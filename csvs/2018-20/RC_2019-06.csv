[],KrakenHasCome,1513052070.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_nz7uc8x,False,"Rather than looking at Noam Chomsky‚Äôs claim as true or false, I think it would be more beneficial to discuss it in terms of whether one agrees or disagrees with his analysis. I‚Äôm not trying to simply argue semantics, but if we think in terms of agreeing/disagreeing rather than true/false, than there is space for both sides to present valid arguments. Than people can decide which side they feel makes the most convincing arguments. 

I generally believe that there is a lot to be said for Chomsky‚Äôs analysis. One of the main justifications for the Vietnam War was the Domino Theory, that communism would spread throughout Southeast Asia. This has sometimes been dismissed as ridiculous, but radical ideologies have often been contagious. Think of the US and French Revolutions, which spread through Europe and Latin America. The revolutions of 1848, starting in Paris and spreading throughout Europe. The rise of fascist ideology/governments in the 1930s. The rise of Islamist movements after the Iran Revolution in 1979. We could go on. 

It makes sense that the US was more interested in preventing the spread of communism (which it detested) to countries where it had a greater geo-political and economic interest. Indochina was not of particular interest to the US prior to the Ho Chi Ming‚Äôs communist government taking power. However, other countries in the region, such as Indonesia, the Philippines, Japan, even India, were all of much greater importance. Many of these countries had growing communist movements, particularly Indonesia, and the US was concerned that a successful Vietnam could serve as a rallying point and base of support for these movements. This makes sense, because the North Vietnamese government gained strength (at least partially) from the success of the communist revolution in China. 

Even though versions of communism did spread to Cambodia and Laos, it did not spread beyond that. While fighting for its existence, Vietnam was not in a position to act as a catalyst for further communist revolutions the way that Cuba did in Latin America and beyond. After the war, Vietnam also could not act as a catalyst, because it was so destroyed. Not to mention that it had to deal with a sociopathic neighbor (Pol Pot). 

As Chomsky mentions, this was not a complete victory for the US, because Vietnam and Indochina was largely lost to the US. However, it did largely succeed in preventing the Domino Theory. Since the Domino Theory was such an important reason for the US‚Äôs entry into Vietnam, I think it could be reasonably argued that the US achieved a major war aim, if not necessarily THE major war aim.",True,False,False,,0,1559348356,,False,0,{},eponpll,False,t3_buzsxe,False,True,t3_buzsxe,/r/history/comments/buzsxe/how_accurate_is_the_claim_that_the_us_achieved/eponpll/,False,,1568679010,6,True,[],False,history,t5_2qh53,r/history,public,0,

*Is this supposed to somehow justify their atrocious behaviour in other fields?*

You're being deliberately obtuse citing something that is a shallow stunt to deflect criticism.

Was Martin being praised by the New Left when he was at the Freedom School/Rampart College in the 1960s with Holocaust Deniers and Segregationists? Because he was associating with Holocaust Denial from at least that point.

Notice how I must provide ever more sources while you just deny anything you don't like and haven't backed up a single statement you have made? [Just who is it college failed?](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/On_the_spot_fallacy)

&gt;They most certainly are. The quotes are spliced up and interlaced with innuendo and commentary.

You said this in a different way once already and did not explain yourself or provide an argument or quotes or sources. I asked you about this and your response is to... do the same thing again. Asserting the opposite does not make you right or make for a compelling argument and it is not evidence.

**Martin told Reason's journalists that he relied on the works of Europe‚Äôs leading Holocaust denier, Paul Rassinier, whose books ‚Äî ‚ÄúDebunking the Genocide Myth,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Drama of European Jewry‚Äù ‚Äî described Nazi concentration camps as ‚Äúa gesture of compassion‚Äù designed by the Nazis to ‚Äúrehabilitate the strayed sheep.‚Äù According to Rassinier, the Holocaust was a ‚Äúswindle‚Äù concocted by money-grubbing Zionists out to ‚Äúmake Germany an ever-lasting milk cow for Israel.‚Äù** Tell me what has been spliced up and edited here and in his other acts of denialism since you claim it is out of context, and don't just assert the opposite or ad hom AGAIN. I was going to ask if you even know who the man is but it seems even here you will stoop to tawdry argumentative tricks to try score a cheap point:

&gt;Well, for one, it omits that Rassinier was a socialist who had spent time in a Nazi concentration camp

*That's called mitigation. Its the classic David Irving tactic, try to minimise and shift blame.*

And in your little history lesson you forget to mention the man is known as the father of Holocaust Denial.

- Legend of the Galactic Heroes (OVA 1988-1997) (Remake 2018-) A great epic space opera with a conflict focused on a corrupt democracy fighting a enlightened despot. Recent remake not a bad adaptation but it is a bit rushed and only covers the first book of 10 original has covered all. My advice watch the two prequel films My Conquest is A Sea of Stars and Overture to a New War (skip the first two episodes of the main series if you do) then the original OVA, Gaiden and then the remake.

- Saga of Tanya the Evil (2017) While the premise is pretty strange in some ways with the main character being the age/gender they are reincarnated into; that aspect exists more to have people underestimate or be fearful of her (and I guess it makes sense lore wise when you think about it). The premise is basically magic World War I (with some WW2 elements) with the author actually throwing in a few historical references here and there. (Tanya)

Some gaming buddies in Sweden are seemingly always taking time off, going on vacation to other places in Europe, etc.  I haven't had a vacation in over 10 years and I work, on average, 6 days a week and 60-70 hours a week... and make less than they do after you factor in things like paying for healthcare and such.  My take-home pay is higher, but after accounting for healthcare premiums, co-pays, medical bills, etc I actually make somewhat less than they do... despite working quite a lot more hours.  If I had kids or a family, I would have less time to spend with them and paternity leave here (which is still mostly in the form of *maternity* leave, with fathers SOL in most cases) is usually 3-9 *weeks* rather than the 9-24 *months* that seems to be more common abroad.

I'm not going to say stuff like this is *why* we have more people ""snapping"" than in other countries... but it might be something to consider.  Those things above contribute to a great deal of stress, and sudden spikes in stress on top of an extended period of lower stress seem to be relevant in whether or not someone ""snaps.""

I would also put social media as a primary factor in there.  When you work so many hours, you don't have a lot of time for socializing... so social media often seems to fill in that gap since humans are social creatures and most of us kinda go a little bonkers if deprived of social interaction for too long (one reason why solitary confinement is generally seen as inhumane if it's ever used for more than very brief periods.)  But I'd argue that replacing genuine socializing (for most people) with social media is alienating and dehumanizing.  It leads to people unironically using that whole ""NPCs"" 4chan joke, which has directly lead to at least a few mass shootings both here and abroad.

The [Fixed-term Parliaments Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-term_Parliaments_Act_2011) created a procedural morass that fucked the UK. What would have happened under the old system is the government would deem its EU Withdrawal Agreement a measure of confidence. That would exert maximum pressure for the ruling parliamentary majority to support the government's position. If this extra bit of leverage caused the vote to succeed, you'd get some form of Brexit with a deal. 

But if the vote failed, on the other hand, that would automatically dissolve parliament and force a new general election. There's no way a government would be able to lose 3 or 4 ""meaningful votes"" on the central political issue of the day and remain in office, which is what the Fixed-term Parliaments Act permits it to do. Since the new election would happen under proportional representation, the a pro-remain majority coalition would presumably be elected, regardless of which or how many constituencies or acres the people who support remain are distributed into. The new parliament would then unilaterally cancel Article 50 or schedule a second referendum. No Brexit.

Done. This isn't that hard.

Yes, I misunderstood some of your points. I measure a federal Europe more on the Federal Republic of Germany, because that‚Äôs what I know and you more on the looser US federation. However, on the question of how to get there, without ending in a Cul-de-Sac, our misunderstanding seems to be that we have very different views on the benevolence of politicians!

Here comes a long post:

What I take away from more than 200 years of modern democracy is that democracies are very bad at peaceful self-renewal. Constitutions evolve over time but the fundamental power structure is barely ever touched even when it has fallen completely out of time. Substantial changes to the power structure only happen after wars or revolutions. (Or if one of the two is imminent) And why would those in power ever reform the system of power? They have already run through the system. Any change could only risk their position. Being responsible for exercising power and structuring it at the same time is the fundamental conflict of interest in all democracies right now.

I think this is the reason why the three oldest modern democracies on the planet, USA, UK, and France, struggle so much right now. Although these are relatively prosperous times for them with a long period of peace.

In the OP I have given the example how the USA have come to a stalemate. However, even though the whole country gets ever more divided, the one thing both parties can agree on is that the two-party system has to be defended at all cost.

When in the UK, in a time before TV, radio or nationwide newspapers, the electoral system emerged it made sense that each constituency voted for the one guy they trusted the most. He would then get on a horse and ride to London to represent them. Sometime later David Cameron called the Brexit referendum because far right UKIP was stealing away conservative Tory votes which, in the by now absurd ‚ÄúWe vote for one guy to get on a horse‚Äù system, would have benefitted the left. Before the Brexit referendum there was another referendum on an electoral reform. But that birthed from the embarrassment of the expenses scandal. Later both big parties started the real project fear and campaigned heavily that democratic choice would mean constant instability. The election reform was downvoted and now the UK government is of course super stable.\^\^

In France, after the revolution, it made sense to elect a quasi-king for 5 years. Sometime later Mitterrand saw grave danger in the amount of power that is given to the French president, but even he later said ‚ÄúWell, now that I am president the republic is safe.‚Äù Today the whole continent shakes in fear with the French elections because someone truly horrible might become king for 5 years.

I think the German system is a relatively good one. But not because Germans are so brilliant, but because Germany is a relatively young democracy. With age more tensions will definitely arise.

Politicians in democracies aren‚Äôt necessarily more or less moral than in dictatorships we just made their interests align with ours. Also, every progressive knows that inaction is the default.

That is why I am suggesting to define the end goal, the utopia, at the beginning and make the system automatically go towards it unless action is taken against it. The pace at which this will happen should be as fast as possible, yet so slow that nobody gets scared and everyone has plenty of time to adapt. The ‚ÄúWe will cross this bridge when we get to it.‚Äù approach has me worried.

[],Ricewynd,1435684405.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_og1gl,False,"My first encounter with a true American obese person. This was in Florida as all true great American tales seem to start, I was around 15 years old, first visit to the states being taken to Disney Land.  
The trip was expensive and my family weren't exactly wealthy, so we'd cut corners where we could to save money. We were staying at a pretty cheap motel on International Drive, it was pretty basic but it did have an All-You-Can-Eat breakfast buffet. Now that buffet was a source of confusion for me from the start, muffins and steak for breakfast? Pancakes? and my first encounter with American Bacon, which isn't bacon guys.

Day one was interesting, we explored the local area in which I discovered we were entirely flanked by McDonalds restaurants, one of which boasts to be the worlds largest, the other is done up like a fancy restaurant, weird but ok.

Day two, people honk at you if you walk, no-one walks anywhere in Florida, the sidewalks are spotless from never being used and sometimes just end. Still trying to get used to the American way, adding tax after the purchase but not displaying it on the price tag, 10 minutes of TV and 30 minutes of commercials. The town I am in is hosting a cheer-leading tournament, everyone is taking it very seriously, an attempt to be polite and ask an innocent question ends in a half hour long lecture from a guy wearing a US Marines cap.  


Day three, it happens.

Now I've seen big people on this trip, sure, its America the people are bigger but I'm not expecting just how big.

I'm at Breakfast, expecting to spend a day at DisneyLand so I'm eating a lot, sausages, waffles, bit of beef hash and some of that weird powder shit you call eggs. Now I should explain the dining area is mostly all booths, they are arranged in a lazy crescent shape so, sitting at one end, I can clearly see the table at the other end. In the typical youthful innocence I exude back then I had assumed the other end table was being used to store extra food, it's piled high with trays of shit, not plates, full trays of every imaginable thing on that breakfast menu. A few times a chef comes out and adds to the pile. Someone has covered the seats with a mound of tarps and i think nothing of it, until the fucking tarp moves.

It's not a mound of tarps its a fucking person.

She was huge and I'm not talking fat, I'm talking Gigantic. If she went swimming at the beach she would raise the global water level, she is so titanically massive if she fell over the blast radius would be 17 miles. And she is hungry, by god is she hungry.

The tables we are all at are bolted to the ground, the seats are attached to them so you cannot move the seat or the table, but she has. The table is 'raised' off the ground on one side, you can see the screws dangling, the metal bar that connects the seats to the table is bending backwards, quite alarmingly, and yet this is not enough. Her fat rolls engulf one side of the table, you cannot visibly see the edge. The chairs go in three deep and she is taking up all of them and yet more of her spills over the side. It is a horrific sight.

She finished a bowl of cereal and adds it to THE TOWER of bowls. Her left arms is twice the size of my entire body. I fight the urge to stand up, salute and sing the American national anthem as she picks up a tray of bacon and merrily consumes more food than me and the rest of my family combined would eat that entire week.  
But what really got me, was just how normal it seemed. No-one was reacting to this, the manager wasn't having a fit and trying to charge her extra, the chefs were keeping the regular buffet topped up as well as her own personal one with a level of blank faced professionalism I'd expect at the Ivy. No-one else in the place was looking at her, everyone was acting as if this was just another day and now I feel bad for staring and yet, by no stretch of the imagination was she the largest person I saw.

I was aware of the stereotypes, we all were, living in Europe we got a lot of larger Americans, fanny-packs, &lt;insert Army Division here&gt; flat caps, beige slacks, blocking up the isles at museum exhibits, but nothing like this.

The only way we could stop it, as an EU member, is if it were subject to veto, which *de jure* federalisation would be because it'd represent a treaty change (the biggest possible).

- [in a follow up to an earlier answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/88a0qu/why_did_the_spanish_conquest_of_mexico_end_up/dwowehk/) I talk about this question; and in some more length in that thread [about judicial and political effects of European contact in central Mexico](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/88a0qu/why_did_the_spanish_conquest_of_mexico_end_up/dwj6qnl/).

- and in another thread I discuss [Spanish control over colonial Mexico and resistance to it](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/8q2lfr/in_the_wake_of_the_defeat_of_the_aztecs_where_did/e0tody9/?context=3). 

In order to not just throw in these older (quite long) answers here I'm summing up their main points below, hope this helps: 


The Aztec Triple Alliance was dominated by the Mexica (of Tenochtitlan) decades before the Spanish conquest. While different native groups had different reasons to join forces with the Spanish, resistance to the Mexica was a common thread : For tributary states, the tributes they had to pay to Tenochtitlan were seen as too high ; for enemies of the Triple Alliance like Tlaxcala, resistance also made sense, as a way to escape the isolation their state was in, surrounded by Triple Alliance territories. 

And even former members of the Alliance switched sides : the Acolhua were in the grips of a civil war at the time of conquest, with the faction opposed to the Mexica providing assistance to the Spanish. The point being that there were a variety of reasons for siding with the Spanish, but that for many Nahua groups it made sense in order to overthrow the Mexica who were often perceived as ¬´ tyrannic ¬ª.

How the Tlaxcalans and others perceived themselves during the conquest is hard to answer ‚Äì our only eyewitness accounts come from Spaniards (who don't mention native allies all that much). Native accounts come starting in the mid-16th century, and are already colored by the colonial society. But briefly put, these native histories highlight both the centrality of the large numbers of native allies to the conquest (which was for real), and the special importance of their own state to the conquests' ¬´ success ¬ª (which is more debatable in each case).

 I'd argue here that the native allies' position was somewhere in between those two poles : clearly the Spanish could not have managed to overthrow the Mexica without the massive help of Tlaxcalans, Huejotzincans and others, which they would have probably been aware of. On the other hand, the Spanish did have some serious military advantages vis-a-vis their allies (e.g. swords and horses) due to which e.g. the Tlaxcalans would have probably seen themselves as the most important native allies but under Spanish command.

The Spanish initially left many native rulers in power, as subordinates to the Spanish Crown; and made possible lawsuits by indigenous elites and even commoners to litigate for their rights before courts. In addition, both conquistadors and native nobles at first profited from intermarrying to forge dynastic connections and legitimacy. These together with various other factors - a major one being the increasingly devastating epidemies - meant that there was serious incentive for many Nahua states to accept the Spanish as one more among a longer lineage of conquerors in central Mesoamerica. This did not mean however that Spanish rule was secure in the early colonial period.

------

I'm discussing the question of when the Spanish rule was pretty much secure over colonial Mexico in more detail in the 2nd answer I linked to, so just the main points here from that one: the Mixton War in the 1540s was probably the last serious challenge to Spanish overrule in colonial Mexico. This was a major military campaign by the Mixtecs that was only won through the Spanish through personal intervention by the viceroy. 

Looking further afield though, the Spanish never controlled all of New Spain (the name of the Spanish viceroyalty then) ‚Äì as was the case in many other parts of Spanish America. Two areas that would prove esp. difficult to conquer and raised resistance throughout colonial times were Northern regions (like Nueva Galicia and Nuevo Mexico), and Yucat√°n.

These led to major Spanish campaigns with important assistance of native allies throughout the 17th c. and later, not always successful. So that while central Mexico was an important imperial centre by the mid 16th century, other regions of central America were only partly or not under full Spanish control throughout the colony.",True,False,False,,0,1559390918,,1559391426,0,{},eppt0k6,False,t3_bvj5hc,False,True,t3_bvj5hc,/r/AskHistorians/comments/bvj5hc/why_did_the_natives_side_with_the_spanish/eppt0k6/,False,,1568698023,10,True,[],False,AskHistorians,t5_2ssp3,r/AskHistorians,public,0,

Nowhere was this more evident in Italy, my own area of interest, where the political elite contained a segment of prosperous urban professionals, some of which were educated in institutions whose modern descendants are still active today. 

Of course, that is not to say Medieval Europe was not a place beset by stark inequality, or that the professional service industry was the largest component of the economy. Medieval Europe was indeed a very unequal society, and most people's economic activity was agriculture. While towns and cities did exist, many more people lived in small country hamlets. In many regions, large landowners could indeed unfairly exploit their tenants (""Help help, I'm being oppressed!""). However, in other regions small landholders were the majority, with few large magnates renting plots of land. In other regions still, a mix of small and large landowners coexisted with renters and serfs. But each individual region of Europe was characterized by its own social distinctions, shaped by their individual history and institutions. To again offer the example of Italy, while the North was characterized by many small landowners who participated frequently in the economic life of nearby cities and towns, in the South landed magnates were much more powerful. This, along with other factors, allowed for the creation of a single unified state in the South (whose main threat to stability came from internal upheavals) while the North experienced political fragmentation (whose existential threats were instead characterized by external rivalries). Not only did political organization develop different shades, but so did social organization. Across the Western Mediterranean and beyond, landowners could establish presences in cities and invest in commercial enterprises, while prosperous urban professionals, merchants, and artisans could purchase estates in the countryside. In some cities, like Florence, membership in a Merchant Guild was an important part of political enfranchisement, even if the member in question did not practice their guild's trade themselves (investment in an enterprise, or mere association with someone who did, was enough). In other cities, like Milan, land ownership remained an important component of political enfranchisement. Many times, prosperous urbanites could clash with suburban landowners, as could small landowners with large landowners, or the urban poor pit themselves against the urban rich. 

It is also important to keep in mind that Europe dramatically changed over the centuries called ""the middle ages."" In the eighth century, Italy was torn apart by war pitting the Byzantine Empire against the Lombard Kingdom, while in modern France the Carolingian Dynasty was founding an Empire, and England was divided amongst seven competing kingdoms. Two centuries later, Italy and Germany would experience an intellectual reawakening under the Ottonian dynasty, while in France the monarchy was experiencing a resurgence after a steep decline, and England was divided in two between the Danes and Anglo-Saxons.

The role of universities changed over the centuries as well. The earliest Universities, and I'm using the word in the broadest possible sense, were documented as early as the tenth century. But the inclusion of more modern courses of study like engineering (just as an example) would only really begin in earnest in the 19th century as Polytechnic Universities emerged offering courses adapted to industrialized society. Indeed for much of the Medieval period and beyond, in many professions training and certification would have been regulated by individual guilds, who set rules for apprenticeship and mastery of their respective arts. While having a family relative in a guild was seldom an explicit prerequisite for membership (prosperous artisans and professionals were often on the lookout for fresh manpower to take on as apprentices) having a trusted family member who knew the ropes could be a valuable boost when navigating the complex world of Medieval Guilds. 

In the broadest sense, the earliest western european universities were collections of practitioners in law and theology. This is what was being taught at the time of the medieval founding dates of the oldest universities in Europe, like Bologna or Oxford. But while there is indeed evidence of students being taught by master practitioners in the eleventh century (indicating that teaching was probably already well established) it would be an enormous stretch to assume these lessons world have born resemblance to modern institutions of higher learning.

In this earliest period (prior to the twelfth and thirteenth centuries) a university education would have been entirely religious in nature, geared to preparing a student for a life in the clergy. Nearly other professions would have been managed by an apprenticeship system, with degrees of formalization varying from place to place. It is also true that, in Italy at least, the destructiveness of the Lombard Wars had favored a social system where disproportionately wealthy individuals with time and resources could dedicate themselves to studying things like law and architecture on their own, developing mastery across multiple topics (think along the lines of designing their own palaces and castles, while also concocting legal arguments against their political enemies; an early Doge of Venice, Pietro Orseolo, was one such polymath). But in a society with a close relationship between religion, politics, and law, centers of religious teaching soon also became centers of legal study. Under the Ottonian Empire, the collection of scholars in the town of Pavia became one such center, validated by monarchs preferring Pavia it to the larger but more unruly city of Milan nearby. Pavia's status was later formalized in the 14th century by the rulers of Milan, and remains the seat of a University to this day. Universities could also spring up where there was the opportunity to exchange ideas: Padua and Bologna, for example, were longstanding Byzantine outposts in Italy, where Imperial Laws were still rigorously enforced and aspiring scholars could easily recover religious and legal texts. Thus Padua and Bologna had been welcoming students for centuries long before their universities were formally founded in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries respectively. There were also many other cities in Italy where renowned practitioners resided who could also offer students a instruction deemed valid; some of these were later recognized and formalized, while others were not. And finally, in many of these places concentrated knowledge of Latin and Greek facilitated the outgrowth of additional topics of study, like philosophy and medicine.  

The kind of person which would move to Bologna, Padua, or Pavia in order to study would have been a person of means aspiring for a career in the law, in the church, and in later centuries, as a medical practitioner (but not a surgeon; that was considered a separate, more tradesman-like profession). But the great dynasties of Medieval Europe, however, could afford tutors to come to them and prepare their children for the rigors of political life, even if their children were to enter a career in the clergy. So the profile of the average university student, such as we can attempt identify, would be wealthy, but not too wealthy. And it's also important to keep in mind that while the kinds of students in universities were upper-middle-class (or lower-upper-class) not all upper-middle-class youngsters learned their trade in universities. Prosperous moneychangers, wool merchants, and other tradesmen whose guild education was considered just as formal could indeed inherit or develop large and lucrative enterprises. Through their guilds, they could even develop political influence and connections, all without an education from the universities.",True,False,False,,0,1559392981,,1560874268,0,{},eppvn7u,False,t3_buon8l,False,False,t3_buon8l,/r/AskHistorians/comments/buon8l/which_class_of_the_social_pyramid_or_which/eppvn7u/,False,,1568699253,7,True,[],False,AskHistorians,t5_2ssp3,r/AskHistorians,public,0,

The agreement only works so long as it is enforceable. If the UK decided that it no longer wanted to abide by the terms of the agreement it could unilaterally decide to leave, however this would be akin to a no deal Brexit. The backstop also originated as a British proposal to solve the Irish border problem, this isn't some EU invention being forced upon the British people.

Whilst I do believe that a lot of the economic forecasts were exaggerated, it is important to remember that we are still in the EU. The economic system has not changed, the only thing liable to change at the moment would be confidence. Whilst I similarly believe that forecasts of a No Deal Brexit are also exaggerated, I do believe that economically the UK will be worse off - most Brexiteers even accept this but believe it is an acceptable cost for democracy or other Brexit issues. Rory Stewart has raised important concerns over the British automobile industry and its ability to export/ compete with cheap foreign exports in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. Patrick Minford, an economist in favour of Brexit, admitted that the British automobile industry would be run into the ground but in the long run this would be OK as the British economy would shift to service-based tertiary level employment instead, and yet car manufacturing accounts for 12%, close to a million jobs, of the British economy. Without heavy subsidies/ tariffs its likely the industry would struggle to cope with a No Deal Brexit, but maybe I'm wrong, I'm not an economist.

If you may allow me, may I offer a critique of your position. You don't seem to especially engage in the benefits of leaving the European Union, at least you have mentioned any in this discourse.

What identity crises? Why is it that Armenians call themselves as an Indo-European people when you are genetically the most similar to the Semitic Assyrians and Iraqis? Not much is known about Urartian as well, some speculate they were the ancestors of the Nakh peoples and not the Armenians. I have never seen a single Azerbaijani claim Urartu either.

Azerbaijani people are Turkic as well. You can drop the pure nonsense. Nobody on this planet is pure. Our ancestors were Seljuk Turkmen who mixed with the locals when we conquered the region. Intermixing between Persians, Caucasians and Anatolians by the Seljuks is well recorded. 

Do not conflate the insecurities of others on our people. Persian nationalists claiming ""Azerbaijanis wuz pure iranics n shiet who wuz Turkified by 200 mongol samurai warriors from Japan, you have no Turkic genetikikics."" Is bullshit claim that should not be brushed onto us either. 

&gt;The are lots of reasons why we are more liked, despite the caviar diplomacy of your country. But that is limited to the Western world mainly. The views of the Muslim countries are different. 

Such as? What views of the Muslim countries? They support you because they are uneducated and morons. Arabs have never been good at choosing friends, look at what the British ended up doing to the region. These Arabs who support Armenians because ""Armenians wuz so similar to us. Armenians love us. Armenia and Arabs deep history. Armenians love Islam and respect it."" Are fucking delusional.

&gt;Because whatever the crimes were committed by Armenians, they don't stand close in the sheer volume, scale, and cruelty to the ones committed against us. Neither Turkey nor Azerbaijan are anywhere close to accepting any crimes they made, quite the opposite. So why should we? If Armenians killed 1.5 million Azeris in 1918 and then continued claiming ""duh the Azeris were resisting and trying to kill us in return, so they deserved it"", how would you feel? I suppose the words ""we have our share of blame"" wouldn't appear out of your mouth.

Let me guess Azerbaijan killed 1.5 million Armenians? I never knew Azerbaijanis in the Caucasus traveled all the way to Anatolia to kill Armenians. Vay vay vay. Also since when did it become 1.5 million? 

At first it was 500,000. Then a decade later it became 800,000. Then it became 1,000,000. I had seen 1,200,000 and now today I see 1,500,000. Why do the figures inflate every decade?

Munderloh and her colleague Timothy Kurtti had grown and examined a rickettsial species discovered by Willy, WB-8‚Äì2, and had isolated another of these strange rickettsias, MOAa, but they couldn‚Äôt figure out where they‚Äôd come from. They asked Weller to analyze their genomes in the same way that 23andMe decodes the ancestry of humans: by sequencing parts of the genome and tracking back the genes that had been passed down from generation to generation. Weller accepted the challenge and ran a genetic analysis, and she discovered a puzzling thing: while the bulk of the rickettsias‚Äô genomes were closely related to R. montana (now R. montanensis), parts were from an Old World species, not a North American one.

&gt;The corporate media march in lock step with the United States and its allies around the world. They have a tacit agreement to exclude any information which might inconvenience pro-war, pro-interventionist narratives.

&gt;Claims of chemical weapons use by the Syrian government are but one example of this tactic. These improbable stories have been repeated with regularity ever since the United States and its allies began using jihadist proxies to overthrow the Syrian government in 2011. In 2013 we were told that president Assad waged a chemical weapons attack on the same day that United Nations weapons inspectors arrived in the country. It is an understatement to say that this scenario is unlikely to be true.

&gt;In 2018 the U.S. and its European allies repeated that they would take military action against Syria if there were any reports of chemical weapons use. Like clockwork, such an event was reported and a bombing campaign took place in April of that year.

&gt;Anyone with common sense should doubt these reports. Assad had no reason to do anything which guaranteed military attacks on his country. Furthermore, persons with credibility and expertise had already provided evidence that these claims are nothing but false flags meant to get public buy-in for aggression.

-------------

&gt;The U.S. Congress came very close to calling for a Syrian war in a May 20, 2019 letter signed by 70% of its members . The AIPAC inspired massive calls for president Trump to ‚Äústabilize‚Äù Syria, protect Israel and stop Russian and Iranian influence. The call was bipartisan and bicameral with 79 senators and 303 members of the house signing on to the call for imperialism. Presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Cory Booker are among those calling for the dangerous slippery slope. Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) chairwoman Karen Bass signed too as did Hakeem Jeffries, James Clyburn, and Elijah Cummings among others.

&gt;Americans have been fed a steady diet of ‚ÄúAssad the butcher‚Äù and any counter narrative is disappeared, just like the OPCW leak. It is a useful ploy to have around. Let us not forget that last year‚Äôs bombing resulted in praise from the so-called resistance crowd who think they are supporting a humanitarian action.

The majority of recognized tribes have ""Indian"" in the name.  These are sovereign nations with their own laws and they can change their official name at any time. I'm not native, but I have worked professionally for two large tribes and I've spent my entire life around Indians. They will always refer to themselves as Indians, especially in an informal setting. In formal situations (i.e. in the company of non-tribal elected officials, or in the company or certain other non-tribal people) they often refer to themselves as native, and then sometimes/rarely as Native American.

""Indian"" is certainly a misnomer, but it's not derogatory or improper. Not having spent time around Indians, it is understandable someone might believe it is wrong, but it is really irritating when people who don't know about these things believe they are doing everyone a favor by imposing the ""correct"" term. Referring to Hispanics as Latin is also a huge misnomer, but no one ever corrects another for using it. Latins were an ancient hill tribe from Italy. Hell, even Hispanic is a misnomer for describing central American indigenous peoples. ""Anglo"" is commonly used as a blanket description of people of European descent, but Anglo comes from Angle, a Germanic tribe that settled in Britain. Genetically, only English people and the contemporary descendants on the lower Jutland peninsula are Anglos, but no one has any problems referring to Poles, Swedes, Spaniards, Swiss, etc., as Anglos.

Once you have established that it's okay to impose your preferred government form by violent force, you lose the high ground when it comes to complain about someone imposing theirs over yours in turn.

&gt;The reactionaries like to use violence, and are usually better at it. Don't drop down to their level, they're at the advantage there.

So, what's your suggestion then? Sit tight and watch as they destroy the 8-hour day? Sit tight and watch as they force us to work 7 days a week? Sit tight and watch as we see safety regulations being thrown out of the window to reduce costs despite the fact that this endangers our lives? Sit tight and watch as they exploit more and more laborers, especially the ones who are below the poverty line and often have no choice but to take any job they can get? Should we sit out and watch them exploit the most vulnerable members of our society?

&gt;Which would have resulted in exactly nothing but corpses and bludgeonings without a reformist wing to anchor that pressure in the legislation, step by step.

You're kidding, right? Don't try to co-opt the struggle of the Haymarket Martyrs. Just don't.

&gt;Sure, that's a normal evolution. Parties evolve from ideologically pure and totally irrelevant, by growing more and more pragmatic, increasing effectivity and reducing ideological purity, until they are faceless parties that do whatever keeps them in power. They usually have started to lose votes long before that, and will become more and more irrelevant again. But that's not important, parties are not important, they are throwaway tools: what is important is what they achieve while circling down towards the drain.

And what they have achieved is fairly simple. The continuous deterioration of the conditions of the working class all around the world. This is what is feeding the far-right. This is why you hear people ""pining for the good ol' days"". You can't keep making people poorer and poorer and then expect them to be content.

&gt;This does not answer why you should only aim for revolution and not for reformism while we're waiting for the revolution to happen. If you succeed in combating neoliberal policies without revolution you don't need a revolution anymore.

Because no ""reformist"" entity is trying to combat neoliberal policies. Neoliberalism has been running unopposed within the EU (and other major economic powers) for at least the past 30 years (it could be more but I wasn't born before that so I can't judge). There is no ""reformist wing"" that is trying to pressure the legislation and make the situation better for workers. Not one that has ever had any sort of power to do something about it, at least.

&gt;Do you honestly think the far right would collapse without the EU as bogeyman? Hello?

The far-right would find another boogeyman, that's a given. But would that boogeyman be as effective as the EU currently is? Because, you have to admit, the EU makes for a damn good boogeyman since it has contributed significantly to the impoverishment of the working classes across the continent.

&gt;Now you're affirming it yourself: yes, the individual member states are hostile to refugees. Even more so, and EU courts have been a backstop against them reducing refugee rights further. So reducing EU influence will not improve the refugee situation.

The states, yes. Not the people.

&gt;The EU is after all still democratic and can't impose an open border policy on its members.

Is it? I remember when Greece was not allowed to leave the monetary union 4 years ago. That didn't seem very democratic to me.

&gt;That's anecdotal evidence. Look at the election results. Or just try to run with an open border programme. Don't wear new clothes, you won't dodge all rotten eggs.

I can tell you that in my country, at least, a party that was running with an open border program did win the last national elections. It lost the EU elections a week ago and it may lose the next national elections in July but that's for reasons that aren't all that connected to the refugee situation.

&gt;Well, how am I going to break it to you: consider that half of them are worse than average, that's just a fact..

What are you talking about here? IQ scores? Who gives a shit about that? Recognizing what your rights are and who fights for them is pretty damn easy. It doesn't take a genius to do that.

&gt;Votes for the extreme right aren't based on facts, you're not going to get them out of it by a quiet rational explanation. Please come over and prove me wrong, we've got 12-18% of the electorate here to practice on. Their latest trick is to copy the program of the left with the ""* not for foreigners"" clause attached. Argue against that.

Votes for the far-right are based on anger. An anger that is based on the further deterioration of the material conditions of the working class. Why do you think that the far-right wasn't even voted by 1% of the electorate before the financial crisis? The rise of fascism is always fueled by a financial crisis. That was true in the Inter-War period and it is true now.

&gt;Lol. Without Schengen, you take away the right of labor to move freely... without any guarantees at all on refugee rights. In fact, many countries have already made very clear they are very displeased with the quota, so they certainly won't take more, and the national election trends certainly don't testify of a refugee-friendly stream that is somehow hamstrung by the. In fact, the agreements at the EU level do not, in any way, forbid states to receive more refugee candidates. So you're just throwing worker rights under the bus for nothing.

So, you think that the right to be exploited in the Netherlands, in Spain or Romania is a worker right? Freedom of movement for workers in the EU isn't set up to benefit the workers. It's set up to benefit their bosses.

&gt;See, that's the absolute claim of ideological purity again. For us, or against us. You're about as intolerant as the far right to people of different views. They also consider everyone who doesn't automatically accept their ukases against migrants as part of the big traitor conspiracy against the people. I'm really sick of 19th century identity politics.

Ideological purity? And you played the ""identity politics"" card, too? That's just rich.

&amp;#x200B;

* Roosevelt beats Wilson in the 1912 election and becomes president, and joins the great war several months after the sinking of the Lusitania.
* The US joining helps relieve the Russians as German troops are sent west, allowing them to recover and eventually the Germans are forced to sue for peace in 1917, with the victory providing public support for the provisional government which establishes a democracy in Russia during the 1920s.
* Austria-Hungary collapses, as does the Ottoman empire. A Polish vassal state (of Russia) is created as a buffer between Germany and Russia, while Serbia creates the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Britain supports the Hashemites in creating an Arab state from the former Ottoman holdings and defeating their rivals on the peninsula, while a Shia state is created in Mesopotamia. The peace terms are much less harsh on Germany than in our timeline, allowing them to keep some of their colonies and not forcing heavy reparations on them. Over time the cost of the great war and the lives lost created a mentality that war should never again be fought in Europe, and this is mirrored in France with the French and Germans signing a non-aggression pact in the 1930s, with their relationship gradually mending over time.
* Like in our timeline Mussolini takes over Italy while Japan becomes increasingly aggressive in the east, eventually launching an invasion of China in 1937
* The invasion and subsequent atrocities committed by the Japanese cause Britain and the US to place sanctions on Japan in 1940, stopping most exports to it and this causes Japan to retaliate, attacking American and European territories like in our timeline, causing Britain, France and the US to declare war on Japan, while Italy invades British colonies in Africa.
* After several years, Italy is defeated and occupied while Japan falls into civil war as the result of an Anglo-American blockade and bombing campaign.
* After the war, Britain starts to re-organise their holdings abroad to make the empire more workable, merging some colonies to form new dominions and creating an imperial council, giving the dominions autonomy, while similar efforts are made by most other European empires.

**Article**:

&gt; ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) ‚Äî The tagline makes the solution sound so simple: ‚ÄúGamble responsibly.‚Äù

&gt; It‚Äôs anything but for those who struggle with compulsive gambling. Instead, the footnote caps a powerful new temptation as ads for sports betting emerge in states that have recently legalized an activity once banned in most of the United States.

&gt; Sharon, a 39-year-old homemaker, decided with her husband to move from New Jersey to New York specifically to get away from legalized sports betting, but still sees ads frequently that remind her of the tens of thousands of dollars in debt she racked up on a wagering app.

&gt; Charlie, an information technology professional from suburban Philadelphia, says the advertisements and easy access makes wagering ‚Äútempting as hell,‚Äù even as his losses mounted to $400,000 as he bet online while traveling on service calls.

&gt; They‚Äôve complicated addiction recovery for Gary, a real estate agent from New Jersey who attends support group meetings and has lost nearly $2 million over a lifetime of gambling.

&gt; ‚ÄúIt seems like every fourth commercial, there‚Äôs one telling you how easy it is to bet on sports and make money,‚Äù said Gary, who like other gamblers spoke to The Associated Press on condition that his full name not be used because of stigmas some people associate with unhealthy gambling.

&gt; ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs right in front of my eyes, and even though I‚Äôve been in recovery for years and go regularly to Gamblers Anonymous meetings, it‚Äôs starting to bother me,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI can feel it.‚Äù

&gt; Advertising supporting the nascent sports betting industry has not drawn the same level of scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers in the U.S. as counterparts in Europe, where several countries strictly regulate or even ban gambling ads, including those for sports betting.

&gt; One year after the U.S. Supreme Court ended an effective monopoly in Nevada, eight states have begun taking legal sports wagers. Three states and the District of Columbia have passed laws to create new markets and a handful of legislatures are still considering bills. None of the laws passed have significant restrictions for sports betting ads.

&gt; The commercial casino industry wants to keep it that way.

&gt; The American Gaming Association, the gambling industry‚Äôs main trade group and lobbying arm, recently issued voluntary guidelines for sports betting advertising in a bid to stay ahead of possible government regulation, drawing on the experience of the liquor industry to develop self-regulations.

&gt; ‚ÄúWe want to get in front of this in a way that is meaningful,‚Äù said Sara Slane, the group‚Äôs senior vice president of public affairs. ‚ÄúWe view the opportunity to offer sports betting on a state-by-state level as a privilege, and there needs to be responsible advertising that‚Äôs tied to that.‚Äù

&gt; Indeed, those who struggle with gambling find ads touting Super Bowl or March Madness wagers similar to beer ads tempting those with alcoholism or fast food ads enticing those with unhealthy eating habits. Though a hurdle for some, the ads are an understandable facet of expanded betting with sportsbooks chasing new customers to bet legally and leisurely, just like millions of people who visit casinos, buy lottery tickets or drink and eat without harmful consequences.

&gt; ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not one commercial break it seems where you don‚Äôt see one of these ads. As much as I tried to stop, there are all these incentives: a $500 free bet, we‚Äôll refund your first bet even if you lose. They‚Äôre everywhere I look,‚Äù said Sharon, who lives in a New York TV market that‚Äôs a key target for advertisers of New Jersey sportsbooks. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a constant reminder of my problem. It brings an incredible amount of guilt and shame for me, and yet there‚Äôs still this incredible temptation that these ads make worse.‚Äù

&gt; Keith Whyte, executive director of the National Council on Problem Gambling, thinks the details of gambling ads haven‚Äôt been explored enough.

&gt; ‚ÄúIn the U.S., if you say, ‚ÄòGamble responsibly,‚Äô you‚Äôve now met the responsible gambling standard,‚Äù Whyte said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be a big issue. There‚Äôs heightened concern for people struggling with gambling addiction and relapse. And I don‚Äôt see a lot of discussion about this.‚Äù

&gt; Major sportsbooks all say they train their workers to spot people with potential gambling problems, offering various solutions including self-imposed betting ‚Äútimeouts‚Äù for those who want them. In New Jersey, some money from licensing fees for sports betting fund c...

&gt;""The size and makeup of measles outbreaks has changed since the 1980s. Prior to 1989, the majority of outbreaks occurred among middle, high school and college student populations. As many as 95% of persons infected during these outbreaks had received one prior dose of measles vaccine. A second dose of measles vaccine was recommended for school-aged children in 1989, and all states now require two doses of measles vaccine for school-aged children. As a result, measles outbreaks in school settings are now uncommon.  
&gt;  
&gt;In 2008 a total of 140 measles cases was reported, the largest annual total since 1996. Eighty nine percent of these cases were imported from or associated with importations from other countries, particularly countries in Europe where several outbreaks are ongoing. Persons younger than 20 years of age accounted for 76% of the cases; 91% were in persons who were unvaccinated (most because of personal or religious beliefs) or of unknown vaccination status. The increase in the number of cases of measles in 2008 was not a result of a greater number of imported measles cases. It was the result of more measles transmission after the virus was imported. The importation-associated cases occurred largely among school-aged children who were eligible for vaccination but whose parents chose not to have them vaccinated. Many of these children were home-schooled and not subject to school entry vaccination requirements.  
&gt;  
&gt;In 2011, CDC reported 16 outbreaks of measles and 220 measles cases, most of which were imported cases in unvaccinated persons. Among the U.S. measles cases in persons 16 months through 19 years reported in 2011, 62% were in persons not vaccinated for a nonmedical reason.""",True,False,False,,0,1559407269,,False,0,{},epqk8vj,False,t3_bvg4uw,False,True,t1_epqie0o,/r/antivax/comments/bvg4uw/it_do_be_like_that/epqk8vj/,False,,1568710826,1,True,[],False,antivax,t5_2uz12,r/antivax,public,0,

In law, common law (also known as judicial precedent or judge-made law, or case law) is that body of law derived from judicial decisions of courts and similar tribunals.  The defining characteristic of ‚Äúcommon law‚Äù is that it arises as precedent.  In cases where the parties disagree on what the law is, a common law court looks to past precedential decisions of relevant courts, and synthesizes the principles of those past cases as applicable to the current facts.  If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past, the court is usually bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision (a principle known as stare decisis).

**English contract law**

English contract law is a body of law regulating contracts in England and Wales. With its roots in the lex mercatoria and the activism of the judiciary during the industrial revolution, it shares a heritage with countries across the Commonwealth (such as Australia, Canada, India), and to a lesser extent the United States. It is also experiencing gradual change because of the UK's membership of the European Union and international organisations like Unidroit. Any agreement that is enforceable in court is a contract.

Have you considered the tone with which you ask?

&gt; Transgender people make really odd claims.

See, this kinda shit is problematic. You call people ""odd"" - people who live their entire lives being dehumanized because they're ""odd"" or ""weird"" or ""sick"" or ""messed up"" - and wonder why people are impatient. You may not intend the same, but you should look at yourself when oppressed people are impatient with you, not them.

&gt; Like, what does it mean to identify as a certain gender? I legit have no idea. As far as I can tell, gender norms are just a social construct.

Gender is a social norm mapped onto the ways in which we express ourselves and the roles we fill in society (an oversimplification). People who identify as a certain gender are expressing where they feel they fit into that sociological map.

&gt; If a male claims to be a woman, what does that imply?

That she's a woman, and not a male.

&gt; Is the desire to literally be biologically female?

If you mean getting surgery, then for some, not others.

&gt; That doesn't make the male into a female though

Yes, it does.

&gt; Because the traditional definition would simply be a human female, but this is a male.

This isn't the ""traditional definition."" It's the Eurocentric definition, because European capitalism invented these norms. There's nothing natural or inherent about it.

&gt; Is a woman someone who desires to be female? Or is a woman someone who desires to conform to conventional social gender roles? Is it a desire to be treated as a woman? What does that even mean?

These are deep questions, for sure, and there's a lot of scholarship about it. If you want to learn, there are many theories on this. But you need to be careful with your language. I'm willing to bet that somebody has already told you that a trans woman is not, in any sense, a man, but you're still trying to claim that. I have serious doubts that you're open minded, but I hope I'm wrong.

[],SaifEdinne,1515714678.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_rneoh6x,False,"&gt;I‚Äôm not denying the role of the french in the revolution, not in the least, my point was that the colonists were the catalyst for the revolution, the French didn‚Äôt come fight the war for the Americans, the Americans picked up arms and said this is not right and we are going to make it right. My point is change starts with the people.

Whether the cause for rebellion was just or not is up for debate but yes, it started with some of the colonists rising up.

&gt;Your point about the world wars is accurate, and yes we did wait until we were attacked to formally declare war but we were very much so supporting the allied effort, and had we not gotten involved what language do you think you would be speaking today? My money is on German.

That isn't the point. You are claiming that the U.S. were always beacons of freedom and defenders of democracy, but when the Nazis were attacking the Western democracy, they waited untill the last moment. And if I remember correctly, it were the Russians that actually defeated the Germans, they were the ones that actually invested a lot of time, manpower and effort into this.

But afterwards it were the Americans that defended Western Europe from the Sovjets, yes.

&gt;Also if you want to talk all kinds of shit based on what you have seen on the news that is awesome, but if you ever get a chance to go to Iraq, Afghanistan or any of these other countries and actually talk to the people to see what it meant to them to have an American presence in their country then you will find the the vast majority found great stability and prosperity as they were allowed not only to work and live their lives they were also able to keep their money, property and freedoms without having to worry about things like paying off the taliban or whoever, I mean I get it it‚Äôs easy to hide behind a screen and screech all of this

I live in a very multicultural city. My neighbours are Syrian, my friends are Iranian, Tsetsenian, Iraqi, Turkish, ... I studied with a Palestinian, a Thai and a Greek. I think my world knowledge are genuine when considering this. So yes, I do know how Iraqis feel when talking about how the U.S. destroyed their homecountry for no valid reason at all, how they left the country after creating a power vacuum that ISIS could fill in. How the U.S. created extremism in Iraq which ISIS capitalized on to increase their power.

So no, I'm not ""screeching"" behind a screen, I'm talking real sentiments that actually lives in, at least, a big part of the Iraqi people. Hell, the whole world acknowledges the major error the U.S. did in Iraq and their responsibility regarding ISIS, except for the U.S. and Israel.

And regarding the Taliban, how is the U.S. ""fighting"" the Taliban while supporting Saudi Arabia who are backing the Taliban with weapons, supplies, generals, intell, ... ?? It's more like that the U.S. are strengthening the Taliban with their drone strikes that causes the countless civilian deaths that lead to more extremism on which the Taliban feeds on.

&gt;As far as the formation of isis, it would be silly to blame America for that, let‚Äôs put blame for that where it needs to be, Islam, that is why isis exists, it‚Äôs the same reason the taliban existed/exists, why the mubjahdine before them existed and why so many times in history this group of people have done the exact same stuff. It would be like blaming Someone else for the klan, you can‚Äôt, the blame for that sits solely in the lap of white anglo Protestants.

For real? Islam? So Islam, that encompasses a quarter of the World population is the cause of extremism that for 90% of the time rises in war torn countries? What a damn coincidence. Where is the Extremism in Turkey? Or in Morocco? Peacefull countries, yet no trace of extremism, explain that.

ISIS is a direct result of the unjust Iraq-War that lead to a power vacuum. The Taliban is a direct result of Afghan war orphans that were tutored by uneducated Imams in Pakistani madrassas following an extremist Pakistani Sunni sect.

The Muhjuhadeen were a direct result on the aggression of the Russians in Afghanistan, you could call them Patriots. That's what they were, actual Afghan Patriots. See what nationalism leads to?

&gt;most of those Latin American countries were about to fall to soviet communism much like Cuba did, and Incase you didn‚Äôt know the Soviet Union was another epic oppressor.

So what if the people CHOOSE to follow a communist economic form? Why should the U.S. impose their will on the choice of the people? Isn't it a democracy? Lesser of 2 evils, tell that to Vietnam. Tell me, in what case was it really ""the lesser of 2 evils"". Tell me of one case.

&gt;but do you know why? It was to maintain stability and the relative peace that was and still is very very fragile.

Why are you talking in circles. First you're talking about attacking Iraq to bring ""freedom and democracy"" to the Iraqis and now you're saying that Sadam was need for peace and stability? If it were really so, why did the U.S. still wage war against him in the end? You're contradicting yourself.

&gt;most of the time it is because at the end of the day, we get the short end of the stick, or our elected representatives reject it, or it turns out that it isn‚Äôt in our best interest.

The only ""treaty"" I can think of is NATO where the U.S. is at the short end of the stick. The Paris Climate Agreement is a world wide effort to save the planet, the U.S. is just being greedy here. The Iran deal, litterally just the U.S. being the imperialist here while Iran is trying to handle this peacefully. Tell me where is the U.S. at the short end of the stick in any of these.

&gt;As far as your comment about America once being a beacon of freedom, it very much so still is, yeah yeah yeah we have our problems, that is true wouldn‚Äôt doubt it for a second, but still pound for pound the most free nation in the world, so yeah, we still have that going for us, bill of rights and what not. Feels good!

The U.S. has the highest incarceration rate in the world.

Students start their life with a debt, or else just not study at all and live their life in poverty from start. At least with a loan, they'll slowly descend into poverty.

You litterally only have the choice between 2 parties, slightly better than a 1-party system I admit. A right party and a far right party ... so much for democracy.

The Scandinavian countries and Switzerland (look up Swiss Direct Democracy) easily beats the U.S. when it's about being the most free nation and truest democracy in the World. Easily. After them comes the rest of Western Europe, you because we have the choice between more than 2 parties to govern the state and because regular people actually have the opportunity of being a politician without needing to be a damn millionair.

Sorry to pop you bubble though, but facts are facts.

I felt like the implication that our forefathers came legally did that, but that‚Äôs probably just a knee-jerk reaction on my part.

&gt;There was no law about it at.

There were countless broken treaties throughout westward expansion, and many violations of then-recent humanitarian statutes such as the Spanish [New Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Laws), not to mention murder, which was illegal on both sides.

Additionally, many acts of colonial separatism (the initial establishment of Puritan colonies, the independece of Puerto Rico, the American Revolution) were considered treasonous by the European countries which said colonists came from. 

&gt;[Asylum requirements]

I agree that your description of the requirements of asylum are legally valid, and believe the establishment of such requirements was a great step forward, but it seems that the current administration is hostile to making such ‚Äúcapitulations‚Äù as granting asylum, and I have read that they often do not give asylum seekers a chance to prove themselves.

But I honestly believe fully open border policies would be a more efficient, liberating and humane approach to immigration, and believe that border restrictions‚Äî while sometimes practical under our current arrangement‚Äî do more to restrict everybody‚Äôs freedom of movement than they do to actually promote security.

Yeah I'd say that the Caribbean as a whole is very suboptimal for something like a reactor. That doesn't mean they aren't significantly safer from environmental in extremely stable places (rural New England for example, or the vast majority of central/Western Europe). 


&gt;The earth has precisely zero evolved defenses to protect her biosphere from man made fissile material. 
&gt;
&gt;No.

First off I don't give a shit about ""the earth"", it's a rock, it's the biosphere that matters. As long as waste products are sufficiently isolated, treated, and properly disposed of, it's the least we can do. Even wind turbines and solar panels have harmful wastes associated with their production,but what we're really arguing about here is whether to stick to ""standard"" energy sources vs nuclear until 100% renewable can be achieved. 

The waste generated from some modern generators is pretty small in the grand scheme of things, and I legitimately worry more about the long-term signage (getting people in 10K years to know the risk) more than the environmental impact of something buried absurdly deep in an abandoned mineshaft in an already basically lifeless section of wasteland in the American SW.

Better than having to ship oil around oceans on a boat in the meantime anyway. 



Anyway, Gen IV reactors are still in the weird midpoint between research and planning for implementation, and they're the ones most worth implementing in terms of benefits vs drawbacks. If I had to choose between a new Natural Gas plant by my house or a planned Gen-IV reactor plant I know what I'd go for.

 Finding a remote hole to seal the waste in is difficult, but I sincerely believe that it'll do less harm to the biosphere sealed up at the bottom of a very deep mine shaft in the desert than a normal power plant that spews particulates and actual radioactive isotopes into the air. Seriously, look at the stats for radioactive emissions from ""normal"" gas/oil/coal plants vs nuclear. Until 100% renewable is viable nuclear is far better than gas/oil/coal. And even then there are some arguments to be made that it's less damaging to the biosphere/ecosystems than hydroelectric (aka flooding entire valleys and fucking up everything downstream) or biofuel (aka monoculture so we can make alcohol to burn).",True,False,False,,0,1559410599,,False,0,{},epqqnjx,False,t3_bvkjvp,False,False,t1_epqmdsr,/r/EarthStrike/comments/bvkjvp/how_do_you_feel_about_nuclear/epqqnjx/,False,,1568713837,3,True,[],False,EarthStrike,t5_r5ax8,r/EarthStrike,public,0,

As expected from arabs .

&gt;Also just because their great great grandfathers did something doesn't mean they should be held accountable for it. They weren't even born during that time period and many Arabs resent Western influence. It isn't the fault of the current generation for actions taken by the past. This is a barbaric way of thinking on your part.

Every nation is proud of what they have done doesnt matter if bad or good . In my culture what has your father done through his life affects peoples opinion of you . This means -at least in my culture- you are accountable .

&gt;I just said the Middle East was more stable under the Ottoman Empire. I think you need to take a serious chill pill and relax since this conversation isn't as serious as you think it is.

It really doesnt matter if im relaxed or not . This issue is already been solven . You trying to justify things doesnt change anything now .

&gt;Regardless, it wasn't only Turks ruling the Ottoman Empire; the Ottomans had a very diverse ruling class and complex notable system. The Turkish nationalist myth that the Ottoman Empire was a primarily Turkish endeavor has been debunked several times over the years.

Oh hell no . Ottoman sultans were Turkish and raised by Turkish culture . They still kept Sel√ßuk traditions . And not many padi≈üahs were religious . However the ruling class just like you said were filled people from BALKANS which were taken as children from their homes and raised by Turkish families and converted to islam . 

&gt;And it's not like Arabs waited for a prophet to fix their problems given that they revolted in the first place. If Arabs are anything they certainly aren't compliant.

They are always looking for a easy way out . ALWAYS . Even if it means being an american/russian/french/british puppet.

&gt;Iran isn't Arab and neither is Israel so clearly you don't have the best grasp as to what's going on in the Middle East.

Can agree with ƒ∞ran but they are just shia arabs . But israel has many arab citizens and they control Gaza strip so this makes them some kind of arab country .


&gt;Considering how little Arabs actually fought in the Arab Revolt compared to the thousands who fought for the Ottoman Empire I think that is a huge misconception in it of itself.

Considering how many Turks fought in the war miniatures arabic contrubitions .

&gt;I find it ironic that you criticize Arabs for being too trusting of Europeans and then go on to say that you would rather trust a European than an Arab.

They do good deals when you are smart and not desperate . And they act pragmaticly . They dont do stupid shit which leads them to misery .

&gt;This is why its necessary to understand that not all Arabs participated in the Revolt. The Arabs who did were weak shiekhs like (at the time) the Sauds or Hashemites who were tempted by promises of power from the British. 

Those shieks controlled huge tribes . Not like a only 1 old man did all of it .

Yeah I disagree with that completely. The SPD has been this big for so long because of the historical significance of the working class and worker dynamics. The problem is, these both are changing, rapidly.

For example the Agenda reforms were unpopular, yes, but absolutely necessary because of the nature of the changing labor market. The SPD knows that, too. The problem is that the policies that are necessary and good now and in the future are not social democratic, and social democratic policies may be popular among the traditional SPD electorate but they're simply not good.

&gt;Besides, if anything the Strukturwandel and the new service precariat necessitate a decisively pro-worker party more, even as a collective ""working class"" identity dwindles in importance.

Yeah that's a hard disagree from me.

I remember in something like 2011 I was sitting in a FES presentation with Lars Klingbeil, that was about the changing nature of the labor market and ways to deal with the rise of the gig economy and the increasingly necessary liberal reforms of the extremely rigid german labor market. It was mostly about ideas like a UBI and other ways of having social insurance programs that are flexible and able to deal with people changing jobs every two years.

None of that made it into the parties program or even its rhetoric. Because that's not what the SPD is about. Its whole core is about your work as your identity.

And that is not compatible with the future. The idea of having one job for 40 years is dead. The gig economy is coming, whether we like it or not. People will change jobs every two years.

But the SPDs constituency doesn't want to accept that, and those who do shift over to the Greens, because the Greens are much better prepared to deal with thse developments.

&gt;The FDP is going into a very wrong direction currently, but it has some social liberal seeds in its pro-European and its Young wings that will hopefully blossom over time.

&gt; An explosion at a factory in the Russian city of Dzerzhinsk has left 19 people injured, local media report.

&gt; A factory official says five people were inside at the time of the blast, and they had been safely evacuated.

&gt; A spokesman from the local emergency ministry told Russian news agencies that there was a &amp;quot;Technical explosion&amp;quot; in one of the workshops, which caused a fire of around 100 sq m. Last April three people died in another factory blast in Dzerzhinsk, which is believed to be one of the world&amp;#039;s most polluted cities.

"" One necessary precondition was mass politics. As a mass movement directed against the Left, fascism could not really exist before the citizenry had become involved in politics. Some of the first switches on the tracks leading to fascism were thrown with the first enduring European experiments with manhood suffrage following the revolutions of 1848. 62 Up to that time, both conservatives and liberals had generally tried to limit the electorate to the wealthy and the educated‚Äî‚Äúresponsible‚Äù citizens, capable of choosing among issues of broad principle. After the revolutions of 1848, while most conservatives and cautious liberals were trying to restore limits to the right to vote, a few bold and innovative conservative politicians chose instead to gamble on accepting a mass electorate and trying to manage it ""  


"" Unlike conservatives and cautious liberals, fascists never wanted to keep the masses out of politics. They wanted to enlist, discipline, and energize them. In any event, by the end of World War I, there was no possible turning back to a narrow suffrage. Young men almost everywhere had been summoned to die for their countries, and one could hardly deny the full rights of citizenship to any of them. Women, too, whose economic and social roles the war had expanded enormously, received the vote in many northern European countries (though not yet in France, Italy, Spain, or Switzerland). While fascists sought to restore patriarchy in the family and the workplace, they preferred to mobilize sympathetic women rather than disfranchise them, at least until they could abolish voting altogether ""

Italian serie is also not very comparable to NALCS, there's a very factual and easy to point out, lack of high caliber, NA players. Not only are they lacking as of now, but there's also no showing of a consistent system thats in place to groom any potential talent into better players.

(Meaning NA as a region can't just sit and wait, hope that someone will show up, they have to actively approach and train the talents themselves, because the talent pool isn't big enough.)   

But imports in NALCS are a direct result of lacking firepower, rather than the other way around, that there are star players simply so good, they must take spots. Because a lot of imports aren't even considered star talent when compared to their own region.

You can have profitable markets which aren't healthy (e.g. US healthcare), you can have healthy markets with few competitors (e.g. natural monopolies like airplane construction) and you can have markets with multiple competitors which aren't profitable (e.g. all of those scooter start-ups we're seeing everywhere).

You're creating a false binary choice without backing it up in anyway.

Would you say the energy market (excluding renewables) is currently healthy, competitive and without subsidy? Ignoring the externalities created by CO2 emissions is in effect a subsidy, having 'must run' generators like nuclear isn't a competitive market as you've described. The recent ruling by the EU on the UK capacity market is an example where fossil fuels were seen to be having an unfair advantage over cleaner solutions such as DSR.

As we know, in the event political union was to remain a dream: coups and internal crisis soon pre-occupied their leaders‚Äô energies. But as Peron‚Äôs biographer, Joseph Page\* surmised: ‚ÄúPeron was the only Latin leader willingly to promote union vigorously and he did so until the day he died.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; Peron was trying to do for South America what Mosley was trying to do for Europe. That surely would have been the major topic for discussion at the secret meeting of Peron and Mosley: one on which they would have been in complete accord.
&gt; 
&gt; The two men continued to keep in touch for years to come though it has not been confirmed if they ever met again. But even as I write these words a letter signed by Peron in exile addressed to Mosley‚Äôs office has appeared for sale on the Internet which reads: ‚ÄúI see now we have friends in common whom I greatly value, something which makes me reciprocate even more strongly your expressions of solidarity‚Ä¶I offer my best wishes and a warm embrace.‚Äù -signed Juan Peron, Hotel Pinar, Malaga, Spain, 20 February 1960.
&gt; 
&gt; Oswald Mosley and Juan Peron came from entirely different backgrounds but they shared many core beliefs. They both advocated the ‚ÄòThird Position‚Äô in economics. They both wanted to unite their continents and envisaged that European civilisation, values and culture would undergo a historic renaissance. And although when cornered they would fight like Lions, they would both go to any lengths consistent with honour to avoid bloodshed and war.

I, like everyone else, is barred from any facts by the MEDIA MONOPOLY. 

If I happen to know a fact, but due to widespread propaganda, 99% of the country thinks differently, what good is the fact? 

Suppose it were 1933, and we live in Germany, and I'm trying to tell Germans the ""facts"" about Hitler. What good would that do considering the media in Germany is entirely monopolized by Nazis?

Suppose it were 1500, and we lived in Medieval Europe, and I was trying to tell the ""facts"" about the Plague, or about Heliocentrism. Again, with a virtual media monopoly in place, the ""facts"" fall most on deaf ears, and anyone privy to them is subject to witch-hunt style persecutions. 

&gt; ... turn off the TV and actively seek information ...

I don't watch TV, but why would ""watching TV"" be an issue whatsoever, unless it was propaganda in the first place? Do you think the ""facts"" can overcome propaganda fueled by technology? If so, why hasn't this ever happened before in history?

1. That website has a clear bias and vested interest to actively make shariah look worse. Clearly the Mackenzie institute is probably a pro feminism or the kind of people who say stuff like ""All muslims want shariah and they want to oppress us and they want to make canada into a shariah state"" so take the entire thing with a grain of salt.
2. This institute is a conservative leaning one. If you look at some of its top staff their ex military who have ana active incentive to give a slanted view. They partner with counties like Israel and the USA aswell which further highlights their bias. Even their motto ""protecting Canadian security interests"" I think it was, is a phrase that gives off the vibe that if were writing about you in a negative tone on our website you are not compatible with our nation and our culture.

3. Now that I've debunked that article as a legeimtate source (not once has it quoted the actual Quran or Hadith where the Shariah stems from but instead just giving newspaper reports when sources are even given) let's first talk about college board. Now college board is a corporation that quite simply is left leaning. An example of this is the upcoming adversity score that there adding to the sat which directly challenges the idea of meritocracy and is trying to give less privileged (mostly non whites ) a leg up. This a recurring theme in college board as they attempt to be politically correct. You must have noticed how much they put down White Europeans in History papers continuously pointing out all the atrocities done by the white man against the helpless non white. This to avoid getting sued aswell by some individual belgoning to an minority who feels their being discriminated against if something overtly bad is said about there culture. (This is all just opnion.)

4. If you want to explain the actual historical argument for why were right just comment saying to do that aswell (it includes but not limited to: historical context of the time period, what sharia actually is, how sharia affected a womans positon in court of law and nature of the drawing and other options.

5. Now while writing this I noticed someone saying that they were quite positive that it did say equality, now even IF I am mistaken and you are right my dear sir about this you are mostly likely still wrong about the answer. The nature of sharia law in regards to the court and womans right is a complex topic. I will not delve into exact quotations and examples of how there was an extreme degree of equality and even if there wasn't in any case, (dont trust that article please it's like if the AK party in Turkey wrote an arrival about an segment in the bible √óD) the important thing to remember here is the historical context of the time period and the different interpretations of equality. Simply put, the relative position of Islamic woman under TRUE sharia law comapred to Christian woman in the early medieval era.

[],amitoughenouss,1536038985.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_24tfwz69,False,"I see the a life but I‚Äôm not sure which of you it is for. It‚Äôs a man, he is wearing very torn and raggy clothes but they used to be nice.  It‚Äôs really cold and he is somewhere among sparse trees and possible a frozen lake. The trees are bare and black but the season is just barely beginning to change so the ice on the trees has thawed a bit each day but refrozen at night. Because of this the trees are wet and the little branches are covered in blobby drippy ice that is very clear. He‚Äôs lost. There is a deep sense of regret and disappointment. Like he is a tiny part of something much larger but he feel like all the bad things that have been done to benefit the bigger thing have ultimately been ineffective. I think I see an old musket. And there is something behind him. Not visually but something still and frightening he is tying to get away from. And there is a threatening, almost stingy smell in the air. 
I hear nothing. No birds, no voices. He is just sitting by an attempt at a fire that isn‚Äôt lighting because all the wood is covered in ice. 
There‚Äôs a little metal cup. It‚Äôs a metal I don‚Äôt know. Very dull and silvery in color but darker than stainless steel and when I look at it I can hear his memory of the dead clunk noise it makes when a spoon hits it. Almost a wooden noise. 
I don‚Äôt know what that means. 
His name is something with an A. 
Ambrose I want to say. Or Abarse. I don‚Äôt hear any talking so I don‚Äôt know the language. 
But he has learned something that demoralized him in such a profound way he has decided to just sit there until he dies. I think there are dead bodies behind him. Lots of them. He didn‚Äôt kill them. He walked for days and finally came upon them. All frozen and twisted. Not even animals had eaten them. They have rifles or muskets. I don‚Äôt know what they are. But they don‚Äôt look modern. I  uniforms. They‚Äôre faded blue with pockets on the chest and some have black hats with white on top. 

I see another life too. Again, I don‚Äôt know whose it is because you‚Äôre both in the picture. But I see a woman in a sort of curled bonnet rushing through skinny filthy streets between brown buildings. There is disgusting stuff in the streets. It smells sweet in a rotten way but there is an additional smell, it‚Äôs a choking thick smell of putrefying meat. Her foot slips in a black blob but as she slides on it the black surface breaks and it‚Äôs deep red underneath. It looks like an organ. I think this is behind a butcher shop and she has stepped in discarded offal that has been left there to rot. 
She is running away from someone. No. A few people. They aren‚Äôt actively chasing her but they want her to do something she doesn‚Äôt want to. They expect her to stay in  an unsafe place in a house that is even more unsafe because it is her responsibility. Everyone is dying. It‚Äôs not English I‚Äôm hearing. She is thinking words but I don‚Äôt know them. It‚Äôs a sort of lilting language, almost bouncy and I don‚Äôt hear any sharp noises. No hard j or k sounds. It‚Äôs not a language I directly recognize. 
She thinks she shouldn‚Äôt go that way. That‚Äôs where the first person died. But maybe it‚Äôs safe there now? She doesn‚Äôt know how it works. Just that one person gets sick and then everyone else starts to die. The stink of the town is overwhelming. The air feels sticky. They‚Äôve stopped doing anything with the dead people anymore. She thinks if she can just get to a safer town, further away she will be okay. Somehow she knows she hasn‚Äôt caught it yet. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs plague she is running from. But that‚Äôs not what she calls it. ‚ÄúBayarto‚Äù Maybe? I have a hard time writing out the words I hear in different languages. 
Someone is ill at home. Someone who has always looked after her. But she knows nobody survives so she can‚Äôt do anything to help. 
I see her a few days later. She is out of the bad area except she is starting to feel the disease attack her. She falls against a tree in anguish and says something ‚Äúarayas‚Äù is sounds like. I don‚Äôt know 


I see another life too. Someone is drinking out of a metal cup with chipped paint. The paint is black with white speckles. 
They‚Äôre coming out of a blue tent into damp cool air. The world outside the tent is full of trees that are covered in moss. There‚Äôs mist along the ground and fog high above the trees. They‚Äôre giant redwoods. Someone is missing. It‚Äôs not your person who is missing. You‚Äôre just here to help look. You have begun to think they won‚Äôt be found alive. Someone found blood yesterday. ‚ÄúProbably animal blood‚Äù they reassured a nervous person but you don‚Äôt think so. They shouldn‚Äôt have been out here alone. Don‚Äôt they know it‚Äôs dangerous. 
There‚Äôs a little stream a ways below. You think Beth is down there. The person you‚Äôre looking for is called Beth. The other people looking for her say she wouldn‚Äôt have know there was stream there so wouldn‚Äôt have gone. But you know animals  know the river is there and if she did die some part of her may have been dragged towards the river by an animal. 
Nobody wants to hear your opinion.
You don‚Äôt care. You‚Äôve found people alone before. 
She is down there you can see her. It looks like she fell. She is all broken. You approach and begin talking. You think she is dead. You say out loud, ‚ÄúThis is why we don‚Äôt go wandering around alone in the woods drunk and in high heels now isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù You have to be sarcastic and detached otherwise you‚Äôll think about her family waiting with everyone else at the edge of the woods. 
Her dress is covered in mud. Bright red satin. One shoe heel is broken, so is her leg, so is her other leg. You‚Äôre sure she is dead. It‚Äôs too bad. She is pretty. And only
A little younger than you. If she were alive. If it were allowed. If you wouldn‚Äôt be demonized for feeling that way you could have asked her to dinner. You feel a connection to this pretty girl. 
You begin looking for a foothold to Camilo back up and tell the others you found her but the ground is moist and you slip and bump her slightly. You‚Äôre sure she can‚Äôt be alive, she has been out here for days but she just moved when your shoe hit her. You jump down and lean close to verify, she‚Äôs breathing and makes a little ‚Äúmmm‚Äù noise. 
You yell up that you found her. You‚Äôre screaming that you found her and she is alive but no one can hear you. 
You reassure her that she is going to be okay and that you‚Äôll be right back. 
You run back, making careful note of where you are. You tell her parents and the police. 
She is in the hospital for a long time. She will never walk properly again. But she‚Äôll survive. 
You want to visit her but you know that would be socially inappropriate. 
You keep thinking about the sarcastic comment you made when you thought she was dead. You also keep thinking about how pretty she is and how she makes you want to break rules to be bear her. 
The police person you are friends with tells you she asked to see the person who found her. 
You visit. 
She smiles at you the way you imagine her smiling at a boy. 
She wants to be friends with you. Pretty girls don‚Äôt usually want to be friends with you. Nobody wants to be friends with you because of what people say. They say you‚Äôre too masculine, too ambitious, that a woman should raise a family. You‚Äôve never wanted to raise a family but you would with Beth. You‚Äôre infatuated with her instantly and you think she likes you. 

This is the weirdest thing I‚Äôve ever experienced with one of these visions because I think you‚Äôre both in it. 
I think one of you is Beth and the other is the one who found her. 

I could be getting confused because it‚Äôs two people in one picture and it‚Äôs hard to tell what I‚Äôm seeing. But I don‚Äôt know. Maybe you have known each other in past lives. 

I also see somewhere I‚Äôve never seen before. It could be somewhere between Eastern Europe and Asia? 
The people have wide faces and dark hair and they speak a clumpy language. Full of round vowel sounds and lots of sh ch, and zh noises. I see a little hut and a someone wearing a red yellow and white knitted hat. There is a fire in the middle of the house. And the smoke goes up into the roof and leaks out the sides. It‚Äôs meant to do that. That‚Äôs what keeps something...it‚Äôs a word. I don‚Äôt know the word. ‚ÄúWozh ha‚Äù maybe? But the smoke is what keeps it from eating the roof.  ‚ÄúWozh ha‚Äù are small. Your grandmother stomps on them so I‚Äôm guessing bugs or mice. There is a stone on the fire and a pot on the stone. There are antlers in the corner and a skin drying on the other side of the fire. I see roots in the pot. They are skinny blackish purple roots. i think I‚Äôm seeing through your eyes. (Whichever one of you this is) because I know the roots taste very strong and bitter, but they are good with the meat from the animal with the antlers. The meat is dark red, almost purple. There are many of them outside. Your family raises the animals, eats the meat and drinks their milk. Your father makes hides and carves things out of antlers. You like the milk. It‚Äôs sweet and frothy. Your grandmother makes it sour by leaving it and jugs for the winter. 
You‚Äôre very small. 
You sit on the floor and play with the antlers. You watch your mother and your father‚Äôs mother make the soup, and tend to the animals with antlers. When your father comes home he has ice on his eyelashes. And you like to watch it melt away.

In practice that would not work. There is no realistic way a Maltese candidates can compete with a French, German or Italian candidates when it comes to EU wide publicity. It wouldn't be truly representational, since people wouldn't be equally exposed to candidates from all countries. Electoral districts are meant to balance this kind of skewing which would happen.

I mean, Alexander Stubb tried to be the EPP lead candidate instead of Manfred Weber. Stubb is definitely much more qualified. He has been a prime minister, financial minister, foreign minister and an EU minister. He also has been a MEP, and in addition to being a politician, as a doctor of political science he has an extensive academic career publishing about EU politicis.

But as CDU and Merkel pushed for Weber, he became the lead candidate of EPP, since Weber got much more publicity than Stubb, who is from a small EU country.

With no national borders for elections this effect would increase in EP.

&gt;The European Parliament should represent the people, not the countries. Those are already represented by the councils.

That's like saying EP should represent the people not EU.

In EU elections people can vote wherever they live. German citizen in Sweden can vote a Swedish candidate in Sweden.

All theoretical models are born out of a specific time and place, and built on a set of assumptions. This doesn't mean that theory shouldn't be applied in other contexts, but it does mean that we have to be attentive to the ways that the assumptions of certain frameworks aren't necessarily true when you move them out of a European context. 

For example, there are several studies of Foucauldian biopolitics in China. Biopolitics is a great tool to think with, but it is also built on assumptions about the power of the sovereign in pre-modern France. If you want to use Foucault to talk about China, you need to address the ways in which some elements of biopolitics don't actually work in this context. Another, perhaps better strategy, is to  include the arguments of critical theorists in Asia, whose writings on biopolitics are better attuned to the historical specificities of your study. This doesn't mean cutting out Foucault all together -- one advantage of including him is that it makes your work legible to a lot of other scholars working outside of your field. But the problem of relying on Foucault exclusively often means trying to fit a square peg in a round hole.

* Some gba games look bad on backlight devices, because they were made for the original non-backlight gba-screen.
* To fix this, get a patch from the ""List of the patches"" below and use the [online patcher](https://www.romhacking.net/patch/) patch your rom.
* You can play the patched roms on emulators or on a Game Boy using a flashcard.

# Color restoration patches:

For everyone that is playing on a Game Boy with backlight or with an emulator. I suggest to check out the ""color restoration patches"" to make a lot of GBA games look much better. The picture shows a few differences for some of the games.

# Background info:

The original Game Boy Advance not only had no backlight, but it also was a bad/very dark screen compared to other non backlight displays.Many games were released with brighter colors to accommodate this. But on a backlight screen these colors now often look too bright. Some people took a lot of effort to fix this for some games.

# You will need:

1. The rom file of the game you want to patch (rom-links not allowed here).
2. The color-patch for the game (check the list below).
3. I suggest using the [online patcher](https://www.romhacking.net/patch/):You only have to choose the ""ROM file"", choose the ""Patch file"" and click ""Apply patch"", then you get a download for the patched file.The online patcher supports ips, ups and aps patches and it even can read zip files directly. But if it is ever down you can use an offline program like [Lunar IPS](http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/240/).

# List of the patches:

[Blackthorne](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/3615/)

[Breath of Fire](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/2900/)

[Breath of Fire 2](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/902/)

[Castlevania Harmony of Dissonance](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/677/) (only removes the glowing outlines)

[Donkey Kong Country](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/4051/)

[Final Fantasy VI](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/765/)

[Final Fight One](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/2910/)

[Mother 1](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/2695/)

[SMA4 Super Mario Bros. 3](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/3315/)

[The Lost Vikings](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/3581/)

That is all I found. If you have more, comment and I will add it to the list.

# Why not download the patched rom?

* **Linking roms is not allowed:** Linking to roms is not allowed on many sites (including reddit).So please don't ask for it in the comments.Patching is really easy and normally takes less then a minute of your time. The online patcher should even work from most mobile phones.
* **Don't miss updates:** Some patches could still get updates. Some quite often. But I also have seen patches updated after 10 years of pause. Romhacking updates their entries.This is why I suggest (also for other hacks, translations etc.) to always search for the patch itself instead of a direct download for the patched rom.If you find this thread in your bookmarks or via reddit/google search in some years you have very high chances to still find the newest version of the patch via the links in the list.

# Patched rom doesn't work?

* **Make sure that the patch matches the region of your rom.** Some links contain patches for different regions (E=europe, U=USA, J=japan).Some links may only have a patch for one region; So it is possible that you can only get an english version if only an USA patch is available.
* If it still doesn't work; **Find out the checksum of the game:** There still can be different versions of a rom of the same region.  The entries on romhacking should show the checksum for the needed rom version for CRC32, MD5 and SHA-1.Get a checksum program for one of them and see if  your unpatched rom checksum matches the one, stated in the romhacking entry.The [online patcher](https://www.romhacking.net/patch/) automatically shows you the checksums after uploading the rom.

# Play on real hardware:

The patched games linked here should all run on any modern flashcard for gba. If you have Game Boy with a backlight screen, I suggest getting an ""EZ flash omega"" or an ""Everdrive GBA"".

I you haven't looked into flash cards yet, look at [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gameboy/comments/bmkyig/gba_flash_cart_comparison_everdrive_gba_x5_vs_ez/) for a comparison or search for the two names on r/gameboy.

# My thoughts:

It is a bit sad, that because of the decision of Nintendo, to dont give the forst gba a backlight, still affects us today.Having no backlight for the old Game Boy was the right decision. On the GBC it was questionable.

But imo in 2001 the technology was advanced enough to release a backlight device and still making it not to power hungry or expensive.

Good that some people created patches for some of the games.

Making the patches often is a lot of work. I think there were hundreds of hours spend to create some of the patches. One exception is [SMA4 Super Mario Bros. 3](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/3315/):

&gt;Unlike the other palette hacks for GBA games, where hackers had to put  in the time and dedication to restore the original SNES palettes, Super  Mario Bros. 3 actually already includes the original palette, which is  enabled when playing on a Game Boy Player. This hack simply forces the  GBP palette to be used at all times.

Nearly all the games in the list, are ports of other systems.  I think there are two reasons for that:

* Completely new developed games could use better color combinations for the dark screen, so that you did not need to make everything too bright. Ports on the other hand only could bright everything up and often looked worse. Also if you have something to compare it too, you see it more. So they needed a fix more badly.
* With a port available and with the help of some programs it is a lot easier to create such a patch.

[Castlevania HoD](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/677/) is the only not ported game in the list, so it isn't a restoration patch. The patch here only removes the glowing outlines, which also were implemented because of the dark original GBA screen.

I haven't played all the games in the list, but I think Donkey Kong Country makes the biggest difference. The normal game not only looks to bright. In many places it uses completely different and strange colors.

The author of the DKC1 patch doesn't have the time to make a patch for DKC2 and DKC3, but he might release the tools he made for DKC1, which could help other people, who are interested in doing them.

I didn't initially realize that he was only player *not* on the provisional roster called up, but the point still stands that with his stock rising so much Berhalter may want him in a full MNT to get a look at him for the future. It may be something where the MNT and U23 coaches are deciding on if Yueill will play with one team or both teams in the future.

Berhalter sees this match as more an evaluation of the general player pool whereas the friendly vs Venezuela on the 9th will be the final Gold Cup tuneup. [""The game against Jamaica will represent an opportunity for us to evaluate new prospects as well continue to develop the group for the Gold Cup.

&gt; And what makes this roster not the final roster? 

It's not the final roster because they already have certain players as locks and others are still fighting for a spot. 

&gt; Wasn't JT Marcinkowski on one of the rosters?

JT was called up to a dual MNT/U23s camp that featured players who weren't currently starting with their clubs or had just finished their season in Europe.

&gt; Is he [Yueill] just showing up for the pre-Gold Cup friendly, then heading back to San Jose? 

Yes, as far as I can tell. He basically gets to stay in DC for awhile longer, train with the MNT if not play for them, and then will head back to SJ

Historical linguistics can only go back about  as far as currently accepted proto-languages; so around ~15,000 years, at the top end. There are some disagreements about particular dates and particular families, but you're not going to get anywhere near the time period that language was developing. There are no prominent monogenetic vs. polygenetic theories in historical linguistics because it's outside the scope of the field.

Anthropology can tell us some - not much - about the evolution of linguistic capabilities (e.g. the evolution of the larynx). But this has no connection to the origin of *specific *languages*. Population genetics may be able to tell you more about relationships between populations beyond the time depth that historical linguistics can uncover, but this again doesn't tell you about the languages that those people spoke.

&gt; A local health ministry statement says: &amp;quot;According to the latest information, 79 people asked for medical help after the explosion at Kristall: 38 factory workers and 41 residents of the city. There are no children among the injured.""

&gt; Officials said it was a &amp;quot;Technical explosion&amp;quot; in one of the workshops, which caused a fire of around 100 sq m. Last August three people died in another factory blast in Dzerzhinsk, in central Russia, which is believed to be one of the world&amp;#039;s most polluted cities.

In the first place, there were just Christians in general, but they started arguing over what really counted as real Christianity and some of them split off. Now you have multiple groups who all nominally follow the same religion, but have different names.

The big one was called the Protestant Reformation. At that point, the only major religion in western Europe was Catholicism, but it had gotten super tied in with politics in Italy and corruption was rampant. The big issue that comes into play with this explanation is that the Catholic Church didn‚Äôt like the idea of ordinary people reading the Bible by themselves, and they wanted everyone to just listen to the priests instead. The Protestants encouraged people to study and learn instead of just listening to the priests, who could become corrupt. 

Over time, the name Protestant became less of a religion and more of a term to refer to a variety of sects that originated from that movement. The ideals they started out with changed over time, and specifically the ideal of really studying the Bible to learn the messages fell away, and people have mostly gone back to just listening to the leaders of whichever church they decide really clicks with them. So that gives you a bunch of people who just parrot the vague major concepts and know they don‚Äôt agree with other sects entirely, but don‚Äôt know why. 

Back to the direct topic of sex before marriage, some of those sects believe that the rules laid out in the Bible were written for a specific reason at the time and don‚Äôt always still apply. For example, literally no branches of Christianity still practice stoning, and that was all over the Bible.  Different sects agree with different rules. Pretty much all of them say you should at least try not to have sex before marriage, but not all of them are incredibly serious about it. People break smaller religious rules all the time, and even the bigger ones. (The Ten Commandments are the ones everyone agrees on, and people still can‚Äôt even follow all of them.) 

Regarding different versions of the Bible,  you have to consider the origins of it- a series of books written in languages that are no longer actively spoken. Translation is more of an art than a science, so you can get a lot of different results from different translators. They all follow the overall story, so most people don‚Äôt get too up in arms over which translation to use outside of academic contexts.

One of the first points he made repeatedly early on was that Marx hijacked the term and redefined it to mean ""worker/collective ownership of the means of production."" He refers to this concept over and over again as Jewry. And that Marx was a Jew who was incapable of understanding socialism in a nationalist context because Jews (at that time) didn't have a homeland.

Socialism as the Agrarian Aryan society was the ideal of Hitler and the Nazis. So Socialism in the long-term sense was an Agrarian society built by Aryans. But Socialism in the immediate sense (the 1930's) also meant devotion to the current German/Aryan Community.

Nazi Law theorist Gottfried Neesse defined it this way.

""The nation is the complete agreement between organism and organization, the perfect formation of a naturally grown being. ... Nationalism is nothing more than the outwardly directed striving to maintain this inner unity of people and state, and socialism is the inwardly directed striving for the same end.""

Hitler's short-term goal was to mobilize German industry to re-arm Germany and prepare for  the conquest of Eastern Europe for farmlands and living space. He gave the German Capitalists plenty of incentives to support his plans (including bribery). He even purged the SA and Ernst Rohm (who advocated worker ownership of the means of production).

So during the war period, Socialism generally meant total devotion and sacrifice of a German individual to the cause of the German community. When, after they purged the Jews, cultivated Eastern Europe, and established their Agrarian society, they would then achieve their ideal Socialist system.

According to their racial theories, Jewish influence in German capitalism and influence in labor unions is what lead to exploitation and class warfare.

The Madagascar Plan was a proposal by the Nazi German government to relocate the Jewish population of Europe to the island of Madagascar. Franz Rademacher, head of the Jewish Department of the German Foreign Office, proposed the idea in June 1940, shortly before the Fall of France. The proposal called for the handing over of control of Madagascar, then a French colony, to Germany as part of the French surrender terms.

The idea of re-settling Polish Jews in Madagascar was investigated by the Polish government in 1937, but the task force sent to evaluate the island's potential determined that only 5,000 to 7,000 families could be accommodated, or even as few as 500 families by some estimates.

After nearly a year of work, we've finally got a relatively playable version of the dev branch! Here's a list of some of the new features and content:Happiness mechanic - As your colony grows from a quiet farming village to a bustling city, their demands increase. Feed them well and give them luxury items to keep them happy. Or don't, and watch your science speed &amp; productivity plummet while recruitment costs dramatically rise. Co-op - It's now possible to share a colony with friends! Dozens and dozens of new items and jobs - fishermen, cooks, diamonds, tea, coffee, silk, and last but not least, potatoes! Entirely new world generation - It uses a combination of temperature and ""rainfall"" (not visible, but a lush forest obviously has more rainfall than a desert) to determine what the area should look like.Three exotic regions - There's now a Far East, Tropics and New World, each with their own unique science, jobs and research!Multiple colonies mechanic - Craft a Colony Starter Kit and start new colonies. Glider - Research and craft a glider and take to the skies for rapid exploration and travel!Trading - Set up traders to sent items and science from one colony to another, or to other players in multiplayer. New Unity Version - Includes a multitude of updates which solve common problems Dramatic optimization - Terrain should load a lot quicker, and you ought to be able to have a lot of extra colonists!New save system - Savegames are 10 times smaller, making saving and loading 10 times as quick. They're also 10 times less likely to corrupt! It's also prepared to deal with the Steam Workshop.Easy co-op hosting - It's no longer necessary to browse through the installation folder and find a separate server. Set up a multiplayer server with friends right from the main menu! LAN support - By popular demand. Plenty of other small optimizations - You can now recruit as many colonists as you've got unfilled jobs or beds in one click, or enter a custom number. A lot of old and ugly hand drawn icons have been replaced with rendered icons. Some job blocks have been replaced as well. This is the most dramatic overhaul Colony Survival has ever had. 0.6.3 was highly polished and balanced - 0.7.0 is not like that. You should be able to have many hours of fun with the beta, but you will run into errors, missing content, highly unbalanced recipes and unfinished elements. But if you understand that and are still looking forward to testing 0.7.0 and sharing your experiences with us, we'd love to have you on board! We're planning to keep the Open Beta live until the definitive release of 0.7.0. Make yourself invaluable by sharing good and detailed feedback, and you'll be invited to future internal testing as well. Join the open beta by going to #introductions in our Discord and typing something like the following sentence with the appropriate info: ""@Developer @Admin I'm from , I'm  and have played CS for  and I'd like to help!""So it would look something like: ""@Developer @Admin I'm from Australia, I'm in my 20s and have played CS for 32 hours and I'd like to help!""""@Developer @Admin I'm from Europe, I'm 19 and have played CS for 12 hours and I'd like to help!""We'll check #introductions often and grant the Open Beta Tester role to anyone who posts the sentence there correctly. With the OB Tester role, you've got access to the Perpetual Testing Initiative category on Discord. Read #test-announcements to read how to get access to the 0.7.0-branch. You need to own the game on Steam to unlock it! We're all based in Europe, so there might be a gap in verifications somewhere between midnight and 9AM CET. We hope you'll try all the new features and report back about your experience. Screenshots and videos are welcome. You're allowed to share videos outside of the Discord, but we'd appreciate it if you make clear that it's a highly unfinished beta. Good luck testing and bedankt voor het lezen! Reddit // Twitter // YouTube // Website // Discord

&gt; Nine Inch Nails is an Industrial rock band that was formed in 1988 in Cleveland, Ohio, United States by Trent Reznor, the only constant member of the band. Reznor is generally credited for popularizing the genre known as ""industrial rock"" with both his releases and dark, theatrical music videos. As of 2016, the band also officially includes Reznor's longtime collaborator Atticus Ross as a second official member.

&gt; Born Michael Trent Reznor, he was raised by his maternal grandparents in Mercer, Pennsylvania, USA. Reznor took up piano at the age of five and in high school took up the tuba and saxophone. In the early to mid-80s, Trent played with various synthpop and new wave groups such as Exotic Birds and Option 30 before beginning his solo project. 

&gt; As a member of Exotic Birds, he appeared in the Michael J. Fox and Joan Jett  film Light of Day. He also was mentioned on local TV as a proponent of electronic music in general. Before the 1989 release of NIN's first album, 'Pretty Hate Machine', he worked for Right Track Studio as a handyman heavily interested in recording technology. Both the name of Reznor's band and the title of his second single, ""Head Like a Hole"", came from remarks by Al Jourgensen of Ministry, Reznor's biggest influence.

&gt; Nine Inch Nails has issued eight major albums, which have generally received both critical and commercial acclaim. Historically, NIN releases have been assigned a ""Halo"" index number. For example, the album 'With Teeth' is also known as Halo 19. With the inclusion of the 'Broken' EP, the band's primary releases are:

&gt; 1. 'Pretty Hate Machine' (1989)
2. 'Broken' EP (1992)
3. 'The Downward Spiral' (1994)
4. 'The Fragile (Left)' / ''The Fragile (Right)' (1999)
5. 'With Teeth' (2005)
6. 'Year Zero' (2007)
7. 'Ghosts I-IV' (2008)
8. 'The Slip' (2008)
9. 'Hesitation Marks' (2013)
10. 'Not the Actual Events' EP (2016)
11. 'Add Violence' EP (2017)
12. 'Bad Witch'  (2018)

&gt; Nine Inch Nails has also produced a number of EP's, remixes, and provided contributions to various movie soundtracks, including 'Lara Croft: Tomb Raider', 'The Crow', 'Natural Born Killers', 'Lost Highway', and 'Tetsuo: The Bullet Man'. Trent Reznor additionally provided the soundtrack for the massively popular id Software game Quake, a release inspired by ambient music. His team up with Atticus Ross resulted in the critically praised soundtrack to the film 'The Social Network', with the Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross duo winning an Oscar for Best Original Score at the 83rd Academy Awards

&gt; In 2002, a live album (their second live release, the first being the video 'Closure Documentary') entitled 'And All That Could Have Been' was released on DVD &amp; CD. The Deluxe version of the CD came packaged with a mini album called 'Still'. That release featured several previously released songs in a stripped down, near-acoustic format along with several other new compositions.

&gt; Nine Inch Nails as a live band is generally understood to be a separate entity from its recording studio-based component. Occasionally, past band members are invited to participate in the process when not directly involved with recording new material, Nine Inch Nails' lineup tends to change drastically between major tours. Aside from Trent Reznor remaining on lead vocals, nothing about the live band has remained constant since its inception. Reznor cited the long gestation period between studio albums as part of the reason for these frequent personnel changes.

&gt; Beginning in late 2005, the live band featured Aaron North on guitar, Jeordie White on bass guitar, Alessandro Cortini on keyboards, and Josh Freese on drums, though all occasionally performed with different instruments. This lineup toured Europe, Asia, Australia, and America through 2007. Trent Reznor reported that he would disband the ""rock band configuration"" of his touring lineup after their concert in Honolulu, Hawaii on September 18, 2007, and would explore other means to perform Nine Inch Nails material on subsequent tours. Despite this claim he has regained the rock group lineup for the 'Lights In The Sky Over...' tours with Robin Finck returning on guitar and Justin Meldal-Johnsen of Beck and other projects accompanying Cortini and Freese.

&gt; Past live band members include (listed chronologically):

&gt; * Ron Musarra: Drums, Samplers
* Chris Vrenna: Keyboards, Samplers, Drums
* Richard Patrick: Guitar
* Jeff Ward: Drums
* David Haymes: Keyboards
* Nick Rushe: Keyboards
* Lee Mars: Keyboards
* James Woolley: Keyboards
* Robin Finck: Guitar, Synthesizer
* Danny Lohner: Bass, Guitar, Synthesizer
* Charlie Clouser: Synthesizer, Drums on 5 songs during the Dissonance side of David Bowie's Outside tour, Theremin
* Sean Beavan: Soundboard, Backing vocals on 5 songs
* Jerome Dillon: Drums
* Alex Carapetis: Drums
* Ilan Rubin: Drums

&gt; The September 14, 2007 edition of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin reported that the September 18 show in Honolulu, Hawaii would be the last performance of the current incarnation of the Nine Inch Nails live band. Trent Reznor was quoted as stating, ""at this point, I want to switch things around a bit. Nine Inch Nails as a rock band configuration, we've done it and we've done it again. I see other ways I can present the material in concert, more challenging, something new. I don't want it to go stale.""

&gt; A DVD/Blu-Ray/HD-DVD of live material from the 2006 With Teeth tour was released in late February 2007 entitled Nine Inch Nails Live: Beside You In Time. All three formats include 24 songs from the summer and winter 2006 tours, plus bonus material.

&gt; Information about Nine Inch Nails concerts can be found on the NIN website.

&gt; Ghosts I-IV was released on March 2, 2008. It contains 36 instrumental tracks and was recorded in ten weeks of fall 2007. Initially intended to be a five-track EP, the album is presented in the form of four nine-track EPs. The tracks do not have names, and are only identified by their track listing and position on the EPs.  Ghosts I-IV also adds to the recent experimentation with digital distribution; the album is available in many different ways, including a digital download, for purchase or (partially) free, a CD set, and a deluxe edition set.

&gt; The eighth album called ""The Slip"" was officially released on May 5, 2008. The whole album can be downloaded for free from this website: Nine Inch Nails - The Slip

&gt; On February 16th 2009, Trent announced that he would begin his last tour. Nine Inch Nails would indefinitely end. However, it is not likely that this is the end of his music career. In his letter, he hinted that he may do something with Jane's Addiction. In addition, Reznor has said outright in an interview on the official website that he is not done making music as Nine Inch Nails, but that he is done touring.

&gt; Trivia:
 * Trent Reznor has worked with several big names in musical collaboration outside of NIN in recent years, including time rocker artist David Bowie, Maynard James Keenan of Tool, Zach de La Rocha of Rage Against the Machine, Peter Murphy of Bauhaus, Josh Wink, Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, slam poet Saul Williams, hip-hop producer Puff Daddy &amp; The Family, Peter Gabriel, Henry Rollins and more recently, hip-hop producer El-P and Queens of the Stone Age.
 * Contrary to popular belief, Suck is technically a cover and not an original. The song was originally performed by the band Pigface on the album Gub (1991), a band which Trent worked with in the past. Trent is given vocal and writing credits and the song was later re-recorded for the Broken EP (1992) as a hidden track .
 * Legendary country star Johnny Cash covered Hurt on the album The Man Comes Around.

&gt; Richard Hawley (born Richard Willis Hawley, 17 January 1967, Sheffield, United Kingdom) is a critically-acclaimed guitarist, singer, songwriter and producer. Hawley initially found success as a member of Britpop band Longpigs in the 1990's, and formerly Treebound Story. When a drug-filled torpor after an extensive tour of America brought the band to the brink of extinction in 1997, Hawley was asked to play with Pulp by his close friend and Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker. ""They saved my life,"" Hawley later recalled, ""I was going mental with drink and drugs."" The subsequent world tour in support of Pulp's album This Is Hardcore left Hawley emotionally and physically drained on his return to his home city. During this time, he even considered leaving the music industry altogether.

&gt; It was an encounter at Hawley's Sheffield home that led the longtime collaborator out of the shadows. Impressed by a home demo of his songs, both Pulp's Jarvis Cocker and Steve Mackey urged Hawley to head into the studio and begin work on his first solo release. 2000's eponymous mini album encouraged Hawley to return to the studio once more. In 2001 Late Night Final, named after the cry of vendors selling the Sheffield Star evening newspaper on the streets of the city, was released to positive reviews from the press, if unspectacular sales. Two years later Hawley released Lowedges, another Sheffield reference, this time to the curiously named suburb of the city that had so entranced the young Hawley when he had seen it on the destination board of a bus. NME called Lowedges the ""first great album of 2003"" and it topped an end of year poll held by Virgin Radio.

&gt; In 2004 Hawley signed to Mute Records, a division of the giant EMI. Legal wrangling delayed Cole's Corner, Hawley's fourth release, until September 2005. Again Hawley mines the theme of his beloved home city, this time referencing the location where courting lovers meet. Cole's Corner eventually gained a nomination for the acclaimed Mercury Prize in 2006.

&gt; Hawley's work as a session musician and producer remains in high demand. After contributing towards her eponymous 2004 release, Hawley also supported Nancy Sinatra on her European tour in 2005. In the past, Hawley has also worked with artists as diverse as New York's A Girl Called Eddy, All Saints (he played the guitar solo on their cover of ""Under the Bridge""), Nellee Hooper's soundtrack for Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet and with Jarvis Cocker's Relaxed Muscle project.

&gt; Aside from his solo and session work, Hawley occasionally tours with The Feral Cats, a side project that enables him to explore his interest in rockabilly music.

&gt; Possibly due to his aforementioned rockabilly interest, Hawley once auditioned for the role as guitarist in the rockabilly-inclined Morrissey's band.

&gt; Fiercely proud of his working class upbringing, Hawley recently described himself as ""jurassic labour"" in response to a question about the New Labour project. He lives in Sheffield, with his wife and children and is an avid Sheffield Wednesday supporter.

&gt; In 2007 Hawley released a new studio album, Lady's Bridge (the title refers to a bridge Hawley regulary crosses in his native Sheffield) again to much critical acclaim.

&gt; Hawley's album Truelove's Gutter was released in September 2009 and followed that October by a UK nationwide tour. The album was nominated for, and won the Mojo record of the year.

&gt; Following the success of his award-winning, hugely acclaimed 2009 album 'Truelove's Gutter', Richard Hawley will release his sixth studio album, 'Standing At The Sky's Edge' - his first for new label Parlophone - on 7th May.

&gt; Recorded at Sheffield's Yellow Arch Studio in 2011, 'Standing At The Sky's Edge' marks a seismic shift in direction for Hawley. The album is a euphoric, sonic assault on the senses, channelling elements of psychedelia, space rock and ragas with heavy riffs and raw, visceral guitar solos - as well as more familiar, tender moments - which will surprise Hawley's fans and peers alike.

As for the equipment, weapons and such, we happily accept and not only would like to have military stability in such form but also ask for other things.

Such of which, we hope to formalize in a meeting with President Kalo and President Ocasio-Cortez but we will make our talking points clear here.

* Economic Advisors

Our economy is plummeting. Our public sector is diminished and our unemployment is one of the highest in the region, if not for one of the top-10 of Europe. We would like more insight and assistance from the United States in order to maintain capitalist, free-market trade and similar that will help corporations and small businesses finally flollack and grow in Kosovo.

* Military and Police Advisors 

As you stated here, we need training beyond what we currently have. The most effective tactics we historically have excelled are guerilla warfare against an enemy. Our weapon there was more the people than terrain. We would like to better ourselves, our police and military tactically and ethically. 

We also seek more DEA and FBI assistance in the country to help our ever-growing police force (the AZD, based heavily off the organization of the American DEA) in arming them in the ever-growing fight against smuggling and trafficking from human to drug.

* Political Advisors

We are always searching for ways to better ourselves, in search and pursuit of a more Perfect Union. We, since 2013, have been in locked in a situation with the situation agreed by the EU of Serb Municipalities and allowing the Serbian people in Kosovo some autonomy to govern themselves. However, this has come at some critique where majority Serbian-lands would be governing a minority Albanian and the same for majority Albanian-lands governing a minority Serbian. 

Both sides have stated it would be unfair and poorly representated. We listened. We feel the strongest and best decision is to reform the government entirely and seek a more perfect union in the form of a Federation of Kosovo, allowing all regions a portion of self-governance but also granting more power Federally in order to contain the threat of poor representative of minorities within certain regions. We are also not throwing out the idea of a Confederation but feel a Federation would be the best idea for both a solid set of separation and integration.

 Criadas pela Constitui√ß√£o de 1988 em substitui√ß√£o aos decretos-lei da ditadura, as MPs s√£o o principal instrumento do governo para legislar. Elas t√™m for√ßa de lei, mas precisam ser aprovadas em at√© 120 dias pelo Congresso para virarem, de fato, uma lei.

 As MPs s√£o fonte constante de cr√≠ticas de congressistas porque n√£o h√° limite ao seu uso pelo presidente, ocupam parte relevante da agenda do Congresso e, em alguns casos, n√£o atendem aos crit√©rios de relev√¢ncia e urg√™ncia exigidos pela Constitui√ß√£o.

 A tentativa de restringir o mecanismo conta com o aval de parte da c√∫pula da C√¢mara e do Senado e √© tratada em duas frentes.

 A mais importante delas est√° no Senado.

 No in√≠cio de abril foi apresentada uma proposta de emenda √† Constitui√ß√£o (PEC 43/2019), de autoria dos senadores Randolfe Rodrigues (Rede-AP) e Antonio Anastasia (PSDB-MG), que conta com a assinatura de 28 dos 81 integrantes da Casa.

 Ela est√° em an√°lise pela Comiss√£o de Constitui√ß√£o e Justi√ßa do Senado, que √© o primeiro passo da tramita√ß√£o, e estabelece regras dur√≠ssimas para o uso das medidas provis√≥rias.

 S√≥ cinco poderiam ser editadas pelo presidente a cada ano, e n√£o seria permitido que abordassem temas j√° tratados em projetos em tramita√ß√£o no Congresso.

 Uma das inten√ß√µes dos defensores da medida √© for√ßar o Pal√°cio do Planalto a conduzir suas propostas por meio de projetos de lei, que s√≥ passam a vigorar depois de cumprir toda a tramita√ß√£o no Congresso e serem sancionadas pelo presidente, ou encampar propostas de parlamentares j√° em tramita√ß√£o.

 Hoje n√£o h√° limite para a edi√ß√£o de MPs. S√≥ nos seus primeiros meses de mandato, Bolsonaro editou 14 medidas provis√≥rias. O n√∫mero √© menor do que o de Michel Temer (MDB) em igual per√≠odo de sua gest√£o (23), mas supera os de Dilma Rousseff (PT) nos cinco primeiros meses de seus dois mandatos --13 e 9, respectivamente.

 Sem uma base formal de apoio no Congresso, Bolsonaro tem encontrado dificuldade em fazer valer suas propostas.

 Na semana que passou, o governo conseguiu aprovar no Congresso a [MP que reduziu o n√∫mero de minist√©rios](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/05/senado-aprova-texto-base-de-mp-de-bolsonaro-situacao-do-coaf-ainda-e-discutida.shtml), mas perto do prazo de 120 dias e com altera√ß√µes, como a retirada do Coaf (Conselho de Controle de Atividades Financeiras) da al√ßada do Minist√©rio da Justi√ßa de Sergio Moro ‚Äîo √≥rg√£o fiscalizador voltou para a pasta da Economia.

 Randolfe diz que apresentou a proposta de emenda √† Constitui√ß√£o ap√≥s entendimentos com o presidente do Senado, Davi Alcolumbre (DEM-AP), de quem √© aliado.

 ""Eu apresentei a PEC ap√≥s di√°logo com o presidente do Senado e com outros l√≠deres. Tasso [Jereissati, do PSDB], Anastasia... N√£o conversei com o Maia [Rodrigo Maia (DEM-RJ), presidente da C√¢mara], mas sei que existe simpatia na C√¢mara, inclusive do presidente Maia"", afirma Randolfe.

 De fato, a **Folha** ouviu de v√°rios deputados federais a afirma√ß√£o de que o tema √© uma de suas prioridades em 2019.

 Al√©m das tradicionais cr√≠ticas ao uso indiscriminado de MPs, v√°rios partidos querem dar uma resposta a Bolsonaro, que desde a transi√ß√£o tem estimulado um discurso considerado por esses parlamentares como de [criminaliza√ß√£o da tradicional atividade pol√≠tica](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/03/bolsonaro-diz-que-atritos-com-congresso-existem-porque-alguns-nao-querem-largar-a-velha-politica.shtml).

 Com base em conversas com empres√°rios e representantes do mercado, esses congressistas t√™m avaliado que o governo n√£o reuniu at√© agora capacidade real de governabilidade e que, nesse momento pelo menos, cabe ao Congresso tomar as r√©deas.

 Devido a isso, C√¢mara e Senado adotam uma esp√©cie de parlamentarismo branco, assumindo a linha de frente das reformas da Previd√™ncia e tribut√°ria, entre outras a√ß√µes.

 Apesar do clima favor√°vel, o texto que restringe as MPs deve sofrer oposi√ß√£o e provavelmente ser√° modificado.

 Relator da PEC na CCJ, o senador Esperidi√£o Amin (PP-SC) diz n√£o ter posi√ß√£o ainda sobre a ideia. Para ele, o principal problema das MPs √© o Congresso, n√£o o instrumento.

 ""Eu sou autor do texto que est√° em vigor. A Emenda Constitucional 32 [que proibiu a reedi√ß√£o indefinida de MPs n√£o analisadas], de 2001, √© proposta minha, copiando modelo de Santa Catarina. A pr√°tica de reeditar √© muito pior do que √© hoje. Hoje a culpa √© do Congresso, culpa nossa, porque a C√¢mara ret√©m [demora a votar as MPs e d√° pouco tempo de an√°lise ao Senado]"", diz Amin.

 Ele afirma que apresentar√° um relat√≥rio em tempo menor do que a C√¢mara gasta para votar uma MP. ""N√£o analisei, mas n√£o tenho nenhuma disposi√ß√£o a favor disso, a MP √© um instrumento regulado pela Constitui√ß√£o. Ainda n√£o tenho posi√ß√£o, mas n√£o tenho boa vontade"", afirma.

 Cabe a Amin apresentar um relat√≥rio que ser√° aprovado ou rejeitado pela CCJ, composta de 27 senadores titulares ‚Äî11 deles signat√°rios da PEC.

 A outra frente para modificar as regras de tramita√ß√£o das MPs est√° na C√¢mara, em outra PEC, a 70/2011.

 De autoria do ex-presidente da Rep√∫blica Jos√© Sarney (1985-1990), a proposta j√° foi aprovada no Senado e nas comiss√µes da C√¢mara, estando pronta para ser votada no plen√°rio. Ela, inclusive, esteve na pauta de vota√ß√µes da √∫ltima ter√ßa-feira, mas acabou n√£o sendo analisada.

 O texto tem como um dos objetivos estabelecer mecanismos para assegurar que o Senado tenha mais tempo para analisar as MPs ‚Äîhoje √© comum a C√¢mara esgotar praticamente todo o tempo de 120 dias de an√°lise e[ enviar as medidas para o Senado no limite do prazo.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/05/senado-nao-pode-ser-casa-carimbadora-diz-davi-alcolumbre-no-rs.shtml)

 De 1988 at√© 2001, o poder das medidas provis√≥rias era mais elevado. Elas podiam ser reeditadas sucessivamente caso n√£o tivessem sido analisadas pelo Congresso.

 Com a Emenda Constitucional 32, estabeleceu-se o prazo de at√© 120 dias para vota√ß√£o por deputados e senadores, per√≠odo ap√≥s o qual a MP perde a validade se n√£o tiver sido aprovada. A emenda tamb√©m proibiu a edi√ß√£o de MPs para temas como direito penal e processual civil, entre outros.

 Em 2009 a C√¢mara passou a adotar uma interpreta√ß√£o do ent√£o presidente da Casa, Michel Temer, que afrouxou a camisa de for√ßa no plen√°rio, que era impedido de votar outros temas caso houvesse MPs com o prazo m√≠nimo de an√°lise estourado --o chamado ""trancamento de pauta"", no jarg√£o legislativo.

 A partir de ent√£o, a Casa passou a entender ser v√°lida a vota√ß√£o, nessas situa√ß√µes, de projetos que n√£o poderiam ser objeto de MPs, como emendas √† Constitui√ß√£o.

  ### Entenda a quest√£o das MPs

 **O que √© uma medida provis√≥ria (MP)**

  * Principal instrumento que o governo federal tem para legislar, foi institu√≠da pela Constitui√ß√£o de 1988, em substitui√ß√£o aos decretos-lei da ditadura
 * S√≥ pode ser usada em casos de urg√™ncia e relev√¢ncia, mas o Executivo normalmente ignora essa exig√™ncia
 * Tem for√ßa de lei a partir de sua edi√ß√£o
 * Deve ser votada pelo Congresso, que pode modific√°-la, em at√© 120 dias. Caso contr√°rio, caduca
  **MPs editadas nos cinco primeiros meses de mandato presidencial**

  * Collor (1990-1992): 36
 * Itamar (1192-1994): 4
 * FHC 1 (1995-1998): 47
 * FHC 2 (1999-2002): 1
 * Lula 1 (2003-2006): 17
 * Lula 2 (2007-2010): 32
 * Dilma 1 (2011-2014): 13
 * Dilma 2 (2015-2016): 9
 * Temer (2016-2018): 23
 * Bolsonaro (2019 - ): 14
  **Bolsonaro j√° editou...**  
 mais MPs que Dilma no in√≠cio dos seus dois mandatos, mas menos que Lula e Temer

 **Emenda √† Constitui√ß√£o em 2001**  
 Estabeleceu prazo de an√°lise de 120 dias pelo Congresso e proibiu a reedi√ß√£o, no mesmo ano, de MPs rejeitadas ou que tenham caducado. Tamb√©m vedou a edi√ß√£o de MPs para temas como direito penal e processual civil 

 **O que prop√µe o projeto no Senado**

  * Limite de 5 MPs por ano
 * Veto √† edi√ß√£o de MPs sobre direito trabalhista
 * Veto √† edi√ß√£o de MPs para projetos de lei em tramita√ß√£o no Congresso
 * Perda da efic√°cia para MPs que n√£o sejam votadas em at√© 60 dias",True,False,False,,0,1559458963,,False,0,{},epspg5n,True,t3_bvut74,False,True,t3_bvut74,/r/brasilnoticias/comments/bvut74/proposta_quer_limitar_medidas_provis√≥rias/epspg5n/,False,,1568747267,1,True,[],False,brasilnoticias,t5_3a1qf,r/brasilnoticias,restricted,0,

1: Learn to play the weapons you lose against most. By doing this, you'll learn how those weapons are beaten, and areas they can't cover. Brawlhalla is fast-paced, so you'll have to 'feel' it, instead of just knowing it.

2: Learn fringe tech. By doing this, you'll get better control over your characters, by improving your input accuracy, thus allowing for better play. If you want any examples, just ask.

3: Learn to use 'general reads'. This means reading your opponent by thinking how most people react to certain moves. If, for example, you realise most people dodge in against scythe, you can just use that the first time you land a combo starter, leading to free damage. In plat, most people will switch up their dodging a bit, but eventually fall back into the same patterns. If you can figure those patterns out, you'll be good.

He's spot on to talk about power... and this is where I think there's an issue. A lot of people who voted to leave, feel a loss of power and this comes from many areas - competing in an EU not just British job market, industries now being optimally located within the EU not just British industry market so we see a general shift away from industry towards services, then there are cultural shifts where there is increased diversity and more variety could be perceived as a watering down/weakening of identity, and it involves influence of ideas and legislation in order to co-operate across the EU which again could be perceived as a loss of power.

&amp;#x200B;

So, then people who voted to remain, perhaps they are more likely to perceive these exact same things as a gain in power or maintenance of power into the changing future. This is why we get this impression of people viewing the same thing but coming up with two different realities. If we view it as 'leave = perception of a loss of power' and 'remain = perception of a gain in power' - I think this can help us feel more compassionate towards both sides. People generally get angry as part of the fight/flight response - so there's an anxiety or a loss or an attack being perceived and a general feeling of a loss of power would definitely explain the resulting hostility. blah blah... really interesting video.

2.  The British monopoly goes back to the early 16th century with Spanish and Portuguese dominating the trade with Asia they left Northern New Canaan alone as they thought it was too poor and Central/Southern New Canaan too difficult to profit from (minus the Colorado Culture who the Spanish discovered).   The British were eventually able to squeeze out other competition in New Canaan such as the Dutch, French, Danish and Scots (although with the Scots they formed a joint overseas sort of thing).  So by the 19th century the British dominated New Canaan even if they didn't officially control all the territory.  

3.  Interesting question.  The fundamental interactions between humans and modernus is more akin to two predators of different species meeting each other, that is to say avoidance.   After all they are two different species which can't easily communicate with each other despite being at the same intelligence level.    Violence usually occurs when they are backed into a corner with nowhere to go.
In the case of the Colorado Culture attacking British settlers that is actually the decision makers of the Colorado Culture believing themselves to be backed into a corner.  Unlike many modernus the elites of the Colorado Culture are aware of how much territory humans have and they have a rough idea of how many humans there are.  Additionally it is political advantageous for Colorado to support modernus groups who are near British settlers as it allows them to try and induct them into the Colorado Culture and fulfills the religious mandate of the elites.

What's wrong with wishing for a quiet life surrounded by your community,  your society and the familiarity that it all brings.

Politicians endlessly tell us about all the economic benefits of mass migration and multiculturalism, but who really feels that benefit? It's only the business owners, the already wealthy, the politicians and the elite that gain from such things. I'm sure it's wonderful for people with lots of disposable income to be able to have cheaper house keepers, have their car washed by near slave labour every week, to get an au pair for their children, to have an accented Barista serve them overpriced coffee, to have a poor zero-hours worker deliver their overpriced takeaway meal or to take yet another uber to the theatre, driven by someone who's knowledge of the UK road &amp; traffic laws leaves a lot to be desired.

The majority of people barely feel all these wonderful benefits and that's before you talk about all the issues with crime, jobs, downward pressure on wages, overburdened schools, a healthcare system struggling under the weight of all these people and much more.

Leaving the EU was about more than just the above, but this kind of thing is a key part of it. Most people just want a quiet life where they can live and work, raise their family and enjoy some of the luxuries we have been blessed with, to feel safe and comfortable in their communities. Most recognise that a vote to leave the EU isn't a one-size-fits-all solution that will solve all their ills, but they do see that it is probably the best step they can take to tell the powers that be that there are major issues which need resolving and they do not feel listened to.

All you have to do is drive out of Lagos or Abuja and you‚Äôll see how dirt poor and underdeveloped the country is. Being swarmed by 20 street children asking for ‚Äúchop‚Äù (food) in Kaduna was an eye opening experience.

    Author: obtrae Body: Ey, let's all agree that there are a few nice looking places in Africa, but there's still a shit ton of work that still needs to be done. As a South African, I can confirm that there's a lot of messed up places.

To view it in military terms, in terms of its effects upon the stability of the Middle East, its effects upon the people of Iraq, or in terms of domestic British politics, is a profound mistake. By all all of those metrics, it was a disaster, and I am sure that Tony Blair had a pretty good idea that this would be the case in advance. 

However, given that the UK sits on the edge of Europe (evidenced during the Blair years by reluctance to join the Euro), it remained and remains vital for us to maintain a child seat at the Americans' table as an insurance policy. Indeed, Brexit demonstrates the wisdom of such a policy (I have not attempted to calculate the cost of our American wars, but it is probably not smaller than the nett cost of EU membership). 

Unfortunately, the political direction of the USA is not really compatible with that of the UK. The Americans are currently in the process of re-evaluating their national interest, and although a hypothetical Prime Minister Boris ""Fuck Business"" Johnson would perhaps get on reasonably well with Donald Trump, we are less able than the Americans to afford the cost of protectionist policies inimical to trade, especially given that we desire to maintain public spending to fund such institutions as the NHS.

Ultimately, I think that we need to stay with the EU because American interests are most likely to favour breaking up the NHS, removing workers' rights, and deregulating our industries to the disbenefit of us all.

&gt; Additionally, the economic impact is lower using an ETS. This is because emissions abatement does not cost the same across each sector. Just have a look at marginal abatement cost curves. Since the cost is different across sectors, the sectors where it is cheaper can abate by more and sell the credits to another sector. Therefore, the economic impact is lower under an ETS.

A Pigouvian carbon tax allows for different MAC curves across sectors, emitters. Like in an ETS where emitters with low MAC will sell their permits up until it is no longer profitable, a firm under a carbon tax will abate up until the point where abatement would cost the same as paying the tax. The static outcome looks the same for an ETS and a tax, where MAC is equalized among all emitters at the level of the tax. Moreover, both provide the same incentives to innovate in a dynamic context. I'm not sure if you want a source for this, but you could find more in just about every environmental economics textbook. 

&gt; To hit a specific target using a tax, the elasticities need to be known. Under an ETS there is no need to know them

There is very much a need to know them as the regulator must set a socially optimal quantity of emissions permits to be traded. This relies on knowing the very same information as we would need to know under a Pigouvian tax. Moreover, there are ways to roughly approximate elasticities, the real problem is knowing firms abatement costs which is of course only known to the firm. However Weitzman (1974) showed that if we know the relative steepness of the marginal costs and marginal benefits we can generally employ a rule of thumb to decide between the two. Specifically, if the marginal cost curves are steeper than marginal benefits, then price control (carbon tax) will generally result in less of a DWL when uncertainty exists regarding abatement costs. Important to note that here the policy is not the case of the DWL per se, information asymmetries are causing the market failure. 

Weitzman: https://scholar.harvard.edu/weitzman/files/prices_vs_quantities.pdf

The reasons why economists tend to prefer price over quantity control isn't about one being more efficient than the other in a stripped down, simplified model. Theoretically both should have the same result. However we know have several decades of experience with ETS to draw from, particularly the EU ETS. There are many variables that can influence whether a carbon market will function properly, including volume of trades, forward markets, number of participants, etc. This implies there are a lot of ways a carbon market can perform poorly. Newell et al (2013) gives a good review of some of these problems.

Newell: https://www.jstor.org/stable/41825465?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents

Also, linking carbon markets can be quite complex. When the overall objective is to create a harmonized global carbon price, a tax is an administratively easier route.

Together with your later point about pride coming before a fall, I guess you're trying to understand Leavers through the lens of some old-fashioned thing like honour codes or some equivalent delusion of grandeur.

I think that's the wrong way to go about it. There *is* a sense in which the old post-war social compact has eroded since Thatcher, and the social standing of regular voters has been diminished. But people are not reacting against that trend for prideful reasons, rather for practical ones - the promises of a better life for our children have been switched out for zero-hours, generation rent, nil pension ... by Labour and Lib Dems as much as by Tories. Once the working class was defeated as a political force, the spoils of profitable growth immediately switched from being distributed by an active State to being shovelled offshore for the benefit of our new plutocrats and those few lucky enough to find a gig helping them pump out the value. 

If you want to understand Leavers it's necessary to stop acting as if George Osborne was telling the truth when he said ""We're all in it together"". That's the giant lie at the heart of the Remain dream.

&gt; I genuinely don't get how you see this playing out without us ending up being supremely humiliated on the world stage by a number of powers 

So we're, what, the fifth (or sixth?) largest national economy in the world, with a unique diplomatic footprint. What Blair dismisses as a medium-sized country in his ""power is power"" argument, putting our clout behind higher population places like Indonesia and India. 

Well, OK, but how do other non-aligned nations manage, even much smaller ones? As it turns out, pretty damn well, if they play their cards right and recognise that the big beasts are in *competition* for access and cooperation. We have a market, still, and skills, to which others want access. There's no need for bullies to have their way.

&gt;WTO rules form the weakest negotiating position we can start from. Once we put ourselves in that position we need to *start negotiating*.

Yes, and it's frustrating that Westminster has allowed the EU to back us into this corner, however the only way out short of abject surrender is to kick a hole in the wall. Once we've done that the dynamic with the EU shifts. It loses its claim on providing the responsible approach due to the damage to member state economies caused by its gamesmanship. New potentials will rapidly emerge.

&gt;**The US:** This is the worst time in recent history to try and get a good deal with the US

Canada has been inside *NAFTA* for years and has a deal with the EU. This stuff is overly catastrophised for the sake of making independence sound impossible. It's far from impossible.

&gt;**The EU**: If you perceive the EU as bullies now, 

They're just technocrats attempting to resist the centrifugal forces in all of their member nations. If and when the UK slips the leash, they will be in quite a different world. 

&gt;On top of this they'll not accept food exports from us 

See above.

&gt;**China**: Not much to say here other than we all expect them to be totally ruthless in negotiations based on experience. 

I don't see a categorical difference between China and the eschaton the EU is attempting to immanentize in Europe. Europe still distinguishes itself from China in terms of the democratic rights we enjoy here, underpinned by a strong demos in most of our nation states, but the EU system and its ardent defenders seem to be increasingly unenthusiastic about those. 

&gt;**Zero-tarrifs:** The idea that we can trade on zero-tariffs 

Yeah, I don't get that, myself.
