&gt; # Se estrena ‘Carmen y Lola’, la película sobre lesbianas gitanas que fue retirada de una muestra de cine – Inpelis
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt; **‘Carmen y Lola’** fue una de las películas encargadas de representar a España en la Quincena de realizadores de la última edición del Festival Internacional de Cine de **Cannes** . También fue elegida por la **Academia del Cine Europeo**, junto a _Handía_, para representar a nuestro país. Sin embargo, la película dirigida por la bilbaína **Arantxa Echevarría** ha cosechado fama entre el público no tanto por romper un **tabú** como es el amor entre dos mujeres homosexuales de etnia gitana, sino por la **polémica** que ha acarreado desde el inicio del proyecto.
&gt; 
&gt; Fue el pasado mes de junio cuando **colectivos feministas gitanos** llamaron al boicot a la proyección de la película en la XXXII Muestra de Cine y Mujeres de Pamplona, que realiza la **Fundación IPES** de la capital navarra cada año y que está financiada por el Ayuntamiento y el Gobierno autonómico. Se trataba de la primera proyección de la película en España. No obstante, las **presiones** recibidas por la Asociación Gitanas Feministas por la Diversidad terminaron por causar la **retirada del filme** de la programación.
&gt; 
&gt; La directora de la película, Arantxa Echevarría, ya había denunciado en anteriores ocasiones el boicot que se estaba llevando a cabo para impedir la emisión de la película tras haber soportado “**escupitajos, insultos y recriminaciones** por la calle y por las redes”. Según recoge [El Correo](https://www.elcorreo.com/culturas/cine/boicot-gitanas-feministas-20180606152729-nt_amp.html), tras las quejas del colectivo feminista de gitanas, **la directora “se negó” a participar en la charla** que tendría lugar con motivo de la muestra.
&gt; 
&gt; En un comunicado, la realizadora explicó que “el IPES llamó a la asociación de gitanas explicándoles que yo no quería entrar en el debate y éstas le contestaron que **irían al cine, que movilizarían a todo el mundo con pancartas**, con manifestaciones en mi contra y de la película. El IPES, por **miedo a las represalias**, me comentó que lo mejor era quitar la película de la programación. **Me pareció lo más correcto** tal y como estaba desarrollándose toda esta montaña de sinsentidos”.
&gt; 
&gt; [Image](https://e00-elmundo.uecdn.es/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2018/08/31/15357097619111.png)
&gt; 
&gt; La propia Fundación publicó su propio comunicando explicando que “el **desencuentro**, ya existente antes de la Muestra entre la directora que acompaña la promoción de la película y el colectivo de gitanas feministas, imposibilitaba la realización de esta sesión”.
&gt; 
&gt; La película, que finalmente fue proyectada durante las celebraciones del **Orgullo Gay de Bilbao** a finales del pasado mes de junio, se estrenará e los cines españoles el próximo **7 de septiembre**. Varios colectivos gitanos han criticado la película por considerar que **perpetúa los estereotipos** de esta etnia: “Ser gitana y lesbiana es difícil en un **mundo payocentrista y heteronormativo**, no solo en la comunidad gitana como pretende mostrar la película”, asegura en un comunicado la asociación Gitanas Feministas. Para **Carmen Fernández**, vicepresidenta de la asociación, las críticas no son contra la película, que **reconocen no haber visto**, sino contra las declaraciones “de **feminismo paternalista**” de la directora.
&gt; 
&gt; Críticas a parte, la película ha cosechado muy buenos comentarios en el extranjero por atreverse a tratar un tema “complicado” que no se había abordado antes. Serán los espectadores los que tengan la última palabra.
&gt; 
&gt;  Arantxa Echevarría explicó en su día la dificultad que tuvo a la hora de encontrar a las dos protagonistas de la película. Ninguna de las candidatas quería ocupar el papel principal hasta que aparecieron **Zaira Romero** y **Rosy Rodríguez**, dos mujeres que, a pesar de ser heterosexuales, se presentaron al casting con la idea de encarnar a Carmen y Lola, una estudiante de instituto y una empleada de mercado.
&gt; 
&gt; La película narra la historia entre dos adolescentes gitanas que se enamoran y luchan por llevar a cabo sus metas ante el rechazo y la discriminación de su comunidad y su propia familia.

But I also think that part of your frustration stems from the inadequate help you are receiving from their customer service. I mean, if a laptop, not even a year old, is being serviced multiple times, you'd think Dell would accept the product is quite defective.

&amp;#x200B;

Having said that, I think remaining calm and polite to customer service would help you a lot. Don't lose your temper with them or use rude words- nothing is guaranteed to get you less help than being rude to the people trying to help you. (Not saying that you're rude, of course, but you just have to go over to r/talesfromtechsupport to know that no one is keen to help a rude customer, and some people will go out of their way to help a nice one.) 

&amp;#x200B;

The relevant laws may depend on your particular jurisdiction- are you in the UK? The US? Europe? There are normally laws about consumer protection that regulate what happens if you receive a defective product. These laws are meant to protect consumers, seeing as there is a (usually) a power imbalance between a big producer and a small consumer. Finding the relevant clause which explains what happens if you receive a defective product may help.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I would continue to communicate with them. If they really refuse to help and the laptop continues to be defective, you may obtain results by quoting whatever piece of consumer legislation is in your favour - for example, some defective products may require replacement if repairs can't fix it. Remember to ask nicely! Companies sometimes back down when legislation is quoted at them, but be prepared for them to not budge either- they know it is unlikely that you will actually pursue them, it would cost you too much.

&amp;#x200B;

Universities normally have a legal clinic where members of the public can go to get free legal advice given by supervised law students, so if you're not sure where to start on the legislation that may be your best bet.

In the U.S., many fliers use budget airlines for work week commuting, not just weekend trips. So again, they will skip the excessive baggage if they're going to have to pay extra to bring extra on the plane.

As background, Russia has long been a nation culturally divided by Europe and Asia, and unhappy in either.  When riding on the steppes, Russians dream of Paris; and when in Paris, they long for the vast open spaces of Asia.  

But this division is far reaching, because Europeans and Asians have an entirely different view of life.  The former hold individuality as the greatest good; the latter rank it far behind family, village, nation and other loyalties.

As foreigners have noted:  when a Russian acts like a European, he is lying; but when he acts like an Asian, you can believe what he says.

A great introduction to this alien character is found in the brilliant movies of Sergei Eisenstein, Ivan the Terrible, Part I (1944), and Part II (1958).  Then, by a different director, Peter the First (1937), and Conquest of Peter the Great (1938).

Them refusing to compensate us for their illegally extracted tariffs after multiple trade board rulings demanding they do so should have been the impetus for us to start divesting ourselves from them.  Becoming so integrated with the American economy was easy.  We should have taken the hard path, and done more to develop trade partnerships in Europe and Asia (human rights permitting).  

It's the same calculus now.  Trump isn't that much worse than previous administrations, he's not some insane aberration, he's the obvious next step in America's political trajectory.

The US had never set a foot in any islands except Iwojima, although remaining soldiers and civilians had surrendered on September 3rd on  USS Dunlap. I'm not sure if civilians were at the sight of American officers at the time of the signing. By this signing, the Ogawasara Islands had became an occupied territory of the US.

The evacuated civilians had sheltered and worked around Yokohama, and one of the village leader,  Fred Savory, had contacted U. Alexis Johnson, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State who was in Tokyo at the time, and negotiated the return of the residents and GHQ had only approved for families of American-European Origin to go back. When they had returned, they found only two houses stood still so they had to live with American troops.

I worked at the Ataturk airport for two years as a profiler. I can tell you, the airport is ok, the issue is -as you almost said- with passengers. People do with what they have. And don’t forget, Ataturk airport is one of the busiest airports in the world. And they’re really doing so so well relatively to the number of people passing by this connection point.

As someone who travelled a lot, in many countries, I can tell you it’s a pretty decent airport. Even compared to European airports. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been in Paris CDG or London and nobody would come and inform us in moments of delay or whatever. In IST, everybody is doing their best (except girls sticked to their iPhones, I know) to ensure passengers are informed and the work is done. I know this form personal experience, people in Turkey care about travelers, if not all of them, most of them do.

I like both classes and most of the salty players are usually warriors and clerics because Trion is bad at balancing. I would suggest not investing a single dime in any of Trion games because the company is just scavenging for money to finance other things rather than invest it back into their games. The plan for them is to rehash content that has been rehashed already. It is quite lame to be honest. They didn't put much work into this expansion like NT or SL. It was built in a way to just milk players with as little content as possible.

In fact the end game is so bad I would suggest you just do the story line quest and don't even raid or do dungeons. They are terrible.. I would definitely wait for some popular upcoming MMO to sub to. Even if it may be bad at least you know the devs are putting effort to fix it.  Kickstarter games usually have more success these days as its very heavily player driven unlike Rift where they basically ignored their players for nearly 2 years and expected it to still make them money.

​

Prime was a another flop because it kind of impacted live terribly. It made people quit live and it was a no brainer for players to realize what would happen when they released prime.  For instance, my guild was 30-40 players online and we had to rebuild from losing  nearly 60 players after Trion forced pay to win or play for the last expansion. We managed to rebuild our guild and have 3 groups raiding BoS successfully then they release prime and now their is only like 2 players online..we don't raid much in our guild and I usually just go to another guild or try to pug BoS.  The impact was horrible.

​

What did players ask for! They wanted EU/NA players to play together so that they had more players to play with because it was getting depressing trying to fill missing spots.  Making prime only made this problem exponentially worse. That is why now both prime and live are terrible condition.

Are you familiar with Germany? Because this seems like a very US-centric argument generalized to Europe. Well, sometimes that works and this time it doesn't.

And while I would agree that it's a problem if the seems like the government is just inviting in lots of refugees that then come and thieve and steal and rape and murder (our culture?) my issue is with the perception.

Because it's an overreaction, based on what reality actually looks like. But people believing that still has negative consequences, no matter how wrong they estimate the facts. So if anything what we need is just for everyone to calm the fuck down and look at what's actually going on, not what could perceivably be going on if our worsts fear and nightmares were true.

And what we'd find is that yea, some shit is actually not going great. But by and large we're actually, really, seriously doing okay.

same could be said with all other anime mmorpg titles because they're all under garbage companies (this applies to every single game i will be listing btw)

also there is no doubt every anime mmorpgs are very inactive in both early/late game (it hurts to tell you this because all of the companies treat the english community like garbage, most of the korean devs treat their own country like garbage but aren't brave enough to sell founder packs to koreans LOL)

**Mabinogi** is one of my favorate anime mmorpgs with so much freedom and a large world to explore, i always played in alexina because it was the most popular server. this game has the most depth and content out of all anime mmorpgs. it used to be called the 3d runescape.

**Soul Worker** is a 3d mmorpg with wasd controls and click to attack that everyone should try just for the graphics people suggest the burning soulworker private server. gameforge hosts this so i'm in the same boat as others.

**Closers** is also a decent anime side scroller that also has a private server code: closers which is superior imo, i hate enmasse ever since they ruined tera. the story is about people with super power protecting the modern city from a alien invasion.

**Tree of Savior** is ran by the imcgames, they developed granado espada, anyways this is a anime like mmo with a european setting. it is similar to ragnarok but uses 3d models and has far more quests (new players may think it's a quest grinder) but you can grind in instance dungeons starting from lv.50 or grind in fields. after lv.200 you can enter challenge mode and grind wave of monsters with a party to level even quicker. there are end game raids and guild wars. - you can use keyboard mode/ mouse mode / controller for this game and it has alot of class build variety compared to the usual mmos. - downside about the game is that their lack of support / communication keeps discouraging players to quit so the playerbase is ever dropping but it's no doubt one of the prettiest games to play.

honestly if you want active end game you either give up on the anime and just play guild wars 2 / warframe / path of exile or suffer :( good luck!

 The basic question of proprietorship and its legitimation is written small when
students anywhere in the world ask aloud to whom the university belongs. On a global scale, men in all
parts of the world are being compelled by the multiplying hints of impending doom to ask: to whom does
the world belong? It is a mark of our heritage that this question is framed in a context of ownership; but the
very asking of the question can perhaps lead men out beyond proprietary abuse towards a shared
responsibility for recuperation, maintenance and ecologically balanced development of the limited
resources available to us on this planet. And chief of all these resources, as even economists are being
challenged to take seriously, are human beings.""
As Erich Fromm recently put it, a ""revolution of hope"" is possible only in and through a humanization
of technology."" But neither past nor present policies with regard to ""modernization"" lend much support to
the notion that a humanization of technology might come about by way of some sort of historical
inevitability. If it is to come at all, it will somehow be the result of a deliberate and concerted effort on the
part of all who have recognized other alternatives as intolerable and have somehow translated this
recognition into political-or, perhaps better, supra-political-power. It is indeed conceivable that present-day
socio-political relations can be transformed
192 Edmund F. Byrne
into what Amitai Etzioni calls ""the active society."" But, as this socio-political analyst intimates, the
structure within which each power group must operate is rapidly becoming international and to some
extent already global in scope. Accordingly, so long as the efforts of social outcasts in South Africa to
control their own destiny are not effectively combined with those of others in the same region or continent,
if not beyond, the supranational power elite who contend primarily only among themselves for control of
knowledge, communications and technology will continue to confuse the weakness of the politically
disorganized as a mandate to continue ruling as in the past.""
It would seem, then, that the very survival-to say nothing of the prosperity-of the great majority of
human beings on this planet is to a great extent a function of utility as defined by the powerful few."" But as
machines continue to substitute for and supersede not only the physical but even the intellectual labor of
human beings, the latter will, in terms of work, be of no further use save to provide ""services"" for one
another."" At this point, their continued existence may be tolerated only so long as they are willing to stay
out of the way and not try to gain what some call ""a piece of the action."" ""Short-run"" unemployment is still
so identified in developed societies with ""long-run"" economic growth that its presumably temporary
victims are afforded at least minimal compensation. But extended unemployment of the kind that is often
the lot of people in the ""developing"" societies leads inevitably to widespread hunger and despair, and the
latter tend to find expression in rebellion. But a despair born of hunger (spiritual as well as physical) and
reared on oppression may seek its maturity in violence.""
The long-range consequences of this increasingly dangerous world situation might well be a century
not of genocide as such but of paupercide: the indirect elimination of the non-productive and the direct
elimination of the counter-productive in many if not all parts of the world. If this be a kind of paranoia,
then let it be said in defense of paranoia that it is supported by a large body of substantive data whose
implications become clearer with each passing decade. In spite of such ultimately insignificant
interferences as those brought about by kidnapping, airplane hijacking, rooftop sniping or the bombing of
buildings, the opposition of outsiders against insiders seems inherently futile; and, if pursued in any given
area to the point of major confrontation, could well lead to reprisals so effective

and encompassing as to put the ovens of Auschwitz back into the Middle Ages of Population Control.""
For, while one-half of the world's population is centered in East, South and Southeast Asia and another
one-fifteenth each inhabit Latin America and Africa, control over and development of the world's
resources is centered predominantly in North America, Europe and the USSR."" Moreover, the power-gap
here suggested is widening steadily rather than narrowing.""
As is well known, living conditions in the United States and in India were closer together 150 years ago
than they are now, partly because the latter country's economic growth has been absorbed by its increasing
population. What is yet more sobering, however, is that India is not likely to ""catch up."" Given its present
per capita annual income ($50 as compared with $2,000 in the U.S.A. in 1960), if both were to double over
a decade or so, India's per capita income would then be $100, that of the United States, $4,000. In the
meantime, the United States produces enough food to provide each of its inhabitants with 3,200 calories
per day, twice that of India, which however has more than twice as many people and less than half as much
land, not to mention its incomparably fewer roads, automobiles, and other modern conveniences. To
mention just a few key indicators of technological development, in the United States per capita
consumption of energy in 1959 was almost 8,000 kilograms of coal equivalent, in India it was 150
kilograms; in the United States, 89 million long tons of steel were produced in 1960 (27 percent of the
world total for that year), and 3'73 million metric tons of oil were produced in 1963 (29 percent of the
world total for that year), whereas in India production of both of these sources of energy was then and still
is negligible."" As these sample figures indicate, the United States and India are almost literally worlds
apart; yet it is unlikely that the former will prove very helpful in the latter's efforts towards economic
development, since its economic policies respond primarily if not exclusively to internal demands for
protection against competitive imports. 12
Yet another aspect of the growing international power-gap is the tendency of highly developed
countries to exploit the mineral resources of under-developed nations not yet in a position to take
advantage of such resources themselves. A good example is that of oil. The currently prominent area of
northern Africa called ""the Middle East"" would be a case in point, as would be the now",True,False,False,,0,1535774174,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e5729cm,False,t3_9bzxhz,True,t3_9bzxhz,/r/Paupericide/comments/9bzxhz/a_decent_definition/e5729cm/,,1538544450,1,True,False,Paupericide,t5_nykhu,r/Paupericide,public,,

[So do we.](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/milk-surplus-forcing-canadas-dairy-industry-to-dump-supply/article25030753/) Not an argument. 

&gt;Our system keeps milk prices slightly higher then US due to the way its managed and sold. 

Yeah, that's why I don't like it. And by the way, our milk prices are [hugely dependent on the province](https://bc.ctvnews.ca/are-canada-s-milk-prices-fair-to-consumers-1.3983366). In some, it's a bit over a dollar a liter. In some, it's two bucks. that's stupid, especially since it's actually cheaper in higher-income provinces which means the poorer provinces pay a lot more in relative terms. And you know why that is? Our stupid supply management system.

&gt;Dairy supply management system keeps milk local to the area it's sold and basically cuts out US producers unless they are willing to change the way they make product.

What if I don't want local milk because it sucks? Because Ontario milk is shit in comparison to the milk I had in Europe. I want to buy milk from Alberta or Quebec or something from the States like Wisconsin, because that should be my choices as a consumer. And hey, maybe they make better quality milk! Because Polish milk tastes amazing and so does French milk compared to shitty Ontario milk.

&gt;The US wants the ability to dump shit product at a lower price into the country.

Lower prices are good for the consumers. If we can allow the Americans access to our market by creating either a universal North American standard for milk production or forcing them to abide by our standards - and still offer us milk at the same price or lower than local suppliers, I don't have a problem with it. People who like local milk will buy local milk. Others who want cheap milk will buy cheap milk. 

&gt;Instead of people fighting to fix our own system they want to allow another country to destroy local dairy producers by undercutting them in the Canadian market.

Because there won't be any attempt to fix our current system because it works perfectly for the milk and farm lobbies which provide political support to our parties. Why would they want to change it? And why would the politicians risk changing the system if it costs them votes and monetary support? 

The current supply management status quo makes it so that there is no incentive to better their products or to expand into new markets if their market share and profits are guaranteed by the government. They won't change unless there's an existential threat to their market practices and profits - and that will only happen if the Americans get into the fray.

If you are likely to have more than a passing interest, get the best model you can afford. A good microscope is a pleasure to use and will last you many years. It will also have a good resale value so you can use it for years, sell it and it will have cost you very little.

I would not recommend the really cheap microscopes (anything under around £300 - 400) as they are rubbish.

Aim to spend around £500 or more.

You can buy used brand models on ebay with a bit of patience. Get a complete working model with objectives in good condition as buying individual spares can be expensive.

If you are in Europe and want to buy new, I can recommend this model that I reviewed a few years ago (full disclosure: this is my website).  https://micro-science.co.uk/product/iscope-microscope-led-trino/ It has a 10 year warranty too.

I own lots of microscopes (some of them very expensive) and for daily use, this one really is good enough.

yes there have been votes for regional parliaments in england people voted against it. 

&gt;I could say that lack of representation in England has caused Brexit. But that is a wild claim. Try to convince me, though, that it is not true.


I would agree though it was about EU representation, brexit was a result of the UK experiencing the highest levels of immigration in its history, then the EU making clear only weeks before the vote that it would never make any kind of compromise of concession on free-movement such as a yearly cap on numbers so long as the UK was a member. People in the UK already felt the EU doesn't represent them and only cared about its own agenda of creating an EU super state, this hammed that point home at the worse possible time. 

Polling seems to support that given the focus of the UK public was on immigration and the UK inability to change or override EU laws. And support for leave jumped after the EU sent Cameron packing after his attempted renegotiation. 

Where as polls also showed if the EU had made a significant compromise on freedom of movement there would have been landslide support for remain. (I saw some polls showing 70% would vote for remain if the reforms Cameron initially wanted were secured)

All those groups of people you are labeling with your prejudices. The actual topic here. Please pay attention.

Which you brought up after I told you that it is a practice that is **not** common here. You disregarded that and started to come up with some story from London. You still disregard it and now being faced with your strategy you try to shift the discussion to either me or some kind of ""radical Islam"" thing that seems to be a virus that has to apply in the same way everywhere which would justify your failed ""observation"" regarding those Turk and Arab females. 

&gt; You are awful at arguing. 

Let's remember, you've started out with the usual ""I'm not a racist, I have a black friend""-argument to negate what OP said regarding racism in Germany to swiftly switch over to some biased observation of yours that those arabs and turks won't let their daughters play with the whites and because of that whites should not be called racist. 

That pitiful back paddling you've started to practice since then and shifting the blame and topic from that to me or to other countries is now what you consider arguing?

**Shay Given**


The experienced and professional Shay Given was signed from Newcastle United in 2009 to be City’s first choice goalkeeper by Mark Hughes. However, Mancini eventually replaced him with Joe Hart in 2011 and he was firmly our second choice by the time of the Cup final. Unhappy with his lack of playing time, Given pushed for a move to Aston Villa to become first choice after this season, but he only stayed as their first choice for a solitary season.


After a reasonably successful loan spell at Middlesbrough, Given joined Stoke City as a back-up for Jack Butland for the last couple of years of his playing career. About a year after being released by Stoke, Given announced his retirement from professional football earlier this year and is currently Derby County’s goalkeeping coach.


**Pablo Zabaleta**


The humble right-back joined City in 2008 as a replacement for Vedran Corluka and became the final signing before the Sheikh Mansour takeover. Zaba started as a right-back with Richards and Dunne as the CBs, but by this time, Micah had been played by Mancini as a right-back, over-taking him. However, showing the hard work and determination that made him such a fan favourite, Zabaleta would ultimately claim the right-back spot as his own, following the 2011/12 title winning season and became the captain in Vincent Kompany’s absence.


Unfortunately, though he was a vital part of the team from 2012-2015, in 2015/16, injuries started to limit his playtime, leading to more Bacary Sagna having to fill in. After Pep Guardiola’s first full season, Zaba left in the great full-back exodus, following an emotional send-off. He’s since had a great first season for West Ham United, establishing himself as their first choice right-back and is still playing football at a high level.


**Dedryck Boyata**


The Belgian international was a part of our youth set-up, being a part of the 2008 team that won the FA Youth Cup. After being promoted to the first team squad the following year, Mancini started him in a couple of cup matches and he got a few minutes the following season, notably getting sent off against Arsenal. He was on his way out by the time of the cup final, leaving for Bolton and then Twente on loan, though he got a couple of appearances in Pellegrini’s first two seasons.


In 2015, he was sold to Celtic, where he was established as a first team player. Over three seasons at Celtic, he established himself as one of their starting centre-backs and an important player. Unfortunately, he seems to have demanded a move away in this past season, which has understandably led to anger amongst Celtic fans. In the end, Boyata has stayed at the club, but likely has work to do to get back on the good side of the fans.


**James Milner**


Milner was another one of Roberto Mancini’s 2010 summer signings that promised much. He started off the club well and scored an equaliser early on in City’s cup run, during an exciting 2-2 draw with Leicester City. Following this season, he became a well-valued player for Mancini, being an important part of the demolition of Man United at Old Trafford and later Pellegrini viewed him as a valuable player, starting Milner on the wing frequently for much of his last two seasons at the club.


Milner left for Liverpool in the summer of 2015 and unfortunately, since then, he hasn’t exactly enamoured himself with City fans, criticising being played as a winger and celebrating after scoring against us. Still, he’s excelled in multiple positions for Liverpool and established himself as one of Klopp’s most reliable players since the German came in. Milner was an important part of Liverpool’s Champion’s League campaign last year and is still playing at a very high level, scoring as recently as two weeks ago.


**Adam Johnson**


Known for reasons… outside of football, Adam Johnson was a promising youth player for Middlesbrough, bought by Manchester City in the 2010 January transfer window. Johnson was actually an extremely prominent player for City in his first few years at City, being involved in over 30 league games. In this final, he even came on for Gareth Barry.


After being involved pretty significantly in the title winning season, he was sold to Sunderland in 2012 and he was a prominent player there for several seasons. Unfortunately, he famously was convicted for grooming and sleeping with an underage girl and he’s currently in prison for this. Not much more to say, except he’s an irresponsible idiot.


**Patrick Vieira**


Arsenal midfield legend Patrick Vieira’s career was winding down by the time he played the last few seconds of this cup final, but he still was able to have some impact in midfield for a couple of seasons for City. This match was his last appearance as a professional footballer, before retirement at the end of the season. Viera stayed involved with Manchester City and was appointed as City’s Football Development Executive. Perhaps to pursue a career in management, he was appointed reserve team manager in 2013.


With strong connections to the CFG (City Financial Group), Vieira was appointed as manager of New York City FC and proved to be a strong and capable manager. He was able to improve NYCFC from 17th place when he came in to 4th by the end of the season and 2nd by the end of the next season. During the summer, he returned to Europe and was appointed by OGC Nice, ahead of the 2018/19 season.


**Edin Džeko**


Edin Džeko was signed by Mancini in the January transfer window where he was broadly used as a back-up striker (though still made a fair amount of starts). He didn’t come on for this cup final, but he did go on to have a pretty prolific time at Eastlands, being one of City’s most dangerous players in the first half of the 2011/12 title campaign and being a valued player of both Mancini and Pellegrini.


Unfortunately, though he was an immensely talented striker, he always struggled to get consistent minutes, playing second fiddle to Sergio Aguero during his time here. After a pretty lacklustre 2014/15 season, exacerbated by a calf injury, Džeko left for Roma in the summer. Džeko has done very well since arriving in Italy, scoring 45 goals across three seasons and being a vital part of the Champion’s League Semi-final spot last year.

Yes immigrants increase supply as well as demand.  
Also the figures aren't really that high. Net EU migration for 2017 dropped to 100,000 and non EU was 227,000 [(source)](https://fullfact.org/immigration/eu-migration-and-uk/). 24,000 EU and 104,000 Non-EU migrants came here to study and so will almost exclusively be housed in student accommodation. That leaves just short of 200,000.
Sadly I couldn't find figures for 2017 but in 2016, 85,000 people came to the UK to accompany others [(source)](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/bulletins/migrationstatisticsquarterlyreport/may2017) and so don't put additional pressure on the market.

Hewwo thewe x3!

We're *&lt;OwO&gt;* and we're looking for people to raid with during BFA.

***What are we going to do?***

After deciding the mythic raiding life is not for us anymore, but pugging is a nightmare as well, our group of friends has decided to set up a guild with which we clear the newest released raid on heroic until we have it on farm, and then after that we cut our raiding days down to one until the next raid comes out, in which we will do the same. We're still figuring out the set days for when the raid comes out according to peoples schedules. Sometimes if people are up for it we might raid 3 times a week (Most likely on raid release) and sometimes we might just raid 1 day. The initial plan is to raid 2 days a week until we have Heroic on farm, and after that we're cutting down to 1 raid day a week. Raid times will probably be around 19:30/20:00 to 23:00 server time. (Or until how long we feel like, be it earlier or later)

***What are we looking for?***

We're looking for a **healer** to fill out the roster so we have a bit more than 10 people to depend on to be able to raid. Currently we have a roster of 14 people. We're looking for people who fit in to our group personality wise, skill at the game is secondary to that. We're looking to have a group of chill and relaxed people, and to have fun while raiding. I guess that the type of person we're looking to have in our guild is the kind of person who can laugh about having OwO under their character name. Even though we're on Draenor, we wouldn't mind raiding with people crossrealm if they fit in with the group and don't want to server transfer (Or if you want to raid with us but also already have a guild, we don't mind sharing)

You have failed to give any example of bullying, or indeed vindictiveness. Your last example was of a country being asked to meet criteria for stabilising itself in order to secure a bail out.

It sounds more like an episode of The Americans with a dash of Mad Max and Fight Club mixed in. Yet this is exactly what is happening across Europe and North America as Russia’s intelligence services co-opt fringe radicals and angry young men to try to undermine Western democracies from within. And not just in the virtual world, but in real life.


And later:
&gt;Right-wing groups are more easily drawn into the Russian orbit with anti-immigrant, anti-LGBTQ, and anti-feminist rhetoric and by a narrative that **stresses a collectivist,** tribal, and racially exclusive worldview.

&gt;Finally, the Western radical right is attractive to the Kremlin not only because it provides a pool of recruits—often angry young white men—for stirring up social protests, but also because it serves as a backdoor for establishing ties with far-right political parties and anti-establishment politicians.

I understand that information about the Pecolumbian americas is much harder to come by then other areas of history, and that doing research can be *extremely* challenging if you don't know where to look, but the amount of just zero to minimum effort videos is staggering. Off the top of my head:

- The classic misconception of the ""Aztec, Maya, Inca"" as a trio of complex american civilizations is universal (the Aztec/Maya and Inca are from two independent cradles of civilization, both of which have many, many other comparably complex cultures and civilization)

- Calling these groups ""tribes"" when in reality they lived in urban cities, have signficant social stratifcation with social classes, nobility, and economic and adminstrative systems, and state goverments

- Talking about the Maya as if they are a singular culture or empire, wheras they had a bunch of seperate (though linked via political unions and ruling-subservient relationships) city-states and kingdoms, with MANY different ""maya"" cultures, with Maya being an *entire language tree with over 30 languages*; and that they just vanished after the end of the Classical period

- Repeating myths about the Conquest of Mexico, such as that the Spanish were successful due to superior technology (was a factor but not a large one), or that it was over with the fall of the Aztec empire as if there weren't many, many other empires and city-states in the region

Etc. 

Even channels that clearly *did* do some research fall prey to eurocentricism in general. 

Emperortigerstar's [The History of North America: Every Year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IKcS4DlaTw) video, for example, shows that he did do research, with the mention of The Zapotec, Epi-Olmec, Teotihuacan, The Mixtec, the Huastecs, the Purepecha/Tarascan empire, etc, but generalizes these and the Maya by culture, rather then showing the rise and fall of specific city-states and political alliances. I realize that the amount of research that would require would be *insanely exhaustive*, since that info is much, much more obscure and is less clear then for many european states, but the info is still out there for many cities and key alliances and he could have at least done them for key cities like Monte Alban for the Zapotec, many major Maya Cities, since their political histories escaped spanish destruction and are well documented, etc..... 

Likewise, BIll Wurtz's [history of the entire world, I guess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuCn8ux2gbs) mentions Norte Chico, Teotihaucan, the Misssipsians etc, things that clearly showed he at least *bothered* to do more then a typical wikipedia skimming, but he mentions the Americas, like, what 6 times in the entire video when he *easily* could have done quips and jokes about events like he did for europe and asia far more then that, especially since unlike with Tigerstar he doesn't need to show specific or roughly accurate borders. In fact he could probably do an entire seperate video on mesoamerica alone in the same style a la his japan one.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, with that all said, i'd like to spotlight the few *good* videos on Mesoamerica and the precolumbian americas in general.

- The Kings and Generals channel, in conjunction with Cogito (who I believe is /u/JackManiels) did a stellar series of videos on the Aztec, Maya and Inca (I don't know much about Incan history but based on what I do know it checked out), which are now unlited, but are being replaced by [even more in depth videos on them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfDdeNmZJY4&amp;list=PLaBYW76inbX5xFVjwMXSPd-UFSa3LQ_mq), with a 4-parter for the Inca, and a 3-parter for the Maya done, and the Aztec on the way. Again, sort of falls prey to the ""great 3"" myth, but the accuracy and level of detail in the info provided is nearly flawless. (I can also give links to the old versions, if people want)

- Epimetheus's [History of Ancient Mexico, Aztecs, Maya and more Explained in ten minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfSTd6FRrVM&amp;) is a pretty solid overview of Mesoamerican history. It's not perfect, but it's *far* better then 99% of the content covering it on youtube. 

- Crash Course's [The Americas and Time Keeping: Crash Course History of Science #5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCBDUDwaeCA) is pretty solid as well. I normally dislike Crash Course since it tends to be very eurocentric and the very, very few times till now it's delved into Mesomaerica has been barely adequate, but this is a pretty strong overview. 

- Overly Sarcastic Productions's [Miscellaneous Myths: Quetzalcoatl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=451jzIesWoU&amp;list=PLGTfwcb8YUlDnvXQ6_SgP6GtXpXsKE_US&amp;) and [Misellaneous Myths: Huitzilopotchli](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj-jDOjBets). Again, like Epimetheus's video, not perfect, but very, very solid with way less issues then almost all other videos on youtube. Less solid is their [History Summerized: The Aztec, Maya, and Inca](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC0PgqB-XuE&amp;) which has a fair bit more problems, and if most content on youtube about the americas wasn't so awful I probably wouldn't reccomend, but it's still heads and shoulders above much of it's competition, but I have some reservations with reccomending it,.  

- Another recommendation with a grain of salt is  Ollie Bye's [The History of Mesoamerica: Every Year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8yy5fg9Ohw). This is basically what I wish EmperorTigerstar and every other ""map over time"" video covering mesoamerica was like, documenting the rise and fall of specific states rather then just generalizing stuff as ""maya"" or ""mixtec"" into giant blobs (albiet still not to the extent I would like, basically not showing any of the hundreds of the central mexican city states the Aztecs would eventually conquer) but even I aren't knowledgeable enough to attest to the accuracy of many of the specifics shown in it, and I do see some stuff that strikes me as iffy: The Maya Kaan kingdom, IE Calakmul's kingdom, surviving past the end of the classical period till 900CE before Mayapan swallows up most of the northern yucatan, when Calakmul, as far as I know, lost a massive war towards the end of the classicwhen Tikal and other city-states rallied against them, as an example of one iffy thing I see, another is the mention of a ""First toltec civil war"", which i've never heard of or are even aware we have specific enough records on the toltecs to know about

Most of these videos I have left comments on detailing the few errors they've made, so if you are curious about what those are load all comments and search for ""Jabberwockxeno"". Some of them I haven't commented on yet but I will over the course of the next few hours since I'm making this post and want people to know what bits are off or are potentially off. 

For convenience here are direct links to my comments on these videos with corrections or additional info. I'll update this as I leave comments on the ones I haven't yet. 

- For the Kings &amp; Generals Maya videos, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sK9yv5wAoY0&amp;lc=UgwAYOWWJBHuvi52vU14AaABAg) is my comment on the first video. On the second, sadly, my comment got eaten by a spam filter, and while K&amp;G said he cleared it, it's still not publicly visible. [here's](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DjCzLDFX4AEsssJ.jpg) a screenshot of it, however. On the final maya one, my comment is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxwxTgFVUDE&amp;lc=Ugx_fgG-x-y2Z3PYo8h4AaABAg)

- My comment with corrections on Epimetheus's video is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfSTd6FRrVM&amp;lc=UgypoKE7xof2tlLRBit4AaABAg)

- On the crash course video, I had a very, very detailed and highly upvoted comment with corrections and added info, but like with the one on the second Kings and General video it got marked as spam and even though I messaged some of the people who run the channel to fix it, and they said they did, it's still not visible publicly. [here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dic-0eHW4AAhImZ.jpg:orig) is a screencap of it, though

There are two mistakes right now - leaving the country to teach english made it hard to transition back home into a real job and the criminal record just seals the deal.  I don't think causing property damage is as serious as assault or drinking under the influence, so its not as serious a problem as you might think it is.  The career gap of 3 years and being overseas is probably the bigger issue.

Volunteering will not help unless its for an organization that directly aligns with your skill set.  Helping little suzie read or being a big brother to mikie is something that companies dont care very little about.  Doing payroll for a non profit - most definitely.

There are two ways to get around this issue....and its important to realize that corporate jobs are probably never going to happen again.  That career gap is a killer. 

I would look for industries that care more about what you can do, not what check boxes you have.  So construction, sales, restaurant management, etc.  Anything that requires certs like IT or accounting - no

Then when you have saved up enough, you should probably think about moving to a different area - perhaps overseas.  North americans tend to view foreign job experience as worthless - and so when you went to teach english overseas, it was a huge mistake.

Regardless of why you think a Palestinian state doesn't exist,  the fact is that it doesnt.  


&gt;Refugee status is never passed down, except for Palestinians. I’m talking about the Palestinians who were born in other countries. 

Which other countries precisely.  As refugees in general tend to live outside their own country,  and give birth outside their own country too.  Their children are very often classified as refugees too! 

Secondly,  I already explained that Palestine does not exist,  hence the are refugees to a country that doesn't exist,  hence why their status is inherited until such a country does exist or they are readmitted.  Look,  if are American your nationality can be inherited,  Palestinians cant do that,  as Palestine doesn't exist. 


&gt;For example: If my grandfather came to Canada as a Palestinian refugee many years ago, and My father and I were both born in Canada, we would all be consider refugees. 

&gt;In truth, my father and I aren’t refugees, were Canadian. That’s why the number of Palestinian refugees has increased from ~800,000 to millions today. 


1. What is the  status of children born to refugees in Pakistan,  Europe,  israel etc?   Are they considered refugees? 

2. Again Palestine doesn't exist.  



&gt;Those Palestinians living in the West Bank under Palestinian leadership shouldn’t be considered refugees either. 

Why?  If they and their families fled a war in israel and have been stopped from returning or fear persecution if they do. That's what refugees are. 

&gt;Those living in Jordan and Lebanon should have been integrated into society years ago, but they haven’t because other Arab countries want to keep the Palestinian issue alive instead of actually helping the Palestinian people. 


Why cant they just return to their homes?  Is Israel not in the least bit culpable here?  

&gt;Also, what about the 800,000 Jewish refugees who were forced to leave Arab countries in 1948. Israel integrated them into society, unlike what the other Arab states did for the Palestinians. 

What about them?  Im not sure which countries forced them to leave,  but israeli very often encouraged them to leave.  Now lets imagine that after 60 years they had been stopped from returning to their homes having fled a war, what would we call them.

You acted like this concept was a joke, and that it wasn’t real.  All I have done in posting those links is demonstrate you should read more.  The world is more complex than your uninformed opinions.

Here's a different sort of example. The HGTV cable network has a Canadian version. If you watch that one, you will see a much higher amount of Canadian content. There is one show I saw when in Canada, *Leave it to Bryan*, which seemed intended for exclusive consumption by Canadians.

Outras áreas que pegam químicos mas a competição fica maior porque também pegam engenheiros (principalmente) e farmacêuticos são indústrias alimentícias, farmacêuticas, cosméticas etc.

&gt;That the Axis win at all. Without America in the war, what conceivably would have happened was the USSR just beating the Axis with manufacturing power and size alone. In fact, this story could have just as well been the US and UK vs. Communist Europe.

Agreed.  However, in this timeline, the Nazis get the atom bomb before December 1945.  They actually deploy it in December 1945, which is same month that the US tested their first nuclear bomb in the real world.  We don't know exactly how long they've had it for, but it's plausible that it was either directly used, or the threat of it's existence was indirectly used, to encourage the USSR and the UK to surrender.  Also remember that the USSR was very strained up until June 1944 with the D-Day landings that opened a second front.  The entire point of the second front was to relieve the USSR from having to fight to entire war on a single front.  

Again, it's easy to imagine that without a Western front, the Nazis could have rolled over Moscow, especially with the fact that the Allies were conducting an operation to deceive the Nazis about the timing and location of the invasion.  So you can imagine that if you are expecting a massive army of two large powers to open up a front, you are going to delay any new operations/advancements on the existing front, committing defenses to the west and prevent the distraction.

&gt;The Nazis' technological progress is ridiculous in every shape and form. The show seems to show them using Maglevs in New York and Berlin. However, the Maglev concept was created by a British RAF engineer, Eric Roberts Laithwaite, who would conceivably have been killed or imprisoned, his research lost to time. I will give credit where it is due for the depiction of cars in the series; very, very well done.

You don't need to stew on this one.  They are definitely using [monorails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_15_\(S%C3%A3o_Paulo_Metro\)), which are distinct from [maglevs, which look very similar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transrapid).  Monorails run with wheels on a large single rail that they wrap around for guidance, while a maglev floats around it's monorail. [Newer monorails float inside a trench](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maglev#/media/File:Series_L0.JPG).  [The Disneyland monorail was built in 1959](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disneyland_Monorail_System), and one of the oldest monorail systems is actually a [suspended monorail in Germany that was originally built in 1901,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuppertal_Suspension_Railway) so it's historically consistent that a burgeoning Reich with a strong economy could have come up with the system in the show.

...I like trains.

&gt;The Japanese allow Chinese arts to be practiced. I don't understand how the Japs become liberal in this timeline without domineering American influence, but there is no way in hell that the victorious Japanese Empire would allow the presence of Chinese culture.

I'm split on this.  There was a lot of anti-Chinese sentiment in WW2 Japan, and at the time they were eager to expand their empire, so I would agree that they would be trying to stamp out the culture in favor of their own.

However, Japanese history is *chock full* of absorbing aspects of Chinese culture, notably the Chinese alphabet (until it was redesigned by the same guy who imported a new version of Buddhism from, you guessed it - China).  When the Nazis deride the Japanese for their adherence to the chi of the furniture in the German Embassy in San Fransisco, recall that this is part of the revision of Buddhism they got from China.

&gt; The dropping of the bombs on D.C. Just to be clear, I think the Nazis knew very fucking well that NYC was a far more diverse place than most of Europe, with people immigrating from all parts of the continent. And if a German invasion happened, it would be disastrous, in any shape or form, for the Nazis to try to take the city, which would have been furious at the failure of the U.S government, which would have just made any occupation harder. Why didn't they drop it on New York and not on Washington?

Because that's where the President, his cabinet, his generals, and the heads of agencies responsible for governing the country are located.  And with a nuclear bomb in an age when they were just being invented, there were no fallout shelters, reinforced bunkers, etc.  If they had known it was coming, the President might have fled via car, to be caught by an invading army, or tried to hole up in a bathroom and gotten flattened.

When the Americans attacked Japan, they attacked industrial and military targets, because they were interested in trying to lessen the momentum of the Japanese Army and Navy, and throw Japan into something of a war of attrition, which they were already facing from being a small island nation.  

The Nazis knew that their best chances at expanding their power was not to destroy the infrastructure of the US (meaning that they did not attack major manufacturing and cultural centers like Chicago or New York) but to remove the leadership, occupy the land, integrate the people that they could and subjugate the rest into being at least complacent and passive, but still participate in the economy that is now run by the Reich.

Also, while I'm sure it would have given Hitler a boner to methodically raze Washington brick by brick and build it into New Berlin, New York does make sense to me as a governing point, as it's closer to Germany via Atlantic air routes, and it is the de facto cultural center of the US.

&gt;The buffer zones. Does anyone think that these buffer zones, as large as entire U.S states, are fertile ground for the Resistance? Did no one think of that when they wrote up the maps?

I totally agree with this.  It's basically a festering wound of uncontrolled land.

However, I would point out that the Resistance is very active in the Reich territory, almost more than it seems to be in the Neutral Zone.  Sure, there are tons of Resistance members in the Neutral Zone, but they are not about to invade the Western Border.  Meanwhile, Resistance cells in New York are able to attack Obergruppenfuhrer Smith in broad daylight, and cause some serious trouble in Atlanta.

To be specific about the left, there seems to be a kind of radical totalizing worldview, leading to vindictiveness and moral hysteria, where they try to utterly destroy people's careers and personal lives over increasingly minor transgressions.  Fewer leftists seem to vocally support the basic civil rights enshrined in our constitution, and instead support more restrictions under the guise of regulating hate speech, mass shootings, Russian trolls, etc.  In Europe, the left has acquiesced on criticizing Islam / the burka, and instead supports Muslim mass migration, in blatant opposition against most Europeans' who want Muslim migration stopped.

That said what's important is that you have fun really, if that's what you wanna do go ahead.

On to advice, it sounds like you had some really bad luck with your ruler's death at 31 here, which can sadly always happen. That said I recommend having a lot of kids quickly with your first ruler so they and their descendants can act as a safety net to avoid having no heirs at all. As a pagan ruler, you should be able to take up to three unmarried women as your concubines to ensure high kid output if you need to. And if you don't have any heir or your heir is not very suitable due to being a literal baby, try to avoid dangerous situations such as leading battles.

I think your guy is a tribal romuva pagan, right? If so, your best tools of warfare are going to be actions found in the intrigue tab, ""raise tribal armies"" and ""raise zealots"" (or something). The first costs 500 prestige and summons 2500  cheap soldiers in your capital, who will fight for you until you're at peace. The second one can only be used when defending in a religious conflict (such as your holy war here), costs 200 piety, and gives you 2000 slightly better troops than the other one who will also fight until the end of the war. If you keep enough piety on hand, even if the whole of europe attacked you at once you might be able to push them back.

Also, as long as you are unreformed pagan, non-pagans will take huge attrition penalties in provinces you own that are of your religion. Essentially, they shouldn't be able to pile up much more than 3k troops in a single province, without taking heavy losses every 15 days or so.
If you are getting attacked in land of your own religion, it is a viable tactic to wait til the enemies are at your gates, and then some, before attacking their by then severely depleted armies.

Do you know how to research these things yourself?

I just went to the FBI web site and looked at the list of things that exclude you from employment.  Guess what?  You do have to pass an extensive background check, and having Asperger's would probably make it harder to get through that, but it's still possible.  I also personally know multiple people with Asperger's who have passed the more rigorous background check required for employment at the NSA.

I'm intimately familiar with the process for various federal background checks.  My wife works for the federal government as has a similar clearance.  We've been through several of these checks.  She has multiple conditions that require disclosure and none of them have ever been an issue.

I've posted the list of exclusions for the US Military for you multiple times.  Asperger's is not on that list either.  What does exclude you is being medicated for psychiatric/neurological conditions, but there's nothing specific to any particular condition.  Once again, if you want to continue making the claim that you are excluded from military service in the US, produce some documentation.

You may not understand this, but most other countries have many more restrictions that the US does.  Most of Europe does restrict employment in all the ways you are describing, for example.

For the record, I just checked on requirements for the Police in Fairfax County, VA, where I live.  And also for the VA State Police.  Asperger's does not exclude you from employment with either.  Now let's try the Colorado State Police ... guess what?  You are out of luck again.

No, it doesn't. If Labour said that they wanted to maintain membership of the single market, then the manifesto would have made that clear. The manifesto instead says

&gt; strong emphasis on retaining the benefits of the Single Market and the Customs Union

The key here is the phrase ''strong emphasis on retaining''. You cannot logically retain something unless you plan to leave or withdraw from something. Furthermore, it doesn't say all benefits, instead, it leaves it vague as ''the benefits'', which can mean all or some, of which it becomes obvious that they have to only mean some given they also say FoM must end (which means being out of SM as a full member).

What the manifesto means logically speaking is as follows.

&gt; A) Leave the EU, SM and CU (this point is further supported by the intention to drop FoM which the EU made clear dropping FoM will mean the end to full access of the SM).
&gt; B) Attempt to access some of the SM/CU (after leaving FoM) to which cannot breach the agreement to end FoM.

Labour made it clear that FoM will end. What they don't make clear is to what extent will they retain access to the SM/CU and this is the crux of the problem.

The logical outcome of this is that the SM/CU aspect of the manifesto will be the primary point of negotiations, not FoM. FoM must end and whatever the consequences of that are (i.e abandoning full EU membership of the SM) must happen with it. 

I fully agree with you that it was wasn't clear but ultimately if you dissect the words of the manifesto it becomes clear that there are either porkies being told here or they're going for a hard Brexit (unless they remake something identical to FoM and just use that to get access to the SM, in which case it would have been such a disingenuous dishonest move by Labour that they'll have lost all credibility for me).",True,False,False,,0,1535821890,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e57yo1l,False,t3_9bxi3d,True,t1_e57hnla,/r/ukpolitics/comments/9bxi3d/mary_creah_mp_frank_field_gave_40_years_service/e57yo1l/,,1538559621,1,True,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,r/ukpolitics,public,,

It's older than the coalition, but Cameron exaggerated this by preceding over a period of serious economic stagnation and decline for many British people. The Tories and the Tory aligned media then blamed this decline not on the poor job the Tories were doing in economic 'recovery', but instead on the EU and immigrants.

Yeah, that's how tariffs go. Just as tariffs on Canadian cars will screw American buyers, and cost the shareholders of Ford, GM and Chrysler billions (if we pretend that Chrysler is an American company). Further, you understand that most cars are made outside of the US, right? The US sells something like 3 million cars a year to Canada...lol, goodbye.

""Good thing they can they can always buy Canadian cars...wait.""

Ignoring that you seem to be under some delusion that all cars are made in the US, it's actually funny seeing notions about the nationality of car companies. GM sells more cars in China than they do anywhere else. They are, in essence, a Chinese company. Chrysler is an Italian company. Ford is a multinational company that would happily produce cars for Canada in the EU or Mexico.

Nowhere did I say a thing about the US. The US can do whatever they want. But the funny thing about ""dirty"" oil is that you upgrade it, and Canada made the mistake of upgrading in the US, just as refining went to the US.

That doesn't really matter. Violence is found whenever something is enforced as well.

You have to consider the present, not the past.

&gt; Private property cannot be ethical if the way it was founded was both unethical and created massive advantages for some actors from the getgo

Yes it can. There's no record or proof that the property can be given back to the original owner.

&gt; they're really glad these past violences have happened and prefer that the current arrangement of ownership was established through violence.

You can play this game until antiquity and beyond. The world worked through violent conquest. Africans slaughtered Africans. Natives slaughtered natives. Europeans slaughtered Europeans. Etc...

And property wasn't always at the center.

&gt;  reveals that these violences still dictate who's likely to succeed

Nope. No robust analysis exists that compares the amount of violence suffered by various groups in relation to their current income levels.

Something you don't understand is that it's nigh impossible. Reality is immensely complicated.

Anti-Turkish sentiment has always been a thing. Which to be honest, isn't that surprising given that Europe was held for a long time. But let us not kid ourselves. Turks here don't get irritated because of anti-Turkish sentiment. They are angry at the absolute hypocrisy and the two-facedness displayed by the west.

We have seen how Westerners all too readily ignore the Turkish suffering experienced during the 20th century and before. We have also seen how people, such as yourself, had shut their eyes and ears when various Arab cities were bombed in to oblivion by the USAF. Where thousands of civilians were indiscriminately massacred. While also crying foul at any imagined (fire in Tunceli) action by the state.

This doesn't prevent them from being threats or supporting threatening groups. In fact the dude you replied to was lamenting over the idea that even openly supportive nations don't know or want the what's best for Turkey.

&gt; geographically Russia is European but we both know I am referring to ""europe"" in the political sense.

It sounds more like you're referring to western Europe.

&gt; You're basically saying any country that has any sort of conflicting interest with yours, or has relations with other countries than yours is a threat to you.

You're the one who converted this: ""We should let our nations safety rest on their good will."" to mean ""direct and overt threats""

Everything I've mentioned are valid examples on why relying on European good will is not the smart choice.

&gt; It is like Greece saying Europe is a threat to them because they are the largest foreign investors in Turkey.

By the way they're really annoyed about that at times. They go between ""Turkey is calmer this way"" and ""we should hope that Turkey isolates from Europe""

&gt; Mate, Greece isn't a threat to you get off it. Tsipras would probably let you have the entire Aegean if you asked nice enough. This sounds more like a dispute than anything, Greece has these claims but what have they actually done to enforce them? from what I have heard it sounds more like Turkey has taken the more active role of harassment and threatening actions that go beyond diplomatic disagreements. Sevres syndrome is alive and well

European ""good will"" would hand practically the entire sea and its resources over to Greece which in potential future conflicts can cause immense pain for Turkey due to a variety of geographical factors. I can go through a few if you'd like. You're the one obsessing over your own words, I never took ""threat"" to mean existential or immediate, direct, lethal harm.

Unless you want to live in an over-crowded hellhole (I really don't), that means we can only take a comparatively small number of people in.

However, there are tens of millions people looking to migrate to Europe already, and with the African population predicted to grow to over 4.2 billion by the end of the century and the on-going climate change we're looking at likely hundreds of millions potential migrants in the coming decades.

I get it that these people are looking for a better life for themselves, but it is simply unustainable. We are destroying ourselves by letting them all in. Altruism is fine and dandy, but not if it becomes self-destructive, a  point which we're already long past if you ask me.

We don't have to ban all immigration, nobody seriously suggests that. It's not Japanese or Swiss or Canadian or Australian migrants that pose any problem here. It's the MENA migrants, the Africans, the arabized Muslim Asians (Pakistanis, Bangladeshis etc.) that are the problem, both the legal, but especially the illegal ones and the asylum seekers. Even there are a few exceptions, Iranian migrants for example are doing rather well in Europe. But if we would ban immigration from these problematic countries of origin we were all better off. And we could still have immigration from the other, not-so-problematic areas of the world.

Apart from that I think that people have  right to stay the majority in their own countries, something which is increasingly threatened by mass immigration. White Brits are now the minority in several British cities, most prominently London of course. Same in Germany, same all over Europe. 38% of kids under 6 have a migrant background in Germany. This is insane. And there need to be drastic measures to halt this development, including bans on immigration from certain countries and revised asylum procedures.

I do have a problem with calling it extortion (the practice of obtaining something, especially money, through force or threats). China doesn't have the military power to force any country to do anything. They do have some economic power but I do not know of any county that is sanctioned by China. Even the ones who formally recognize Taiwan are only penalized by China not investing there. 

I think it is highly disingenuous to say that China is the new colonists of Africa when they are now investing heavily in Africa when Europe and America have pulled out.

[This](https://imgur.com/a/5BRuzQB) is what European countries time zones would look like roughly, if they were adjusted to solar time (or call it standard/winter time), with some exceptions taking into account also current political and/or economic situations (Iceland's ""real"" solar time zone is -1, Ireland and Portugal could be argued also to be -1, Turkey is between +2 and +3).

It is definitely member states and countries own decision to choose which time zone they want to belong to, but I see this as the ""blank sheet"" from which to start (in cases where particular countries preferred to stay permanently summer-time, they would need to add +1 hour). Surely there are further adjustments to be made to such map, including taking into account the amount of cross-border trading and logistics (for example daily commuters between Germany-Benelux-France) and historical reasonings (the situation we have now).

And other politicians being shit/=a pass to McCain. Whataboutism is not an argument. Even if it was, McCain is literally the pinnacle of neocon behavior, he was shilling for wars till the day he died and repented ZERO times.

In short, McCain was a massive anti American POS who never learned his lesson, I hope his soul is tortured in hell and I make no apologies for someone who shilled for pointless wars, destroyed the lives of millions and was a deep state POS till he died.

Most villages in the UK have their own primary schools, and the nearest secondary may only be 30 minutes away (again, walking).

Hell, the population of my town is 130,000 and we have in total 54 schools. Add in the surrounding areas which brings the total population to 250,000 and the total amount of schools is over 100.

EDIT: I notice a few people saying ""When will European Redditors realise that the US is not like Europe"".

We don't comment on things like this to gloat, or to laugh at America. We do this because we actually like your country, and we want to see it become better. All our lives we consume American media (I'm literally watching NFL highlights right now), we see comments all over social media saying things like ""America is the greatest country in the world"", and then we see threads like this and we're shocked. You teach us that everyone should have equal opportunity, and then you tell us what it's actually like over there and we realise that's all a lie.

Is a child who has to wake up at 5:30 to catch a bus that will take them 2 hours to get to school for 7:45 going to have the same opportunity in life for a kid who wakes up at 8, spent 45 minutes eating breakfast and getting ready before getting into school for 8:55? (Me essentially). No, they aren't. I had 2 and a half hours extra sleep each night (assuming we went to bed at the same time - 9PM), I probably had a much healthier breakfast and I didn't have to spend 4 hours travelling each day.

No, we aren't going to get the same opportunities in life. Because I hear from a lot of people that they got nearly no sleep/breakfast at all. And both sleep and breakfast are super important to making kids actually attentive in school. It's the reason this bill was passed.

EDIT2: I'm well aware of population density, thank you very much. How about instead of telling me about it, you adapt our policies into ways they will work in the US?

**About DDG:** We are looking to recruit around 10-15 new members in anticipation of Forsaken from the US and Europe to bolster our roster. We are an intimate clan of 41 at the moment, concentrating on both PVE and PVP.  We will have regular raid groups scheduled for Tuesday evenings after raid launch.  We use GroupMe as our main communication app and have moderated and unmoderated chats covering a variety of topics, both Destiny-related and otherwise.  We are looking for mature guardians that plan to be ACTIVE throughout Forsaken and that are a good fit with our group.  Please see some general guidelines below.

* 18+ only

* Must be able to use the GroupMe app either on smartphone or desktop and adhere to chat rules (Main chat is SFW, no shitposting in LFG chat, no slurs or hate speech of any kind)

* NO TOXICITY. You are never to yell at fellow clanmates or get upset at them when conducting raids or any other activity.  Any alienation of fellow guardians is subject to removal from the clan.

* Guardians are required to check in one hour before scheduled raid times to ensure there is time to find a substitute in case something comes up.

* Above all, be inclusive and welcoming to all clanmates. We have clan members from a variety of backgrounds and geographic locations.  That means we keep it PC.  This is the internet and we are all friends and joke around, but nothing offensive is to be said.  If it is, it is to cease immediately once you are told something is offensive and that's the end of it.

**How to contact us:** Please contact me on either PSN or Bungie.net (Arctic_16) and tell me why you think you would be a good fit with us and/or what you are looking for in a clan, as well as a little about yourself and where you are located.

&gt; The rampage now stands as a high-water mark in the outpouring of anti-immigrant hatred that has swelled as Germany struggles to absorb the nearly one million asylum seekers who arrived in the country after Chancellor Angela Merkel decided to open the borders in 2015.That decision sharply divided Germany, with critics soon arguing that Ms. Merkel&amp;#039;s administration had lost control of the situation.

&gt; A thriving industrial hub in the 19th century, Chemnitz was badly damaged during World War II, then rebuilt as a model socialist city under East Germany&amp;#039;s Communist regime and temporarily renamed Karl-Marx-Town.The 7-meter-tall bronze head of Marx in the city center was once a rallying point for demonstrations that took place each Monday to demand the end of Communism; this week it was the rallying point of the far right.

&gt; &amp;quot;We have a strong neo-Nazi scene in eastern Germany, but we also have a strong current of far-right extremism in all of Germany - not just in Parliament but in society,&amp;quot; said Matthias Quent, who runs an institute that studies democracy and civil society in the eastern state of Thuringia.

## Os ""entãosistas” não pretendem que as suas ideias sejam mais úteis ou verdadeiras, mais libertadoras, mais instrutivas ou mais honestas. Pretendem apenas desviar o assunto daquilo que mais os incomoda.

Imaginem que se escreve sobre Orbán. Razões não faltam. Orbán manda cessar a alimentação dos requerentes de asilo de forma a que a fome os impeça de usarem o seu direito de recurso nas decisões judiciais que os afetam. A Universidade da Europa Central, em Budapeste, vê-se forçada a suspender todos os programas com refugiados por causa da nova lei húngara que pune com impostos extorsionários as organizações que ajudem refugiados, incluindo com assistência jurídica. Para completar, Orbán vai a Itália e promove a exportação das suas táticas para violar os valores com que o seu governo se comprometeu através dos tratados europeus.

A resposta não se faz esperar: “então e quando escreves sobre Nicolás Maduro e o desastre em que se tornou a Venezuela?”. Um tipo lá assinala que já escreveu (e voltará a escrever) sobre Nicolás Maduro e o desastre, aliás mais do que anunciado e doloso, em que Maduro e Chávez antes dele transformaram a Venezuela. Poderia até dizer que já não são de hoje os avisos sobre a demagogia, o autoritarismo e culto da personalidade que na Venezuela não poderiam deixar de dar em desastre — porque dão sempre em desastre (no meu caso poderia até acrescentar a autoria e a aprovação de resoluções condenando as violações de direitos humanos na Venezuela ou defendendo as liberdades políticas no país). Mal o faça, porém, célere vem o desafio: “então e os crimes do capitalismo? quando é que vão ser denunciados, julgados e condenados os crimes do capitalismo?”.

Boa pergunta. Antes de respondermos a essa, lá virá alguém com: “então os crimes do socialismo?”. E logo depois “então e os crimes do catolicismo?”. Não, espera, antes haveria que responder a “então e os crimes dos islamistas?”. E por aí adiante.

Se às vezes parece que boa parte daquilo que passa por debate público, na imprensa e nas redes sociais, é uma repetição infindável deste esquema — é porque é verdade. Em inglês há uma palavra para isto: o *whataboutism*. A wikipédia define o *whataboutism* como “uma variante dos argumentos *tu quoque*”, da expressão latina que significa “tu também”. Diz a wikipédia que o *whataboutism* é praticamente uma “ideologia nacional na Rússia de Putin”, que no entanto já tinha sido desenvolvida na União Soviética, onde a réplica “e na vossa terra há linchamentos de negros” era uma resposta corrente — tanto mais eficaz quanto verdadeira, diga-se — a qualquer crítica dos EUA à trágica situação das liberdades na URSS. Se assim é, a disseminação generalizada do *whataboutism* no comentário público e nas redes sociais é uma prova do triunfo metodológico de Putin. Digo metodológico, e não ideológico. Pode não haver muita gente a querer viver como na Rússia de Putin, mas não há praticamente recanto no espaço público que não esteja dominado pela sua forma de discutir.

E esse é precisamente o objetivo daquilo que decidi traduzir em português por “entãosismo”. Os ""entãosistas” não pretendem que as suas ideias sejam mais úteis ou verdadeiras, mais libertadoras, mais instrutivas ou mais honestas. Pretendem apenas desviar o assunto daquilo que mais os incomoda: que alguém tenha o topete de chamar a atenção para os crimes e as violações de direitos humanos que são levados a cabo pelos seus ídolos políticos.

Com isso perverte-se e corrompe-se uma bela palavra. Sim, porque é útil e importante iniciar uma pergunta com “então e?” e é bom fazê-lo para desmascarar um hipócrita. Mas quando o debate é só isso, enfim, os “entãosistas” logram uma vitória tática às custas de um fracasso intelectual e moral — deles e para nós todos.

É possível ser-se conservador, liberal ou socialista e ser-se decente, honesto e inteligente. Vou mais longe mesmo e direi que é por serem decentes, honestas e inteligentes que a maior parte das pessoas de quem discordo pensam como pensam — e ainda bem. Mas não é possível ser um “entãosista” e ser-se intelectualmente honesto.

False,Fiveos2,1473650961.0,,mon,[],,Monarchist,dark,text,t2_11ckr8,"1) why would you ask us this? it is clear that media and advertisements are obsessed with normalizing mixed race couples...and show it far more often than what realistically occurs, and far more often than people want them to. So what is THEIR motivation for doing this? Clearly they don't think marriage is all about love like you do. But what DO they think it is?

there are very real genetic consequences to a white person having a child with a non white person. Genetics are things that exist in the real world...they are not some ephemeral concept like love. If you have the genes to dive 200 feet like the bajou, then you can dive 200 feet. If you mix the bajou with some outside genes who do not have such genes, the offspring will NOT be able to dive 200 feet. This is tangible consequence.

2) Jews are distinct culturally moreso than genetically...and indeed many white gentiles who have been raised on jewish entertainment and jewish education have essentially become 'honorary jews'. 'caucasian' is a term limited to genetic categories if humans are split into five groups...and it results in middle eastern and north African populations being the same as European populations...but this seems not very useful as a scientific category because their history is so starkly different. If European genetics have been influenced by their distinct history, then splitting human genetic population into more than 5 groups is necessary to take note of that difference.

3) I don't really deny the holocaust...but nothing would be totally irrational about questioning your source for the shrinking jewish population. One thing we do know is that there have been many lies about the holocaust on both sides of the debate. Another thing we know is that many questions about the holocaust are illegal to ask...and in such a hostile environment we should not expect that truth is what wins out in popular opinion.

And yet she can apparently make claims like this, directly from the linked article:

&gt; If Britain loses its access to the EU single market for services, the competitiveness of its largest sector – along with 80% of UK jobs – will be at risk.

Firstly, there is no chance whatsoever, none, zero that every service industry would lose access to all customers elsewhere in the EU under any Brexit scenario, even no deal. No-one is going to abolish copyrights or stop designing new products because of Brexit, for example. For a start, the EU couldn't do those things without violating much wider international agreements to which it (or its member states) is a party, with rapid and devastating economic consequences.

Secondly, even if we could somehow lose all access to all EU services markets, there would *still* be no chance that every job in the entire UK services sector would be at risk. Walking to places within a quarter-mile of my house, I go past signs for:

- a GP surgery
- a dental practice
- various other health and care providers such as professional therapists
- multiple schools and other academic institutions
- several hairdressers and beauty salons
- a funeral director
- multiple gyms
- numerous shops, numerous restaurants, cafes and takeaways
- a furniture repair place
- a couple of motor vehicle garages and a bike repair place
- numerous small professional firms (lawyers, accountants, IT places, marketing agencies)
- a couple of small private hire/taxi drivers and a car/van rental place
- several private teachers for musical instruments, yoga and other hobbies
- a few different builders and other trades.

Presumably all of the associated jobs are among the 80% of our economy that represents the services sector, so apparently this person thinks they could all be lost because of Brexit. I don't believe her. About 5/6 of our economy is domestic production and consumption, and of the remaining 1/6, about half (depending on exactly what you're measuring) is trade with the EU and the other half is trade with the rest of the world. It's certainly possible that Brexit will do significant economic damage, particularly in the immediate aftermath of actually leaving, and particularly if there's no deal or only a very basic one, but even trade with the entire EU isn't *that* important to our economy.",True,False,True,comment score below threshold,0,1535845411,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e58mzbt,False,t3_9c4jic,True,t1_e587h4m,/r/ukpolitics/comments/9c4jic/ngaire_woods_prof_of_global_economic_governance/e58mzbt/,,1538570920,-14,True,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,r/ukpolitics,public,,

No es misión del sistema capitalista fomentar el pensamiento crítico,hacer que la gente piense,sino estupidizarla en una sociedad consumista y en la Argentina ello se  lleva acabo exitosamente para la clase dominante oligárquico-financista.

Los argentinos son emotivos, temperamentales por naturaleza,vaya a saber si en buena medida por su herencia latina como descendientes de italianos y españoles.

En el siglo pasado y sobre todo entre los años 30 a 40, la Argentina era un país con una economía primaria (agropecuaria) y dependiente del mercado inglés, gobernado por los hijos de una oligarquía vacuna (la llamada “década infame” ) que vivía de la renta de la tierra y de la explotación de peonadas (hombres y mujeres) en sus enormes  estancias.

El cierre de abastecimientos industriales por causa de la guerra, promovió una incipiente industrialización(sustitución de importaciones).

Sobre la base de enormes ganancias obtenidas durante el conflicto por proveer de alimentos a los países involucrados, el peronismo triunfante  intensificó el desarrollo de esa industrialización(muchas veces basada en subvenciones)a la que acompañó la urbanización y  proletarización de millones de ex trabajadores del campo (o simplemente desocupados).

(Cualquier semejanza con la España de los 60 es pura coincidencia )

De la misma manera que el estado de bienestar europeo fué producto de enormes ganancias obtenidas de la explotación sobre todos  de Africa y demás colonias, países semicoloniales y  dependientes, el enorme colchón de divisas y la necesidad de alimentar el funcionamiento de las fábricas, permitió a los argentinos disfrutar de su temporal **estado de bienestar**.

Duró tres o cuatro años y  finalizó cuando-terminada la guerra- la producción de los grandes centros industriales mundiales volvió a abastecer los mercados  a precios inferiores a los de la producción nacional incluso subsidiada.

Perón cayó en 1955 en medio de una crisis que habia comenzado algunos años antes, y de la disputa por el predominio mundial  entre el declinante imperio  británicos y el pujante  triunfador  de la guerra:los EEUU.

Argentina siempre había sido una rutilante estrella en la constelación del firmamento inglés. 

Entre los años 1955 (derrota de Perón) y el gobierno de Néstor Kirchner ,la Argentina ha vivido cincuenta años  entre golpes militares, con escasos períodos de estabilidad económico-social.

Frondizi; Illia; Perón; Isabel su mujer; Alfonsín; Menem; Néstor Kirchner y Cristina Fernández (seis o siete en 50 años) han sido los presidentes civiles entre unos cuantos militares y algún civil en períodos  que raramente superaron  el año. 

Los años en que gobernaron los militares fueron de represión, pero no solamente porque el pueblo luchaba por  restablecer la democracia, sino por las duras condiciones en que vivían las clases populares.

Y en los años  que gobernaron los civiles, esas mismas clases no vieron mejorar sus niveles de vida y trabajo sino que fueron y se sintieron  traicionadas en sus expectativas, por los políticos a quienes habian votado con entusiasmo y esperanza.

Es que siempre las decepciones son directamente proporcionales a las ilusiones ;y las ilusiones de este pueblo temperamental siempre fueron grandes.

Menem es el caso más típico de esta grave  desilusión.

Este hombre (peronista y torturado por la dictadura)  privatizó todo lo que tuvo a mano. 

Entre estas empresas nada menos que YPF(petróleo);Gas del Estado; Aerolíneas Argentinas; etc. , y hasta el Correo Argentino   que cayó en manos de los Macri.

Además estableció lo que llamó  “relaciones carnales” con los EEUU haciendo que el peso equivaliera al dólar ,abriendo  el mercado argentino a las multinacionales (libre importación frente a una industria débil) , subordinando la economía argentina a la norteamericana con el resultado conocido:desastre total y fin en el “corralito”.

 El recuerdo de la  época peronista de las vacas gordas  ha quedado fijado en la mente de los argentinos más allá de la generación que la vivió y explica-en buena medida- el éxito de los gobiernos de los Kirchner ,peronistas de nuevo cuño.

Durante sus mandatos se vivió una época en en la que  fueron muy altos los precios de los productos que el país exportaba.

También en esta época la burguesía argentina hizo buenas ganancias, lo que permitió recuperar beneficios sociales desaparecidos(“Tiburón que se baña, salpica” dicen los cubanos).

Ninguno de los gobiernos argentinos tocó las bases del poder de la clase dominante.

Ni se hizo una reforma agraria;ni se nacionalizó el comercio exterior y la banca extranjera siguió siendo la dueña del mercado.

La misma villa miseria que hace 50 años  se extendía a lo largo de  vías ferroviarias que conducen a estación Retiro,no solamente sigue allí,sino que ha adquirido- casi- categoría de ciudad, alargándose sobre la Gral Paz y ostentando orgullosamente la denominación de ""Villa 31"",con una población de 40.000 habitantes.

Y es una de las siete en Buenos Aires capital. 

                   --------------------------------------
La esperanza es connatural a la raza humana.

No se puede vivir sin ella, aunque penda de  un delicado hilo.

Esperanza en una satisfactoria  vida ultraterrena,o  en la mejoría de las actuales condiciones en ésta..

Y la esperanza en una vida mejor para sí, para  la familia y para  la sociedad es tanto más fuerte cuanto peor se vive.

Por algo proliferan las iglesias y las sectas en donde se va a rezar para compensar en el más allá la miseria de este mundo,  y también para que la deidad - en cuanto le sea posible- nos conceda la gracia de mejorar nuestra existencia en este valle de lágrimas .

Las peregrinaciones en Argentina  a la iglesia de la  Virgen del Pilar, a las de San Cayetano y San José Obrero(1º. de mayo)son multitudinarias y con el mismo fervor los apasionados argentinos se han entregado a los modernos apóstoles políticos cuyas efigies queman al sentirse defraudados, traicionados.

Pero necesitados de esperanza y para poder vivir, vuelven a creer…

Us kiwis are very easy going...  

however because of this 'easy going nature' when people are very direct (such as a lot of Europeans are) then some kiwis can get offended because they 'interpret' that person as coming across strong, forceful or arrogant.. 

For example, if the kiwi themself had said something as directly as what was just said to them, it would be they had a big 'issue' with that thing;  so when someone says something 'directly' to them, it comes across as if the person saying it has a 'problem' with it.

In shocking scenes, caught on camera, Neymar is seen holding the YOUNG CHILD in a Brazilian death grip, forcing the child's hands around his ample waist. The BABY BOY - at this point in tears - holds on, clearly in fear for his life. 

The £200M footballer who lives in a £20M, 8 bedroom house in Paris and employs 3 maids with heaving breasts then begins to mock and belittle him by removing his own shirt, and forcing it into the potentially orphaned child's hands. 

The potentially orphaned child, who could recently have been diagnosed with leukemia, continues to sob uncontrollably as Neymar picks him up and hurls him back into the stands, as horrified stewards watch on.

Pals spoke to The Sun to say that he has never done anything like this before, but one unnamed source confirmed he does this kind of thing all the time. 

Colin, from Kent, said 'I haven't seen it but it sounds disgraceful. He should be banned from football and from the UK. If these are the everyday actions of Europeans then we don't need them in this country.'

This piece is of Queen María Luisa of Parma (1789) in her court dress by Fansisco Goya - she was the queen of Spain by marriage and actually had a very interesting life.

She married to become Queen to her cousin, the firstborn son of the King of Spain, but only because there was no queen at the time so she just kind of got the position. Whe got a great education, but was too frivolous and impulsive to really capitalize on it. She was said to be ""intelligent, ambitious and dominant"" - her husband was way more interested in hunting and mechanics than state affairs, and to the anger if her father-in-law (the current king) she became *very* involved.

In fact when her husband became king, she attended the first meeting he had with his ministers, which was completely unheard of. She attended every meeting. Her favorite guard kept getting promoted, and actually was placed as prime minister. She kept dipping her hand into everything. People - royals and otherwise - did *not* like her. She was accused of poisoning two princesses, having tens of affairs, including the prime minister (yep, that guard), and of being far too involved in political affairs - she had a mob trying to kill her at one point. And it all came to a head when Napolean showed up.

Yes, *that* Napolean. You see, a very unpopular treaty with France happened in 1808, and her husband, due to riots, gave up the throne to his son. María (and the king) weren't very happy about this so she joined him with a meeting of the four of them to talk about it and try to appeal it. Napoleon hears that request and is like ""You know, I hear ya, but what about this - MY brother is the king instead?"" And her husband's like ""no"" and she's like ""no"" and their son, the current king, is like ""...what? No!"" And Napoleon's like ""but what if...I'm forcing you?"" And here comes the French army. Aaaaaand now Napoleon's brother is king. And now the people are pissed.

Of course of all the people blamed for  it is María. Not Napolean, the king, or her son, it was María that showed up on angry panflets at the time. The reasoning wasn't bad - she was one of the supporters of the initial, deeply unpopular treaty. She WAS part of the reason Naoplean wiggled in in the first place. So she goes from princess to prisoner. Actually, all three of them do, and her proported side piece, the prime minister, as well. And when Napolean falls, her son, who becomes king again, bans her, her husband, and the prime minister from Spain anyway.

That’s also why our dairy industry is managed: it’s a very capital intensive farming operation.

It costs money to transport all that supply to places where there’s not a huge customer base to support it. So, when prices go sideways, guess who isn’t getting served? 

Part of the reason why Canada is scattered as much as it is, is because in my grandparents lifetimes, we gave large tracts of land to people in the middle of nowhere to settle.

And despite your extreme beliefs in Social Darwinism, climate change will be a permanent, devastating blow that humanity, at least at its current industrial and technological capacity, cannot recover from. A significant percentage of the human population lives near the coasts, all the infrastructure created near the coasts would end up underwater, New York? gone! Miami? gone! The Netherlands? gone! With these cities goes the technical knowledge of all it's inhabitants as well as the infrastructure they contain that maintains an interconnected modern world. **Every** port used for shipping goods between continents would end up submerged and unusable. Underwater internet cables would become almost impossible to maintain and may even cease to function when their endpoints are also underwater. Satellite internet will also become unmanageable because access to space, at least for the United States and Europe, will be submerged. Almost all launch sites are built with a coast to the east. Satellites will become unmanageable before we can rebuild them and by the time we finish, the coasts will wash over everything we have done.

Climate change doesn't just affect sea levels. It also messes with our food supply. The dust bowl of the 1930's devastated the Midwestern US and made the great depression even worse. Climate change threatens us with a permanent and more severe dust bowl than the 30's. Man made pollution also threatens pollinating insects who we rely on for many of our crops to grow. The carrying capacity of the land will be drastically reduced by climate change.

The last, most damning nail in the coffin of humanity, will be the lack of easily accessible resources. When billions are forced to migrate away from the coast, and food supply is drastically reduced, societal order will most likely collapse. If humanity is not killed completely in the chaos, it could never recover to our modern level. In the 1600's, when Britain was first industrializing, There were minerals such as iron and coal easily accessible on cliff faces by the shore. Oil could be discovered seeping up out of the soil before it became a cheap power source for humanity. Since then the coal and iron have been stripped away and the oil has been pumped. We have either burned them, or refined them into different materials. We now rely on extremely deep mines and sophisticated techniques such as fracking to sustain ourselves. Techniques which could not be achieved with the technology of the early industrial revolution.

A non-Euro option would be a TSX Wagon. Super hard to find though. Plenty of VW options that are much more common in your price range.

Trump suggests remove troops and military funds from Europe since their economy is larger than ours and they can defend themselves; democrats oppose.

Trump suggests defunding or leaving the antiquated NATO agreement andthe UN military forces, which are more used as justification for the US to invade tiny non threatening brown nations than for actual defense; democrats oppose.

Suggest that we remove our troops from Japan which are only costing us tons of money, and escalating tensions with China. Japan has one of the strongest economies on the planet, so they could arm themselves if they want to; democrats oppose.

Suggests that the US remove some troops and weapon systems from South Korea; democrats oppose.

Suggest that we end our proxy war with Russia in Syria. The war which we are involved in for no good reason which has killed hundreds of thousands of innocent people and has caused a massive and unprecedented refuee crisis. Suggests that we enter peace talks with Russia to end it; democrats oppose. 

Trump proposes we limit arms sales and funding which many countries use for their millitary. Most recently Pakistan; democrats oppose.

Suggests that we actually try to talk with North korea rather than continue the unsuccessful multi decade silent treatment; democrats oppose.

I dont even like trump, but its clear as day. The Democratic party has effectively reduced themselves to being defined by nothing but ""anti-Trumpism"".

Such whataboutism. So the only defense is that Trump is worse? Those standards are about as high as Trumps approval rating (pretty low).

Absolute horrid night at the office for EPL. The results were not what I expected, with Crystal palace losing 0-2 to Southampton which surprised me. The other games were as expected but very low scoring games or games that did not meet my punting targets. 

&amp;#x200B;

Putting yesterday past us, we go again before the international break. 

**Cardiff vs Arsenal BTTS @1.77 -1u** 

Cardiff have not scored in 3 game in their EPL campaign, they will look to score at home to get their much needed 3 points. Arsenal showed moments of class and dominance however looked more inconsistent. They will look to get 3 points against Cardiff. All the other markets were not worth betting on, including straight wins on Arsenal. I do see Arsenal winning this match, but they will slip up in defense. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Burnley Vs Man Utd BTTS @2.03 -1u**

Absolute woeful performance at Old Trafford against Tottenham, there are alot of things I would want to rant about. But I am sure everyone on Social Media will have heard the garbage that has been thrown around in regards to Mourinho and the players. I hate to pin point players but why hasn't Lukaku been dropped? Every other player in the squad has been once dropped for their performance. I don't get why Lukaku can come out of the tunnels and not deliver anything. 

A game away from home is a must win for Man Utd, Burnley are out of the European tour, so they will look to concentrate to getting back into retaining a spot for Europa league or higher next season. So far burnley and Man Utd have been poor in defense, both side lack the clean and simple defensive system that most top clubs have in the EPL. With Champions League coming soon, Man Utd will have a more complex schedule moving forward. I feel like alot of players will be used rotating between competitions. De Gea will look to be playing all the games for Man Utd, he hasn't played this year and it is not his fault goals are going in either. 

Both teams will score tonight, inconsistency in defense kills any team whether if you are Real Madrid or Arsenal. 

&amp;#x200B;

These are the questions that I have fans and punters?

* Will Mourinho be sacked if they lose to Burnley tonight?
* Martial has not signed a contract extension but is included tonight for Burnley's match. Is the Manager and Martial's relationship really that bad?
* If it is bad, why is Martial playing, when there are so many options out there for the mid field?
* Rashford is a number 10, why is he not starting consistently?
* Lukaku or Ibrahimovic? 

**Watford vs Tottenham BTTS @1.70 -1u**

Good that Sonny is coming back to London! 

This game is going to produce alot of goals. There is so much attacking power on both sides, Kane, Lucas Moura, Ali, Erikson, Deeney, Gray, Pereyra, Hughs. You name it. Lloris is out so that is a big advantage to punters if we were to go BTTS. With odds being the same as Total goals 2.5, i think it is much safer in my opinion going BTTS.

GL to all, DYOR, see you all after the international break.

&gt;  
&gt;Google declined an invitation from the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to have CEO Sundar Pichai testify on Russia's meddling in the 2016 election.  
&gt;  
&gt;Google has largely avoided the recent controversies surrounding other tech platforms by letting Facebook and Twitter absorb all the public scrutiny.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Senate and the public deserve to hear from Google's top leadership, not its lawyers, about what went wrong and how the company plans to make things better.  
&gt;  
&gt;Steve Kovach	| @stevekovach  
&gt;  
&gt;Published 18 Hours Ago Updated 15 Hours AgoCNBC.com  
&gt;  
&gt;Beck Diefenbach | Reuters  
&gt;  
&gt;Google CEO Sundar Pichai takes the stage during the presentation of new Google hardware in San Francisco on Oct. 4, 2016.  
&gt;  
&gt;When the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence holds its next hearing on Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, it will hear from two of the top executives in the tech industry: Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg.  
&gt;  
&gt;Beside them on Wednesday could be an empty seat that's reserved for another high-profile leader. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has so far refused to accept the Senate committee's invitation to show up.  
&gt;  
&gt;Instead of Pichai, Google offered its top lawyer, Kent Walker, to testify. Walker, the senior vice president of global affairs, is the same guy who previously testified along with Facebook and Twitter's lawyers last year, which was a meek effort from all three companies at a time when Congress and the public deserved to hear from top leadership about how their platforms were so badly abused ahead of the elections.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Chances are there's going to be an empty chair there,"" Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va, told CNBC Wednesday, regarding Google's snub of the hearings. ""And I think there will be a lot more questions raised that could have been actually dealt with if they sent a senior decision-maker and not simply their counsel.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Warner is the vice chair of the Senate committee.  
&gt;  
&gt;Google has not said why Pichai or his boss, Alphabet CEO Larry Page, won't accept the committee's invitation. The company declined to comment Friday.  
&gt;  
&gt;It's a tumultuous time for the world's biggest tech companies, with Facebook taking most of the heat following the reveal of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal in March.  
&gt;  
&gt;Since then, we've seen Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg go through two marathon sessions of weak congressional testimony. We've seen him fumble through a self-inflicted scandal about posting Holocaust denial content to the platform. We've seen him squirm when asked why Alex Jones was still allowed to post bogus conspiracy theories, only to boot Jones off Facebook after a nod from Apple a few days later. We've seen a handful of top Facebook executives, including security chief Alex Stamos, leave the company. And on and on and on.  
&gt;  
&gt;￼  
&gt;

&gt;  
&gt;Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer and founder of Facebook, speaks during a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Wednesday, April 11, 2018.  
&gt;  
&gt;It's a similar story with Dorsey, who went on a press tour during the Jones controversy a few weeks ago and has faced a relentless barrage of scrutiny in the media, on Twitter and within his own company over how he's handled moderating all the vile content and abuse that infects the site every day.  
&gt;  
&gt;But Google has largely been able to skirt the controversies plaguing its rival platforms, letting Facebook and Twitter take all the heat while its executives shy away from anything that could put them in danger of public scrutiny.  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm not talking about manufactured and false controversies from the president about anti-conservative political bias in Google's search results, by the way. (But that's sure to be a good topic for conservative senators on the committee to distract from the hearing's stated purpose of looking into election meddling.) I'm talking about how Google has let its own platforms, ranging from Google search and Google News to YouTube, become abused and perverted over the years. I'm talking about how if you think Facebook plays it fast and loose with your personal data, take a look at how Google uses the data you provide to target ads based on your location, videos you watch, your search queries and even stuff you buy with your credit card.  
&gt;  
&gt;Google also allows third parties to access your Google services, including Gmail. Cambridge Analytica and other third-party apps were able to scoop up Facebook user data with little oversight or accountability. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this summer that Google also does little to police third parties that have access to users' Gmail accounts and their data. Plus, a few weeks ago Google admitted that some of its services can track your location, even if you selected to turn off location tracking.  
&gt;  
&gt;Free pass  
&gt;  
&gt;And yet, Google is getting a pass. Facebook and Twitter have been wildly inconsistent and confusing in their responses to various scandals, but at least they're taking their shots in full public view. Google would rather send Walker to spew a bunch of legalese than hold its own leaders accountable, just like it did last year.  
&gt;  
&gt;Even more frustrating is the fact that Google's business appears to be immune to any controversy, giving leadership and investors zero economic incentive to own up to its issues. Google has a series of impenetrable moats around its business — it's the dominant search engine, has the top streaming video site, the most popular web browser, the most popular email service and makes the operating system that powers practically every non-Apple phone on the planet.  
&gt;  
&gt;Because of all that, Alphabet is healthier than ever, reporting close to $33 billion in revenue last quarter. Even the European Union's record $5 billion Android antitrust fine against Google was nothing more than a financial blip for the company, and will do little to stop its dominance in mobile. Google's stock, meanwhile, keeps climbing.  
&gt;  
&gt;But those are also the very reasons Google should send Pichai to testify on Wednesday.  
&gt;  
&gt;It's because Google is so big. It's because it has built so many moats around its businesses. It's because it needs personal data from users to make its billions. It's because it built a suite of powerful platforms ripe for abuse from Russia and Iran. That's what makes it so offensive that Google won't take its responsibility seriously enough to put its leader in front of the Senate and explain how it's going to do better.  
&gt;  
&gt;Google should be examined in exactly the same way Facebook and Twitter will be on Wednesday.  
&gt;  
&gt;But instead the company will keep its CEO in Mountain View while his peers are in Washington. And that's an insult to the rest of us.

English is the language of the most powerful country and for awhile after world war 2 it was far and away the people you had to do business with if you didn’t want to deal with communist since most of Europe was busy rebuilding. China was also still largely isolationist. So the person who knew English had an edge over the one who didn’t. Even after the rebuilding the trend stuck because it made since to have a common language to do business in and English was already being used. The rest of the world went the same way because a large number of people from other nations already spoke it. This spiraled out to a lot of ordinary people. It’s like hey if I learn this 1 language I’m set if I want to do business and I can travel to most any other country and communicate with people. 
So yes it is pretty pointless for an English speaker to learn a second language. That 2nd language is only going to come in handy in a few places.

By a tiny, tiny amount. On the flip side, immigrants represent a high proportion of our builders; reducing immigration will make it harder for us to build more houses than we are now, which we need to do to solve the housing problem.

Barely. There are better ways to push up wages at the low end of the curve, and without damaging our economy (which stands to have a far greater negative effect on your wallet).

False,c_delta,1452979193.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_tuug2,"""The goal of socialism is communism"" is actually pretty much the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism. The idea that to transition to the communism Marx envisioned, a world without a need for property and authority, a somewhat dictatorial government would be needed as an interim solution. Such a government, staffed by people who follow the communist ideology, would have a strong hand in economic affairs and manage the communal property, ensuring that workers are productive and fed. Since such a strong authority is not compatible with the eventual goal of Marxian communism, they adopted a different term, ""socialism"" (compare ""Communist Party of the Soviet Union"" to ""Union of Socialist Soviet Republics"").

That said, the term ""socialism"" has gotten a lot broader since then. Many parties that once advocated for revolutions like the one in Russia have since turned away from Bolshevism and shifted their focus towards improving social security within a market economy after seeing how tyrannical and destitute the soviet-aligned world had become. Some kept the socialist label, some added ""democratic"" to the socialism to distance themselves from the communist parties of eastern Europe and Asia, some chose the term ""social democrat"" instead (the biggest German left-wing party has used the term since 1869; they would keep Marxist ideology in their manifesto for 90 more years, but not push for a revolution when they could improve conditions for the working class through bipartisan means).

So bottom line, the term ""socialism"" spans an incredibly wide range all the way from Marxism-Leninism (which aspires communism while embracing authoritarianism) all the way to social democracy (which merely defines one of the core tasks of the state as helping those who cannot help themselves and does not aspire communism).

26 factories under construction with capacities be in excess of a GWh per year

&gt;There are 26 battery ""megafactories"" that are either in production and due to expand capacity or new operations due to be in production by 2021, Benchmark said in a blog post on Monday. Benchmark coined the term ""megafactory"" to describe factories that produce more than 1 gigawatt-hour of total capacity in a single year.

&gt;China is still by far the dominant force in the industry with 49% of planned capacity totalling 169 GWh, the most recently added Chinese megafactory to the tracker was number 24, Great Power’s planned 10GWh plant in Guangzhou. Following China is the EU, totalling 23% of planned capacity or 78.5GWh. Prior to 2017, the EU was falling far behind the rest of the world, with just one plant planned by LG Chem in Poland with 5GWh capacity. The acceleration of activity in the European market was driven by two facilities – TerraE’s 34GWh facility in Germany and Northvolt’s 32GWh offering in Sweden. Europe is also the home for megafactory number 25, SK Innovations plant in Hungary with a capacity of 7.5 GWh. Whilst the US is third on the list, with 53GWh and 15% of capacity it is worth noting that Tesla has further expansions planned for the Gigafactory beyond 2021 and have stated publicly that they expect to be able to achieve 150GWh out of the plant, no small feat as they get to grips with the mass market scale of production of the Model 3.

The majority of those are between 10 and 55 GWh per year, Reno GF1 is currently producing at a rate of 35 to 40GWh per year, and on schedule to to hit 60 to 80 GWh per year by end of next year, the Tesla Shanghai plant (GF3) will be at 40-50 GWh per year.

Which puts total at between 450 and 492 GWh per year (yes, I rounded to 500)

EV battery cell density today is 250 Wh per kg, it was 160 Wh per kg 4 years ago.  Solid electrolyte  lithium batteries are at 400-500 Wh per kg and being released in less than 5 years, lithium Sulfur batteries are at 800 Wh per kg and batteries suitable for EVs are 8 years out.  At 280 Wh per kg, advanced EV batteries today are at 4 percent theoretical maximum for electro chemical battery storage.

Could you give me a good source to read up on Russian history? What I know is that you had a royal family (the Tsars) until social unrest reached a boiling point and the Russians 'traded' royalty for communism. After the USSR fell apart Russia became a democracy. 

What I would like to know more about is how the Russian people perceived communism, at first and how was it seen after a few decades? Did they welcome it or did they want to hang on to the royal family? Or did they not care at all as life was already difficult enough without having to worey about politics? 
And how did they feel about Soviet states separating? How did Russians feel about Jeltsin deciding to end the wall and conceding? I remember here we believed world peace was at hand the moment the Berlin wall was torn down. That how the nineties felt for me. 

How did the change from communism to democracy affect the Russians? I have read up a bit on this transition in former Soviet states that are now part of Europe, and know that its been far from easy, and it takes a very long time until a certain mindset is changed in a people. 
I am curious on how this is Russia.

Close enough, sou português. :p

&gt; That is the part that disturbs me most: maybe we don't have the God we wished to have. Good people dying, prayer doesn't working... if its all about living with Jesus, you should accept every tragedy but be joyful about Jesus living at your side. To be Christian is to accept the good and the bad, knowing that you are not alone... and all the pleasures or sufferings of this life are finite. 

Eu compreendo que ser Cristão é aceitar o mundo como ele é e ter fé que não estamos sós, que Deus quer o melhor para nós. Mas por isso é que eu insisto que se estude a história da igreja. Pois é a igreja que nos ensina que temos de ter fé na sua doutrina. Mas se estudares a história da Igreja vais começar a questionar-te se essa instituição merece que se tenha fé nela. E por ""questionar-te"" não quer dizer que venhas a chegar à mesma conclusão que eu. É bom questionarmo-nos e mantermos a mente aberta.

&gt; Its worth praising a God through Jesus and through repenting if this is the will of God. Maybe God doesn't consider your happiness much for the masterplan, but the rules are still valid: you have to bow down before him, love him, no matter what... This is what is making me suffer most: all can be a test and God likes to be praised... if he is the Creator, we are in debt and we are his workers, better do things his way.

Tens razão. Se ele é o Criador, estamos de certa forma a dever-lhe, literalmente, a nossa existência. E não tenho qualquer problema com isso. Mas não sei quem é o meu criador. O Deus Abraamico? Shiva? Outro Deus que não conseguimos sequer conceber? Uma reacção química sem consciência?

&gt; As for the corrupted priests and parts of Catholic church, I would answer that the fault goes on the humans. People that failed to deny themselves, and priest or not, will have damnation in the end because their true intent is not the one desired by God. Its all about you with yourself, and churches are not good parameters sometimes, but you should hang on the Bible, not on the human choices of the ones of the church.

Podes assumir que a culpa é dos humanos que são falíveis, ao passo que Deus não o é. Mas ao assumires essa posição não podes acreditar num Deus que tenha poderes para intervir na nossa vida, o que coloca as histórias da Bíblia em cheque. Se um Deus não decide intervir para parar com as anormalidades da sua maior igreja de estar constantemente a sujar o Seu nome por causa de uma pequena minoria de ""homens de Deus"" que só fazem porcarias (sim, eu reconheço obviamente que a maior parte dos católicos são boas pessoas), então ele não deve ter o poder intervir na vida das pessoas.

&gt; I honestly don't know what to do to go off my existential crisis. May I ask you if you are happy now (be honest with me)?

Se sou feliz? Há coisas na minha vida que quero mudar, mas estou a trabalhar para ser feliz. Todos nós procuramos o sentido na vida. Isto parece tudo tão irreal quando pensamos nisto. Qual é o sentido de crescermos, multiplicarmo-nos e morrermos? Se calhar não tem de haver um sentido inato. Eu acho que os seres humanos não são mais do que uma máquina complexa que tem consciência. E é nessa consciência que acho que se encontra a chave da nossa humanidade. A nossa razão de ser. Entristece-me a ideia de que um dia deixarei de ser consciente, mas nunca deixarei de ser. Sou composto de células vivas que hão-de continuar a sua viagem pelo universo muito depois de eu bater a bota. E isso faz-me sorrir de certa forma. Respondendo, por fim, acho que posso ser verdadeiramente feliz apesar de ainda não o ser. Mas sei que isso não depende da minha concepção sobre a vida e a morte nem sobre a existência de algo consciente maior do que eu (um deus supremo ou outras divindades).

- The wealth gap between the 1% and 99% is higher than ever
- No government since the 1999 democrats has had a surplus.  They caused the 2008 recession and then spent trillions of dollars trying to limp on ever since.
- Their continual divestment from education at all levels is resulting in adults who are less and less capable to hold STEM careers resulting in less and less economic output which is why immigration of STEM educated people is valued.

But ya, they'll be fine...

&gt; Care e problema? De ce protestăm? În comunităţile de români din străinătate se afirmă personaje cu clare simpatii legionare, rasişti, naţionalişti. Am văzut destui, gata să îşi verse opiniile de îndată ce scapă de “chingile corectitudinii politice”. Astfel de personaje organizează proteste, scriu scrisori dramatice şi fac presiuni asupra consulilor şi ambasadorilor pentru reacţii oficiale. Consulii şi ambasadorul român din Anglia s-au arătat ofensaţi de un documentar umanizant, care arăta greutăţile unor emigranţi, fără stereotipuri, fără regie. Protestatarii din faţa Channel 4 vor să demonstreze “că suntem altfel decât prezintă ei”: reuşesc să arate că diaspora românâ e plină de naţionalişti ridicoli.

To date, no transnational terrorist attack, linked to al-Qa'ida or an affiliate, has been carried out on German soil. **This is due above all to the vigilance of the German security services, who in many cases have intervened early and prevented terrorist groups from carrying out their plans.** *A number of German nationals have, however, continued to be victims of terrorist attacks in other countries.* **It must be assumed that unidentified terrorist networks or cells exist in Germany that are integrated into functioning cross-border structures and, to a large degree, can plan attacks independently based on their capabilities and the means available.** Germany also faces the possible growing threat of “lone wolf” Islamist extremists, lured by al-Qa`ida’s violent ideology yet having no connection to organized terrorist cells. These individuals hope to contribute to the “jihad” with smaller-scale, retaliatory efforts—similar to the action taken by Arid Uka in March 2011.

&gt;These cases demonstrate that jihadist activity in Germany is becoming more lethal. In the past, German territory was used by Islamist militants strictly to plan terrorist operations abroad.

False,Wabisabi_Wasabi,1478519805.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_12njph,"My PoV at the moment is that UK migration can basically be seen in about three eras:

1) 1970-1997: Relatively low immigration, mostly Commonwealth. Few Europeans come, because, despite FoM, relatively rich Western Europeans in growing economies didn't have much incentive. Cultural effects of migration are large, but the actual change in the population is relatively small, and political unrest and anger driven by migration is fairly low by present day standards.

2) 1997-2010: New Labour, New Nation: Labour party really opens the floodgates on student migration, low skill migration and high skill migration, from all over the world (probably mostly because of their ideology - ""*rub the Right's nose in diversity*"" - Andrew Neather). We also see Blair's government decide not to practice any controls on migration from A8 Eastern European accession states, resulting in an even bigger influx.

Industry quickly becomes dependent on lower wage workers, and higher education's funding on the influx of students.

3) 2010 - present: The Coalition takes power, and the Home Office under May basically introduces new regulations limiting non-EU migration to students, high skill workers and family (the last under fairly punishing restrictions). This is a real change in type of migration and not just window dressing.

But the Coalition, and then Tories alone can do nothing about EU migration, and so this surges in response to a stronger recovery in Britain than much of Europe, less competition from global migration, and a fragile industry with razor thin margins quickly grown dependent in the Blair-Brown era on foreign workers who are cheap for their levels of work ethic.

So, the question is now whether the Tories will implement a new era after Brexit. They could, in theory, restrict all migration to students and high skill migrants, both from the EU and the rest of the world. To do this would challenge and probably destroy the model of employing low skill, high effort migrants en masse, which flourished post-Major, in the Blair and then Cameron era. That's gonna cost business and it's gonna be a political hit. 

But the legacy would be a Britain which would genuinely become a global skills hub while retaining more of its national character and cohesion, if its stays the course.

Eu acho que um dos motivos dos problemas de relacionamento impactarem tanto é que nós temos a impressão que conseguimos controla-los. Eu tenho vários e vários problemas, mas a vida me faz tomar um posicionamento passivo com relação a eles. São muitas coisas do tipo 'eu ligo pra isso, mas o resto das pessoas não liga, então eu sou problemático e deveria ficar calado' ou 'o que resta é esperar'. Só que quando a gente vê todo mundo vivendo relacionamentos e você não da a impressão de que você não serve pra viver.

É meio insano. Geralmente quem almeija um relacionamento muito quer uma companhia, uma pessoa que se importe consigo, que queira compartilhar do tempo, a quem possa confiar e see íntimo. Mas há pessoas que querem sexo e status, pessoas que querem alguém pra sair quando estiver entediada, pessoas ficam com outras para aumentar autoestima etc...

&gt;The near total neglect of engineering, mathematics, and other applied science education by the state contributed to a vast gap in military power between China and the European empires, as evidenced by the outcomes of the First and Second Opium Wars and the Sino–French War amongst others.

A dossier of briefing notes and memoranda shows how disquiet has grown among senior civil servants as the UK’s split with the EU in March looms closer.

The files, obtained under the freedom of information law, include a paper circulated in June by the board of NHS body National Services Scotland (NSS).

It warned that low wage growth could lead to an “enduring squeeze” on households “with an implication for economic growth”.

NSS concluded that “this could further challenge public sector funding particularly in Scotland, with devolved powers placing an increasing reliance of self-funding for health”.

The disclosure was seized upon this weekend by politicians as evidence that further tax rises may be necessary to prop up key public services in post-Brexit Scotland.

“The Tories have threatened the NHS and for the first time we have in black and white that no-deal Brexit could mean tax rises to plug the gap,” said Alistair Carmichael, the Liberal Democrat MP for Orkney and Shetland. “You cannot have a strong NHS and a hard Brexit.”

This weekend, Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, said that continued uncertainty caused by Brexit must not derail the Scottish government’s “relentless focus” on improving public services.

Speaking ahead of Tuesday’s publication of the Scottish government’s programme for the year, she said: “The people of Scotland did not vote to leave the European Union but in this parliamentary year we are set to be taken out of the EU against our will. In the face of this uncertainty, we have to intensify our focus on improving the wealth and the wellbeing of communities across Scotland.”

The Scottish government files were obtained by Best for Britain, a group fighting to keep the UK open to EU membership.

They reveal that the effect of Brexit on the UK’s participation in the European atomic energy community (Euratom) is a source of anxiety, amid warnings that shipments of medical isotopes used in scans and cancer treatment could be jeopardised and that British power stations would struggle to source nuclear fuel if it cannot be legally transported across borders.

Health officials warned a hard Brexit would “remove the guarantee of consistent and timely access to radioisotopes, potentially resulting in delays in diagnosis and cancelled operations for patients”.

The effect of tighter border controls has also vexed officials. “Highly specialised talent remains internationally mobile and any barriers to immigration will impede the recruitment of the best scientists, clinicians and technical experts, undermining our competitiveness,” warned the NSS.

Of those, the most likely opportunity for an Irish veto is ""common foreign policy"".  A lot depends on the whether the withdrawal agreement requires amendments subject to unanimity.  My intuition is that there probably won't be any because the Commission knows that it is unlikely to get the requisite unanimity at Council.  If Ireland doesn't veto it, Spain probably will.  Etc.

Even if there were, exercising that veto would produce the very thing Ireland *says* it doesn't want — and Irish farmers will not thank their politicians for deliberately acting to damage one of their principal export markets.

Title: **Inheritance from out of country**

Original Post: 

&gt; Hello. 
&gt; 
&gt; Hopefully I’m posting in the right sub, please let me know otherwise!
&gt; 
&gt; So I have this friend from Europe (won’t be too specific for obvious reasons) who  lives in America. He recently lost his last living relative from this European country and had to go back for funeral and arrangements. Now this relative’s property was left to him as part of the will and he is planning to sell it as he doesn’t travel back a lot and it’s too much work to keep up from so far away. The house, if it sells, would get him about 50-60k in US $. He’s been worried about how that will transfer over here when the time comes and is worried if it’ll be taxed etc. as he doesn’t make that much money and this would help take off the load with some things. I’ve been trying to help him find answers but there’s a lot of mixed things on the internet as usual. He doesn’t know reddit so I’m posting for him in hopes someone here would know or has some sources to read further in this.
&gt; 
&gt; Basically, will he be taxed when he sells his inheritance/property and transfers the money to the USA? It’s not a business income, it’s family property/inheritance.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance.

But I can see you want to focus on black people, so I guess you are ok with people from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia then? Nice to know you are only partially racist!

&gt; The UK doesn't have any significant number of hispanics anyway, and we can see that since they aren't hidden inside any other group in the statistics.

Dude, we are near Spain so we have lots of people with Spanish heritage. The term Hispanic as used in the USA is a total fiction that no one else uses. You guys can't even agree on a definition. Does it include Brazil or not, as an example. 

&gt; Nope, it's a huge difference. You fucked it up.

Not really, you couldn't even quote the right figures. Plus I didn't realise you were weirdly specific in your racism, I thought you hated anyone coloured or muslim. It seems you are ok with everyone except blacks. That right yeah? You love Muslims from Pakistan?


&gt; No, it is not racist. If I lie, it makes me a liar, not a racist.

If you lie to support a cause, you support that cause.

&gt; You do know Black people are from SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA, right? North Africans are muslims like libyans and egyptians and shit. Nobody calls those people black.

But let's look at what you really mean. You mean really dark people. The really blacks ones that frighten and disgust you for reasons you can't really explain. I mean, you are trying here and failing miserably.

&gt; Is Europe next to sub-saharan africa? NOPE.

Why don't you look at the nationalities of people crossing the Mediterranean? Sorry wait, I mean why don't you look at the *colour* of people crossing. I can wait.

&gt; Is Europe even ""next to"" Africa? NOPE. The fucking Mediterranean sea is in the way. America wouldn't have shit tons of illegals from Mexico if the ocean was in between us.

It is less than 8 miles from Europe to Africa by sea and of course Turkey connects it via land. People make the crossing every single day.

&gt; You didn't show shit, amateur. You cited some numbers that did not have any relevance to the topic at hand at all. 

Heh, you posted the wrong figures - see my link. Also, your entire claim is that black people are more violent than white people. So facts showing you are full of shit are more than relevant to the discussion. Malawi, which is as sub-Saharan and black as your racist heart desires, is less violent than the US *even if you excluded every black murder in the US*.

&gt; I demolished your garbage comment. 

If that helps a racist sleep, you keep thinking that. A sleeping racist isn't an active racist :)

Not sure if serious, but yes. Much more than 20%. China has seen untold numbers lifted out of poverty. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates global undernourishment has roughly halved in the last 25 years (see https://ourworldindata.org/hunger-and-undernourishment).

This unfortunately isn't that helpful if you're working class in a developed country; standards of living have arguably slid.

Digression aside, though, removing capitalism doesn't automatically lead to utopia - we survived thousands of years with feudalism and merchantilism and those were flatly worse. Some of what you're blaming on capitalism (e.g. bureaucracy in universities) is a result of large organisations, and is often much worse in a state-run system simply because the organisations are larger.

More dangerously yet, when the state runs everything, everything is political. Would you feel comfortable with the NSA running Google? It could be worse than that: Lysenkoism is blamed for famines that killed millions.

I'm in Scotland. Healthcare is free here. Medicine is free here. University is free here. I find your American politics scarily frothingly right-wing. Throwing away capitalism entirely though is madness; it seems every country that tries it becomes a dictatorship within a short space of time. You don't get progressive social democracy that way, you get authoritarianism - likely precisely because you are creating an ultimate monopoly of power in the hands of a few politicians and trusting them to use it responsibly.

I fully agree however that wealth distribution is currently all kinds of fucked up and that ""helicopter money"" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter_money) is one potentially viable means of rebalancing. Many economists who have backed it are renowned, serious figures. More than that, if you're in the US, you should seriously be investing more public money in your infrastructure, a lot of it is close to third world. But please, realise how toxic your local politics are, and don't conclude that your current implementation of capitalism is the only one and you must fight Capitalism; there are better regulated, more heavily taxed European models that would plausibly serve you far better. It's easier to find a viably non-authoritarian approach that way, moving toward other existing working solutions, and the change required is less violent.",True,False,False,,0,1535900331,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e59o381,False,t3_9c9ssh,True,t1_e59lsu8,/r/changemyview/comments/9c9ssh/cmv_the_number_1_political_issue_in_the_world/e59o381/,,1538588241,8,True,False,changemyview,t5_2w2s8,r/changemyview,public,,

DIfference in watts: 104W - 130 vs 234

That's almost double the power.

More power means more heat, more heat means more noise in order to attain lower temperatures.

Higher fan speed, also, isn't just higher noise: it's also lower longevity for the GPU fans. More dust.

More power means less overclock.

Also, it's 4$ a month if you play only 4 hrs a day, and please mind that electricity cost are very high even in Europe. 4$ a month is 50$ per year.

Fair enough.

Where things go wrong imo is when a subsidized news channel does this too, either way it is pretty nasty.

&gt;We have no socialist or democratic socialist countries in Europe, the furthest left is probably the Nordic countries who are all social democracies


Whatever label you like to slap on it, as a libertarian I consider a lot to be left wing thought which most of Europe is but this is not all that relevant, I think we can agree on this.

&gt;Again i have to disagree, i personally am very against all organized religion BUT i´m especially against Islam and i have never been ""shouted down"" for being a racist,

Thats why I used a specific politician in our country as an example, the guy never said anything that is remotely racist yet a lot of other parties tried to frame him for being so after a part member spoke about IQ in a completely unrelated case, same goes for our media. The leftier the party the louder the cries, at least in this specific case.
My point was that these dogmas cannot be discussed with any decency, this even applies to elected politicians which I find hard to accept.

&gt;absolutely that happens but i think that will happen with almost any heavily controversial issue and it isn´t just ""the left"" doing this or ""islamist"" it´s everyone everywhere again maybe these groups are worse

Certainly , of course controversial issues raise a lot of emotions which will lead many to run around screaming instead. However I think that the left is over represented in 'moral outrage', perhaps the left is over represented in general, at least where I live so this could be a logical extension.
Another point is that since they dominate the landscape they should be held responsible for the consequences that this mass immigration has brought, perhaps we have a different scope.
 
&gt;so i think it´s a nuanced issue and just a product of the modern world where everyone feels especially victimized

&gt; WARSAW - Poland belongs in the European Union but should be careful not to be &amp;quot;Infected by social diseases&amp;quot; that dominate the bloc, ruling Law and Justice party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski said on Sunday.

&gt; While underlining the need for Poland to remain inside the bloc, his party says the EU is forcing member states to conform to standards that contravene Poland&amp;#039;s traditional family values.

&gt; On Sunday, Kaczynski said EU membership was &amp;quot;The shortest way for Poland to achieve parity when it comes to living standards&amp;quot; with its western allies.

A relatively new scheme targeting businesses and credit card owners is “reshipping fraud.” Criminals operating primarily from Eastern European countries and Nigeria have been conducting widespread, international schemes involving bogus job offers, fraudulent credit card orders, and the reshipping of illegally obtained products.

The scam begins when criminals buy high-dollar merchandise — such as computers, cameras, and other electronics — via the Internet using stolen credit cards. They have the merchandise shipped to addresses in the United States of paid “reshippers” (who may be unaware they are handling stolen goods). The reshippers repackage the merchandise and mail it to locations in Russia, Ukraine, Estonia, Lithuania, Romania, and Germany. Victimized businesses include such well-known companies as Amazon, Gateway, and eBay, and other Internet auction sites.

U.S. Postal Inspectors offer these tips:

* Don’t give out personal information to a person or company you don’t know.
* Be suspicious of any offer that doesn’t pay a regular salary or involves working for an overseas company.
* Check the company with the FTC, Better Business Bureau, or state Attorney General.

Podem jogar uma valente merda mas enquando conseguirem caminhar são titulares.

e mais do que a preocupação de termos jogadores cansados e lesionados, há também o facto de jogando sempre os mesmos, semana sim semana sim, os outros pura e simplesmente não se conseguem adaptar, nem ganhar ritmo de jogo. Temos 7 jogos em mais ou menos 3 semanas e para aí 15 jogadores de 31 com minutos, \~13 que estiveram no XI inicial, e uns 7 que jogaram os 90 minutos em todos os jogos, e uma carrada de jogadores a ver jogar, depois há substituições forçadas, entra alguem que passa a epoca na bancada não tem ritmo de jogo e depois é ver os ""fãs"" 'ah não tem qualidade, por mim era vendido por 15M€ ao Nottingham"".

mas não é continuar, nem sei porque houve muito alarido na época passada por falta de jogadores e opções, correu tão bem. tanta coisa foi dita do plantel mas pelos vistos 15 chegam, 11 para jogar e 4 avançados no banco.

nem sei porque é que há tantas equipas a preocuparem-se com rotação de jogadores, é só olharem para o RV, ele é um génio. Isto é tal e qual como daquela vez que quiseste fazer passar o RV por revolucionário por só chamar um central e de não precisar de levar laterais, ""ah mas o Guardiola também faz"" e depois foi-se a ver e não era verdade.

Enfim... É o RV a bater com a cabeça na parede todos os jogos e tu a dares os parabéns á genialidade dele, não sei quem é pior. Depois não se queixem, não há motivo nenhum para rodar jogadores, como sabemos o aprendiz do RV, o Sr.Guardiola nem gasta muito dinheiro com reforços para o banco, ele joga sem com os mesmo XI e nem faz substituições. Acho que devíamos fazer o mesmo, poupasse em salarios e escusasse até de ter 30 jogadores emprestados.

​e:

e um ""pequeno"" detalhe, talvez queiras enviar o artigo ao teu amigo, não para ele começar a rodar a equipa ou fazê-lo ainda menos. só mesmo porque ele já começou a preparar as desculpas para um possível falhanço:

""Tem sido de uma intensidade enorme. Tenho de dar os parabéns aos jogadores pela entrega ao jogo. Não temos quase tempo de descanso. Gostava de ter menos jogos, mas é isto que temos. Perante este adversário não se notou em termos de intensidade. De uma forma mais fresca e tendo mais descanso, este jogo era nosso"".

&gt;Não temos quase tempo de descanso

Mas afinal há ou não há cansaço? E vindo do treinador que é o unico responsável em rodar a equipa, e que não o faz porque não o quer, vir chorar depois dos jogos que os jogadores fazem muitos jogos em pouco tempo quando tem metade do plantel parado...

E as desculpas do ano passado não pegam, este ano a direção foi buscar alternativas, e foi buscá-las cedo no Verão. Não há alternativas porque o treinador não quer.

This suggests that you're deeply offended by the notion, which indicates that, if nothing else, you're as ideological as the people you despise. My jimmies, however, remain unrustled.

Your first paragraph is a *gross* oversimplification of the political paradigm - *liberalism* can refer to a lot of different things, in a lot of different contexts. Progressives are liberal in the contemporary American sense, and anarcho-capitalists are liberal in the economic sense. However, progressives and anarcho-capitalists are mutually opposed in their viewpoints. This is why your comment about conservatism is overly simplistic, as it doesn't recognize any particular context. It's a low-resolution model, which is a point I've been trying to put forward for the last two days.

You have some real gems in that second paragraph, but I'll be civil and not do line-by-line responses. Instead, I'll point out that this is the most historically ignorant view of European nationalism in the 20th century that I've seen in a while. They were absolutely trying to conserve something - national pride and image. One thing they don't teach you young whippersnappers these days is the relationship between European nationalism and the looming threat of communism in the 1930s, nor do they teach about the Spanish Civil War, or the long-standing consequences of World War One or any of the important history which defines what the world looks like today.

And no, the definition of left-wing isn't ""big government"". The difference between left and right wing politics is a difference of temperament with respect to conscientiousness and openness. You don't understand this, and I understand that the only frame of reference you have is contemporary American politics. *But* - and this is a big *but* - if you invest some time reading about 20th century history, you will find that there's not a single thing I've said that is incorrect.

I'm arguing in the interest of truth, and this seems to be considered *bad faith* to right-wing ideologues.

In any case, defensive warfare is almost always deeply important, and you've gone from a battle that was 4:1 odds to somewhere between 2:1 to 4:3, not exactly overwhelming numbers on the high end for a defensive engagement along with the fact that the Christians had the Knights Hospilire on their side, who were probably the single most professional military force in European History post the fall of Rome, but were rather small.

It spread pretty widely in germania. arian bishop ulfilas christianized the east-germanic speaking goths, who then dissemenated it as they came south establishing their kingdoms in places like spain and italy. 

&gt;Are there any Arians left today?

The original arians died out over time during history, especially after the franks converted to catholicism and conquered most of germanic europe. Visigothic spain was conquered by islam, and then reconquered by catholics. 

So the historical arians? no, they died out. 

However, a few restorationist protestant groups hold beliefs similar to the historical arians in their christology (although that's where the similarties end -- the historical arians still had ""catholic-like"" liturgical praxis; neo-arians are mostly low-church).

She seems to be changing her tune due to the fact that AfD look set to take the next elections but Merkel was queen SJW for ages. Almost single handedly caused the migrant crisis.

&gt;Sorry im not going to watch a 15 minute video to make your argument for you

Why am I not surprised. A quick and informative video by one of the few remaining unbiased newspeople. Facts dont support your ideology so you need to ignore it. I get it man I do.

&gt;More importantly he was Irish by law the day he was born

I did mention that he was. I wouldnt call it important or more important than any of the rest even. It just is what it is.

&gt;DO you see any SJW countries? Because I see plenty of despotic right wing countries

Yeah there are a lot of those in the middle east and asia. The SJW ones would be mainly the Nordic countries and Germany which are slowly starting to fall apart. France was on track for that too but it seems the granny lover president of theirs actually has something resembling a spine. Still somewhat SJWish but not as bad as people expected. May in the UK keeps pandering to them when she can though nowhere near as much as Comrade Corbyn and his communist wing of the Labour party and sadly for them he may get the top spot next time around. In that case Brexit will be used as the excuse for the death of their economy but it will be his socialist policies assuming he implements what he seems to want to.

&gt;Thats not what centrism is, try again

Really. Enlighten me then. What is ""True"" centrism.

&gt;Thats not what liberalism is, try again

Part of Liberalism is protecting the people. You protect the rights of the people which includes protecting their lives and property by restricting who can enter the nation. You clearly dont have a clue about what classical liberal principles are.

&gt;If youre against immigration you are arguing against liberalism and capitalism.

Again Im not against immigration Im against open borders. You can restrict immigration and still allow immigration. Its not an all or nothing thing you know.

&gt; Youre arguing in favor of limiting peoples freedoms

The states first priority is the defense of the nation and its people and that includes immigration policy. People external to the nation state are at best a secondary consideration. The state has no obligation to allow anyone and everyone in as it can harm the people already in the nation.

&gt;youre anti capitalist by limiting capitals ability to use labour. 

Capitalism can work without immigration and has done for a long ass time before it reached the ridiculous levels we have now. Capitalism only likes mass immigration because an influx of unskilled workers drives down wages which is probably great for those coming in who would be making a lot more than they were in their home country but terrible for everyone already here as they lose out on employment opportunities and when they do find work their wages are shit.

&gt;And if youre only against open borders then youre in luck, because only Svalbard has open borders

Funny the EU until recently seemed to have pretty open borders with the millions of people being invited in. And lets not forget the calls for open borders by the SJW types including yourself since youve been arguing for it in this discussion.

Hi guys, just want to jump in to give a quick update. The team still rushing to complete the firmware update in next few days so backers who is receiving the US WH shipments will get to update their units when their superbook arrives.

1) Our Gilroy warehouse logistical provider has confirmed they recieve the containers with the superbook and accessories (including chargers) on Tuesday evening, and is preparing them for shipment. They havn't provided us with the schedule for shipment yet, we are pushing for them to start the shipment to end backer by the weekend/early next week if possible. They usually schedule their shipment team a few day/one week in advance so they can prepare the shipment paperworks and logistical material, we are pushing them to slot us in as soon as possible. Will provide more update when we get the exact date for start of shipment

2) The shipment for the finished APAC units from our manufacturer in china to HK is schedule for tonight (night time in US day time in china). We will provide update for next step once the superbook has cleared customs.

3) EU units still on route, no update there until the ship arrive at Neitherland boarder.

[Eighty per cent of the content](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/24/october-no-longer-deadline-for-brexit-deal-david-lidington-finalising-agreement) of the withdrawal agreement has been agreed. The main remaining sticking point is the so-called “[backstop](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/07/brexit-what-is-the-uks-backstop-proposal)” arrangement for the Northern Irish border. This will be activated in case there is no deal on the EU-UK future relationship by January 1, 2021, when the transition period – during which Britain keeps all access to the European single market in return for taking over all EU rules – comes to an end.

The EU’s proposal for this backstop is to simply isolate Northern Ireland out of the UK and keep it under the EU’s regulatory and common tariff regime. This would avoid checks at the Northern Irish border which some fear would endanger the already fragile peace process. Many EU diplomats genuinely believe this was a fair and balanced offer to the UK, pointing at precedents in countries that have a part of their territory under a different customs regime, including, for example, [Austria](https://twitter.com/pietercleppe/status/1020323471128178689) before it joined the EU.

Many in the EU27 were therefore [concerned](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/28/irish-border-question-must-be-solved-by-uk-not-eu-says-sweden) when, in July, an [amendment](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/16/theresa-may-narrowly-avoids-defeat-after-caving-in-to-rees-mogg) was [adopted](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/brexit-commons-decision-on-customs-safeguards-north-s-place-in-uk-1.3567883) by the British Parliament which rules out a customs border in the Irish Sea.

Given how hard it is for UK MPs to agree on anything Brexit-related, this is quite telling. Some in the EU may think Britain’s stance is irrational and “[ideological](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/28/irish-border-question-must-be-solved-by-uk-not-eu-says-sweden)”, but, given the fact that a large part of the Northern Irish population fears one day ending up a minority in an Irish Republic, it’s a reasonable insistence.

Importantly, however, British MPs have not voted to rule out a regulatory border between Northern Ireland and Britain’s mainland.

Therefore, perhaps a compromise could take the following form: Britain accepting a regulatory border in the Irish Sea and the EU accepting that at some point there will be customs checks on the Northern Irish border. These will be unavoidable if Britain regains the right to set different tariffs than the EU, at least in the absence of customs checks within the UK.

How likely it is to see such a compromise emerge this autumn?

As reported by Bloomberg, the UK government has have been [working](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-02/dup-rejects-customs-border-leaving-scope-for-brexit-solution) on proposals that, according to officials speaking privately, involve keeping Northern Ireland aligned with EU regulations. That would mean putting a regulatory border, but not a customs border, between Northern Ireland and Britain.

Interestingly, Bloomberg claims that Jeffrey Donaldson MP, the Chief Whip of Northern Ireland’s DUP, which props up Theresa May’s government, has “hinted” that the plan could be acceptable. Indeed, he only [mentioned](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-02/dup-rejects-customs-border-leaving-scope-for-brexit-solution) “a customs border” as something that would be “unacceptable” to his party. Perhaps this is all over-interpretation, but both UK and EU officials have pointed out that there are already some differences in regulations between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain and that regulatory checks already exist between the two for animal imports, something that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has been [highlighting](https://www.ft.com/content/9d2409ae-93db-11e8-b67b-b8205561c3fe) as well.

 Barnier has [pledged](https://www.ft.com/content/9d2409ae-93db-11e8-b67b-b8205561c3fe) to “de-dramatise” the EU’s backstop offer by looking at limiting the legal power the EU would wield over Northern Ireland. In particular, this would involve only requiring routine and limited controls and scaling back the powers of the European Court of Justice, which would only be given indirect authority over the UK.

This shouldn’t be that far off what the UK could accept. In its proposals for the future relationship, the UK has suggested an arrangement whereby a joint EU-UK panel would need to refer questions related to EU law to the ECJ and whereby UK courts would need to pay “due regard” to ECJ rulings, even if the UK would be part of a separate jurisdiction.

Even if some kind of “soft” regulatory checks in the Irish Sea were agreed on, the EU would need to concede to customs checks between Northern Ireland and Ireland emerging at some point  — unless it wants to reconsider the UK’s innovative facilitated customs arrangement again.

How likely is a concession on customs checks?

Assuming that different tariffs between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain are a real “red line”, both for the British Parliament and the DUP, demanding to rule out customs checks on the Northern Irish border and thus different tariffs between the UK and the EU is effectively the same as demanding that Britain never recovers an independent trade policy, with the right to set its own tariffs.

Even if Britain did not check that goods crossing the Northern Irish border comply with UK tariffs, surely EU member states would tell Ireland to check if EU tariffs have been paid on goods entering Ireland from the UK.

Irish PM Varadkar may have pledged that not a single one of the 1000 [newly hired](https://www.rte.ie/news/brexit/2018/0718/979422-cabinet-to-discuss-preparations-for-hard-brexit/) customs and supervisory officials will be posted at the Northern Irish border, but other member states may ultimately ask him to put them there.

The UK government has proposed a system that is designed to square the circle, combining different UK tariffs with avoiding Irish customs checks on the Northern Irish border. Its facilitated customs arrangement involves the UK collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU for goods first entering the UK but with the EU as their destination.

Many are rightly sceptical about this system, which involves a high degree of trust, but one could think of arrangements whereby Britain promises to financially compensate for the EU in case of unexpectedly low tariff revenues, if that were the concern. There is a precedent here: in 2009, the EU [agreed](https://twitter.com/HenryNewman/status/1022534028451360768) to trust a non-member’s (Switzerland’s) customs checks as equivalent.

Britain also has the second option of a “[maximum facilitation](https://fullfact.org/europe/post-brexit-customs-max-fac-and-customs-partnership-explained/)” [model](https://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2018/05/henry-newman-no-more-delays-prime-minister-it-is-time-to-make-a-decision-on-customs.html).  “Max fac” attempts to minimise friction at the border using technology and the imperfect precedents of those other two neighbouring countries that are not a member of the EU’s customs union: Switzerland and Norway.

I have been thinking about this increasingly censorized environment for some time. As it so happens, the most successful social media came to life and became successful in the US. The big 5 - FB, Google, Twitter, Reddit and YouTube all originated in the US, where they consolidated into groupings through acquisitions and mergers. Numerous other social media - from matchmaking sites to AirBnB and internet sale sites (eBay, etsy, etc)  are based in the US.  As are important internet tools, including domain holdings (GoDaddy), payment systems (Mastercard, Visa, paypal) and blog platforms (Google, Worldpress, Typepad, etc.). The biggest cloud servers are in American hands (Amazon....?), and of course the movie streaming channels (netflix, Hulu, Amazon prime).

I don't know whether anyone has done it but I am sure the combined traffic on all these sites that originate on American soil is well above 75% of total world traffic, even if we take places like Alibaba, baidu and Yandex into account Plus a smattering of European offerings.

This huge connected internet landscape is now in the process of being weaponized to conform with the Empire's wished. It is not only about suppressing dissent, but also about propagating messages that fit a purely corporate agenda - globally.

Some countries are reacting by drawing boundaries around themselves. Others are fighting back on the ethers. Citizens everywhere continue agitate for their freedom to express their opinions freely but the battle lines are being drawn as we speak.

To me, what happened with The Empire Files and telesur is a preview of what we'll see more of. Even when the servers are out side the Empire's reach as is the platform, there remains the option of sanctioning the forms of payment, like wire transfers and Paypal.

&gt; R.E.M. (an acronym for Rapid Eye Movement) was an American rock band from Athens, Georgia, that was formed in 1980 by drummer Bill Berry, guitarist Peter Buck, bassist/backing vocalist Mike Mills, and lead vocalist Michael Stipe. One of the first alternative rock bands, R.E.M. was noted for Buck's ringing, arpeggiated guitar style, Stipe's distinctive vocal quality and obscure lyrics, Mills' melodic basslines and backing vocals, and Berry's tight, economical style of drumming. R.E.M. released its first single—""Radio Free Europe""—in 1981 on the independent record label Hib-Tone. The single was followed by the Chronic Town EP in 1982, the band's first release on I.R.S. Records. In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, Murmur, and built its reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases, constant touring, and the support of college radio. Following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit in 1987 with the single ""The One I Love"". The group signed to Warner Bros. Records in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide.

&gt; By the early 1990s, when alternative rock began to experience broad mainstream success, R.E.M. was viewed by subsequent acts such as Nirvana and Pavement as a pioneer of the genre. The band then released its two most commercially successful albums, Out of Time (1991) and Automatic for the People (1992), which veered from the band's established sound and catapulted it to international fame. R.E.M.'s 1994 release, Monster, was a return to a more rock-oriented sound, but still continued its run of success. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three of the band members.

&gt; In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US$80 million, at the time the most expensive recording contract in history. Its 1996 release, New Adventures in Hi-Fi, though critically acclaimed, fared worse commercially than its predecessors. The following year, Bill Berry left the band, while Stipe, Buck, and Mills continued the group as a trio. Through some changes in musical style, the band continued its career into the next decade with mixed critical and commercial success, despite having sold more than 85 million albums worldwide and becoming one of the world's best-selling music artists of all time.[7] In 2007, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in their first year of eligibility. R.E.M. disbanded amicably in September 2011, announcing the split on its website.  Read more on Last.fm.

So why did you mention the genetic makeup of Ethiopians when trying to excuse their sophisticated society?


&gt; African civilization was primitive compared to the rest of the world.

By what standards? The Mali Empire was wealthy and prosperous, it's people were sophisticated enough to run quite lucrative trade routes - no small feat. They had a vibrant artistic culture, consider the [Epic of Sundiata,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_of_Sundiata). Their political culture was sophisticated, boasting a fairly in-depth [constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kouroukan_Fouga) with a [deliberative body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gbara) designed to check Imperial power.

While it was a fairly decentralized power, it was capable of raising substantial armies of up to a hundred thousand men and deploying them for prolonged campaigns. That's a remarkable test of a societies ability to manage complex tasks, and any society that could handle the logistics of moving and organizing such a body of men is not 'primitive.' For all their fancy castles, most European powers were not able of maneuvering armies of that size until the 1700s. 


&gt; Even the wealth of knowledge wasn't enough to create an African civilization comparable to 500 BC Greece or Persia. The Songhai empire consisted mainly of farming villages and nomadic people.

Almost every ancient society composed mostly of farming villages and isolated communities, hell every society on earth until the late 18th century really. 


&gt; center*

Center*s*. There were three primary mosques in Timbuktu that constituted the university there, plus numerous private libraries among the Malian upper classes. The patronage of the arts and sciences to such an extent is not a hallmark of a 'primitive' society. 


&gt; It's not about being good at architecture/design. The building tell us how much a society has advanced.

Imagine that, when you would cross a border in the US between states, you would have to stop and wait in a car line for 3 or 4 hours, until some police officers search your vehicle, then you can proceed. You then also have to also exchange your money for other currency, and that always at a loss, and sometimes you even have to pay to exchange your money. You don't know what the money you just got is really worth: Is the street vendor ripping you off, or is it an honest market price? Then, imagine, your car would get stolen. The police don't speak your language, and they don't really care that much that some idiot from, let's say Utah, lost his car in Idaho. Why should they? You're not even a citizen of that state. 

This was the state of affairs for all my parents life. But not in my lifetime, any of those things happened, except when we made vacation in Sweden and hat to exchange Euro for Kronen.

It is an amazing liberty to just cross nation lines as you feel like it; Traveling has never been more comfortable.

Also products! I live in Munich, not far from the Austrian Border. In Austria, they produce a strong and very famous Rum that is sought after by many people outside austria. This Stroh-Rum as it's called wasn't available outside austria, anywhere. So whenever friends or family went for vacation in austria, they would be asked to bring bottles of it with them. But they couldn't bring more than 2 bottles, more would be considered smuggling, and was punishable. Nowadays however, you can buy Stroh Rum in all of the EU, from Berlin to Paris and Rome to Warsaw.

But the EU was not just made to make civilian life easier. As you will surely know, Europe has been a battlefield for ever since men write down history. And those conflicts over territory, or resources or even people have been made possible because leaders were able to make the other nation seem inhumane! To make their own populace be afraid of the others. My grandfather (swiss) told me that his father was shocked when he first saw a french man; because he looked like a man. All he had ever heard of the french, is how cruel and inhuman they are. That they eat babies, and he had expected more of a werewolf than a man. And the EU is meant to make such conflicts like the two world wars impossible; to make people not feel like they are germans, or french, british or polish, but to make them feel european. The hatred between Germany and France was so intense and long lasting that we call it 'Erbfeindschaft', 'Inherited Hatred'. Most of the 50s to the 80s was used to mend that hatred that had existed for well over 4 centuries, and to this day some restaurants in france might not even serve you if you are german. And the EU is an effort to mend all of this; to see neighbouring nations as brothers to support and benefit from, not to rival and compete. And that doesn't mean that rivalry doesn't exist anymore, of course it does. And it also doesn't mean that there isn'r racism, because of course there is. But we want to do everything in our ability to not repeat mistakes of the past. And maybe, if you can understand how I feel, you can understand why I and many others put up with the overbearing bureaucracy, and general legislation that can't fit every country; because for all it's benefits, those things are a fair price to pay for peace.",True,False,False,,0,1535921120,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e5a9c03,False,t3_9bxrhf,True,t1_e5a7a7y,/r/ShitEuropeansSay/comments/9bxrhf/dont_worry_superior_enlightened_europeans_the/e5a9c03/,,1538598181,3,True,False,ShitEuropeansSay,t5_2whth,r/ShitEuropeansSay,public,,

When Japan banned swords and knives for everyone except nobility and Samurai (sound familiar?) the population started adapting everything they could into fighting implements which is why we now have nunchuks, sai, and a whole slew of other former farm implements-turned-weapons. Humans are really good at adapting and innovating around limitations, and Japan's vibrant martial arts scene is proof of that.

The Großes Messer (literally ""Big Knife"") is a German invention sidestepping essentially the first AWB. Swords were banned for everyone except military, but the law included a definition of a sword. As a result, some enterprising smartass took the definition of a knife and made it really big so that people could walk around with it, and when confronted by authorities could point to the law and say, ""No, it's a knife.

So right here, Netanyahu claimed that the Iranians were lying about shutting down their nuclear program and urged Trump to pull the deal. All of the United Nations inspectors and European signatories to the deal said otherwise. 

Now, as you put it: 

&gt; &gt; If a regime, who openly proclaims its intention to destroy you at every moment, gets hold of a weapon that could practically wipe your country off the map in a single hit — I'd call that an existential threat. I don't even know what the phrase 'existential threat' could even mean, if it didn't apply to this scenario. 

This is my point exactly. Netanyahu's rhetoric makes a nuclear threat more likely. There is absolutely no reason to lie about this and push to destroy the deal if your intent is purely to avoid war, especially since non-nuclear conventional armed warfare against Israel is extremely unlikely, both to happen and to succeed. It is unfavorable as long as the United States is supporting Israel, because the US has a bigger swinging dick in the room than the next ten countries combined.

There is, however, reason to lie about it and blow up the deal if you know that a conventional attack is never going to happen, but your seat in power is entirely contingent upon pushing the rhetoric that your nation is under constant threat and needs your strong, steady hand to keep everyone safe, AND you know that your big gormless ally the US can be rather easily persuaded to start a war so you never have to worry about the consequences of pulling the deal in the first place.",True,False,False,,0,1535922573,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e5aarlq,False,t3_9caixk,True,t1_e5a9ydx,/r/Destiny/comments/9caixk/the_iran_deal_destiny_debates/e5aarlq/,,1538598846,1,True,False,Destiny,t5_2qnvz,r/Destiny,public,,

I'd also note I'm not really trying to play ""conservative"", as much as I am the skeptic. 

My point is not that it was ok to conquer the Natives. Often the whole native talking point is presented as this beautiful peaceful homogenous society which was spread all over North America until those damn white people ruined everything. That is the average presentation of the story. None of it is true. The noble savage is a fallacy, the tribes were not peaceful, and the land was not highly occupied. History is not utopia, it's warfare and conquest. If the natives could put their issues aside and band together maybe they wouldn't have been conquered. But they didn't. 

""Refugee resettlement"" is propaganda. The proxy war in Syria is not the cause of the majority of migrants. CIA / MIC overturning Libya, Tunisia, &amp; Iraq all play a part. But additionally most of the ""migrants"" are Sub Saharan Africans who are not fleeing war zones. A fact often ignored. If you propagate the birth rates of Muslims/ Africans in Sweden for example, native born ethnic Swedes become a minority in our life time under certain estimates. To claim this is anything other than a conquest is absolutely absurd. Anyone who believes the European conquest of the americas was bad AND calls a replacement of native Europeans ""refuge resettlement"" is drinking the cool aid and guilty of double think. I'm consistent, conquering America was wrong, but is history. I would be ok with giving the Natives a state for example to peruse their own self determination.

PS I normally don't check out people's past posts.  But this seemed amiss, and not a MAGA or TRUMP supporter, no red-pill, so I checked, yep not a T\_D person.  Seems like Synthell is a commie intellectual philosopher type (and likely **very** young- 2yrs ago asking for pokemon), and has been drinking the commie Kool-Aid, at least he felt the need to try to say how there are different shades of Marxism, Communism, etc.  In Synthell posts this past month:

&gt;*Well dont all capitalists want slave work in a perfect world? Less wages = more profit no? The only people I see negatively affected by immigration generally are the working class and identitarians. Honestly if anything the reason why we have so many immigrants coming into Europe is because of Centre and Right Wing liberals who profit off of this.*

or

&gt;*Yeah the interesting thing is the Communist Parties in most of the East Bloc had a primarily conservative outlook on the social aspect of society. Locked borders, family values, that sort of thing. However their economic values do follow Marx's redistribution of wealth and workers control of production policies he proposed in the Communist Manifesto. But we must also take into consideration that many in the Communist Party were merely opportunists looking for power that cared little for any of the ideological policies of the Communist Party.*

​

So even Synthell sees *\[many in the Communist Party were merely opportunists looking for power\]*, but probably doesn't realize it yet, or wise enough to recognize yet...

Leftists think the gov owns all. It's why **Socialism works perfectly every time** to allow a strongman to be **El Prezidente for Life**.

So soon we shall start simplifying all the LEFTISTS and calling them for what they are

**MARXISM**

Most LEFTISTS, very few are actually the 'enemy', the true enemies are...

The leaders of leftie ideology are the humans that have very bad traits, as there aren't checks on their power.

Leftist Ideology thinks gov is like Excalibur, and try to pull it from the stone to slay every ill or demon they see... from 'war on poverty', hunger, to banning plastic bags and straws.

We think like **George Washington** said, **""Gov is like FIRE. It is a dangerous servant, and a deadly master.""** Our Founding Fathers put Excalibur into the stone for all kinds of great reasons, including the desires of man.

Ich weiß ja nicht was du als Vollversorgung verstehst, aber für mich sind die Leistungen jetzt nicht gerade exorbitant.

Hiermal eine Auflistung:

&gt;Das, was sie für das tägliche Leben brauchen, erhalten sie als Sachleistungen, solange sie in der Erstaufnahme-Einrichtung oder in Gemeinschaftsunterkünften untergebracht sind. Dazu gehören:  
* Sogenannte Grundleistungen (Essen, Unterkunft, Heizung, Kleidung, Gesundheits- und Körperpflege, Haushaltswaren)  
* Geldbetrag für notwendige persönliche Bedürfnisse (""Taschengeld"")  
* Medizinische Leistungen bei Krankheit, Schwangerschaft und Geburt sowie Schutzimpfungen  
* Im Einzelfall auch weitere Leistungen. 

&gt;Wenn Asylbewerber nicht in einer Gemeinschaftsunterkunft wohnen, können die Grundleistungen auch ausgezahlt werden. Zum Beispiel erhalten Alleinstehende dann 216 Euro monatlich für Essen, Unterkunft und andere Grundbedürfnisse.  
Mit dem sogenannten Asylpaket II wurde der Geldbetrag für den persönlichen Bedarf (""Taschengeld"") gekürzt. Alleinstehende erhalten nur noch maximal 135 Euro für ihren persönlichen Bedarf.  

&gt;Bevor Asylbewerber Leistungen bekommen, müssen sie grundsätzlich eigenes Vermögen oder Einkommen aufbrauchen. Dazu zählt auch das Einkommen oder Vermögen der Familienangehörigen, die im selben Haushalt leben.

Yeats in 1919, first printed in The Dial in November 1920, and afterwards included in his 1921 collection of verses Michael Robartes and the Dancer.

We have devolved powers on education and as a result punch way above our weight in terms of universities, world players in many research fields. Oh and we get to go to university for free, which isn’t possible in England. 

There’s many more angles here but long story short the Westminster government are trying to take back some of our devolved powers, recently they resorted to filibusting a Scottish speaker when the subject was Scottish devolved powers for instance and I think that is utterly reprehensible.

Cum ai ajuns la cele doua optiuni? Te atrage vreuna dintre ele, sau le vrei doar pentru ca ti s-a bagat in cap ca elevii destepti se duc acolo? Nu te intreb in nume de rau, aceleasi practici le aveau si profesorii de la liceul meu. Oricum ar fi, tu trebuie sa faci mai multe eforturi spre a te cunoaste pe tine insuti. Doar asa vei putea lua o decizie pe care sa nu o regreti mai tarziu.

Daca te atrag cele doua si nu stii pe care sa o alegi, ia-ti niste timp liber si reflecteaza asupra a ceea ce iti doresti tu in viata. Incearca sa ajuti cateva saptamani la spitalul din localitatea ta. La mine in oras erau multi elevi de la stiinte ale naturii care faceau asta. Uita-te la ce materii se fac la cele doua (medicina generala si automatica, banuiesc) si vezi care te atrage mai mult. Eventual mergi la zilele portilor deschise or smth, participa la cateva cursuri (nu isi va da nimeni seama ca esti outsider, don't worry) sau seminare si vezi ce si cum. Iti place biologia? Chimia? Matematica? Fizica? Iti place programarea? Spune mai multe chestii despre tine. Alegerea facultatii e subiectiva, nu se aplica la cazuri generale. Mai gandeste-te si la timp. Ai timp sa inveti pentru admiterea la medicina? Dar pentru admiterea la UPB? Ai fi dispus sa stai acasa un an, daca nu iti ajunge timpul sa inveti (ceea de e complet ok, depinde cat de confortabil esti tu cu tine insuti si cata importanta acorzi parerilor altora)?

Daca esti chiar complet debusolat si acele doua variante au aparut sub presiuni exterioare, atunci blocheaza acele presiuni si ia-o de la 0. Again, reflecteaza asupra a ceea ce iti doresti in viata. Imagineaza-te in diverse ipostaze. Nu stiu, te poti uita la seriale, poate te identifici cat de cat cu vreo profesie de acolo. Gandeste-te unde ai vrea sa studiezi, in ce oras. Apoi ia universitatile la rand si uita-te la ce programe de licenta au. Separa-le pe alea care ti se par interesante (asta ar fi selectia #1). Dupa aceea, ia-le pe alea la rand si vezi ce materii se fac la fiecare, cum e orarul, cum sunt facilitatile oferite de universitate, cat de mare e taxa, ce asociatii studentesti sunt si ce proiecte au and so on. Pana la urma vei ajunge la o lista relativ micuta si vei ajunge doxa de informatii despre programele alea de licenta. Apoi poti face ceea ce ti-am spus mai sus, cu participarea la cursuri si seminare.

# **Just in case:**

Daca vei lua in considerare **[ASE](http://ase.ro)**, uite doua link-uri useful:

* **[Ce materii se fac la fiecare program de licenta](http://planinvatamant.ase.ro)**;

* **[Ce se invata la fiecare materie](http://fisadisciplina.ase.ro)**;

* Cauta pe Facebook asociatiile studentesti din ASE (ASER, AIESEC, USASE, ESN ASE, ASCIG (pentru facultatea CIG - Contabilitate si Informatica de Gestiune), SiSC (pentru facultatea CSIE - Cibernetica, Statistica si Informatica Economica), VIP, BOS) si vezi cu ce se ocupa fiecare. Iti recomand sa faci voluntariat in facultate;

* Daca te intereseaza **[CSIE](http://csie.ase.ro/)**, cauta pe Google si orarul de la SiSC, ca sa vezi cum e. Daca ai intrebari, imi poti trimite oricand un mesaj.

Daca vei lua in considerare **[FCRP](http://comunicare.ro)** de la **[SNSPA](http://snspa.ro/)** (slabe sanse, avand in vedere cele doua optiuni, but still, just in case), la fel, imi poti trimite un mesaj. 

Mult succes! Si nu criza, eu am ales ~90ish% undeva prin decembrie - ianuarie (clasa a 12-a) si 100% abia dupa bac. Probabil te vei stresa o groaza cu decizia asta, iar peste un an sau doi te vei uita inapoi si te vei amuza. Chiar daca pare asa, NU e nevoie sa iti planifici tot viitorul de acum, de la 18 ani. Alege-ti o directie care  iti place acum si care crezi ca iti va placea in viitorul apropiat. Daca peste 5-10 ani iti vei dori altceva, poti schimba domeniul. O groaza de oameni fac asta.

I didn't make up the claim that low income inequality does not impact growth. Perhaps you thought I did the analysis myself in a spreadsheet or something. Many people have analyzed this, there are lots of papers on it, but I trust Krugman so that is what I'm linking in support of this. If you'd like a study by someone else, google will find you one.

So your argument now essentially boils down to ""Did Nobel Prize Winner Paul Krugman not take into account wealthier countries having lower growth rates in his analysis by naiively comparing the US and other rich nations with high income inequality against poor nations with low income inequality"".

And the answer to that is he did not. They're all western nations, European and North American. Some of the nations with high income inequality have lower GDP per capita like Spain, Greece and Italy (Gee... those happen to be the same countries that had a hard time coming out of the 2009 recession).

Cum? Le interceptezi traficul? 

1\. Explică-mi procedura, chiar sunt curios. 

2\. Nu am zis lack of proof, am zis conflict de interese. Conflictul de interese e un argument bun, chiar atât de bun încât văd necesar ca ei să demonstreze că nu e așa (de exemplu cu un client open). Faptul că clientul nu e open mă face suspicios.

&gt; Sincer, mai bine decat jegul de la telegram, cu un crypto si protocol scris pe genunchi, care e public, dar se schimba randomly.

3\. În ce sens e mai bine? Criptografia și programarea sigură nu se bazează pe obscuritate, ci pe scrutinul comunității; un algoritm cripto bun și un API bun e public, tocmai pentru a permite comunității să-ți corecteze buguri înaintea celor care te atacă si tocmai pentru că știi că vor rezista celor care încearcă să găsească probleme în ele (APIuri, algoritmi de cripto)

Whatsapp a avut antecedente ani întregi de a trimite totul plaintext. MTProto nu e ideal, dar e o variație din AES (știu, don't roll your own crypto) și aproape tot e public. 

Dar pentru WA nu știi absolut nimic, inclusiv dacă exista variații în curbele 25519 ca să fie ""pe genunchi"", nici dacă se schimbă protocolul ""pe genunchi"", iar după achiziție, au făcut cease &amp; desist către oricine încerca să se lege către ei: APIuri custom, modifcări în clienți, boți, etc. Telegram își sprijină comunitatea de developeri, WA îi dă muie. Pentru WA, îmi aduc aminte în ultimii ani de schimbări cu forward, delete, delete pe grupuri și meniul contextual pe mesaje în clientul web. Sigur astea implică schimbări de protocol. Aș zice că alegi să te încrezi implicit în WA, pentru că modificările în protocol sau algoritmii cripto sunt ascunse. Asta nu e poziția ideală: ""Telegram îi schimbă, dar la WA nu știi dacă ii schimba, ergo, telegram e un jeg""

&gt; E super simplu sa [haxoresti un android modern] ...dar nu inteleg de ce e relevant [...] Daca nu ai acces fizic, e mai greu, dar android e cu ani lumina in spatele celor de la apple in privinta asta.

4\. E relevant în contextul postului anterior. De ce crezi că apple de e cu ani lumină înainte? Ce îl face așa?

Eu știu așa: un android mai nou, cu cheile sistemului de fișiere legate de date biometrice, fără prostii instalate off-market, sau eventual doar cu aplicațiile stock, nu prea poate fi accesat remotely (care ar fi o problemă gravă de securitate), exceptând un backdoor nasol, pe care poate îl știe doar NSAul sau chinezii care produc procesoare. Asta se întâmplă cam de la KitKat, parcă, când criptarea FS a devenit obligatorie.

Dacă ai acces fizic, nu poți să-i faci dump la FS fără să-l deblochezi, nu poți să-l deblochezi făra chei, nu poți să accesezi cheile fără parolă/biometrice și nu poți să-i dai factory restore pentru că pierzi cheile (și implicit conținutul de pe FS). Poți afirma că chipurile biometrice ar fi un vector de atac pentru ambele platforme, și aici aș fi de acord. Musai trebuie să-l ai deblocat, ca măcar să îți poți autoriza cheile de debug. 

Serios, explică-mi cum accesezi un android modern (generic, dar accept și să zicem, o versiune anume, sau un mod care afectează câțiva producători), într-un mod _super simplu_, fără acces fizic la el. Sunt interesat de securitate în general, și vreau să învăț.

&gt; Ce? 10 secunde? Poate 15 minute, 

5\. Aici cred că suntem amândoi de acord... 

Asta zic, rootatul nu e proces în care apeși pe un buton si merge (de multe ori). Imaginează-ți că repeți procesul de 10 ori, pe 10 telefoane identice, ca să fii pregătit când te întâlnești cu dumana Firea. Iei toate toolurile și scripturile, le automatizezi, le pui pe un SBC in buzunar, în care îi infigi telefonul, și va rula tot. Ai siguranța că atunci când pleacă, lasă telefonul unlocked, rootul tău îți merge cap-coadă bine, și când posesoarea revine, nu i-ai bușit telefonul?


LE: Poți însă, să îți autorizezi cheia de debug pe un telefon nesupravegheat neparolat, indiferent de platformă, dar asta nu mai e un bug al platformelor... Asta pare de o mie de ori mai plauzibil: faci câteva screenshoturi în WA când posesoarea nu își supraveghează telefonul, dar sincer, e cineva care își lasă telefonul nesupravegheat și neparolat?

There are many projects where the work done is visible to the owner and their construction managers. If you cut a corner due to lack of ability or substitution of material either you will have to redo it on your dime to or pay someone else to do it correctly. Hospital work is notorious for this. Many workers who do not posses the skill sets will attempt the required contract work and will then be laid off if they fail. It is not a question of honesty or integrity. 

“There you go. In that example, there is a legal, trained specialist who is cutting corners and putting a legitimate face on substandard work. If this can happen this way, it can happen in other ways too, and it undermines the whole idea that workers with legal papers are necessarily going to be honest and be responsible for good work.”

Your right it can happen with legal workers, but it usually does not because trainings and apprenticeships follow strict guidelines set forth by the agencies like the IBEW, NFPA and other local authorities having jurisdiction that know the standards. You’ll always have workers trying to cut work for the same or more pay, but there is a lot of integrity in the industry because the lay off rate is so high and people routinely die when things are not done correctly. 

“The US and European countries are the only places with skill certifications, and safety and building requirements?”

Yes for most part the EU actually surpasses the US’s standards and is one of the reasons why construction is so slowed down over there. Project managers and skilled tradesman are flocking to the US because of this.

I have no idea how easy or hard it would be to get a job in your field with your qualifications but the UK is full of castles that would probably value that. 

What I can say, from my own personal experience as an EU immigrant myself, is that even if you start off with a minimum wage paying job, as long as it's something you like or are passionate about, you can always progress within most companies and conquer a better lifestyle with time, and you can always keep applying for something in your field even as you find initial work elsewhere.

I suspect a retailer like Game could be a good fit as a starting point for example if you wanted something temporary and fun while you search for something in your field.

If you work 40h+ per week you CAN afford a place buy yourself with council tax, energy, broadband bills, and still have money to spare. This will all depend on where you live and the type of flat you take on.
Flat sharing initially is probably going to be a good idea if you were to move to the UK alone, as you'll be able to save a lot more money, just need to be a bit lucky with the kind of flatmate you get.

But yeah in short you can definitely get a better lifestyle here. The better lifestyle is something you conquer over time, and it can take a bit of time depending on where you end up landing and whether you live alone, the job you get, etc.

I'm from Portugal myself and the weather didn't phase me too much. I too am an indoors creature and I got used to it rather quickly. I came to the UK to be with my girlfriend who already lived here and that was a big incentive for me. Not only I was getting to live with the love of my life but I was going to be independent for the first time in my life. We go back and visit the families to our home countries at least once a year (I go usually once, she usually goes back home at least twice) so do take that into account expenses wise. 

After a year we bought a car which made commuting and shopping much easier and we've both progressed in our careers and have recently bought a second car and a house. Our lives are here now and we're as happy as we could be.

With a bit of luck and the right mindset you can make it anywhere. Scotland is particularly inclusive and open to immigrants and you don't pay for healthcare.

If you're serious about it, I have no doubt you'd make it here. Your English seems fine to me.
But immigration can be a bit intimidating, especially if alone, so if you consider it more seriously, you need to ask yourself if you could live with seeing your family once or twice a year, missing birthdays and even births in the family (any future nephews or nieces?), not being there when your folks get older and need more support, the colder and cloudier weather vs almost always sunny back home, things like that.

I hope this helped but feel free to ask if you have any more questions.

Long Beach, for being a so cal city, is pretty progressive in its planning and planning initiatives. If you read the literature on parking, from both engineers and planners, you aren't going to like what you read, parking is a massive misuse of public land. It doesn't support businesses as much as it's often billed to do. Never mind the public health, infrastructure and environmental issues associated with vehicle infrastructure. Nor does it contribute to urban fabric and livability, especially downtowns. Those surface lots could be parks or mixed use buildings with more jobs and units. 

When was the last time you saw free on street parking or a surface lot in a downtown or CBD of a European city or NYC/Chicago/DC? East long beach has plenty of parking from what I understand, but so cal citizens have too many cars and junk in their garages anyway.

That said, the city has the prerogative to grant development standard relief if they see fit. If the current, which is over parked at 1.2 per unit, requests the relief and its granted you should be mad it wasn't through the *state* density bonus law which would have provided income restricted units. Downtown is one of the few areas south of the Bay Area served by light rail in its downtown area. Parking in excess is not appropriate here. Density is. 

Developers are for their part greedy, and the cost of parking their units drives up their costs supposedly. But in our current paradigm that's reality. This isn't the place to discuss that, but if you take them at their word, the best way to incentivize them to increase density is to remove parking. 

This also reaches into another discussion around transit and access to it. Fact of the matter is, on street parking and other VMT inducing uses (parking structures) do not contribute to transit working properly. 

Ultimately, if you don't like it I suggest you consider moving. I'm not saying that to be petulant, partly, but honest. If you look at DTLA2040, a zero parking minimum may be a reality, if you look at their developments city wide they are often at code minimum and utilize TOC or density bonuses to reduce parking. The state and planning as a profession is moving this way for downtowns, you're unlikely to see relief. We can argue all day about if that's right or wrong, or how you should have your private vehicle subsidized with on street parking, but end of the day parking requirements in new development stand to be reduced. If you want the benefits of an urban downtown it comes with trade offs.

I also read English speaking newspapers and I think most journalists get it wrong because they're looking for clicks. So they only report on issues when they happen and say that things have always been that way in Spain.

I've also wanted to understand the origins of the movements that we see today. I've always been interested in where Basque and Catalan separatism came from and why it never took off in other regions like the other Catalan speaking regions, Galicia where it would seem obvious since language is a big component of the former two. But also other places in Spain too such as Navarra, Andalusia, Aragon, and Asturias which also could have historical and linguistical reasons for wanting to claim their different. Until I read this thread, I didn't really know much about Basque nationalism so thanks Metro for sharing the info you did. 

But yeah......I've been talking to some friends and people that I meet on the streets about the issue. A lot of them, as Lupine said, a lot of people only read into the issue up until a certain point or they don't really seem to care and will say ""oh it's really complicated, they've always wanted that"" when I try to get more into the roots. 

Super hardcore separatists will also say that to make it seem like it's been an eternal conflict about nationalist. 

But, from what I've read, seen, and heard, it doesn't seem that complicated and I think it's inaccurate to say that it's always been that way in Spain.

Certainly, Spain has a messy history and the 19th century was a mess as the country tried to figure out how to reorganize itself.  I wouldn't even characterize the Carlist Wars as a nationalistic struggle the way some people do. It really seems as if Basque nationalism starts at the end of the 19th century. However, I don't think know much about it during the first half of the 20th century except that Basque industrialist usually were on the side of Madrid and also that the Nationalist following the war were very repressive in the Basque region especially.  Some of Franco's most embarrassing international incidences occurred from events happening there. 

If I'm reading the history correctly, it seems as if other movements inside the Basque region were willing to join up with the Nationalist, but decided against it when they told them that they weren't going to have their fueros. 

After the 60s, it really seems to take on its modern form as ETA evolves from being a joint Basque and working-class movement to simply being a militant Basque separatist movement. During the 80s,90s, and 2000s PNV was pretty instrumental in helping to end their activities while also securing a tax agreement, their fueros, with the government.  

When it comes to Catalan nationalism, it really appears as if people confuse ""Catalanism"" with ""Catalan nationalism"". It seems Catalan industrialist in the 19th century have always been promoters of Catalan culture and language. Their vision was to make Barcelona, the Paris of Spain. Like the Basque industrialist, they too took the side of Madrid, since working class people in Catalonia were anarchist, and I believe this region of Spain contained the largest amount in Europe and were responsible for some terrorist attacks. So the industrialist feared anarchist overturning the capitalist order in Catalonia. 

With the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, there's a shift as he bans Catalalism when the industrialist hoped he would promote their interest. It's during this time period that Catalanism turns into  Catalan nationalism. The ERC  is founded during this period which promoted the idea of an independent Catalonia. In this era, that Catalonia was inside a federal Spain. It's something that a lot of anarchist and industrialist got behind although many of the latter did support the Nationalist.

In their efforts to address regional suppression during the Franco era, the writers during the transition declare certain parts of Spain as ""historic nationalities"". I think this is the powder keg which the current crisis spawns from. Something that was once a regional region inside Spain is institutionalized in the constitution and is used as a flashpoint. With that comes regional media and education which also promote the idea. I think this is the beginning of the current era of Catalan nationalism.

(Also in my mind, the problem about Spains reorganization issue which started in the 19th century was only halfway answered during this period. I don't think anyone can be faulted for not wanting to try something new after everything that had happened. Had Spain been more industrialized and more socially mobile for the poor and working classes then various factions wouldn't have spawned in the 19th and 20th century . Spain could have successfully reorganized itself without the government collapsing during either Republic era or following the first constitutional monarchy and these issues probably wouldn't exist.)

Fast forward to the mid to late 2000s and Catalan nationalism is a fringe issue. The mainstream parties promote and pass a package they later send to Madrid regarding finances and being a nationality. The latter idea coming from the constitution which is then put at conflict with the idea of the country being indivisible.  The supreme court, under PP votes it down, the keg goes off, and separatist parties come to power. It doesn't help that the crisis started during this time period in which Madrid has to enact austerity measures which are further used for political purposes.  

Did I hit the major points or am I missing something?

It's always interesting to me that none of this ever happened in Galicia, Valencia, or the Balearic Islands. Does anyone know why it's been that way?

This time it is about a feature that does not correspond to anything we’ve had in the original Rome, which is our new Military Traditions system.

There are seven different military traditions in the world, tied to which culture-group you have, and due to the size of the traditions and how they are structured you will see rather different and unique nations.

Military Traditions unlocks unique abilities, unlocks new units and give special bonuses to units.

Each Military Tradition has one bonus they get from the start, and then three different paths they can go down through, where after you have picked the seventh tradition in that path, you’ll get the a special benefit for that as well. 

It is not very likely you will get to the end of all paths by the end of the game, so you really have to think about which path you want to progress down through first. One military tradition currently costs 800 military power, and each tradition taken increases the cost by 50%, and each military technology level reduces it by 25%.

Today we’ll take a look at the Barbarian military tradition, which is used most cultures in north-western Europe.

They all start with the bonus to unlock Chariots as a unit. Chariots are relatively cheap, and faster than infantry, and utterly destroys light infantry on the battlefield.

The first path of the Barbarian Traditions is the Britannic Path.

* Scythed Chariots: +15%Chariots Offensive
* Coming of Age +15% Light Infantry Defensive
* Living off the Land -15% Land Unit Attrition
* Word of Mouth +25% Manpower Recovery
* Chariot Mastery +15% Chariots Morale
* Selective Breeding -25% Light Cavalry Cost
* Take up Arms +15% Archers Morale

End bonus for this path is ‘Trained Cavalry’ which gives +15% Discipline to both Light Cavalry and Chariots.

The second path of the Barbarian Traditions is the Germanic Path.

* Strike and Withdraw +15% Light Infantry Morale
* Natural Resources -25% Light Cavalry &amp; Chariots Cost
* Ambush +25% Combat Bonus for Light Infantry in Forest
* The Glory of the Hunt Allows ‘Raiding’
* Shield Wall +15% Heavy Infantry Defensive
* The Young Must Serve -25% Light Infantry Cost
* Hail of Stones +15% Archers Defensive

End bonus for this path is ‘Adaptability’, which gives +15% Discipline to Light Infantry.

The third path of the Barbarian Traditions is the Gallic Path.

* Strike From Afar +15% Archers Offensive
* Confederations +15% Global Manpower
* The Plains Fight With us +15% Combat Bonus for Light Infantry &amp; Chariots on Plains
* In Defense of our Home Allows ‘Levies’
* A People on the Move 25% quicker Unit Recruitment
* Strong Arm +15% Heavy Infantry Offensive
* Scale the Walls! +15% Siege Ability

End bonus for this path is ‘Blow the Trumpet, in the New Moon!’, which gives +10% Land Morale.

Not all cultures were conducive to intellectual flourishing and human progress. Most ancient cultures were warlike and preoccupied with survival and conquest and didn't have the drive or motivation to delve in deep philosophical inquiries. Some were extremely hostile and resistant to adopting new ideas, while others were complacent and only followed what was forced upon them.

Modern science didn't exist in a vacuum. And neither  was the scientific revolution an inevitability which would have come about anywhere else. If that were the case the Muslims, the ancient Chinese and Indian civilizations, both of which were at one time far more advanced than the West would have produced the scientific revolution but they did not.

Modern science is predicated on the idea that nature is ordered and intelligible, and that certain laws that dictate how nature behaves, and these laws came from a lawgiver. The first true scientists such as Copernicus, Galileo , Newton, Faraday had the courage to formulate science because they believed the universe had been created by a reasonable God and as such it was possible to ascertain what was true about the Universe by reason.

&gt;A world without Christianity would mean a world with less science. I know this sounds outrageous to the less informed atheist or to the New Atheist, but ""it is no coincidence that science sprang, not from Ionian metaphysics, not from the Brahmin-Buddhist-Taoist East, not from the Egyptian-Mayan astrological South, but from the heart of the Christian West,""

The Origin of Science
http://www.columbia.edu/cu/augustine/a/science_origin.html

&gt;Various agnostics and theists have criticised atheism for being an unscientific, or overly dogmatic and definitive position to hold, some with the argument that 'absence of evidence cannot be equated with evidence for absence'. The philosopher Alvin Plantinga argues that a failure of theistic arguments might conceivably be good grounds for agnosticism, but not for atheism, and points to the observation of an apparently ""fine-tuned Universe"" as more likely to be explained by theism than atheism. Oxford Professor of Mathematics John Lennox holds that **atheism is an inferior world view to that of theism**, and attributes to C.S. Lewis the best formulation of Merton's Thesis that **science sits more comfortably with theistic notions, on the basis that Men became scientific in Western Europe in the 16th and 17th century ""Because they expected law in nature, and they expected law in nature because they believed in a lawgiver.' In other words, it was belief in God that was the motor that drove modern science.""** The leading American geneticist Francis Collins also cites Lewis as persuasive in convincing him that theism is the more rational world view than atheism.

To simplify, there are two ways for an internet signal to reach your device at 35,000 feet. The first is via ground-based mobile broadband towers, which send signals up to an aircraft’s antennas (usually on the base of the fuselage).


As you travel into different sections of airspace, the plane automatically connects to signals from the nearest tower, so there is (in theory at least) no interruption to your browsing. But if you’re passing over large bodies of water or particularly remote terrain, connectivity can be an issue.
The second method uses satellite technology. Planes connect to satellites in geostationary orbit (35,786km above the planet), which send and receive signals to earth via receivers and transmitters. These are the same satellites that are used in television signals, weather forecasting, and covert military operations.
Information is transmitted to and from your smartphone via an antenna on the top of the aircraft, which connects to the closest satellite signal. Information is passed between the ground and the plane via the satellite. Wi-Fi signal is distributed to plane passengers via an on board router.


In  both cases, the US has a much more developed infrastructure than anywhere else in the world – so US carriers have a better (and cheaper) Wi-Fi offering than those in Europe.

The whole water cycle is disrupted or eliminated from inland areas as land based water sources evaporate. Crops have no water for irrigation anywhere but the coast, and only in the presence of desalination sources. Dust bowls begin everywhere there isn't an ocean as plant life in general is unable to survive. 

Winter as we know it is gone, ""summer"" lasts 10-11 months out of the year and temperatures of 45-50c become relatively common. It might rain a few times in December. Storms, hurricanes, and other weather events that used to occur every hundred years are now annual events or more frequent.

The poles are fully melted. Sea levels rise by 10-20m. **Roughly 10% of humanity lives within 10m of sea level**, with east-Asia being the worst affected. Current islands become submerged.

Impoverished, truly desperate people will invade still-habitable lands like swarms of locusts, draining what little resources remain. Wars will break out over natural resources between countries that still have some sovereignty and power. Supply chains will break down. The global economy is long-destroyed.

Even worse, the rise in sea temperatures will completely eliminate fishing stocks and start to kill off the ocean flora that generates the majority (~70%) of the world's oxygen. 

And you think air conditioning will save you...

Above those temperatures, earth will pretty much become uninhabitable as chemical changes in the atmosphere and ocean turn toxic to current life.

&gt; Olga de Souza artistically known as Corona was born in Rio de Janeiro in a musical family, her father being a musician and her mother a singer, music has been her passion ever since she was young. 
Olga worked in a bank (Caixa Economica Federal) for a couple of years before deciding to travel around the world, from The States to all over Europe, finally arriving in Italy, where she was discovered....
The year 1994 she debut with ‘The Rhythm of the night’ which stated number one in the top ten Italian charts for 13 consecutive weeks and was distributed to the European market by Warner Music and produced by DWA.
In England within weeks ‘The Rhythm of the night’ topped the charts and was the best selling album, more than 1,000,000 copies sold. The song became the catchphrase for that summer and Corona the most sought after artist.
She attained 15 gold and platinum discs.
She began the first grand world tour and ‘The Rhythm of the night’ was released in the United States and immediately became a hit and maintained the number one position in the classifieds.
Within months Corona became the undisputed queen of dance music globally.
The consecutive single release were equally successful, Baby Baby, Try me out, I don’t wanna be a star (1995)
In 1996 Corona for the first time debuts as a presenter cum singer in a T.V. program (festival Bar) in Italy, which turned out to be a great success that she was invited the year after to present ‘Dance Machine’ in France and she also conquered the French public.
In 1998 the album ‘Walking on music’ was released.
With great passion for music and the continuous search for new sounds, rhythms, styles and new genre, the album AND ME U was released in the 2000.
In 2004 a tribute to her native Brazil, Corona sang ‘A cor dos teus olhos’ (The colour of yous eyes) which was distributed by ‘5000’ Corona defines the song like an imprint of her childhood memory. The song became an immediate hit. The same year ‘Garota Brasileira’, a song with spicy samba sounds became a hit with the Japanese public.
In 2005 she collaborated with Shake Record with the accomplishment of another three hits, ‘Break in time’ ‘I’ll be your lady’ and ‘La playa del sol’.
In 2006 she participated as a guest star in a project called ‘Angel live concert’ dedicated to Karol Wojtyla.
In 2007 she returns to The States, where she sang ‘Baby i don’t care’ and continued her tour.
In 2010/2011 an album dedicated to the new generation called ‘Y’ Generation, 10 brand new songs ranging from Rock,Pop to Dance was released by an independent label 1° POP. ‘Welcome’ , ‘Angel’ , ‘I cant’t wait’, ‘Gimme love’,’Fly away’,’My song’,’Black Cinderella’,’Saturday’,’Beat and shake’,’Beating’.

The vanilla white Christian nuclear family straight way of life was created to control people, so those who choose to belong to it keep breeding and enforcing authority and created new generations of obedient workers for the ruling class.

Community is , or started out being, place based - who are you actually around - not organized around disparate cultural groups based on arbitrary categorization dictated by the mainstream culture forced down everyone's throats.

Every culture has its own way of determining identity. I would never say a European has a specific identity due to their whakapapa, or I would never say somebody who is descended from a Scottish person has turangawaewae in Glasgow, simply because that is not how European people codify identity. European cultures codify identity in totally different ways, so would use European concepts of identity to codify European identity.

Hence why I called those identities national identities, because they are identities associated with nations within the European methods of codifying identity.

By allowing ethnic groups to define their identity in terms that originate within that ethnic group you give the ethnic group control of their identity.

We had a few messages back and forth and eventually he suggests brunch. I was busy that weekend, so suggested the weekend after. 

Come around the weekend, we've met up at a cafe I chose. We really hit it off, I hadn't laughed so much around a guy in a long time. In terms of interests we only had a few in a common but we definitely had the same sense of humour. The chemistry was strong! We left the cafe an hour and a half later and he asked I wanted to go for a walk. We start walking around the neighbourhood but there aren't any good parks. I suggest a park but it's a 20 minute drive so we decide to take his car and he'd drop me off later.

We start blasting old Blink-182 songs on the drive there and just general goofing. We get to the park, I'm not dressed for hiking at this point (I rocked up to brunch in a skirt and boots). Nonetheless we start hiking and going off the beaten path. Eventually, we stop next to a river and sit on a pile of leaves. It's now about 3 hours from the start of the date. We continue goofing and laughing, gradually moving closer and finally making out. We pause, laugh about how long that build up was and continue making out. Let's just say things got steamy after that, I had a great time haha. 

I would have stayed there all day with him if I could but it was my mates birthday and we had plans. He drops me back off to my car and we say our goodbyes.

Neither of us mentioned a second date at the time but I did end up messaging the next day and telling him I was interested in seeing him again. There's no second date but regardless it was an amazing day.

No we aren't. Some are far more horrible than others. We sure 'could be' or even 'have been somewhere in some time' but no we aren't all equally as horrible and you can become very aware of this with two versions of the same hypothetical questioning:

- You can choose any time or place in history, jump in a time machine and you have to live the rest of your life in it once you arrive. 

Nearly THE main first priority in your mind is finding the least horrible, shortlisting way kinder, gentler, just societies and scratching off way way wayyy more horrible places as absolute no-go zones! 

Worth noting:  Wealth would not actually be a big priority because you probably wouldn't want to live in the Mongol Empire even when it was actually booming with cash and wealth but you might want to live in England in 1200 even if they may not have been too wealthy, they were already getting heavily into justice, charity, human rights. You wouldn't even consider living in most of the America's prior to Europeans and if you did you'd choose ones that, for example, didn't have massive human sacrifices, were savages or were being forever attacked by them. 

and the other version is to imagine you've somehow been exiled from your home country. You are sitting in an international airport without any country. (this actually happens) but for you there is great news - a UN rep arrives and says the world agreed you can choose the passport of *any* country on earth on the one condition that you have to live and work there your entire lifetime and that of any family you have. Sorry, you can never leave its borders. Okay so you choose...?

You will almost certainly choose The USA or at least one of the other siblings like Canada, Australia or mother UK and maybe possibly a Western European country. And you would have a dozen NO CHANCE No-Go! Countries you would not even want to think about because you'd be terrified to step off the plane and never mind live there. There would be wide value variations in your mind ranging from 'a living hell' to wild happy excitement at a new life, a dream, of 'heaven on earth' or at least a safe comfy good life forever.

But doesn't break this down into male vs female.

Looking at it simplistically, if men are 4 times more likely than women to kill themselves generally, but female doctors are 4 times more likely to kill themselves than male doctors, does that then equalise the rates vs genpop?

Which is why i told you to read the GFA agreement, which you didn't given how quickly you replyed and that you immediately focused on the border.

The reasons why i said that is because the GFA says nothing about the border and doesn't prohibit customs checks in anyway. Which is obvious to anyone who remembers Ireland talked about reintroducing light checks on the border back in 2008. 

The desire to avoid a border is the preference of both the UK and Ireland not a legal requirement for ether. 

Next i would point out the UK has already proposed an alternative which the EU rejected even though there own report concluded it was workable and would permit maximum flexibility for both sides. 

However separating NI from the UK and putting under-control of a foreign goverment which is what the EUs proposal would involve without the express consent of people of NI does very explicit break the GFA which makes extensive provisions regarding how NI is to be governed and its status as part of the UK.

I built a career in technology and after the first year in US I was pull in by the investors who were starting a new company and asked me to be their lead architect. I after that I worked on a string of startups each in a completely different tech area and moved to silicon valley. During this time, I had an insatiable urge to travel. I did car trips with friends to grand canyon,  DC to Maine, Canada, LA to SFO to Las Vegas, then visited Europe. I was learning to fly, I used to ice skate, swim, I used to do regular hiking in national parks, did a bit of rock climbing, started learning sailing. Strange thing is I did all this in a span of 2 years. In was the beginning of my big adventure of a life. I had the income, I had the energy, I had the friends and I had the mindset. Then i met my wife.

I gave up my career and moved across the ocean to be with her. In the past 18 years (before coming our of FOG) we have visited like only 3 places. And each time it was a drama.  Thats the main reason we dont travel. Even if there is a dot on the floor of the hotel, the entire trip is destroyed. If we have one meal she doesnt like, then she is sick the entire trip. If there is one insect, then we have to remove all our luggage clean and repack. Only way to suit her demands is to book only the top 5 star hotels. Its just so draining. And then we cant really visit tourist places, only shops. Over time I just lost interest and gave up on travelling. Recently after coming out of FOG I have started making travel plans. Mainly for the benefit of our son - things that would give him awesome experiences. 

I have given up all my hobbies and all my friends. Alienated my family. Our everyday life is just the 3 of us, go to drop off at school. Do groceries. Go out to shops. Come home. No one else to talk to, no one visiting, no one to visit, nothing. When I got out of FOG first thing I realised was - where the heck was that guy that I was 18 years ago?. Really made me sad.

So your dad's story rings so true to me. The thing is, you are drained every single day just getting through the day's dramas, guilt trips, accusations, escalations, what not. And anything you want to do will cause a new drama. Who wants that? So we just suppress every part of our life that does not get approved by our pwBPD and just trudge along.

&gt; Can she be so soul-sucking?

Absolutely. Even today, my wife turned from happy to angry in one split second and suddenly I felt like my life drained out of me. Even on the best days, she just puts a damper on everything.

You can also argue that people who voted leave, voted because what they want for the UK is not possible in the EU.  That doesn't mean that they all wanted the same thing (again, in much the same way that people who voted remain did so on the basis of a whole slew of different issues).

&gt;Many of them voted thinking we would still have all the benefits of the EU plus 360 mil per week for the NHS.

Really? I don't think I've ever met a leave voter who thought the UK would have 'all the benefits' of EU membership on leaving. 

I get the impression that's more of a claim being made by remain to try to de-legitimise why people might have voted leave.

&gt; Given that they are never getting what they voted for

The UK is leaving the EU, so those voters are absolutely getting what they voted for. After all, they voted to leave the EU.

&gt;in fact, other than the hard brexit nutcases nobody will, a rerun seems entirely democratic as does splitting the leave vote or at least having a 'leave no deal pile of shite' vs 'remain and not get totally fucked'.

Can we split the remain vote too then? Remain in the EU but with no further integration, Remain in an EU with an immigration cap, Remain in the EU as it is now, remain in the EU but without EU integration on defence, remain in the EU and join Schengen and so on and so forth? 

No, because that'd be daft. It's a binary question, whether we are in the EU or not. Once we have made that decision (and we have) there are then other decisions that need to be made moving forward.

That said, if there is enough support for an additional vote, then sure, lets have one, and let the EC put together a reasonable and fair question, and then have the government act on it. But at the moment that support simply isn't there either.

A temporary impact that continues to happen forever because you keep the supply shock happening forever is not temporary. There is no recovery if the level of immigration is sustained. Not to mention that once again ""temporary"" and ""small impact"" are again status signalling words, these people don't have the savings to weather through this artificial crisis you've created, and this ""small impact"" is massive for them.

From your own article

&gt;The impacts of immigration on the labour market critically depend on the skills of migrants, the skills of existing workers

Which is why low skilled immigration like the migrant crisis is bad for low skilled workers. High Skilled immigration where the UK steals all of the doctors India desperately needs is technically bad for Doctor's wages, but we tend to care less about them since they are already making that sweet sweet NHS dough and it is really hard to argue to spend more on the NHS for the same care just to protect doctor wages.

&gt;more significant effects along the wage distribution: low-wage workers lose while medium and high-paid workers gain

You do realize that the left is suppose to care for the low-wage workers, not the medium and high paid ones? I feel like what ended up happening is that the parties just started catering to champagne socialists directly rather than attracting them simply with signalling points

&gt;The wage effects of immigration are likely to be greatest for resident workers who are migrants themselves.

Was anything I said not true? Even I'm surprised on how well your own article meant to ""refute"" me has aligned with stuff I said in my post. When I said that ""the left cares more about brining more minorities to signal how much they care about minorities rather than increase the well being of the minorities they already have"" I was saying it from a theoretical perspective where it stood to reason that poor migrants would be negatively impacted by further migration, I never expected your source to actually confirm this.

Additionally I found an important thing I didn't even consider

&gt;the evidence suggests that immigration from outside the EU could have a negative impact on the employment of UK-born workers, especially during an economic downturn

It should be noted that intra-EU immigration is structually different than extra-EU immigration. Should wage conditions in the UK change, Poland migrants are likely to return to Poland since the economic calculus has changed, but outside EU migration the wage difference is much larger, thus even if wages fall, it is still better than what they could get back home. The EU acting as a single labour market, in many ways is a single labour market and thus responds better to market forces which mitigates the effects it might have, while outside EU labour does not respond in the same way.

&gt;any declines in the wages and employment of UK-born workers in the short run can be offset by rising wages and employment in the long run.

The ""positive"" effects of out EU migration would more or less be obtained by for instance adding the former Yugoslavia to the EU, since it revolves around increased investment and demand for goods. Similarly simply taking actions to increase exports and foreign investment can do it much better than trying to bring customers to you. A lot of people seem to not like all the Russians buying up London real estate driving up prices, this is what investment means, its true that the ""economy"" will do better if the immigrants drive up the amount of investment going on in london real estate causing construction jobs for instance, but you really need to ask yourself if this investment is worth the increased housing costs.

&gt; ""the left"" this boogieman you keep referring to supports higher minimum wage 

Its amazing how you will adopt the libertarian argument for immigration, but won't adopt the libertarian argument for why the minimum wage hurts the people it claims to help. The minimum wage leads to unemployment, instead of hiring 10 workers, the company will hire 8, and now 2 people are unemployed. Those 8 people now have a higher wage, but those 2 people now have the real minimum wage, which is 0. 

Technically immigration restrictions have the same economic effect as increasing the minimum wage, however the portion of the labour market that gets locked out are the people from outside the country who are never let to enter rather than people within the country. 

&gt; universal healthcare etc. which is benefiting the poor already in the country. 

And since these things already exist, the poor can vote for the people addressing a current issue rather than voting for the left simply because they were the ones who created this program in the past. In Canada, our conservative party does not touch this (even though they really should because our single-payer system is worse than literally every single one that exists in Europe (which tend to be multi-payer) and its only by comparing to the US that it can even look decent) instead what they argue for is MORE merit based economic immigration to decrease the costs of healthcare by bringing doctos, where as our Liberal party seems to be obsessed with bringing low skilled immigrants in the form of extended family and refugees, which would simply add more stress on the system.

&gt; China has culled more than 38,000 pigs in a bid to contain an outbreak of African swine fever that has also reared its head in Europe and is threatening international pork supplies.

&gt; Officials have recorded six outbreaks in China across five provinces over the past month, as Anhui province declared 134 hogs had died from African swine fever most recently.

&gt; Anhui province, Henan province, Jiangsu province and Zhejiang provinces have also been affected and joined the government-ordered cull to contain the spread. Although not harmful to humans, the disease is deadly to both domesticated pigs and wild boar, causing hemorrhagic fever in the animals, which frequently ends in their death over a matter of days.

* Is Erdogan and power circles in Turkey pushing for an anti Western line? Yes
* Has there been a cultural change in the last 15 years? Yes.
* Are indicators of public serenity getting worse? Yes.

etc. However the rise of an anti-western spree isn't entirely and singularly caused by the ideologies or opinions of Turkey's leaders as she and many writers claim.

I mean she cites the TRT ending their western movies hour as a sign of the times yet doesn't mention the recent spat with the US.

We have seen that the AKP and Erdogan himself was perfectly happy with working with the West be it in economic or geopolitical reasons, even now the government is trying to rekindle the relationship with the EU to have a counter balance against the US policies.

I believe while the faults of the government and the country should never be ignored, but writers keep ignoring issues and reasons such as:

* EU backtracking on membership and other relationship goals constantly
* EU support for terrorist groups inside Turkey, the constant barrage of PKK rally images in Europe for the past 20+ years.
* The main focal point YPG area the French and US SOF operators there, 25+ bases, US threatening to attack Turkish troops there.
* The constant marketing of any anti-terror operation Turkey conducts abroad or inside the country being shown as genocide etc. while Turkey suffers constantly because of ""anti-terror"" operations the west undertook in Iraq and Syria. Merkel who is usually more level headed when it comes to Turkey compared to other European leaders talked about ""Massacres in Afrin due to aerial bombardments"" the city was taken without a fight as YPG abandoned it. It is just a constant black propaganda and people take notice. 

Hell US is pushing for countries to stop all trade with Iran and signals that it will hit Iran very soon; it will wreck Turkey by sending millions more refugees and making one of the rare stable countries of the region into a terror/violence and crime hotspot. US is demanding we end our oil imports from Iran (a huge cost) and sanctioning us at the same time ""WTF more do you want?"" would be apt.

The Syria YPG-PKK situation tacit support (200 more trucks load of weaponry were sent again last week to them) would have been enough for any country to completely end whatever alliance they have with any country that participated in that effort as Turkish troops keep getting killed by AT-4 guided anti tank missiles fired by terrorists that live in caves. The fact that there are still US bases and soldiers inside Turkey and that Turkey has to cater to the whims of the US and by extension the West is an anomaly from how a country would act in her shoes but Turkey due to geography and economics; relies on the US and the West and can not act too independently...signs show us this is changing but will take time. US is pushing many countries and blocks such as the EU to seek new partners and look after themselves; blaming the current state of affairs only on internal actors in Turkey speaks to the US and Western exceptionalism more than providing any sensible advice to future leaders.

The current state of affairs would not be solved just by changing rhetoric or having a friendlier sugar dressing on the relations; as long as the US and the west by extension keep pushing for policies that directly impact Turkey and countries like her without taking their needs into consideration relations will suffer.

You can not arm train and equip the biggest primary threat of a country all the while ridiculing it for not solving a 40+ year issue with arrogance and then blame the entirety of the anti-western sentiment on one man and his cohort. Afrin, ES operations were supported by all sides of the political spectrum in Turkey anti or pro Erdogan; this fact is always ignored by the west and writers such as this because it is inconvenient. The West has had a role in the deteriorating relationship at the least by providing an excuse to those in power to point the finger at them and that is a lot easier to do when US enacts sanctions just as the effects of bad monetary policy which was perhaps the only angle that could have threatened the current government's poll numbers start to be felt or support for groups that literally blow up citizens all the while wrecking the region for years for their purposes.

It's a big loss, yes, but it's not unprecedented or unique. Many other cities have hard their written records destroyed, it's merely a particularly bad example of it happening.

A far, far, far better example, of a impossibly devastating historical loss was the the mass burning of the art and written records of Latin American civilizations, especially since a lot of what we had left was *in this museum*.

A lot of people don't realize that Mesoamerican cultures (Aztec, Maya, etc) were fully literate, it's in fact one of only 3 places in the world to indepedently invent true written languages. Likewise, down in the Andes (the Inca, etc), while they didn't have writing as we think of it, they used rope and knots to record information in a similar manner. And for both regions, there's way, way more then just those 3 civilizations: There's the Olmec, Mixtec, Zapotec, Purepecha, Totonac, Huastecs, Otomi, and non-Aztec Nahuas etc for Mesoamerica, and the Chavin, Wari, Tiwanku, Moche, Chimu, and Sican for the Andes, and those are just the notable ones.  Mesoamerica, for example had complex civilization for *3000 years* prior to contact with europeans, and writing for around 2000 of those years. Think of the sheer amount of literature, economic and adminstrative records, religious documents, poetry, philosophical works (and yes, we know they had these, there's some left), etc that could get made over 2000 years.

We have 16 left. 

Literal small mountains of books were burned by the Spanish. The Library of Alexandria is 1 library. *Every* library in Mesoamerica was torched, and nearly *every* individual book. [In terms of paintings, jewelry, sculpture, and crafted art, it was all almost destroyed or melted down, too.](https://imgur.com/a/0PwtEf9) It's not just a great historical loss, it's culturally and historically apocalyptic:

As /u/snickeringshadow put in a [higher level post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1ee1h9/wednesday_ama_mesoamerica/c9zep88/?st=jiul4md5&amp;sh=44c7894d) here:

&gt;From the eight surviving Mixtec codices, we can reconstruct the history of this one valley in Oaxaca going back 800 years. I think we can safely assume that had the other books survived, we would have something approaching a complete history of Mesoamerica at least going back to the Early Postclassic, and in some regions probably earlier. **Put simply, the Spanish book burning is why we talk about Mesoamerica in archaeology classes and not history classes**.

or as /u/Ahhuatl puts in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoricalWhatIf/comments/19h5ld/what_if_cortes_was_defeated_by_the_aztecs/c8o9dmt/?st=jfgjj4wl&amp;sh=de91fdad) what if post, if their works survived:

&gt;...their successors would look to the Aztecs just like modern Westerners look to Ancient Greece. For Europe, the intellectual challenge of the New World would be even more revolutionary: the abilities of the Native American mind could not be denied or rationalized away. It would have meant the injection of new arts, philosophy, mathematics, methods of agriculture, values, history, drama and more. **What we lost in the Conquest is unimaginable. Inconceivable. Akin to knowing nothing about Caesar or Confucius or Rameses beyond what color bowl they ate out of.**

We even have a taste of what this could have been: In the early colonial era, we have the Spanish commission native featherworkers to produce amazing paintings, made not of paint, [but of thousands of feathers](https://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/featherart04.jpg), so finely weaved together that [you can't even tell they aren't normal paintings](http://es.artsdot.com/ADC/Art-ImgScreen-4.nsf/O/A-8Y35WK/$FILE/Juan_bautista_cuiris-portrait_of_christ_made_of_humming_bird_and_parrot_feathers.Jpg) without a magnifying lense (or a [gigapixel photograph](http://gillesalonso.com/Messe-St-Gregoire.html)) 

If you look at modern games, movies, anime, comics, and see the massive influence and cultural mixing between the West and the East, with the amount of products and media influenced by japan etc *that's* what we lost out on: An entire third pillar of human history and culture, gone.

It makes the Library of Alexandria look like spilt milk, yet few people are even aware of this, because, sadly, the Spanish eradication did it's job: Not only are the works gone, most of the world don't realize they ever existed to begin with.

In all fairness I would say most of the world do. The main difference is that in Asia its a lot more obvious.

Im still not prejudiced in the sense that when I meet someone I refuse to judge them based on any preconceived notions. I don't assume Chinese are rude or whatever. My statement is just that racism is more common, and more obvious in Asia than in my own country (UK) and that for many the world is divided into ethnic divided or racial divides.

I speak Thai, Chinese. Most Chinese for example will never say ""you British are more sexually open"" but rather ""you foreigners are more sexually open"" 你们外国人比较开放” they will always generalise in terms of non Chinese and Chinese. Even if they do talk about nationality, its still in terms of stereotypes always as the opener of a conversation. 

Same in Thai. People will use farang to refer to all white people and generalise based on skin colour. 

Racism is quite heavily embedded in many Asian languages and where we in the west have attempted to address it by saying certain words are off limits, such is not the case in Asia. (again my experience is of Eastern and SE Asia so I limit my opinion to that region) 

And finally, your use of racist is like its a bad derogatory negative word. I'm using it in the sense that people have preconceived notions as to what people are like based on (primarily) skin colour, nationality, religion or ethnicity. 

From what I have witnessed I would comfortably say  that Asia, GENERALLY SPEAKING, is more racist than Europe in the sense that its out in the open, very common and no one even attempts to address it. It's a non issue. And I don't even think there is anything wrong with what they do. Even those who have judged me on my white skin, after a brief conversation will change their perceptions. 

It's a very different racism and like I said previously, it feels like you don't speak any Asian languages nor have you lived here for a long time. No offence if you have.

You're a closet Menshevik Trotskyist and a first-world chauvanist who thinks that undeveloped countries can't have socialist revolutions, which is a shitty white supremacist position.

Yes, Marx and Engels said that socialism should happen in the developed world first, but they were making assumptions 200 years ago, Lenin essentially updated Marxist ideas according to new global developments, acknowledging imperialism as the highest stage of capitalism. Marx is not god, he was wrong about socialism only happening in the first world, Lenin proved him wrong.

The Soviet Union most definitely did spread the revolution as best they could, they played a big role in the establishment of socialism in China, Vietnam, Korea, Cuba and Eastern Europe, among others. How would you have done any better than them? By invading Western Europe to spread the revolution to the first world? That clearly wouldn't have worked given Russia's conditions.

Of course, you're correct that socialist countries need to be developed in order to spread the revolution, which is exactly why socialism in one country was correct. Russia were the most undeveloped country in Europe and were clearly in no position to challenge the capitalist world, so Stalin proposed that they strengthen their industry, productive forces and military, and THEN spread the revolution, which they did.

The idea that socialism can only happen in the first world, as you say, is stupid and unproductive.

If the Scottish government operate at a deficit when they get more money back than they pay in, it is utterly absurd and ridiculous to suggest that they will be able to do better when they don't get that benefit. Especially as the costs to set up a new country are more than 4 times that of Scotland's GDP. 

&gt; We don't control all of our spend and tax what you call a technicality I call the main function of government. We do not borrow money we did not create the debt or the deficit we can't do that.

No, but it is a barometer of effect. If Scotland cannot utilise the powers they do have with comparative responsibilities, it is unlikely they would be able to do so later. Keep in mind that all major Scottish parties have similar, if not identicial, plans for corporation tax and VAT to that of the UK (the only two main taxes Scotland doesn't control) in the event of Independence (including the SNP) and under such plans, this would not be enough. Scotland would have to borrow so much money, and or raise taxes to unsustainable levels.

You really don't have to take my word for it though. The leg work has been done by people who do this for a living (economists).

&gt;  They underspend every year because we cant overspend and emergencies can happen for example the beast from the East.

Which comes out of the UK government emergency fund. Scotland chose to handle most of it herself, but when they couldn't cope, they were able to simply ask the UK government to send help. And it did. Snowploughs and gritters were sent from Northumberland and Cumbria and extra police were allocated from the MOD Police and nearby English constabularies to help with emergencies (As well as ambulance services and firefighters). 

Something not so easily done if you have to wade through a quagmire of red tape because the nearest neighbour is a foreign nation.

&gt; I mean do you believe that Scotland,Wales and NI are responsible for 80% of the UK deficit ? Really ? 

Did I say that? Don't think I did. I do think they are responsible for their own deficit and their proportion of the UK's deficit (Which is going down, by the way).

Nationalistic, divisive nonsense.

Fine, but we're never going to stop challenging you either.

I started in Portugal and traveled by train and car across Europe all the way to Norway. I spent Christmas there and then flew to China. From China I boarded a giant cargo ship and agreed to work as a crane operator in exchange for travel we sailed all around east Asia stopping at many different ports along the way to load and unload our cargo. Then we sailed to UAE and I even got to visit the Burj khalifa....

In Dubai we received a locked container from a very rich man. We were not allowed to look inside but the money was good so we didn’t ask any questions. We were to deliver the container immediately to Brazil. From Brazil I planned to take my share of the money and fly back to America to be with my loving family and beautiful daughter. But then a horrible thing happened. As I was lifting the container, one of the connections failed and the container fell almost 80 feet to pier below....

The container was so badly damaged that some of the contents fell into the water. The recipient became enraged and demanded to see me. The ship captain did not hesitate to turn me over into the custody of recipient. I was tied up and taken in a van to some house high up in the mountains. I have been forced into servitude to repay the value of my debt for destroying the container even though it wasn’t my fault. For the past month I have been cleaning and cooking and performing other labor ...

Around the house but they are saying that my work will never be valuable enough to make up for the damage I caused. I believe that my captors plan to sexually traffic me. I don’t know if they are serious or not...

They have been taunting me by saying I will be worth more as a woman. And normally I wouldn’t take this seriously but many of the house guests are plastic surgeons in the local area and have mentioned multiple times of transforming me. As the weeks have gone on, those conversations have become more serious. I think they are planning on doing the surgery this weekend. The main boss here has told me this is nothing personal he just wants his money back....

No offense to your gender, but I DO NOT want to become a woman. Please....I am begging you... if you can spare any money at all maybe you can help me avoid this sexual fate....so please baby, can you help me?

I can feel a lot of embarrassment for what I am asking you. This is not easy for me. I hope you can understand. The embarrassment I feel now is worth it if it saves me from a horrible future.

Je confirme en effet qu'il n'y a aucune raison économique. On ma vaguement dit un jour que c'est bien de donner un peu mais rien d'insistant ou choquant.

Ce qui me fait penser à une secte, c'est surtout le fait que tout était fait pour que l'on favorise beaucoup, voir exclusivement les relations internes. Il faut des amis chrétiens parce que les gens ""extérieurs"" risquent de t’entraîner dans des choses mauvaises. Et surtout, il faut une femme chrétienne (ou un mari, si tu es une femme).

Tu dis : 

&gt;Ils ont juste une vie communautaire non exclusive dans la société car ils partagent des valeurs et un lien personnel entre eux

C'est vrai, et comme toi j'ai envie de dire ""pourquoi pas"". Le problème c'est que cela joue énormément sur la pression psychologique et la culpabilité.

Enfant et ado, je n'ai pas vraiment pris de plaisir à aller a l'église tous les dimanches, voir plus. Sauf que ne pas y aller c'était quasiment impossible, est après on venait te faire un sermon comme quoi il fallait aller a l'église, entretenir sa foi et la communion fraternel. Je n'avais connu que cette éducation donc je culpabilisais beaucoup de ne pas vraiment avoir envie de me lever pour aller a l'église le dimanche. C'est difficile a expliquer, mais en tout cas pour un ado c'est compliqué a gérer.

Avec le recule, le fait d'être obligé de recevoir régulièrement sa ""dose"" d'église je vois ça comme une forme d'endoctrinement. Il faut que tu gardes la tête dans le guidon pour ne pas voir que tu es entré dans un cercle vicieux. 

&gt;Il y a effectivement quelque chose dans ce cas, tu peux développer le pourquoi et ce qui s'est passé ?

Même sous un pseudo anonyme c'est assez difficile. 

A cause de cette culpabilité omniprésente et du rapport a la sexualité particulier dans les églises (pas de sexe avant le mariage), j'ai eu des problèmes de développement psychologique assez sérieux avec un rapport a la sexualité compliqué, et une dépression à 22 ans.

Par exemple, j'ai notamment eu une première relation compliqué au lycée avec ma première petit amie, avec laquelle je couchais. J'étais croyant convaincu a ce moment la et je culpabilisais **énormément**, à en pleurer. Et ça c'est répété sur la quasi totalité de mes relations en tant qu'ado ou jeune adulte, jusqu'au début de ma relation actuelle, d'où la nécessité de voir un psy. 

&gt;Le fait que tu puisses en sortir simplement en y allant plus qu'il n'y ait pas de mécanismes obligatoire/agressif dans ce que tu racontes fait que j'ai du mal à voir ce qui te fait penser à une secte 

(Désolé je te cite dans le désordre, mais c'est plus logique par rapport a mes explications.) 

Outre ce que j'ai dit au dessus, j'ai quand même attendu mes 20 ans pour en sortir... Je ne pense pas que l'on puisse parler de facilité. Il y a des mécanismes d'obligations sournois qui joue sur l'aspect psychologique. ça n'est pas une secte au sens où il n'y a personne en haut de la pyramide qui récolte de l'argent sur le dos des adeptes, mais est-ce un critère obligatoire ?

&amp;#x200B;

Je précise deux choses par rapport a mon message initial : 

1 - Je ne cherche pas a la catégoriser d'office dans les sectes, même si j'ai de sérieux doutes lié a mon expérience perso. On ne t’empêche pas d'aller voir le médecin quand tu es malade, et on ne t'oblige pas a donner X % de tes revenus.

2 - Le problème se pose surtout chez les enfants et ado

I'm also using a PAL model PS3, but I'm having problems with PS1/2 (that I bought from PSN) games, the run at low and choppy FPS.

&gt; What has changed in your countries since joining the European Union?

 Traveling, studying and applying to work has became easier in other EU countries.

* Most of the neighboring countries of Hungary have a significant amount of Hungarian families that were torn apart when the current borders were drawn. With having the freedom of movement makes it easier to travel between at least two of those neighboring countries.

* This freedom was also present in economics. Others told me, many factories got closed because they were bought by their Western competitors, or got closed because they could not keep up with them coming to the market. All in all resulting unemployment for whole sub-regions. 

* I read the blog of a butcher who used to work in Hungary, then after joining the EU failed to make a living out of his profession, had to migrate to somewhere (probably Germany) to process imported Hungarian cattle that got exported back to Hungary as a foreign product. 

* Someone working in agriculture told me the EU offers money in exchange of him not planting anything, this way keeping himself out of the market from competitors.

* One benefit of the EU would be to have a stronger power when it comes to protection of people. A study backed by WHO in 2015 found that a pesticide (glyphosate) used on grains is possibly carcinogenic (makes cancer) making your cereal carcinogenic. Still in 2017 the European Union made it possible to use and trade it for 5 more years. 

* The EU has banned a pesticide in 2008 (permetrin, s-bioalletrin) which was used to make inhabited areas mosquito free. Doing that because of health concerns. Despite it, the pesticide currently used (deltamethrin) raise just as much concern of health effects.

* There was a similar story with the pesticide against ticks that was banned in 2010 because of health concerns. Still at the same time was legal to use in closed areas such as warehouses (not to mention the same amount was dangerous in thousands of square meters, but not in room like closed area).

* Talking about animals, the EU has regulated the conditions of transportation of animals. When it comes to public transportation and summer heat waves, dogs traveling conditions are better protected than an EU contributor humans'.

* Though this is all in theory, as we know EU regulations are not always followed, like protection of minority rights in Slovakia or Romania to stay on topic with Hungarians.

* Apart from these a lot of projects gained EU funding in infrastructure. I find it hard to find other changes because also a lot of things would anyway happen because of technology. I like to think of Serbia and/or Croatia as an indicator of how Hungary would do nowadays if it never joined the EU.

Police can either assume that every armed robber is nice and end up with a few extra dead civilians or they can assume that every armed robber is a violent criminal and end up with a few extra dead robbers. This is the real difference between the system we are proposing. 

If you are an armed robber, being killed by the police (or here, a citizen) is a real occupational hazard. 

&gt;You're the outlier in pretty much every statistic to do with crime, violence or policing. Either Americans are literally the worst people in the western  world, or their policing isn't done as well as it could and could be improved. 

This has a lot to do with social policy and the way things are in big cities. 

Ironically enough big cities lead the country in banning firearms and progressive policing, but it doesn't seem to help. This is because our problems with crime are mostly rooted in social issues. 

People go to terrible schools and grow up in cultures where they are surrounded by crime with no real opportunity. We also have a reprisal based prison system which fails to rehabilitate people and just creates recidivism. Not to mention the war on drugs which has forced the drug trade to become hyper violent. 

I think we could learn from Europeans in a lot of ways, but letting dangerous people *just go* is really not one of them. 

An armed robber is not a nice person. I don't know why you can't just agree here. We're not talking about a burglar who breaks into empty houses, we're not talking about a theif who steals sneakily, we're not talking about somebody who is selling drugs on a street corner, nor are we talking about somebody who commits fraud. We are talking about someone who makes a living by putting guns in people's faces and forcibly taking their things. 

You don't want armed robbers just walking around. Of course you should arrest them and rehabilitate them, but if they don't want to be taken alive, you certainly shouldn't just cast them to the wind.

As already stated, you simply can not deny the macro trends in China-Africa economics. Even if breakdown is suspect the decades picture is still one where more is happening now than it was happened 5-10-20 and so years back.  
This is what is relevant. McKinsey doesn't challenge this just because you don't agree with their reportage. To call into question the report on this trivial matter is poor form.  
You can just use another report if you don't like theirs on this domain. The graphs will show a steady rise and occasional blips because of as you say sometimes mega deals happen.  

&gt; They wrote a 60 pages report, but didn't provide context 

They like other agencies do all kinds of report tallying. 60 Page one is one which could be termed to fall under a medium length, they also do extensive ones, they might not even be publicly accessible and one have to have paid access to them.  
Then there are 10 odd pages summary reports which a lot of outlets do. 

Length is not necessarily a pro or con here. Plus their area of interest in this report was limited. And one could argue given that China-Africa field is anyway so devoid of analysis, making a 200 page report with countless tables isn't going to proliferate, i.e. disseminate information. 

Most people still aren't aware of CSIS-Rhodium groups length book/report Broken Abacus. No wonder given it is filled with technical analysis. 
It showed that Chinese are under-reporting their total GDP(not growth that is) by about 10%. Even if the report had a surprising headline to be had it got less traction because it was way too academic in setting.  

That is good but it is not by auto proxy a con on other reports out there as long as they are not just blatantly lying, which the McKinsey report is not.  

[Johns Hopkins SAIS China-Africa Research Initiative report on Debt](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5652847de4b033f56d2bdc29/t/5b84311caa4a998051e685e3/1535389980283/Briefing+Paper+1+-+August+2018+-+Final.pdf) is 10 pages. It is still illuminating. You can term this propaganda as well. Because why the heck not. Everyone wants to do business in China so everyone is compromised. Everyone.  

It also shows while there is a slight yearly decline in last 5 years, there was a massive spike in 2016 as well. These things don't need to be taken so literally and microscopically. Otherwise we have situation where doom and gloom is predicted because there is a Shanghai Index fall out there of some order.  
Calm down people. 

 &gt; The talk of Chinese companies sparring a manufacturing revolution in Africa is silly

What is even the point of this if one is going to be forcefed the context of how media reports things.  
What is revolution for you may just be trivial for someone else.  
CNN is doing a series of these articles there was [one on Ethiopia as well](https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/addis-ababa-china-construction-style/index.html). 

Even the McKinsey report doesn't say Chinese investment in Africa in manufacturing is like 60-70%. No one said that. The break down is reflective of what other experts were saying. And it is distributed and it need not be a revolution. Who cares. 

There are analysis out there which suggests given that basic Infra is a paramount condition for development and given that only really Chinese are willing to do this job for the challenges. The rest of the developed countries can just come in later and tap these African countries at that stage when they will be ready to take advantage of the next cycle of their economic development.  

This makes perfect sense, given that places like US, EU will flood in and take more higher value returns at a later date than what China can now. But this is a projection. It may or may not happen. Maybe African countries stick with China for some reason (its not debt currently as shown in other reports) maybe its just gratitude that they helped us or maybe it is because by then China would also be competitive in those higher value chain sectors to just cut under their competitions, again like they are doing now. 

&gt; McKinsey should have at least touched upon this.

There is only so much that can be done in a report of certain scale. And just because it is mentioning things which the Western media doesn't usually say actually makes it more informative not less or subject to silly conspiracy their level scrutiny for the sake of it. ONLY if what they said was a blatant lie would these things matter. 

&gt; ..that there is no debt trap ..

In Africa there isn't, the SAIS report linked above. African countries in fact owe more to Western countries but that is different because, [insert xyz].  

&gt; ..that Chinese are employing a lot of Africans...

They literally and objectively are. Just because there are 10 projects where it is not the case Does Not mean one gets to say the report is wrong or having an agenda given that the continent is having 100's to 1000s of projects and employing number of people which means Scale takes over.  

&gt; Lastly, given the extended low natural resource prices and emerging market financial crisis things will get worse for Africa. Its most likely Chinese FDI will shrink in the next 5 years, given that the Chinese government is already cutting back on its loans to African countries

That will be worse for Africa. China will make do just fine.  
McKinsey or this debate didn't even talk about the Political/Diplomatic/Strategic angle in all this. Investment and Aid (free or concessional) is not necessarily a waste even if it sees no returns. 

Judging China by Western prisms, exclusively on matters like this is flawed to begin with. With China Politics and State is supreme and holds higher hierarchy than things like the Economics and Trade. 

If China wastes $1-10 odd billion in Ethiopia or Nigeria, it may appear so on the balance sheet but to Beijing it may still be worth it in the grand scheme of things. 
Judging what happens over 4 years in China-Africa trade is just missing the point. 

And i don't even remember why this comment chain started. Looking back, the context was simple. I objected to you attempt to caricature the McKinsey report despite there being noting in the report which is factually incorrect and not already known. All it did was show the scale of some of these anecdotal dynamics, like the employment numbers, the Public-Private distribution and the details of the share of different sectors for investment.  

Had they been wrong on these, I would have shared your views about the report being trying to do something which is detached from reality. But it isn't.

And the overkill CPU and GPU i7-8705G (with HBM)


There's a Dell XPS15, too. I think over 1.5k, too.



As they ask for an i7 I'd assume you need to do some computing, so I'd go with the H-Series. I'll go with at least 4 GB VRAM and more than 60Wh of Battery.

Yes they sure did, about 3 million Polish Jews died among 3 more million Polish.

&gt; happily collaborated with the Nazis (or in many, many cases killed off their town's/village' Jews without the Nazis even asking them to) aren't just random individuals. This was a widespread problem on a massive scale in Polish society.

Can you show me some sources. I am genuinely curious. But, so far I found was an article on the Atlantic speaking about the small villages in eastern Poland.

&gt; There are well-documented incidents, particularly in the small towns of eastern Poland, where locals—acutely aware of the Nazis’ presence and emboldened by their anti-Semitic policies—carried out violent riots and murdered their Jewish neighbors. Perhaps the most infamous of these episodes was a massacre in the town of Jedwabne in summer 1941 when several hundred Jews were burned alive by their neighbors. More difficult to unpack is the tangled history of the southeastern village of Gniewczyna Łańcucka. In May 1942, non-Jewish residents of the town held hostage some two to three dozen local Jews. Over the course of several days, they tortured and raped their hostages before finally murdering them. Yet recent interviews with locals reveal that other Christian Poles in Gniewczyna Łańcucka tried to shield Jews. These and countless other episodes muddy the waters between victim and oppressor in the chaotic environment of wartime Poland.

I didn't know about that, and that's absolutely disgusting. But, that doesn't seem to me like a widespread problem on a massive scale.

First up, I'd consider the end of the British Empire a relatively controversial subject. Not because there's a raging debate about it among the UK public, but rather because there's not.

As British people we've relatively benign view of Empire, but one that's I'm afraid not entirely based on reality. 

There are a wealth of reasons why the Empire went when it did, why it happened so quickly and how it happened. However I'd seriously challenge the idea that it was totally bloodless or peaceful.

Rather I'd suggest that after initial resistance and tough lessons learnt about Britain's new post war role in the world a combination of war weariness public antipathy and economic pressures, through debts and the end of trade dominance, led success politicians and leaders to see the Empire as no longer sustainable.

But I don't think it was bloodless.

For example the Mau Mau rebellion, or Kenyan Emergency was certainly not peaceful. It lasted 4 years, or over 8 depending on what you count, and cost the lives of between 12,000 and 20,000 people. 

Equally the uprising in Malaysia caused a similar level of death over an even longer period.

However if you want to understand the full awful impact of British decolonisation then you probably want to look at India.

We may well have not fought a war to retain India (instead acquiescing to independence after a long and largely peaceful campaign of resistance) but in partition we planted the seeds for the country (or countries at partition) to under go bloody massacres, massive movements of people and death and poverty as a result. It's estimated that between 1-2 million people died because of partition with 14 million becoming refugees. All because of British policy. 

This has led to years of conflict and division in the sub-continent that still has ramifications today. It definitely wasn't peaceful.

Equally our the end of our mandate in Palestine was a period rocked by civil war and strife, with small casualties for the British, set against large losses for competing nationalist groups. 

Interestingly both of these last instances have two stark similarities. 1) educated and motivated nationalist independence movements 2) a war weary British public, Government and army unwilling to pay the price to hold on to Imperial possessions.

This pattern was repeated around the Empire as independence movements, buoyed and inspired by the example of Ghandi in India, or Aung San in Burma to negotiate an exit of the British agitated for independence themselves.

Add to points 1 &amp; 2 the massive debt the U.K. held after World War II, the crippling impact of the war on infrastructure in the UK and the insistence of the USA that, if it was to lend us money and support in WWII (see the Atlantic Charter) and afterward in our reconstruct, we open our colonies to trade and support self determination while also allowing sterling to be freely traded. This resulted in a seismic shift in the power position of the U.K. To put it bluntly the British were bankrupt, they'd won the war but lost their power, economic strength and prestige in the peace. 

So though the end of Empire wasn't as bloodless (India, Kenya &amp; Malaysia alongside others) as people often like to think it was, it did happen a lot quicker and with less resistance from the British than other Empires. 

The perfect storm of pressures upon the British state and people, led to an inability and lack of desire to hold onto its Empire. Politically and emotionally but also importantly in the resources necessary to do so.

One finally note. The British Empire, outside of predominantly ethnically Eurocentric holdings (Australia, New Zealand, Canada etc) if it was anything was an empire of trade and resources held together by a few Europeans and people of mixed heritage ruling much larger indigenous  populations. Once nationalist movements started to grow and gain a voice and be inspired by each other, and through the shrinking of the world (though easier communication such as newspaper, radio and books) started to talk to each other, the writing was on the wall.

After the huge blows dealt to British economic, military and cultural power by WWII and the settlement afterwards many came to believe that to hold on to the Empire was futile.

And just to throw one last car amongst the pigeons, combine this with a working class Labour Party and sometime Government instinctively anti-Imperial taking a new role in British politics and a very real threat of a new war with the Soviet Union and retaining  Empire all of a sudden seemed a much lower priority.

&gt;Admittedly, I was a fan of Shadder2K during Team Liquid's last-to-2nd-place run in NA Contenders season 1 2017. Back then, he flexed on a decent set of heroes, and injected vitality into an aging, veteran team. Fast forward till now though, as much as people called for him and fellow Gigantti players to be in OWL, there's little to convince me that Shadder2K is OWL-ready. On paper he is a flex DPS that can play a wide pool of heroes across the hitscan and projectile role. But in EU Contenders, he has been mostly stuck on Brigritte and Hanzo. Signing a flex DPS based on 2 heroes is a risky gamble to take. Team Gigantti's surprise elimination vs Eagle Gaming in the semis, a team that have no OWL hype, also has put a dent into his stock somewhat. Maybe in the next season Shadder can show that he is truly a flex DPS that can play a wide hero pool, but for now from this perspective he is a gamble that i'd not advise to take.

I think that you're making too much of the heroes he's played for Gigantti. Many players in the history of the game have been forced to specialize despite boasting a wide**r** hero pool, especially in the meta where 3-3 comps and double sniper comps reign supreme. I also feel that this is a concern that can easily be alleviated in the tryouts process, and doesn't require him to wait another year for his shot at the top tier of Overwatch competition.

To whisk through a couple of them, 'threshold' is a derivative of an Old English term, from which the verb 'to thresh' is also derived. The term does not however 'hold the thresh'. Wealthy houses would likely have rugs, and by the Tudor period wooden panelling was increasingly popular. Poorer households could have straw, but more likely reeds, which were cheap and abundant.

This post seemingly overlooks the overwhelmingly agrarian and rural nature of most of British, if not European, society in the 16th Century, which renders many of its points moot. Thatched rooves were extremely popular because their materials are cheap and plentiful, and they are extremely dry and well-insulating. Thatch does, however, have to be changed every few years to prevent the build-up of gasses leading to fires. A thatched roof that leaked on you, or was loosely packed enough to allow large infestations, was a thatched roof that would get replaced. And the idea of having dogs on the roof is just bizarre.

Bread, if not baked at home, was often baked in communal ovens within a village. While rents before the enclosure acts could often be paid in kind, the idea of slicing up an individual loaf to share around multiple households is again bizarre. Pigs are extremely common animals in medieval and early modern agricultural settings, and it was very common for households to own one. They could be purchased cheaply, fed on scraps throughout the year and then butchered, with any surplus sold to pay for a new piglet.

Parish rolls were kept throughout the Medieval and Early Modern period and keep a record of all marriages, births and deaths in a given parish. Marriages are far from limited to June.

Interesting, but it's hard to address any of it considering I haven't even read Nietzsche let alone the rest (perhaps I'll dust off the Nietzsche Reader on my shelf). 

&gt; It was through them that you had a concentrated rise of rational consciousness and therefrom Faustianism, culminating in Copernicus and Descartes.

Can 'rational consciousness' be disconnected from intelligence? Are they not virtually equivalent expressions? When did the Western and Eastern Indo-Europeans diverge IQ wise? So the East Asians posess lesser rational consciousness? 

&gt; Technology is our defiant attempt to deal with what is called the 'Lacanian real', which is just a fancy way of saying that which is yet intelligible and utter, and this technology has become a medium of transcendence, really almost now a religion.

You're saying that without the lust for a psycho-cultural coping mechanism modernity would never have occured? 

The first technological revolution that separated the West from the East (China) was in firearms. The Chinese were the first to invent and utilise guns but innovation stagnated due to the nature of their wars. They had to cope with steppe raiders so their generals invested in horses and the great wall instead, wheras the Europeans with its broken landscape and fortresses were induced to develop efficient guns and powerful artillery. 

In terms of the present, this infatuation with AI has always struck me as anti-humanism in yet another guise. The idea that AI will one day trump human intelligence misunderstands the nature of intelligence, which requires machiavellean sociality to drive it, and therefore the notion that AI could ever run amok is asinine.

&gt;  There are myths of male warriors rising up and overthrowing female-dominated religions, where the men could begin to rationally perceive they were being deceived by the women (e.g. wearing of masks—who knows if the women themselves comprehended all of what they were doing), and so they revolted and killed all women but the younger ones, who were then raised in a different mythos.

I know that female chimps actually delay ovulation when they're randomly mating (for group stability) so that they can conceive with their chosen partner (hypergamy, of course). They will literally sneak off into the forest with their consorts. Half the offspring in a troop are sired this way. If caught the reprucussions are usually violent. So I guess female duplicity has deep roots. Is that the type you're talking about? Was the disdain of women an egalitarian backlash to their crypto polygamy? Was this when monogamous relations (which overall favour men) started to be ruthlessly enforced?

Btw, my post a while ago about mongamy being egalitarian wasn't to suggest that you, the aristocrat, ought to embrace polygamy. My point was that if some *social* egalitarianism is necessary for cohesion then some *political* egalitarianism might be necessary, too. If monogamy's fundamental purpose is to disinsentivize revolt, then what of democracy's fundamental purpose?

&gt; women can only represent mythical and magical consciousness which we men have already conquered.

It's cute how parasitical women are. As if they could ever form the requisite hierarchies necessary for civilization.

&gt;  Some New Agers want to correct Modernism by going back to mythical consciousness

How would that even work? Wouldn't it necessitate a cognitive retrogression?

&gt; not having a problem with the Faustianism evident in Western Europe

Well good, because 'faustianism' is clearly adaptive.

&gt; My war with Modernity is not a hatred for what must be, but precisely the participation in it.

Hate is the muse of history. 

&gt; Idealism, which has always been the bedrock of absolutism. 

Absolutism = war. There's no need for it unless you're conquering (or being conquered). And it's the beginning of the end as soon as the conquering ceases. Early modern absolutism was a useful tool to quickly generate revenues (taxes) and unity which became obsolete when the Dutch and Anglos pioneered the sale of govt debt (bonds). Absolutist France was a bankrupt mess throughout the 18th century.

&gt; There's always been a massive correlation between Idealists and absolutists.

So why the white trash interpretation of Nazism?

&gt; just as scientism has highly correlated with meek liberalism and the bourgeois Last Man.

Hayek, the self-professed Whig, spent a career combatting scientism. A distinction can be made between Anglo (Hume) and French rationality (Descartes), Anglo (Burke) and French individualism (Rousseau). It was the French enlightenment that led to communism.

I agree the West could do with a dose of authoritarianism and idealism, but the issue with dismissing democratic-liberalism as 'meek' is that the aristocratic-chivalry that proceeded it was a near psychopathic hotbed of violence and drudgery. The medieval murder rate in W.Europe was 1/100. That's unacceptable. That's rank failure. Institutions do matter (were the East Germans inferior to West Germans?). It was only when warrior nobility was neutered that things began to civilize. It was its replacement with a court based aristocracy and bourgeoisie that generated the civility (which trickled down to the masses) that we see today. The upper classes were forced to reign in their impulses. So democratic-liberalism is an astonishing achievment. It requires unholy amounts of trust and impulse control for it to function. It is absolutely a demonstration of Western greatness, not its decadence.

Considering the state of the republic, by his third or fourth term people were beginning to tire of him and he was frankly getting tired of the office. Compared to the more balanced and non-partisan way he ran his first administration, Washington begins to become far more bitter and pro-Federalist by his second administration. By his third (and possibly fourth term) his presidency would become more and more blatantly Federalist and anti-Republican. We would see a version of the Alien and Sedition Acts as well as a much more aggressive response to France.

However, with Washington's death c. 1801, the country is thrown into chaos. Not only are we smack dab in the middle of a dangerous conflict with France leading to war, but we are also a brand new republic that has never had any leader but Washington. In OTL by the time the first president dies in office in 1841, we had already established a precedent of what the office is designed to look like and have a notion that the office is designed to be rotated between individuals. With Washington dying, the fights over succession become even more chaotic. Does the Vice-President become president? Acting president? Regency council until the next election? A bitter partisan environment made worse by Washington remaining in office would add venom to an already infected wound. Civil war between successors is an entirely realistic possibility.

With bitter England and an incensed French republic eyeing the United States tearing itself apart, they would swoop in to take advantage. Some of the more conservative voices would probably advocate for some reunion with Great Britain, whereas the more radical would support an intimate relationship with the French republic.

Thus, it is likely that another world war breaks out akin to the Seven Years War, with the American continent becoming a battleground for the larger revolutionary fights in Europe.

&gt; 
&gt; That's a remain voter, wanting unspecified reforms, in a direction that is counter to the direction the EU is taking. Do you think they'd have gotten anything close to what they wanted from a 'remain' result?

Well luckily that is the default position thanks to the fact we had an opt out agreed on ever closer union and militarily we always had a veto. 

&gt; Why not? It's exactly the same position, you can present it in exactly the same terms, it was remain promising everything under the sun, all the benefits with none of the responsibilities... We could be in the EU but limit immigration, not integrate further, there wouldn't be any defence initiatives and so on and so forth, while others were arguing the opposite.

It's just not the same though, these are things that already existed and we already had so a vote for remain was a vote for these things. It's totally different to saying different and entirely contradictory things like 'we can remain in the single market and make our own trade deals'.


&gt; The EC has a fantastic website that lets you search spending by all sorts of metrics, but for now I assume that this press release from the EC will do? It's faily near the bottom. £16.1m spent by remain, £11.5 by leave, and that excludes the '£9 million' in leaflets by the government.

Right but none of the remain entities broke the rules by spending more than 7 million, like the official leave campaign did and I notice that 'be leave' isn't listed on there.

I don't know why you leavers keep going on about that leaflet that set out the government's position, it was outside the campaign dates therefore it wasn't election spending, simple as that. Unless you want to try and total up how much money all that negative press printed in all the tabloids for 30 years is worth?

&gt; So it basically comes down to you not being able to see past your own opinions. Great.

No it comes down to the fact that you and nobody like you has ever actually given a legitimate Brexit benefit. Your own attempt was also one of the most pathetic I have to say.

&gt; You don't think that's important? Fair enough, but I do, and quite a lot of other people do too.

Important? I think we should leave so we can leave? that's what you said, yeah, sorry mate but that's utterly shite reasoning.

&gt; How is it not a benefit? What you mean is that you do not see it as a benefit, that isn't the same thing. Seriously, how blinkered do you have to be to utterly ignore the fact that other people may not have the same views you do? It's utterly bizarre, and no-wonder that people are confused.

Because it's not a benefit, you are describing the action of leaving the EU and not the benefits that will supposedly provide.

&gt; It shows that in some polls remain is ahead by about the same amount it was before the referendum, but that in other months it is behind more than it was during the referendum, and that we again have more people who don't know how they would vote. If you consider the margin of error it essentially shows that nothing has changed since the referendum in terms of vote.

The result itself was within a margin of error, run it on another day and it could have been the other way by that thinking we should just run it again just to be sure then eh?


&gt; There is uncertainty, until we leave (either with or without an agreement) there will continue to be uncertainty. We solve that uncertainty when we have a clear path forward (which hopefully means an agreement, but we'll see). The point however is that the impact of leaving the EU is going to be relatively minor in economic terms, to the point that it'll take a while for any benefits or negatives to be properly weighed.

Hahaha, okay then, source for that?

Governments own reports hugely disagree with you to the point where they won't even release the worst case scenario which seems to be the one we are heading towards and also the one you seem to be advocating.

In any case, it's supposed to be better than what we have now, you supposedly have some benefits you can list. I'm still waiting.

&gt; Have you actually read them? Because if you had you'd have a better appreciation as to what people are talking about. Ever wonder why two newspapers can take the same source report and make it look wildly different without actually lying about stuff? It's because you can push one particular element, or combine unrelated aspects, or take worst vs best case scenarios.

Yeah I've read a lot about it, certainly enough to know that the idea that the impact will be minor and temporary is laughable. Just because the daily Mail and the fucking Express paint it as all rosy does not mean it's worth a damn thing and it does not mean that 'it must be somewhere between what both sides say' at all.


&gt; What really annoys me though is that people are making themselves feel better by painting the leave side as ignorant, ignoring data and experts etc.. and then wildly misunderstanding, or misrepresenting the actual data and experts.

Yeah well you are, otherwise you can give me some proper meaningful tangible benefits to leaving that we can expect to see when we leave. If you can't do that, which I am sure you cannot then you are just wilfully rolling the dice on nothing but pure faith and you deserve to be mocked.

&gt; Although clearly that is more fun. Take the one from today and look at the underlying reporting, is there a risk? Yes, is it major? No. Would most people notice? Probably not.

What a joke, I don't know about you but I've already noticed the rising cost of living. Food is more expensive, holidays more expensive and it's only going to get worse, because as I say... THERE ARE NO BENEFITS.

&gt; Right thinking? Come on. Although I applaud you for working toward a goal you believe in. I doubt you'll get there and obviously will try to achieve what I'd like to see, but it is good that people are engaged. I do wish they were a little better informed though.

Yes right thinking, exactly.


&gt; You have different priorities, that's great, you go.

Not at all, you have failed to define any benefits but there are many many demonstrable negatives.

&gt; once the UK is out of the EU, things will already be better. 

How exactly, be specific and based on what evidence?

&gt; In economic terms I see leaving the EU as a positive in the long term, but I'm not suggesting we should leave the EU because of the economics in the first place.

Utterly vague shite, how long is long term?

&gt; Oh and this isn't a game, I'm not going to laugh at the likes of you and say I fucking told you so, in a years time, when we are out of the EU, because there will be other issues that need dealing with etc..

You won't be. You will be nowhere to be seen, I've no doubt.

&gt; This isn't some childish squabble, and there is no right answer. 

Disagree, there is a right answer and taking an unnecessary million to 1 gamble for no benefits is not it.

&gt;  I'm advocating the position that I think is right for the country generally

But you can't tell me what the benefits are and how long they will taker to appear, it's pure faith based wishful thinking guesswork.

So hey

You said:

That’s a general statement about “the” spat, not “a” spat, with the Iran deal as the cause of the spat. I see what you meant to say now, but I was responding to what you said.

Yeah, Iran, Syria, Hamas, and Hezbollah all work together.

Anyone can form a political party in a parliamentary system. There are fascist parties that want to bring back Nazism too. Does that mean they have a Nazi problem? 

Nobody’s tearing down churches. Nobody’s destroying icons at churches (and if they do, they get charged and punished). Schools still teach in the native language and not Arabic. They still have their holidays. Kids are still taught about their traditional heroes. Western science and technology hasn’t disappeared. Western media and music is still the same. People still dance and sing and play instruments. 

We Americans said the same thing when the Irish, Italians, and Jews came to America: that they were changing the culture, they’d never assimilate, and that good Protestant American culture was dead. 

Western culture and politics has had global hegemony for centuries and it’s not going anywhere thanks to our media and American military domination. 

The first generation immigrants probably won’t assimilate, but the second generation will thanks to being raised in a western country. They can live in an Arab neighborhood all they want, but the media they watch, read, listen to, and learn about in school will be western. Even if they go to a private Muslim school, they’ll still be exposed to western culture especially for higher education. It’s impossible to completely cloister the second generation from assimilation. By the third generation, they’ll be completely assimilated. Also, even in supposedly “Muslim majority” Sweden, most second generation immigrants are atheists because, again, local culture is very irreligious. And it doesn’t even matter because the largest growing religion in Scandinavia is Catholicism.

As an american student in a german school (I was living in Europe at the time), racism was a bit of an issue as all the kids were still drawing swastikas everywhere: On the ground, the walls, the toilets, my desk... You name it. When the teachers weren't around, I would get beaten up because I was an american, one of those who killed their grandparents. I was guilty. Even though I didn't understand why they hated my, I thought it was all my fault, and didn't know what to do aside from just sucking it up.  
One day I was going home, walking in the main avenue, where I saw my dad in his car, giving what seemed to be 100 bucks to a woman in provocative dressing. Noticing me, he signed me to come. ""Why did you gave money to the woman dad, do you teach her how to use money too?"" I asked; ""Son, money can buy you services, get people to do the things you want them to do. This woman helped your dad to relieve his stress from work"". With a pat on my head, he let me get into the car and go home with him.  
I couldn't sleep that night; rewinding everything he said in my head, trying to understand what he meant. ""Does that mean I can pay the other kids at school to stop beating me?"" I kept wondering. I decided to try it out.  
Next morning when I went to school, I took half of the money I accumulated, which was about $50. As I came close to the school's gate, a group of five classmates, four boys and one girl, blocked me the path. The oldest of the group, a blue eyed blonde jewish fat kid named Franzis, came at me, boasting his chest and told me ""Suck meinen Schwanz, Dummkopf"". Shaking, I kept my calm, breathed in and out calmly; and then pulled out a ten dollar bill and said ""No u"".  
Suddenly, both his knees bent and he started unzipping my pant. As he followed my order, I turned to the other four kids, who all were in shock. I pulled out my wallet with my right hand, and let the money slowly fall out from it. At the exact moment the 40 other dollars landed on the ground, the kids eyes revulsed, turning whiter than my neighbourhood. They then all started getting undressed. As I realised what my dad told me was right, I removed my clothes, getting ready to enjoy the power of money. Shortly after, I was laying naked on the ground, with a guys head between my legs, giving me a nice feeling of the deepest depht of his throat. As he was gagging on my Bratwurst, the other guys locked my arms and my legs on the ground, as girl inserted her buttcheeks over my nose, completely capturing it inside her void. She then exhaled from her back end what was the product of a strict regime of cabbage; I could feel the fire and the mud fill my lungs and my bloodstream, slowly turning me into a half cabbage, half shit being. After unplugging herself from my nose, she slowly stood up, alongside of all the other kids; and suddenly BLAM, they all collapsed on the ground.  
Amazed and afraid from what I just experienced, I ran home, ready to thank my dad for how much he teached me. As I got close to the door, ready to ring the bell, the door unexpectedly opened, and behind it was my dad, smiling.  
""Dad, you are right, money can make people do whatever you want them to!"" I exclamated, ""Son, never have I been so proud of you; it seems like you've finally become a grown up"" he tenderly answered. After searching in his pocket for a bit, he pulled out a $50 bill, and extented his arm towards me. ""But dad, this is too much money, you only give me 10 bucks for pocket money"" I said, curious as to why he was giving me so much. A grin appeared on his face, ""Son, it is because I am buying a service from you"". And thereafter he shoved his whole arm inside my rear, turning me into a puppet piloted by his hand that was lodged inside my guts. He then broke my mouth on his 12 inch Blutwurst, drowning me in gallons of white water.

That has consequences as far as the ease of dealing with a thing is concerned, but not directly with the effect of the thing.

I understand that but ""crimes committed by various non-white groups within Europe"" isn't some small, irrelevant thing to be brushed off as inconsequential ala. your zombie analogy. That criteria would include almost all of the worst terrorist attacks in Europe of the last 15 years.

&gt;And as far as your immigration issue, that has negative consequences and externalities also. Migrants are people, too, and they don't disappear just because you can't see them.

I never claimed they weren't people. But the question of their humanity is irrelevant to the question of ""Is it in the interests of the people of Europe to invite them to live with us? Is there a moral case to be made for excluding them?"" I believe the answers to those questions are ""No"" and ""Yes"" respectively.

&gt;And the kind of society that closes borders completely and the effect of that isolationism may be bad, too.

I'm not arguing for isolationism.

This link mentions the sacrifice of children and in general how people were chosen for sacrifice. A lot of the terms are gender neutral such as captives and stuff although some specifically say warriors which would have to mean men.

&gt;The problem is that even when renewables produce enough energy to supply all of the country’s electricity, the variability of the renewables means Germany has to keep the coal plants running, over half of which use the dirtiest of all coal, lignite.

&gt;In fact, in 2016, 7 out of 10 of Europe’s biggest polluters were German lignite power plants.

He wanted the man dead or alive, so Fett set out to collect his bounty. This target was peculiar though. He wasn't a force user, yet Vader declared him a dangerous man. At least he knew who to call for the job.

The Slave I orbited the blue and green planet, with Fett staring around himself in the cockpit. The area where his target was in was a cold landscape similar to Hoth, but with more trees. Fett landed the Slave I on an empty spot with no cliffs or trees.

Fett traversed the landscape preparing himself for his target. Fett stopped near a rock and zoomed with his scope, he spotted his target. A bearded man who's skin was as white as the snow, next to him a small boy with a hunting bow. His target had a large battleaxe in his hands. Fett prepared a trip, swiftly and stealth-fully heading down to the snow, where he'd place a few explosives, he'd go back to his rock spot, keeping his head down in the snow. After the man came into sight, Fett click a small device in his hands, causing the explosives to go off. The small boy yelled, but he could not make out what he said. Unexpectedly, his target rushed through the smoke, before stopping. Fett activated his jetpack flying through the air and firing the EE-3 at the man, who barley ducked out of the way.

Fett landed, continuing to fire at the man, who swung the battleaxe which stopped some of the blaster bolts. The man rushed towards Fett an a graceful speed, elbowing him, which sent Fett flying away into a snowy rock.

With his jetpack damaged and slightly injured, Fett took out one of his WESTAR blaster pistols and began firing at the man, who was hit in the shoulder. With the man grabbing his shoulder, Fett fired a grappling hook from his arm, it slinging around the man's legs, tying them together.

Fett pulled on his grappling hook, the man falling to the ground, being pulled towards Fett who aimed his WESTAR blaster pistol at the man's head. ""I think you'll be coming with me, I want to keep Lord Vader impressed after all.."" Fett spoke to the man, pressing the WESTAR to his skull. Unexpectedly however, his target threw his fist out hitting Fett in the chest, which sent him flying back onto another rock.

Fett was disoriented by this point, grabbing his helmet with his hand, trying to regain his vision. However he felt the man grab him, tossing him onto the cold snowy floor.

Fett regained his vision, trying to stand, though the man wasn't finished yet, grabbing Fett's shoulder and yanking him, before tossing Fett once again.

The man known as 'Kratos' stood over Boba Fett ready to kill him. However Fett's ship rose from the ground and fired, which sent Kratos flying back. Fett's armor absorbed the shrapnel as he slowly stood. He soon saw Kratos rushing towards him, which caused Fett to aim up his arm, spewing flames into the face of Kratos, in which Kratos stepped back, turning around with his hands on his face.


Fett fired the rocket on his slightly broken jetpack, which collided with the back of Kratos. This sent him colliding with a large boulder in front of him.

Fett glided to his Slave I, climbing into the cockpit, in which he fired a few more blasts into the boulder in which Kratos was propped up against, Fett recording the ordeal to show Vader that he did in fact kill his target.

Fett flew off into space with the Slave I, though...What he did not know was that Kratos had survived.

Chomsky is overrated. There are plenty of earlier critiques of Capitalism that make the same points as him, the only difference being that Chomsky just happened to be the right place at the right time. There is a reason why we don't hear about him here in Europe, because all of his points were made by figure back when he was a kid, or even before he was born. Chomsky is only regurgitating old Socialist thought to young ears. His intellectual value is questionable at best, considering that his audience isn't the workers, but mostly students, who then continue to take their education, and at best themselves become armchair anarchists, leaving behind their activism when they leave their education. 

I only now started on a University education, after getting a traditional labour job at a brewery right out of my Gymnasiumial education, and I see this all around me. Plenty of fired up ideologues, but no activists. They come out for May Day and that's it. They join Yellow Unions, and say ""it's the same"". They praise the Liberal turns in the Social Democratic party, saying that it ""at least still helps the workers"".

Calling Chomsky the most Prominent Libertarian Socialist of the 20th century is a direct insult to people like Luxemburg, Korsch, Reich, Rühle, Durruti, Hoffmann, Debord, and many others far more prominent thinkers. Hell, I wouldn't even consider Chomsky the most prominent American Libertarian Socialist of the 20th century, when you also have figures like Mattick, Day, Boggs, Thomson, and Bookchin.

Chomsky was only lucky to be picked out by the media. He is nothing more than a lucky face among many possible. To claim that Chomsky hasn't been given opportunities is wrong as well. He has been literally spoon fed from the day he was born. He has had plenty of time to throw himself into active Labour party politics.

I have a small child so I am well aware of what daycare costs. Cursory Google searches confirm it averages $10 to $12k a year for full time. That's not $20k, and many people have family that help, or they jigger work schedules to reduce the cost. Also, people have no choice about needing daycare. They do have a choice about shelling out major cash for high school.

The sheer number of courses may not be equal, but the quality of education is likely of similar quality. There are lots of  clubs, sports, trips, internships, etc. Did your school have a marching band? Varsity football? Clubs that go to Europe, Africa, Asia? My local high school does.

Dallas was a random choice. You can look at other major districts. All offer enough to get you into an Ivy. And guess what? No one cares where you went to high school. College is what mattered. Most of my friends in college went to public school. I'm on mobile, but I have a strong feeling that diversity of life experience counts as much as AP classes. 

And education is far more than just a academics. It's interacting with many different kinds of people, lots of different extrcurriculars, volunteer work  etc. I bet colleges look at applicants from rough, large urban high schools who take those 7 AP classes, are in honor society, play an instrument or sing, are in an academic club or two, write for the newspaper, and/or play a sport, plus a part time job.

It's not only about AP classes. I will have to look at percentages of college admissions of public v. private school students. I'm betting they are looking for a diverse student body, not just people who can afford private school.

IMHO a 2nd referendum would just increase the likelihood of a no deal / cliff edge Brexit, because it would mean that whatever UK and EU negotiated would be thrown out.

It's more expensive than the Hitachi because it's simply an overall better toy.

The EMW is more rumbly than the Doxy, and it's less numbing/buzzy particularly on the lower settings. It's much less heavy and cumbersome than the Die Cast version. Hitachi attachments fit perfectly.

&gt;The deficit going up isn't that big of a deal as long as we can support it.

But we can't without taking from the poor to give to the rich. That's why it's a big deal.

&gt;And the republicans aren't going to cut entitlements as they know their voters rely on them too much especially the elderly.

 * *House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said Wednesday that congressional Republicans will aim next year to reduce spending on both federal health care and anti-poverty programs, citing the need to reduce America's deficit.*

  *“We're going to have to get back next year at entitlement reform, which is how you tackle the debt and the deficit,” Ryan said during an appearance on Ross Kaminsky's talk radio show.*

  * *Based on recent and past statements from various GOP lawmakers, the concern is warranted. Just this week, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy signaled that changes to entitlement programs could help tackle the deficit.*

  *""I worry about deficits, but you're not going to get out of this problem until you grow the economy,"" McCarthy said Monday, on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""*

  *""Then, you've got to look at the entitlements,"" he added.*

Right.

&gt;No they don't understand what income inequality means they only know it exists.

Evidently you don't.

&gt;And how the hell is the middle class living paycheck to paycheck. I swear this sub is getting worse and worse in spewing things that are not factual.

[Survey: Three-Quarters of Americans Live Paycheck-to-Paycheck](https://www.cebglobal.com/talentdaily/three-quarters-americans-paycheck-to-paycheck/)

Sometimes when a large group of people looks dumb to you, it might just be that you're the one who's wrong, and they're the ones who are right.

&gt; Most Americans are financially illiterate. So it's no wonder you see so many in debt and what have you when they don't understand how things like credit works. 

So which is it? Are they *not* living paycheck to paycheck, or *are* they living paycheck to paycheck, but it's because they're all dumb?

&gt;The problem isn't asking for a fair share, its the whole entitlement of it all and that in my opinion asking for more than a fair share.

It's funny how we consistently have the worst income inequality in the West, removed from the average by a *large* margin, we work more hours in a year than the OECD average, and *a lot* more than people in Western European countries, we have fewer workers' protections, lower bottom wages, and less job security than our Western European peers, almost all of which live in countries that are poorer than ours yet have more entitlements and welfare programs for the poor, and *still* you think that American workers asking for more is asking for too much.

&gt;As explain to me why a job that takes 30 minutes to learn should be paid $15/hr? Justify that without using any sort of morals or moral appeal.

It stops Putin and his restricted inner circle of oligarchs from doing what they've done from the day he took office - stealing in Russia and spending in the West.


&gt;The big guns came out when the US penalized some Russian oil and gas companies and banks. Those measures meant that Russia and its companies could no longer, for example, work with American companies on lucrative oil operations in the Arctic.

&gt;Russia has more than $8 trillion worth of untapped oil and gas, but it needs sophisticated technology and services from Western countries to actually extract it. As my colleague Brad Plumer reports, in the runup to 2014 sanctions, Exxon, led by Tillerson, and Russia’s oil giant Rosneft invested $3.2 billion in a project in the Kara Sea in the Arctic — a region that Rosneft estimated could have more oil than the entire Gulf of Mexico. But the sanctions foiled that deal, and deprived both Exxon and Russia of an enormous sum of money.

&gt;But the most damaging aspect of the sanctions has probably been that debt-heavy Russian banks lost the ability to borrow money from US banks, pushing them into a serious cash crunch, which in turn has had a ripple effect on the country’s economy. The power of the penalties has been compounded dramatically by the fact that American allies in Europe and elsewhere have joined in on them as well. In 2015, Russia estimated that Western sanctions cost its economy more than $100 billion[1](https://www.vox.com/world/2016/12/23/14028546/trump-lift-russia-sanctions) — by this point, it’s likely to have cost many billions more.

If you truly don't understand someone's motivation, money is always a safe bet.

I mean, we have Black History Month, but... I think that *may* have the opposite of its intended effect of assuaging this.

Since people are looking to find *themselves*, telling them the history of others of the same color (who may or may not have anything to do with their story) doesn't seem all that helpful.  And I'm using the word ""history"" lightly.  The ""history"" in Black History Month is generally limited to slavery and post-slavery history.  Generally, it's limited in scope to M.L.K. *et. al.*, how awful whites were to blacks in America, and whichever small selection of random noteworthy individuals they've picked out that year (usually modern figures *in Africa* who have *nothing* to do with American black individuals).

It just generates hate, in my opinion, because it enforces the idea that ""former slave"" and ""displaced from Africa"" is the permanent black identity and that anyone noteworthy is a ""random outlier"" who happens to have a neat story.

To be entirely fair, the Eurocentric view is the only view European descendants really have to offer, as that's the side of the story they and their ancestry saw.  If I had an Afrocentric viewpoint, I'd give it in a heartbeat.

I think the thing to do to move forward is to realize that history isn't static.  A lot of the history of black culture is lost, partly because of European interference and partly because of Africa having passed down traditions orally that are now unrecoverable.  There's just no way to link them to their pre-slavery past.  It shattered their connection to Africa. But it's not the *end* of history.  Long in the future, American slavery will be more of a footnote or interesting fact than the event we see it as, because black Americans will have forged their own new histories that they can directly identify to, rather than desperately trying to tie them to cultures in Africa that they no longer fit into and seeing themselves as nothing but former slaves.",False,False,False,,0,1536012726,,1536013007,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e5cd6d6,False,t3_9cc4le,True,t1_e5b7s0z,/r/CringeAnarchy/comments/9cc4le/this_is_not_the_way_good_movies_are_made/e5cd6d6/,,1539717800,1,True,False,CringeAnarchy,t5_35j1r,r/CringeAnarchy,public,,False

Population replacements happened countless times in Europe.

The major ones are the replacement of local hunter-gatherers with Anatolian farmers, who in some places displaced them completely, while in others mixed with them (however the mixture was at most 10%, suggesting that they were genocided or that the farmers surpassed them numerically by a very large margin). 

Then the farmers in their turn were replaced with steppe pastoralists from the Pontic-Caspian steppe. 

In cases like Southeastern Europe, the incursions weren't as widespread, so people from Romania for example can be modelled as roughly 60/40 steppe (same for Bulgarians, Serbs, while Greeks and Albanians are like 60/40 farmers). Sardinians being the most isolated, were almost untouched by the steppe migrations from the Bronze Age, and to this day they are close to 90% farmers. In Hungary if I'm not mistaken the proportion is like 75/25 in favour of the steppe pastoralists, while in places along the Northern European plain, all the way into Britain, the farmers were pretty much replaced altogether (around 90/10). 

And that's just touching the subject on a very macro level, but the idea is that gigantic migrations happened on a number of occassions and in some cases it brought population replacements with them.

I am not against manufacturing in lower cost countries if it is done ethically and with a progressive commitment: the intention of the company must always be to grow with the country, not merely to exploit it for its labor and then move on to the next cheapest place. I am not sure that Nike meets that criteria, and it reminds me of that interview that I read with Anand Giridharadas in New York Magazine.

Anyway, the year is 2185. Earth has been ecologically ravaged, and is home to 25 billion people. Another 20 billion now living off-world, on every celestial body in the Solar System, as far away as the cold and distant Kuiper Belt and even the Oort Cloud. 90% of the human population has some form of augmentation, be they biomods or cybernetics. 10% of the Solar System’s 45 billion humans have 100% cybernetics, and 10% of that 45 billion have *no* augmentations at all, but the vast majority have at least *one* augmentation. It has been 84 years since the **Unified Earth Government** (more commonly referred to as **EarthGov**) unified the planet in World War V, and only with backing by the power of EarthGov’s four-billion-man army – the **Peace Force** - has any progress been made to repair Earth’s global ecosystem. 

All countries on Earth are members of EarthGov. There is one military (as already mentioned), one currency (the Terra), one confederal court (the **EarthGov Court of Justice**), and all borders are open. Every member-country and colony of EarthGov sends representatives to the colossal EarthGov Parliament (based in EarthGov’s capital, **Mundus**, located on Cyprus), though the Parliament’s will can be overridden by the Executive Council – a permanent group of seventeen latter-day nobles, who are the *de facto* leaders of EarthGov, and the masters of humanity. Each constituent nation and colony of EarthGov retains a considerable degree of control over their internal affairs, though at the end of the day, EarthGov reserves the right to intervene for any reason, and there are clear parameters that member states are not permitted to deviate from.

A lot of East-Asian dishes, you could try mixing some Paprika &amp; Ground Ginger, half &amp; half,   


For South Asian, I'll usually cut out the chili all together, substituting with a Bell pepper if Fresh. Sometimes I'll substitute the Chili powder for some Mild Garam Masala. You could try paprika, but make sure it isn't the smoky kind.  


In terms of Indochina, I find it best to just cut out the chili, of course you can try other things, but I don't suggest it.  


I'm not sure about Africa I'm just gonna say just don't use smoked unless the recipe calls for smoked pepper.  


Lastly North-Eastern South America. I suggest you mix allspice with the unsmoked paprika for all of the  places, except Guyana, the only place I'm really qualified to talk about.   


I've never liked spicy, my friends say I've got a really high spice tolerance though so take this cautiously. As far as I know, My Grandmas didn't add Chili, though I think they did. They would never substitute it, but they would use less, there was usually a reduced pot and a full spice on the table.

An exception is the Assyrian calendar used in Iraq and the Levant, which is inherited from Classical Arabic that correspond to roughly the same time of year.The Gregorian calendar is and has been used in nearly all the countries of the Arab world, in many places long before European occupation of some of them. All Arab states use the Gregorian calendar for civil purposes. The names of the Gregorian months as used in Egypt, Sudan, and Yemen are widely regarded as standard across the Arab world, although the Syro-Mesopotamian names are often used alongside them.

First, lets look at the text from the [""Agreement of Mutual Assistance between the United Kingdom and Poland, Aug. 25, 1939""](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Agreement_of_Mutual_Assistance_between_the_United_Kingdom_and_Poland-London_(1939\)).

Although the phrase *""Should one of the Contracting Parties become engaged in hostilities with a European Power in consequence of aggression by the latter against that Contracting Party, the other Contracting Party will at once give the Contracting Party engaged in hostilities all the support and assistance in its power""* would seem to be straightforward, it really isn't! There was also the Secret Protocol which stated that ""European Power"" was little more than a euphemism for Germany, and that if *another* power invaded *""the Contracting Parties will consult together on the measures to be taken in common.""*

So yeah, there was a big, glaring caveat, and while the invasion on Sept. 1st saw Britain fulfil what was a clearly stated obligation, on Sept. 17th, Britain was happy to stretch that language to the breaking point, no matter how much they might not have liked Soviet actions. And why wouldn't they? There was definitely belief that Soviet-German cooperation wouldn't last and they would eventually turn on each other, and a declaration of war would jeopardize that, forcing the two into closer cooperation. Poland was doomed, and Britain knew she had no chance to actually save her from this initial invasion, so what would be gained by adding another belligerent to the war? When Sir William Seeds, the British Ambassador in Moscow, was asked his opinion, he responded ""I do not myself see what advantage war with the Soviet Union would be to us, though it would please me personally to declare it on Mr Molotov.""

So anyways, on the morning of the 17th, the Polish Ambassador visited the Foreign Office on what he really already knew was a futile mission, understanding that the British Government would (publically at least) state they had considered 'other European power' to be Italy, even though Poland, and perhaps any reasonable person, would have seen the USSR as the next biggest threat. The Cabinet met the next day to consider the matter, and prefered to do an ostrich act than play the lion, deciding simply to formally protest Soviet actions to register their ""horror and indignation"", and maintaining *""[complete confidence that on the conclusion of the war Poland would be restored](https://imgur.com/bGiRCnQ).""*

Poland of course protested, communicating to Lord Halifax, the Foreign Secretary, that ""the Polish Government reserve the right to invoke the obligation of its allies arising out of the treaties now in force"", but was succinctly rebuffed, which Halifax emphasising the British interpretation of the treaty, namely that they had no obligation to do anything other than consider the matter, meant *""we are free to take our own decision and to decide whether to declare war on the USSR or not.""*

So within only a day or two, the Soviet action was a *fait accompli* and if anything, the British government now went on a PR campaign to try and justify its lack of action. In October, after Poland had fallen, Lord Halifax addressed the House of Lords to note:

&gt;It is perhaps, as a matter of historical interest, worth recalling that the action of the Soviet Government has been to advance the boundary to what was substantially the boundary recommended at the time of the Versailles Conference by the noble Marquess who used to lead the House, Lord Curzon, who was then Foreign Secretary.

 Churchill, at the time First Lord of the Admiralty, characterized Soviet action as stemming from ""cold-self interest"" but nevertheless saw them as a future partner against Germany who shouldn't be unnecessarily antagonized for no benefit:

&gt;I believe Russia will always act as she thinks her own interests demand, and I cannot believe she would think her interests served by a German victory followed by a German domination of Europe.

Privately, he counseled Chamberlain that it was a 'favorable development' for British interests, and in a public declaration a few weeks after the Soviet incursion, he went even further to declare that their action ""was clearly necessary for the safety of Russia against the Nazi menace"". Pragmatic about Poland and the Soviet sphere since even before the war, when he was perceiving the potential for it, he was under no illusions about the importance of the USSR as an eventual partner in the war against Hitler, and wasn't eager to upset future events.

Additionally, although not a member of the government, it is also worth mentioning MP Lloyd George's editorial in the *Sunday Express* entitled ""What is Stalin Up To?"" published in late September, which essentially justified the Soviet movement and pushed their own explanation that it was intended as a humanitarian action to protect the people who lived in eastern Poland (In the words of the Soviets, *""The Soviet Government also cannot view with indifference the fact that kindred Ukrainian White Russian people, who live on Polish territory and who are at the mercy of fate, should be left defenceless""*). When Ambassador Raczyński attempted to have a refutation published in the *Times*, he was rebuffed and had to arrange for private printing of it.

The sum of it is that, to quote Doerr:

&gt;[F]rom the signing of the Nazi-Soviet Pact to the beginning of the Winter War [...] British policy-makers were driven by a profound ambivalence. On the one hand, a deep and abiding mistrust of the Soviets is easy to find. On the other, the British remained acutely aware of the grave situation they faced, and of the overriding need to retain a connection to Moscow. Such ambivalence can be found at the heart of all aspects of British-Soviet relations during this period.

It was only upon the invasion of Finland that British lawmakers began to find themselves unable to justify their inaction in the face of Soviet aggression. The onset of the Winter War was simply much harder to explain away with magic handwaving though, and in the weeks leading up to the Soviet invasion, the British were discussing how they would need to potentially react to such an eventuality. There was fear that if the Soviet did so, it would be prelude to a push further into Scandinavia, possibly threatening Norway. Some within the government went so far as to suggest that the UK should immediately declare war if such an attack came, although it was the minority view - ""ideological circles"" in Lord Halifax's words. A telegram from the British Ambassador to Finland on Oct. 21 to that effect was deemed impractical within the Foreign Office since ""the Cabinet presumably still take the line that we cannot afford to break with Russia and thus turn her into an ally of Germany"" as one commentator noted. This was backed up further by reports from the military that they were in no state to be able to lend military assistance. 

When the invasion came, obviously, war was not declared, despite significant outcry from the British public over the Soviet action. The same caution as before applied, but it was a lot harder to explain away what the Soviets were doing this time around. The British provided supplies, and there were some volunteers, but it wasn't until March that they finally felt they had no choice but to give into the public pressure and intervene. But even then, it was supposed to be a quite limited action, with the main intent to protect further incursion into Scandinavia, not just by the Soviets, but by Nazi Germany as well. The main thrust of the planned force was to occupy northern Norway and Sweden in order to prevent Swedish iron ore from falling into Nazi hands, and potential bombing of oil fields in the Caucasus, which at the time was being exported to Germany. The actual military assistance to the Finns would have been a single brigade placed in the far North, far from the key southern region where any actual impact would be felt. Obviously it all came to naught when Finland fell before it happened. This was just fine with the British as they had been incredibly uncomfortable with going through with the plan. It still was a bad blow to Soviet-Anglo relations for the next year though, and had at least some on Stalin's reluctance to trust British reports in early 1941 that Barbarossa was imminent.

In the end of course, the UK didn't necessarily make the wrong choice (for them. Poland and Finland definitely got screwed). I don't want to deal with counterfactuals, but the possibilities for how war would have progressed if the UK and France had entered open hostilities with the USSR certainly don't seem to *improve* the odds for the Allies. The travails of Poland through the war, and beyond, are really another topic, but suffice to say that the UK continued to ignore what was staring it in the face, and continue in its (public) belief that Poland would be restored, although in part we can say that it was a continuance of their ""we need to not piss off the USSR"" policy, and when it was clear they were mistaken, it was too late and there was nothing to be done anyways, leaving us with the sad irony of the war, that it was launched on the *casus belli* of maintaining Polish independence, and in the end, Poland would spend a half-century behind the Iron Curtain.

My wife is from Germany and I’ve had to deal with tax implications of these sorts of things quite a few times.  A lot of the overseas business income is eligible for tax deferral from the US at least, and there are also individual treaties with different countries to avoid some of the double taxation.  My children are dual US-German citizens and in trying to understand the implications of that I wondered how much use the dual citizenship could be given the tax situation.  It’s an interesting topic.  

But that’s why I asked - because I met my wife in University here and she moved back to Germany after to finish a masters degree over there.  We had to go through the process and I did have to demonstrate income during the process.

Overall I agree with your view - immigration is important for the US’s ongoing success because it will keep our population from shrinking and will mitigate the effects of an aging workforce.  Because of immigration we won’t have it as bad as Europe and Japan.  But we are also fortunate to have enough people wanting to come here that we can afford to be selective.  It’s preferable to have educated and skilled people over family immigration in a lot of cases.  My wife I believe can bring over her brother and parents though there is a long waiting period to do so.  I can see spouse and children, but brother and parents doesn’t make as much sense to me.

One thing though when you mention skills- So currently yes there is a shortage of skilled tradesmen so that’s great.  But there is also a shortage of unskilled labor.  I deal with that segment of the labor market as part of what I do.  It’s tight to the point where McDonalds is offering signing bonuses to all new employees (like 300 bucks paid partially on the first paycheck and partially a couple months later).  Unskilled Labor (including what some have called ‘jobs most americans don’t want to do’) is a need as well.  I agree we can be picky and skills are good but bringing in skilled people in too large of quantities could turn out causing an imbalance in the labor market.

The situation in 1940 was also a bit more complicated than the Germans going around a fortification or resurrecting the Schlieffen Plan. The Maginot Line in many ways performed as expected in 1940. The Germans were unable to break the line outside of a few areas, and even here these were costly attacks that achieved more in terms of propaganda than actual military results. The Line itself was not all that expensive in the bigger picture of French defense outlays and it did prevent a German thrust into central France. *Fall Gleb* managed to stumble onto a fracture point in Franco-Belgian defense and exploited it to the utmost. 

One of the popular complaints about French military policy, both in the immediate aftermath of 1940 and continuing in the postwar, was that Belgium's adherence to neutrality hampered the overall defense of the West against Germany. Alistair Horne in his famous *To Lose a Battle* described Belgian policy as akin to the nursery the rhyme Three Little Pigs in which Belgian intransigence ensured that ""in one stroke [France's] Maginot Line strategy lay in fragments."" Horne and other commentators would assert that the Maginot Line should have been extended in light of Belgium's insistence that it was a neutral, and as such could not have belligerents stationed on its territory. Such critiques though miss key elements both of Franco-Belgian grand strategy and ignore some of the problems inherent in extending the Maginot Line into this region.

While Belgium's public face was that of a neutral, its defense policy was definitely pro-French and geared towards cooperation with Paris. There were significant war plans and cooperation between the two countries' military establishment and both conceptualized many of the same problems. The critique that the Maginot Line should have extended through the frontier border misses the key fact that French strategic thought saw the Belgian frontier with Germany as the proxy extension of the Maginot. One 1932 French General Staff document noted that:

&gt;Belgium, by its geographic situation, constitutes the glacis of our northern region. Besides, it considers France as its natural ally. In case of German aggression, it will very probably request our support and its forces would cover, at the same time as Belgian territory, the meeting of the French armies destined to fight at their side. 

This conceptualization of Belgium as a glacis meant that the French general staff encouraged the Belgians to fortify the Albert Canal and Dyle River regions. While these fortifications were not on the scale of the Maginot defenses, they were not supposed to reach this level of fortification. Instead, they were intended to delay a German advance long enough for a link up of French and Belgian troops that would destroy the invading Germans in a methodical battle, hopefully along the flat plains around Gembloux. 

This strategic plan made French fortifications along the Belgian border somewhat superfluous. The whole idea of French planning itself was predicated on pushing Germany  to invade Belgium and then being delayed by geography and fortifications long enough for French forces to defeat them in a set-piece battle. The Maginot Line itself discouraged an alternate, direct thrust into France, leaving Belgium the only real option for German planners. There was some thought given by French and Belgian planners in the 1930s to fortifying Arlon region of the Ardennnes as a contingency plan, but not much came of it. Belgium was unwilling to cover the costs of fortifying this region, and even when the French offered to pay for it in 1934, the Belgian Foreign Minister rejected it. The official rationale was that this would have been too flagrant of a violation of Belgian neutrality, especially for a peripheral area. 

Although Belgium's rejection of the French offer seems foolish in hindsight, there were solid reasons for it at the time. Belgium's defense appropriations were already quite high and the Belgian government was having trouble paying for the fortifications on the German frontier. The Ardennes region itself was rather poorly suited for fortifications, being quite hilly and wet. This was one of the reasons too why the French did not seriously consider extending their own Maginot fortifications into this region. Costs of the existing Line were large and the overall sentiment in the French high command and government was such man-made fortifications would be superfluous in light of the region's unsuitability for mobile warfare.  Phillipe Petain was on record saying that the Ardennes was impenetrable and Gamelin described the Meuse River as ""Europe's best tank obstacle."" This however does not mean that the French military completely ruled out any attack through the Ardennes. The French high command estimated that because of the roads and geography, a German attack would likely take nine days to clear the forest and two weeks to reach the Meuse. If a German attack were to materialize in this sector, then the French high command believed they would have ample time to organize an efficient counterattack. In this scenario, the forest and the Ardennes's terrain were expected to act as fortifications that would delay a German advance like the Dyle fortifications. 

The German thrust in the region would prove this expectation to be woefully optimistic. *Fall Gelb*'s panzer and mechanized forces proceeded far quicker than most of the French high command expected, sixty hours to clear the Ardennes and a day to reach the Meuse. There were many voices within the French military that challenged this complacent attitude to the Ardennes in the 1930s. One of the local commanders, Colonel Bourguignon, conducted an exercise that demonstrated tanks could operate far easier within the Ardennes than French conventional wisdom dictated. In 1938, the commander of the French Second Army, General Andre Pretelat, conducted a map exercise that closely resembled Fall Gelb's thrust. Pretelat's estimates of a German attack's speed were only off by a mere three hours. Gamelin accused Pretelat of pessimism and the exercise was kept secret. 

It is also worth noting that some in the German high command shared the sentiments of Gamelin. Halder too thought the Meuse could only be reached in nine days at the earliest. Throughout *Fall Gelb* the German command was torn between two loose factions, the traditionalists and modernizers. The former feared that overextending panzers without proper infantry support would open up the German thrust to the dangers of an organized counterattack. The modernizers like Guderian favored a *Bewegungskrieg* (war of movement) and thought that mechanized forces and airpower would make up for the lack of infantry support. Lest we fall into the trap of at type of Calvinist historicism (modernizers are the elect and traditionalist the damned), remember that at various points *Fall Gelb* took extraordinary risks that could have been disastrous had the Allied forces acted more proactively. At the Battle of Sedan, the official *Bundeswehr* study of the campaign asserts that the local French commander had everything he needed to stop Guderian's thrust  *except* an order to do so.

The German's key advantages were both concentration of forces and operational flexibility. Although the Allies had numerical superiority and a rough technical parity in the air (there's a lot of hair splitting in many of the comments as to how superior one force was over the other), the larger and arguably more important point is that German airpower had effected a *numerical* superiority over the *schwerpunkt*. This made it much harder for the French to suddenly shift their airpower over the Ardennes. The Luftwaffe enjoyed a relative proximity to the main bases and were not operating at a distance. German concentration was not limited just in airpower, the I Flak Corps was in full force and prevented Allied airpower from exploiting the gaps in the Luftwaffe air umbrella. Furthermore, the Flak arm proved instrumental in its dual use against French fortifications and Allied tanks. Rommel famously stopped the Cambrai counterattack with his mobile flak units. As Fall Gelb developed, German airpower lost these advantages in concentration of force and proximity to German airfields, and that is when losses started to creep upwards. 

Overall, *Fall Gelb* was successful because it took a calculated risk that payed off handsomely. The Germans offensive played to their strengths, but they were aided considerably by the sluggard French high command. Fortifications in the Ardennes might have helped, or even stopped the German thrust, but that obscures the fact that the Ardennes thrust walked a knife's edge between success and catastrophe even without fortifications and facing reserve troops.

Well if you are telling the truth maybe you shouldn't have opened up a discussion by discounting Zionism and claiming that Zionism wouldn't have mattered.   You are not going to be given free rein to attack Jews as they exist because you wrap yourself in a blanket of condemnation for Hitler.  That's typical BDSer (though I know you are 2SSer) of starting off by condemning antisemitism before engaging in it.  

Hitler's fundamental problem with the Jews is that they are alien people subverting Germany from within and colonizing it and  who had no business in the land of Germans or for that matter all of Europe.  Essentially what you have been preaching with this settler colonialism idea.

&gt;  confidently fabricated a story about how Hitler didn't want to exterminate the Jews

He did not fabricate he exaggerated.  There is no question that the Nazis were divided on extermination vs. expulsion in the 1930s.  There early attempts at extermination were proving more difficult than anticipated. I go with the mainstream historians who believe the deciding blow was Eichmann's success in using the death camps to make Hungary Judenfrei and not the Grand Mufti.  But there should be no doubt about Netanyahu's basic point that had an easy and viable expulsion option been available Hitler would have gone for it.  

&gt; You should be outraged as well,

I'm not that outraged by an exaggeration like that when everyday I'm confronted with an organized mass movement engaging in far worse exaggerations and mixed with outright lies.    I'm much more outraged by modern proponents of Hitler running around in respectable circles. I'm much more outraged that Nazi era philosophy has become popular with the global left who think it is fine and respectable viewpoint as long as you replace Jude with Zionist.   

&gt;  The difference is that the Palestinians actually lived in Palestine before the First Aliyah

And that's nonsense.  Levant people lived in Palestine before the first Aliyah.  You are again preaching a nationalist myth based on continuity.   There were no Palestinians then.  There wouldn't be any Palestinians until the 1920s and nothing like a majority of the Levant people identifying as Palestinian until likely the 1980s.  

&gt;  If you simply argued that there was an imperative to create a Jewish state for purely pragmatic reasons, and that Palestine was the place with the most potential (because of its religious significance and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire), then we would actually have something to discuss.

What is there to discuss?  Ultimately what difference does it make why the Ottoman province of Palestine was chosen?  Why should it matter anymore than why the Arabs choose to come there and settle?   In 2018 Israel is a Jewish state?   Jews exist, they live.  Israel is their state.  The Arabic conquest had plenty of crimes.  If you want to make the argument of the legitimacy of collective punishment for ancestral evils then the Palestinians were being punished for the 1300 years of dhimmi status they subjected Jews to with the brief interruption.  Or heck maybe 1834 looting which was pre-Zionism so you can't blame the Jews for the Palestinian wickedness then.   You want to open the door to collective punishment for ancestral guilt that's a very wide door.

&gt;The most extensive collection of Hermetic writings is the Corpus Hermeticum, a set of about seventeen short Greek texts. Another collection as made by a scholar named John Stobaeus in the firth century A.D. Two other, longer texts stand alone. The first is the Asclepius, preserved in a Latin translation dating probably from the third century A.D. The second takes the form of a dialogue between Isis and Horus and has the unusual title of Kore Kosmou, which means ""daughter of the world.""

&gt;The reaction of the Christian establishment to these writings was ambivalent. It is true that they were never condemned and were even revered by many prominent ecclesiastics. An authoritative volume of the Hermetic books was printed in Ferrara in 1593, for example. It was edited by one Cardinal Patrizzi, who recommended that these works should replace Aristotle as the basis for Christian philosophy and should be diligently studied in schools and monasteries. The mind boggles at the turn Western culture might have taken had Hermetic teachings replaced Aristotelian theology of Thomas Aquinas as the normative doctrine of the Catholic Church!

&gt;Such, however, was not to be. One of the chief propagandists of Hermeticism, the brilliant friar Giordano Bruno, was burnt at the stake as a heretic in 1600, and although others continued with their enthusiasm for the fascinating teachings of the books of Hermes, the suspicions and doubts of the narrow-minded continued to dampen any general ardor.

&gt;By the seventeenth century, the Hermetic books had enjoyed intermittent popularity in Europe for some 150 years. The coming of the Protestant Reformation and the ensuing religious strife, however, stimulated a tendency toward rationalistic orthodoxy in all quarter. Another factor was the work of the scholar Isaac Casaubon, who used internal evidence in the texts to prove that they had been written, not by a contemporary of Moses, but early in the Christian era.7

&gt;By the eighteenth century, the Hermetic teachings were totally eclipsed, and the new scholarship, which prided itself on its opposition to everything it called ""superstition,"" took a dim view of this ancient fountainhead of mystical and occult lore.",True,False,False,,0,1536032513,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e5cwiu4,False,t3_9crxih,True,t3_9crxih,/r/occult/comments/9crxih/hermetic_christianity/e5cwiu4/,,1538642668,2,True,False,occult,t5_2qhmc,r/occult,public,,

Fiancee and I take a few vacations a year, NYC for a weekend or two, last year we drove from NY to LA and back. We took 15 days and made a good amount of stops, we also hit the beach too through the year.

I also use to take usually the day before and after most holidays off. What I do now we basically shut down from December 1 to April 1 so that's my travel time.

Traveling to Europe is a little harder for most Americans because of how much planning it takes and a lot of us view it as a really far away place. Here we can kind of just get in a car and drive where we want, but there it usually involved multiple flights and languages and currencies etc. We have a three week trip to Poland/Austria/Italy planned for next fall and we already started planning.

On that same note it can get a little pricey to travel to Europe, flights from NYC to Warsaw are about $900 round trip+hotels+transportation etc.

In all honestly I have friends that have 120+ hours of PTO saved up and they're well beyond their means to travel, but because America is so big a lot of people don't care to leave it. Deserts, mountains, beaches etc. Some people also just don't really care to travel.

Ummm... how exactly?

In your initial statement you say it´s muslims. In your edit you say you don´t know their religion. How does that constitute a win? How did I loose my bet when it´s still not clear if they are actually muslim or not?

​

Also, my point still stands. You read about a violent mob. You jump to the conclusion that it must be muslims. Thats ractist. Even when you are right it still stands that you jump to conclusions based on bias.

Thats like me saying: That guy is a priest? So he´s probably a pedophile.

Even if I were right and the guy was a pedophile it would still be a (don´t really know the proper word here so I´ll stick with racist) racist remark.

If you automatically say it must be muslims or immigrants when something bad happens then you´re a racist. ​

To clarify for you: Racism is when you think your own race is somewhat superior. You never said that, I know. However your reasoning is that there is something bad that happened and that could not have been done by the whites in the area. You never said that either, I know! You mentally skip that step. It OBVIOUSLY (good chance) was muslims or immigrants. Why? Because white people don´t attack female paramedics?

And once again, even if you were right this would not absolve you from being a racist. You can be a racist and right.

I can say that every American is a incesting, fat, gunslinging hillbilly with no teeth living in a trailer. That would be pretty racist, don´t you agree. And I can travel to the US and find just these people there. And then I would tell you: Told you so! These guys are incesting, fat, gunslinging hillbilly with no teeth living in a trailer. So I´m not a racist, right?

NO! It´s still shitty racism there. You do the same thing. Female paramedic attacked. Must be muslim.

&gt; - The entries of non-Koreans increased by 12.5%. In particular, the entries of non-Koreans aged 30 ~ 39 showed the highest increase (23.7%).
&gt; - The entries from China, Thailand and Vietnam occupied 61.0% of the total non-Korean entries.

Automation may slow this in the long term, but we are a long way from that happening.

No es misión del sistema capitalista fomentar el pensamiento crítico,hacer que la gente piense,sino estupidizarla en una sociedad consumista y en la Argentina ello se lleva acabo exitosamente para la clase dominante oligárquico-financista.

Los argentinos son emotivos, temperamentales por naturaleza,vaya a saber si en buena medida por su herencia latina como descendientes de italianos y españoles.

En el siglo pasado y sobre todo entre los años 30 a 40, la Argentina era un país con una economía primaria (agropecuaria) y dependiente del mercado inglés, gobernado por los hijos de una oligarquía vacuna (la llamada “década infame” ) que vivía de la renta de la tierra y de la explotación de peonadas (hombres y mujeres) en sus enormes estancias.

El cierre de abastecimientos industriales por causa de la guerra, promovió una incipiente industrialización(sustitución de importaciones).

Sobre la base de enormes ganancias obtenidas durante el conflicto por proveer de alimentos a los países involucrados, el peronismo triunfante intensificó el desarrollo de esa industrialización(muchas veces basada en subvenciones)a la que acompañó la urbanización y proletarización de millones de ex trabajadores del campo (o simplemente desocupados).

(Cualquier semejanza con la España de los 60 es pura coincidencia )

De la misma manera que el estado de bienestar europeo fué producto de enormes ganancias obtenidas de la explotación sobre todos de Africa y demás colonias, países semicoloniales y dependientes, el enorme colchón de divisas y la necesidad de alimentar el funcionamiento de las fábricas, permitió a los argentinos disfrutar de su temporal estado de bienestar.

Duró tres o cuatro años y finalizó cuando-terminada la guerra- la producción de los grandes centros industriales mundiales volvió a abastecer los mercados a precios inferiores a los de la producción nacional incluso subsidiada.

Perón cayó en 1955 en medio de una crisis que habia comenzado algunos años antes, y de la disputa por el predominio mundial entre el declinante imperio británicos y el pujante triunfador de la guerra:los EEUU.

Argentina siempre había sido una rutilante estrella en la constelación del firmamento inglés.

Entre los años 1955 (derrota de Perón) y el gobierno de Néstor Kirchner ,la Argentina ha vivido cincuenta años entre golpes militares, con escasos períodos de estabilidad económico-social.

Frondizi; Illia; Perón; Isabel su mujer; Alfonsín; Menem; Néstor Kirchner y Cristina Fernández (seis o siete en 50 años) han sido los presidentes civiles entre unos cuantos militares y algún civil en períodos que raramente superaron el año.

Los años en que gobernaron los militares fueron de represión, pero no solamente porque el pueblo luchaba por restablecer la democracia, sino por las duras condiciones en que vivían las clases populares.

Y en los años que gobernaron los civiles, esas mismas clases no vieron mejorar sus niveles de vida y trabajo sino que fueron y se sintieron traicionadas en sus expectativas, por los políticos a quienes habian votado con entusiasmo y esperanza.

Es que siempre las decepciones son directamente proporcionales a las ilusiones ;y las ilusiones de este pueblo temperamental siempre fueron grandes.

Menem es el caso más típico de esta grave desilusión.

Este hombre (peronista y torturado por la dictadura) privatizó todo lo que tuvo a mano.

Entre estas empresas nada menos que YPF(petróleo);Gas del Estado; Aerolíneas Argentinas; etc. , y hasta el Correo Argentino que cayó en manos de los Macri.

Además estableció lo que llamó “relaciones carnales” con los EEUU haciendo que el peso equivaliera al dólar ,abriendo el mercado argentino a las multinacionales (libre importación frente a una industria débil) , subordinando la economía argentina a la norteamericana con el resultado conocido:desastre total y fin en el “corralito”.

El recuerdo de la época peronista de las vacas gordas ha quedado fijado en la mente de los argentinos más allá de la generación que la vivió y explica-en buena medida- el éxito de los gobiernos de los Kirchner ,peronistas de nuevo cuño.

Durante sus mandatos se vivió una época en en la que fueron muy altos los precios de los productos que el país exportaba.

También en esta época la burguesía argentina hizo buenas ganancias, lo que permitió recuperar beneficios sociales desaparecidos(“Tiburón que se baña, salpica” dicen los cubanos).

Ninguno de los gobiernos argentinos tocó las bases del poder de la clase dominante.

Ni se hizo una reforma agraria;ni se nacionalizó el comercio exterior y la banca extranjera siguió siendo la dueña del mercado.

La misma villa miseria que hace 50 años se extendía a lo largo de vías ferroviarias que conducen a estación Retiro,no solamente sigue allí,sino que ha adquirido- casi- categoría de ciudad, alargándose sobre la Gral Paz y ostentando orgullosamente la denominación de ""Villa 31"",con una población de 40.000 habitantes.

Y es una de las siete en Buenos Aires capital.

               --------------------------------------

La esperanza es connatural a la raza humana.

No se puede vivir sin ella, aunque penda de un delicado hilo.

Esperanza en una satisfactoria vida ultraterrena,o en la mejoría de las actuales condiciones en ésta..

Y la esperanza en una vida mejor para sí, para la familia y para la sociedad es tanto más fuerte cuanto peor se vive.

Por algo proliferan las iglesias y las sectas en donde se va a rezar para compensar en el más allá la miseria de este mundo, y también para que la deidad - en cuanto le sea posible- nos conceda la gracia de mejorar nuestra existencia en este valle de lágrimas .

Las peregrinaciones en Argentina a la iglesia de la Virgen del Pilar, a las de San Cayetano y San José Obrero(1º. de mayo)son multitudinarias y con el mismo fervor los apasionados argentinos se han entregado a los modernos apóstoles políticos cuyas efigies queman al sentirse defraudados, traicionados.

In my experiences most people had a problem with eastern euros coming over and pushing down wages, taking jobs at lower rates of pay. For instance, and this is only anecdotal, Im very good friends with a plasterer (used to work in building myself many years ago), his wages went from £150 a day down to £80 a day, sheet metal workers seeing their wages drop from £20 an hour to £8 an hour, etc etc, all because of the influx of eastern euro tradesman. People had an issue with that...and if it had affected you, im sure you would have had an issue too if you had been to college for 3 years then seen your wage drop to minimum wage.

I don't care what Remainers, or anyone else, *think we should do* in light of the referendum result. That is not what I am discussing.

The only reason that the referendum result is relevant in the first place is because it notionally measures the preferences of the electorate. My analysis is an attempt to discover a finer-grained understanding of those preferences.

If further analysis uncovers that there is more support for keeping FoM than removing it, then that preference is no less real than the preference uncovered by the referendum that there is more support for leaving the EU than remaining within it.

Suppose, in addition to the question of leaving the EU, the referendum had also asked if we should end or retain FoM (with ending FoM and remaining in EU are incompatible options). The result of the first question would, presumably, be the same 52/48 Leave majority. If my preference analysis is correct^(1), then the second question would return a narrow win to retain FoM. Both are equally valid statements of the democratic will of the people.

The only difference between that hypothetical scenario and reality is that the second question was not asked. But that doesn't change what people's preferences are, and those preferences are what ""The Will Of The People"" actually means. If our goal was *truly* to enact a result which respects the will of the people, then respecting the will to retain of FoM should be on equal footing with the will to leave the EU.

Obviously that's not going to be the case because the FoM preference is buried in statistics rather than being a headline result, but it is intellectually dishonest to argue that because the question was not asked, the preference ceases to exist.
