&gt; # Se estrena ‘Carmen y Lola’, la película sobre lesbianas gitanas que fue retirada de una muestra de cine – Inpelis
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt; **‘Carmen y Lola’** fue una de las películas encargadas de representar a España en la Quincena de realizadores de la última edición del Festival Internacional de Cine de **Cannes** . También fue elegida por la **Academia del Cine Europeo**, junto a _Handía_, para representar a nuestro país. Sin embargo, la película dirigida por la bilbaína **Arantxa Echevarría** ha cosechado fama entre el público no tanto por romper un **tabú** como es el amor entre dos mujeres homosexuales de etnia gitana, sino por la **polémica** que ha acarreado desde el inicio del proyecto.
&gt; 
&gt; Fue el pasado mes de junio cuando **colectivos feministas gitanos** llamaron al boicot a la proyección de la película en la XXXII Muestra de Cine y Mujeres de Pamplona, que realiza la **Fundación IPES** de la capital navarra cada año y que está financiada por el Ayuntamiento y el Gobierno autonómico. Se trataba de la primera proyección de la película en España. No obstante, las **presiones** recibidas por la Asociación Gitanas Feministas por la Diversidad terminaron por causar la **retirada del filme** de la programación.
&gt; 
&gt; La directora de la película, Arantxa Echevarría, ya había denunciado en anteriores ocasiones el boicot que se estaba llevando a cabo para impedir la emisión de la película tras haber soportado “**escupitajos, insultos y recriminaciones** por la calle y por las redes”. Según recoge [El Correo](https://www.elcorreo.com/culturas/cine/boicot-gitanas-feministas-20180606152729-nt_amp.html), tras las quejas del colectivo feminista de gitanas, **la directora “se negó” a participar en la charla** que tendría lugar con motivo de la muestra.
&gt; 
&gt; En un comunicado, la realizadora explicó que “el IPES llamó a la asociación de gitanas explicándoles que yo no quería entrar en el debate y éstas le contestaron que **irían al cine, que movilizarían a todo el mundo con pancartas**, con manifestaciones en mi contra y de la película. El IPES, por **miedo a las represalias**, me comentó que lo mejor era quitar la película de la programación. **Me pareció lo más correcto** tal y como estaba desarrollándose toda esta montaña de sinsentidos”.
&gt; 
&gt; [Image](https://e00-elmundo.uecdn.es/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2018/08/31/15357097619111.png)
&gt; 
&gt; La propia Fundación publicó su propio comunicando explicando que “el **desencuentro**, ya existente antes de la Muestra entre la directora que acompaña la promoción de la película y el colectivo de gitanas feministas, imposibilitaba la realización de esta sesión”.
&gt; 
&gt; La película, que finalmente fue proyectada durante las celebraciones del **Orgullo Gay de Bilbao** a finales del pasado mes de junio, se estrenará e los cines españoles el próximo **7 de septiembre**. Varios colectivos gitanos han criticado la película por considerar que **perpetúa los estereotipos** de esta etnia: “Ser gitana y lesbiana es difícil en un **mundo payocentrista y heteronormativo**, no solo en la comunidad gitana como pretende mostrar la película”, asegura en un comunicado la asociación Gitanas Feministas. Para **Carmen Fernández**, vicepresidenta de la asociación, las críticas no son contra la película, que **reconocen no haber visto**, sino contra las declaraciones “de **feminismo paternalista**” de la directora.
&gt; 
&gt; Críticas a parte, la película ha cosechado muy buenos comentarios en el extranjero por atreverse a tratar un tema “complicado” que no se había abordado antes. Serán los espectadores los que tengan la última palabra.
&gt; 
&gt;  Arantxa Echevarría explicó en su día la dificultad que tuvo a la hora de encontrar a las dos protagonistas de la película. Ninguna de las candidatas quería ocupar el papel principal hasta que aparecieron **Zaira Romero** y **Rosy Rodríguez**, dos mujeres que, a pesar de ser heterosexuales, se presentaron al casting con la idea de encarnar a Carmen y Lola, una estudiante de instituto y una empleada de mercado.
&gt; 
&gt; La película narra la historia entre dos adolescentes gitanas que se enamoran y luchan por llevar a cabo sus metas ante el rechazo y la discriminación de su comunidad y su propia familia.

But I also think that part of your frustration stems from the inadequate help you are receiving from their customer service. I mean, if a laptop, not even a year old, is being serviced multiple times, you'd think Dell would accept the product is quite defective.

&amp;#x200B;

Having said that, I think remaining calm and polite to customer service would help you a lot. Don't lose your temper with them or use rude words- nothing is guaranteed to get you less help than being rude to the people trying to help you. (Not saying that you're rude, of course, but you just have to go over to r/talesfromtechsupport to know that no one is keen to help a rude customer, and some people will go out of their way to help a nice one.) 

&amp;#x200B;

The relevant laws may depend on your particular jurisdiction- are you in the UK? The US? Europe? There are normally laws about consumer protection that regulate what happens if you receive a defective product. These laws are meant to protect consumers, seeing as there is a (usually) a power imbalance between a big producer and a small consumer. Finding the relevant clause which explains what happens if you receive a defective product may help.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I would continue to communicate with them. If they really refuse to help and the laptop continues to be defective, you may obtain results by quoting whatever piece of consumer legislation is in your favour - for example, some defective products may require replacement if repairs can't fix it. Remember to ask nicely! Companies sometimes back down when legislation is quoted at them, but be prepared for them to not budge either- they know it is unlikely that you will actually pursue them, it would cost you too much.

&amp;#x200B;

Universities normally have a legal clinic where members of the public can go to get free legal advice given by supervised law students, so if you're not sure where to start on the legislation that may be your best bet.

In the U.S., many fliers use budget airlines for work week commuting, not just weekend trips. So again, they will skip the excessive baggage if they're going to have to pay extra to bring extra on the plane.

As background, Russia has long been a nation culturally divided by Europe and Asia, and unhappy in either.  When riding on the steppes, Russians dream of Paris; and when in Paris, they long for the vast open spaces of Asia.  

But this division is far reaching, because Europeans and Asians have an entirely different view of life.  The former hold individuality as the greatest good; the latter rank it far behind family, village, nation and other loyalties.

As foreigners have noted:  when a Russian acts like a European, he is lying; but when he acts like an Asian, you can believe what he says.

A great introduction to this alien character is found in the brilliant movies of Sergei Eisenstein, Ivan the Terrible, Part I (1944), and Part II (1958).  Then, by a different director, Peter the First (1937), and Conquest of Peter the Great (1938).

Them refusing to compensate us for their illegally extracted tariffs after multiple trade board rulings demanding they do so should have been the impetus for us to start divesting ourselves from them.  Becoming so integrated with the American economy was easy.  We should have taken the hard path, and done more to develop trade partnerships in Europe and Asia (human rights permitting).  

It's the same calculus now.  Trump isn't that much worse than previous administrations, he's not some insane aberration, he's the obvious next step in America's political trajectory.

The US had never set a foot in any islands except Iwojima, although remaining soldiers and civilians had surrendered on September 3rd on  USS Dunlap. I'm not sure if civilians were at the sight of American officers at the time of the signing. By this signing, the Ogawasara Islands had became an occupied territory of the US.

The evacuated civilians had sheltered and worked around Yokohama, and one of the village leader,  Fred Savory, had contacted U. Alexis Johnson, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State who was in Tokyo at the time, and negotiated the return of the residents and GHQ had only approved for families of American-European Origin to go back. When they had returned, they found only two houses stood still so they had to live with American troops.

I worked at the Ataturk airport for two years as a profiler. I can tell you, the airport is ok, the issue is -as you almost said- with passengers. People do with what they have. And don’t forget, Ataturk airport is one of the busiest airports in the world. And they’re really doing so so well relatively to the number of people passing by this connection point.

As someone who travelled a lot, in many countries, I can tell you it’s a pretty decent airport. Even compared to European airports. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been in Paris CDG or London and nobody would come and inform us in moments of delay or whatever. In IST, everybody is doing their best (except girls sticked to their iPhones, I know) to ensure passengers are informed and the work is done. I know this form personal experience, people in Turkey care about travelers, if not all of them, most of them do.

I like both classes and most of the salty players are usually warriors and clerics because Trion is bad at balancing. I would suggest not investing a single dime in any of Trion games because the company is just scavenging for money to finance other things rather than invest it back into their games. The plan for them is to rehash content that has been rehashed already. It is quite lame to be honest. They didn't put much work into this expansion like NT or SL. It was built in a way to just milk players with as little content as possible.

In fact the end game is so bad I would suggest you just do the story line quest and don't even raid or do dungeons. They are terrible.. I would definitely wait for some popular upcoming MMO to sub to. Even if it may be bad at least you know the devs are putting effort to fix it.  Kickstarter games usually have more success these days as its very heavily player driven unlike Rift where they basically ignored their players for nearly 2 years and expected it to still make them money.

​

Prime was a another flop because it kind of impacted live terribly. It made people quit live and it was a no brainer for players to realize what would happen when they released prime.  For instance, my guild was 30-40 players online and we had to rebuild from losing  nearly 60 players after Trion forced pay to win or play for the last expansion. We managed to rebuild our guild and have 3 groups raiding BoS successfully then they release prime and now their is only like 2 players online..we don't raid much in our guild and I usually just go to another guild or try to pug BoS.  The impact was horrible.

​

What did players ask for! They wanted EU/NA players to play together so that they had more players to play with because it was getting depressing trying to fill missing spots.  Making prime only made this problem exponentially worse. That is why now both prime and live are terrible condition.

Are you familiar with Germany? Because this seems like a very US-centric argument generalized to Europe. Well, sometimes that works and this time it doesn't.

And while I would agree that it's a problem if the seems like the government is just inviting in lots of refugees that then come and thieve and steal and rape and murder (our culture?) my issue is with the perception.

Because it's an overreaction, based on what reality actually looks like. But people believing that still has negative consequences, no matter how wrong they estimate the facts. So if anything what we need is just for everyone to calm the fuck down and look at what's actually going on, not what could perceivably be going on if our worsts fear and nightmares were true.

And what we'd find is that yea, some shit is actually not going great. But by and large we're actually, really, seriously doing okay.

same could be said with all other anime mmorpg titles because they're all under garbage companies (this applies to every single game i will be listing btw)

also there is no doubt every anime mmorpgs are very inactive in both early/late game (it hurts to tell you this because all of the companies treat the english community like garbage, most of the korean devs treat their own country like garbage but aren't brave enough to sell founder packs to koreans LOL)

**Mabinogi** is one of my favorate anime mmorpgs with so much freedom and a large world to explore, i always played in alexina because it was the most popular server. this game has the most depth and content out of all anime mmorpgs. it used to be called the 3d runescape.

**Soul Worker** is a 3d mmorpg with wasd controls and click to attack that everyone should try just for the graphics people suggest the burning soulworker private server. gameforge hosts this so i'm in the same boat as others.

**Closers** is also a decent anime side scroller that also has a private server code: closers which is superior imo, i hate enmasse ever since they ruined tera. the story is about people with super power protecting the modern city from a alien invasion.

**Tree of Savior** is ran by the imcgames, they developed granado espada, anyways this is a anime like mmo with a european setting. it is similar to ragnarok but uses 3d models and has far more quests (new players may think it's a quest grinder) but you can grind in instance dungeons starting from lv.50 or grind in fields. after lv.200 you can enter challenge mode and grind wave of monsters with a party to level even quicker. there are end game raids and guild wars. - you can use keyboard mode/ mouse mode / controller for this game and it has alot of class build variety compared to the usual mmos. - downside about the game is that their lack of support / communication keeps discouraging players to quit so the playerbase is ever dropping but it's no doubt one of the prettiest games to play.

honestly if you want active end game you either give up on the anime and just play guild wars 2 / warframe / path of exile or suffer :( good luck!

 The basic question of proprietorship and its legitimation is written small when
students anywhere in the world ask aloud to whom the university belongs. On a global scale, men in all
parts of the world are being compelled by the multiplying hints of impending doom to ask: to whom does
the world belong? It is a mark of our heritage that this question is framed in a context of ownership; but the
very asking of the question can perhaps lead men out beyond proprietary abuse towards a shared
responsibility for recuperation, maintenance and ecologically balanced development of the limited
resources available to us on this planet. And chief of all these resources, as even economists are being
challenged to take seriously, are human beings.""
As Erich Fromm recently put it, a ""revolution of hope"" is possible only in and through a humanization
of technology."" But neither past nor present policies with regard to ""modernization"" lend much support to
the notion that a humanization of technology might come about by way of some sort of historical
inevitability. If it is to come at all, it will somehow be the result of a deliberate and concerted effort on the
part of all who have recognized other alternatives as intolerable and have somehow translated this
recognition into political-or, perhaps better, supra-political-power. It is indeed conceivable that present-day
socio-political relations can be transformed
192 Edmund F. Byrne
into what Amitai Etzioni calls ""the active society."" But, as this socio-political analyst intimates, the
structure within which each power group must operate is rapidly becoming international and to some
extent already global in scope. Accordingly, so long as the efforts of social outcasts in South Africa to
control their own destiny are not effectively combined with those of others in the same region or continent,
if not beyond, the supranational power elite who contend primarily only among themselves for control of
knowledge, communications and technology will continue to confuse the weakness of the politically
disorganized as a mandate to continue ruling as in the past.""
It would seem, then, that the very survival-to say nothing of the prosperity-of the great majority of
human beings on this planet is to a great extent a function of utility as defined by the powerful few."" But as
machines continue to substitute for and supersede not only the physical but even the intellectual labor of
human beings, the latter will, in terms of work, be of no further use save to provide ""services"" for one
another."" At this point, their continued existence may be tolerated only so long as they are willing to stay
out of the way and not try to gain what some call ""a piece of the action."" ""Short-run"" unemployment is still
so identified in developed societies with ""long-run"" economic growth that its presumably temporary
victims are afforded at least minimal compensation. But extended unemployment of the kind that is often
the lot of people in the ""developing"" societies leads inevitably to widespread hunger and despair, and the
latter tend to find expression in rebellion. But a despair born of hunger (spiritual as well as physical) and
reared on oppression may seek its maturity in violence.""
The long-range consequences of this increasingly dangerous world situation might well be a century
not of genocide as such but of paupercide: the indirect elimination of the non-productive and the direct
elimination of the counter-productive in many if not all parts of the world. If this be a kind of paranoia,
then let it be said in defense of paranoia that it is supported by a large body of substantive data whose
implications become clearer with each passing decade. In spite of such ultimately insignificant
interferences as those brought about by kidnapping, airplane hijacking, rooftop sniping or the bombing of
buildings, the opposition of outsiders against insiders seems inherently futile; and, if pursued in any given
area to the point of major confrontation, could well lead to reprisals so effective

and encompassing as to put the ovens of Auschwitz back into the Middle Ages of Population Control.""
For, while one-half of the world's population is centered in East, South and Southeast Asia and another
one-fifteenth each inhabit Latin America and Africa, control over and development of the world's
resources is centered predominantly in North America, Europe and the USSR."" Moreover, the power-gap
here suggested is widening steadily rather than narrowing.""
As is well known, living conditions in the United States and in India were closer together 150 years ago
than they are now, partly because the latter country's economic growth has been absorbed by its increasing
population. What is yet more sobering, however, is that India is not likely to ""catch up."" Given its present
per capita annual income ($50 as compared with $2,000 in the U.S.A. in 1960), if both were to double over
a decade or so, India's per capita income would then be $100, that of the United States, $4,000. In the
meantime, the United States produces enough food to provide each of its inhabitants with 3,200 calories
per day, twice that of India, which however has more than twice as many people and less than half as much
land, not to mention its incomparably fewer roads, automobiles, and other modern conveniences. To
mention just a few key indicators of technological development, in the United States per capita
consumption of energy in 1959 was almost 8,000 kilograms of coal equivalent, in India it was 150
kilograms; in the United States, 89 million long tons of steel were produced in 1960 (27 percent of the
world total for that year), and 3'73 million metric tons of oil were produced in 1963 (29 percent of the
world total for that year), whereas in India production of both of these sources of energy was then and still
is negligible."" As these sample figures indicate, the United States and India are almost literally worlds
apart; yet it is unlikely that the former will prove very helpful in the latter's efforts towards economic
development, since its economic policies respond primarily if not exclusively to internal demands for
protection against competitive imports. 12
Yet another aspect of the growing international power-gap is the tendency of highly developed
countries to exploit the mineral resources of under-developed nations not yet in a position to take
advantage of such resources themselves. A good example is that of oil. The currently prominent area of
northern Africa called ""the Middle East"" would be a case in point, as would be the now",True,False,False,,0,1535774174,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e5729cm,False,t3_9bzxhz,True,t3_9bzxhz,/r/Paupericide/comments/9bzxhz/a_decent_definition/e5729cm/,,1538544450,1,True,False,Paupericide,t5_nykhu,r/Paupericide,public,,

[So do we.](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/milk-surplus-forcing-canadas-dairy-industry-to-dump-supply/article25030753/) Not an argument. 

&gt;Our system keeps milk prices slightly higher then US due to the way its managed and sold. 

Yeah, that's why I don't like it. And by the way, our milk prices are [hugely dependent on the province](https://bc.ctvnews.ca/are-canada-s-milk-prices-fair-to-consumers-1.3983366). In some, it's a bit over a dollar a liter. In some, it's two bucks. that's stupid, especially since it's actually cheaper in higher-income provinces which means the poorer provinces pay a lot more in relative terms. And you know why that is? Our stupid supply management system.

&gt;Dairy supply management system keeps milk local to the area it's sold and basically cuts out US producers unless they are willing to change the way they make product.

What if I don't want local milk because it sucks? Because Ontario milk is shit in comparison to the milk I had in Europe. I want to buy milk from Alberta or Quebec or something from the States like Wisconsin, because that should be my choices as a consumer. And hey, maybe they make better quality milk! Because Polish milk tastes amazing and so does French milk compared to shitty Ontario milk.

&gt;The US wants the ability to dump shit product at a lower price into the country.

Lower prices are good for the consumers. If we can allow the Americans access to our market by creating either a universal North American standard for milk production or forcing them to abide by our standards - and still offer us milk at the same price or lower than local suppliers, I don't have a problem with it. People who like local milk will buy local milk. Others who want cheap milk will buy cheap milk. 

&gt;Instead of people fighting to fix our own system they want to allow another country to destroy local dairy producers by undercutting them in the Canadian market.

Because there won't be any attempt to fix our current system because it works perfectly for the milk and farm lobbies which provide political support to our parties. Why would they want to change it? And why would the politicians risk changing the system if it costs them votes and monetary support? 

The current supply management status quo makes it so that there is no incentive to better their products or to expand into new markets if their market share and profits are guaranteed by the government. They won't change unless there's an existential threat to their market practices and profits - and that will only happen if the Americans get into the fray.

If you are likely to have more than a passing interest, get the best model you can afford. A good microscope is a pleasure to use and will last you many years. It will also have a good resale value so you can use it for years, sell it and it will have cost you very little.

I would not recommend the really cheap microscopes (anything under around £300 - 400) as they are rubbish.

Aim to spend around £500 or more.

You can buy used brand models on ebay with a bit of patience. Get a complete working model with objectives in good condition as buying individual spares can be expensive.

If you are in Europe and want to buy new, I can recommend this model that I reviewed a few years ago (full disclosure: this is my website).  https://micro-science.co.uk/product/iscope-microscope-led-trino/ It has a 10 year warranty too.

I own lots of microscopes (some of them very expensive) and for daily use, this one really is good enough.

yes there have been votes for regional parliaments in england people voted against it. 

&gt;I could say that lack of representation in England has caused Brexit. But that is a wild claim. Try to convince me, though, that it is not true.


I would agree though it was about EU representation, brexit was a result of the UK experiencing the highest levels of immigration in its history, then the EU making clear only weeks before the vote that it would never make any kind of compromise of concession on free-movement such as a yearly cap on numbers so long as the UK was a member. People in the UK already felt the EU doesn't represent them and only cared about its own agenda of creating an EU super state, this hammed that point home at the worse possible time. 

Polling seems to support that given the focus of the UK public was on immigration and the UK inability to change or override EU laws. And support for leave jumped after the EU sent Cameron packing after his attempted renegotiation. 

Where as polls also showed if the EU had made a significant compromise on freedom of movement there would have been landslide support for remain. (I saw some polls showing 70% would vote for remain if the reforms Cameron initially wanted were secured)

All those groups of people you are labeling with your prejudices. The actual topic here. Please pay attention.

Which you brought up after I told you that it is a practice that is **not** common here. You disregarded that and started to come up with some story from London. You still disregard it and now being faced with your strategy you try to shift the discussion to either me or some kind of ""radical Islam"" thing that seems to be a virus that has to apply in the same way everywhere which would justify your failed ""observation"" regarding those Turk and Arab females. 

&gt; You are awful at arguing. 

Let's remember, you've started out with the usual ""I'm not a racist, I have a black friend""-argument to negate what OP said regarding racism in Germany to swiftly switch over to some biased observation of yours that those arabs and turks won't let their daughters play with the whites and because of that whites should not be called racist. 

That pitiful back paddling you've started to practice since then and shifting the blame and topic from that to me or to other countries is now what you consider arguing?

**Shay Given**


The experienced and professional Shay Given was signed from Newcastle United in 2009 to be City’s first choice goalkeeper by Mark Hughes. However, Mancini eventually replaced him with Joe Hart in 2011 and he was firmly our second choice by the time of the Cup final. Unhappy with his lack of playing time, Given pushed for a move to Aston Villa to become first choice after this season, but he only stayed as their first choice for a solitary season.


After a reasonably successful loan spell at Middlesbrough, Given joined Stoke City as a back-up for Jack Butland for the last couple of years of his playing career. About a year after being released by Stoke, Given announced his retirement from professional football earlier this year and is currently Derby County’s goalkeeping coach.


**Pablo Zabaleta**


The humble right-back joined City in 2008 as a replacement for Vedran Corluka and became the final signing before the Sheikh Mansour takeover. Zaba started as a right-back with Richards and Dunne as the CBs, but by this time, Micah had been played by Mancini as a right-back, over-taking him. However, showing the hard work and determination that made him such a fan favourite, Zabaleta would ultimately claim the right-back spot as his own, following the 2011/12 title winning season and became the captain in Vincent Kompany’s absence.


Unfortunately, though he was a vital part of the team from 2012-2015, in 2015/16, injuries started to limit his playtime, leading to more Bacary Sagna having to fill in. After Pep Guardiola’s first full season, Zaba left in the great full-back exodus, following an emotional send-off. He’s since had a great first season for West Ham United, establishing himself as their first choice right-back and is still playing football at a high level.


**Dedryck Boyata**


The Belgian international was a part of our youth set-up, being a part of the 2008 team that won the FA Youth Cup. After being promoted to the first team squad the following year, Mancini started him in a couple of cup matches and he got a few minutes the following season, notably getting sent off against Arsenal. He was on his way out by the time of the cup final, leaving for Bolton and then Twente on loan, though he got a couple of appearances in Pellegrini’s first two seasons.


In 2015, he was sold to Celtic, where he was established as a first team player. Over three seasons at Celtic, he established himself as one of their starting centre-backs and an important player. Unfortunately, he seems to have demanded a move away in this past season, which has understandably led to anger amongst Celtic fans. In the end, Boyata has stayed at the club, but likely has work to do to get back on the good side of the fans.


**James Milner**


Milner was another one of Roberto Mancini’s 2010 summer signings that promised much. He started off the club well and scored an equaliser early on in City’s cup run, during an exciting 2-2 draw with Leicester City. Following this season, he became a well-valued player for Mancini, being an important part of the demolition of Man United at Old Trafford and later Pellegrini viewed him as a valuable player, starting Milner on the wing frequently for much of his last two seasons at the club.


Milner left for Liverpool in the summer of 2015 and unfortunately, since then, he hasn’t exactly enamoured himself with City fans, criticising being played as a winger and celebrating after scoring against us. Still, he’s excelled in multiple positions for Liverpool and established himself as one of Klopp’s most reliable players since the German came in. Milner was an important part of Liverpool’s Champion’s League campaign last year and is still playing at a very high level, scoring as recently as two weeks ago.


**Adam Johnson**


Known for reasons… outside of football, Adam Johnson was a promising youth player for Middlesbrough, bought by Manchester City in the 2010 January transfer window. Johnson was actually an extremely prominent player for City in his first few years at City, being involved in over 30 league games. In this final, he even came on for Gareth Barry.


After being involved pretty significantly in the title winning season, he was sold to Sunderland in 2012 and he was a prominent player there for several seasons. Unfortunately, he famously was convicted for grooming and sleeping with an underage girl and he’s currently in prison for this. Not much more to say, except he’s an irresponsible idiot.


**Patrick Vieira**


Arsenal midfield legend Patrick Vieira’s career was winding down by the time he played the last few seconds of this cup final, but he still was able to have some impact in midfield for a couple of seasons for City. This match was his last appearance as a professional footballer, before retirement at the end of the season. Viera stayed involved with Manchester City and was appointed as City’s Football Development Executive. Perhaps to pursue a career in management, he was appointed reserve team manager in 2013.


With strong connections to the CFG (City Financial Group), Vieira was appointed as manager of New York City FC and proved to be a strong and capable manager. He was able to improve NYCFC from 17th place when he came in to 4th by the end of the season and 2nd by the end of the next season. During the summer, he returned to Europe and was appointed by OGC Nice, ahead of the 2018/19 season.


**Edin Džeko**


Edin Džeko was signed by Mancini in the January transfer window where he was broadly used as a back-up striker (though still made a fair amount of starts). He didn’t come on for this cup final, but he did go on to have a pretty prolific time at Eastlands, being one of City’s most dangerous players in the first half of the 2011/12 title campaign and being a valued player of both Mancini and Pellegrini.


Unfortunately, though he was an immensely talented striker, he always struggled to get consistent minutes, playing second fiddle to Sergio Aguero during his time here. After a pretty lacklustre 2014/15 season, exacerbated by a calf injury, Džeko left for Roma in the summer. Džeko has done very well since arriving in Italy, scoring 45 goals across three seasons and being a vital part of the Champion’s League Semi-final spot last year.

Yes immigrants increase supply as well as demand.  
Also the figures aren't really that high. Net EU migration for 2017 dropped to 100,000 and non EU was 227,000 [(source)](https://fullfact.org/immigration/eu-migration-and-uk/). 24,000 EU and 104,000 Non-EU migrants came here to study and so will almost exclusively be housed in student accommodation. That leaves just short of 200,000.
Sadly I couldn't find figures for 2017 but in 2016, 85,000 people came to the UK to accompany others [(source)](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/bulletins/migrationstatisticsquarterlyreport/may2017) and so don't put additional pressure on the market.

Hewwo thewe x3!

We're *&lt;OwO&gt;* and we're looking for people to raid with during BFA.

***What are we going to do?***

After deciding the mythic raiding life is not for us anymore, but pugging is a nightmare as well, our group of friends has decided to set up a guild with which we clear the newest released raid on heroic until we have it on farm, and then after that we cut our raiding days down to one until the next raid comes out, in which we will do the same. We're still figuring out the set days for when the raid comes out according to peoples schedules. Sometimes if people are up for it we might raid 3 times a week (Most likely on raid release) and sometimes we might just raid 1 day. The initial plan is to raid 2 days a week until we have Heroic on farm, and after that we're cutting down to 1 raid day a week. Raid times will probably be around 19:30/20:00 to 23:00 server time. (Or until how long we feel like, be it earlier or later)

***What are we looking for?***

We're looking for a **healer** to fill out the roster so we have a bit more than 10 people to depend on to be able to raid. Currently we have a roster of 14 people. We're looking for people who fit in to our group personality wise, skill at the game is secondary to that. We're looking to have a group of chill and relaxed people, and to have fun while raiding. I guess that the type of person we're looking to have in our guild is the kind of person who can laugh about having OwO under their character name. Even though we're on Draenor, we wouldn't mind raiding with people crossrealm if they fit in with the group and don't want to server transfer (Or if you want to raid with us but also already have a guild, we don't mind sharing)

You have failed to give any example of bullying, or indeed vindictiveness. Your last example was of a country being asked to meet criteria for stabilising itself in order to secure a bail out.

It sounds more like an episode of The Americans with a dash of Mad Max and Fight Club mixed in. Yet this is exactly what is happening across Europe and North America as Russia’s intelligence services co-opt fringe radicals and angry young men to try to undermine Western democracies from within. And not just in the virtual world, but in real life.


And later:
&gt;Right-wing groups are more easily drawn into the Russian orbit with anti-immigrant, anti-LGBTQ, and anti-feminist rhetoric and by a narrative that **stresses a collectivist,** tribal, and racially exclusive worldview.

&gt;Finally, the Western radical right is attractive to the Kremlin not only because it provides a pool of recruits—often angry young white men—for stirring up social protests, but also because it serves as a backdoor for establishing ties with far-right political parties and anti-establishment politicians.

I understand that information about the Pecolumbian americas is much harder to come by then other areas of history, and that doing research can be *extremely* challenging if you don't know where to look, but the amount of just zero to minimum effort videos is staggering. Off the top of my head:

- The classic misconception of the ""Aztec, Maya, Inca"" as a trio of complex american civilizations is universal (the Aztec/Maya and Inca are from two independent cradles of civilization, both of which have many, many other comparably complex cultures and civilization)

- Calling these groups ""tribes"" when in reality they lived in urban cities, have signficant social stratifcation with social classes, nobility, and economic and adminstrative systems, and state goverments

- Talking about the Maya as if they are a singular culture or empire, wheras they had a bunch of seperate (though linked via political unions and ruling-subservient relationships) city-states and kingdoms, with MANY different ""maya"" cultures, with Maya being an *entire language tree with over 30 languages*; and that they just vanished after the end of the Classical period

- Repeating myths about the Conquest of Mexico, such as that the Spanish were successful due to superior technology (was a factor but not a large one), or that it was over with the fall of the Aztec empire as if there weren't many, many other empires and city-states in the region

Etc. 

Even channels that clearly *did* do some research fall prey to eurocentricism in general. 

Emperortigerstar's [The History of North America: Every Year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IKcS4DlaTw) video, for example, shows that he did do research, with the mention of The Zapotec, Epi-Olmec, Teotihuacan, The Mixtec, the Huastecs, the Purepecha/Tarascan empire, etc, but generalizes these and the Maya by culture, rather then showing the rise and fall of specific city-states and political alliances. I realize that the amount of research that would require would be *insanely exhaustive*, since that info is much, much more obscure and is less clear then for many european states, but the info is still out there for many cities and key alliances and he could have at least done them for key cities like Monte Alban for the Zapotec, many major Maya Cities, since their political histories escaped spanish destruction and are well documented, etc..... 

Likewise, BIll Wurtz's [history of the entire world, I guess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuCn8ux2gbs) mentions Norte Chico, Teotihaucan, the Misssipsians etc, things that clearly showed he at least *bothered* to do more then a typical wikipedia skimming, but he mentions the Americas, like, what 6 times in the entire video when he *easily* could have done quips and jokes about events like he did for europe and asia far more then that, especially since unlike with Tigerstar he doesn't need to show specific or roughly accurate borders. In fact he could probably do an entire seperate video on mesoamerica alone in the same style a la his japan one.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, with that all said, i'd like to spotlight the few *good* videos on Mesoamerica and the precolumbian americas in general.

- The Kings and Generals channel, in conjunction with Cogito (who I believe is /u/JackManiels) did a stellar series of videos on the Aztec, Maya and Inca (I don't know much about Incan history but based on what I do know it checked out), which are now unlited, but are being replaced by [even more in depth videos on them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfDdeNmZJY4&amp;list=PLaBYW76inbX5xFVjwMXSPd-UFSa3LQ_mq), with a 4-parter for the Inca, and a 3-parter for the Maya done, and the Aztec on the way. Again, sort of falls prey to the ""great 3"" myth, but the accuracy and level of detail in the info provided is nearly flawless. (I can also give links to the old versions, if people want)

- Epimetheus's [History of Ancient Mexico, Aztecs, Maya and more Explained in ten minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfSTd6FRrVM&amp;) is a pretty solid overview of Mesoamerican history. It's not perfect, but it's *far* better then 99% of the content covering it on youtube. 

- Crash Course's [The Americas and Time Keeping: Crash Course History of Science #5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCBDUDwaeCA) is pretty solid as well. I normally dislike Crash Course since it tends to be very eurocentric and the very, very few times till now it's delved into Mesomaerica has been barely adequate, but this is a pretty strong overview. 

- Overly Sarcastic Productions's [Miscellaneous Myths: Quetzalcoatl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=451jzIesWoU&amp;list=PLGTfwcb8YUlDnvXQ6_SgP6GtXpXsKE_US&amp;) and [Misellaneous Myths: Huitzilopotchli](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj-jDOjBets). Again, like Epimetheus's video, not perfect, but very, very solid with way less issues then almost all other videos on youtube. Less solid is their [History Summerized: The Aztec, Maya, and Inca](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC0PgqB-XuE&amp;) which has a fair bit more problems, and if most content on youtube about the americas wasn't so awful I probably wouldn't reccomend, but it's still heads and shoulders above much of it's competition, but I have some reservations with reccomending it,.  

- Another recommendation with a grain of salt is  Ollie Bye's [The History of Mesoamerica: Every Year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8yy5fg9Ohw). This is basically what I wish EmperorTigerstar and every other ""map over time"" video covering mesoamerica was like, documenting the rise and fall of specific states rather then just generalizing stuff as ""maya"" or ""mixtec"" into giant blobs (albiet still not to the extent I would like, basically not showing any of the hundreds of the central mexican city states the Aztecs would eventually conquer) but even I aren't knowledgeable enough to attest to the accuracy of many of the specifics shown in it, and I do see some stuff that strikes me as iffy: The Maya Kaan kingdom, IE Calakmul's kingdom, surviving past the end of the classical period till 900CE before Mayapan swallows up most of the northern yucatan, when Calakmul, as far as I know, lost a massive war towards the end of the classicwhen Tikal and other city-states rallied against them, as an example of one iffy thing I see, another is the mention of a ""First toltec civil war"", which i've never heard of or are even aware we have specific enough records on the toltecs to know about

Most of these videos I have left comments on detailing the few errors they've made, so if you are curious about what those are load all comments and search for ""Jabberwockxeno"". Some of them I haven't commented on yet but I will over the course of the next few hours since I'm making this post and want people to know what bits are off or are potentially off. 

For convenience here are direct links to my comments on these videos with corrections or additional info. I'll update this as I leave comments on the ones I haven't yet. 

- For the Kings &amp; Generals Maya videos, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sK9yv5wAoY0&amp;lc=UgwAYOWWJBHuvi52vU14AaABAg) is my comment on the first video. On the second, sadly, my comment got eaten by a spam filter, and while K&amp;G said he cleared it, it's still not publicly visible. [here's](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DjCzLDFX4AEsssJ.jpg) a screenshot of it, however. On the final maya one, my comment is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxwxTgFVUDE&amp;lc=Ugx_fgG-x-y2Z3PYo8h4AaABAg)

- My comment with corrections on Epimetheus's video is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfSTd6FRrVM&amp;lc=UgypoKE7xof2tlLRBit4AaABAg)

- On the crash course video, I had a very, very detailed and highly upvoted comment with corrections and added info, but like with the one on the second Kings and General video it got marked as spam and even though I messaged some of the people who run the channel to fix it, and they said they did, it's still not visible publicly. [here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dic-0eHW4AAhImZ.jpg:orig) is a screencap of it, though

There are two mistakes right now - leaving the country to teach english made it hard to transition back home into a real job and the criminal record just seals the deal.  I don't think causing property damage is as serious as assault or drinking under the influence, so its not as serious a problem as you might think it is.  The career gap of 3 years and being overseas is probably the bigger issue.

Volunteering will not help unless its for an organization that directly aligns with your skill set.  Helping little suzie read or being a big brother to mikie is something that companies dont care very little about.  Doing payroll for a non profit - most definitely.

There are two ways to get around this issue....and its important to realize that corporate jobs are probably never going to happen again.  That career gap is a killer. 

I would look for industries that care more about what you can do, not what check boxes you have.  So construction, sales, restaurant management, etc.  Anything that requires certs like IT or accounting - no

Then when you have saved up enough, you should probably think about moving to a different area - perhaps overseas.  North americans tend to view foreign job experience as worthless - and so when you went to teach english overseas, it was a huge mistake.

Regardless of why you think a Palestinian state doesn't exist,  the fact is that it doesnt.  


&gt;Refugee status is never passed down, except for Palestinians. I’m talking about the Palestinians who were born in other countries. 

Which other countries precisely.  As refugees in general tend to live outside their own country,  and give birth outside their own country too.  Their children are very often classified as refugees too! 

Secondly,  I already explained that Palestine does not exist,  hence the are refugees to a country that doesn't exist,  hence why their status is inherited until such a country does exist or they are readmitted.  Look,  if are American your nationality can be inherited,  Palestinians cant do that,  as Palestine doesn't exist. 


&gt;For example: If my grandfather came to Canada as a Palestinian refugee many years ago, and My father and I were both born in Canada, we would all be consider refugees. 

&gt;In truth, my father and I aren’t refugees, were Canadian. That’s why the number of Palestinian refugees has increased from ~800,000 to millions today. 


1. What is the  status of children born to refugees in Pakistan,  Europe,  israel etc?   Are they considered refugees? 

2. Again Palestine doesn't exist.  



&gt;Those Palestinians living in the West Bank under Palestinian leadership shouldn’t be considered refugees either. 

Why?  If they and their families fled a war in israel and have been stopped from returning or fear persecution if they do. That's what refugees are. 

&gt;Those living in Jordan and Lebanon should have been integrated into society years ago, but they haven’t because other Arab countries want to keep the Palestinian issue alive instead of actually helping the Palestinian people. 


Why cant they just return to their homes?  Is Israel not in the least bit culpable here?  

&gt;Also, what about the 800,000 Jewish refugees who were forced to leave Arab countries in 1948. Israel integrated them into society, unlike what the other Arab states did for the Palestinians. 

What about them?  Im not sure which countries forced them to leave,  but israeli very often encouraged them to leave.  Now lets imagine that after 60 years they had been stopped from returning to their homes having fled a war, what would we call them.

You acted like this concept was a joke, and that it wasn’t real.  All I have done in posting those links is demonstrate you should read more.  The world is more complex than your uninformed opinions.

Here's a different sort of example. The HGTV cable network has a Canadian version. If you watch that one, you will see a much higher amount of Canadian content. There is one show I saw when in Canada, *Leave it to Bryan*, which seemed intended for exclusive consumption by Canadians.

Outras áreas que pegam químicos mas a competição fica maior porque também pegam engenheiros (principalmente) e farmacêuticos são indústrias alimentícias, farmacêuticas, cosméticas etc.

&gt;That the Axis win at all. Without America in the war, what conceivably would have happened was the USSR just beating the Axis with manufacturing power and size alone. In fact, this story could have just as well been the US and UK vs. Communist Europe.

Agreed.  However, in this timeline, the Nazis get the atom bomb before December 1945.  They actually deploy it in December 1945, which is same month that the US tested their first nuclear bomb in the real world.  We don't know exactly how long they've had it for, but it's plausible that it was either directly used, or the threat of it's existence was indirectly used, to encourage the USSR and the UK to surrender.  Also remember that the USSR was very strained up until June 1944 with the D-Day landings that opened a second front.  The entire point of the second front was to relieve the USSR from having to fight to entire war on a single front.  

Again, it's easy to imagine that without a Western front, the Nazis could have rolled over Moscow, especially with the fact that the Allies were conducting an operation to deceive the Nazis about the timing and location of the invasion.  So you can imagine that if you are expecting a massive army of two large powers to open up a front, you are going to delay any new operations/advancements on the existing front, committing defenses to the west and prevent the distraction.

&gt;The Nazis' technological progress is ridiculous in every shape and form. The show seems to show them using Maglevs in New York and Berlin. However, the Maglev concept was created by a British RAF engineer, Eric Roberts Laithwaite, who would conceivably have been killed or imprisoned, his research lost to time. I will give credit where it is due for the depiction of cars in the series; very, very well done.

You don't need to stew on this one.  They are definitely using [monorails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_15_\(S%C3%A3o_Paulo_Metro\)), which are distinct from [maglevs, which look very similar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transrapid).  Monorails run with wheels on a large single rail that they wrap around for guidance, while a maglev floats around it's monorail. [Newer monorails float inside a trench](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maglev#/media/File:Series_L0.JPG).  [The Disneyland monorail was built in 1959](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disneyland_Monorail_System), and one of the oldest monorail systems is actually a [suspended monorail in Germany that was originally built in 1901,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuppertal_Suspension_Railway) so it's historically consistent that a burgeoning Reich with a strong economy could have come up with the system in the show.

...I like trains.

&gt;The Japanese allow Chinese arts to be practiced. I don't understand how the Japs become liberal in this timeline without domineering American influence, but there is no way in hell that the victorious Japanese Empire would allow the presence of Chinese culture.

I'm split on this.  There was a lot of anti-Chinese sentiment in WW2 Japan, and at the time they were eager to expand their empire, so I would agree that they would be trying to stamp out the culture in favor of their own.

However, Japanese history is *chock full* of absorbing aspects of Chinese culture, notably the Chinese alphabet (until it was redesigned by the same guy who imported a new version of Buddhism from, you guessed it - China).  When the Nazis deride the Japanese for their adherence to the chi of the furniture in the German Embassy in San Fransisco, recall that this is part of the revision of Buddhism they got from China.

&gt; The dropping of the bombs on D.C. Just to be clear, I think the Nazis knew very fucking well that NYC was a far more diverse place than most of Europe, with people immigrating from all parts of the continent. And if a German invasion happened, it would be disastrous, in any shape or form, for the Nazis to try to take the city, which would have been furious at the failure of the U.S government, which would have just made any occupation harder. Why didn't they drop it on New York and not on Washington?

Because that's where the President, his cabinet, his generals, and the heads of agencies responsible for governing the country are located.  And with a nuclear bomb in an age when they were just being invented, there were no fallout shelters, reinforced bunkers, etc.  If they had known it was coming, the President might have fled via car, to be caught by an invading army, or tried to hole up in a bathroom and gotten flattened.

When the Americans attacked Japan, they attacked industrial and military targets, because they were interested in trying to lessen the momentum of the Japanese Army and Navy, and throw Japan into something of a war of attrition, which they were already facing from being a small island nation.  

The Nazis knew that their best chances at expanding their power was not to destroy the infrastructure of the US (meaning that they did not attack major manufacturing and cultural centers like Chicago or New York) but to remove the leadership, occupy the land, integrate the people that they could and subjugate the rest into being at least complacent and passive, but still participate in the economy that is now run by the Reich.

Also, while I'm sure it would have given Hitler a boner to methodically raze Washington brick by brick and build it into New Berlin, New York does make sense to me as a governing point, as it's closer to Germany via Atlantic air routes, and it is the de facto cultural center of the US.

&gt;The buffer zones. Does anyone think that these buffer zones, as large as entire U.S states, are fertile ground for the Resistance? Did no one think of that when they wrote up the maps?

I totally agree with this.  It's basically a festering wound of uncontrolled land.

However, I would point out that the Resistance is very active in the Reich territory, almost more than it seems to be in the Neutral Zone.  Sure, there are tons of Resistance members in the Neutral Zone, but they are not about to invade the Western Border.  Meanwhile, Resistance cells in New York are able to attack Obergruppenfuhrer Smith in broad daylight, and cause some serious trouble in Atlanta.

To be specific about the left, there seems to be a kind of radical totalizing worldview, leading to vindictiveness and moral hysteria, where they try to utterly destroy people's careers and personal lives over increasingly minor transgressions.  Fewer leftists seem to vocally support the basic civil rights enshrined in our constitution, and instead support more restrictions under the guise of regulating hate speech, mass shootings, Russian trolls, etc.  In Europe, the left has acquiesced on criticizing Islam / the burka, and instead supports Muslim mass migration, in blatant opposition against most Europeans' who want Muslim migration stopped.

That said what's important is that you have fun really, if that's what you wanna do go ahead.

On to advice, it sounds like you had some really bad luck with your ruler's death at 31 here, which can sadly always happen. That said I recommend having a lot of kids quickly with your first ruler so they and their descendants can act as a safety net to avoid having no heirs at all. As a pagan ruler, you should be able to take up to three unmarried women as your concubines to ensure high kid output if you need to. And if you don't have any heir or your heir is not very suitable due to being a literal baby, try to avoid dangerous situations such as leading battles.

I think your guy is a tribal romuva pagan, right? If so, your best tools of warfare are going to be actions found in the intrigue tab, ""raise tribal armies"" and ""raise zealots"" (or something). The first costs 500 prestige and summons 2500  cheap soldiers in your capital, who will fight for you until you're at peace. The second one can only be used when defending in a religious conflict (such as your holy war here), costs 200 piety, and gives you 2000 slightly better troops than the other one who will also fight until the end of the war. If you keep enough piety on hand, even if the whole of europe attacked you at once you might be able to push them back.

Also, as long as you are unreformed pagan, non-pagans will take huge attrition penalties in provinces you own that are of your religion. Essentially, they shouldn't be able to pile up much more than 3k troops in a single province, without taking heavy losses every 15 days or so.
If you are getting attacked in land of your own religion, it is a viable tactic to wait til the enemies are at your gates, and then some, before attacking their by then severely depleted armies.

Do you know how to research these things yourself?

I just went to the FBI web site and looked at the list of things that exclude you from employment.  Guess what?  You do have to pass an extensive background check, and having Asperger's would probably make it harder to get through that, but it's still possible.  I also personally know multiple people with Asperger's who have passed the more rigorous background check required for employment at the NSA.

I'm intimately familiar with the process for various federal background checks.  My wife works for the federal government as has a similar clearance.  We've been through several of these checks.  She has multiple conditions that require disclosure and none of them have ever been an issue.

I've posted the list of exclusions for the US Military for you multiple times.  Asperger's is not on that list either.  What does exclude you is being medicated for psychiatric/neurological conditions, but there's nothing specific to any particular condition.  Once again, if you want to continue making the claim that you are excluded from military service in the US, produce some documentation.

You may not understand this, but most other countries have many more restrictions that the US does.  Most of Europe does restrict employment in all the ways you are describing, for example.

For the record, I just checked on requirements for the Police in Fairfax County, VA, where I live.  And also for the VA State Police.  Asperger's does not exclude you from employment with either.  Now let's try the Colorado State Police ... guess what?  You are out of luck again.

No, it doesn't. If Labour said that they wanted to maintain membership of the single market, then the manifesto would have made that clear. The manifesto instead says

&gt; strong emphasis on retaining the benefits of the Single Market and the Customs Union

The key here is the phrase ''strong emphasis on retaining''. You cannot logically retain something unless you plan to leave or withdraw from something. Furthermore, it doesn't say all benefits, instead, it leaves it vague as ''the benefits'', which can mean all or some, of which it becomes obvious that they have to only mean some given they also say FoM must end (which means being out of SM as a full member).

What the manifesto means logically speaking is as follows.

&gt; A) Leave the EU, SM and CU (this point is further supported by the intention to drop FoM which the EU made clear dropping FoM will mean the end to full access of the SM).
&gt; B) Attempt to access some of the SM/CU (after leaving FoM) to which cannot breach the agreement to end FoM.

Labour made it clear that FoM will end. What they don't make clear is to what extent will they retain access to the SM/CU and this is the crux of the problem.

The logical outcome of this is that the SM/CU aspect of the manifesto will be the primary point of negotiations, not FoM. FoM must end and whatever the consequences of that are (i.e abandoning full EU membership of the SM) must happen with it. 

I fully agree with you that it was wasn't clear but ultimately if you dissect the words of the manifesto it becomes clear that there are either porkies being told here or they're going for a hard Brexit (unless they remake something identical to FoM and just use that to get access to the SM, in which case it would have been such a disingenuous dishonest move by Labour that they'll have lost all credibility for me).",True,False,False,,0,1535821890,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e57yo1l,False,t3_9bxi3d,True,t1_e57hnla,/r/ukpolitics/comments/9bxi3d/mary_creah_mp_frank_field_gave_40_years_service/e57yo1l/,,1538559621,1,True,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,r/ukpolitics,public,,

It's older than the coalition, but Cameron exaggerated this by preceding over a period of serious economic stagnation and decline for many British people. The Tories and the Tory aligned media then blamed this decline not on the poor job the Tories were doing in economic 'recovery', but instead on the EU and immigrants.

Yeah, that's how tariffs go. Just as tariffs on Canadian cars will screw American buyers, and cost the shareholders of Ford, GM and Chrysler billions (if we pretend that Chrysler is an American company). Further, you understand that most cars are made outside of the US, right? The US sells something like 3 million cars a year to Canada...lol, goodbye.

""Good thing they can they can always buy Canadian cars...wait.""

Ignoring that you seem to be under some delusion that all cars are made in the US, it's actually funny seeing notions about the nationality of car companies. GM sells more cars in China than they do anywhere else. They are, in essence, a Chinese company. Chrysler is an Italian company. Ford is a multinational company that would happily produce cars for Canada in the EU or Mexico.

Nowhere did I say a thing about the US. The US can do whatever they want. But the funny thing about ""dirty"" oil is that you upgrade it, and Canada made the mistake of upgrading in the US, just as refining went to the US.

That doesn't really matter. Violence is found whenever something is enforced as well.

You have to consider the present, not the past.

&gt; Private property cannot be ethical if the way it was founded was both unethical and created massive advantages for some actors from the getgo

Yes it can. There's no record or proof that the property can be given back to the original owner.

&gt; they're really glad these past violences have happened and prefer that the current arrangement of ownership was established through violence.

You can play this game until antiquity and beyond. The world worked through violent conquest. Africans slaughtered Africans. Natives slaughtered natives. Europeans slaughtered Europeans. Etc...

And property wasn't always at the center.

&gt;  reveals that these violences still dictate who's likely to succeed

Nope. No robust analysis exists that compares the amount of violence suffered by various groups in relation to their current income levels.

Something you don't understand is that it's nigh impossible. Reality is immensely complicated.

Anti-Turkish sentiment has always been a thing. Which to be honest, isn't that surprising given that Europe was held for a long time. But let us not kid ourselves. Turks here don't get irritated because of anti-Turkish sentiment. They are angry at the absolute hypocrisy and the two-facedness displayed by the west.

We have seen how Westerners all too readily ignore the Turkish suffering experienced during the 20th century and before. We have also seen how people, such as yourself, had shut their eyes and ears when various Arab cities were bombed in to oblivion by the USAF. Where thousands of civilians were indiscriminately massacred. While also crying foul at any imagined (fire in Tunceli) action by the state.

This doesn't prevent them from being threats or supporting threatening groups. In fact the dude you replied to was lamenting over the idea that even openly supportive nations don't know or want the what's best for Turkey.

&gt; geographically Russia is European but we both know I am referring to ""europe"" in the political sense.

It sounds more like you're referring to western Europe.

&gt; You're basically saying any country that has any sort of conflicting interest with yours, or has relations with other countries than yours is a threat to you.

You're the one who converted this: ""We should let our nations safety rest on their good will."" to mean ""direct and overt threats""

Everything I've mentioned are valid examples on why relying on European good will is not the smart choice.

&gt; It is like Greece saying Europe is a threat to them because they are the largest foreign investors in Turkey.

By the way they're really annoyed about that at times. They go between ""Turkey is calmer this way"" and ""we should hope that Turkey isolates from Europe""

&gt; Mate, Greece isn't a threat to you get off it. Tsipras would probably let you have the entire Aegean if you asked nice enough. This sounds more like a dispute than anything, Greece has these claims but what have they actually done to enforce them? from what I have heard it sounds more like Turkey has taken the more active role of harassment and threatening actions that go beyond diplomatic disagreements. Sevres syndrome is alive and well

European ""good will"" would hand practically the entire sea and its resources over to Greece which in potential future conflicts can cause immense pain for Turkey due to a variety of geographical factors. I can go through a few if you'd like. You're the one obsessing over your own words, I never took ""threat"" to mean existential or immediate, direct, lethal harm.

Unless you want to live in an over-crowded hellhole (I really don't), that means we can only take a comparatively small number of people in.

However, there are tens of millions people looking to migrate to Europe already, and with the African population predicted to grow to over 4.2 billion by the end of the century and the on-going climate change we're looking at likely hundreds of millions potential migrants in the coming decades.

I get it that these people are looking for a better life for themselves, but it is simply unustainable. We are destroying ourselves by letting them all in. Altruism is fine and dandy, but not if it becomes self-destructive, a  point which we're already long past if you ask me.

We don't have to ban all immigration, nobody seriously suggests that. It's not Japanese or Swiss or Canadian or Australian migrants that pose any problem here. It's the MENA migrants, the Africans, the arabized Muslim Asians (Pakistanis, Bangladeshis etc.) that are the problem, both the legal, but especially the illegal ones and the asylum seekers. Even there are a few exceptions, Iranian migrants for example are doing rather well in Europe. But if we would ban immigration from these problematic countries of origin we were all better off. And we could still have immigration from the other, not-so-problematic areas of the world.

Apart from that I think that people have  right to stay the majority in their own countries, something which is increasingly threatened by mass immigration. White Brits are now the minority in several British cities, most prominently London of course. Same in Germany, same all over Europe. 38% of kids under 6 have a migrant background in Germany. This is insane. And there need to be drastic measures to halt this development, including bans on immigration from certain countries and revised asylum procedures.

I do have a problem with calling it extortion (the practice of obtaining something, especially money, through force or threats). China doesn't have the military power to force any country to do anything. They do have some economic power but I do not know of any county that is sanctioned by China. Even the ones who formally recognize Taiwan are only penalized by China not investing there. 

I think it is highly disingenuous to say that China is the new colonists of Africa when they are now investing heavily in Africa when Europe and America have pulled out.

[This](https://imgur.com/a/5BRuzQB) is what European countries time zones would look like roughly, if they were adjusted to solar time (or call it standard/winter time), with some exceptions taking into account also current political and/or economic situations (Iceland's ""real"" solar time zone is -1, Ireland and Portugal could be argued also to be -1, Turkey is between +2 and +3).

It is definitely member states and countries own decision to choose which time zone they want to belong to, but I see this as the ""blank sheet"" from which to start (in cases where particular countries preferred to stay permanently summer-time, they would need to add +1 hour). Surely there are further adjustments to be made to such map, including taking into account the amount of cross-border trading and logistics (for example daily commuters between Germany-Benelux-France) and historical reasonings (the situation we have now).

And other politicians being shit/=a pass to McCain. Whataboutism is not an argument. Even if it was, McCain is literally the pinnacle of neocon behavior, he was shilling for wars till the day he died and repented ZERO times.

In short, McCain was a massive anti American POS who never learned his lesson, I hope his soul is tortured in hell and I make no apologies for someone who shilled for pointless wars, destroyed the lives of millions and was a deep state POS till he died.

Most villages in the UK have their own primary schools, and the nearest secondary may only be 30 minutes away (again, walking).

Hell, the population of my town is 130,000 and we have in total 54 schools. Add in the surrounding areas which brings the total population to 250,000 and the total amount of schools is over 100.

EDIT: I notice a few people saying ""When will European Redditors realise that the US is not like Europe"".

We don't comment on things like this to gloat, or to laugh at America. We do this because we actually like your country, and we want to see it become better. All our lives we consume American media (I'm literally watching NFL highlights right now), we see comments all over social media saying things like ""America is the greatest country in the world"", and then we see threads like this and we're shocked. You teach us that everyone should have equal opportunity, and then you tell us what it's actually like over there and we realise that's all a lie.

Is a child who has to wake up at 5:30 to catch a bus that will take them 2 hours to get to school for 7:45 going to have the same opportunity in life for a kid who wakes up at 8, spent 45 minutes eating breakfast and getting ready before getting into school for 8:55? (Me essentially). No, they aren't. I had 2 and a half hours extra sleep each night (assuming we went to bed at the same time - 9PM), I probably had a much healthier breakfast and I didn't have to spend 4 hours travelling each day.

No, we aren't going to get the same opportunities in life. Because I hear from a lot of people that they got nearly no sleep/breakfast at all. And both sleep and breakfast are super important to making kids actually attentive in school. It's the reason this bill was passed.

EDIT2: I'm well aware of population density, thank you very much. How about instead of telling me about it, you adapt our policies into ways they will work in the US?

**About DDG:** We are looking to recruit around 10-15 new members in anticipation of Forsaken from the US and Europe to bolster our roster. We are an intimate clan of 41 at the moment, concentrating on both PVE and PVP.  We will have regular raid groups scheduled for Tuesday evenings after raid launch.  We use GroupMe as our main communication app and have moderated and unmoderated chats covering a variety of topics, both Destiny-related and otherwise.  We are looking for mature guardians that plan to be ACTIVE throughout Forsaken and that are a good fit with our group.  Please see some general guidelines below.

* 18+ only

* Must be able to use the GroupMe app either on smartphone or desktop and adhere to chat rules (Main chat is SFW, no shitposting in LFG chat, no slurs or hate speech of any kind)

* NO TOXICITY. You are never to yell at fellow clanmates or get upset at them when conducting raids or any other activity.  Any alienation of fellow guardians is subject to removal from the clan.

* Guardians are required to check in one hour before scheduled raid times to ensure there is time to find a substitute in case something comes up.

* Above all, be inclusive and welcoming to all clanmates. We have clan members from a variety of backgrounds and geographic locations.  That means we keep it PC.  This is the internet and we are all friends and joke around, but nothing offensive is to be said.  If it is, it is to cease immediately once you are told something is offensive and that's the end of it.

**How to contact us:** Please contact me on either PSN or Bungie.net (Arctic_16) and tell me why you think you would be a good fit with us and/or what you are looking for in a clan, as well as a little about yourself and where you are located.

&gt; The rampage now stands as a high-water mark in the outpouring of anti-immigrant hatred that has swelled as Germany struggles to absorb the nearly one million asylum seekers who arrived in the country after Chancellor Angela Merkel decided to open the borders in 2015.That decision sharply divided Germany, with critics soon arguing that Ms. Merkel&amp;#039;s administration had lost control of the situation.

&gt; A thriving industrial hub in the 19th century, Chemnitz was badly damaged during World War II, then rebuilt as a model socialist city under East Germany&amp;#039;s Communist regime and temporarily renamed Karl-Marx-Town.The 7-meter-tall bronze head of Marx in the city center was once a rallying point for demonstrations that took place each Monday to demand the end of Communism; this week it was the rallying point of the far right.

&gt; &amp;quot;We have a strong neo-Nazi scene in eastern Germany, but we also have a strong current of far-right extremism in all of Germany - not just in Parliament but in society,&amp;quot; said Matthias Quent, who runs an institute that studies democracy and civil society in the eastern state of Thuringia.

## Os ""entãosistas” não pretendem que as suas ideias sejam mais úteis ou verdadeiras, mais libertadoras, mais instrutivas ou mais honestas. Pretendem apenas desviar o assunto daquilo que mais os incomoda.

Imaginem que se escreve sobre Orbán. Razões não faltam. Orbán manda cessar a alimentação dos requerentes de asilo de forma a que a fome os impeça de usarem o seu direito de recurso nas decisões judiciais que os afetam. A Universidade da Europa Central, em Budapeste, vê-se forçada a suspender todos os programas com refugiados por causa da nova lei húngara que pune com impostos extorsionários as organizações que ajudem refugiados, incluindo com assistência jurídica. Para completar, Orbán vai a Itália e promove a exportação das suas táticas para violar os valores com que o seu governo se comprometeu através dos tratados europeus.

A resposta não se faz esperar: “então e quando escreves sobre Nicolás Maduro e o desastre em que se tornou a Venezuela?”. Um tipo lá assinala que já escreveu (e voltará a escrever) sobre Nicolás Maduro e o desastre, aliás mais do que anunciado e doloso, em que Maduro e Chávez antes dele transformaram a Venezuela. Poderia até dizer que já não são de hoje os avisos sobre a demagogia, o autoritarismo e culto da personalidade que na Venezuela não poderiam deixar de dar em desastre — porque dão sempre em desastre (no meu caso poderia até acrescentar a autoria e a aprovação de resoluções condenando as violações de direitos humanos na Venezuela ou defendendo as liberdades políticas no país). Mal o faça, porém, célere vem o desafio: “então e os crimes do capitalismo? quando é que vão ser denunciados, julgados e condenados os crimes do capitalismo?”.

Boa pergunta. Antes de respondermos a essa, lá virá alguém com: “então os crimes do socialismo?”. E logo depois “então e os crimes do catolicismo?”. Não, espera, antes haveria que responder a “então e os crimes dos islamistas?”. E por aí adiante.

Se às vezes parece que boa parte daquilo que passa por debate público, na imprensa e nas redes sociais, é uma repetição infindável deste esquema — é porque é verdade. Em inglês há uma palavra para isto: o *whataboutism*. A wikipédia define o *whataboutism* como “uma variante dos argumentos *tu quoque*”, da expressão latina que significa “tu também”. Diz a wikipédia que o *whataboutism* é praticamente uma “ideologia nacional na Rússia de Putin”, que no entanto já tinha sido desenvolvida na União Soviética, onde a réplica “e na vossa terra há linchamentos de negros” era uma resposta corrente — tanto mais eficaz quanto verdadeira, diga-se — a qualquer crítica dos EUA à trágica situação das liberdades na URSS. Se assim é, a disseminação generalizada do *whataboutism* no comentário público e nas redes sociais é uma prova do triunfo metodológico de Putin. Digo metodológico, e não ideológico. Pode não haver muita gente a querer viver como na Rússia de Putin, mas não há praticamente recanto no espaço público que não esteja dominado pela sua forma de discutir.

E esse é precisamente o objetivo daquilo que decidi traduzir em português por “entãosismo”. Os ""entãosistas” não pretendem que as suas ideias sejam mais úteis ou verdadeiras, mais libertadoras, mais instrutivas ou mais honestas. Pretendem apenas desviar o assunto daquilo que mais os incomoda: que alguém tenha o topete de chamar a atenção para os crimes e as violações de direitos humanos que são levados a cabo pelos seus ídolos políticos.

Com isso perverte-se e corrompe-se uma bela palavra. Sim, porque é útil e importante iniciar uma pergunta com “então e?” e é bom fazê-lo para desmascarar um hipócrita. Mas quando o debate é só isso, enfim, os “entãosistas” logram uma vitória tática às custas de um fracasso intelectual e moral — deles e para nós todos.

É possível ser-se conservador, liberal ou socialista e ser-se decente, honesto e inteligente. Vou mais longe mesmo e direi que é por serem decentes, honestas e inteligentes que a maior parte das pessoas de quem discordo pensam como pensam — e ainda bem. Mas não é possível ser um “entãosista” e ser-se intelectualmente honesto.

False,Fiveos2,1473650961.0,,mon,[],,Monarchist,dark,text,t2_11ckr8,"1) why would you ask us this? it is clear that media and advertisements are obsessed with normalizing mixed race couples...and show it far more often than what realistically occurs, and far more often than people want them to. So what is THEIR motivation for doing this? Clearly they don't think marriage is all about love like you do. But what DO they think it is?

there are very real genetic consequences to a white person having a child with a non white person. Genetics are things that exist in the real world...they are not some ephemeral concept like love. If you have the genes to dive 200 feet like the bajou, then you can dive 200 feet. If you mix the bajou with some outside genes who do not have such genes, the offspring will NOT be able to dive 200 feet. This is tangible consequence.

2) Jews are distinct culturally moreso than genetically...and indeed many white gentiles who have been raised on jewish entertainment and jewish education have essentially become 'honorary jews'. 'caucasian' is a term limited to genetic categories if humans are split into five groups...and it results in middle eastern and north African populations being the same as European populations...but this seems not very useful as a scientific category because their history is so starkly different. If European genetics have been influenced by their distinct history, then splitting human genetic population into more than 5 groups is necessary to take note of that difference.

3) I don't really deny the holocaust...but nothing would be totally irrational about questioning your source for the shrinking jewish population. One thing we do know is that there have been many lies about the holocaust on both sides of the debate. Another thing we know is that many questions about the holocaust are illegal to ask...and in such a hostile environment we should not expect that truth is what wins out in popular opinion.

And yet she can apparently make claims like this, directly from the linked article:

&gt; If Britain loses its access to the EU single market for services, the competitiveness of its largest sector – along with 80% of UK jobs – will be at risk.

Firstly, there is no chance whatsoever, none, zero that every service industry would lose access to all customers elsewhere in the EU under any Brexit scenario, even no deal. No-one is going to abolish copyrights or stop designing new products because of Brexit, for example. For a start, the EU couldn't do those things without violating much wider international agreements to which it (or its member states) is a party, with rapid and devastating economic consequences.

Secondly, even if we could somehow lose all access to all EU services markets, there would *still* be no chance that every job in the entire UK services sector would be at risk. Walking to places within a quarter-mile of my house, I go past signs for:

- a GP surgery
- a dental practice
- various other health and care providers such as professional therapists
- multiple schools and other academic institutions
- several hairdressers and beauty salons
- a funeral director
- multiple gyms
- numerous shops, numerous restaurants, cafes and takeaways
- a furniture repair place
- a couple of motor vehicle garages and a bike repair place
- numerous small professional firms (lawyers, accountants, IT places, marketing agencies)
- a couple of small private hire/taxi drivers and a car/van rental place
- several private teachers for musical instruments, yoga and other hobbies
- a few different builders and other trades.

Presumably all of the associated jobs are among the 80% of our economy that represents the services sector, so apparently this person thinks they could all be lost because of Brexit. I don't believe her. About 5/6 of our economy is domestic production and consumption, and of the remaining 1/6, about half (depending on exactly what you're measuring) is trade with the EU and the other half is trade with the rest of the world. It's certainly possible that Brexit will do significant economic damage, particularly in the immediate aftermath of actually leaving, and particularly if there's no deal or only a very basic one, but even trade with the entire EU isn't *that* important to our economy.",True,False,True,comment score below threshold,0,1535845411,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e58mzbt,False,t3_9c4jic,True,t1_e587h4m,/r/ukpolitics/comments/9c4jic/ngaire_woods_prof_of_global_economic_governance/e58mzbt/,,1538570920,-14,True,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,r/ukpolitics,public,,

No es misión del sistema capitalista fomentar el pensamiento crítico,hacer que la gente piense,sino estupidizarla en una sociedad consumista y en la Argentina ello se  lleva acabo exitosamente para la clase dominante oligárquico-financista.

Los argentinos son emotivos, temperamentales por naturaleza,vaya a saber si en buena medida por su herencia latina como descendientes de italianos y españoles.

En el siglo pasado y sobre todo entre los años 30 a 40, la Argentina era un país con una economía primaria (agropecuaria) y dependiente del mercado inglés, gobernado por los hijos de una oligarquía vacuna (la llamada “década infame” ) que vivía de la renta de la tierra y de la explotación de peonadas (hombres y mujeres) en sus enormes  estancias.

El cierre de abastecimientos industriales por causa de la guerra, promovió una incipiente industrialización(sustitución de importaciones).

Sobre la base de enormes ganancias obtenidas durante el conflicto por proveer de alimentos a los países involucrados, el peronismo triunfante  intensificó el desarrollo de esa industrialización(muchas veces basada en subvenciones)a la que acompañó la urbanización y  proletarización de millones de ex trabajadores del campo (o simplemente desocupados).

(Cualquier semejanza con la España de los 60 es pura coincidencia )

De la misma manera que el estado de bienestar europeo fué producto de enormes ganancias obtenidas de la explotación sobre todos  de Africa y demás colonias, países semicoloniales y  dependientes, el enorme colchón de divisas y la necesidad de alimentar el funcionamiento de las fábricas, permitió a los argentinos disfrutar de su temporal **estado de bienestar**.

Duró tres o cuatro años y  finalizó cuando-terminada la guerra- la producción de los grandes centros industriales mundiales volvió a abastecer los mercados  a precios inferiores a los de la producción nacional incluso subsidiada.

Perón cayó en 1955 en medio de una crisis que habia comenzado algunos años antes, y de la disputa por el predominio mundial  entre el declinante imperio  británicos y el pujante  triunfador  de la guerra:los EEUU.

Argentina siempre había sido una rutilante estrella en la constelación del firmamento inglés. 

Entre los años 1955 (derrota de Perón) y el gobierno de Néstor Kirchner ,la Argentina ha vivido cincuenta años  entre golpes militares, con escasos períodos de estabilidad económico-social.

Frondizi; Illia; Perón; Isabel su mujer; Alfonsín; Menem; Néstor Kirchner y Cristina Fernández (seis o siete en 50 años) han sido los presidentes civiles entre unos cuantos militares y algún civil en períodos  que raramente superaron  el año. 

Los años en que gobernaron los militares fueron de represión, pero no solamente porque el pueblo luchaba por  restablecer la democracia, sino por las duras condiciones en que vivían las clases populares.

Y en los años  que gobernaron los civiles, esas mismas clases no vieron mejorar sus niveles de vida y trabajo sino que fueron y se sintieron  traicionadas en sus expectativas, por los políticos a quienes habian votado con entusiasmo y esperanza.

Es que siempre las decepciones son directamente proporcionales a las ilusiones ;y las ilusiones de este pueblo temperamental siempre fueron grandes.

Menem es el caso más típico de esta grave  desilusión.

Este hombre (peronista y torturado por la dictadura)  privatizó todo lo que tuvo a mano. 

Entre estas empresas nada menos que YPF(petróleo);Gas del Estado; Aerolíneas Argentinas; etc. , y hasta el Correo Argentino   que cayó en manos de los Macri.

Además estableció lo que llamó  “relaciones carnales” con los EEUU haciendo que el peso equivaliera al dólar ,abriendo  el mercado argentino a las multinacionales (libre importación frente a una industria débil) , subordinando la economía argentina a la norteamericana con el resultado conocido:desastre total y fin en el “corralito”.

 El recuerdo de la  época peronista de las vacas gordas  ha quedado fijado en la mente de los argentinos más allá de la generación que la vivió y explica-en buena medida- el éxito de los gobiernos de los Kirchner ,peronistas de nuevo cuño.

Durante sus mandatos se vivió una época en en la que  fueron muy altos los precios de los productos que el país exportaba.

También en esta época la burguesía argentina hizo buenas ganancias, lo que permitió recuperar beneficios sociales desaparecidos(“Tiburón que se baña, salpica” dicen los cubanos).

Ninguno de los gobiernos argentinos tocó las bases del poder de la clase dominante.

Ni se hizo una reforma agraria;ni se nacionalizó el comercio exterior y la banca extranjera siguió siendo la dueña del mercado.

La misma villa miseria que hace 50 años  se extendía a lo largo de  vías ferroviarias que conducen a estación Retiro,no solamente sigue allí,sino que ha adquirido- casi- categoría de ciudad, alargándose sobre la Gral Paz y ostentando orgullosamente la denominación de ""Villa 31"",con una población de 40.000 habitantes.

Y es una de las siete en Buenos Aires capital. 

                   --------------------------------------
La esperanza es connatural a la raza humana.

No se puede vivir sin ella, aunque penda de  un delicado hilo.

Esperanza en una satisfactoria  vida ultraterrena,o  en la mejoría de las actuales condiciones en ésta..

Y la esperanza en una vida mejor para sí, para  la familia y para  la sociedad es tanto más fuerte cuanto peor se vive.

Por algo proliferan las iglesias y las sectas en donde se va a rezar para compensar en el más allá la miseria de este mundo,  y también para que la deidad - en cuanto le sea posible- nos conceda la gracia de mejorar nuestra existencia en este valle de lágrimas .

Las peregrinaciones en Argentina  a la iglesia de la  Virgen del Pilar, a las de San Cayetano y San José Obrero(1º. de mayo)son multitudinarias y con el mismo fervor los apasionados argentinos se han entregado a los modernos apóstoles políticos cuyas efigies queman al sentirse defraudados, traicionados.

Pero necesitados de esperanza y para poder vivir, vuelven a creer…

Us kiwis are very easy going...  

however because of this 'easy going nature' when people are very direct (such as a lot of Europeans are) then some kiwis can get offended because they 'interpret' that person as coming across strong, forceful or arrogant.. 

For example, if the kiwi themself had said something as directly as what was just said to them, it would be they had a big 'issue' with that thing;  so when someone says something 'directly' to them, it comes across as if the person saying it has a 'problem' with it.

In shocking scenes, caught on camera, Neymar is seen holding the YOUNG CHILD in a Brazilian death grip, forcing the child's hands around his ample waist. The BABY BOY - at this point in tears - holds on, clearly in fear for his life. 

The £200M footballer who lives in a £20M, 8 bedroom house in Paris and employs 3 maids with heaving breasts then begins to mock and belittle him by removing his own shirt, and forcing it into the potentially orphaned child's hands. 

The potentially orphaned child, who could recently have been diagnosed with leukemia, continues to sob uncontrollably as Neymar picks him up and hurls him back into the stands, as horrified stewards watch on.

Pals spoke to The Sun to say that he has never done anything like this before, but one unnamed source confirmed he does this kind of thing all the time. 

Colin, from Kent, said 'I haven't seen it but it sounds disgraceful. He should be banned from football and from the UK. If these are the everyday actions of Europeans then we don't need them in this country.'

This piece is of Queen María Luisa of Parma (1789) in her court dress by Fansisco Goya - she was the queen of Spain by marriage and actually had a very interesting life.

She married to become Queen to her cousin, the firstborn son of the King of Spain, but only because there was no queen at the time so she just kind of got the position. Whe got a great education, but was too frivolous and impulsive to really capitalize on it. She was said to be ""intelligent, ambitious and dominant"" - her husband was way more interested in hunting and mechanics than state affairs, and to the anger if her father-in-law (the current king) she became *very* involved.

In fact when her husband became king, she attended the first meeting he had with his ministers, which was completely unheard of. She attended every meeting. Her favorite guard kept getting promoted, and actually was placed as prime minister. She kept dipping her hand into everything. People - royals and otherwise - did *not* like her. She was accused of poisoning two princesses, having tens of affairs, including the prime minister (yep, that guard), and of being far too involved in political affairs - she had a mob trying to kill her at one point. And it all came to a head when Napolean showed up.

Yes, *that* Napolean. You see, a very unpopular treaty with France happened in 1808, and her husband, due to riots, gave up the throne to his son. María (and the king) weren't very happy about this so she joined him with a meeting of the four of them to talk about it and try to appeal it. Napoleon hears that request and is like ""You know, I hear ya, but what about this - MY brother is the king instead?"" And her husband's like ""no"" and she's like ""no"" and their son, the current king, is like ""...what? No!"" And Napoleon's like ""but what if...I'm forcing you?"" And here comes the French army. Aaaaaand now Napoleon's brother is king. And now the people are pissed.

Of course of all the people blamed for  it is María. Not Napolean, the king, or her son, it was María that showed up on angry panflets at the time. The reasoning wasn't bad - she was one of the supporters of the initial, deeply unpopular treaty. She WAS part of the reason Naoplean wiggled in in the first place. So she goes from princess to prisoner. Actually, all three of them do, and her proported side piece, the prime minister, as well. And when Napolean falls, her son, who becomes king again, bans her, her husband, and the prime minister from Spain anyway.

That’s also why our dairy industry is managed: it’s a very capital intensive farming operation.

It costs money to transport all that supply to places where there’s not a huge customer base to support it. So, when prices go sideways, guess who isn’t getting served? 

Part of the reason why Canada is scattered as much as it is, is because in my grandparents lifetimes, we gave large tracts of land to people in the middle of nowhere to settle.

And despite your extreme beliefs in Social Darwinism, climate change will be a permanent, devastating blow that humanity, at least at its current industrial and technological capacity, cannot recover from. A significant percentage of the human population lives near the coasts, all the infrastructure created near the coasts would end up underwater, New York? gone! Miami? gone! The Netherlands? gone! With these cities goes the technical knowledge of all it's inhabitants as well as the infrastructure they contain that maintains an interconnected modern world. **Every** port used for shipping goods between continents would end up submerged and unusable. Underwater internet cables would become almost impossible to maintain and may even cease to function when their endpoints are also underwater. Satellite internet will also become unmanageable because access to space, at least for the United States and Europe, will be submerged. Almost all launch sites are built with a coast to the east. Satellites will become unmanageable before we can rebuild them and by the time we finish, the coasts will wash over everything we have done.

Climate change doesn't just affect sea levels. It also messes with our food supply. The dust bowl of the 1930's devastated the Midwestern US and made the great depression even worse. Climate change threatens us with a permanent and more severe dust bowl than the 30's. Man made pollution also threatens pollinating insects who we rely on for many of our crops to grow. The carrying capacity of the land will be drastically reduced by climate change.

The last, most damning nail in the coffin of humanity, will be the lack of easily accessible resources. When billions are forced to migrate away from the coast, and food supply is drastically reduced, societal order will most likely collapse. If humanity is not killed completely in the chaos, it could never recover to our modern level. In the 1600's, when Britain was first industrializing, There were minerals such as iron and coal easily accessible on cliff faces by the shore. Oil could be discovered seeping up out of the soil before it became a cheap power source for humanity. Since then the coal and iron have been stripped away and the oil has been pumped. We have either burned them, or refined them into different materials. We now rely on extremely deep mines and sophisticated techniques such as fracking to sustain ourselves. Techniques which could not be achieved with the technology of the early industrial revolution.

A non-Euro option would be a TSX Wagon. Super hard to find though. Plenty of VW options that are much more common in your price range.

Trump suggests remove troops and military funds from Europe since their economy is larger than ours and they can defend themselves; democrats oppose.

Trump suggests defunding or leaving the antiquated NATO agreement andthe UN military forces, which are more used as justification for the US to invade tiny non threatening brown nations than for actual defense; democrats oppose.

Suggest that we remove our troops from Japan which are only costing us tons of money, and escalating tensions with China. Japan has one of the strongest economies on the planet, so they could arm themselves if they want to; democrats oppose.

Suggests that the US remove some troops and weapon systems from South Korea; democrats oppose.

Suggest that we end our proxy war with Russia in Syria. The war which we are involved in for no good reason which has killed hundreds of thousands of innocent people and has caused a massive and unprecedented refuee crisis. Suggests that we enter peace talks with Russia to end it; democrats oppose. 

Trump proposes we limit arms sales and funding which many countries use for their millitary. Most recently Pakistan; democrats oppose.

Suggests that we actually try to talk with North korea rather than continue the unsuccessful multi decade silent treatment; democrats oppose.

I dont even like trump, but its clear as day. The Democratic party has effectively reduced themselves to being defined by nothing but ""anti-Trumpism"".

Such whataboutism. So the only defense is that Trump is worse? Those standards are about as high as Trumps approval rating (pretty low).

Absolute horrid night at the office for EPL. The results were not what I expected, with Crystal palace losing 0-2 to Southampton which surprised me. The other games were as expected but very low scoring games or games that did not meet my punting targets. 

&amp;#x200B;

Putting yesterday past us, we go again before the international break. 

**Cardiff vs Arsenal BTTS @1.77 -1u** 

Cardiff have not scored in 3 game in their EPL campaign, they will look to score at home to get their much needed 3 points. Arsenal showed moments of class and dominance however looked more inconsistent. They will look to get 3 points against Cardiff. All the other markets were not worth betting on, including straight wins on Arsenal. I do see Arsenal winning this match, but they will slip up in defense. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Burnley Vs Man Utd BTTS @2.03 -1u**

Absolute woeful performance at Old Trafford against Tottenham, there are alot of things I would want to rant about. But I am sure everyone on Social Media will have heard the garbage that has been thrown around in regards to Mourinho and the players. I hate to pin point players but why hasn't Lukaku been dropped? Every other player in the squad has been once dropped for their performance. I don't get why Lukaku can come out of the tunnels and not deliver anything. 

A game away from home is a must win for Man Utd, Burnley are out of the European tour, so they will look to concentrate to getting back into retaining a spot for Europa league or higher next season. So far burnley and Man Utd have been poor in defense, both side lack the clean and simple defensive system that most top clubs have in the EPL. With Champions League coming soon, Man Utd will have a more complex schedule moving forward. I feel like alot of players will be used rotating between competitions. De Gea will look to be playing all the games for Man Utd, he hasn't played this year and it is not his fault goals are going in either. 

Both teams will score tonight, inconsistency in defense kills any team whether if you are Real Madrid or Arsenal. 

&amp;#x200B;

These are the questions that I have fans and punters?

* Will Mourinho be sacked if they lose to Burnley tonight?
* Martial has not signed a contract extension but is included tonight for Burnley's match. Is the Manager and Martial's relationship really that bad?
* If it is bad, why is Martial playing, when there are so many options out there for the mid field?
* Rashford is a number 10, why is he not starting consistently?
* Lukaku or Ibrahimovic? 

**Watford vs Tottenham BTTS @1.70 -1u**

Good that Sonny is coming back to London! 

This game is going to produce alot of goals. There is so much attacking power on both sides, Kane, Lucas Moura, Ali, Erikson, Deeney, Gray, Pereyra, Hughs. You name it. Lloris is out so that is a big advantage to punters if we were to go BTTS. With odds being the same as Total goals 2.5, i think it is much safer in my opinion going BTTS.

GL to all, DYOR, see you all after the international break.

&gt;  
&gt;Google declined an invitation from the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to have CEO Sundar Pichai testify on Russia's meddling in the 2016 election.  
&gt;  
&gt;Google has largely avoided the recent controversies surrounding other tech platforms by letting Facebook and Twitter absorb all the public scrutiny.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Senate and the public deserve to hear from Google's top leadership, not its lawyers, about what went wrong and how the company plans to make things better.  
&gt;  
&gt;Steve Kovach	| @stevekovach  
&gt;  
&gt;Published 18 Hours Ago Updated 15 Hours AgoCNBC.com  
&gt;  
&gt;Beck Diefenbach | Reuters  
&gt;  
&gt;Google CEO Sundar Pichai takes the stage during the presentation of new Google hardware in San Francisco on Oct. 4, 2016.  
&gt;  
&gt;When the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence holds its next hearing on Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, it will hear from two of the top executives in the tech industry: Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg.  
&gt;  
&gt;Beside them on Wednesday could be an empty seat that's reserved for another high-profile leader. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has so far refused to accept the Senate committee's invitation to show up.  
&gt;  
&gt;Instead of Pichai, Google offered its top lawyer, Kent Walker, to testify. Walker, the senior vice president of global affairs, is the same guy who previously testified along with Facebook and Twitter's lawyers last year, which was a meek effort from all three companies at a time when Congress and the public deserved to hear from top leadership about how their platforms were so badly abused ahead of the elections.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Chances are there's going to be an empty chair there,"" Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va, told CNBC Wednesday, regarding Google's snub of the hearings. ""And I think there will be a lot more questions raised that could have been actually dealt with if they sent a senior decision-maker and not simply their counsel.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Warner is the vice chair of the Senate committee.  
&gt;  
&gt;Google has not said why Pichai or his boss, Alphabet CEO Larry Page, won't accept the committee's invitation. The company declined to comment Friday.  
&gt;  
&gt;It's a tumultuous time for the world's biggest tech companies, with Facebook taking most of the heat following the reveal of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal in March.  
&gt;  
&gt;Since then, we've seen Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg go through two marathon sessions of weak congressional testimony. We've seen him fumble through a self-inflicted scandal about posting Holocaust denial content to the platform. We've seen him squirm when asked why Alex Jones was still allowed to post bogus conspiracy theories, only to boot Jones off Facebook after a nod from Apple a few days later. We've seen a handful of top Facebook executives, including security chief Alex Stamos, leave the company. And on and on and on.  
&gt;  
&gt;￼  
&gt;

&gt;  
&gt;Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer and founder of Facebook, speaks during a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Wednesday, April 11, 2018.  
&gt;  
&gt;It's a similar story with Dorsey, who went on a press tour during the Jones controversy a few weeks ago and has faced a relentless barrage of scrutiny in the media, on Twitter and within his own company over how he's handled moderating all the vile content and abuse that infects the site every day.  
&gt;  
&gt;But Google has largely been able to skirt the controversies plaguing its rival platforms, letting Facebook and Twitter take all the heat while its executives shy away from anything that could put them in danger of public scrutiny.  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm not talking about manufactured and false controversies from the president about anti-conservative political bias in Google's search results, by the way. (But that's sure to be a good topic for conservative senators on the committee to distract from the hearing's stated purpose of looking into election meddling.) I'm talking about how Google has let its own platforms, ranging from Google search and Google News to YouTube, become abused and perverted over the years. I'm talking about how if you think Facebook plays it fast and loose with your personal data, take a look at how Google uses the data you provide to target ads based on your location, videos you watch, your search queries and even stuff you buy with your credit card.  
&gt;  
&gt;Google also allows third parties to access your Google services, including Gmail. Cambridge Analytica and other third-party apps were able to scoop up Facebook user data with little oversight or accountability. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this summer that Google also does little to police third parties that have access to users' Gmail accounts and their data. Plus, a few weeks ago Google admitted that some of its services can track your location, even if you selected to turn off location tracking.  
&gt;  
&gt;Free pass  
&gt;  
&gt;And yet, Google is getting a pass. Facebook and Twitter have been wildly inconsistent and confusing in their responses to various scandals, but at least they're taking their shots in full public view. Google would rather send Walker to spew a bunch of legalese than hold its own leaders accountable, just like it did last year.  
&gt;  
&gt;Even more frustrating is the fact that Google's business appears to be immune to any controversy, giving leadership and investors zero economic incentive to own up to its issues. Google has a series of impenetrable moats around its business — it's the dominant search engine, has the top streaming video site, the most popular web browser, the most popular email service and makes the operating system that powers practically every non-Apple phone on the planet.  
&gt;  
&gt;Because of all that, Alphabet is healthier than ever, reporting close to $33 billion in revenue last quarter. Even the European Union's record $5 billion Android antitrust fine against Google was nothing more than a financial blip for the company, and will do little to stop its dominance in mobile. Google's stock, meanwhile, keeps climbing.  
&gt;  
&gt;But those are also the very reasons Google should send Pichai to testify on Wednesday.  
&gt;  
&gt;It's because Google is so big. It's because it has built so many moats around its businesses. It's because it needs personal data from users to make its billions. It's because it built a suite of powerful platforms ripe for abuse from Russia and Iran. That's what makes it so offensive that Google won't take its responsibility seriously enough to put its leader in front of the Senate and explain how it's going to do better.  
&gt;  
&gt;Google should be examined in exactly the same way Facebook and Twitter will be on Wednesday.  
&gt;  
&gt;But instead the company will keep its CEO in Mountain View while his peers are in Washington. And that's an insult to the rest of us.

English is the language of the most powerful country and for awhile after world war 2 it was far and away the people you had to do business with if you didn’t want to deal with communist since most of Europe was busy rebuilding. China was also still largely isolationist. So the person who knew English had an edge over the one who didn’t. Even after the rebuilding the trend stuck because it made since to have a common language to do business in and English was already being used. The rest of the world went the same way because a large number of people from other nations already spoke it. This spiraled out to a lot of ordinary people. It’s like hey if I learn this 1 language I’m set if I want to do business and I can travel to most any other country and communicate with people. 
So yes it is pretty pointless for an English speaker to learn a second language. That 2nd language is only going to come in handy in a few places.

By a tiny, tiny amount. On the flip side, immigrants represent a high proportion of our builders; reducing immigration will make it harder for us to build more houses than we are now, which we need to do to solve the housing problem.

Barely. There are better ways to push up wages at the low end of the curve, and without damaging our economy (which stands to have a far greater negative effect on your wallet).

False,c_delta,1452979193.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_tuug2,"""The goal of socialism is communism"" is actually pretty much the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism. The idea that to transition to the communism Marx envisioned, a world without a need for property and authority, a somewhat dictatorial government would be needed as an interim solution. Such a government, staffed by people who follow the communist ideology, would have a strong hand in economic affairs and manage the communal property, ensuring that workers are productive and fed. Since such a strong authority is not compatible with the eventual goal of Marxian communism, they adopted a different term, ""socialism"" (compare ""Communist Party of the Soviet Union"" to ""Union of Socialist Soviet Republics"").

That said, the term ""socialism"" has gotten a lot broader since then. Many parties that once advocated for revolutions like the one in Russia have since turned away from Bolshevism and shifted their focus towards improving social security within a market economy after seeing how tyrannical and destitute the soviet-aligned world had become. Some kept the socialist label, some added ""democratic"" to the socialism to distance themselves from the communist parties of eastern Europe and Asia, some chose the term ""social democrat"" instead (the biggest German left-wing party has used the term since 1869; they would keep Marxist ideology in their manifesto for 90 more years, but not push for a revolution when they could improve conditions for the working class through bipartisan means).

So bottom line, the term ""socialism"" spans an incredibly wide range all the way from Marxism-Leninism (which aspires communism while embracing authoritarianism) all the way to social democracy (which merely defines one of the core tasks of the state as helping those who cannot help themselves and does not aspire communism).

26 factories under construction with capacities be in excess of a GWh per year

&gt;There are 26 battery ""megafactories"" that are either in production and due to expand capacity or new operations due to be in production by 2021, Benchmark said in a blog post on Monday. Benchmark coined the term ""megafactory"" to describe factories that produce more than 1 gigawatt-hour of total capacity in a single year.

&gt;China is still by far the dominant force in the industry with 49% of planned capacity totalling 169 GWh, the most recently added Chinese megafactory to the tracker was number 24, Great Power’s planned 10GWh plant in Guangzhou. Following China is the EU, totalling 23% of planned capacity or 78.5GWh. Prior to 2017, the EU was falling far behind the rest of the world, with just one plant planned by LG Chem in Poland with 5GWh capacity. The acceleration of activity in the European market was driven by two facilities – TerraE’s 34GWh facility in Germany and Northvolt’s 32GWh offering in Sweden. Europe is also the home for megafactory number 25, SK Innovations plant in Hungary with a capacity of 7.5 GWh. Whilst the US is third on the list, with 53GWh and 15% of capacity it is worth noting that Tesla has further expansions planned for the Gigafactory beyond 2021 and have stated publicly that they expect to be able to achieve 150GWh out of the plant, no small feat as they get to grips with the mass market scale of production of the Model 3.

The majority of those are between 10 and 55 GWh per year, Reno GF1 is currently producing at a rate of 35 to 40GWh per year, and on schedule to to hit 60 to 80 GWh per year by end of next year, the Tesla Shanghai plant (GF3) will be at 40-50 GWh per year.

Which puts total at between 450 and 492 GWh per year (yes, I rounded to 500)

EV battery cell density today is 250 Wh per kg, it was 160 Wh per kg 4 years ago.  Solid electrolyte  lithium batteries are at 400-500 Wh per kg and being released in less than 5 years, lithium Sulfur batteries are at 800 Wh per kg and batteries suitable for EVs are 8 years out.  At 280 Wh per kg, advanced EV batteries today are at 4 percent theoretical maximum for electro chemical battery storage.

Could you give me a good source to read up on Russian history? What I know is that you had a royal family (the Tsars) until social unrest reached a boiling point and the Russians 'traded' royalty for communism. After the USSR fell apart Russia became a democracy. 

What I would like to know more about is how the Russian people perceived communism, at first and how was it seen after a few decades? Did they welcome it or did they want to hang on to the royal family? Or did they not care at all as life was already difficult enough without having to worey about politics? 
And how did they feel about Soviet states separating? How did Russians feel about Jeltsin deciding to end the wall and conceding? I remember here we believed world peace was at hand the moment the Berlin wall was torn down. That how the nineties felt for me. 

How did the change from communism to democracy affect the Russians? I have read up a bit on this transition in former Soviet states that are now part of Europe, and know that its been far from easy, and it takes a very long time until a certain mindset is changed in a people. 
I am curious on how this is Russia.

Close enough, sou português. :p

&gt; That is the part that disturbs me most: maybe we don't have the God we wished to have. Good people dying, prayer doesn't working... if its all about living with Jesus, you should accept every tragedy but be joyful about Jesus living at your side. To be Christian is to accept the good and the bad, knowing that you are not alone... and all the pleasures or sufferings of this life are finite. 

Eu compreendo que ser Cristão é aceitar o mundo como ele é e ter fé que não estamos sós, que Deus quer o melhor para nós. Mas por isso é que eu insisto que se estude a história da igreja. Pois é a igreja que nos ensina que temos de ter fé na sua doutrina. Mas se estudares a história da Igreja vais começar a questionar-te se essa instituição merece que se tenha fé nela. E por ""questionar-te"" não quer dizer que venhas a chegar à mesma conclusão que eu. É bom questionarmo-nos e mantermos a mente aberta.

&gt; Its worth praising a God through Jesus and through repenting if this is the will of God. Maybe God doesn't consider your happiness much for the masterplan, but the rules are still valid: you have to bow down before him, love him, no matter what... This is what is making me suffer most: all can be a test and God likes to be praised... if he is the Creator, we are in debt and we are his workers, better do things his way.

Tens razão. Se ele é o Criador, estamos de certa forma a dever-lhe, literalmente, a nossa existência. E não tenho qualquer problema com isso. Mas não sei quem é o meu criador. O Deus Abraamico? Shiva? Outro Deus que não conseguimos sequer conceber? Uma reacção química sem consciência?

&gt; As for the corrupted priests and parts of Catholic church, I would answer that the fault goes on the humans. People that failed to deny themselves, and priest or not, will have damnation in the end because their true intent is not the one desired by God. Its all about you with yourself, and churches are not good parameters sometimes, but you should hang on the Bible, not on the human choices of the ones of the church.

Podes assumir que a culpa é dos humanos que são falíveis, ao passo que Deus não o é. Mas ao assumires essa posição não podes acreditar num Deus que tenha poderes para intervir na nossa vida, o que coloca as histórias da Bíblia em cheque. Se um Deus não decide intervir para parar com as anormalidades da sua maior igreja de estar constantemente a sujar o Seu nome por causa de uma pequena minoria de ""homens de Deus"" que só fazem porcarias (sim, eu reconheço obviamente que a maior parte dos católicos são boas pessoas), então ele não deve ter o poder intervir na vida das pessoas.

&gt; I honestly don't know what to do to go off my existential crisis. May I ask you if you are happy now (be honest with me)?

Se sou feliz? Há coisas na minha vida que quero mudar, mas estou a trabalhar para ser feliz. Todos nós procuramos o sentido na vida. Isto parece tudo tão irreal quando pensamos nisto. Qual é o sentido de crescermos, multiplicarmo-nos e morrermos? Se calhar não tem de haver um sentido inato. Eu acho que os seres humanos não são mais do que uma máquina complexa que tem consciência. E é nessa consciência que acho que se encontra a chave da nossa humanidade. A nossa razão de ser. Entristece-me a ideia de que um dia deixarei de ser consciente, mas nunca deixarei de ser. Sou composto de células vivas que hão-de continuar a sua viagem pelo universo muito depois de eu bater a bota. E isso faz-me sorrir de certa forma. Respondendo, por fim, acho que posso ser verdadeiramente feliz apesar de ainda não o ser. Mas sei que isso não depende da minha concepção sobre a vida e a morte nem sobre a existência de algo consciente maior do que eu (um deus supremo ou outras divindades).

- The wealth gap between the 1% and 99% is higher than ever
- No government since the 1999 democrats has had a surplus.  They caused the 2008 recession and then spent trillions of dollars trying to limp on ever since.
- Their continual divestment from education at all levels is resulting in adults who are less and less capable to hold STEM careers resulting in less and less economic output which is why immigration of STEM educated people is valued.

But ya, they'll be fine...

&gt; Care e problema? De ce protestăm? În comunităţile de români din străinătate se afirmă personaje cu clare simpatii legionare, rasişti, naţionalişti. Am văzut destui, gata să îşi verse opiniile de îndată ce scapă de “chingile corectitudinii politice”. Astfel de personaje organizează proteste, scriu scrisori dramatice şi fac presiuni asupra consulilor şi ambasadorilor pentru reacţii oficiale. Consulii şi ambasadorul român din Anglia s-au arătat ofensaţi de un documentar umanizant, care arăta greutăţile unor emigranţi, fără stereotipuri, fără regie. Protestatarii din faţa Channel 4 vor să demonstreze “că suntem altfel decât prezintă ei”: reuşesc să arate că diaspora românâ e plină de naţionalişti ridicoli.

To date, no transnational terrorist attack, linked to al-Qa'ida or an affiliate, has been carried out on German soil. **This is due above all to the vigilance of the German security services, who in many cases have intervened early and prevented terrorist groups from carrying out their plans.** *A number of German nationals have, however, continued to be victims of terrorist attacks in other countries.* **It must be assumed that unidentified terrorist networks or cells exist in Germany that are integrated into functioning cross-border structures and, to a large degree, can plan attacks independently based on their capabilities and the means available.** Germany also faces the possible growing threat of “lone wolf” Islamist extremists, lured by al-Qa`ida’s violent ideology yet having no connection to organized terrorist cells. These individuals hope to contribute to the “jihad” with smaller-scale, retaliatory efforts—similar to the action taken by Arid Uka in March 2011.

&gt;These cases demonstrate that jihadist activity in Germany is becoming more lethal. In the past, German territory was used by Islamist militants strictly to plan terrorist operations abroad.

False,Wabisabi_Wasabi,1478519805.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_12njph,"My PoV at the moment is that UK migration can basically be seen in about three eras:

1) 1970-1997: Relatively low immigration, mostly Commonwealth. Few Europeans come, because, despite FoM, relatively rich Western Europeans in growing economies didn't have much incentive. Cultural effects of migration are large, but the actual change in the population is relatively small, and political unrest and anger driven by migration is fairly low by present day standards.

2) 1997-2010: New Labour, New Nation: Labour party really opens the floodgates on student migration, low skill migration and high skill migration, from all over the world (probably mostly because of their ideology - ""*rub the Right's nose in diversity*"" - Andrew Neather). We also see Blair's government decide not to practice any controls on migration from A8 Eastern European accession states, resulting in an even bigger influx.

Industry quickly becomes dependent on lower wage workers, and higher education's funding on the influx of students.

3) 2010 - present: The Coalition takes power, and the Home Office under May basically introduces new regulations limiting non-EU migration to students, high skill workers and family (the last under fairly punishing restrictions). This is a real change in type of migration and not just window dressing.

But the Coalition, and then Tories alone can do nothing about EU migration, and so this surges in response to a stronger recovery in Britain than much of Europe, less competition from global migration, and a fragile industry with razor thin margins quickly grown dependent in the Blair-Brown era on foreign workers who are cheap for their levels of work ethic.

So, the question is now whether the Tories will implement a new era after Brexit. They could, in theory, restrict all migration to students and high skill migrants, both from the EU and the rest of the world. To do this would challenge and probably destroy the model of employing low skill, high effort migrants en masse, which flourished post-Major, in the Blair and then Cameron era. That's gonna cost business and it's gonna be a political hit. 

But the legacy would be a Britain which would genuinely become a global skills hub while retaining more of its national character and cohesion, if its stays the course.

Eu acho que um dos motivos dos problemas de relacionamento impactarem tanto é que nós temos a impressão que conseguimos controla-los. Eu tenho vários e vários problemas, mas a vida me faz tomar um posicionamento passivo com relação a eles. São muitas coisas do tipo 'eu ligo pra isso, mas o resto das pessoas não liga, então eu sou problemático e deveria ficar calado' ou 'o que resta é esperar'. Só que quando a gente vê todo mundo vivendo relacionamentos e você não da a impressão de que você não serve pra viver.

É meio insano. Geralmente quem almeija um relacionamento muito quer uma companhia, uma pessoa que se importe consigo, que queira compartilhar do tempo, a quem possa confiar e see íntimo. Mas há pessoas que querem sexo e status, pessoas que querem alguém pra sair quando estiver entediada, pessoas ficam com outras para aumentar autoestima etc...

&gt;The near total neglect of engineering, mathematics, and other applied science education by the state contributed to a vast gap in military power between China and the European empires, as evidenced by the outcomes of the First and Second Opium Wars and the Sino–French War amongst others.

A dossier of briefing notes and memoranda shows how disquiet has grown among senior civil servants as the UK’s split with the EU in March looms closer.

The files, obtained under the freedom of information law, include a paper circulated in June by the board of NHS body National Services Scotland (NSS).

It warned that low wage growth could lead to an “enduring squeeze” on households “with an implication for economic growth”.

NSS concluded that “this could further challenge public sector funding particularly in Scotland, with devolved powers placing an increasing reliance of self-funding for health”.

The disclosure was seized upon this weekend by politicians as evidence that further tax rises may be necessary to prop up key public services in post-Brexit Scotland.

“The Tories have threatened the NHS and for the first time we have in black and white that no-deal Brexit could mean tax rises to plug the gap,” said Alistair Carmichael, the Liberal Democrat MP for Orkney and Shetland. “You cannot have a strong NHS and a hard Brexit.”

This weekend, Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, said that continued uncertainty caused by Brexit must not derail the Scottish government’s “relentless focus” on improving public services.

Speaking ahead of Tuesday’s publication of the Scottish government’s programme for the year, she said: “The people of Scotland did not vote to leave the European Union but in this parliamentary year we are set to be taken out of the EU against our will. In the face of this uncertainty, we have to intensify our focus on improving the wealth and the wellbeing of communities across Scotland.”

The Scottish government files were obtained by Best for Britain, a group fighting to keep the UK open to EU membership.

They reveal that the effect of Brexit on the UK’s participation in the European atomic energy community (Euratom) is a source of anxiety, amid warnings that shipments of medical isotopes used in scans and cancer treatment could be jeopardised and that British power stations would struggle to source nuclear fuel if it cannot be legally transported across borders.

Health officials warned a hard Brexit would “remove the guarantee of consistent and timely access to radioisotopes, potentially resulting in delays in diagnosis and cancelled operations for patients”.

The effect of tighter border controls has also vexed officials. “Highly specialised talent remains internationally mobile and any barriers to immigration will impede the recruitment of the best scientists, clinicians and technical experts, undermining our competitiveness,” warned the NSS.

Of those, the most likely opportunity for an Irish veto is ""common foreign policy"".  A lot depends on the whether the withdrawal agreement requires amendments subject to unanimity.  My intuition is that there probably won't be any because the Commission knows that it is unlikely to get the requisite unanimity at Council.  If Ireland doesn't veto it, Spain probably will.  Etc.

Even if there were, exercising that veto would produce the very thing Ireland *says* it doesn't want — and Irish farmers will not thank their politicians for deliberately acting to damage one of their principal export markets.

Title: **Inheritance from out of country**

Original Post: 

&gt; Hello. 
&gt; 
&gt; Hopefully I’m posting in the right sub, please let me know otherwise!
&gt; 
&gt; So I have this friend from Europe (won’t be too specific for obvious reasons) who  lives in America. He recently lost his last living relative from this European country and had to go back for funeral and arrangements. Now this relative’s property was left to him as part of the will and he is planning to sell it as he doesn’t travel back a lot and it’s too much work to keep up from so far away. The house, if it sells, would get him about 50-60k in US $. He’s been worried about how that will transfer over here when the time comes and is worried if it’ll be taxed etc. as he doesn’t make that much money and this would help take off the load with some things. I’ve been trying to help him find answers but there’s a lot of mixed things on the internet as usual. He doesn’t know reddit so I’m posting for him in hopes someone here would know or has some sources to read further in this.
&gt; 
&gt; Basically, will he be taxed when he sells his inheritance/property and transfers the money to the USA? It’s not a business income, it’s family property/inheritance.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance.

But I can see you want to focus on black people, so I guess you are ok with people from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia then? Nice to know you are only partially racist!

&gt; The UK doesn't have any significant number of hispanics anyway, and we can see that since they aren't hidden inside any other group in the statistics.

Dude, we are near Spain so we have lots of people with Spanish heritage. The term Hispanic as used in the USA is a total fiction that no one else uses. You guys can't even agree on a definition. Does it include Brazil or not, as an example. 

&gt; Nope, it's a huge difference. You fucked it up.

Not really, you couldn't even quote the right figures. Plus I didn't realise you were weirdly specific in your racism, I thought you hated anyone coloured or muslim. It seems you are ok with everyone except blacks. That right yeah? You love Muslims from Pakistan?


&gt; No, it is not racist. If I lie, it makes me a liar, not a racist.

If you lie to support a cause, you support that cause.

&gt; You do know Black people are from SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA, right? North Africans are muslims like libyans and egyptians and shit. Nobody calls those people black.

But let's look at what you really mean. You mean really dark people. The really blacks ones that frighten and disgust you for reasons you can't really explain. I mean, you are trying here and failing miserably.

&gt; Is Europe next to sub-saharan africa? NOPE.

Why don't you look at the nationalities of people crossing the Mediterranean? Sorry wait, I mean why don't you look at the *colour* of people crossing. I can wait.

&gt; Is Europe even ""next to"" Africa? NOPE. The fucking Mediterranean sea is in the way. America wouldn't have shit tons of illegals from Mexico if the ocean was in between us.

It is less than 8 miles from Europe to Africa by sea and of course Turkey connects it via land. People make the crossing every single day.

&gt; You didn't show shit, amateur. You cited some numbers that did not have any relevance to the topic at hand at all. 

Heh, you posted the wrong figures - see my link. Also, your entire claim is that black people are more violent than white people. So facts showing you are full of shit are more than relevant to the discussion. Malawi, which is as sub-Saharan and black as your racist heart desires, is less violent than the US *even if you excluded every black murder in the US*.

&gt; I demolished your garbage comment. 

If that helps a racist sleep, you keep thinking that. A sleeping racist isn't an active racist :)

Not sure if serious, but yes. Much more than 20%. China has seen untold numbers lifted out of poverty. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates global undernourishment has roughly halved in the last 25 years (see https://ourworldindata.org/hunger-and-undernourishment).

This unfortunately isn't that helpful if you're working class in a developed country; standards of living have arguably slid.

Digression aside, though, removing capitalism doesn't automatically lead to utopia - we survived thousands of years with feudalism and merchantilism and those were flatly worse. Some of what you're blaming on capitalism (e.g. bureaucracy in universities) is a result of large organisations, and is often much worse in a state-run system simply because the organisations are larger.

More dangerously yet, when the state runs everything, everything is political. Would you feel comfortable with the NSA running Google? It could be worse than that: Lysenkoism is blamed for famines that killed millions.

I'm in Scotland. Healthcare is free here. Medicine is free here. University is free here. I find your American politics scarily frothingly right-wing. Throwing away capitalism entirely though is madness; it seems every country that tries it becomes a dictatorship within a short space of time. You don't get progressive social democracy that way, you get authoritarianism - likely precisely because you are creating an ultimate monopoly of power in the hands of a few politicians and trusting them to use it responsibly.

I fully agree however that wealth distribution is currently all kinds of fucked up and that ""helicopter money"" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter_money) is one potentially viable means of rebalancing. Many economists who have backed it are renowned, serious figures. More than that, if you're in the US, you should seriously be investing more public money in your infrastructure, a lot of it is close to third world. But please, realise how toxic your local politics are, and don't conclude that your current implementation of capitalism is the only one and you must fight Capitalism; there are better regulated, more heavily taxed European models that would plausibly serve you far better. It's easier to find a viably non-authoritarian approach that way, moving toward other existing working solutions, and the change required is less violent.",True,False,False,,0,1535900331,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e59o381,False,t3_9c9ssh,True,t1_e59lsu8,/r/changemyview/comments/9c9ssh/cmv_the_number_1_political_issue_in_the_world/e59o381/,,1538588241,8,True,False,changemyview,t5_2w2s8,r/changemyview,public,,

DIfference in watts: 104W - 130 vs 234

That's almost double the power.

More power means more heat, more heat means more noise in order to attain lower temperatures.

Higher fan speed, also, isn't just higher noise: it's also lower longevity for the GPU fans. More dust.

More power means less overclock.

Also, it's 4$ a month if you play only 4 hrs a day, and please mind that electricity cost are very high even in Europe. 4$ a month is 50$ per year.

Fair enough.

Where things go wrong imo is when a subsidized news channel does this too, either way it is pretty nasty.

&gt;We have no socialist or democratic socialist countries in Europe, the furthest left is probably the Nordic countries who are all social democracies


Whatever label you like to slap on it, as a libertarian I consider a lot to be left wing thought which most of Europe is but this is not all that relevant, I think we can agree on this.

&gt;Again i have to disagree, i personally am very against all organized religion BUT i´m especially against Islam and i have never been ""shouted down"" for being a racist,

Thats why I used a specific politician in our country as an example, the guy never said anything that is remotely racist yet a lot of other parties tried to frame him for being so after a part member spoke about IQ in a completely unrelated case, same goes for our media. The leftier the party the louder the cries, at least in this specific case.
My point was that these dogmas cannot be discussed with any decency, this even applies to elected politicians which I find hard to accept.

&gt;absolutely that happens but i think that will happen with almost any heavily controversial issue and it isn´t just ""the left"" doing this or ""islamist"" it´s everyone everywhere again maybe these groups are worse

Certainly , of course controversial issues raise a lot of emotions which will lead many to run around screaming instead. However I think that the left is over represented in 'moral outrage', perhaps the left is over represented in general, at least where I live so this could be a logical extension.
Another point is that since they dominate the landscape they should be held responsible for the consequences that this mass immigration has brought, perhaps we have a different scope.
 
&gt;so i think it´s a nuanced issue and just a product of the modern world where everyone feels especially victimized

&gt; WARSAW - Poland belongs in the European Union but should be careful not to be &amp;quot;Infected by social diseases&amp;quot; that dominate the bloc, ruling Law and Justice party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski said on Sunday.

&gt; While underlining the need for Poland to remain inside the bloc, his party says the EU is forcing member states to conform to standards that contravene Poland&amp;#039;s traditional family values.

&gt; On Sunday, Kaczynski said EU membership was &amp;quot;The shortest way for Poland to achieve parity when it comes to living standards&amp;quot; with its western allies.

A relatively new scheme targeting businesses and credit card owners is “reshipping fraud.” Criminals operating primarily from Eastern European countries and Nigeria have been conducting widespread, international schemes involving bogus job offers, fraudulent credit card orders, and the reshipping of illegally obtained products.

The scam begins when criminals buy high-dollar merchandise — such as computers, cameras, and other electronics — via the Internet using stolen credit cards. They have the merchandise shipped to addresses in the United States of paid “reshippers” (who may be unaware they are handling stolen goods). The reshippers repackage the merchandise and mail it to locations in Russia, Ukraine, Estonia, Lithuania, Romania, and Germany. Victimized businesses include such well-known companies as Amazon, Gateway, and eBay, and other Internet auction sites.

U.S. Postal Inspectors offer these tips:

* Don’t give out personal information to a person or company you don’t know.
* Be suspicious of any offer that doesn’t pay a regular salary or involves working for an overseas company.
* Check the company with the FTC, Better Business Bureau, or state Attorney General.

Podem jogar uma valente merda mas enquando conseguirem caminhar são titulares.

e mais do que a preocupação de termos jogadores cansados e lesionados, há também o facto de jogando sempre os mesmos, semana sim semana sim, os outros pura e simplesmente não se conseguem adaptar, nem ganhar ritmo de jogo. Temos 7 jogos em mais ou menos 3 semanas e para aí 15 jogadores de 31 com minutos, \~13 que estiveram no XI inicial, e uns 7 que jogaram os 90 minutos em todos os jogos, e uma carrada de jogadores a ver jogar, depois há substituições forçadas, entra alguem que passa a epoca na bancada não tem ritmo de jogo e depois é ver os ""fãs"" 'ah não tem qualidade, por mim era vendido por 15M€ ao Nottingham"".

mas não é continuar, nem sei porque houve muito alarido na época passada por falta de jogadores e opções, correu tão bem. tanta coisa foi dita do plantel mas pelos vistos 15 chegam, 11 para jogar e 4 avançados no banco.

nem sei porque é que há tantas equipas a preocuparem-se com rotação de jogadores, é só olharem para o RV, ele é um génio. Isto é tal e qual como daquela vez que quiseste fazer passar o RV por revolucionário por só chamar um central e de não precisar de levar laterais, ""ah mas o Guardiola também faz"" e depois foi-se a ver e não era verdade.

Enfim... É o RV a bater com a cabeça na parede todos os jogos e tu a dares os parabéns á genialidade dele, não sei quem é pior. Depois não se queixem, não há motivo nenhum para rodar jogadores, como sabemos o aprendiz do RV, o Sr.Guardiola nem gasta muito dinheiro com reforços para o banco, ele joga sem com os mesmo XI e nem faz substituições. Acho que devíamos fazer o mesmo, poupasse em salarios e escusasse até de ter 30 jogadores emprestados.

​e:

e um ""pequeno"" detalhe, talvez queiras enviar o artigo ao teu amigo, não para ele começar a rodar a equipa ou fazê-lo ainda menos. só mesmo porque ele já começou a preparar as desculpas para um possível falhanço:

""Tem sido de uma intensidade enorme. Tenho de dar os parabéns aos jogadores pela entrega ao jogo. Não temos quase tempo de descanso. Gostava de ter menos jogos, mas é isto que temos. Perante este adversário não se notou em termos de intensidade. De uma forma mais fresca e tendo mais descanso, este jogo era nosso"".

&gt;Não temos quase tempo de descanso

Mas afinal há ou não há cansaço? E vindo do treinador que é o unico responsável em rodar a equipa, e que não o faz porque não o quer, vir chorar depois dos jogos que os jogadores fazem muitos jogos em pouco tempo quando tem metade do plantel parado...

E as desculpas do ano passado não pegam, este ano a direção foi buscar alternativas, e foi buscá-las cedo no Verão. Não há alternativas porque o treinador não quer.

This suggests that you're deeply offended by the notion, which indicates that, if nothing else, you're as ideological as the people you despise. My jimmies, however, remain unrustled.

Your first paragraph is a *gross* oversimplification of the political paradigm - *liberalism* can refer to a lot of different things, in a lot of different contexts. Progressives are liberal in the contemporary American sense, and anarcho-capitalists are liberal in the economic sense. However, progressives and anarcho-capitalists are mutually opposed in their viewpoints. This is why your comment about conservatism is overly simplistic, as it doesn't recognize any particular context. It's a low-resolution model, which is a point I've been trying to put forward for the last two days.

You have some real gems in that second paragraph, but I'll be civil and not do line-by-line responses. Instead, I'll point out that this is the most historically ignorant view of European nationalism in the 20th century that I've seen in a while. They were absolutely trying to conserve something - national pride and image. One thing they don't teach you young whippersnappers these days is the relationship between European nationalism and the looming threat of communism in the 1930s, nor do they teach about the Spanish Civil War, or the long-standing consequences of World War One or any of the important history which defines what the world looks like today.

And no, the definition of left-wing isn't ""big government"". The difference between left and right wing politics is a difference of temperament with respect to conscientiousness and openness. You don't understand this, and I understand that the only frame of reference you have is contemporary American politics. *But* - and this is a big *but* - if you invest some time reading about 20th century history, you will find that there's not a single thing I've said that is incorrect.

I'm arguing in the interest of truth, and this seems to be considered *bad faith* to right-wing ideologues.

In any case, defensive warfare is almost always deeply important, and you've gone from a battle that was 4:1 odds to somewhere between 2:1 to 4:3, not exactly overwhelming numbers on the high end for a defensive engagement along with the fact that the Christians had the Knights Hospilire on their side, who were probably the single most professional military force in European History post the fall of Rome, but were rather small.

It spread pretty widely in germania. arian bishop ulfilas christianized the east-germanic speaking goths, who then dissemenated it as they came south establishing their kingdoms in places like spain and italy. 

&gt;Are there any Arians left today?

The original arians died out over time during history, especially after the franks converted to catholicism and conquered most of germanic europe. Visigothic spain was conquered by islam, and then reconquered by catholics. 

So the historical arians? no, they died out. 

However, a few restorationist protestant groups hold beliefs similar to the historical arians in their christology (although that's where the similarties end -- the historical arians still had ""catholic-like"" liturgical praxis; neo-arians are mostly low-church).

She seems to be changing her tune due to the fact that AfD look set to take the next elections but Merkel was queen SJW for ages. Almost single handedly caused the migrant crisis.

&gt;Sorry im not going to watch a 15 minute video to make your argument for you

Why am I not surprised. A quick and informative video by one of the few remaining unbiased newspeople. Facts dont support your ideology so you need to ignore it. I get it man I do.

&gt;More importantly he was Irish by law the day he was born

I did mention that he was. I wouldnt call it important or more important than any of the rest even. It just is what it is.

&gt;DO you see any SJW countries? Because I see plenty of despotic right wing countries

Yeah there are a lot of those in the middle east and asia. The SJW ones would be mainly the Nordic countries and Germany which are slowly starting to fall apart. France was on track for that too but it seems the granny lover president of theirs actually has something resembling a spine. Still somewhat SJWish but not as bad as people expected. May in the UK keeps pandering to them when she can though nowhere near as much as Comrade Corbyn and his communist wing of the Labour party and sadly for them he may get the top spot next time around. In that case Brexit will be used as the excuse for the death of their economy but it will be his socialist policies assuming he implements what he seems to want to.

&gt;Thats not what centrism is, try again

Really. Enlighten me then. What is ""True"" centrism.

&gt;Thats not what liberalism is, try again

Part of Liberalism is protecting the people. You protect the rights of the people which includes protecting their lives and property by restricting who can enter the nation. You clearly dont have a clue about what classical liberal principles are.

&gt;If youre against immigration you are arguing against liberalism and capitalism.

Again Im not against immigration Im against open borders. You can restrict immigration and still allow immigration. Its not an all or nothing thing you know.

&gt; Youre arguing in favor of limiting peoples freedoms

The states first priority is the defense of the nation and its people and that includes immigration policy. People external to the nation state are at best a secondary consideration. The state has no obligation to allow anyone and everyone in as it can harm the people already in the nation.

&gt;youre anti capitalist by limiting capitals ability to use labour. 

Capitalism can work without immigration and has done for a long ass time before it reached the ridiculous levels we have now. Capitalism only likes mass immigration because an influx of unskilled workers drives down wages which is probably great for those coming in who would be making a lot more than they were in their home country but terrible for everyone already here as they lose out on employment opportunities and when they do find work their wages are shit.

&gt;And if youre only against open borders then youre in luck, because only Svalbard has open borders

Funny the EU until recently seemed to have pretty open borders with the millions of people being invited in. And lets not forget the calls for open borders by the SJW types including yourself since youve been arguing for it in this discussion.

I see your link. Heres another one - https://www.dw.com/en/german-study-links-increased-crime-rate-to-migrant-arrivals/a-42006484

Dont worry they blame it all on the media and claim the crime rate is actually lower even though that first one showed its increased - https://www.dw.com/en/germany-crime-rate-drops-but-fear-rises/a-43692277

Interesting. Almost looks like their stats are bullshit and things are being underreported so as to appear good. Might have had to do with Trump saying German crime rates were skyrocketing then they wanted to defend against that accusation. Hell the new years attacks alone way overshadowed the few antifa scuffles during G20.

&gt;Yes because clearly Nazis stopped being bad after the war

A backer pasted this update from slack two days ago as a kickstarter comment:

Hi guys, just want to jump in to give a quick update. The team still rushing to complete the firmware update in next few days so backers who is receiving the US WH shipments will get to update their units when their superbook arrives.

1) Our Gilroy warehouse logistical provider has confirmed they recieve the containers with the superbook and accessories (including chargers) on Tuesday evening, and is preparing them for shipment. They havn't provided us with the schedule for shipment yet, we are pushing for them to start the shipment to end backer by the weekend/early next week if possible. They usually schedule their shipment team a few day/one week in advance so they can prepare the shipment paperworks and logistical material, we are pushing them to slot us in as soon as possible. Will provide more update when we get the exact date for start of shipment

2) The shipment for the finished APAC units from our manufacturer in china to HK is schedule for tonight (night time in US day time in china). We will provide update for next step once the superbook has cleared customs.

3) EU units still on route, no update there until the ship arrive at Neitherland boarder.
