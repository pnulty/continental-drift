This results in a price rise as there is less material to go round meaning local people's livelihoods are not affected.
 Here's a case study: in Nigeria many people were in severe poverty and would strip the rubber tree of all it's bark to sell to Europe for a low price, resulting in the death of the tree. The massive number of people relying on the forest led to the near extinction of the tree. Conservationists went ""hang on a second"" and through a fairly cheap but time consuming scheme have started policing the forest, marking parts of trees for removal etc. They then also negotiate with the EU to get a fair price, meaning the locals are better off than before with a stable and sustainable livelihood and they are still able to use the forest (source: my GCSE geography teacher, I'll dig out the exact link if you *really* want it but I'll need to ask him first, and that won't happen till next week). Anyway, conservation of the forests could work in the exact same way. Volunteers and others head to areas that need conserving, police the area and arrange better deals as the people will be producing less.

Even after a headshot, the beast may continue to lumber forward in pursuit of the player’s brains. The British economy has behaved in a similar fashion since the Brexit referendum of 2016. Many pundits had predicted that the uncertainty caused by the vote to leave would send Britain into recession, with unemployment shooting up and wages collapsing. But the economy has plodded on. That will work to the advantage of the incumbent Conservative Party at the election on December 12th.

Smoothing through quarterly data, since the referendum the economy has grown at a quarterly rate of about 0.4% (1.5% on an annualised basis). That is far from impressive by historical standards. Surprisingly enough, however, it is about as fast as the average growth rate across the G7 over the period; President Donald Trump’s trade war has dented global economic growth. And Britain’s labour market has strengthened. The unemployment rate has continued to decline, and now sits around a four-decade low of under 4%. The share of GDP accruing to workers in the form of wages, salaries and employment-related benefits is edging up.

Two main factors are responsible for this slow but steady performance. For much of the post-referendum period consumers have been doggedly upbeat. Analysis last year from economists at the Bank of England suggested that, since the referendum, spending by Leave voters had grown more quickly than that of Remainers. The tight labour market has supported consumption spending. So has borrowing. Since the referendum, credit-card debt has grown by about 8% a year, a high rate by post-crisis standards. In early 2017 households’ savings ratio (ie, the share of their disposable income which they were setting aside) fell to its lowest level since 1963.

In recent months growth in consumption spending has slowed—perhaps households became nervous as Brexit day appeared to be just around the corner. Yet another source of demand has taken its place. Breaking from its deserved reputation for fiscal austerity, the Conservative government has turned on the spending taps. A spending review in September promised £13bn ($16.7bn, or 0.6% of GDP) of extra funding for public services and investment. In July doctors and dentists got an above-inflation pay rise. A four-year cash-terms freeze on most working-age benefits will end in April. The budget deficit (ie, the difference between tax receipts and government spending) is once again increasing, having been on a downward path since 2010.


The rise in living standards comes at a useful time for Boris Johnson, the prime minister. In Britain’s three most recent general elections, incumbents did well when real wages were rising smartly, and badly when they were not [(see chart)](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/640-width/images/print-edition/20191102_BRC064.png). With hindsight, it is clear that Theresa May picked pretty much the worst possible time to go to the polls: in June 2017, the month her snap election was held, real wages fell by 0.5%, largely the result of higher consumer-price inflation caused by the depreciation of the pound. This time, by contrast, Labour’s contention that the British economy needs a complete overhaul may seem less compelling.

I will feast on your Keynes

Like a wounded zombie, however, the British economy has not escaped unscathed. One paper from academics at Cambridge University suggests that uncertainty over trade policy has dented export prospects. Fearful of future tariffs on exports, many firms have pulled back from supplying foreign markets. That in part explains why, despite the fall in the value of the pound, which should make Britain’s wares more competitive in foreign markets, there is little sign of an export boom. Meanwhile, recent research from Nick Bloom of Stanford University, and colleagues, suggests that Brexit-related uncertainty has held back business investment—which, in real terms, is no higher than it was at the time of the referendum.

Low levels of capital spending by firms will weigh on Britain’s productivity, which already has barely grown in the past decade. That will hold back increases in real wages. And the drag from Brexit will become much more noticeable when it actually happens. Over the long run Mr Johnson’s Brexit deal would reduce incomes by about 6% compared with what they would otherwise have been—only a marginally better outcome than the estimated cost of leaving the EU with no deal at all. The paradox of the forthcoming election is that the prime minister is likely to reap the rewards of an unexpectedly strong economy, even as he promises to hobble it.",True,False,False,,,0,1572568795,,False,0,{},f5z6w89,True,t3_dpwuuv,True,True,t3_dpwuuv,/r/ukpolitics/comments/dpwuuv/britains_economy_is_holding_up_wellfor_now_real/f5z6w89/,False,,1580513049,3,True,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,r/ukpolitics,public,0,

The border is a complicated issue. Turkey can't secure its Southern borders even when it tries, which is one of the main reasons PKK insurgency can't be finished militarily. There is also the aspect of self preservation in letting militants cross the Syrian border so they are out of Turkey. The border itself is open to civilians and many of ISIS recruits don't have a criminal record, they enter Turkey from Europe with legal visas, so legally impossible to stop from going to Syria. Also arming FSA was illegal itself, so the weapon shipments weren't all directly made by the state, especially after the MIT scandal. Highly likely some of those ended in ISIS hand because they happened to be the highest bidder.

There was no SDF then, it was directly YPG who controlled the border before ISIS. Turkey's main policy was toppling Assad, back then they didn't really care about YPG. Turkey even negotiated with YPG in 2014 when Salih Muslim came to Ankara and promised support against ISIS if they joined the rebels against the regime.

He wouldn't even comment on the 'unfortunate incident' when previously he held a fucking national new conference when a muslim girl might have had her hijab cut with scissors 😱WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE A FUCKING HOAX, and again silence from our globalist prime minister.

I think you're also missing a massive point, Canadians were never asked if we wanted to take in hundreds of thousands of migrants, and neither were any of the other countries that have had this happen to them, SIMULTANEOUSLY against their will, under the guise of human rights and diversity is strength propaganda.

If you're against mass migration that will eventually replace your entire population, you're deemed a racist nazi bigot, yet NOBODY WAS EVER AGAINST NORMAL 1800's - 1990's migration, or normal levels of diversity..

In the UK, some former 99% English towns are now 99% muslim towns with no go zones, which means police, fire and ambulance services will not go into specific zones for fear of their lives. This is happening in Germany, Sweden and other European countries, so save your television programmed virtue signaling bullshit...

Nobody is saying that ALL migrants are rapists, only you and the Orwellian television are implying that's what people are thinking if they are enraged that a baby girl being tortured, raped and murdered could happen..

FOR THE SAME REASON YOU DON'T VACATION WITH YOUR FUCKING FAMILY IN SOMALIA OR SYRIA, IS THE VERY SAME FUCKING REASON NORMAL CANADIANS ARE RIGHTFULLY CONCERNED ABOUT MASS MIGRATION FROM THESE COUNTRIES.. 😶

Pardon by French and my screaming in caps, but enough is enough.. This kind of virtue signaling and implying that normal, caring people are racists or hateful because they don't want to flood the country they love with people from the 3rd world is fucking abhorrent..

About 3 BILLON people want to migrate to western nations.. Should we just take them all in? Can we trust the selfish, war obsessed ruling class that can't even fix poverty or homelessness in our own countries, to care for the millions of migrants they are using as pawns to consolidate their own power? NO...., WE CAN'T..., so stop with your bullshit and use your brain.

And for fucks sakes turn off your television programming and find some news sources outside of the corporate msm. Use the fucking Internet and listen to what real everyday people are saying is happening in their own countries.. Stop shaming them whilst parroting what the television has programmed into your mind.. 

The CBC forecasts Canada will be a migrant majority country of around 150 million people by 2050-2060 and we can't even take care of our own impoverished people.. HOW THE LIVING FUCK ARE YOU OK WITH THIS? 

Ask yourself a deep question and don't answer it until you've thought about it for weeks.. 

WHY WOULD OUR RULING CLASS WANT TO TURN OUR COUNTRY INTO A MIGRANT MAJORITY COUNTRY? what could they gain from such radical demographic change?

OK.  You want evidence.  Here you go.  
Let me help you out with this.  For all of you watching at home, here are your thanksgiving talking points.



# Crime #1: Trump asked a foreign leader to investigate a political opponent, which is illegal.   

We know this because it's in the transcripts of the call Trump made on July 25th, which Trump released.  It is a criminal campaign finance violation. **[52 USC 30121: Contributions and donations by foreign nationals](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=\(title:52%20section:30121%20edition:prelim\))**  

10/7 update: reporter ""But did Trump ever ask someone who is not a political rival to be investigated?""  Even, say, his own diplomat, a former hotelier who gave the Trump Inauguration Fund $1m


&gt; ""oh he was just helping the Justice Department investigate corruption. Biden's son snorted cocaine, but then was hired to be on a Board of Directors!""  

But there is no Justice Department investigation on the Bidens.  There is no evidence that the Bidens did anything wrong and the Ukraine AG said so. Aand please don't talk to me about how H. Biden had no experience in oil and gas therefore this is corrupt... look at the board of any major company then.  The Justice Department confirmed that Russia, not Ukraine, hacked DNC servers. The Republican Controlled Senate confirmed it was Russia, not Ukraine, that hacked the DNC servers.



Most importantly, Presidents doesn't do investigation work or involve himself in investigations.    Especially investigations that don't exist. And the President never started any public corruption investigation against anyone who is not a political rival.


# Crime #2: Trump asked for help from a foreign leader in order to get that leader's aid in smearing Trump's political opponent.  This is quid pro quo and is illegal.  

This is also in the transcript.  ""We need you to do us a favor **though...**""  It is backed up by Trump actually holding up aid on July 19th.  The motivation for this was attested for directly by multiple Trump appointees, including Sonderland and Taylor, and third-person accounts.


10/7 update: [And Trump's own people and the Ukrainians thought this was a quid pro quo and said so in text messages.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/04/us/politics/ukraine-text-messages-volker.html)  

10/17 update: In the [opening](https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000016d-d9ee-db16-a1ed-fdef60680001) statement, Trump's Ambassador to the EU, Sondland stated he was directed to tell Ukraine that their meeting with Trump was dependent on investigating Biden. He was directed to do this by Guiliani, who was working on Trump's orders, not orders from the State Department or Department of Justice.

10/18 update: [Mulvany verified](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50087392) that a threat was made in withholding military funds; the quo of quid pro quo .  Now we are expected to believe that the quid part was merely Trump investigating corruption.  [While it was announced the next G7 will be at Trump's hotel.](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/dj9phr/megathread_trump_has_awarded_next_years_g7_summit/)

10/23 update: US diplomat confirmed in opening statement to Congress that Sondland [reported that Trump's order was that if there is no public statement of investigation into Biden investigation there would not be military aid.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/u-s-diplomat-bill-taylor-who-called-trump-s-ukraine-n1069941)

10/27 update: just to make clear (because some people are saying ""oh that's just a transaction""), quid pro quo is not a crime, just like ""collusion"" is not a crime. [But bribery is a crime, just like conspiracy is.](https://www.businessinsider.com/laws-trump-could-have-broken-ukraine-whistleblower-case-2019-9)

11/1 update: [Tim Morrison confirmed quid pro quo in testimony](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/10/31/tim-morrison-just-confirmed-quid-pro-quo-thats-big-story-here/).  Testimony given day after he quit the WH.

&gt; J. Biden bragged about getting the Ukrainian prosecutor fired.  Biden was doing the same thing Trump has done.

Ah.  The old ""he did something bad so I can do anything bad otherwise God is a hypocrite argument"".

Yes. [ And the IMF and most of the EU were calling for the prosecutor to be fired too.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Shokin)  Because that was a corrupt prosecutor - who didn't actually investigate the gas company H. Biden worked for - in one of the most corrupt nations on Earth. Whom Trump said in the transcript was treated unfairly.


&gt;""But the Ukrainians didn't know that Trump stopped the weapons aid on July 19th.""  

&gt; ""But Ukraine's President said there was not quid pro quo.""

(10/23 updated: These above talking points are older and it since has come out that Ukrainians knew in the beginning of August. But I'm keeping it in here anyway.)

So?  Trump made the demand and he seemed to be following through with it whether or not Ukraine knew, and whether or not Ukraine said it happened or didn't happen.

&gt; But Sondland said there was no quid pro quo

Sondland testified Trump told him there is no quid pro quo. In other words, Sondland testified that Trump said ""I'm innocent. There is no quid pro quo.  But I need this thing which happens to be quid pro quo.""

Update: 10/27.  [Actually Sondland told Congressional investigators that yes, actually, he does think it's quid pro quo
](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/467607-sondland-told-house-there-was-a-ukraine-quid-pro-quo-report?amp&amp;__twitter_impression=true)

# Crime #3: Extensive efforts were made to hide this quid quo pro. That's obstruction and is illegal. 

We know this from the whistle-blower's report that the original meeting transcript was put onto a higher-level server meant for military secrets. Director of National Intelligence Acting Director confirmed this in his remarks to Congress. 

10/18 update:[ Ordering people not to comply with subpoenas is actually illegal and impeachable.](https://qz.com/1726880/trump-officials-who-disobey-subpoenas-risk-jail-fines-and-more/) 

11/1 Update: [Vindman says White House omitted Trump's reference to Biden tapes in transcript of Zelensky call](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/30/politics/alexander-vindman-testimony-white-house-transcript/index.html?no-st=1572492771), showing evidence of understanding of guilt.


&gt; the whisteblower reported hearsay.  

But the Director of National Intelligence Inspector General and acting Director- both of whom Trump appointed - confirmed this.  

# Crime #4: Trump and all of his people, including Pompeo, including Trump's lawyers, all knew what happened. That's called conspiracy and is a crime.

They worked to put the transcripts on the top secret server. 

10/3 Update: Additionally, Pompeo's attempted deception through omission is evidence of knowledge of guilt. Denying State Department employees testify to Congress just added to obstruction charges.

10/18 Update: Furthermore, National Security Advisor Bolton [knew that what Guiliani was doing was illegal](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/14/us/politics/bolton-giuliani-fiona-hill-testimony.html) and talked to lawyers about it on July 10th.  The illegality of this project started before the aid was held up, before the phone call.


# Crime #5: Someone in Justice and/or State and / or the White House specifically told the Director of National Intelligence  Acting Director to not give the whistleblower complaint to Congress.  This violates the laws governing the role of the NSA.

# Crime #6: Trump ordered State Department to hold up funds to Ukraine.  Neither Trump, nor the State Department, has the right to withhold funds Congress has allocated.  This is a violation of Article 1 of the Constitution.

And actually, as Trump didn't have the right to hold up this money, and he used it for his own political gains without interest of the country, it's [possibly misappropriation, which is a sub-set of embezzlement.](https://www.businessinsider.com/laws-trump-could-have-broken-ukraine-whistleblower-case-2019-9)

Other than that, I don't think any other ethnic group was singled out except for the Irish but bram was Protestant so probably spared that plus he was part of high society much like his friend Oscar Wilde(before his fall from grace).

As for Romanians, there was a large population of Romany Gypsies but they're not the same as Romanians, they're a separate ethnic group in themselves. They got along well enough with Cockney Londoners that they shared language with one another, cushty being a particularly common London word with Gypsey origins. London back then seems to have been a very cosmopolitan place with enough work to go around for everyone so as not to cause any huge resentments.

However, it seems that the Romanians need not have traveled to London at all and bad attitudes my have been brought home from those who traveled there:

""Ever since British (or mainly English) travellers began exploring the Carpathians from the 1860s onwards, Romanians and Romanian society have posed an intriguing conundrum to British onlookers. The Romanian lands offered an escape from urban and industrial Britain. Travellers such as Mary Adelaide Walker in 1888 admired the tranquillity of the rural monasteries in Northern Moldova. At the same time, a growing sense of foreboding and loathing took hold of British imaginings of what is now Romania. Transylvania, of course, was at this point part of the Hungarian Kingdom within the Habsburg Empire. Nonetheless, it was encounters with the majority population of Romanians, and not with Hungarians, Jews, or Germans / Saxons, that gave these travels and their reports an exotic and dark twist. Hungarians were often depicted as noblemen while Saxons were admired for their austere Protestant appearances. By contrast, Wallach or Romanian peasants were exotic and untrustworthy.""

On the other hand:

""The 19th Century represents an important moment in the evolution of our bilateral relations. In January 1803 the UK established in Bucharest its first official Diplomatic Mission, the British Consulate in Wallachia, and in March 1814 a second British Consulate was created in Moldova. Romania and the United Kingdom signed the first modern bilateral Treaty of Trade and Navigation in 1880 and at the beginning of their diplomatic relations the two countries were also closely linked through their Royal families, Queen Maria of Romania being British by birth and grand daughter of Queen Victoria. At the start of the First World War, Queen Maria strongly advocated entering the war on the British camp and 800,000 Romanian soldiers fought on the Entente side, with more than 335,000 of them making the ultimate sacrifice - 6% of all Military deaths in WW I.""

For example, Gas Vans, which would fill the compartment with engine exhaust over the trip. This way the victims wouldn't panic initially. The Becker-Rauf Letter details this. Its the second link in my comment. The word ""Abschiebung"" or deportation is the word used in the Wannsee Conference documents in lieu of extermination. In 1942 there was not a single country on Earth that would accept the mass deportation off undesirables from Nazi Germany. This pretext of deportation was used to throw people off from the true nature of the operation. This kind of language likely also made it easier for the Nazis to justify their actions. A form of cognitive dissonance.

Here are some interesting quotes from the links I posted

\&gt;*Greater protection is needed for the lighting system. The grille should cover the lamps high enough up to make it impossible to break the bulb. It seems these lamps are hardly ever turned on, so the users have suggested that they can be done away with. Experience shows, however, that when the back door is closed and it gets dark inside, the load pushes hard against the door. The reason for this is that when it becomes dark inside the load rushes toward what little light is left*

This is from the Becker-Rauf letter. Why would the ""load"" on this truck push towards the door when it becomes dark inside? Because the ""load"" is scared. Because the ""load"" is people.

\&gt; *The pipe that connects the exhaust to the van tends to rust, because it is eaten away from the inside by liquids that flow into it. To avoid this, the nozzle should be so arranged as to point downward. The liquids will thus be prevented from flowing into the pipe.*

So this is detailing how there is a pipe connecting the exhaust into the van, as well as talking about ""liquids"" being prevented from entering the pipe. These liquids are likely vomit and urine, side effects of Carbon Monoxide poisoning.

The amount of Jews (and other peoples like my Great Aunt) that were missing from Europe was staggering. In Poland for example, 10% of the population was jewish before the war. After the war, close to 0%. No they didn't teleport to Palestine in 1945.

Edit: Evidence [https://web.archive.org/web/20150623213741/http://www.igipz.pan.pl/en/zpz/Political\_migrations.pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20150623213741/http://www.igipz.pan.pl/en/zpz/Political_migrations.pdf)

The Nazis did not decide to kill the Jews until 1942, at the Wannsee Conference, so at that point many of the Jewish people were already in camps. What other way would you kill millions of people? Certainly not bullets. Waste of ammunition, and likely to result in uprisings. You boil a frog slowly. The efficiency of the Holocaust is a grim testament of German Ingenuity. Most of the time people did not suspect their deaths until it was too late. If people knew that they were 100% going to die, then you would have serious problems controlling them. Gives them hope, and they'll keep their heads down.

It's not exaggeration, its history. There was a grand conspiracy to kill them all. It was imbedded in the Nazi Ideology. Aryans before subhumans. They spent resources during a total war killing them because they viewed the Jews and the undesirables as the enemy. The Holocaust, in their mind was vital to the war effort.

I appreciate you actually discussing this instead of screeching like that other guy, but that doesn't stop you from being wrong.

Edit: One more thing I'd like to mention is just how one sided this conversation has been when it comes to sources and evidence. I've readily supplied dozens of verifiable sources for my claims, but you are yet to cite one. Skepticism isn't proof of anything. Saying this like ""Well NOWHERE does this say the word ""We are Nazis and we want to kill all the Jews"" isn't proof of anything. The burden of proof is on your shoulders.

Description|Antoine-Augustin Parmentier loved potatoes. Antoine is remembered as a vocal promoter of the potato as a food source for humans in France and throughout Europe.  what makes him particularly interesting is at the time Antoine was alive the cultivation of potatoes was illegal in France.⤶During the Seven Years' War, Antoine was serving as an army pharmacist for France and was eventually captured by the Prussians. In Prussian prison was faced with eating potatoes, again, known to the French only as hog feed. ⤶The potato had been introduced from South America to Europe by the Spaniards at the beginning of the 16th century. It was introduced to the rest of Europe by 1640, but (outside Spain and Ireland) was usually used only for animal feed. In Prussia, where our boy Antoine is still in prison,  King Frederick II required peasants to cultivate the plants under severe penalties. The Prussian king even provided them with cuttings. In 1748 the French Parliament had actually forbidden the cultivation of the potato (on the grounds that it was thought to cause leprosy among other things), and this law remained on the books in Antoine's time, until with his help, would later be reversed. ⤶culinary ⤶Due largely to Parmentier's efforts, the Paris Faculty of Medicine declared potatoes edible in 1772. Still, resistance continued, and Antone was prevented from using his test garden at the hospital where he worked as a pharmacist. The group holding Antoine back was the religious community that owned the land. Their complaints resulted in the removal of Parmentier's position at the hospital.⤶after this Antoine's mission would not be derailed. he then began a series of publicity stunts for which he remains notable today. He hosted dinners at which potato dishes were featured prominently and guests included Benjamin Franklin. Antoine once gave bouquets of potato blossoms to the king and queen of france. One of my favorites is a story of him surrounding his potato patch with armed guards during the day to suggest valuable goods and would withdraw them at night so people could steal the potatoes. He instructed them to let anyone steal them anytime during the day, too, and to take any bribe big or small. ⤶⤶1771, Parmentier won an essay contest in which all the judges voted the potato as the best substitute for regular flour. This was before a time France needed a replacement for wheat, so Antoine continued to face criticism and lack of acknowledgment for his work. The first step in getting  French society to accept the potato was a year of bad harvests in 1785, when the scorned potatoes staved off famine in the north of France. ⤶In 1789, Parmentier published work on the Culture and Use of the Potato, Sweet Potato, and Jerusalem Artichoke, it was (quote) ""printed by order of the king"", giving royal backing to potato eating. the problem was this work was published the day before the start of the French Revolution. 5 years later potatoes would become accepted as ""food for the revolutionaries"" in 1795 massive plots of potatoes were grown to feed rebels as they fought against the French monarchy.⤶Parmentier's culinary interests covered a wide range of opportunities to help the current generation through technical improvements; he published his observations touching on bread-baking, cheese-making, grain storage, the use of cornmeal, chestnut flour, mushroom culture, mineral waters, wine-making, improved sea biscuits, and a host of other topics.⤶⤶In 1779, Parmentier was appointed to teach at the Free School of Bakery to help stabilize Paris' food supply by making bread in a more cost-efficient fashion. In that same year, he published a recipe in which he described how one can make potato bread that still has all the characteristics of wheat bread.⤶⤶His many other contributions to nutrition and health included establishing the first mandatory smallpox vaccination campaign. Antoine was appointed as  Inspector-General of Health Services by Napoleon, and would convince Napoleon to mandate the vaccine in 1805. He also perfected the process of the extracting sugar from beets. Parmentier founded a school of bread-making, and studied methods of conserving food, including refrigeration.⤶⤶ Any dish whose name includes the description ""Parmentier"" will contain potatoes as a major ingredient. The popular dish hachis Parmentier is very similar to cottage or shepherd's pie, consisting typically of a mixture of skinless mashed potato with finely ground meat. potage Parmentier, its a leek and potato soup, which has been puréed. ⤶⤶Parmentier died on December 13th 1813, at age 76. He is buried in Paris, in a plot ringed by potato plants,. He has a street named after him in paris and also a metro station. There are a couple of statues of Antoine in France...this one shows that him standing above a couple of grateful peasant while handing the  m seed potatoes. .

&gt; # [Las exportaciones de máquinas encienden luces verdes](https://maquinac.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Cosechadora-Dolbi-Javiyú-exportada-a-Sudán-1.jpg)
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt; Las exportaciones argentinas de **máquinas agrícolas** van ganando terreno tanto en mercados como en tipos de productos que se embarcan al exterior.
&gt; 
&gt; Si el repaso se hace desde los rubros tradicionales, hay que señalar a las **sembradoras** como uno de los segmentos más prometedores en la actual etapa.
&gt; 
&gt; Tanto destinos latinoamericanos como europeos se van agregando a la lista de clientes que requieren la tecnología argentina.
&gt; 
&gt; Con un agregado particular: **Europa** se perfila como un nicho de peso para colocar equipos específicos de siembra directa.
&gt; 
&gt; También entre los productos de mayor trayectoria exportadora se mantienen las **tolvas** y las **agropartes**, con perspectivas de abrir nuevos negocios.
&gt; 
&gt; #### Abanico
&gt; 
&gt; Entre los segmentos relativamente más nuevos en el comercio externo, se están anotando las **fertilizadoras** y las **pulverizadoras**.
&gt; 
&gt; También están los **cabezales**, como en el caso de [Piersanti](https://maquinac.com/empresas/piersanti/) que ha establecido una base en **Colombia** para insertar la plataforma arrocera.
&gt; 
&gt; Otro caso es el de [Roland H](https://maquinac.com/empresas/roland-h/) que está cubriendo cada vez más mercados latinoamericanos con las **motocortadoras**.
&gt; 
&gt; Asimismo, debe anotarse el posicionamiento de varias empresas en **Paraguay** para atender ese destino y para convertir al país en plataforma de expansión hacia nuevos horizontes.
&gt; 
&gt; #### “Transnacionales”
&gt;

Denmark: Multiparty 1858-1873, Two-Party 1873-1884, Multiparty 1884-1915. Implemented PR at that point.

Norway: Two-Party 1882-1888, Multiparty 1888-1903. Implemented TTR at that point.

Sweden: Two-Party 1866-1893, Multiparty 1893-1905. Implemented PR at that point.

&gt;Where they go from two factions in one election to 4+ (plus independents) in the next?

[Denmark, 1855](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1855_Danish_Folketing_election) to [Denmark 1858](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1855_Danish_Folketing_election).

&gt;Or from two factions in one election to three (plus two minor ones, plus independents) in the next to four (plus two minor ones, plus independents) in the next, all within a single a decade?

None in that specific pattern, but Denmark had a period where it went 2 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 6 starting in 1855. Norway had one where it went 2 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 3 -&gt;3 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 6. 

Fun fact, by the way: if you actually chart what percent of seats don't belong the two largest factions/parties in all these countries, including Greece, Denmark actually typically had more than Greece. Greece did beat out Sweden and Norway, though, since those two just went quickly to PR once their multiparty systems became entrenched. 

Also note: these were just the *European* contemporaries using FPTP in SMD's (other than the UK, which is boring except for the transition near WW1) that I could confirm actually used FPTP. On the other hand, many other European countries at the time were using variants upon two round systems; those consistently showed multiparty systems, and typically to a greater degree than Greece did both in terms of number of factions as well as seat share to parties other than the two largest parties; e.g. compare a good year like  [Greece 1899](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1899_Greek_legislative_election) with 6 factions/parties and ~40% of seats not top-two parties to the [Dutch 1913 elections, the last before PR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1913_Dutch_general_election) with 7 parties and ~55% of seats not top-two parties or the [1893 German elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1893_German_federal_election) with 14 parties and ~57% of seats not top-two parties. 

There are more examples of FPTP generating persistent multiparty systems later on in other countries (PNG springs to mind before their transition to IRV), and probably a few more contemporary European examples (but I can't get confirmation that they weren't using TTR or something similar, so they're excluded).",True,False,False,,,0,1572580618,,1572597277,0,{},f5zmixx,False,t3_dp6orh,False,True,t1_f5yv0lf,/r/EndFPTP/comments/dp6orh/any_opinion_polls_on_rankedchoice_voting_nyc/f5zmixx/,False,,1580520749,1,True,False,EndFPTP,t5_3fo0j,r/EndFPTP,public,0,

[],,mondorific,1378833137.0,,,[],,​,dark,text,t2_d3eyp,False,False,[],"This is probably going to get buried but here's the perspective of an older professional single mom. My daughter is 20, I'm 48, so much younger than your mom.

First, you sound really angry and frustrated with your mom. Have you considered that she's likely terrified after being at a job for 20 years, and now having to face a new technological world that she's not ready to deal with? She might be in denial, is possibly depressed, and is likely really scared about the situation she's in so is using fantasy thinking (everything is great!) to get her through this time?

I stayed in a job much longer than I should have because it was a safe paycheck. I was underutilized and not learning new skills but knew that if I just showed up, I'd have insurance and could feed my kid.

I got my kid through high school and then got laid off due to a company downsize (video games). I applied for jobs that I thought I could handle just to get a paycheck because I was so afraid that I wouldn't be able to support myself. I lucked out hard and got a job double my former salary and am now in a position to save like crazy, but if I had dropped dead in April or not found this job, I would have left my then 19 year old daughter with debt and no assets except for her college fund.

When my daughter was born in 1999, the advice was to save for your kids college because Social Security would pay for our retirement. I didn't start putting in to my 401k until I was in my mid 30s, because I was putting money aside for my daughter's college. It wasn't until she was in middle school that financial advisers started saying that Social Security wasn't enough and that we shouldn't be paying for kid college - we needed to shift to retirement savings.

As a single mom, I made sure my kid had new school clothes (Target, not Nordstrom), shoes, athletics, internet, orchestra trips, and what not so that she never knew how much we were struggling. She didn't know that I often had to go to the food bank. She knew she had college money and clean clothes and a safe space, with some of the same entitlements that her friends with more money had.

Is it possible that your mom spent every cent of her disposable income to make sure that you were comfortable, rather than worrying you about where your next meal is coming from? You criticize her for having cable, but was she doing that for you rather than worrying about her savings? Do you know that she wasn't worrying about her savings? It doesn't sound like she was jetting off to Europe - it sounds like she was working her to make sure you were safe and housed.

This whole thread has turned in to ""old people and technology, haha"" instead of how you can actually ensure that your mom is safe and housed. 

I don't know anything about the relationship between you and your mom, but you sound super resentful and frustrated with her. And that's likely not helping her to feel like she can move forward. Fear can be immobilizing. Fear and judgement of that fear can be paralyzing.

There are other options than COBRA for health insurance, there are community options to teach her the technology  skills she needs if she can face that she needs to move forward, and there are support groups for out of work elderly people.

Maybe offer her some support rather than bitching about her choices on the internet, when from my POV it sounds like she gave up a lot of herself to raise you as a single mom with no child support and not a lot of emotional support.

Frankly, as a single mom who worked her ass off to keep my kid housed and safe and fed and gave up a lot of retirement savings to do it, I'm grateful to know how thankful my kid is for the work I did to get her to adulthood. Maybe consider the sacrifices she made so that you can have more in your savings at 30 than she does.

What ever you are about to say I can guarantee you that dehumanizing shit heads like you on both sides of the conflict are the reason this is still going on.

&gt;is this notion that Palestinians can do whatever they feel is necessary while people like yourself sit on the sidelines and encourage/justify their every action while rejecting every counter action as a violation of their rights.'

People like my self? Fucking lol, what actions by the Palestinians have I justified in these conversations? The horrendous act of climbing a fucking fence? Meanwhile your sitting there on the sidelines justifying Israel shooting a child, for climbing the fucking fence.

Then using racist logic to come to a claim with zero evidence about how he planned to commit terrorism. Not even Israel is making that claim you nut job.

&gt;They continue to sacrifice generation after generation on the off chance that they'll succeed in forcing Israel's hand while people like you are cheering them and lambasting Israel for defending itself.. 

The hundreds of thousands of Jews currently living in Palestine make me doubt the whole ""were just defending our selves"" bull crap. Hey, by your shitty logic those border hopping settler terrorists all deserved to get murdered by the Palestinians right? 

Its their right to defend their country right?

&gt;i think we both know Israel isn't on the offensive here.

Lol, no we fucking don't. Israel is clearly on the offensive, the settlements are one hundred percent evidence of that. If Israel only wanted peace they wouldn't be encouraging their civilians to move into enemy territory.

&gt;I wonder what this conversation would look like if the Germans rejected peace after ww2, and instead waged a 70 year campaign of terrorism against Europe - lobbing rockets at London, launching suicide bombers to blow up shopping malls in Paris and sending thousands of people to try and breach the border with Poland. I doubt you'd be sitting here excusing their actions as protests.

I wonder how the Israeli people would act if Hamas took over parts of Israel then proceeded to patrol the area and shoot Jewish kids for throwing rocks and climbing fences.

&gt;I doubt you'd be sitting here excusing their actions as protests.

Again, I haven't justified anything. What is going on in Gaza is absolutely a protest, it is also absolutely a riot. Were talking about the 14 year old who got shot to death while unarmed and climbing a fence. You got video of this kid rioting? Then we can talk about what I will and won't justify, untill then, the only thing I am saying is that climbing a fence doesn't make you a rioter., and being a Palestinian at a protest even one involving riots, doesn't make you a fucking terrorist.

If you can't understand that then oh well, I have put too much energy already into trying to argue with racists.",True,False,False,,,0,1572588309,,False,0,{},f5zub1z,False,t3_dp9ba8,False,True,t1_f5zswmn,/r/worldnews/comments/dp9ba8/a_mockery_of_justice_outrage_over_onemonth/f5zub1z/,False,,1580524448,1,True,False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,r/worldnews,public,0,

Unfortunately people coming in with attitude like this are sometimes the worst. So I service gear, I know its fairly simple if you take the time to learn it and almost anyone can do it if they take the time. But where I worked I was simply not allowed to sell regulator parts to anyone that was not pre-approved by the owner of the group (mostly dive shop managers etc. Using regs from that particular brand that had previosly shown us technician certs from manufacturers). 

People coming in trying to buy service kits etc. used to give us huge amounts of shit for it. Berating us, telling how theyre serviced gear since our grandparents were kids or something like that, literally walking around the sales rep repeating their demands loudly and slowly word by word like the rep was mentally challenged as we told them we are not allowed. After they were done with us the manager always had to be called down just to tell them the same thing we just did. 

I know how it is and I understand the customers frustration (but not the attitude),  but as the customer wont be offering me a work permit to stay in the country and paying me a salary to get by, I cannot afford to get fired for them. Now that Im not working there anymore, even I wont be able to go buy service kits from them, even though my job was servicing regs on that same shop before I left (or I could try to talk to the owner but I probably wont). Luckily in Europe you can just buy the kits so Ill just order/have someone bring them over from there.

For example, let's boil everything down to impact, when I read those sections, I like what I am seeing, but it's not what I'm used to see as EU/Canadian/US recruiter ;) 

So, in resume summary talk about total work experience, end-to-end testing of large scale applications(scale matters, numbers are what will help you stand apart), list down high level industry with compliances in brackets(SEC 104a anyone? :D), mention your PM methodology there too(Scrum). The whole summary should be like 3 lines max with two sentences (I have data to prove that it works best). 

Now, at the end it depends on whether if you are applying for a job that's hiring in the same industry. If so, I'd double down on specifics and give them exactly what they want to see.

A word of caution when you do that - there's a difference between how a recruiter would see a resume vs how a technical hiring manager(CTO, VPE, Engineering Manager, etc) would see a resume. Recruiters for most of the time don't understand tech and would rather look for keywords, a technical hiring manager would rather get into specifics and would appreciate a zero fluff resume. See who you are talking to and tune your resume to it.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if you are applying for a QA Lead position in a different industry, what will help you build high degree of relevance is if you can show:

1. Your QA skills 
2. Tooling and workflows: Automation testing, scaling of testing, etc 

Because that's all what they can understand from your resume if you send them a resume. Often, they have no idea of how hard it is to ship SEC compliant apps, and how QA intensive those apps are; so, they would just want to see your test coverage skills, your general tooling skills, scale, etc 

&amp;#x200B;

Also in experience, try not to use phrases like these  
""Led  major project to implement an Access Control Framework across application platform"", ""Handling transitioning.."". I would change it to something like ""Helped migration of $250M revenue generating legacy UI from..."" (you can avoid using ""legacy"", just added here to show impact of the right words).

What this means is that poor countries are net creditors to rich countries – exactly the opposite of what we would usually assume. But when we consider the aid budget in its broader context, we should look not only at outward flows but also at the losses and costs that developing countries have suffered as a result of policies devised by rich countries. For instance, when structural adjustment was imposed on the global South during the 1980s and 1990s, they lost around $480 billion each year in potential GDP. That’s nearly four times the size of today’s annual aid budget. More recently, imbalances in the World Trade Organization have caused losses of $700 billion per year in potential export revenues, outstripping the aid budget by a factor of six.

But perhaps the most significant loss has to do with exploitation through trade. From the onset of colonialism through to globalisation, the main objective of the North has been to force down the cost of labour and goods bought from the South. In the past, colonial powers were able to dictate terms directly to their colonies. Today, while trade is technically ‘free’, rich countries are able to get their way because they have much greater bargaining power. On top of this, trade agreements often prevent poor countries from protecting their workers in ways that rich countries do. And because multinational corporations now have the ability to scour the planet in search of the cheapest labour and goods, poor countries are forced to compete to drive costs down. As a result of all this, there is a yawning gap between the ‘real value’ of the labour and goods that poor countries sell and the prices they are actually paid for them. This is what economists call ‘unequal exchange’. In the mid-1990s, at the height of the structural adjustment era, the South was losing as much as $2.66 trillion in unequal exchange each year (in 2015 dollars) – a hidden transfer of value that amounts to twenty-one times the size of today’s aid budget and dwarfs the flow of foreign direct investment.

There are many other structural losses and costs that we could take into account. For example, ActionAid reports that multinational corporations extract about $138 billion from developing countries each year in the form of tax holidays. This figure alone outstrips the global aid budget. Remittances sent home by immigrant workers are slashed by exorbitant transaction fees, costing families $33 billion each year. Global South economies lose about $27 billion in GDP each year because aid disbursements are so volatile, making it very difficult for them to plan investment and manage their budgets. Then there are forms of extraction that are more difficult to quantify, such as the 162 million acres of land (more than five times the size of England) that has been grabbed in global South countries since 2000. And then, of course, there are the damages that developing countries suffer due to climate change – caused almost entirely by rich countries – which are currently estimated to cost $571 billion per year.

The point here is simple: the aid budget is diminutive, almost ridiculously so, when compared to the structural losses and outward flows that the global South suffers. Yes, some aid goes a long way towards making people’s lives better, but it doesn’t come close to compensating for the damage that the givers of aid themselves inflict. Indeed, some of this damage is caused by the very groups that run the aid agenda: the World Bank, for example, which profits from global South debt; the Gates Foundation, which profits from an intellectual-property regime that locks life-saving medicines and essential technologies behind outlandish patent paywalls; and Bono, who profits from the tax haven system that siphons revenues out of global South countries.31

This is not an argument against aid as such. Rather, it is to say that the discourse of aid distracts us from seeing the broader picture. It hides the patterns of extraction that are actively causing the impoverishment of the global South today and actively impeding meaningful development. The charity paradigm obscures the real issues at stake: it makes it seem as though the West is ‘developing’ the global South, when in reality the opposite is true. Rich countries aren’t developing poor countries; poor countries are effectively developing rich countries – and they have been since the late 15th century. So it’s not only that the aid narrative misunderstands what really causes poverty, it’s that it actually gets it *backwards*. Just as in Truman’s time, aid serves as a kind of propaganda that makes the takers seem like givers, and conceals how the global economy actually works.

Perhaps Frantz Fanon, the famous philosopher from Martinique and leading thinker of Algeria’s anti-colonial struggle, put it best:

&amp;#x200B;

*Colonialism and imperialism have not settled their debt to us once they have withdrawn from our territories. The wealth of the imperialist nations is also our wealth. Europe is literally the creation of the Third World. The riches which are choking it are those plundered from the underdeveloped peoples.

I happily will take a small hit to the economy over 5-10 years, if that means we realign our ship with the core tenets of Brexit I originally outlined. You are totally right that in the next 5 years w would be better off GDP wise by staying in the EU. That’s not my primary concern so don’t frame it as such. It’s a terminal mistake that you are making in debating Brexit and will cost you dearly.

Remain lied excessively. The Boris bus was a bit naughty, I’ll give you that. It was cleverly worded to not really be a lie. At worst you could argue that the figure (after rebate) is around 200 million, so Boris was out by about 35 percent. He covered himself however as 350 was closer to the gross figure rather than net. Remain on the other hand made economic predictions, emergency budgets predictions, tax rises and punishment budgets, recession warnings that never came (we’ve seen growth despite the uncertainty), 3 million to lose their jobs but we have record employment in that time. There are a lot of mistruths on both sides. You have to take them with a pinch of salt and make your own choice, but not forgive the establishment for such a shoddy referendum.

We can’t lobby FoM in the EU and expect anything but laughing faces. So you can’t be allowed to let that one go unchallenged.

There have been lots of posters convinced no deal is inevitable, that the UK would be plunged into recession, and that the pound had already begun a journey of inevitable collapse.

And probably isn't interested in doing so anyway. There could be a few reasons for that: it always had a weak economy and rather weak institutions, but a strong military. Therefore, Russian policy planers are inherently pushed towards using military means to achieve political objectives, which usually means use of force, but which also automatically kills any chance of warming relations with the West because that's not a basis on which Westerners want to treat with. Russia is also a kleptocratic mafia-state, and people who rule these sorts of organizations typically prefer weak institutions and little rule of law to do business in, which is the opposite of what the EU is trying to project. And lastly, shoring up nationalistic feelings of self-victimization as a way to distract from poor internal governance has always been very easy and very effective.

There is just no way to handle a country like that in a positive, constructive way. The alternative is containing Russia and shielding vulnerable European states from Russian influence, and wait.

That's how we understand what they are directing their attention to. How was Pius not directing his attention to the fallout of Europe, and the nature of those things that were responsible? His terms were very contextualized, even put into quotes, according to John Henry Newman at least.

""To take a familiar parallel, among many which occur daily. Protestants speak of the ""Blessed Reformation;"" Catholics too talk of ""the Reformation,"" though they do not call it blessed. Yet every 'reformation' ought, from the very meaning of the word, to be good, not bad; so that Catholics seem to be implying a eulogy on an event which, at the same time, they consider a surpassing evil. Here then they are taking the word and using it in the popular sense of it, not in the Catholic. They would say, if they expressed their full meaning, 'the so-called reformation.' In like manner, if the Pope condemned 'the Reformation,' it would be utterly sophistical to say in consequence that he had declared himself against all reforms; yet this is how Mr. Gladstone {252} treats him, when he speaks of (so-called) liberty of conscience.""

John Henry Newman's commentary on this seems to be defintive.  

""To make this distinction clear, viz., between the Catholic sense of the word 'conscience,' and that sense in which the Pope condemns it, we find in the Recueil des Allocutions, &amp;c., the words accompanied with quotation-marks, both in Pope Gregory's and Pope Pius's Encyclicals, thus:—Gregory's, ""Ex hoc putidissimo 'indifferentismi' fonte,"" (mind, 'indifferentismi' is under quotation-marks, because the Pope will not make himself answerable for so unclassical a word) ""absurda illa fluit ac erronea sententia, seu potius deliramentum, asserendam esse ac vindicandam cuilibet 'libertatem conscientiæ.'"" And that of Pius, ""Haud timent erroneam illam fovere opinionem a Gregorio XVI. deliramentum appellatam, nimirum 'libertatem conscientiæ' esse proprium cujuscunque hominis jus."" Both Popes certainly scoff at the so-called 'liberty of conscience,' but there is no scoffing of any Pope, in formal documents addressed to the faithful at large, at that most serious doctrine, the right and the duty of following that Divine Authority, the voice of conscience, on which in truth the Church herself is built.""

""So indeed it is; did the Pope speak against Conscience in the true sense of the word, he would commit a suicidal act. He would be cutting the ground from under his feet. His very mission is to proclaim the moral law, and to protect and strengthen that 'Light which enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world.' On the law of conscience and its sacredness are founded both his authority in theory and his power in fact. Whether this or that particular Pope in this bad world always kept {253} this great truth in view in all he did, it is for history to tell. I am considering here the Papacy in its office and its duties, and in reference to those who acknowledge its claims. They are not bound by the Pope's personal character or private acts, but by his formal teaching. Thus viewing his position, we shall find that it is by the universal sense of right and wrong, the consciousness of transgression, the pangs of guilt, and the dread of retribution, as first principles deeply lodged in the hearts of men, it is thus and only thus, that he has gained his footing in the world and achieved his success. It is his claim to come from the Divine Lawgiver, in order to elicit, protect, and enforce those truths which the Lawgiver has sown in our very nature, it is this and this only that is the explanation of his length of life more than antediluvian. The championship of the Moral Law and of conscience is his raison d'être. The fact of his mission is the answer to the complaints of those who feel the insufficiency of the natural light; and the insufficiency of that light is the justification of his mission.""

This goes on at some length.

This does not say the document isn't infallible. It is. But it should be properly understood, and I think John Henry Newman makes a convincing argument to this effect. Of course the Pope's were speaking on a specific reality associated with certain terms that were being used, not ultimately or universally, but in that time and instance, in a certain way, to express that reality. I don't think it goes beyond that. 

""It is a rule in formal ecclesiastical proceedings, as I shall have occasion to notice lower down, when books or authors are condemned, to use the very words of the book or author, and to condemn the words in that particular sense which they have in their context and their drift, not in the literal, not in the religious sense,""

En perf, c'est entre la RTX2080 et la RTX2080 superc'est la hardware de la RTX2080 avec 3 fois plus de mémoireMais non overclocké comme la 2080 superEnfin, pour l'infinite, c'est la RTX6000Soit une quadro avec le hardware de la RTX2080TI mais encore ici 3 fois plus de mémoire. Donc performances égale à une RTX titan

There are people in NL, Flanders, and Wallonia who would probably prefer something like your idea, but they're very small groups. The greater Lowlands (including the Netherlands and Belgium) were ruled in a more or less integrated fashion for a long time as the Burgundian Netherlands, and later the Habsburg Netherlands. When the northern regions rebelled against Habsburg (Spanish) authority, a number of Flemish joined in, but the fall of Antwerp in 1585 meant the effective separation of the Netherlands and Flanders, as the North went on to consolidate as the Dutch Republic, and the South remained under Spanish rule. A little over two centuries later, after the end of Napoleonic rule, the European Great Powers decided that Belgium would be added to the Netherlands (as it then existed) to create the United Kingdom of the Netherlands under Willem I, as a buffer state against possible future French expansionism. While the King did put a lot effort in economic development and supported efforts to boost the status of the Dutch language in Belgium, regionalism and political tensions between the constituents of the Kingdom meant that it it ultimately lasted only 15 years until the Belgian Revolution erupted and, with French help, Belgium secceeded.

Ultimately, the two regions have been separate entitites, and have diverged as such, for far longer than they have been together. While we have a shared history and speak the same language, profound cultural and political differences have emerged between the two countries that make 'reunification' a pretty unlikely scenario. The vast majority of people are fine with the current situation, not in the least because most people in a position to decide in NL *really* don't want to get involved in the debate about state reform in Belgium. Polls bearing out Dutch people's largely positive attitude towards a hypothetical 'reunification' with Flanders/Belgium that occasionally get posted here and on the national subreddits lack the crucial context that such polls are really just a reflection of how fond most Dutchies are of the Flemish.

  Por mês, o serviço [156](https://agora.folha.uol.com.br/grana/2019/10/morador-reclama-de-barulho-em-igreja-veja-outras-reclamacoes.shtml) recebe mais de 200 reclamações sobre poda e corte irregular. No mercado criminoso, o sumiço de uma árvore tem preço: em torno de R$ 2.000. 

 A reportagem apurou que casos de pequenos grupos que realizam cortes são comuns em outras regiões da cidade. O caso do coqueiro cortado na [Vila Mariana](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2019/09/gestao-covas-suspende-por-120-dias-fiscal-milionario-suspeito-de-propina.shtml) foi uma exceção porque os suspeitos foram identificados. 

 A reclamação dos moradores saudosos do coqueiro pelas redes sociais chegou ao subprefeito da região, Fabrício Cobra. O servidor logo desconfiou da história e, ao verificar, descobriu que não havia autorização para o corte daquela árvore —o que envolve análise de técnicos.

  ""Desde que assumi [em janeiro] recebi três denúncias de pessoas dizendo que terceiros vêm oferecer o serviço de corte e poda irregular. Eu peço para as pessoas denunciarem, mas ninguém quis. Mas dessa vez o cara havia deixado um cartão"", diz Cobra. 

 Um assessor da subprefeitura ligou para o telefone no cartão e começou a se passar por interessado no serviço. Ele conseguiu um orçamento de R$ 2.000, mas passou a protelar o dia do corte da árvore na esperança conseguir mais informações sobre a quadrilha. Durante esse tempo, conversou com três homens diferentes. 

 ""Você tem um caminhão para fazer a retirada?"", questionou o assessor. ""Tem sim, tem motosserra, tem caminhão"", respondeu um dos homens, que garantiu ter um uniforme da prefeitura para passar despercebido. 

 Outro homem tentou tranquilizar o assessor que se passava por cliente: ""Não dá problema nenhum, porque o bagulho lá vai ser rápido, entendeu? Somos ágeis. E se você quer um horário melhor, é de sábado ou domingo. Por quê? Porque sábado e domingo não tem fiscal na rua"". 

 De posse dos indícios, o subprefeito enviou o material para o Ministério Público. O caso é apurado pela Polícia Civil. 

 De acordo com a delegada Fabiola de Oliveira Alves, responsável pela área de crimes administrativos do DPCC (Departamento de Polícia e Proteção à Cidadania), os suspeitos foram ouvidos. Dois negaram, mas um terceiro admitiu o crime ambiental. 

 O suspeito afirmou que realiza o serviço para complementar a renda, mas não revelou quantas árvores já cortou. 

 Trata-se de um crime de menor potencial ofensivo: destruir plantas de ornamentação em logradouros públicos, com pena de detenção de três meses a um ano. 

 Segundo a polícia, uma moradora da rua, que teria admitido o pagamento pelo serviço, também será ouvida. ""A investigação continua, para saber se houve mais casos"", diz a delegada Fabiola. 

 O subprefeito da Vila Mariana, que também segue apurando o caso, ouvirá a empresa terceirizada A. Tonanni sobre o funcionário. O homem negou que a companhia tenha qualquer ligação com seus atos; a terceirizada afirmou desconhecer a situação. 

 Para o botânico e paisagista Ricardo Cardim, a falta de investimento público abre espaço para ilegalidades. ""Em praticamente todas as esquinas tem aquelas plaquinhas escrito corte e poda, com um celular"", diz. A multa para a infração na cidade é relativamente baixa, de R$ 162, multiplicado pelo porte da planta. Além disso, são pouquíssimos os casos punidos —foram 73 neste ano, totalizando R$ 181 mil em multas. 

 Sem um levantamento completo sobre as árvores na cidade, Cardim diz que fica difícil coibir esse tipo de crime. ""A prefeitura trata a arborização como algo secundário. E não é, pois lidera as reclamações"".   
 Além de liderar as queixas na ouvidoria, os pedidos de avaliação de situação de árvores estão em quarto lugar no portal 156, atrás apenas de tapa-buraco, abordagem de moradores de rua e cartão de estacionamento de idosos. 

 Hoje, há 10.597 solicitações pendentes na cidade de São Paulo. A [prefeitura](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2019/05/covas-preve-acelerar-regulamentacao-da-patinete-e-ampliar-equipes-de-zeladoria-em-sp.shtml) sustenta que tem aumentado as equipes que cuidam das árvores —hoje são 100, contra 77 no ano passado. Além disso, houve aumento nas podas —de janeiro a setembro, foram 83 mil, contra 60 mil no mesmo período de 2018. 

 Entre árvores que caem por conta própria ou recebem uma ajudinha, a cidade perde milhares de exemplares por ano —no ano passado, foram 4.447 quedas e outras 11,6 mil removidas legalmente, sem contar os casos ilegais. 

 O resultado é que São Paulo faz cada vez mais jus à fama de cidade cinzenta. Pesquisa do Laboratório Senseable City, do Instituto de Tecnologia de Massachusetts (MIT), divulgada em 2017, calculou que o índice de cobertura verde urbano em São Paulo é de 11,7%. De 23 cidades analisadas no mundo, a capital fica atrás apenas de Quito, no Peru, (10,8%), e Paris, na França, (8,8%).

 Na rua da Vila Mariana onde a árvore foi cortada, os moradores cobram um plano de arborização, incluindo um coqueiro novo. ""Na semana do corte, as maritacas que viviam ali ficaram rondando o coqueiro. Depois, elas desapareceram"", diz a moradora que denunciou e pediu para não ser identificada.

Also the lebensraum ideology came way later. The creation of Prussia happened mainly due to a polish duke asking the teutonic knights for help against pagans. For quite some time, the expansion of prussia was directly correlated with crusades against pagans and the christianization of Eastern europe and much less a ""prussian"" or German project rather than a Christian one.

Only after they basically had converted all the pagans, did the teutonic order start attacking other christian regions just to gain influence and land. This was also one of the main reasons why the order was eventually disbanded as it lost its legitimacy as a force against pagans.

There is no need to romanticize Prussia because as I've already said, Prussia achieved more than just fighting. The heliocentric model was invented by Copernicus (who was a prussian) and the Albertina University in Königsberg was a center of thought and sciences which brought forth world famous (in their respective fields) alumni such as Emmanuel Kant, David Hilbert, Christian Goldbach, Gustav Robert Kirchhoff, Hermann von Helmholtz, Emil Johann Wiechert, E. T. A. Hoffmann and many more...

Königsberg alone played a major role in the progression of humanism and enlightenment whereas other cities (that didn't even exist prior to the teutonic order) became important centers of trade in the hanseatic league to the point that goods from prussia became synonymous with luxury (fun fact: the word ""spruce"" literally means from prussia). 

Many people like to depict Prussia as a malicious cancer of the early 20th century and forget about everything else that came from Prussia. Throughout history it was usually always the few people in power who were responsible for the image of a nation and very rarely the fault of a whole nation that things went badly.

Saying that nazi germany was a continuation of Prussia is also questionable at the very least as the core ideology of nazi Germany predates prussia itself and hatred towards Jews was common all over the continent (for a long time) and not an exclusive phenomenon of Prussia.

While Prussia certainly played its part in the start of world war I, it is heavily debated among historians what actually caused the war and among the few things that historians can probably agree on, one of them likely is, that the start of world war I was complex and had multiple causes.

From where?


&gt;Only in autocratic despot states have I seen the military and it’s leaders placed on such a pedestal and having such a prominent role in public life. 

They're forced to do so, we do so willingly, because we have the best military on earth that several other countries rely upon for their safety and freedom.





&gt;Preferential treatment for veterans? The idea that military service is the highest form of civic service?


Should they just be treated like the mailman? What kind of Civic service would you deem higher?


&gt;The blind unquestioning faith in the military above other institutions? The weird idea that militant service people have a final say on matters around the flag and the anthem and patriotism? 

&gt;Bizarre. 


Or they aren't blind, and see the military for what it is and appreciate it? Are you
""blindly"" against them? &amp; They definately have more of a say to us than sports athletes, that's part of the point. But we pay tribute to them every time we sing the national anthem period. Whats wrong with that?









&gt;it’s a huge jump from there to the weird acts of thanking soldiers in the streets and acting as if being stationed on a base in Germany for a year is the greatest thing an American can possibly do. 

Whats weird about thanking them for their service? I find it weird that youre so taken aback by people doing that. Nor is anyone thanking them for being ""stationed in Germany"" either. That's just dumb to even imply they're thanking them based on that. 

Thanking them for the fact that if our nation was ever attacked, they'd be the ones protecting you whether you love them or question their heroism, make no mistake they would give their life to protect you if this country was in danger, and their existence alone deters that from happening.


&gt;It’s a very Americana obsession. I imagine it has been carefully cultivated over the years to keep the profitable business of war ticking over for people who absolutely do not serve. 

Yeah.. of course it's some big sweeping conspriacy theory. So really it's not just about you accusing people of being pro military, it's about you claiming there's some over arching campaign to control people's thoughts about the military.

Reality is this. Brexit will cost us an exorbitant amount of money for little to no benefit. It will decrease our wealth. It will increase paperwork. It will place our way of life at risk for the benefit of the few. Our food is at risk in terms of quality. Our NHS is at risk in terms of its quality, independence, research, funding. Our government wishes to make a deal with a man who is a clear and open racist and who routinely betrays allies. A man who has defended a world leader whose orders killed an innocent women with a WMD. Brexit makes fools of us all and weakens us. The promises of 350 million a week and circular bananas and a return to pounds and pints and every other stupid fucking promise? Were lies. Save the farmers? They were never under threat, fishing?

If you vote to leap out of a tall building based on a lie I have told you about humans being able to survive falls from tall buildings and then it turns out that I was lying to you. Would you jump? No. But here we are. 

There's no benefit to brexit for you. For me? Well a housing crash may mean I could buy two houses and rent one out. More hours mean more exception reporting meaning more money for me.

You need to consider three possible scenarios:

1) Your reservation was for transport and hotel, then you can sue in the UK.

2) Your reservation was only for transport, but it wasn't a direct fly, and an UK city was first arrival point or latest departure point.

For example: London - Madrid - New York or vice-versa.

In that case it doesn't matter where the incident took place. You will always be able to sue in the UK.

3) Your reservation was only for transport and it was a direct fly from a foreign city to another foreign city. In that case you can't sue in the UK.

About EU Regulation for Small Claims, you can sue from the UK but the Court which rule about it won't be an UK court, it will be the court from the airline's country domicile.

In this case you can also go through the EU Order for Payment, but if the airline refuses to pay, it will be the court from the airline's country domicile the one that decides about it.

Finally, remember you can claim up to 250 €, 400 € or 600 € /passenger depending of 1st arrival point - - last departure point distance.

[],,BeerJunky,1413940526.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_izgdy,False,False,[],"Few factors: 

Don't look at the calendar when figuring out when some company will have a new budget.  Where I work the budget year starts 7/1.  A lot of tech companies it starts 8/1.  Why 8/1?  Because a lot of companies like mine have a 7/1 fiscal year start so they stagger a bit behind that and they want to stuff a load of sales into their end of their FY right before they report earnings and companies like mine have fat new budgets for them to target.

The country also matters.  In the US budget is more likely to dictate it but in other countries there are other factors at work.  Places like Germany, UK, etc have very long notice periods.  Typically a few months notice when leaving a job.  Because of that and trying to make things work out with leaving one job, taking another job, having your replacement leave their job and join your company, etc it's very common for many people to change jobs one the first of the year.  When I was working for a company that had offices all over Europe we'd start to see notices pour in around Oct/Nov of departing users with a 12/31 term date and we'd get a massive ramp up in new hires soon after that with Jan 1 start dates.  So in some cases it's more seasonal and some places it's less.  

Apply ALL year round until you get the job you want.  There are always roles out there, sometimes more or less, but there are always roles.  Sticking to just one time of the year might cause you to miss an opportunity.  Always be looking, always be applying and always be ready to jump on something good.  There's always someone that quit and needs to be backfilled, people retiring, people that moved out of state leaving an opening, someone that fired for screwing the receptionist, etc.  Also, even when you get a new job always STILL keep looking.  You might find something even better down the road or at the very least you are keeping your eye on the market so you better understand the market.  This will help you understand if you are getting paid the right rate (helpful in negotiating a raise later), it will help you to see similar roles in the market and identify trends in what places are looking for.

I think that would be popular with Joe and Joanne Bloggs until the press got hold of them.

I can imagine that's how the right-wing press would tell the story. 

Left-wing economic policies would mean such a leader couldn't win over the right like Blair did, and it's hard to convince the anti-war left to support any military spending. Corbyn sticking by his principles at least appeals to people who have the same beliefs, as impractical as they seem to other people.

[],,williambotter,1542234059.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_2lm23pua,False,False,[]," Há algum tempo, eu venho pesquisando sobre o que chamo de solidão institucional da mulher negra.

 Em 2018, participei do Programa Angela Davis para Professor Convidado, na Universidade Goethe, em Frankfurt, e parte da minha aula ministrada lá foi sobre esse tema. Há pesquisas importantes sobre a solidão afetiva das mulheres negras, que mostram que elas, sobretudo as de pele escura, não são vistas como pessoas para casamento ou relacionamentos mais duradouros, mas por um prisma da objetificação dos seus corpos. Porém, penso, a solidão para as mulheres negras é algo mais profundo.

 Mulheres negras em trabalhos de faxineira ou servente são as “tias da limpeza”, as “tias do café”. Nem sequer são chamadas pelo nome, muitas vezes as pessoas nunca perguntaram. Só sabem que elas moram longe, mas nunca perguntaram onde. Não as tratam como seres humanos com histórias, significados, aprendizados, mas sempre com o olhar da condescendência para disfarçar a superioridade que sentem em relação a elas. Será que já perguntaram quais eram os sonhos delas? Ou naturalizaram o lugar que elas ocupam?

 Sempre me questiono o quanto é solitário, muitas vezes, ser a única pessoa que se incomoda quando, em espaços mais privilegiados, observa que as mulheres como eu não estão usufruindo e coexistindo, mas sempre servindo ou atendendo aos desejos de pessoas que nem sequer, muitas vezes, as olham nos olhos.

  Eu imagino a solidão de nem sequer ser vista, de ser possível passar anos trabalhando em um lugar sem que as pessoas saibam o seu nome.

 Lélia Gonzalez, grande intelectual negra brasileira, dizia que mulher negra tem de ter nome e sobrenome para que o racista não pusesse o nome que quisesse.

 Antes de se casar com meu pai, [minha mãe](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/djamila-ribeiro/2019/10/carta-para-minha-filha.shtml) foi empregada doméstica, e me lembro de ela contar da solidão do elevador de serviço, do quartinho na área de serviço, de ter de agradecer efusivamente por ganhar casacos velhos.

 Há também a solidão de ser “a primeira negra que…” ou “a única negra que…”. Para aquelas que, com muita dificuldade, conseguiram romper algumas barreiras, há a tristeza institucionalizada de olhar para o lado e ver poucas ou quase nenhuma como ela. 

 As pessoas não imaginam o quão hostil é estar em um lugar em que só você é a pessoa negra ou é aquela que vai ser posta no lugar da chata agressiva porque só fala disso. De olhar para o lado e não perceber um olhar de acolhimento quando passa por situações discriminatórias. De ser desacreditada, atacada porque as pessoas esperam a queda de quem ousou sair do seu lugar. 

 A solidão de ser sempre a negra agressiva e raivosa [por exigir ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/djamila-ribeiro/2019/09/a-boca-nao-vence-a-guerra.shtml)[respeito](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/djamila-ribeiro/2019/09/a-boca-nao-vence-a-guerra.shtml). Ou de ser a metida porque anda de cabeça erguida. Ou ainda, a arrogante porque é decidida ou assertiva. Vocês já se questionaram de onde vêm certos incômodos ou por que tentam justificá-los atacando quem as incomodou?

 Penso na solidão dos milhares de mães negras que perdem seus filhos cotidianamente por causa de uma política de segurança pública violenta. A solidão daquelas que sabem da falta de oportunidades de seus filhos, daquelas que tentam mostrar que os filhos eram trabalhadores. Essa solidão pode gerar adoecimentos psíquicos. Com todo respeito a Foucault, em “História da Loucura”, ele se esqueceu que o racismo causa danos psíquicos à população negra.

 O que significa ter de ser forte o tempo todo? É desumano exigir essa força descomunal das mulheres negras. Elas precisam ser fortes porque o Estado é omisso.

 Essa exigência de força atesta a ilegalidade do Estado. Poder assumir as fragilidades e tristezas e ter atenção a saúde mental de qualidade seria restituir de humanidade essas mulheres.

 Mais uma vez, recorro a minha mãe, que morreu tão jovem, aos 51 anos, cheia de dores represadas e tristezas não ditas —com palavras que nunca disse, apesar de seu silêncio gritar muitas vezes. Acho que, além de mim, ninguém perguntou à minha mãe onde doía ou perguntou sobre seus sonhos interrompidos pelas desigualdades e pela falta de atenção.

Americans today identify as Scottish, Irish, English and Italian, sometimes without qualification. They recognise cultural and racial influence from ancestral lines whilst still recognising themselves as Americans.  

This is not unique to Americans. Rudyard Kipling (of *The Jungle Book* fame) identified as Anglo-Indian because he grew up in the English colony of Bombay (now Mumbai). He obviously saw himself as British but identified as a different sort of Brit because of his geographical and cultural surroundings. As [Kipling's wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudyard_Kipling) asserts: 

&gt; Kipling wrote of Bombay:

&gt; Mother of Cities to me,

&gt; For I was born in her gate,

&gt; Between the palms and the sea,

&gt; Where the world-end steamers wait.[23]

&gt; According to Bernice M. Murphy, ""Kipling's parents considered themselves 'Anglo-Indians' [a term used in the 19th century for people of British origin living in India] and so too would their son, though he spent the bulk of his life elsewhere. Complex issues of identity and national allegiance would become prominent in his fiction.""[24]

This is a common story for European settlers throughout the colonial period.

Hello! We're a **support guild for players with disabilities** that don't feel comfortable with joining group content and need a safe environment to exchange tips and ask for help. Our goal is to create a safe community where running trials, veteran and normal dungeons, arenas, questing, and challenging content in general is not only achievable for everybody but also more inclusive.

It is required that our members have some form of disability or chronic condition be that mental, physical or both. It's allowed to invite your caregiver or an in-game supportive friend of your choice. All levels are welcome!

* **We consider disabilities:** Anxiety disorders, autism spectrum disorders, chronic illnesses, depression, physical impairments, cognitive disabilities, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**The rules are simple:**

* Be kind and respectful at all times. Keep it ""safe for work"". No rushing others to be faster at playing.
* Everyone can organize groups for dungeons, trials, farming, and other events. Just let us know within a reasonable amount of time.
* We encourage members to help each other whenever you can.

&amp;#x200B;

We also have a guild house with a transmutation station and target dummies.

We hope that you can find your safe space among us.

*Leave a comment or PM us with your account name to be invited to the guild and Discord server, and let us know how the guild can help you have a better in-game experience (example: I have social anxiety but I need to farm a dungeon!). We totally understand.* ♡

You are also free to apply through our website or by contacting us in-game.

I did. The graph includes Birman's figures, which are quoted in the conclusion. Your fault if you can't read graphs. But don't accuse others of leaving out things you're incapable of seeing.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The guy above you, who's point you were attempting to support said this:  
&gt;  
&gt;*American  and Soviet citizens eat about the same amount of food each day but the  Soviet diet may be more nutritious. According to a CIA report released  today both nationalities may be eating too much for good health. The CIA  drew no conclusions about the nutritional makeup of the Soviet and  American diets but commonly accepted U.S. health views suggest the  Soviet diet may be slightly better.*  
&gt;  
&gt;Which was entirely wrong.

It wasn't entirely wrong. He merely stated the conclusions of the CIA study, which he did not misrepresent. In good faith I assumed (and you should too) that he didn't have access to the Nintil article, which makes the same good-faith assumption:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Was Soviet caloric intake higher than the US’?**  
&gt;  
&gt;No. In saying this, I’m saying the FAO is wrong, and that Robert  Allen, who based his calculations in FAO data (and used their  multipliers), didn’t notice. To say this, I had to go through a full  literature review, and I come to this opinion. ***Before reading my post,  you were totally justified in believing that caloric intake was higher.***

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, the CIA study also breaks down nutrition figures and shows that Soviets had considerably less meat than US citizens, a conclusion unchanged from Birman's report, although the numbers differ.

&amp;#x200B;

You're mistaken if you think my argument hinges on whether citizens of the USSR (a country that the US had a 100-year head start on industrialization) ate better than the richest country on Earth. My argument has been that citizens of the late USSR ate much better than they did before under capitalism and better than they do today and better than many third-world capitalist countries that grew out of similar circumstances, among other things. [Many Russians seem to agree that things have gotten worse under capitalism, too](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/10/PG_10.15.19.europe.values-01-013.png?w=624).

More likely it was due to interspecies exposure with many livestock or consumption species of animals.

China's biodiversity allowed it the mixed blessing of plenty of domesticatable animals, which also means plenty of chances to contract some deadly disease from parasites, or bloodborne diseases in the case of improper cooking.

At around the time that the bubonic plague hit Europe, the Mongols had also conquered much of China and had turned westward. They may have brought the disease with them.

China has generally had a huge population throughout history, thanks to its early exploitation of the agricultural lands around two major rivers - so a plague, while bad news, still meant that any percentage of survivors usually still was quite numerous.

&gt; the inability to domestically favour British goods over EU ones

Farage doesn't care about British goods. He's more a libertarian than anything, and if anything offends him it's not being able to import more foreign cheap goods

&gt; Boris' deal ties us to a huge amount of that in the future

AFAIK this is just wrong. The WA had all the areas binding taken out and put in the PD that could be ignored. All Boris' WA really means is that we have two years to leave and we can easily leave with no deal..and that would be up to the government of the day, not parliament.

&gt; We cant free trade with America and get chlorinated chicken on Boris' deal

If we want, we can in two years. I'm not sure what Farage is up to..scared Boris may backtrack and get a closer EU deal maybe. Farage is definitely trying to get him to drop the deal..IMHO it is because the real terms won't be known till the transition period is up..and it could still be anything from a soft brexit to no deal

&gt; Cummings and Boris have made it clear they precisely zero interest in a pact - which would Tories to stand down in certain areas

There's a pact and ""a pact"". Farage would prefer the former, but Johnson would never not run Tories in over 100 seats. Boris would prefer just to not spend any money on those seats and let Farage do his best.

&gt; But Farage's end game was never ever going to be this election, because he cant win it and become PM

I'm still not convinced Farage wants anything more than to see a hard Brexit go through and sail off into the sunset. Maybe do some lucrative after-dinner speaking and talking head spots on the US conservative circuit.

&gt; Farage believes that eventually leave voters will not only resent the EU alignment of Boris' deal, but grow tired of the whole process which no deal circumnavigates. 

You could be right, he could be distancing himself from the fallout. But no deal just starts the cycle again of trade negotiations...starting with the EU demanding £39bn and no border in Ireland. Farage knows that

&gt; Farage believe his core, hard Brexit right wing base are the long term path to political victory

Useful idiots, there to be used and then thrown away. 

&gt; Farage sees a path to victory at the election after the next one

I think he'll be supping a margarita on a tropical beach after being handsomely paid for Brexit. In 5 years time, the EU will be paid, or not, deals will be done or not..but the last thing anyone will want to hear is the word Brexit

&gt;  id say that covers the broadest outline of the BXP-but-not-Tory voter.

He does...it's just not big compared to the percentage of traditional Tories he attracts. He's going to cause some chaos..but I reckon the bigger his vote in areas, the bigger the Labour majority.

[],,Lamont-Cranston,1381214191.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_dfgjj,False,False,[],"Their father Fred Koch was a Nazi sympathiser and co-founder of the John Birch Society, the group that opposed the Civil Rights movement and School Integration accusing them of being Communist plots to undermine Americas white, Christian, purity.

Charles Koch was a member and ran a Bircher bookstore in Wichita.

Later he got involved with Robert LeFevres Freedom School, aka Rampart College. It was there that he discovered the Austrian economics of Ludwig von Mises, F.A. Hayek, and Murray Rothbard which he considered a revelation giving him the solutions he had been seeking. Right alongside the Austrian economists on its faculty were also Segregationists and Holocaust Deniers like James J. Martin who chaired its history department and Harry Elmer Barnes published in its journal.

Barnes wrote this in The American Mercury in 1964:

&gt;The courageous author [Paul Rassinier] lays the chief blame for misrepresentation on those whom we must call the swindlers of the crematoria, the Israeli politicians who derive billions of marks from nonexistent, mythical and imaginary cadavers, whose numbers have been reckoned in an unusually distorted and dishonest manner.

And he wrote this in Rampart Journal in 1966:

&gt;Even if one were to accept the most extreme and exaggerated indictment of Hitler and the national socialists for their activities after 1939 made by anybody fit to remain outside a mental hospital, it is almost alarmingly easy to demonstrate that the atrocities of the Allies in the same period were more numerous as to victims and were carried out for the most part by methods more brutal and painful than alleged extermination in gas ovens.

Charles Koch had been an Executive, Trustee, and Funder at the Freedom School/Rampart College for 2 years by that time.

After its collapse in the late 1960s he took charge of the Institute for Humane Studies (he is still the chairman of its board to this day and between 2005-2017 donated 34 million to it) where Martin began hosting seminars.

With the start of the 1970s, and perhaps inspired by the [Powell Memorandum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_F._Powell_Jr.#Powell_Memorandum), he teamed up with the Austrian economist Murray Rothbard and they first founded Reason Foundation to publish Reason Magazine, in its early days it published a special Holocaust Denial issue treating people like Martin, Austin J. App, Percy Greaves, and Gary North like professionals merely challenging the stuffy orthodoxy of the ivory tower elitists:

&gt;MARTIN: Well, I never made a head count of all who lost their lives in the War—we've seen a wide variety of statistical materials, some of which have been pulled out of thin air... I don't believe that the evidence of a planned extermination of the entire Jewish population of Europe is holding up. [...] The German concentration camps weren't health centers, but they appear to have been far smaller and much less lethal than the Russian ones. As proof that the Holocaust was a hoax, Martin told Reason's ""journalists"" that he relied on the works of Europe’s leading Holocaust denier, Paul Rassinier, whose books — “Debunking the Genocide Myth,” “The Drama of European Jewry” — described Nazi concentration camps as “a gesture of compassion” designed by the Nazis to “rehabilitate the strayed sheep.” According to Rassinier, the Holocaust was a “swindle” concocted by money-grubbing Zionists out to “make Germany an ever-lasting milk cow for Israel.”

Then they started a little outfit that you may have heard of called the Cato Institute, which Martin gave lectures at just like at IHS as well as writing introductions to [pamphlets of Barnes essays](https://np.reddit.com/r/KochWatch/comments/aw7fxp/in_about_1980_the_cato_institute_published_a/?st=k2gev6ts&amp;sh=ba255b48).

He also provided Murray Rothbard with the funds to establish the Center for Libertarian Studies, which Martin was on the board of.

After splitting with Murray Rothbard in the early 1980s - accounts vary as to why, I have variously heard it had to do with the poor result of the Libertarian Party in the 1980 election or perhaps internal fighting over the management of Cato or perhaps even that money had been leant for a book that never materialised - he found a new economic guru in James McGill Buchanan and installed him at George Mason University which he has given vast sums to, 85 million between just 2005-2017, which has secured him a de facto control over the colleges faculty hiring and curriculum despite being a public university.

Buchanan got his start in economics trying to devise a way for Virginia to maintain segregation and avoid federal intervention by crafting tax credits to fund tuition at private schools that would be devoid of any openly racist rhetoric.

With the split between Murray Rothbard and Charles Koch in the early 1980s Charles appears to have left behind these more overt associations with extremists - but operating through passthroughs and intermediate groups continues to support many academics involved with the Ludwig von Mises Institute, Charles Murray, TPUSA, Daily Caller, Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson, etc

The Koch networks biggest fixation is on deregulation starting with the environment because many of Koch Industries practices are heavily polluting dumping waste into waterways and emitting into the atmosphere, not to mention their fossil fuel interests producing CO2; oh&amp;s because their workplace safety standards are atrocious as they cut staff and training to cut costs increasing the number of accidents, impose Charles Kochs ideas of 'Market Based Management' that rank staff by job performance with the low ranking facing the threat of job loss encouraging them to take risks and cause accidents, and frequently expose their workforce to the same chemicals they're dumping - for all their talk of opposing big government [they're perfectly fine with lobbying it to pass legislation protecting them from liability for endangering their workforce](https://www.exposedbycmd.org/2019/08/01/koch-closes-plant-after-huge-epa-fine/); financial because of Koch Industries crown jewel is its commodities trading division which uses the inside knowledge of Kochs oil and gas refining to buy and sell futures and derivatives ahead of the market - although Enron gets the blame for the 2001 power crisis in California it was the Kochs lobbying through ALEC that pushed through deregulation in the first place and it was Koch traders right alongside Enron that were gaming the market and causing chaos.

Another area they are getting involved in is opposing electric vehicles and public transportation - the intention here is patently obviously a craven desire to stop any competition to the reliance on oil that comes with total automotive dependency.

But they are also involved in fights they have no financial stake in like opposing public healthcare and pushing for school privatisation. These are clearly ideologically consistent principals. But you can't help but wonder if the desire to privatise schools is a continuation of the work of their father and Buchanan, to create a new segregation enforced not by laws or cross burning but market based dictates?

One the chief ways they are achieving their goals is through ALEC. ALEC is a policy generating body that gets corporate lobbyists and state legislators to together and produce 'model bills' that its members can then take home and introduce in their legislatures. It is very easy to get a state legislator elected and they can wield enormous power. It was founded by Paul Weyrich a fundamentalist evangelical who also co-founded the Heritage Foundation and the Council for National Policy. [The man did not believe in democracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GBAsFwPglw). ALEC members and its 'model bills' have been the source of much of the Voter Disenfranchisement that has been going on in recent years, the members are also the source of the rampant gerrymandering. Aided by the Kochs fake grassroots front group Americans for Prosperity campaigning for them and against their opponents they are soon able to secure power this way gaining a 2/3 majority in many states despite getting under 50% of the vote, Wisconsin and North Carolina being the worst examples, they then begin passing legislation benefiting the ALEC donors and directors like Koch Industries from tax cuts for the rich to environmental/labor/financial deregulation, union-busting, cutbacks to public schools and Medicaid, etc

If it is a followup then isn't Remain explicitly rejected? Why isn't it No Deal vs Deal? We have established our desire to leave but not the manner in which we leave, therefore we need another referendum to decide that.

(1) Flaherty writes there was indeed a meeting at Jekyll Island, that it was indeed secret, and that the plan devised at that meeting was indeed the blueprint for the Federal Reserve act. Flaherty then goes on about the Owen-Glass act, but omits the important fact that it was delivered to Colonel House by J.P. Morgan (Jr) himself.^1 J.P. Morgan (Sr) organised the Jekyll Island meeting. So, both the Aldrich Plan and the Owen-Glass Act had the same roots - the Morgan banking dynasty. The act was pre-printed, but was then secretly converted to a typewritten document to avoid suspicion, which is another conspiracy in itself. The conspirators feared that a printed act would raise suspicion of Wall Street banker ties, probably because it was unusual to have a bill printed at the time.^2

(2) Flaherty writes that the Federal Reserve banks are indeed privately owned, so he affirms Griffin here. ""So, the claim that the ""Fed is privately owned"" is correct -- each Federal Reserve Bank is owned by private for-profit commercial banks and S&amp;Ls."" 

(3) Flaherty then strawmans people by saying ""This myth claims that the 12 Federal Reserve banks are privately owned and therefore want to earn a profit just like any other company."" This is of course not what people say. The point is that the Federal Reserve indeed makes a 6% profit for its shareholders, and does not, like many commentators claim ""returns all its profits to the U.S. Government (or Treasury)"". So again this affirmed. They are for-profit institutions, the percentage of profit they make is just regulated.

(4) Flaherty neglects to mention that Benjamin Strong had ""exerted great influence over the policy and actions of the entire Federal Reserve System—and indeed over the financial policies of all of the United States and Europe""^34 Benjamin Strong was President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York! So it seems that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York really does hold extraordinary powers, and that it is not just conspiracy theorists claiming this. Benjamin Strong also secretly met with other Central Bankers - Hjalmar Schacht and Montagu Norman in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in ""complete harmony"".^5

My conclusion is that Flaherty has tried to ""put these myths to rest"", but failed, and for very good reasons. Those reasons are that the ""myths"" are in actuality grounded in facts, and that there are also plenty of professional economists, historians, and other commentators that profess the same claims.

This is complete and utter bullshit you pulled out of your own ass.

Transition *vastly reduces* risk of suicide attempts. Prior to transition about 40% of trans people attempt suicide. After transition that rate drops to the national average. When able to transition young, with access to appropriate transition-related medical care, and when spared abuse and discrimination, trans people are as psychologically healthy as the general public. This is very literally life saving medical care.

And the claim that most trans youth ""desist"" are based on debunked studies that used outdated diagnostic criteria and infamously bad methodology. The AAP guidelines I linked to above cover the origins of this myth and why it has been debunked. 

TL;DR - these studies made no distinction between children who had gender atypical interests, and children who expressed intense, unrelenting distress because they knew themselves to be Gender A while everyone around them insisted they must be Gender B.

These studies identified young children who were deemed gender-variant, and when at age 15 the little girls who just liked trucks and little boys who just liked dolls weren't trans, they were declared to have ""outgrown"" being trans, rather than recognizing that they never expressed dysphoria to begin with.

These studies also made no attempt at reseponsible follow-up. Many of their subjects dropped out before turning 15, and all of them were counted as ""desisters"" despite having absolutely no data on whether they were actually cis or not. And after surveying the subjects at age 15, no attempt was made to follow them into adulthood to see if they actually transitioned later in life. Many of the adolescents in these studies, having been subjected to years of medical and familial humiliation and shame for being trans, lied when asked as teenagers if they were trans. They later transitioned as adults, but were still counted as ""desisters"".

In reality, when dysphoria is used as the criteria for identifying trans youth, and when that dysphoria and a gender identity atypical to one's appearance at birth persist into early adolescence, the chances that it is going to change later are close to zero. Which is why the use of puberty delaying treatment at onset of adolescence, followed by hormone therapy in one's early-/mid-teens, is the treatment recommended by every major US and world medical authority.

**Citations on the transition's dramatic reduction of suicide risk while improving mental health and quality of life, with trans people able to transition young and spared abuse and discrimination having mental health and suicide risk on par with the general public:**

* [**Bauer, et al., 2015**](http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-015-1867-2): Transition vastly reduces risks of suicide attempts, and the farther along in transition someone is the lower that risk gets.

* [**Moody, et al., 2013**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3722435/): The ability to transition, along with family and social acceptance, are the largest factors reducing suicide risk among trans people.

* [**Young Adult Psychological Outcome After Puberty Suppression and Gender Reassignment**](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958). A clinical protocol of a multidisciplinary team with mental health professionals, physicians, and surgeons, including puberty suppression, followed by cross-sex hormones and gender reassignment surgery, provides trans youth the opportunity to develop into well-functioning young adults. All showed significant improvement in their psychological health, and they had notably lower rates of internalizing psychopathology than previously reported among trans children living as their natal sex. **Well-being was similar to or better than same-age young adults from the general population.**

* The only disorders more common among trans people are those associated with abuse and discrimination - mainly anxiety and depression. Early transition [**virtually eliminates these higher rates of depression and low self-worth**](http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567%2816%2931941-4/fulltext), and [**dramatically improves trans youth's mental health**](https://thinkprogress.org/allowing-transgender-youth-to-transition-improves-their-mental-health-study-finds-dd6096523375#.pqspdcee0). Trans kids who socially transition early and not subjected to abuse are comparable to cisgender children in measures of mental health.

My examples included Democratic primary candidates, large groups of protesters on college campuses, current Democratic members of Congress, articles in mainstream news outlets like the Washington Post.

It doesn't. If you understood what I posted you would see that they avoided the tax. So they did not collect the intended money, they did not research the solutions and the problem is bigger than it was before the carbon tax was introduced.

Tell that to people in finland who spend 3 months of the year in darkness. Its not that simple a problem.

He'll always have a special place in my childhood and has been an inspiration in my adulthood. 

When you start AC2 You're introduced with Ezio defending his family name against one of his childhood enemies/family rivals. He's charming, witty, and can handle a punch. I'll never forget racing to the church tower and the small conversation you have with Federico.

Federico: It is a good life we live, brother.

Ezio: The best. May it never change.

Federico: And may it never change us.

In that moment Ezio and Federico weren't Assassins. They were simply brothers enjoying the life they had. It was great. Ezio was just a normal teen who had no idea of his lineage. He enjoyed life, had fun with the ones he loved and was free. I think that's when I knew Ezio was going to be my favorite character. He felt real and was the kind of person I'd want to be around.

When it came to the moment where he witnessed his brothers and father being wrongfully accused and hanged in the public court, it made me feel for Ezio even more. He had everything he could ever want in life, and in one quick swoop he lost 3 of some of the most important people he had, he lost the respect that came with the Auditore name, and he lost his home back in florence.

After that, Ezios life was never the same. He had to fight to protect his mother and sister, he learned of his assassin lineage with Uncle Mario, he gained his revenge against those who plotted against his family, he rebuilt Monteriggioni, he pushed back the Templars (atleast for a short while) and practically restored the Assassin brotherhood by rebuilding the Italian branch and spreading it across Europe.

You just have to keep grinding at it.  It takes time and constant practice.

To make it less boring, practice using verbs ""in context"" instead of just making those awful 2x3 boxes where you fill in ""eu sou, tu es, ...""  For example, have a conversation with a Brazilian native about your past week or about your childhood memories, to practice the preterite and imperfect past tenses.  Talk about your plans for retirement to practice the future tense.  Talk about what you would do if you won a billion dollars, or if you moved to a different country, to practice the subjunctive mood.

Most of the times, I don't even bother with conjugations.  I just talk, I just write, I just listen, etc.  Whenever I get stuck on a verb, I ask how it is conjugated in this particular case, make a quick note, and move on talking or writing or listening.

This works because: the elegant thing about learning new languages is that features / vocabulary / conjugations are the most commonly used appear more often when you use the language, so you naturally practice the most important features more often, simply by design.

 Alícia mora a cerca de 35 km do Palácio da Alvorada, residência oficial da Presidência da República e endereço de onde Bolsonaro saiu nesta manhã. O presidente foi convidado para o aniversário de Alicia, com quem já havia se encontrado em 18 de outubro, em cerimônia realizada na base aérea de Brasília em comemoração ao Dia do Aviador.

 ""É uma criança que teve o direito, a oportunidade, de uma segunda vida. Ela ganhou um coração há poucos anos assim como eu tive um direito à segunda vida, o seu coração foi transportado nas asas da FAB"", disse ao chegar ao local, que teve a segurança reforçada.

  O compromisso não constava na agenda do presidente —divulgada na noite de quinta (31) como ""sem compromissos oficiais""— sob a justificativa de que se tratava de uma ""agenda privada"". 

 Bolsonaro chegou ao local, em região da periferia de Brasília, acompanhado de um grupo de assessores, seguranças e fotógrafos, que registraram a visita.

 Em sua conta pessoal do Facebook foi feita uma transmissão ao vivo do presidente sendo abraçado por apoiadores, que gritavam frases como ""mito"", ""tamo junto, presidente"" e ""Vamos acabar com a rede Globo"".

 Antes de ir ao local, Bolsonaro fez uma outra live pelas redes em que ele aparece cortando o cabelo e anuncia que participará do aniversário da menina. 

 ""Estou dando uma caprichada aqui no barbeiro, nada contra os cabeleireiros, mas tudo bem. Daqui a pouco, depois de uma viagem muito longa ai fora do Brasil, vou dar uma chegadinha em Ceilândia, nada a ver com a primeira-dama, que é de lá. É que eu conheci por conta do dia do aviador uma menina que está fazendo hoje 10 anos de idade"", disse.

 Após o aniversário de Alicia, Bolsonaro foi direto ao Palácio do Planalto, mas sua agenda de compromissos só foi divulgada às 15h. 

 Depois de passar dez dias fora, em viagens para países da Ásia e do Oriente Médio, Bolsonaro chegou em Brasília na manhã de quinta em meio à repercussão de ter seu nome citado nas investigações sobre o assassinato da vereadora Marielle Franco (PSOL). 

 Reportagem do [Jornal Nacional](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2019/10/porteiro-afirmou-que-suspeito-de-matar-marielle-pediu-para-ir-a-casa-de-bolsonaro-diz-tv.shtml) de terça-feira (29) apontou que um porteiro (cujo nome não foi revelado) deu depoimento dizendo que, no dia do assassinato de Marielle, em 14 de março de 2018, Élcio Queiroz —ex-policial militar envolvido no crime— afirmou na portaria do condomínio que iria à casa de Bolsonaro, na época deputado federal.

 Pelo depoimento do porteiro apresentado pela emissora, ao interfonar para a casa de Bolsonaro, um homem com a mesma voz do presidente teria atendido e autorizado a entrada. O suspeito, no entanto, teria ido a outra casa dentro do condomínio.

 O funcionário relatou ter interfonado uma segunda vez para a casa de Bolsonaro, tendo sido atendido pela mesma pessoa, que afirmou saber que a casa 66 era o real destino do visitante. A planilha manuscrita de controle de entrada de visitantes, apreendida no dia 5 de outubro, registra a entrada de Élcio para a casa 58, do presidente.

 Na quarta, a promotora Simone Sibilio afirmou que a investigação teve acesso à planilha da portaria do condomínio e às gravações do interfone e que ficou comprovado que a informação dada pelo porteiro não procede.

 Segundo a Promotoria, há registro de interfone para a casa 65 (enquanto a casa de Bolsonaro é a de número 58), e a entrada de Élcio foi autorizada pelo morador do imóvel, Ronnie Lessa.

Se mostrar as pessoas esta errado, e esta, o certo seria exigir que este post fosse removido em vez de estar a contribuir para o linchamento. 

&gt; Mas em relação ao conteúdo, caso seja verdadeiro (acho mau de mais para ser), indigna as pessoas porque o rapaz claramente não tem filhos como projecto de vida mas apenas para mais um pretexto para pedir mais dinheiro ao estado. 

Em Portugal nao se recebe o suficiente para ter filhos por causa do abono de familia.

He was acting on behalf of the United States (and many European allies) when he demanded Ukraine fire a corrupt prosecutor.

And Trump was acting on behalf of the United states when he asked Ukraine for their cooperation in the investigation of a corrupt politician.

&gt;Do you have any evidence that Biden directly asked the Ukrainians to stop any investigations into Burisma?

There was an active investigation into Burisma when Biden asked them to fire the prosecutor. The prosecutor has also stated that during his investigation, he had been pressured to stop because of foreign pressures.

&gt;Why do you think firing a corrupt prosecutor and replacing him with someone who is honest would help Hunter and Burisma if they were breaking the law? If anything, that would revive the inactive investigation and hurt his son.

You are making a lot of assumptions here. How do you know that the new prosecutor was ""honest"".

&gt;Lastly, if Trump thought Biden had acted against US interest in his demand to fire Shokin, then Biden would have broken US law. Why was Trump pushing Ukraine to investigate, when his own DOJ should have been investigating Biden on this charge.

Isn't that why he said that he would have Barr, the head of the DOJ, call Zelensky?

&gt;I don’t. What specific crimes are you accusing Biden of?

My point is that you are saying that Trump asking Ukraine to cooperate with the DOJ is illegal, but give Biden a free pass for making demands of Ukraine without consulting anyone.",True,False,False,,,0,1572644324,,False,0,{},f61q984,False,t3_dq2wxp,False,True,t1_f61d7u9,/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/dq2wxp/what_would_have_to_be_different_in_order_for_the/f61q984/,False,,1580556749,1,True,False,AskTrumpSupporters,t5_3cr3o,r/AskTrumpSupporters,public,0,

There was definitely hatred of them because they were Catholics and there’s a lot of Catholic v Protestantism hatred that European America inherited from their mother country. 

There was also this arbitrary line within White America during the 1800’s that put Eastern European, Southern European, and the Irish as not being real white people. They were the Mongrel races just a step above the animals (black people). Racist to some maybe, but more ethnicist (not sure it’s a word but it’s the best word I can think of to describe what I’m getting at) to our modern eyes.

This really picked up when Eugenics became popular in the US as a means of justifying and ‘explaining’ why things were the way they were. They certainly spoke about the Irish in terms of race at the time. 

I’d liken the Irish of the 1800’s to the way Hispanic people are treated today with a tinge of segregation. The segregation tinges are only because of the bountiful signs outside businesses saying that Irish people weren’t going to be served or were not allowed to apply for certain jobs, and were usually forced to live in ethnic communities inside cities and such. That’s as deep as it goes. Jim Crow segregation was clearly worse and built atop slavery’s bones, so it was different.

Mbappe created many opportunities but is too one-dimensional in his approach. Always tries to exploit his pace by launching the ball forward and chasing it, overly simplistic, something he hopefully mixes up and develops to be an all-around better player. One major injury that will make him lose a step and he won’t stand out anymore. Dijon did well to double up on him and match his pace on the counter, dispossessed and kept him quiet on occasions. Paredes had a beautiful shot go off the post but is a nothing special player. Marquinhos was tidy, looking sharp but got sloppy towards the end of the game when frustration started taking over. PSGs attack flowed through Di Maria, was instrumental in picking out the right pass and cross, good performance. 

PSG have some massive holes in their squad, the drop of in their attacking prowess to the defense is shocking. Kimpempe looked uncomfortable, arguably should have given a penalty away when he wrapped his arms around Tavarez (?). Bernat and Kurzawa are decent fullbacks, the first named is great going forward, but defensively not very strong. Navas had a poor night, first goal he dropped it, second goal went through his legs on the near post.  A lot of very young promising players in their squad who are valuable assets but are years away from reaching their physical peak and gathering the experience needed. Will be a comfortable title once again, but I can’t see them seriously competing for the CL. 


Navas


Meunier-Silva-Marq-Bernat


Veratti-Gueye-Herrera


Mbappe-Icardi/Cavani-Neymar/Sarabia


Beautiful squad, with silky football, but one injury or suspension to their defense or the defensive-minded midfielders and the drop-off to their substitution is too much for them to go head-to-head against the giants of Europe deep into the knock-out rounds.

I believe they need a class GK, CB, fullback and midfielder in addition to their current squad. In a dream world they pick up De Gea on a free if he didn’t extend his contract next year. Alba who will only have one year left on his, or Kolarov on a free. Alderweilder/Vertonghen/Savic/chiellini on a free. Eriksen/Modric/Matuidi (lol) available, on a free too.

As regards Europe, he was against. He was Eurosceptic. He wanted us out of the EU. I remember him saying this in the eighties and nineties. A reporter asked what he thought about a ""United States of Europe,"" and he said that would be completely different, because it would be completely democratic, with an elected president and congress. The EU has evolved since then.

One of my favourite things about Tony Benn was that he was worried about central government getting too powerful. He pointed out that the executive under Mrs. Thatcher, John Major, Tony Blair and others was becoming less and less accountable. Prime ministers he said tended to use and abuse the ""Royal Prerogative,"" the powers the Queen no longer uses, and trying to bypass parliament. There are dangers in this, as our constitution is unwritten. Tony Benn wanted a written constitution. He wanted to abolish the monarchy, to stop the P.M. from overstepping his or her powers.

Your point being?

&gt; Read about the game licensing system in China. 

Read about the USK system in Germany.

&gt; Blizz working with tencent is to sway the Chinese government, controlled by the CCP, to allow Blizz to license in China.

ActiBlizz, as a public company, will take any large investors money. Have you bothered to look into who actually owns shares? Many people here very likely are investors trough their 401k because ActiBlizz is listed in the S&amp;P 500.

Canada is a wonderful place if you've never been here- with the exception of a few Western provinces we don't have palm trees, but we've got culture and food to burn. 

My daughter (24) is a solo traveler- she went to Europe for the first time (solo) when she was 19.  She's been back 3 times (alone) since then.  Aside from a scary health issue (fortunately in Denmark), she's rocked traveling solo (despite my grey hairs that she's caused lol). She mostly stays in hostels- she's actually going to work in a Prague hostel for 4 months after Christmas. 

One resource that she's found really helpful is the [Solo Female Traveler Network](https://www.facebook.com/groups/thesolofemaletravelernetwork/) on Facebook.  There are women there from every country, who support each other.  They also have group travels every few months to places that aren't safe for women traveling alone. 

Know the places you are traveling to.  Are there warnings on your embassy's webpage, about health issues, safety, crime?  Take those seriously.  If you're American consider posing as a Canadian- there are a lot of countries who truly hate Americans.  

Don't go to a country until you have thoroughly researched how they treat women.  Can you safely take public transportation?  Do you have a cell phone plan that's workable for those areas?  Do you know your embassy's phone number?  What are the laws about bringing in antibiotics/birth control pills?  

If you're researching hostels and travel spots, look very closely at the ratings and comments.  ""They have scratchy sheets"" is very different than ""they wouldn't call an ambulance for me"". 

Research the actual cities that you want to go to- Bombay and Delhi are very different places.  

And just use common sense.  Yes, you're on an adventure, but know where you're going and what the risks are.  As far as you are able, have health insurance so that you can at least go to a hospital if you need to. 

And have fun, after you've considered all of the variables in the places that you're going. Be smart.  Have a cell phone that works wherever you are.  Know that you can access money.  Know which areas require tips for food/transportation/lodging and which don't.  Be aware that assholes and traffickers hang around airports and train stations no matter what country you're going to. 

Have someone that you regularly check in with.  For my daughter, it's either me, or her best friend, and we notify each other if we haven't heard from her in 24 hours.  Not because we're trying to track her movements, but because when she's traveling, many, many things can go wrong. It takes no time at all to set up your safety net- just make arrangements with one or two people to send an ""I'm fine"" message to.

And have fun.  I wish that I'd had my daughter's balls when I was her age- I always ""waited for the right time"" to travel.

That's not true. The current Republican government is still hunting him, so they're doing it as well. 

More importantly, what does this have to do with anything? Why would I care which party does it? 

&gt;and he's still practically allowed to say whatever he wants on YouTube, for as long as he doesn't reveal illegal information or publish secret documents.

Because he's in a foreign country. He's allowed to say those things, but by the Russian Government.

&gt;Sweden has it much more limited, with restricted magazine capacity and ammunition storage.  
&gt;  
&gt;In US the only guns hard/illegal to get are fully-automatic and explosive. If you exclude democratic/liberal states/cities.

I'm talking about Switzerland, first.

Second, what on earth do you mean ""If you exclude democratic/liberal states/cities"". Your argument is ""This is true, if you exclude the places where it isn't true"". In a lot of the US, you can't buy these type of weapons, or in some cases, almost any weapons at all to protect yourself.

Third, none of the Swiss limitations are limitation on the right to defend yourself. They're limitations for things you can do with a gun, but none of them increase your ability to defend yourself.

&gt;Getting advanced (degree) education is not a human right.

Why are you bringing up rights? We're taking about freedoms. The freedoms to get an education are infringed upon for people despite the choices they can make.

In addition, saddling victims with a loan they can't pay back isn't really an alternative, and community colleges often do charge.

The country would run out of money in less than a decade of freely hospitalising citizens.

Well that's not true. The US actually spends more **per person** on healthcare than other countries. It would save huge amounts of money switching.

&gt;Look at Russia. They are same as US in geopolitical sense - huge population, huge borders needing protection, external politics and other crap. And they have free healthcare and education. Except both of them are of shitty and unacceptable quality, because they don't have enough money to babysit every citizen.

**Disco Elysium**. 

Ba. Daca va stiti *videogame connoisseur*, nu doar asa, labareala pe Dota si Fortnait si niste Câsgo, nu exista scuza sa nu jucati Disco Elysium. Si daca sunti doar gamer d-ala de weekend care da si el un FIFA din cand in cand, nu ma intereseaza, cumparati Disco Elysium chit doar ca sa le dai bani la baietii aia care l-au facut, ca pur si simplu merita. Este la fel de sequel spiritual pentru Planescape Torment cum a fost Prey-ul din 2018 pentru System Shock. Este un dialogue-based RPG dar si point and click adventure cu o slana groasa de statsuri 99% fara impact in combat care de fapt e inexistent. Este cel mai role-playing-game joc, in adevaratul sens al cuvantului, pe care l-am jucat de ... ani? Nici nu stiu. Desi te arunca in rolul unui politist betiv amnesiac, iti da voie sa-l joci aprope oricum vrei. Poti sa fii prostul de care rade toata lumea ca nu isi mai stie numele si si-a pierdut pistolul, sa incerci sa tii o atitudine stoica lasand nimic sa scape pe sub masca preferand lasi oamenii confuzi, sau poate sa nu iti pese si sa fii cel mai annoying asshole care tocmai a posedat corpul saracului om si acu foloseste fleshbagul sa isi bata pula de toata lumea si de toti. 

Este absolut minunat. Art-ul este sublim, dialogul, vai de pula mea, dialogul, **writingul** in jocul asta este savuros, fresh, si fantastic. Va jur, n-am mai vazut un joc scris asa de bine de nici nu mai stiu cand. Toate skillurile le intelegi la ce s-ar folosi, chit ca au nume gen 'Savoir Faire', pe romaneste, poti sa ai skilluri de 'smecherie', de 'golaneala', de 'postura', de logica, de perceptie, de 'a fi pe faza', si astea sunt doar vreo cinci din dracu stie, treizeci sau cat are. Toate unice, si toate folosite, si atunci cand le folosesti, simti clar ca puteai doar tu cu personajul pe care tu l-ai modelat sa le faci. Exista niste RNG, dar e facut cu tact, si gameplayul nu isi bate pula de narativa; de fapt des lucreaza impreuna foarte bine.

Daca ar fi sa-i dau un tagline, asa ca site-urile mari de gaming, ar fi gen ""Joaca Disco Elysium ca sa te poti certa cu propriul sistem limbic"". PS, recomand sa-l jucati dupa cateva luni totusi, vad ca patchurile rezolva o futtona de chestii la fiecare update, toate importante, gen 'fix quest line x to not block progress'.

**God of War 4**. 

Il joc tarziu, ca am asteptat ca pretul la SHuri sa mai scada (80 ron cu un cod de Day One pre-folosit, boo). In primul rand e primul GoW pe care il joc, desi stiu seria dupa reputatie. Sistem de combat complex, cu combouri and stuff, huge boss battles, similar cu ce fac baietii cu spectacle fighters gen Devil May Cry si Bayonetta, doar ca mai western asa. God of War 4 are destul de multa complexitate in combat pe cat vrei sa aiba, dar mi se pare ca si ar trebui sa ceara putin mai mult de la jucator. Eu personal n-am fost niciodata foarte bun la spectacle fighters, si ma bucur ca GoW4 e putin mai spre classical western over-the-shoulder action games, decat e pe arena-based fighters.  Dar mi s-a parut usor sa ma blochez in niste patternuri, chiar si cand jocul imi dadea inamici noi sa-mi strice patternurile alea. Mai mult, si mi se pare ca des nu am pe ce sa pun experience points, ca fiecare skill des nu te face mai puternic per se, cat iti da mai multe optiuni, combouri, si varietate in combat; lucruri de care posibil sa nu ai nevoie si uneori chiar sa-ti strice feng-shui-ul daca accidental faci un long-press R2 in loc de R2 spamming cum faceai pana acum. Doar lu fi-tu, ""Boy"" asa cum ii zice Kratos in mod foarte memetic, denumit de ma-sa si Atreus, ii bagam skilluri ca avea niste straight damage upgrades si era destul de util in combat. Eu des dadeam cu toporul din spate sau mai saream asa intre ei cand mi se parea mie ca aveam prea multa viata. Dar e ok, am invatat destul dodge de la Dark Souls si se aplica si aici foarte bine skillurile alea. Dar banuiesc ca fanii hardcore ai seriei au fost dezamagiti daca asteptau un combat mai old-school traditional. (macar au scapat de multe din QTE-uri)

Interactiunea Atreus-Kratos e foarte misto facuta, si are o progresie foarte draguta desi inceata, si apreciez si ca plot-ul te duce foarte lin pe un drum pe care il poti vedea in fata, fara sa aiba n-spe twisturi care te debusoleaza mereu pentru nici un motiv real. Am putut sa ma asez comfortabil si sa tot merg pe el, omorand monstrii si ajungand pe taramuri magice lasand in spate cadavre si comori sparte. Pe de alta parte, jocul se vrea si un sandbox, dar sincer, stiu ca deblochez niste fast travel sau ceva la un moment dar, dar mi se pare ca e departe de a fi un sandbox real. E mult prea legat de plot, si mult prea linear, nelasandu-te sa te arunci in stanga si in dreapta aproape deloc. Nu am apreciat nici faptul ca intalnesti devreme 'Obstacole', in still usor clasic Metroidvania, pe care nu le poti sparge decat cu un skill pe care il iei mai incolo. Si astea sunt foarte strans legate de linearitate jocului. Nu as vrea sa fac backtracking, si dupa ce am luat skillul necesar, aproape 15-20 de minute, numai sa deschid ceva chest, si daca as tine minte unde e. Urasc backtrackingul asta inutil pentru un cacat de chest sau ceva cu reward inutil, motivul principal pentru care am si dat drop la seria noua Tomb Raider.

Nu ca harta te-ar ajuta cu ceva daca ai vrea sa te intorci, este absolut inutila, si am renuntat complet sa mai tin minte unde erau chestii pe care sa le unlockez mai incolo. Banuiesc sincer ca dupa end-game ti se da mai multe puncte de fast travel sau ceva, sau ca iti apar pe harta ce ai pierdut, sau marog, /ceva/, monstrii care isi iau respawn sau o socoteala d-asta (am vazut ceva item care avea nevoie de niste resurse de la un monstru pentru a fi craftata). Dar repet pentru moment, pare mai mult o linie cu niste boabe de struguri ici colo, mult mai mult decat pare un ciorchine de struguri in sine, si de unde te poti rasfira usor destul de departe. Si asta trebuie sa fie cea mai mare problema a mea cu jocul, dar e mai mult o chestie personala decat o problema de design.

Mai am de mentionat ca jocul pe PS4 Pro, desi e pe performance mode, are niste dipuri sub 60 fps din cand in cand sesizabile, si desi jocul arata foarte bine, nu pot sa zic ca merita sa aiba acele slow-downs pentru ce pune pe ecran.

Uh. **Neo Cab.**

Neo Cab l-am luat foarte light, dar mi-a dat niste pumni in suflet mai tare decat ma asteptam. Nu neaparat ca am ajuns sa imi para rau de personajele prezentate intr-un joc cu un fictional scifi dystopia unde joci ca o tipa care face 'uber'. Mai mult ca foloseste un sistem de dialog care e legat de un sistem de 'mood'. Poti sa fii hyped sau mellow, dar si feeling good or bad at the same time. Creaza o matrice de sentimente care uneori iti limiteaza ce poti sa zici. Si e frustrant, si usor prea aproape de realitate, cand jocul iti zice ca te simti foarte low si n-ai chef de cearta, vrei sa-i zici lu ala din spatele masinii ca e un bulangiu si sa e dea afara dupa ce ti-a vomat in masina... dar nu poti, nu mai ai de unde resurse. Asa ca taci si inghiti. E o diferenta masiva intre pur 'a putea', asa cum gen se intampla in Disco Elysium, ai 6 intr-un skill si 100% sansa de a il face, si 'nu poti acum pentru nici un alt motiv decat ca te simti intr-un fel anume'. Si asta se intampla si pe revers, poti sa fii foarte hyped si sa n-ai chef de discutii filozofoase sau heart-to-heart-uri.

Jocul are finaluri multiple, dar wow, sa obtin kind of 'bad' endingul, si la final sa am cea mai self-conscious si trista experienta cu el... desi jocul in sine e foarte bun, si are destul de mult replayability dat fiind ca niciodata nu ai destul timp sa faci curse cu toate NPC-urile din joc, si sa dormi la toate hotelurile avand alte vise care iti coloreaza cum incepi ziua, pur si simplu nu cred ca mai vroiam sa trec prin el din nou.

Cred ca e singurul joc pe care il recomand fara sa am neaparat sentimente pozitive fata de el. Obiectiv, e un joc indie restrans ca scope si doar ok ca gameplay. Subiectiv, probabil cel mai touching joc jucat anul asta.

The thing is Vader had no *reason* to make a Holocron. He wasn't training anyone with the serious intent of facing Palpatine until he met Luke. In the EU even when he had Starkiller he'd rather have let the kid die than face the Emperor together with him. He had no real reason to build on his legacy as he didn't think he could actually beat Palpatine and no vision of a future since his family died and everything he worked towards in his youth was gone.

Vader in Canon didn't overmuch care for the inquisitors. He didn't deal directly with young force sensitives but pawned that off to the Inquisitors or other specialists. Anyone else he trained wasn't a serious candidate for being a Sith. More importantly a Holocron could be a potential security risk.

He doesn’t have international football to navigate either. You can not compare his minuscule sample size of him definitely not playing “regularly” (more than 90% of minutes in any season he’s been at Utd with club or country) &amp; say that according to that evidence of his history that he’s not injury prone.

What's laughable is you not understanding the difference between not labeling him as injury prone and saying that he isn't injury prone. Whatever else you've gone on about there are your own arbitrary determinations.

&gt;He’s neither injury prone nor not injury prone. How do you not get that. I was merely indicating how you can interpret the transfermarkt info a number of ways.

Yes, we agree on that. Where did I say that he isn't injury prone? Quote me. I even said that he *could* be considered injury prone in the future if new data corroborates that assessment. What is it that you've been reading all this time? Seems like you wish to be argumentative for the sake of it.

&gt;For Example. Before he moved to Utd he played “regularly”. He was younger &amp; his body was adjusted to playing every week. He then moves to Utd &amp; over the period of several years his play time reduces significantly. So naturally like any human being his physical attributes could decline gradually as his motor function &amp; muscle memory hasn’t been used to playing 45+ games a season for over 3years. Then when Ole takes charge &amp; he is tasked with regular game time, he starts to play 85+minutes of every match 2x a week &amp; because his body hasn’t adapted fully it results in 2 significant injuries in less than 1 year.

Don't even bother with any of this pseudo-scientific speculation, mate. I'm a physician. It adds absolutely nothing to what I already know. If you've got a theory, link the appropriate scientific journal.

&gt;But what you can’t say is that from looking at his history of not even playing 1 full game a week for several years without playing international football that he is not injury prone.

False. He did not play less than 90 minutes a week for several years. Why bother commenting on the breakdown of his game time if you haven't even looked it up?

&gt;Like you have implied countless times.

Nope. I've only ever said that he shouldn't be labelled as injury prone. Which part of that poses the most difficulty for you? There are no further implications.

&gt;So that’s analysing his history which you keep banging on about which is in this case is irrelevant as he has not played nearly as much as vast amounts of players at top clubs across Europe over the same time period.

You've already agreed that there's no prerequisite number of minutes in determining whether a player is injury prone. At least keep up with the things you've said.

&gt;So recent history contradicts your implications that he is in fact not injury prone.

Again, any perceived implications are of your own making. My point is simply that the general perception surrounding Martial isn't accurate. The ""injury prone"" tag isn't befitting of his history, which is relatively unremarkable.

&gt;You choosing to look at his overall history at Utd &amp; say you’d rather focus on the parts where he barely played is quite frankly pathetic. The more I think about it, the more I want to poke holes in your logic.

I don't know how many times I'll have to repeat this, but here goes: He played the most minutes in his first season at Man Utd.

&gt;At this point you’re basically hoping he doesn’t get injured as he is a great fantasy differential. But there’s nothing to suggest on transfermarkt that he will do it like you’ve implied.

Aren't we hoping that none of our players will get injured? Martial is no different. **Just as there's nothing to suggest he won't get injured, there's nothing to suggest he will.** That's the entire point.

&gt;There’s also numerous examples of players not being injury prone &amp; then after a “significant” injury become injury prone. That is a very common occurrence.

This is an entirely different conversation. 

&gt;Anyways throw him in the side. Him &amp; Rashford looked deadly last game. Might as well take advantage of him when he is playing. Can always switch it up when needed.

Yep, did it since before the Norwich game.

&gt;It will be interesting to see how he copes through the winter month’s fixtures.

[],,ComplicatedSpirit,,,,[],,,,text,t2_2prucogp,False,False,[],"I think it has to do with two things:

1. Colonial guilt - the idea that because of Western imperialism, non-white, non-Christian, non-European cultures suffered under Western domination. Although it's obviously a valid concern, it often gets translated into ""Everything non-Western cultures do is good, and if it's not good, then it's just big exaggerations or stories we're making up about them to make them look bad (along the lines of the No True Scotsman argument), or we're thinking of it in the wrong way"".

2. The old ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"" adage. If wealthy, white, evangelical Christians oppose Islam, then the obvious reasoning for liberals is to support it. In this case, the practices and beliefs themselves aren't relevant. They can simply be rebranded for libfem taste. It's amazing what can be considered ""progressive"" when you slap words like ""empowering"" on it.....but we all knew that. 

I guess my ""peak libfem religious POV"" moment was when I attended a Comparative Religions class in college, circa 2007. We visited a mosque at one point. This was 6 years after 9/11 as opposed to nearly 20, so we had one rather confrontational student in our class on that trip (admittedly, he was like that on all the ""field trips""). One of the things he asked the imam is if it was true that the Quran promotes increasing punishment of disagreeable wives: first, stop talking to them; then, stop sleeping with them; then, hit them. The imam said that was true - ""But, it says you should only hit them lightly, with an instrument no larger than a toothbrush"". With wide eyes and a loud voice. Like we were all supposed to be impressed at how forward-thinking this was. ""Wow, my husband can only beat me *lightly?* Have women ever had it better?!"" And at the time, I was totally into the whole woke-ass libfem shit, and that one incident just haunted me. I'm supposed to think this is such a great religion that's being oppressed and misrepresented by western bigots for no reason, yet its holiest scripture - held in even higher esteem than most Christians do the Bible - is saying that if I make my husband angry, he can give me the silent treatment, then the cold shoulder, and then hit me. But I can't do the same to him. I cannot ""discipline"" him for disagreeing with me. And I spent more time than I should afterward trying to disprove what I'd just been told, but I was just told, over and over, when it came to that passage, that I should be cool with it, even be happy about how progressive it was, since my husband could apparently only hit me as a last resort and even then, not hard. It was really disappointing, and I ended up angry because I wanted it to be otherwise so bad, and I felt mislead for stupid political reasons.

The famine was caused by various things: 

The Japanese invasion of Burma denied precious rice imports to the region raising rice prices considerably,

The region was overpopulated and the amount of agriculture it did couldn't sustain itself so it was reliant on imported food, large numbers of refugees from Burma also added to the problem of overpopulation. 

Due to this, and the poverty in the region the people were already half starved as they could barely afford what food they could get before the famine, 

When prices raised to fund the war effort and the rice prices skyrocketed due to the Japanese invasion the average person couldn't afford any food. 

Add to this already terrible situation the natural disasters that ravaged bengal that year, A cyclone killed 14,000 people and destroyed farms, it also caused massive floods (perfect for mosquitos and malaria) and a rice crop disease that reduced the amount of rice that was harvested there, 

Hundreds of thousands of British and American troops were also based in India (along with the large Indian army) and this further inflated rice prices,
Military camps and airfields were also created on farmland reducing food output. 

Due to the threat of Japanese invasion through bengal the government decided it would be an excellent idea to initiate a preemptive scorched earth  policy around likely invasion points (it was a shit idea) This included moving food grains inland and destroying any boat or vehicle large enough to move 10 people. 

Provincial governments also set up trade barriers cutting off trade with other provinces. This is the most crucial policy that probably did the most damage, as Bengal couldn't import food from other Indian provinces. 

The Indian government then enacted a prioritised distribution system that meant most food had to go to the military, anyone working in industries that helped the military and the upper classes. 

Meanwhile the Indian colonial government kept requesting imports from the UK but this was not permitted due to the rather tricky situation in Europe and the massive nazi submarine offensive. Sending boats of food wasn't viable anyway, Between January 1942 and May if 1943 in the Indian Ocean alone 230 british cargo ships were sunk by the Axis powers totalling 873, 000 tons of shipping lost. If they sent boats they would likely not make it and the food would be wasted. 

The famine was made worse as someone had the bright idea of disposing of corpses in waterways- causing many many more to die from disease. 

In May 1943 Provincial trade barriers were abolished so aid could be sent from the rest of India, mostly from the Punjab. 15000 British soldiers and a bunch of military lorries were sent and took grain all over bengal. 

I would imagine Aid would have been sent as soon as the famine had started if it weren't for the strict wartime censorship in the UK that prevented the public knowing what was happening in bengal. When the public found out about it the famine was almost over, and as soon as the newspapers published photographs and stories of what was happening aid was sent and it ended. 

IMO: It was caused by a load of monumental fuckups made by a panicking government who feared imminent Japanese invasion, made worse by more fuckups in logistics, an unfortunate situation in Europe and a very unlucky number of natural disasters.

[],,Milkhemet_Melekh,1491723760.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_16x36n,False,True,[],"Worth noting for a second that a great many North American peoples were non-nomadic, and many of the ones we think of as nomads were not originally nomads. For example, Siouan peoples were likely agrarians of the Mississippian civilization, until environmental collapse brought that down and forced them to seek an alternative. The Puebloan peoples faced a similar issue, but instead just moved a bit and started farming again. This to say nothing of Mesoamerica, which managed to build metropoles without pack animals. They even built highways with relay stations so that messages could travel quite fast and travel could be fairly safe.

Meanwhile, the (original, and later adopted) nomads of North America *did* have a pack animal - they bred dog teams to drag sleds across mud, dirt, grass, and snow.

It just feels like the given answer is oversimplifying things a lot. The lack of an animal analogous to the horse was one of many things that contributed to the fall of indigenous american civilizations, but there was so much else at play. Their technology, ultimately, met their needs. Some invented gambesons similar to those in medieval Europe. The Pacific Northwest invented ironworking, the Andes bronzeworking. The Mesoamericans loved obsidian, and it was a very effective source since it could be made sharper than steel. They used their ingenuity to turn people into pack animals, via specially designed sacks that allowed people to carry heavier loads with lesser burdens. Many developed large towns and sprawling cities, and some developed writing and recordkeeping. Some issues of geography come up since the Americas are very lateral, while Eurasia is very horizontal - which is to say that Eurasia has arguably much easier means of transferring information and technology across continents via paths like the Silk Road, so anything invented in China can reach all the way to Europe and the Middle East and vice versa and verse vica. In the Americas, by contrast, the developments of the Andeans would struggle to reach the Mesoamericans, who would struggle to reach the Inuit. While some things (like Plains Indian Sign Language) managed to spread remarkably well, and we know of incredible long-distance trade networks in the Precolumbian Americas, it is simply more difficult to ferry technology with American geography, horses or no horses. Even the Europeans struggled with this. 

One big thing to remember is that at the time of contact, quite honestly, the European and American worlds weren't *that* far removed from one another. Yes, many used stone tools, but guns were still a very new concept to the Europeans and they weren't really that reliable. Cortes had only a handful of guns and horses throughout his army, and mostly relied on a single native ally (Tlaxcala, which provided around 300,000 soldiers) to do most of the fighting for him. The Incans, meanwhile, were disrupted because their emperor was met under false pretenses, kidnapped, and killed. This would throw *any* empire into chaos. The Byzantines lost a huge chunk of land when their emperor was captured on the field of battle, the English lost when Harold Godwinson took an arrow to the eye, etc. Any decently centralized and decently bureaucratic regime will suffer greatly when its central figure, its keystone, is pulled from the system suddenly and without preparation. All the same, the Neo-Inca State continued fighting Spain for decades after the fact. 

In short: Europe wasn't that far removed from Native America when first contact was made. Earlier in the Middle Ages, the Inuit had successfully driven out Viking colonization attempts (and made peace with others). It's a complex meshing of factors, and livestock/pack-animals were only a couple of them. I'd argue the power plays against the Inca and Aztec, based largely in peculiar diplomacy and betrayals, were more crucial for European success than technology was. With these footholds, Europe was able to essentially snowball its way to victory, while indigenous technological advancement was halted in the process. When natives picked up guns and horses, the European effort was too large and organized for it to do them much good.

The European advantage was, it seems, more social than technological.",True,False,False,,,0,1572661461,,False,0,{},f62kkr4,False,t3_dq2wc5,False,True,t1_f61soja,/r/HistoryMemes/comments/dq2wc5/better_burn_a_village_down_because_of_this/f62kkr4/,False,,1580571185,2,True,False,HistoryMemes,t5_2v2cd,r/HistoryMemes,public,0,

In your original comment, prior to the edit, you said that ""English speakers will be incredibly supportive of a 'universal language'"" so long as that language is English. Perhaps. Maybe the larger English speaking world would prefer English as a world lingua franca because it makes a whole lot more sense than, say, Swahili. But you'd be hard pressed to find the broader English speaking world claiming reverse racism (how that even applies to the broader English speaking world is somehwat of a mystery) for someone wanting to know their own mother tongue. In reference to this documentary, sure, the English prefer to stamp out other languages in the UK, but your original comment was directed at English speakers in general.

&gt;If you think that English people are willing to accept a foreign language as the new lingua franca then I'd just point you towards the amount of English people learning foreign languages.

I don't believe the English are willing to accept foreign languages as their lingua franca, on the contrary. And why would they? Aside from a few Scandinavian nations (i.e. English is a de facto official language of Sweden), most nations in Europe staunchly cling to their own languages. 

&gt;Finally, if you're sole objection is that I'm using the term English ""poorly"" then fair enough. In Britain, it's pretty clear that English refers to people from England but maybe I was arrogant to assume that's widely understood.

Again, your original comment was direct at English speakers, not simply English people, so that is cause for confusion.

I know someone who is a born and bred Kiwi Indian who still at the time of marriage has to go back to India to marry someone. It is culturally just the done thing and he never questions it. Nations with a lot of Indians also has a lot of arranged marriage with many actually returning back to India to find suitable partners.

As far as I can tell it is not forced marriage ( or at least none of my Indian friends who are married via arranged marriage sees it as forced ). It seems the modern tradition is that when the person wants to get married they go to an agency themselves, get paired up and then get married ( yes, there seems to be something like match makers who are hired to do this, and usually this is instigated by the person who wishes to get married ). The parents nowadays are just there to make sure that the partner is approved by the parents as well as the dowry paid. 

The Indic notion of legitimate marriage is in fact quite different to many other culture’s notion of marriage, though noting that every culture has a subtly different idea of what marriage is compared to other cultures ( which also results in subtly different idea of what constitute a family and legitimate offsprings )

For example, a legitimate reason for divorce in Chinese culture is extramarital affair ( even traditionally ). The other legitimate reason is childlessness. One off adultery would both be seen as trivial reasons for divorce in Indian culture ( who believes this needs to be worked over and a promise that this would never happen again ) and Western culture generally ( who despite being increasingly secular still has this hangover from the Christian period where extramarital affair is something that can be worked over ). The second is seen as even more absurd to the Indians and Europeans ( who will simply adopt )

This difference however is because Indic sees marriage as expansion of one family ( the paternal side ), Europeans see marriage as union of two people ... whereas Chinese sees marriage as a legitimate foundation to extend the bloodline ( one’s own ) and to provide a stable foundation for the next generation to grow up.

Anything which threatens this threatens marriage.

There are still mass shootings in Europe even though guns are banned. By the way, which machine guns are you talking about? I guarantee those people suffering from knife crime and the police fighting said knife crime and other crimes are in favour of arming yourself. Liberals are also to blame here because they aren't strict enough on criminals. When you give a person a few months in prison or community service for knife crime, don't be surprised if they commit the crime again. That's why the Sharia is the best. The punishment fits the crime. 

Capitalism, especially the system practised by many western countries, literally takes advantage poor people in their own countries and abroad. Look at the people in Bangladesh, India, etc who are literal slaves. Riba is the reason why so many people are in debt and cannot dig themselves out. That's the kind of system both liberals and Conservatives agree upon. I never claimed not to do anything about climate change, but we don't believe the planet will be here forever like the non-Muslims do. It's also easy to talk about how you'll do everything to fight climate change until you have issues heating your home, cooking, getting to places, etc. Interesting video about recycling here https://youtu.be/c8aVYb-a7Uw. At least a wall be some sort of deterrent. Even if you disagree on a wall, shouldn't more be done in terms of securing the border to stop this issue? I didn't equate them, I said Antifa is also pretty bad. How many people have they attached and caused injuries too just because of a disagreement? No, I'd never speak like that as a Muslim, but you're crazy to believe that most non-Muslim men don't speak like this behind closed doors. Weren't a few prominent democratic figures caught in many scandals like groping women on camera, adultery, and other immoral acts? Liberal Hollywood is full of these kinds of people. I'm sure if you dug deep into Beto's past, Bernie's past, etc, you'd find something questionable, but they aren't a prominent TV figure like Trump.

It actually is because they're both harming our community. How can you say people who say voting is Haram are ""backwards""? Is the Sharia ""backwards"" and something we shouldn't strive to? It's a damned of you do and damned if you don't situation. I seriously doubt you'd respect the opinion of any person who voted for Trump. Because we want what's best for our children, community, society? That's why each issue has to be thought about carefully. You're kind of forced into advocating and supporting it. If you don't and speak out against it, you're shunned. Just like that baker who didn't want to make a cake for a same sex couple. Because in their minds, a Muslim is that person who barely prays, fornicates, drinks, doesn't wear Hijab, supports gay marriage and does all things which are common in western society. If you're against these things or don't do them, you're seen as the ""extremist"", ""fanatic"". Look at the people they promote in society as the typical Muslim. People like Aziz Ansari, Hassan Minhaj, the two Muslim congresswomen, etc. I've never seen an unapologetic Muslim who does their prayers, doesn't do and expose their major sins, doesn't believe in gay marriage, and doesn't give up their religion for liberalism promoted. That's what I mean when I say ""cultural Muslim"". There's hardly any mention of God nowadays and people make fun of you for believing in the concept of a God.

&gt; 
&gt; 

You're focusing on only one detail. Yes, the Okhrana was a later development, but the entire aristocratic structure of pre-communist Russia was autocratic in a way that most European governments hadn't been in centuries. In England, for instance, yes, there was a King, but the nobility had rights and a parliament. The Boyars never gained that independence. Czarist Russia was one of the few true autocracies left of all the old monarchies.

&gt; If you ignore the massive purges, and no the Okhrana is not the KGB(wasn't called that until 1954). The Okhrana was completely disbanded with the end of Imperial rule.

I'm not saying the Okhrana was literally the same people as the KGB. I'm saying that Stalin basically just recreated the same system with his own people. Like abused children who go on to abuse their own children, they fell back on the patterns that they had been raised under, not realizing how toxic those patterns were.

By the way, I didn't say democracy was impossible. I said that the problem was that the Russians didn't value the principles of democracy and were only imitating the forms because culturally, they just don't seem to get why their government shouldn't be corrupt. Culturally, they aren't really comfortable with the idea of a free press. So they end up with governments that ostensibly claim to be democratic and egalitarian, but they just keep recapitulating the same authoritarian structures.

when we got an email from the daughter of the man who would be my grandmother's brother, there was a photo attached. it was incredible - like my great grandmother as a man. looked identical to what his mom (my great grandmother) looked like. there was no doubt in my mind after that, but then submitting our DNA tests sealed the deal as we of course, came up related.

it was an incredible story to uncover and great to connect with him and his family but of course, sad as well. he hadn't had the best life as a child and young adult (he knew he wasn't the biological child of his adoptive parents and it was a cloud over the family in a way, he never felt accepted or truly loved) and i wished he'd been a part of our family to feel the love and togetherness i knew growing up with my grandmother and great grandmother. i wondered what being in his biological family would've changed about his life. i wondered what my grandmother would've thought, i wondered what kind of pain and horrible emotions my great grandmother must've experienced as a result of this awful situation.

we don't really know the circumstances of his birth. the father listed on the birth certificate was tracked down by the family that contacted me on ancestry, but that man's family (he is of course long dead) basically called them liars and said they must have it wrong, that their relative would've told them about a baby given up. but the DNA tests match up :(

In the before time, back when C band (a different set of radio frequencies) was big in the US and elsewhere, we had like 3 meter dishes with massive linear actuators to move them from your set top box to point them at different satellites. This was around the time when cable systems were specific to communities or even village size groupings of houses or trailers or whatnot. It was a pre-internet wild west of wild feeds and backhauls and free network tv and races to scramble/descramble content. 

Then hughes/DSS/etc all came out with this one compact Ku dish about a meter in size that had ""strong"" encryption and could tune hundreds of channels. It killed the general public's interest in most of the satellite stuff in the US because one dish you can buy at best buy and then point once and leave in place till it's obsolete and you buy another is way easier than having to take your TV outside, put it on a ladder while you stand on another and use it to figure out if you have your dish adjusted right while you work on a dodgy linear actuator or a ceased joint on a metalic mesh dish or whatnot. 

In Europe and the middle east where there wasn't just one language, the providers weren't as fast to put up birds to do the same. Also, lots of smaller networks want more eyeballs for advertisers more than they want paid subscriptions. So FTA TV caught on big there, also eventually using the 1 meter Ku dishes. It caught on in China and South America too. 

Now you can buy all sorts of commodity priced hardware to watch FTA and there's a bit of an underground in the US of cord cutters/hackers/nostalgia seekers/etc using it. It's a bit of a hard community to break into because when stuff gets too big, nice things we have get turned off. A lot of west coast people had free satellite based ABC/NBC/Fox/etc for a few years till it became known via internet buzz that the Alaska TV stations were using an unencrypted Ku channel to relay their content to the remote terrestrial transmitters. 

Seeing as it's all built on commodity hardware, it's sadly cheaper enough to buy 2-3 sets of the dish hardware and set them up than to buy a more complex motorized dish to point at the various satellites you want to watch.

There's a reason the European Commission opened a formal antitrust investigation into insurance Ireland to assess whether it is operating as a cartel. Insurance fraud exists and is disgraceful but counts for a relatively small amount of profits earned in the Industry. The issue is being blown out of proportion as a means of influencing the public. The endgame is to distract from the real fraud being perpatrated against the customer on behalf of the industry itself.

No, that's not how the discussion started. See, this is why it's quite difficult to argument with you, since you are trying to have a discussion on things I didn't say to make an argument against something I never actually posited as an argument to begin with. 

I said that in a globalized economy, a multicultural society with people with foreign roots living somewhere is a logical outcome. I said that you would also find a mixed multicultural society in say Bruges in the 1300s or Antwerp in the 1500s because both those cities were at the time big and important ports in the European trading-network and thus relatively ""globalized"". 

Somebody then said he didn't feel that was mixed because it was Europeans only with low cultural distance, I then replied that it was far from Europeans only (because you would also come across Northern Africans, Africans, Indians and even Asians, though obviously not in the same numbers as now) and that *and this is actually a crucial part of the argument that you keep ignoring* :

&gt; . Add to that that saying there was a low cultural distance between Europeans in the Middle Ages is silly if you think the cultural distances between migrants now are high (and even a cursory glance on sources about say German immigration towards ports like Rotterdam show that that's very optimistic, hell, German, take Flemish to Dutch and read Bredero's Spaanse Brabander).

I never pretended we were only talking about non-Europeans and I specifically said that I didn't think they were the crux of the argument. You keep bringing it back to that because you have some sort of stake in a) there not being any and b) if there were, they were slaves. We've since established that we can find evidence of non-Europeans in the Middle Ages in various roles, from ambassadors to ecclesiastical professions to merchants to soldiers.

He said that there weren't *any*, I cite:

&gt; It was Europeans only

I said that that wasn't true and that there were more than you'd think. Furthermore *and most importantly* projecting our idea of Europeanness on the Middle Ages and pretending that Bruges is mono-cultural because Portuguese and Italians are just like us is just wrong.

&gt; You didn’t prove that at all. 

Actually, I did, you just dismiss the evidence (or didn't read the links I gave).

&gt; Also weird a history student doesn’t know about the prosecution of Jews, like multiculteral means people with different cultures living among eachother. 

Multicultural at no point means conflict free, it means that there are people of various cultures living in the same place, that's all it means. 

&gt; Having to hide your religion or customs from others out of fear isn’t really living in a multicultural society in my opinion.

The Prime Minister last night dismissed a call by Mr Farage jointly  to secure  a “big majority” for Leave in House of Commons by standing  aside in 150 seats that would “never” vote Conservative for “cultural  reasons”.

Mr Farage threatened to field candidates in every constituency bar  Northern Ireland if the Tories refuse, a ""kamikaze"" strategy derided by  insiders as an attempt to reconcile differences between a faction which  hates Mr Johnson's deal and another which believes the Brexit Party has  served its purpose.

The ultimatum also provoked a withering backlash from senior  Eurosceptic Conservatives, who accused the Brexit Party leader of  putting his “ego” and his party’s prospects ahead of the national  interest.

Asked if he would consider any sort of pact, Mr Johnson told the BBC:  “Voting for any other party simply risks putting Jeremy Corbyn into  Number 10.

“And the problem with that is that his plan for Brexit is basically yet more dither and delay.” 

At a launch event in London, Mr Farage promised to fight the Conservatives across mainland Britain unless Mr Johnson scraps his [withdrawal agreement](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/11/01/donald-trump-entirely-wrong-boris-johnson-deal/) and promises to secure a Canada-style free trade agreement by July, or leave on World Trade Organisation terms.

Mr Farage  criticised the Prime Minister’s deal as “not Brexit”, saying it saddled  the UK with “all the burdens of EU membership with no say whatsoever”.

“Please don’t doubt that we are ready. Don’t underestimate our determination or our organisation,” Mr Farage warned.

He added: “We have enough money right now for a fully funded election campaign.”

He set a  deadline of November 14, the last date on which candidates can submit  their nomination papers, but promised to parade 500 potential candidates  in Westminster on Monday as a show of intent.

The announcement followed reports that senior Brexit Party figures [favoured fielding as few as 20 candidates](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/10/30/brexit-party-could-help-tories-general-election-not-fighting/) to avoid splitting the leave vote.

The strategy has prompted an internal row, with one senior source  saying: “It's a kamikaze approach - it's because there is real anger  with the Tories for failing to reject the deal and there is a split in  the Leave camp on whether to stand in every seat or target a small  number.""

It follows analysis of polling data by Electoral Calculus which  estimates that the Conservatives could fail to secure almost 90  battleground constituencies if the pro-leave vote is split.

Steve  Baker, leader of the European Research Group, said: “I am no more  willing to be bullied by Nigel Farage than anyone else into acting  against my best understanding of then national interest. I’m now at a  loss to know what Nigel Farage wants to achieve.”

Meanwhile  Mark Francois, one of the 28 “Spartan” MPs who voted Theresa May’s deal  three times, said: “I think Nigel screwed it up.

“If you genuinely want to work with another political party, you  don’t go on live national television and call them liars, which is what  he did.

“He said Boris’s deal doesn’t take us out of the European Union - that’s not true.”

He continued: “Nigel is a very talented politician, but anyone who  works with him will tell you he’s often his own worst enemy, and his ego  has got the better of him.”

But Mr Farage dismissed criticism that his approach would help Labour as “lazy thinking”.

He argued that the same had been said of UKIP at the 2015 election,  but that his former party had in fact helped David Cameron secure his  majority by damaging Labour.

Writing in The Telegraph, he said a ""crucial"" group of around five million Labour Leave voters are the key to the election.

He  promised to aggressively target Labour-held leave-backing seats regions  such as the North East, East Midlands, and South Wales.

But shadow cabinet Minister told The Daily Telegraph the Brexit Party’s announcement was a “gift” for Labour.

“Votes that might have gone to the Tories will now go to the Brexit Party,” they said.

Mr Farage  also suggested that, in the certain absence of a formal pact between  his party and the Conservatives, non-aggression agreements could be  struck at local or regional levels. 

He spoke of “very interesting” areas such as the Midlands, singling out Warwickshire in particular.

However, any Tory member found to be advocating a policy at odds with  the Conservative manifesto would be likely to face suspension.

A Brexit Party source said: ""There are still concerns in the party  that this ploy to make Boris abandon the deal won't work. We may end up  just being a protest vote without power.""

A spokesman for the party said: “There are 14 days until close of  nominations, but we are working now as if we were standing across the  country. As Nigel pointed out there are conversations happening across  the country.""

Well, my first question would be- what do I get for 30k? Do you get any assets or just business contacts?

I had a similar offer coming in earlier, it's different business but the idea was that business sellers had contacts and contracts with lots of companies that order some goods. The business makes good yield but by buying it I would not get any assets. 

So the risk here is that if you pay 30k and don't get anything but contact its big risk. How people will react to you taking over, can they easily shift from you to other companies? 

If you would provide more info I can share with you my thoughts on why I declined an offer that also was very very good.

Not precise but I had offered to buy for 1,5kk and profit after tax was around 300-350k per year.

It began with a small guard unit known as the Saal-Schutz (""Hall Security"") made up of NSDAP volunteers to provide security for party meetings in Munich. In 1925, Heinrich Himmler joined the unit, which had by then been reformed and given its final name. Under his direction (1929–45) it grew from a small paramilitary formation during the Weimar Republic to one of the most powerful organizations in Nazi Germany. From 1929 until the regime's collapse in 1945, the SS was the foremost agency of security, surveillance, and terror within Germany and German-occupied Europe.

Labour's Plan for Brexit

The Tories have had three years to get Brexit sorted. They have failed. It’s time to take the decision out of the hands of politicians. Our position is clear: let the people have the final say on Brexit.

A Labour government will immediately legislate for a referendum once elected.

 

Why do we need a second referendum?

No one knew what a deal with the EU would look like back in 2016. A No Deal Brexit was dismissed completely by leading Leave campaigners, including by Boris Johnson.

Britain is divided. Boris Johnson’s Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats have taken extreme positions on Brexit, both won’t do anything to heal this division.

Boris Johnson’s Conservatives are pushing the country towards No Deal.  This would be a disaster for British jobs and our NHS. It would lead to a race-to-the-bottom in our rights and protections to get a one-sided trade deal with Donald Trump.

The Liberal Democrats have taken an undemocratic decision too and would cancel Brexit. But the Liberal Democrats can’t win an election. They make Boris Johnson’s disastrous No Deal even more likely.

Labour is the only party that can and will deliver a public vote. Labour is the only party that can unite Britain and move it forward with a plan for real change. Labour trusts the people to decide.

What will happen in a second referendum?

A second referendum won’t be a re-run of 2016. This time the choice will be between leaving with a sensible deal or remaining in the European Union.

A Labour government will negotiate a sensible deal within three months of being elected. It will be based on the things we have long advocated and discussed with the EU; trade unions and businesses, including a new customs union, a close single market relationship and guarantees of rights and protections.

Within six months of being elected we will put that deal to a public vote, alongside remain. Two clear options, both agreed with the EU – no false promises or bluster. Labour will then carry out whatever the people decide.

Labour’s position is simple: Labour trusts the people to decide.

Nobody but Labour will get Brexit sorted and bring our country together because years of division over Brexit has become a barrier to delivering the real change this country needs.

To do that we need an economy that works for the many not just the few at the top. Labour has a plan to do just that.

Boris Johnson, o primeiro-ministro conservador, definiu sua campanha como um levante do “povo”, pelo [brexit](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/especial/2019/brexit/), contra a “elite” que impede uma ruptura radical com a União Europeia (UE).

 Os liberais britânicos —isto é, a maioria do Partido Conservador e o Partido do Brexit, de Nigel Farage— transformaram-se numa seita anti-Europa. É mais um sintoma da degradação do pensamento liberal.

 Os liberais britânicos giraram 180 graus. Entre 1985 e 1994, quando o francês Jacques Delors conduziu as negociações que concluíram a arquitetura do Mercado Único Europeu, eles ocuparam a linha de frente na batalha contra as resistências protecionistas nacionais. Hoje, renegam o que fizeram, entrincheirando-se num nacionalismo de nítida coloração populista.

 No Foro da Liberdade, meses atrás, escutei as razões de um fanático do brexit, o economista Andy Duncan. Ele acusava a então primeira-ministra, Theresa May, e o líder opositor Jeremy Corbyn de subserviência à “elite europeia”. E, desafiando o que sugere o registro histórico, assegurava que Margaret Thatcher teria completado sem demora o serviço do brexit.

  Tive, então, que recordar à plateia brasileira o primeiro plebiscito sobre o brexit, realizado em 1975, quando a conservadora Thatcher defendeu a adesão à Comunidade Europeia e o trabalhista Corbyn adotou posição contrária.

 O economista ultraliberal reproduziu os discursos de campanha de Farage, que classificou como seu “herói”. Estados grandes representariam, invariavelmente, ameaças às liberdades dos cidadãos. A Europa ficaria melhor se fragmentada em microestados como Andorra, Liechtenstein ou Monaco. A UE seria um superestado opressor, uma burocracia “globalista” determinada a suprimir as liberdades britânicas. 

 Duncan situa-se numa franja extrema do espectro partidário, mas seus argumentos esclarecem a gramática política que impulsiona o brexit. A “liberdade” dos modelares microestados de Duncan é a liberdade de circundar impostos: os três são paraísos fiscais.

 O brexit veicula a utopia reacionária de rebaixar os padrões sociais e ambientais britânicos, pela ruptura com as regras comuns europeias. Na sua nova encarnação, os liberais sonham com uma Inglaterra bucaneira: um Chipre com armas nucleares.

 Os grandes Estados europeus são diversos e relativamente abertos à imigração. A campanha do brexit concentrou-se na ideia de retomar o controle das fronteiras, abolindo o livre trânsito de cidadãos europeus e erguendo uma muralha frente aos fluxos imigratórios. A “liberdade” de Farage e Johnson é a liberdade de definir a nação à base do sangue. O brexit veicula a utopia nativista de um retorno aos tempos dourados de uma Pequena Inglaterra exclusivamente branca e anglicana.

 A proteção das liberdades públicas e políticas foi a mola que, lá atrás, quando assentava a poeira da guerra mundial, impulsionou o projeto europeu. Na origem da UE encontram-se os imperativos de evitar o ressurgimento do nacionalismo alemão e de traçar uma fronteira geopolítica diante do bloco soviético.

 A Europa fragmentária idealizada pelos maníacos do brexit é o cenário estratégico perfeito para a Rússia, o maior dos Estados europeus. Em 2014, Farage nomeou Vladimir Putin como “o líder mundial que mais admiro”. Há um claro motivo político para o voto pró-europeu de Thatcher em 1975.

 O Reino Unido navega rumo às águas turbulentas do brexit, um ato voluntário de autoagressão poucas vezes visto na história das nações. Os liberais convertidos ao nacionalismo xenófobo pilotam o navio, mas partilham a responsabilidade com os trabalhistas, que se recusaram a tentar mudar o curso.

A mãe dele dormia. E foi por obra do acaso, 17 anos depois, que a criança roubada descobriu sua verdadeira identidade.

Era o primeiro dia de aula na Zwaanswyk High School, na Cidade do Cabo. Miché Solomon começava o que seria o seu último ano na escola.

Mas aquele janeiro de 2015 ficaria para sempre marcado em sua memória.

Ela tinha 17 anos. Logo que chegou à escola, seus colegas de classe vieram lhe falar de uma nova aluna, Cassidy Nurse, três anos mais jovem. 

O motivo? Na opinião deles, Miché e Cassidy eram praticamente idênticas.

Miché não deu muita atenção aos comentários, mas tudo mudou quando cruzou com Cassidy no corredor mais tarde. Miché diz ter sentido uma conexão instantânea inexplicável.

""Quase senti que a conhecia"", diz ela. ""Foi tão assustador, não conseguia entender por que estava me sentindo daquela forma.""

   Direito de imagem Mpho Lakaje   Image caption  Miché Solomon hoje   Apesar da diferença de idade, Miché e Cassidy começaram a passar muito tempo juntas.

""Eu dizia: 'Ei, menininha!' E ela dizia: 'Ei, maninha!'"", lembra Miché. ""Às vezes eu ia ao banheiro com ela e dizia: 'Deixe-me escovar seu cabelo, deixe-me arrumar um pouco da sua maquiagem'.""

Quando alguém perguntava a Miché e Cassidy se elas eram irmãs, as duas brincavam: ""Não sabemos — talvez em outra vida!""

Então, um dia, as duas garotas tiraram uma selfie juntas e mostraram para as amigas. Alguns perguntaram a Miché se ela tinha certeza de que não havia sido adotada. ""Não! Que loucura!"", dizia ela.

Então Miché e Cassidy foram para casa e também mostraram a foto para suas famílias. Lavona, a mãe de Miché, comentou sobre a semelhança das meninas. 

Michael, o pai de Miché, disse que reconheceu a nova amiga de sua filha — o pai de Cassidy tinha uma loja de eletrodomésticos onde às vezes ele fazia compras.

Mas os pais de Cassidy, Celeste e Morne Nurse, não se desgrudaram da fotografia. Disseram a Cassidy que tinham uma pergunta para Miché, e quando as duas garotas voltaram a se encontrar, Cassidy finalmente abriu o jogo: ""Você nasceu em 30 de abril de 1997?""

""Eu disse: 'Por quê? Você está me perseguindo no Facebook?'"", relembra Miché.

Cassidy garantiu a Miché que ela não a estava perseguindo, só queria saber quando Miché nascera. Para a surpresa dela, a resposta de Miché foi afirmativa.

Semanas depois, enquanto assistia à aula de matemática, Miché foi convocada de repente para a sala do diretor, onde duas assistentes sociais estavam esperando por ela. Foi quando Miché ouviu pela primeira vez a história de uma menina de três dias chamada Zephany Nurse, que havia sido sequestrada no Hospital Groote Schuur, na Cidade do Cabo, há 17 anos, e que nunca fora encontrada.

Miché ouviu a história, sem entender o motivo. Em seguida, as assistentes sociais explicaram que havia fortes evidências de que Miché poderia ser a criança que havia sido roubada.

Na tentativa de esclarecer o que considerava um mal-entendido, Miché explicou que não havia nascido no Hospital Groote Schuur e sim no Hospital Retreat, a 20 minutos de carro dali. Era isso que estava escrito em sua certidão de nascimento, disse ela. 

No entanto, as assistentes sociais responderam que não havia nenhum registro de seu nascimento lá.

Apesar de achar que tudo não passava de uma grande confusão, Miché concordou em fazer um teste de DNA.

""Acreditava muito na mãe que me criou - ela nunca mentiria para mim, principalmente sobre quem eu sou e de onde eu venho"", diz Miché. ""Então, eu tinha certeza de que o teste de DNA daria negativo"".

     Image caption  Lavona Solomon em sua casa com Miché   Mas, para a sua surpresa, os resultados confirmaram as suspeitas: Miché Solomon e Zephany Nurse, o bebê roubado do Hospital Groote Schuur em 1997, eram a mesma pessoa.

""Fiquei em estado de choque"", diz Miché. ""Minha vida ficou de cabeça para baixo.""

A história do bebê roubado, agora uma jovem quase na vida adulta, sendo encontrada quase por acaso quase duas décadas depois, foi destaque no noticiário da África do Sul e de todo o mundo.

A partir daí, a vida de Miché mudou completamente.

As autoridades disseram que Miché não poderia voltar para casa — em três meses, ela completaria 18 anos e poderia tomar suas próprias decisões. Mas, naquele momento, tinha que ficar em uma casa segura.

Então, Miché recebeu notícias ainda piores. Lavona Solomon, a mulher que acreditava ser sua mãe, havia sido presa.

     Image caption  Miché, então com oito meses, com Michael, que acreditava ser seu pai biológico   ""Meu mundo acabou"", lembra Miché. ""Precisava dela. Precisava perguntar: 'Por quê? O que está acontecendo?' Fiquei perplexa quando soube ser filha de outra pessoa"".

Miché estava presente quando o marido de Lavona, Michael — o homem que Miché considerava seu pai — foi interrogado pela polícia.

""Pude ver a tensão no rosto dele, pude ver seus olhos cheios de sangue e fiquei com muito medo"", diz Miché.

A polícia queria saber se ele fazia parte da trama de sequestro.

""Meu pai é um cara tranquilo e gentil"", diz Miché. ""Mas ele é a minha rocha, meu herói, meu pai, meu exemplo. E aquele policial o fazia parecer o contrário de tudo o que sempre imaginei. Meu pai dizia: 'Não, eu não fiz isso. Miché é minha filha — como ela pode não ser minha filha? Eu não participei disso.'""

A polícia nunca encontrou provas de que Michael Solomon soubesse que Miché fora tirada de seus pais biológicos sem permissão e ele acabou libertado. Em sua defesa, ele alegou que Lavona estava grávida de Miché.

No entanto, as autoridades acreditam que Lavona tenha sofrido um aborto espontâneo. Ela, então, teria roubado a menina e fingido que havia dado à luz a ela.

Lavona acabou detida, acusada de sequestro e falsidade ideológica. Seu julgamento ocorreria nos meses seguintes. 

Embora Celeste e Morne Nurse tenham tido mais três filhos, eles nunca pararam de procurar sua primeira filha, Zephany, e comemoravam seu aniversário todos os anos — mesmo depois de se divorciarem.

   Direito de imagem Huisgenoot/Noncedo Mathibela   Image caption  Celeste Nurse (à esq.) e sua segunda filha, Cassidy       No entanto, durante todo esse tempo, sua filha crescia por perto. A casa dos Solomons fica a apenas 5 km da dos Nurses — quando criança, Miché corria pelo campo em frente à casa dos pais biológicos, enquanto Michael jogava futebol.

Agora, após 17 anos, as orações da família Nurse foram atendidas. Miché se reuniu com seus pais biológicos em uma delegacia rodeada por assistentes sociais.

""Eles me abraçaram, me apertaram e começaram a chorar"", diz. 

Mas Miché não se sentia confortável.

""Fiquei pensando: 'Tenho que entender o sofrimento dessas pessoas. É triste, mas não sentia nada, não senti falta deles todo esse tempo"".

Miché estava numa encruzilhada emocional. De um lado, seus pais biológicos — com os quais não tinha nenhum tipo de ligação — queriam recuperar o tempo perdido. Do outro, a mulher que chamava de mãe estava atrás das grades. 

   Direito de imagem Getty Images   Image caption  Lavona Solomon (com rosto coberto) chega para seu julgamento em fevereiro de 2016   O julgamento de Lavona Solomon no tribunal superior da Cidade do Cabo começou em agosto de 2015. Tanto Miché quanto seus pais biológicos estavam lá para ouvir o testemunho de Lavona.

Durante o julgamento, Lavona Salomon negou ter cometido o crime. Falou sobre sua vontade de ser mãe, seus vários abortos espontâneos e seu desespero de adotar um filho. Lavona disse que recebeu Miché de uma mulher chamada Sylvia, que estava fazendo tratamento de fertilidade. Sylvia teria dito a Lavona que o bebê pertencia a uma jovem que não estava interessada em mantê-lo e queria que o bebê fosse adotado. Mas não havia evidências de que Sylvia existisse.

Além disso, quase duas décadas após o incidente, uma testemunha identificou Lavona como a mulher que diz ter visto vestida de enfermeira levando Zephany do hospital onde Celeste dormia.

   Direito de imagem Getty Images   Image caption  Morne Nurse, pai biológico de Zephany, deixa corte após veredito   O tribunal concluiu que Lavona era culpada.

Em 2016, Lavona Salomon foi condenada a 10 anos de prisão por sequestro, fraude e violação do Estatuto das Crianças. 

Também foi criticada pelo juiz por não demonstrar nenhum remorso durante o julgamento.

""Senti como se tivesse morrido"", diz Miché. ""Pensava comigo mesma: 'Como vou lidar com isso? Como vou passar a vida sem a mãe que tive todos os dias da minha vida?'""

Alguns meses depois, Miché visitou Lavona na prisão e pôde falar com ela pela primeira vez desde que recebeu a visita das assistentes sociais em sua escola.

""Quando a vi pela primeira vez, um vidro nos separava. Não pude tocá-la"", diz Miché. ""Vi minha mãe com uniforme de prisioneira e isso partiu meu coração. Chorei sem parar.""

Miché realmente queria saber a verdade, descobrir o que havia acontecido no dia em que Lavona a levara da mãe no hospital.

""Disse a ela: 'Saber que não sou seu sangue — que realmente vim de outra pessoa, e que você lhes roubou da possibilidade de me criar, mudando todo o meu destino — me machuca. Como posso acreditar em sua palavra quando você mentiu para mim, dizendo que sou sua filha? Você quebrou minha confiança. Tem que me falar a verdade se quiser continuar a me ver.

""E ela respondeu: 'Um dia eu vou te contar.' Ela diz que não me roubou, mas acho que está mentindo.""

That's what caused me to become an evangelical Christian at age 18, even though my family was not terribly religious and we never went to church. However, I was raised in a very Catholic community, and attended a few Catholic schools growing up. I had been immersed in Christian lore, presented to me as the absolute truth, and had never heard any messaging that really challenged it.

Cultural immersion gives the Christian evangelist a shortcut when ""witnessing"" to someone. The assumption is that the target was similarly raised in a culture that reveres Christianity, and that the target already knows many significant details of the story, and none of the criticisms.

When a Christian missionary goes to a country that Christianity has not penetrated, that missionary often has to spend decades before seeing the first convert. Why? Because those folks *don't* know in their heart that the Christian god is real, and they have to be convinced of it.

The reason that you even know anything about Christianity is because of two things:

1. Constantine's embrace of Christianity as the state religion of the Roman empire
2. European societies that similarly made Christianity the state religion for most of the past 2,000 years

Christianity was forced on people, culturally, who didn't know any better.

2. So there's this region called Macedonia which was part of the Ottoman Empire at the beginning of the 20th century. The Empire was falling apart and the Orthodox Christian states that formed in the Balkans (i.e Greece, Bulgaria, Montenegro and Serbia) wanted to force it from the Balkans and conquer its remaining territory. 

In 1912 they started the 1st Balkan War and conquered a lot of territory but couldn't agree on how to divide Macedonia. Southern (i.e Aegean) Macedonia was populated by Greeks, Turks, Jews and Slavs, eastern (i.e Pirin) Macedonia was populated by Slavs and northwestern (i.e Vardar) Macedonia was populated by Slavs, Albanians and Turks. The Slavs of Macedonia speak a language that's quite similar to Bulgarian but it depends on the dialect, some dialects are more similar to standardized Bulgarian.

Long story short Bulgaria went to war wih the rest including the Ottomans and was left with Pirin Macedonia, Greece got Aegean and Serbia got Vardar. Serbs would try to Serbianize the Vardar Macedonians and failed. 

The Macedonians formed the VMRO, a terrorist (or guerilla freedom fighter) group trying to secede from Yugoslavia (formed by Serbia) and even killed the king. The right wing (vrhovisti) wanted union with Bulgaria, the left wing (centralisti) were republican and wanted a multi-ethnic republic and were opposed to being subjects of the Bulgarian king. The Comintern supported the left wing and took up the Macedonian cause so when the communist-led Yugoslav People's Army won in 1945 Macedonia became a sovereign republic inside the Yugoslav federation.

When Yugoslavia fell apart the Macedonians went into full nation building mode trying to brand themselves the successors to ancient Macedon and Alexander the Great. (This is particularly Slavic Macedonians I'm talking about, the Albanians in Macedonia mostly became Albanian nationalists.) Though the government was very pro-Western, Greece saw Macedonia as a threat and saw its name as implying territorial ambitions to the entirety of Macedonia and blocked the EU and NATO accession of Macedonia. Macedonia's leadership became very corrupt and authoritarian as they strayed from the West.

Then after long and sometimes violent protests, the pro-Western party agreed to change the name, make peace with Greece and add Albanian as a second language. They won a majority in the parliamentary election and then bought over a part of the opposition which crossed the floor thus making a supermajority. They changed the constitution, had a referendum which had an extremely low turnout but they ran with it anyway and they're joining NATO in a month or so.",True,False,False,,,0,1572707147,,False,0,{},f661wzr,True,t3_dqdak5,False,False,t1_f65vpjo,/r/AskBalkans/comments/dqdak5/cultural_exchange_thread_welcome_redditors_from/f661wzr/,False,,1580632864,4,True,False,AskBalkans,t5_xmk1t,r/AskBalkans,public,0,

“It’s rare for a current or former leader of one of the world’s largest energy firms to testify under oath about climate change. That’s why a New York courtroom was packed on Wednesday to see ex-Exxon Mobil Corp. Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson take the witness stand and explain, in the context of a securities-fraud trial, that the company knew for years how global warming was a significant threat.

“We knew, we knew it was a real issue,” said Tillerson, 67. “We knew it was a serious issue and we knew it was one that’s going to be with us now, forevermore, and it’s not something that was just suddenly going to disappear off of our concern list because it is going to be with us for certainly well beyond my lifetime.”

Tillerson, who resigned in 2016 to become President Donald Trump’s first Secretary of State, was testifying in a trial over a lawsuit by the New York attorney general. The state alleges Exxon intentionally misled investors about the way the company accounted for the financial risk of climate change. Tillerson rejected the claim, but also took the opportunity to weigh in on the existential threat of global warming.

During 3 1/2 hours of testimony, he made few concessions under questioning by New York’s attorney. He used a lengthy cross-examination by Exxon’s lawyer to cast the company in a favorable light, in contrast to claims by environmentalists and some government officials that it helped trigger climate change and exacerbated the crisis by hiding it from the public.

Tillerson didn’t deny Exxon’s role in creating the problem -- which isn’t what the trial was about. But in his nuanced view, the company did its best to address the issue once it became apparent. He also said there may be plenty of blame to share, given that Exxon was providing products demanded by society.

Humanity, he said, has a hard time making changes to address the impacts of climate change because of the world’s never-ending demand for economic development and improved standards of living, which is tied directly to fossil fuels.

‘Keep Growing’

“If the economies are going to continue to not just perform, but grow, if people are going to continue to want to improve their quality of life, sustain their quality of life, they’re going to have to have energy, a lot of it, and the demand is going to keep growing,” Tillerson said.

“So there’s this natural tension” between that desire for growth and fixing climate change, “and that’s really the challenge that policymakers and legislators are confronted with,” he said.

One example of that challenge may be in Alberta, Canada, where Exxon has multibillion-dollar oil sands projects. Tillerson said it may not be unrealistic to assume that those projects will operate for decades without an increase in provincial taxes on greenhouse gas emissions.

That’s notable because New York claims Exxon was deceiving investors by predicting the province’s tax on greenhouse gas would remain steady, even as the company forecast rising levies on other projects through 2040.

“We have been through many changes in Alberta provincial government,” Tillerson said while being questioned by the state’s lawyer. “What I do know is the Alberta government doesn’t want to put the oil sands out of business. It’s important to them from a jobs, economic, tax revenue. And they always -- in Alberta -- the industry has always had a very kind of healthy dialogue with them, and they listened.”

Estimating Cost

The ex-CEO was also asked to explain why Exxon put in place proxy costs for carbon to estimate demand and greenhouse gas costs for expenses when it wasn’t required to do so. In short, his answer was that Exxon was worried about global warming early on and sought to protect the business long-term for the sake of investors. (Those costs are at the center of the New York lawsuit. The state claims they were a sham.)

“We took the issue quite seriously,“ Tillerson said. “We recognize the risk of climate change, and we recognize that it was becoming increasingly important to society, more broadly, and that policymakers and legislators were going to be responsive to their constituents and to the concerns of society, and they would begin to want to find ways to mitigate, if not reverse the effects of climate change.”

“We had been following the signs of climate change for many, many years,” he said.

But such costs weren’t the same everywhere Exxon operates, he said.

“It may be emissions are so de minimis that they’re inconsequential, or you may be in a business environment where the government is just not likely to do anything,” Tillerson said. “You know, if you’re in a third-world developing country.”

When he was CEO, Tillerson said the company had sought to promote the idea of a carbon tax to help ease society off fossil fuels.

“We had watched the European emission-trading system evolve and, in fact, we were a participant in it because of our operations there,” Tillerson said. “We had to be part of the trading system, and we saw a number of flaws with that system. In fact, if you look at what it has accomplished over its existence, it never has accomplished what it was intended to do. It hasn’t reduced any emissions.”

“We felt a carbon tax was the most simplistic. It is transparent,” he said. “You can’t game a carbon tax.”

Exxon’s early views of climate change, and what actions it took in response, may become more relevant in a series of so-called public nuisance lawsuits that accuse the industry’s biggest players, including Exxon, of selling products that led to global warming.”",True,False,False,,,0,1572709160,,False,0,{},f66arw3,False,t3_dqgstk,False,False,t3_dqgstk,/r/worldnews/comments/dqgstk/exxon_former_ceo_rex_tillerson_says_climate/f66arw3/,False,,1580637204,14,True,False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,r/worldnews,public,0,

Do you know what I did? I quit my job (that I liked to be honest) and when I made that choice I was already poor. I scraped up whatever money I had and sold things I didn’t need anymore, packed my stuff and went to the airport.  I live and Canada and had never been anywhere else in the world except Florida once. I booked a last minute flight to fucking Norway and ended up being there for 4 months. This experience is what made me want to continue because I wanted to feel this again, with a different country. It was so exciting to tell myself “maybe next time you could walk through all of Europe”. And guess what? I’m leaving in december for ?? months to Europe with nothing but a little bit of money and my backpack containing some cooking tools, a tent, a thin mattress and some other useful stuff and will walk from Italy to Denmark.

Serral was yawning his jaw off and looked like a zombie during the entire semifinal, and by the time the finals came around, Reynor wasn't looking much better.

Not trying to diminish Dark's accomplishment here, he played like a beast and Serral would have had a hard time beating him even on his best day, but the scheduling of this event, including the Ro16 in KR the week before, was a major fuckup on Blizzard's part.

A stunning renovated Tissot Electronic Day Date watch from 1973 with the box and original manual

A stunning vintage Tissot Electronic watch in a modern 38-39 mm size. This reference is extremely rare and therefore you can be sure that you will never meet another person wearing the same model. It is a perfect dress/everyday watch, which can be worn with almost anything - from a t-shirt to a suit; and still look great. I would recommend it for someone with a bigger wrist than mine however.

It's a highly collectable watch because it runs on the Tissot’s cal. 2020 ""the hummer"", which is Tissot’s eta based movement which was made using the patented tuning fork technology, leased from Bulova. (the most accurate and reliable in its time)

The main feature of the 2020 calibre is, that gentle sweep of the second hand; the watch doesn't tick - it just gently sweeps making the famed humming sound(it is very quiet in this model comparing to the original bulova models running on the caliber 214).

The dial is in a mint condition and simply hypnotizing; makes you want to check the time way too often than its necessary

There is some minor scratches on the case and some on the crystal, but nothing very visible. The crown is a bit worn but it is not extremely noticeable. (all can be seen on the pictures).

**The case of the watch together with its crown was completely renovated by a talented professional (as you can see by the final result).**

The watch was revised by a watchmaker in September and keeps the time up to around 10-30 seconds per day in case of these watches it varies widely based on the temperature etc.

The watch comes with a great looking Italian leather strap.

Case size excl. crown: 39 ø x 42mm high and around 11mm thick

My wrist is around 17cm for the reference

      I told myself I wasn’t going to reply anymore as I’d be better off spending my time talking to a wall. You’re clearly deadset on sticking to your viewpoint. But I’ll give it one last go and then 
I’m done reading and responding. 

&gt;How is being afraid of losing a business partner not a viable reason to shit on America for not standing up to one of biggest shithead nations in the world?!

You continue to show your lack of understanding. I’m not talking about the US “losing a business partner”. I’m talking about the effects on the world economy. Giving how large a player China now is, convincing Europe and the rest of the US’s allies to heavily sanction China will result in major negative effects on the entire system. For evidence of that, you only need to look at what the relatively minor trade war the US and China are currently participating in is doing, then multiple that exponentially. 

&gt;Imposing sanctions on China will not cause WWIII

There is absolutely no way you or anyone else could claim that with any amount of certainty. All that hostility you mention is very likely to be pointed toward what the Chinese government will easily frame as the aggressions of the west. Hostilities will rise and rise until there’s a breaking point. Boom, ww3. They have almost complete control of the narrative within their borders. They’re already framing the Hong Kong protests as the West paying people and spreading propaganda, and that’s happening in country meaning it’s a bit easier for citizens to get more of a real story, and has very minimal effects on the mainland population so it’s not got the full might of their propaganda machine baring down. And if you truly think China is too cowardly to stand up to a strong nation militarily and would fold easily when challenged, simply look at the South China Sea situation that’s ongoing. This situation also isn’t helped by the US not having a particularly competent (putting it nicely) administration in charge of navigating the world at the moment either. 

&gt;When history looks back at this it will be clear that America was condoning what China is doing by continuing its business relations with that shit hole. 

Maybe. But more likely history will acknowledge the extremely tough spot the US is in and how like most things things are a lot more nuanced than people sitting behind a keyboard with zero accountability make it seem. 


While I appreciate that your perspective is coming from caring about the atrocities happening to innocent people and wanting it to stop, and I wish it was as easy as you make it seem. But you clearly don’t really have an actual grasp of all the nuances involved or the possibly catastrophic outcomes. The situation isn’t as simple as you’d like to believe and there’s no easy answers and a lot of things that could go wrong and make things worse overall.

I’ve spent more time than I should have discussion this, and if nothing I’ve said so far has made an impact there’s nothing I can say that will. So I’m out. While we firmly disagree with each other, I appreciate it remaining overall civil.

Israel's occupation of Palestine and its racist immigration policy of only allowing Jews of the world in while blocking any Palestinian from returning to their homeland is what I'm calling apartheid/colonialist. The settlements are all Jewish Zionist colonies. Why else are Arab Israelis not allowed to take part in them and it's reserved exclusively to those is Jewish descent? The settlements gradually have displaced hundreds of thousands of Palestinians while replacing their homes with Jewish colonists coming from all over the world. How is this not colonization? The colonial policies continue exist to today.

I don't know why you have this victim complex of connecting all criticisms of Israeli racist policies to the discriminating against Jews. What you're doing is the equivalent of saying for example that the illegitimate American invasion and occupation of Iraq is racist towards Americans. No. Stop trying to hide anti-humane policies behind the Jewish people who do not deserve such racism, even if it's from fellow Jews.

Your argument that since most Israeli citizens are born there makes them not colonists anymore is a valid one. This is why I don't support expulsion of the Jewish immigrants or their offspring and am vehemently opposed to it. What we need to establish here is that Zionism as an ideology and with respect to the Israel project in particular is based on ethnic cleansing, colonialism and apartheid.

Então, acho que olhar outros indicadores é uma boa ideia, que aí a gente pode descobrir se esse retorno grande tá vindo pelo fato da empresa estar barata de forma geral ou se as variáveis de fluxo de caixa são melhores para prever retornos futuros.

Outra coisa interessante que você pode fazer é uma regressão contra o CAPM, e ver qual o tamanho e a significância estatística do alfa.

EDIT: Achei um estudo relativamente recente que indica que P/VPA não tem poder explicativo sobre os retornos das ações no Brasil, mas não li com calma.

He has 2 bachelor degrees and one masters from reputable unis in Europe. My matching history ranging from remote workers to high-earning employees. I was looking for men over 30, obviously.

1. If you know what you’re looking for, it’s worth it. Keep in mind, dating apps aren’t exclusively for hook-ups or finding potential spouses.

If you travel a lot, it’s useful to get recommendations from the locals. I did this while on a roadtrip in Europe. Got plenty of matches, I asked them where to eat or what to do, once I got the recs, I unmatched them to prevent future complications. Sounds dick-ish, but I wasn’t looking for a relationship back then, and certainly not looking for a one-night stand with potentially STD-carrying strangers.


2. I only used Tinder because one dating app was already overwhelming enough. Though since I narrowed down my potential matches to men from a specific age range, I saw some profiles of people I knew in real life. Let me tell you, their profiles didn’t come close to anywhere near their real personalities. That being said, I’m a fairly private person, so I too chose carefully what information I wanted to put in my bio.

My advice, take everything you see with a grain of salt, and when you meet in real life, trust your instincts. Watch out for red flags.


3. Contrary to what Tinder tries to tell you, you don’t necessarily need a paid account. While it was tempting to see who the 1,352 men who liked my profile were, I was fine with sorting out the ones I actually matched with. 

Some of them were creepy, some were straight up catfishing, some were liars, and some were just desperate. This is where the unmatch or block button comes in handy. Don’t be afraid to use it.


4. Do you have some funny/weird stories to share?
Yep. In Korea, instead of staying in a hotel, I rented an AirBnB flat with a washing machine (among other things). Now the washing machine only had Korean letters on it, I couldn’t even find the power button, and google translate wasn’t much of a help, so I turned to Tinder to help me operate the damn thing.

That’s a pretty poor explanation and there’s quite a big difference between ‘is not a monolith’ and ‘has massive WMD warships and seems to be at war with humanity again’. The game needed to explain this to an extent and the story seems off without it. By the end of halo 3 which takes place half a year after the events on the ark we see humanity at peace with absolutely no hint that any dissenting sangheili can mobilize a fleet. 

That’s pretty jarring and pretty poor writing to leave unexplained.

&gt; 2.	⁠Jul is introduced in Spartan Ops

Spartan ops is not 4’a campaign narrative.

Relying on external material to that extent is 4’s core issue.

&gt; would have distracted from introducing the Didact.


Game doesn’t explore this to any extent either though. The didact is a pretty bland antagonist without the Greg bear novels and arguably the weakest of the franchise.

&gt; As I stated previously, this shows that they are following a different edict that the original Covenant.


Not really.

All the player ever sees is them worshipping the didact and praising the discovery of the shield world. The player is neither shown nor told that the religion is any different.

The only way you do is through the kill five trilogy and we both well know it.

&gt; His introduction is clunky, but the information is all there 

Through a rushed exposition dump which besides that the didact is shown to be a pretty generic “destroy all humans” alien.

&gt; The Covenant wasn't fleshed out until Halo 2, if you'll recall, and even then we never get any proper motivation for their want to destroy Humanity until a book in 2007.

CE didn’t explain the covies well no but it gets a pass as it’s narrative largely focuses on the ring itself and actually demonstrates that arc well.

CE also doesn’t need to explain the covies as there’s no existing arcs in the story that would contradict humanity fighting an alien conglomerate as its a brand new story. That does exist in halo 4.

IRONICALLY enough though CE does give us more info about the covies and the war in its first scene than 4 does in its entirety, we know through cortana and Keyes that they’re a significantly advanced alien race that has us on the back foot in an assumedly long and costly war. That’s really all the subtext CE needs before handing it off to 2 to really explore the covies.

Also 2 does heavily imply religious motivations from the get home and gives us an overarching motive for why the covenant are so hell bent on finding these halo rings. We also get a lot of newfound motivation for their hatred for us as we just destroyed the single most significant religious artifact in the previous title

&gt; Not inherently. If they do for you, that's your problem.


Yes inherently. This is again a pretty lazy way to explain away all of the plot issues it presents.

If you can explain how a long dead civilization suddenly changed its architecture style, how and why a never before seen set of phenotypes of covenant races suddenly dominate this new covenant and why the nano bots in chiefs armor are never used before or again then be my guest.

&gt; It absolutely does. It has issues, but all the Halo games do when you break them down. Halo 4 is praised by the lore community at large for it's treatment of John and Cortana's relationship, making John into a real character, it's integration of EU materials (to varying degrees), and while possibly not as widely regarded, for me and some others, it's respect towards everything that came before.

How about **negative interest rates** raping your yuropeen bank account all the way from ...

https://archive.md/YRzpP CNN / July 29, 2019 / How negative interest rates helped turn Deutsche Bank into a disaster

&gt;**In 2014,** the European Central Bank wanted to boost the sluggish economy but interest rates were already at zero. The **unconventional decision to take them into negative territory was aimed at encouraging growth and avoiding deflation,** but it meant banks were charged a fee for parking their reserves with the central bank. 

&gt;Although all banks in the eurozone have been subject to the ECB's extreme policies, Deutsche Bank's business model, and precarious balance sheet, made it particularly susceptible to this pressure.

&gt;Negative rates didn't cause Deutsche Bank's troubles, Vistesen said, but they ""absolutely"" magnified them.

That's right son, you can keep your money under your bed and it's BETTER than leaving it with Deutsche Bank.

The enemy imposed metric measurements, drink-driving laws, immigrants and smoking bans and now it wants to stop Brexit. They take us for fools. They think we are stupid.*

*And yet their actions show that cynics who doubt everything trust Nigel Farage, even though he takes them for absolute idiots. It was an education to watch him make his offer of a Leave alliance to Boris Johnson on Friday. Farage’s warm-up acts played all the old tunes. Richard Tice, a property investor who has the well-cut suits and fading good looks of the type of charmer who cons widows out of their savings, said the Tories lived in the “stinking rotten borough of Westminster”. Claire Fox, who, satisfyingly, looks as malicious in the flesh as you would expect a member of the Revolutionary Communist party who ended up on the hard right via a spell denying the massacre of Bosnia’s Muslims to look, followed up. The Tories were among the elitists, scoffing behind their manicured hands and calling Brexiters “xenophobes, ignorant and far right”. Ann Widdecombe came next. I won’t pretend to understand all, or most, of what she said. But her drift was that the Tories were a pack of liars who would betray Brexit and all who believed in it.*

*Farage then strode to the stage like a televangelist to the pulpit. He posed as the last honest politician in England. Unless Johnson agreed to ditch his deal with the EU, he would run Brexit party candidates against the Conservatives in every seat. Liberals were ecstatic. As Johnson cannot agree to destroy his own settlement, Remainers were relieved. The pro-Remain campaign group Best for Britain estimates that an unspoken agreement between the Brexit and Conservative parties could deliver Johnson a comfortable majority. Now Agent Farage, the Remainer mole, was sabotaging the Tories’ chances and with them the chances of Brexit.*

*Yet for a supposedly iron man, Farage sounded remarkably flexible. He praised Johnson’s energy and sympathised with his difficulties. He emphasised that he had until mid-November to decide where to run candidates and would almost certainly not run them against the Tory right. “This is a ferret searching for a hole to reverse down,” I thought.*

*The election campaign has achieved what many thought impossible and lowered the standards of public debate. Johnson does not have a “deal” with the EU, merely a withdrawal agreement. Every circle of hell remains available for Britain if his Brexit passes, including a few the devil himself has yet to discover.*

*Farage could spin a quiet rapprochement with Johnson a dozen different ways. We remain in the single market and customs union until December 2020. Johnson hopes to negotiate a trade agreement by then. But trade deals take years to complete. Farage and the Tory right could tell their followers we could crash out in December or in June, when we would have to ask for an extension to the transition period to keep the negotiations going.*

*Farage could say he would stand down candidates to stop Corbyn. He could say that he had discovered a “Canada-style trade deal” is possible and rely on the fact that the majority of people do not know what a Canada deal is or why the EU would demand harsher terms from Britain than it demands of a country thousands of miles away.*

*Compromise would betray Brexit purists. But Farage and Johnson are already betraying them. Both say they expect to win in south Wales, the north of England and Midlands, the very areas whose manufacturing industries would be hardest hit by pulling us out of the single market.*

*Then there is the revealing game Farage has played with Brexit party members, which shows how little he thinks of them. He persuaded at least 3,000 to apply to become parliamentary candidates and charged them £100 apiece for the privilege. Yet when the candidates were announced, there were many of the same faces from Farage’s Ukip days or Fox’s Revolutionary Communist turned Reactionary Chauvinist party. Otto English of the Byline Times, who covered the story, received private emails from working-class hopefuls who said they were told to campaign in byelections to “increase your chances of being selected”. When they got there, no one took their names. Straight afterwards, they received a “you have not been selected” mass email.*

*Individuals have walked away from Farage. But his core stayed loyal, as the core of populist movements always does. For if there is any meaning in the vapid word, “populism” can be defined as the willingness of voters to be lied to. The louder they scream “all politicians are liars”, the harder they fall for the big lie from their chosen demagogue. Political scientists define devoted supporters of Farage, Trump and Corbyn as “low-trust” voters, who believe nothing they hear on the news. And yet they turn as trusting as children when their great leaders lead them on. In the case of Brexit, they are easy to lead and to fool. The divide in Brexit Britain is not based on class but on age and education: 70% of voters whose educational attainment was only GCSE or lower and 64% of over-65s voted to leave.*

*I am not saying that having a degree ensures you are wise or even clever or that every pensioner is suffering from mental decline. But there are good reasons why pyramid sellers and faith healers prey on the uneducated and conmen target widows. If you want people to fleece, these are your best prospects.*

*“Some ideas are so stupid that only intellectuals can believe them,” runs the old line. But the converse also applies. Some ideas are so stupid that only the uneducated can believe them – and Farage is proving that Brexit is top of the list.*",True,False,False,,,1,1572720631,,False,0,{},f67ld2r,True,t3_dqohn8,False,True,t3_dqohn8,/r/ukpolitics/comments/dqohn8/the_more_nigel_farage_plays_brexiters_for_fools/f67ld2r/,False,,1580660135,0,True,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,r/ukpolitics,public,0,

I can be assured of hearing that question several times at any event I attend. It's an interesting question, given the aircraft's proclivity for speed, but there really isn't one number to give, as the jet would always give you a little more speed if you wanted it to. It was common to see 35 miles a minute. Because we flew a programmed Mach number on most missions, and never wanted to harm the plane in any way, we never let it run out to any limits of temperature or speed. Thus, each SR-71 pilot had his own individual “high” speed that he saw at some point on some mission. I saw mine over Libya when Khadafy fired two missiles my way, and max power was in order. Let’s just say that the plane truly loved speed and effortlessly took us to Mach numbers we hadn’t previously seen. So it was with great surprise, when at the end of one of my presentations, someone asked, “what was the slowest you ever flew the Blackbird?” This was a first. After giving it some thought, I was reminded of a story that I had never shared before, and relayed the following. I was flying the SR-71 out of RAF Mildenhall, England , with my back-seater, Walt Watson; we were returning from a mission over Europe and the Iron Curtain when we received a radio transmission from home base. As we scooted across Denmark in three minutes, we learned that a small RAF base in the English countryside had requested an SR-71 fly-past. The air cadet commander there was a former Blackbird pilot, and thought it would be a motivating moment for the young lads to see the mighty SR-71 perform a low approach. No problem, we were happy to do it. After a quick aerial refueling over the North Sea , we proceeded to find the small airfield. Walter had a myriad of sophisticated navigation equipment in the back seat, and began to vector me toward the field. Descending to subsonic speeds, we found ourselves over a densely wooded area in a slight haze. Like most former WWII British airfields, the one we were looking for had a small tower and little surrounding infrastructure. Walter told me we were close and that I should be able to see the field, but I saw nothing. Nothing but trees as far as I could see in the haze. We got a little lower, and I pulled the throttles back from 325 knots we were at. With the gear up, anything under 275 was just uncomfortable. Walt said we were practically over the field—yet; there was nothing in my windscreen. I banked the jet and started a gentle circling maneuver in hopes of picking up anything that looked like a field. Meanwhile, below, the cadet commander had taken the cadets up on the catwalk of the tower in order to get a prime view of the fly-past. It was a quiet, still day with no wind and partial gray overcast. Walter continued to give me indications that the field should be below us but in the overcast and haze, I couldn't see it.. The longer we continued to peer out the window and circle, the slower we got. With our power back, the awaiting cadets heard nothing. I must have had good instructors in my flying career, as something told me I better cross-check the gauges. As I noticed the airspeed indicator slide below 160 knots, my heart stopped and my adrenalin-filled left hand pushed two throttles full forward. At this point we weren't really flying, but were falling in a slight bank. Just at the moment that both afterburners lit with a thunderous roar of flame (and what a joyous feeling that was) the aircraft fell into full view of the shocked observers on the tower. Shattering the still quiet of that morning, they now had 107 feet of fire-breathing titanium in their face as the plane leveled and accelerated, in full burner, on the tower side of the infield, closer than expected, maintaining what could only be described as some sort of ultimate knife-edge pass. Quickly reaching the field boundary, we proceeded back to Mildenhall without incident. We didn't say a word for those next 14 minutes. After landing, our commander greeted us, and we were both certain he was reaching for our wings. Instead, he heartily shook our hands and said the commander had told him it was the greatest SR-71 fly-past he had ever seen, especially how we had surprised them with such a precise maneuver that could only be described as breathtaking.

I can be assured of hearing that question several times at any event I attend. It's an interesting question, given the aircraft's proclivity for speed, but there really isn't one number to give, as the jet would always give you a little more speed if you wanted it to. It was common to see 35 miles a minute. Because we flew a programmed Mach number on most missions, and never wanted to harm the plane in any way, we never let it run out to any limits of temperature or speed. Thus, each SR-71 pilot had his own individual “high” speed that he saw at some point on some mission. I saw mine over Libya when Khadafy fired two missiles my way, and max power was in order. Let’s just say that the plane truly loved speed and effortlessly took us to Mach numbers we hadn’t previously seen. So it was with great surprise, when at the end of one of my presentations, someone asked, “what was the slowest you ever flew the Blackbird?” This was a first. After giving it some thought, I was reminded of a story that I had never shared before, and relayed the following. I was flying the SR-71 out of RAF Mildenhall, England , with my back-seater, Walt Watson; we were returning from a mission over Europe and the Iron Curtain when we received a radio transmission from home base. As we scooted across Denmark in three minutes, we learned that a small RAF base in the English countryside had requested an SR-71 fly-past. The air cadet commander there was a former Blackbird pilot, and thought it would be a motivating moment for the young lads to see the mighty SR-71 perform a low approach. No problem, we were happy to do it. After a quick aerial refueling over the North Sea , we proceeded to find the small airfield. Walter had a myriad of sophisticated navigation equipment in the back seat, and began to vector me toward the field. Descending to subsonic speeds, we found ourselves over a densely wooded area in a slight haze. Like most former WWII British airfields, the one we were looking for had a small tower and little surrounding infrastructure. Walter told me we were close and that I should be able to see the field, but I saw nothing. Nothing but trees as far as I could see in the haze. We got a little lower, and I pulled the throttles back from 325 knots we were at. With the gear up, anything under 275 was just uncomfortable. Walt said we were practically over the field—yet; there was nothing in my windscreen. I banked the jet and started a gentle circling maneuver in hopes of picking up anything that looked like a field. Meanwhile, below, the cadet commander had taken the cadets up on the catwalk of the tower in order to get a prime view of the fly-past. It was a quiet, still day with no wind and partial gray overcast. Walter continued to give me indications that the field should be below us but in the overcast and haze, I couldn't see it.. The longer we continued to peer out the window and circle, the slower we got. With our power back, the awaiting cadets heard nothing. I must have had good instructors in my flying career, as something told me I better cross-check the gauges. As I noticed the airspeed indicator slide below 160 knots, my heart stopped and my adrenalin-filled left hand pushed two throttles full forward. At this point we weren't really flying, but were falling in a slight bank. Just at the moment that both afterburners lit with a thunderous roar of flame (and what a joyous feeling that was) the aircraft fell into full view of the shocked observers on the tower. Shattering the still quiet of that morning, they now had 107 feet of fire-breathing titanium in their face as the plane leveled and accelerated, in full burner, on the tower side of the infield, closer than expected, maintaining what could only be described as some sort of ultimate knife-edge pass. Quickly reaching the field boundary, we proceeded back to Mildenhall without incident. We didn't say a word for those next 14 minutes. After landing, our commander greeted us, and we were both certain he was reaching for our wings. Instead, he heartily shook our hands and said the commander had told him it was the greatest SR-71 fly-past he had ever seen, especially how we had surprised them with such a precise maneuver that could only be described as breathtaking.

\- Nunca usei e tenho interesse em usar algo coisa com o arco-íris. Não porque não concordo com a causa, já fui em algumas paradas aqui em Curitiba, mas acho os produtos com a bandeira feios e coloridos demais. Prefiro uma camiseta preta ou azul me representa mais.

\- Afeminado e discreto são termos que eu não uso mais. Ambos são cheios de estigma. Eu sou o Filipe e tá ótimo.

\- Assumir abertamente pra sociedade. Acredito que nem conseguiria fazer isso. Não tenho redes sociais. Não sou próximo da minha família. Meus pais sabem, meu irmão tbm é LGBT. A situação familiar ficou mais tranquila agora. Então se eu começasse a namorar nem contaria nada pra ninguém, porque basicamente não tenho ninguém pra contar sobre tbm. E tá tudo bem. Assumir acho tão zzzzz. Quando tava namorando apresentei ele pros meus pais, mas sem cerimônia. Nada demais. Eu acho exagero esse ""ASSUMIR"", na real me dá um cringe. Mas sem julgamentos, tem gente que acha lindo. E tá bacana.

\- Qualquer exposição grande no momento vem se tornando perigosa. De volta, por nem ter whatsapp, não sinto tanto esse medo de críticas e ataques. Converso com os meus pais sobre algumas coisas em casa. E na faculdade, e vida lá fora eu faço a tia do suco. E converso sobre o banal, não aguento mais qualquer tipo de militância. Me cansou um pouco. Na rua, sentia olhares estranhos quando andava de mãos dadas com meu namorado. Mas agora que estou sozinho, tá tudo bem.

\- Parente pra mim nem é gente. Cago total pros meus familiares. Eliminei eles da minha vida totalmente.

\- Eu fiz uma limpa de relações nos últimos tempos. Conhecia muito hétero e gay que me irritava. E sei lá, por um tempo me importava com o número de amigos eu tinha, seguidores e o que falavam de mim. Tudo isso parece tão bobo agora. Falou merda pra mim, tá fora. Tchau. Independente de sexualidade. Eu não sou obrigado a nada.

Todas as ações onde você inicia um contato com ela sugeridas aqui são com o intuito de te fazer se sentir melhor. Mesmo que você queria ajudar ela, ao entrar em contato nesse momento dessa maneira, você está apenas se ajudando, pois:

* Coloca a menina numa posição desconfortável onde ela precisa se expor novamente aos eventos que rolaram, sem falar de pressionar ela a te perdoar num momento que ela pode nem estar afim de tomar essa decisão.

* Não ajuda ela com o que ela enfrenta, pois é uma comunicação que inerentemente explica somente suas ações. Não é um diálogo construtivo, pois o intuito dele é de te fazer se sentir melhor.

* Cria um ambiente ruim no círculo de amizades, onde põe o ônus de você participar dele nela.

As ações mais corretas você já fez, que foi pedir desculpas e se afastar do grupo. Agora é deixar a menina processar tudo e decidir como levar adiante essa questão.

I never heard of that (to be fair, I didn't look now either) but it would be surprising since NS is, again factually accurately, more expensive than NMBS for comparable distances.

The moaning, well... That is typically Belgian, we'll moan about pretty much anything. I understand how one could be happier about NS than NMBS (however marginal the difference is), but seriously, stop trying to imply UK rail's superiority to NMBS, it is quite generally considered the worst in all of Europe. Those are not statements based on personal observations or gut feelings, but verifiable data: look up punctuality data, look up safety records, look up financial data,... 

About your cancellation anecdote: every single time my regular train from my home to my job (or visa-versa) gets cancelled, the next one is only 18 (home -&gt; work) or 16 (work -&gt; home) minutes away. And that's NMBS. On the other hand, I got my train cancelled in the Netherlands once and I lost one full hour waiting for the next one which was slightly delayed so I lost my 2 minute connection a few stations after that... So I had to wait another hour at that station too for a grand total of 2 hours delay. Another time travelling with NS, I didn't even get home the same day. But those are anecdotes, and just as much as yours, my anecdotes don't prove anything for either side of the story as they are highly circumstantial depending on your route, time of travel, reasons for cancellation,... that whole day delay? A fracture in the track due to the high temperatures. Not even your mythical NS can drive trains then ;)

As said before by others, you can't blame NMBS for the shitty route you want/need to take, blame the government for not realising Limburg is a thing and needs transportation too.

The Arts and Crafts movement was an international trend in the decorative and fine arts that began in Britain and flourished in Europe and North America between about 1880 and 1920, emerging in Japan in the 1920s as the Mingei movement. It stood for traditional craftsmanship using simple forms, and often used medieval, romantic, or folk styles of decoration. It advocated economic and social reform and was essentially anti-industrial. It had a strong influence on the arts in Europe until it was displaced by Modernism in the 1930s, and its influence continued among craft makers, designers, and town planners long afterwards.The term was first used by T. J. Cobden-Sanderson at a meeting of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society in 1887, although the principles and style on which it was based had been developing in England for at least 20 years.

The team sent a questionnaire to 600 unselected migraine patients to anonymously survey their experience with migraine pain intensity during sexual activity. Approximately 60% of the respondents who engaged in sexual activity during a migraine reported relief.

A professor of neurology and clinical neurophysiology and chair of the Headache Panel of the European Academy of Neurology, Dr. Evers discussed the study’s implications with Practical Pain Management. He believes that orgasm is a key factor in pain relief, due to the endorphins released during climax. It was unclear in his study whether sexual excitement leading up to orgasm had any positive effects on pain, but he did note that the movement of sex could worsen certain migraine symptoms such as sensitivity to touch and nausea. And while the neurologist does not routinely discuss his patients’ sex lives with them, if asked, he advises masturbation. Due to the nature of the survey-based study, biological imperatives for pain relief are unknown; Dr. Evers and his colleagues are careful to only speculate that the endorphins released during orgasm are the primary reason for the pain relief.""

One of the major reasons is the idea that, ""even if it's not real, the global warming agenda is cleaning up the environment""

**Second**

In reality, much of the global warming agenda is actually **harming** the environment, not helping.  

Millions of tonnes of mine waste are produced and often flushed into the environment 
in order to get the [toxic rare earth minerals needed for the production of solar panels, wind turbines, fluorescent lamps, electric and hybrid cars, etc.](https://earthjournalism.net/stories/the-dark-side-of-renewable-energy)

Rare earth mining entails [shocking environmental costs.](https://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/8015-Death-of-the-desert)

Research has found that producing one tonne of rare earth ore (in terms of rare earth oxides) produces [200 cubic metres of acidic waste water.](https://earthjournalism.net/stories/the-dark-side-of-renewable-energy)

And contrary to popular belief the oil/natural gas industry loves renewables because every new installation of solar or wind needs to be pair up with a newly installed natural gas generator.

This is because you have to have a quickly starting backup for when solar/wind isn't producing.

 ""Tanto o padre quanto o pastor disseram a mesma coisa, que sempre há o momento de Deus e que não podemos contestar a vontade dele. Poxa, mas eu também tinha as minhas vontades e planos para o Danilo ao meu lado. Existe um confronto com Deus nesse sentido"", conta sobre seus sentimentos.

 Aos 49, Cafu conta que chora diariamente, mas o faz escondido da família, às vezes no trânsito ou no telefone com amigos, porque sente que precisa manter-se como ""pilar"" da casa. Ele diz que vai a cada cinco dias visitar o túmulo do filho no cemitério e que não tem como descrever a dor da perda.

 ""Não tive coragem de entrar no quarto dele até agora, meu filho Wellington recolheu as coisas e colocou tudo para doação. Nunca mais pisei no campo onde aconteceu a convulsão,"" revela.

  Ele confirmou que o infarto aconteceu após seu filho jogar uma partida de futebol em sua casa e disse que ele mesmo, diante da urgência dos fatos, o levou para o hospital.

 Também relatou que os problemas de saúde já vinham sendo tratados desde que Danilo tinha 24 anos, quando sofreu seu primeiro ataque cardíaco. Ele faleceu com 30, dois dias antes de uma consulta agendada para fazer um cateterismo e reavaliar sua condição cardiovascular.

 Cafu também [agradeceu o apoio dos jogadores que atuaram com ele](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/09/cafu-recebe-apoio-de-ex-atletas-e-pede-oracoes-apos-morte-do-filho.shtml) na seleção brasileira entre as Copas de 1994 e 2006. Segundo ele, todos ligaram ou mandaram mensagem, uma vez que conheciam Danilo porque o lateral sempre levou o filho nos jogos pelo Brasil.

 O capitão do penta disse ainda que foca nos trabalhos para manter a mente ocupada, e explicou o [momento financeiro complicado](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2019/07/capitao-da-selecao-no-penta-cafu-enfrenta-dividas-milionarias.shtml) que vive sua fundação.

The UN based its report on a publication by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Source of the gas and those responsible for its use are being investigated.

The following week, [UK scientists claim to have evidence](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/04/13/middleeast/syria-chemical-attack-uk/) that sarin gas, or a similar substance, was used based on samples from victims. Investigations continue to confirm the gas used and those responsible.

So U.S Military intelligence, Secretary of State, Defense Secretary, the UN, OCPW, France, and the UK all found lots of evidence proving Sarin gas was used. ""highly suspect"" my ass, stop letting Russia gaslight the living shit out of your brain cells.

They eat snails and slugs very effectively. If two or three comes into my garden and stay I have no need to keep poring money into Blitzem as the slug and snail population literally plummets. Once they leave I become aware of it as within a fortnight the slug and snail population rockets upwards. We simply do not have a slug and snail predator alternative in this country outside a hedgehog. Do remember the slug and snail we frequently encounter in this country ( like 99% of the time ) are European slugs and snails! Their natural predator ... hedgehogs. We have effective caught ourselves in the cycle that no hedgehogs, more pesticides. 

To me hedgehogs have a role in urban and suburban garden ecosystem in NZ ( as remember our garden systems are modelled after American, European and East Asian based garden systems, and those garden systems usually relies on them having natural predators against specific pest staying in them. The small ecology within the suburbs and within the immediate adjacent countryside of the major towns and cities in this country are in fact surprisingly European, East Asian or northern South East Asian. Just look at our bird species in the cities, or insect species. A person I know who visited NZ from Plymouth was surprised to see the number of European bumblebees, thrush, starling and sparrows in my garden, as well as the plants we have.

I however believe they should not be allowed near or in nature reserves or national parks where the NZ native ecological system predominates. They should be humanely removed ( along with possums, stoats, weasels, dogs, cats, rainbow lorikeets, thrush, starling etc.. ) from those areas. I believe that it is in fact fair to maintain a 500m buffer zone around national parks to allow the natural NZ ecosystem to thrive ( accepting that areas around cities are more European and Asian ecosystems now, and the human population probably as a whole prefer it that way owing the the socio-cultural heritage most of us originate from ).

Personally I do not think dogs have a role in nature reserves or national parks nor do cats .. but people seem to like excluding dog and cats from the list of dangerous animals in nature reserves. I do not see how dogs or cats are less destructive than hedgehogs in the natural NZ environment ( nor urban or suburban ) 

I also do not think European honey bees ( the predominant bees used in honey production in this country ) should be allowed in nature reserves either as they are not suitable pollinators for some of our native plants like the kaka beak, and they outcompete local native bees who already struggle badly in the semi-urban, European and Asian based garden we have.",True,False,False,,,0,1572737745,,1572738693,0,{},f69826k,False,t3_dqqop6,False,False,t3_dqqop6,/r/newzealand/comments/dqqop6/the_hedgehog_debate/f69826k/,False,,1580688927,7,True,False,newzealand,t5_2qhma,r/newzealand,public,0,

Provavelmente muita gente tem tara por cunhada ou por irmãs, e as vezes talvez coloque essa tara em prática, o que esse pessoal pelo visto não leva muito a sério é a possibilidade de um dia gerar uma situação igual essa sua, onde tio é pai mas tem outra família oficial...

Quando era ""jovem"" achei que vivia numa sociedade perfeita onde toda família era composta por pai, mãe e filhos, mas conforme e adolescência passa e você vai tendo acesso às histórias dos casais, fica mais claro que não é bem assim. Tipo a mãe de um amigo era prostituta num puteiro, o pai ia muito lá, chamou ela pra sair de lá, ela saiu, tiveram filhos, mas os filhos só souberam disso depois de adultos. Ou se eu pegar geograficamente as famílias, a outra única família no meu quarteirão (O resto eram 8-11 oficinas ao redor de casa) era ""normal"", mas no quarteirão do lado já começava, na esquina eram 2 meninos um pouco mais novos que eu, meio diferentes entre si mas nunca dei bola, depois de velho soubemos que eram irmãos só por parte de pai, um era filho da ""outra"" mas o pai criou desde criança junto com o outro e pra todos eram irmãos, ambos filhos da esposa. Na casa do lado morou um assaltante de banco (Esse não tinha rolo com filhos, mas pros demais vizinhos parecia um pai muito legal por ter carro conversível e comprar brinquedo caro, o que só depois notamos é que ele estava aqui no fim do mundo é se escondendo, e quando a família se mudou às pressas não foi por trabalho do pai e sim porque ele foi preso, com uma duzia de mandados de prisão, a família com vergonha sumiu e nunca mais nem mandou carta pros amigos, só soubemos disso nos tempos do Orkut onde pessoal foi reencontrando quem foi embora), voltando à vizinhança, na casa adiante era um senhor de uns 55 anos que a cada ano trocava de ""esposa"", eram sempre jovens de 17-20 anos, uma ficou mais tempo, mas trouxe um irmão quase da nossa idade, estranhamos que quando a mãe veio visitar ela tinha cada de uns 60 anos, nem sei como alguém teria filho aos 50, mas depois de anos fui saber que o menino na verdade era filho, não irmão da moça, o pai abusou da menina aos 13 anos, ela engravidou, então pra dar menos rolo criaram como irmão da mãe.

Até nuns familiares, viemos pra essa região de MT porque um parente distante veio, 2 irmãos, primos de algum avô ou avó, um dos irmãos não tinha filhos mas criava o filho de um ex-funcionário, até aí nada de mais, mas depois de velho soube que um dos sobrinho na verdade era filho (A mulher teve 3 filhos com o marido, e um com o cunhado), inclusive quando morreu a divisão da herança foi tipo metade pra esse ""sobrinho"", e a outra metade dividido entre os outros sobrinhos). Deixa ver... o pai do meu cunhado casou com a própria prima (Mas fora isso foram casados 60 anos, sem mais rolos na família), minha ex-mulher tem 4 ou 5 irmãos por parte de pai que nem conhece, e os irmãos por parte de mãe são de 3 pais diferentes, uma sobrinha dela quer saber quantos irmãos ela tem por parte de pai mas o resto da família nem consegue saber porque o pai caminhoneiro largava um filho por ano no país, e quando ela nasceu dizia que tinha 6 filhos, mas em 15 anos deve ter tido mais uns 6. Alias, a minha sobrinha mesmo, é adotada, se um dia ela quiser saber dos irmãos biológicos vai ser compliciado, porque a mãe drogada teve meia duzia de filhos distribuídos por parentes, o pai teve ainda mais (2 só na clínica onde fez tratamento contra dependência química), mas isso foi a 10 anos, como foram embora pra outra região devem ter por lá mais alguns filhos espalhados cada um, é o tipo de gente que se muda e não mantém contato, mora em periferia sem internet nem nada então a expressão ""sumiu no mundo"" é a mais descritiva.

E eu nem posso dizer que sou uma boa influência, porque um amigo de infância casou com uma moça que já tinha filha (Até aí nada de mais), mas depois de um tempo ele teve filho com outra, e quando perguntei porque ela ""perdoou"", soube que a filha que teve antes de casar foi com um cara casado. O outro melhor amigo de infância passou por quase isso, mas foi pior, engravidou uma mulher casada, quando ficou sabendo (Uns 3 anos depois) o marido matou a própria mulher e morreu no tiroteio com a polícia, aí sobrou pra ele criar o filho, e como a esposa atual não era casada com ele na época, ela topou.

Alias, quando fazia faculdade de teologia, nas férias ao invés de voltar pra MT (2,5 dias de busão) eu ia visitar meus parentes no interior (Comida e transporte de graça por 1 mês), um tio-avô (Aquele pessoal que nasceu praticamente no século retrasado) sempre que ia falando a histórias dos familiares falava em ""filho legítimo do fulano"", ele nunca falava a palavra ""filho"" sem complementar, até o dia que ele falou ""filho ilegítimo"", aí eu tive que perguntar se ele tinha certeza de todos os ""legítimos"" que ele falou antes, e como ele estava na casa dos 80 anos, e eu nem era dali e portanto não faria fofoca na vizinhança, ele começou a contar sobre os filhos ilegítimos na vizinhança e cidade, no meio dos meus primos era só 1 (E ele era meu tio-avo paterno, ele apontou justo um na minha família paterna, disse que a minha família materna era das poucas sem nada disso), ele citava bailes de 1950 onde fulano casado com a ciclana engravidou a beltrana, eu achei que a memória dele era ruim por ele me perguntar 2 ou 3 vezes alguma coisa, mas aí vi que na verdade era muito boa (Devo ter herdado isso), citou um número impressionante de rolos do tipo no passado, a maioria criado na infância e adolescência como filhos legítimos, que só depois de adultos tinham a história real revelada. Depois tentei confirmar umas histórias, e as que perguntei outras pessoas (Até filhos da pessoa envolvida) me confirmaram. Tipo minha bisavó mesmo ""criou"" (O termo do passado pra adotar não-oficialmente) uma filha supostamente de uma mulher que ficou louca, isso eu sempre tinha ouvido, só então eu fiquei sabendo que na verdade era a filha de uma prima casada, que engravidou do padre, seria muito escândalo pra mulher casada e pro padre então acharam mais fácil levar pra outro casal criar, primeiro um casal de idade, e depois pra minha bisavó que já tinha um monte de filhos (*""Quem vai notar mais 1 no meio de 10 filhos?""*). Esse caso minha avó morreu sem saber, só depois que ela faleceu é que outros irmãos souberam que aquela ""irmã adotiva"" na verdade era uma prima, meia-irmã dos primos fulano e beltrano. Ainda tenho muitos tios vivos e casados, então talvez só depois de uns enviuvarem vou ficar sabendo os rolos na minha família, tipo tenho 2 primas que são as irmãs loira e morena, igualmente bonitas mas com tipo físico MUITO diferente entre si pro meu gosto, tenho sérias suspeitas que qualquer dia ainda vamos ficar sabendo que na verdade não são irmãs por parte de pai e mãe...",True,False,False,,,0,1572740318,,1572740778,0,{},f69d3xd,False,t3_dqs1p7,False,True,t3_dqs1p7,/r/brasil/comments/dqs1p7/não_sei_como_reagir/f69d3xd/,False,,1580691326,-1,True,False,brasil,t5_2qh9i,r/brasil,public,0,

Personally, I think it's as good a plan as any. Not everyone wants to have sex all the time and if you want a lifelong relationship with someone, you might as well remove sex from the equation initially so you don't confuse love of person for love of sex. 

I'm sorry about the situation you're in. Whichever jerks are saying that wanting to find a Christian man who wouldn't want to have sex prior to marriage removes 95% of your options are stereotyping men as sex fiends. I also don't think they're taking into account how important location is. For example, if you live in rural Illinois or Rockford, like 90% of people are Christian. If you move into Chicago that number drops. 

Which is why I feel like recommending online dating. You'll be able to look through a lot of people more quickly. I know eHarmony has a religious angle to it. Plus there are Christian dating sites, right? I had a super Christian friend in medical school who finally found an acceptable Christian partner through dating websites... Heck, I think through OkCupid... And are now married.

Anyway, sorry people are razzing you for having standards. Would it be easier to find love if you had no standards at all? Yes. But everyone has standards so it's unreasonable to ask someone else to stop having any.

The English language version lacks many details, it was very comparable to the situation we've had with MENA refugees in 2015, but mostly focused on Eastern Europe, as a lot of it was fueled by the fall of the Iron Curtain suddenly ""opening the gates"".

&gt; Hatred against turks and the like has existed for much much longer than the 2004 enlargement or the 90s. Helmut Kohl wanted to halve the turkish population.

In Western Germany, yes, but Eastern Germany didn't have any Turkish guest workers imported in masses as the West did. In the East, it used to be lots of southeast Asian like Vietnamese, which to this day are commonly referred to as ""Fidschis"" a rather loaded derogatory term. 

These dynamics are also one of the reasons why recent refugees are having a much more difficult time in Eastern Germany: There's barely any middle eastern culture there, while in West Germany many major cities have small districts called ""little Istanbul"", founded by the generations of Turks living there.

&gt; Hatred against middle easterners and the like I think is pretty crazy to claim is not as bad as against Slavs and other east europeans. 

But the ""common sentiment"" is a bit fluid, it's not like they ""only hate this group now"", they hate what seems to be the most politically relevant so nationalistic parties can make it a topic.

&gt; People with polish surnames are extremely common here and it's not a big deal at all, and I believe it's not vastly different in Germany.

By *now* it's not that big of a deal anymore, at least mostly, due to EU having expanded the union, old hatred has died out somewhat. Tho to this day I still have people compliment me on my ""good German"", due to my family name and looks implying I must be some kind of Eastern European who only speaks broken German, and has to be talked to really slowly, with lots of over-pronounced words.

Not like I was born and grew up in this country, you know?

&gt; Spiderbait are an alternative rock band formed in 1991 in Finley, New South Wales, Australia which consists of Mark ""Kram"" Maher (drums, lead vocals), Janet English (bass, vocals) and Damien Whitty (guitar). They have had two top ten albums and another three albums reach the Australian top 40. Their song Buy Me a Pony was #1 on the Triple J Hottest 100 for 1996, and the group enjoyed success with their 2004 #1 Australian hit cover of Black Betty. 

&gt; When you have as big a celebrity fan as Stephen King, you must be doing something right! The three-piece from Finley, New South Wales, Australia, often jump genres from disco-pop (Stevie, Calypso) to mutant dance (Arse Huggin' Pants) - in the course of a single album, no less. And yet, they still manage to rock like mofos (Shazam!, Outta My Head, and - of course - their cover of Black Betty).

&gt; The three band members Mark Maher or ""Kram"" (drums and vocals), Damien Whitty or ""Whitt"" on guitar and Janet English on bass/vocals come from the small town Finley in southern New South Wales where they jammed together in their youth.

&gt; The band moved to Melbourne, Australia where Kram was studying at the Victorian College of the Arts School of Music. The band played its first gig at a loungeroom for a friend's party. The band soon became part of Melbourne's punk scene playing gigs at venues like the Tote Hotel in Collingwood, Victoria. They released their first single Circle K on Au-Go-Go Records with an EP titled P'tang Yang Kipper Bang Uh! following in 1992. The band's first album Shashavaglava was released in 1992. 'Shashavaglava' means 'dickhead' in Croatian. This album featured the songs Old Man Sam and a cover of English comedians The Goodies' song Run.

&gt; Spiderbait signed with Polydor Records and released their first album with the new label, their second album overall, named The Unfinished Spanish Galleon of Finley Lake in 1995. The album reached #14 on the Australian charts with singles Monty and Jesus receiving extensive airplay on Triple J. The album title refers to an unfinished project by the Finley Rotary Club, which became a venue for teenage drinking in their home town.

&gt; Their third album Ivy and the Big Apples was released in 1996, reached #3 and sold over 180,000 copies in Australia. Their first single Buy Me a Pony received extensive airplay on Triple J resulting in listeners voting it as their favourite song of the year. The second single Calypso also achieved commercial airplay, and reached #13 in the Australian singles charts in 1997.

&gt; In 1998, Janet English and her then boyfriend Quan Yeomans of Regurgitator recorded an album as Happyland. Around the same time, Kram and Richie Lewis of Tumbleweed released their own side-project the Hot Rollers - so named as both member's mothers were hairdressers. The Hot Rollers only album (self-titled) was released through Polydor.

&gt; Spiderbait returned together in 1999 with the album Grand Slam which also debuted at #10 on the Australian album charts.

&gt; Despite good airplay for the Grand Slam singles Shazam! and Stevie, their 2001 album The Flight of Wally Funk was a commercial flop, only selling 20,000 copies. The album was recorded in Whitt's living room.

&gt; Spiderbait recorded the Tonight Alright album in Los Angeles with producer Sylvia Massy who had worked with acts such as the Red Hot Chili Peppers, R.E.M., Tool, System of a Down and Skunk Anansie. The first single Black Betty was a cover version of the old Leadbelly song which became a hit in 1977 when covered by Ram Jam. The single reached #1 after 10 weeks in the singles chart in May 2004 (after debuting at #12), and stayed there for three weeks, becoming their biggest selling single ever. The film clip featured a hot rod similar to the car on the ZZ Top Eliminator. The song also made the soundtrack to the Electronic Arts video game Need for Speed: Underground 2. Tonight Alright was released on 28 March 2004, and debuted and peaked at #14. The second single Fucken Awesome debuted in the top 30 on June 28 2004. Interscope Records signed the band in 2004 to distribute Tonight Alright in the US and UK.

&gt; At the 2004 ARIA awards, Kram performed as part of the supergroup The Wrights, featuring members of many other Australian rock bands.

&gt; In September 2005 they released a Greatest Hits collection to reveal their back catalogue to younger fans who were caught up by Black Betty. This debuted at #6 and received a Gold Accreditation.

&gt; The band went on hiatus March 2005 after bassist Janet English gave birth to her daughter and planned a cycling tour across Europe. More recently Kram had announced plans of a solo album to be released sometime in 2006.

&gt; On 18 November 2006 the band performed at the Queensland Council of Unions organised Rock the Vote! concert in Brisbane after a nine month hiatus from touring. Read more on Last.fm.

Googling the address, it's in Bulgaria, SiteGround is a Bulgarian hosting company and they have a datacenter in Amsterdam (which is listed as ""Best for: Europe, Russia"").

For the most part, I stand by my previous advice from your other posting.  

The first thing needed is accurate length and width measurements of both of your feet, which you can then use against each brand's sizing charts &amp; recommendations.  

Of what you have listed, the Next (sizing info from the last few pages [here](https://indd.adobe.com/view/44f0e47f-847e-4588-87fe-ec07e56f72b2)) and the Twister Edge X (sizing info [here](https://www.rollerblade.com/files/15404/15404-07956500787_TwisterEdge_X.jpg), and fit info [here](https://www.inlinewarehouse.com/fitlc/brands/rollerblade-hardboot-insight.html)) run relatively narrow in terms of their width-to-length ratio, while the FR line (FRX/FR3/FR1) are well known for their relatively-wide fit (sizing info [here](http://frskates.com/about-us/size-range)). Though, you state that the US women's size 7 (which should generally correspond to EU 38 or 39 sizing, depending on the particular manufacturer) K2 skates fit well, and K2's skates (according to [K2's own webpage](https://www.k2skates.com/en/support/cs-find-skate.html)) are built true to US sizing and medium/average width using sex-specific lasts (such that a US women's 7 skate wouldn't/shouldn't fit exactly the same way as a US men's 6, the length-equivalent size).  

If whatever K2 skates you tried fit well (your post here doesn't mention which model you tried), the [K2 Uptown](https://www.k2skates.com/en/inline-skates/lifestyle/uptown-2019.html) should do everything you described, with the only strikes against it being that it is a softboot skate (albeit, one with an extremely beefy cuff) with an integrated liner (which removes one avenue of fit adjustment), and it not being available in a women-specific version.  

Alternatively, the [Maxxum Edge 90 W](https://www.rollerblade.com/usa/products/maxxum-edge-90-w/?gp=15630&amp;cp=15622) meets most of your requirements, and is Rollerblade's average-width hardboot option (wider-fitting than the Twister line, not as wide as the RB/Cruiser line (which is said to have a shell width on par with the FR line)), with the only strikes against it being the larger wheel size (and corresponding necessarily-longer frame length) and the boot length being slightly small (Rollerblade themselves suggest going up a half-size from your normal shoe size on [the Maxxum sizing chart](https://www.rollerblade.com/files/15403/15403-07956700167_MaxxumEdge_90_W.jpg)).

Para o líder chavista e seu Governo, o Natal já começou. Nessa semana ordenou que as festas começassem um mês antes e que cada ministério e administração fizessem uma festa. Na sexta-feira ligou uma cruz no monte Ávila de Caracas, que há mais de 50 anos é acesa em 1 de dezembro e iluminou com luzes amarelas, azuis e vermelhas o Hotel Humboldt – um luxuoso edifício no topo da montanha de Caracas que só é usado pelo Executivo –, de onde passou em revista as comemorações de sua organização e dançou com sua esposa.

As luzes no monte de Caracas são a única coisa acesa na noite de sexta-feira em uma cidade entristecida pela crise econômica, que em novembro completa 24 meses [em hiperinflação](https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2019/06/13/economia/1560448585_642664.html), e em um país submerso em um complexo conflito institucional causado pelas reverberações de ilegitimidade do regime de Maduro, que em janeiro assumiu o poder para um segundo mandato após eleições fraudulentas. Apesar da bonificação de natal – equivalente a um mês de salário – e abonos terem sido depositados nas contas de funcionários públicos, os bolívares extras não são nada diante do índice de 35% de contração econômica esperado para o final do ano, a maior do país nos últimos cinco anos. Um enorme gasto fiscal sem respaldo que lançará mais gasolina ao incêndio da inflação.

“Ninguém irá nos tirar a alegria e a paz. Ninguém irá nos tirar a determinação de manter a paz. Serão dois meses de alegria às crianças. Em 2020 vamos florescer, e não porque eu me chamo Cilia Flores, e sim porque temos um povo e um presidente firme para dar felicidade a todos os lares”, disse a esposa do líder chavista.

No começo da semana, Maduro aprovou o gasto de 11 milhões de euros (49 milhões de reais) para a compra de 13.500 toneladas de pernil, o corte de porco típico nas festas da Venezuela, que afirmou que distribuirá através dos Comitês Locais de Abastecimento e Produção (CLAP), seu programa de alimentos a preços subsidiados. “Vou aprová-los imediatamente para garantir ao povo em dezembro seus pernis e tudo o que ele precisar. Aprovado para avançar!”, reiterou em uma comunicação em rede nacional de rádio e televisão, reconhecendo que no ano passado a mercadoria não chegou a tempo para a ceia de natal e foi insuficiente.

O adiantamento das bonificações e do feriado, mesmo sendo uma tradição desde 2015, parece uma tentativa de diminuir o descontentamento que se vive no país não só pela queda da economia, e sim pela deterioração dos serviços públicos, a falta de gasolina e de gás doméstico para cozinhar. Para grande parte dos venezuelanos as festas serão sem eletricidade, água e com pouca companhia, pois a [migração que forçou a saída de mais de quatro milhões de venezuelanos](https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2019/06/20/album/1561032478_981073.html) provocou a separação de muitas famílias. De fato, o êxodo maciço, que nesse ano aumentou de acordo com os relatórios da Acnur, só revela a piora da emergência humanitária. Uma situação que trará ao país o coordenador do Socorro de Emergência, Mark Lowcock, de 4 a 6 de novembro, como anunciou na sexta-feira o Escritório das Nações Unidas para a Coordenação de Assuntos Humanitários.

Nas últimas semanas, Maduro enfrentou uma série de protestos e paralisações de sindicatos como o das enfermeiras, professores universitários e professores que pedem melhores condições salariais e de vida. Alguns setores ameaçaram uma greve geral, uma paralisação que acontece de fato pelo colapso generalizado do país. O líder da oposição [Juan Guaidó](https://brasil.elpais.com/tag/juan_gerardo_guaido_marquez) convocou para 16 de novembro uma grande mobilização nacional com a intenção de retomar a pressão nas ruas, desgastada após 10 meses de tentativas de forçar a renúncia de Maduro para iniciar uma transição política que resolva a crise venezuelana.

#### VERSÕES CRUZADAS PELO CRIME DE EDMUNDO RADA

O ministro do Interior do chavismo, Néstor Reverol, apresentou detalhes das investigações do assassinato do dirigente do Vontade Popular, Edmundo Rada. A versão do Governo é que Rada foi assassinado pelo companheiro atual de sua ex-namorada Tibisay Vilera. Foi, segundo Reverol, um ""crime passional"" e não de uma perseguição política pelas denúncias feitas por Rada contra as execuções extrajudiciais das Forças Especiais da Polícia Nacional nos bairros, como disse sua família. ""Edmundo Rada foi levar ração canina a Tibisay e encontrou Anderson Miguel Machado, companheiro atual de Tibisay, que confessou que nessa casa, Anderson atirou em Edmundo. Isso é totalmente contrário ao que disse Juan Guaidó, que tenta politizar esse fato"".

O ministro afirmou que checaram vídeos de segurança do local em que o cadáver foi encontrado e investigaram os últimos movimentos bancários feitos por Rada, o que supostamente os levou à cena do crime. Em sua versão, o corpo foi transportado em um automóvel, foi queimado e depois abandonado na estrada Petare-Santa Lucía pelo acusado, que teve a ajuda de mais três pessoas.

Tadeo Rada, irmão do dirigente local, afirmou que a família nunca teve acesso à investigação e que não conhecem os quatro homens apontados por Reverol.

Andrew proposes funding the Freedom Dividend by consolidating some welfare programs and implementing a Value Added Tax of 10 percent. Current welfare and social program beneficiaries would be given a choice between their current benefits or $1,000 cash unconditionally – most would prefer cash with no restriction.

A Value Added Tax (VAT) is a tax on the production of goods or services a business produces. It is a fair tax and it makes it much harder for large corporations, who are experts at hiding profits and income, to avoid paying their fair share. A VAT is nothing new. 160 out of 193 countries in the world already have a Value Added Tax or something similar, including all of Europe which has an average VAT of 20 percent.

The means to pay for the basic income will come from four sources:

1. Current spending: We currently spend between $500 and $600 billion a year on welfare programs, food stamps, disability and the like. This reduces the cost of the Freedom Dividend because people already receiving benefits would have a choice between keeping their current benefits and the $1,000, and would not receive both.

Additionally, we currently spend over 1 trillion dollars on health care, incarceration, homelessness services and the like. We would save $100 – 200+ billion as people would be able to take better care of themselves and avoid the emergency room, jail, and the street and would generally be more functional. The Freedom Dividend would pay for itself by helping people avoid our institutions, which is when our costs shoot up. Some studies have shown that $1 to a poor parent will result in as much as $7 in cost-savings and economic growth.

2. A VAT: Our economy is now incredibly vast at $19 trillion, up $4 trillion in the last 10 years alone. A VAT at half the European level would generate $800 billion in new revenue. A VAT will become more and more important as technology improves because you cannot collect income tax from robots or software.

3. New revenue: Putting money into the hands of American consumers would grow the economy. The Roosevelt Institute projected that the economy will grow by approximately $2.5 trillion and create 4.6 million new jobs. This would generate approximately $800 – 900 billion in new revenue from economic growth.

4. Taxes on top earners and pollution: By removing the Social Security cap, implementing a financial transactions tax, and ending the favorable tax treatment for capital gains/carried interest, we can decrease financial speculation while also funding the Freedom Dividend. We can add to that a carbon fee that will be partially dedicated to funding the Freedom Dividend, making up the remaining balance required to cover the cost of this program.",True,False,False,,,0,1572750357,,False,0,{},f6a0kis,True,t3_dqpthf,False,True,t1_f69zfpo,/r/unpopularopinion/comments/dqpthf/reddit_is_far_too_punitive_to_those_who_seek_to/f6a0kis/,False,,1580702559,1,True,False,unpopularopinion,t5_2tk0s,r/unpopularopinion,public,0,

Language groups in the Caucasus have been found to have a close correlation to genetic ancestry. 

A genetic study in 2015 by Fu et al. of many modern European populations, identified a previously unidentified lineage, which was dubbed Caucasian Hunter-Gatherer (CHG). The study detected a split between CHG and so-called ""Western European Hunter-Gatherer"" (WHG) lineages, about 45,000 years ago, the presumed time of the original peopling of Europe. CHG separated from the ""Early Anatolian Farmers"" (EAF) lineage later, at 25,000 years ago, during the Last Glacial Maximum. (CHG was extrapolated from, among other sources, the genomes of two fossils from western Georgia – one about 13,300 years old (Late Upper Paleolithic) and the other 9,700 years (Mesolithic), which were compared to the 13,700 year-old Bichon man genome (found in Switzerland).)


[The first link on wikipedia has this in its abstract](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/21571925/):

We found a different major haplogroup to be prevalent in each of four sets of populations that occupy distinct geographic regions and belong to different linguistic branches. The haplogroup frequencies correlated with geography and, even more strongly, with language. Within haplogroups, a number of haplotype clusters were shown to be specific to individual populations and languages. The data suggested a direct origin of Caucasus male lineages from the Near East, followed by high levels of isolation, differentiation, and genetic drift in situ. Comparison of genetic and linguistic reconstructions covering the last few millennia showed striking correspondences between the topology and dates of the respective gene and language trees and with documented historical events. Overall, in the Caucasus region, unmatched levels of gene-language coevolution occurred within geographically isolated populations, probably due to its mountainous terrain.",True,False,False,,,0,1572752601,,False,0,{},f6a6j1t,False,t3_dqtqag,False,False,t3_dqtqag,/r/Masastan/comments/dqtqag/are_the_people_of_the_caucasus_europeanmiddle/f6a6j1t/,False,,1580705432,8,True,False,Masastan,t5_fod3n,r/Masastan,public,0,

Moving to a new place alone can actually be a wonderful and freeing experience, but you can also transition with more structure by getting into a university program. That way you have a bit of direction and a ""start"" with some structure. 

You could also do a couple of ""practice runs"" by going to a nearby country for a couple of weeks, maybe do two or three trips to different places to get some practice of the whole process of figuring things out.

 [O conjunto é amplo.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/10/governo-da-prioridade-a-quatro-pecs-pos-previdencia.shtml) Está previsto o envio de três PECs (Proposta de Emenda à Constituição) para o Senado: a PEC Mais Brasil, que Guedes chama de pacto federativo e que traz um novo regime fiscal e propõe a soma do gasto obrigatório com saúde e educação; a PEC da emergência fiscal, que institui gatilhos para conter gastos públicos em caso de crise financeira na União, estados e municípios; e a PEC dos fundos, que revê 281 fundos públicos.

 Para a Câmara seguem a PEC da reforma administrativa, que remodela o serviço público de todos os entes, e um projeto de lei que traz um novo modelo de privatizações.

  A primeira fase da [reforma tributária do governo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/10/infelizmente-fiz-parte-da-aprovacao-do-rota-2030-diz-maia.shtml), que une tributos federais para instituir o IVA dual, entra numa comissão mista, explica o ministro.

 Segundo Guedes, o trâmite e o arcabouço de cada proposta são resultados de um diálogo construtivo entre Executivo e Legislativo. “Hoje, presidente e Congresso são reformistas. As reformas que vêm aí foram processadas politicamente”, afirma.

      

 **O que será anunciado nesta semana, ministro? **O pessoal chama de Mais Brasil. Mas eu chamo de pacto federativo. É uma reforma do Estado que se inicia. Temos de transformar o aparelho de Estado absolutista de Thomas Hobbes, moldado para investir na infraestrutura material, através de estatais e bancos públicos, no Estado de Jean-Jacques Rousseau, que possa atender às legítimas aspirações sociais de uma democracia emergente, através da descentralização dos recursos para investimentos em capital humano: saúde e educação. É a transformação do Estado que deve ser moldado para melhor servir uma ordem democrática. 

 **Mas exatamente quais são as medidas? **O pacto federativo é a reforma do Estado em vários capítulos. Primeiro, cria o marco institucional de um novo regime fiscal. O país tem uma lei de responsabilidade fiscal que ninguém cumpre, então, queremos que os responsáveis pelos principais Poderes estejam em contato com essa realidade. A cada três meses, vão se reunir no Conselho Fiscal da República, com o presidente da República, os presidentes da Câmara, do Senado, do TCU (Tribunal de Contas de União), do STF (Supremo Tribunal Federal), da associação de TCEs (Tribunais de Contas dos Estados).

 Foram meses de discussões para chegarmos a esse modelo, porque o drama fiscal brasileiro se desenvolve em várias dimensões. Estão todos lá porque, por exemplo, um Supremo bem informado sobre a realidade financeira de União, estados e municípios decide melhor.

 **O que fará esse conselho? **Vai avaliar a situação financeira dos entes federativos.

 **Qual seria o segundo capítulo? **A redistribuição de [recursos do dinheiro do pré-sal](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/10/ao-menos-duas-empresas-desistem-de-participar-de-megaleilao-do-pre-sal.shtml). Está dentro da PEC do pacto também. O terceiro capítulo é a PEC dos gatilhos, que também vai para o Senado e que estamos chamando de PEC emergencial, porque ela é para ser aplicada o quanto antes.

 Na Câmara, o deputado Pedro Paulo [DEM-RJ], numa iniciativa muito meritória, entendeu, há algum tempo, que era preciso travar os gastos. 

 Mas a proposta dele cuida apenas da União. É preciso incluir estados e municípios. Então, apoiamos a do Pedro Paulo na Câmara e vamos levar para o Senado uma PEC mais completa, com um número maior de gatilhos —a do Pedro Paulo tem uns seis; a nossa, uns dez—, que inclui União, estados e municípios. Assim, damos capacidade de gestão a governadores e prefeitos, e ao próprio presidente.

 Lá na frente, as duas propostas conversam numa comissão mista. 

 A beleza é que damos duas ferramentas com essa PEC. A primeira, os gatilhos automáticos. Se estiver com risco de quebrar, trava a despesa. Não pode dar reajuste por dois anos, por exemplo. Mas tem mecanismos auxiliares para irrigar o estado ou o município em dificuldades. Pode ser oferecido um financiamento, uma antecipação da economia prevista no ajuste. É o Plano Mansueto.

 Nos próximos anos, só vai ter problema quem quiser. Qualquer um vai poder apertar um botão que trava a despesa e chove receita. Em um ano ou dois, ele sai do buraco.

 **Quais seriam os outros capítulos? **Quarto, reforma tributária, que vai para uma comissão mista —parte é PEC, parte não. Quinto capítulo é a reforma administrativa, que vai como PEC também para Câmara. Sexto, privatizações.

 **Qual será a medida para privatizações? **É o fast track. Já tem o entendimento no Supremo de que é possível privatizar, mas precisamos de um processo mais ágil para privatizar as empresas-mãe. Salim Mattar [secretário de Desestatização e Desinvestimento] está terminando uma lista que vamos incluir no projeto.

 **E quais seriam as mais importantes? **Prefiro não falar.

 **Mas tem Eletrobras, por exemplo? **Então, ainda não. O ministro Bento [Albuquerque, de Minas e Energia] quer mandar a privatização da Eletrobras num projeto separado. Ainda estamos vendo.

 **A Petrobras está na lista? **O presidente pediu para não colocar, ainda.

 **Em algum, momento, então, entra na lista? **Não agora. Num segundo mandato, o presidente vai considerar as grandes. Nós, da equipe econômica, queríamos tudo agora.

 **O sr. não falou em desvinculação do Orçamento. **É mais um capítulo: desvinculação, desobrigação, desindexação. Descarimbar o dinheiro. [Devolver os orçamentos públicos para a classe política](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/11/guedes-quer-abater-r-220-bi-da-divida-publica-com-dinheiro-parado-em-fundos.shtml). Hoje o Brasil é gerido por um software. Está tudo carimbado. Já está escrito quanto será gasto em educação, saúde, com salários.

 **Vão descarimbar saúde e educação? **Me avisaram que não tem como desindexar tudo. A esquerda vai atacar. Vão vir para cima. Nesse caso, eu tenho de ceder. Dinheiro de saúde e educação tem muita demanda. Eu já recebi pedido desesperado de governador por dinheiro para saúde ou para educação.  
 Bom, em vez de carimbar cada um, por que a gente não soma as duas e deixa o cara escolher como gastar? Eu respeito o desejo e mantenho a indexação, mas dou capacidade de gestão.

 **Vão somar as duas? **Sim. Vamos supor que da receita sejam 25% para educação e 15% saúde. Passa a ser 40% para as duas, e assim abre margem para escolher onde gastar mais.

 Também vamos reavaliar 281 fundos públicos. Alguns desses fundos foram feitos por um pirata privado, uma criatura do pântano político e um burocrata corrupto —um hoje mora em Miami, outro fugiu para Portugal e o terceiro morreu. O fundo, porém, está lá, com um dinheiro carimbado que ninguém pega. São R$ 240 bilhões que a União tem e estão travados.

 Por outro lado, tem uma dívida de R$ 5 trilhões, que podia ser de R$ 4,7 trilhões: era só fazer encontro de contas. Mas o dinheiro está pendurado lá, e o fluxo continua alimentando. Exemplo: Sergio Moro [ministro da Justiça e Segurança Pública] precisa de R$ 500 milhões para a Força de Segurança Nacional. Não tem. Mas o fundo penitenciário tem R$ 1,5 bilhão.

 **Vão acabar com eles para abater a dívida? **Vamos analisar. A tendência é não mexer nos fundos constitucionais, mas deve ter uns 200 que são tiros para todos os lados. Além da dívida, eu gostaria de convergir para dois grandes fundos, um de infraestrutura, que chamo de fundo da reconstrução nacional, e outro fundo para a erradicação da pobreza.

 A ideia veio do aprendizado legal que estamos tendo. A [senadora] Kátia Abreu [PDT-TO] esteve lá outro dia para mostrar que há quatro fundos relacionados a infraestrutura que conversam. Se juntássemos, teríamos dinheiro para concluir toda a Calha Norte, obra que aumentaria a competitividade, reduziria o tempo de viagem até a China. Todos os fundos são poupança forçada. Dinheiro da população. Precisa ser devolvido a ela.

 **Ministro, não é possível fazer tudo ao mesmo tempo. Qual é o cronograma? **Algo pode sair até o Natal? Vamos encaminhar tudo agora. Mas cada uma vai andar na sua velocidade. A análise dos fundos vai demandar um ano. A tributária, acho, vai demorar, tem mais contencioso. Já tem no Congresso o projeto do [deputado] Baleia Rossi [MDB-SP], na Câmara, e o do [ex-deputado Luiz Carlos] Hauly no Senado.  
 A nossa reforma vai ser faseada. Vamos lançar agora o IVA dual. Unir PIS, Cofins, IPI e esperar o acoplamento dos estados e municípios.

 Examinávamos o imposto sobre transações [que o mercado chama de nova CPMF], que permitiria que as outras alíquotas fossem mais baixas. Mas, quando todo o mundo rejeitou, foi preciso recalibrar os outros impostos para cima. Inclusive a desoneração da folha, que eram favas contadas, está sendo aplicada limitadamente para jovens.

 **Como fica a reforma do Imposto de Renda?** Muita coisa depende só de canetada da Receita, podíamos até fazer, mas não quero surpresas. Acho difícil sair para o ano que vem.

Mm i want to address one other thing.

&gt;But mainly value is attributed to objects due to our desire for them. This desire, in turn, is subjective. A free market correctly places value

I think that free markets are notoriously bad at effectively placing value and allocating resources in a way that i would say is ethical. What do you think? We can agree to disagree on what the most accurate way of discerning value is. I don't like how wrapped up in idealism subjective theory is. The materialist approach recognises that there is an inherent value to things that it is labour measured in time.

The term ""neoliberal"" is often thrown around as an insult by leftists in Germany and doesn't mean much more than ""un-socialist"".

It is however true that left-wing positions to economic policy have become less important in Germany in the last decades. On the other hand there are almost no strong right-wing social policies left, after same-sex marriage became legal and the third gender on official documents was introduced. The closest thing to a right-wing social policy would be the awkward stance Germany has on abortion.

This however has led to a situation where there are no striking differences left between most parties, what makes it difficult for them to mobilize new members. That's one reason why the political parties were taken by surprise by the recent youth protests against the EU copyright reform, and in the ""Fridays for future"" movement. The parties regarded the youth to be apolitical, since almost no young people are joining political parties. 
A party that was able to catch all the highly politicized young people could greatly shift the political scene in Germany, but there is none on the horizon right now. The pirate party unfortunately imploded about half a decade ago after all the tech guys left due to a takeover by radical feminists.

On the other side there is the AfD who is profiting greatly from the indistinguishability of the other parties, simply by being contrarian and politically incorrect to a disgusting degree. This however enables them to mobilze 10% to 25% of voters (depending on state). Many of them are just generally unsatisfied with politics, so they vote the party that presents itself to be the polar opposite of all other parties in the media. Actual racists, misogynists, and antisemites hide within that group and use the fact that they are the only ones with an actual political agenda to shape the AfD to their liking. The AfD was originally founded as a fiscally conservative party that wanted to either throw Greece out of the Eurozone or have Germany leave. Nothing of that is left, after the party ousted two generations leadership in 4 years, becoming more and more (proto-)fascist in each step.

As for your question on the ""center"" of German politics. Pretty much all parties are in the center right now, with ""Die Linke"" being left-wing (but not very far) by German standards and the AfD being rather extreme right-wing by German standards. 
As for comparison withe the US: Most of the Dem establishment would probably feel at home in the CDU, with *Grüne* if the have an environmental streak. Many possibly too with the FDP. The group around Warren, Sanders, and AOC would be mostly SPD, with some overlaps to *Linke*  and *Grüne*. The ""sane"" Reps would possibly identify mostly with FDP, being free-market and small-government, but probably see the party as being too socially liberal.

Applying relationship anarchy one could define a relationship based on sex for the time being.

Adding other elements to it, like Friendship, etc. can work, given time when his brain has matured and both have evolved as a person.

There is also an assumption that every relationship has to lead somewhere and has to follow a certain path.. or escalator.
https://solopoly.net/2012/11/29/riding-the-relationship-escalator-or-not/

Umm, no, they are not. 3G/4G/5G are all driven by 3GPP. There has been more active Chinese participation in the 5G standardization process this time around.

&gt; they are ahead of Samsung, Nokia, and Cisco in 5G

Samsung is very very very small in this space.

&gt; Huawei equipment are relatively better 

Relatively better to... not having one. Read this [GCHQ report on Huawei products](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/790270/HCSEC_OversightBoardReport-2019.pdf)

  &gt; In the first version of the software, there were 70 full copies of 4 different
  &gt; OpenSSL versions, ranging from 0.9.8 to 1.0.2k (including one from a vendor SDK)
  &gt; with partial copies of 14 versions, ranging from 0.9.7d to 1.0.2k

   Forget security, this violates basic software design rules. 

&gt; and economical as compared with others.

Economical, overall yes (more on the radio side), but vendors do differential pricing in this market. I know a European telco equipment vendor who has undercut Huawei in Asia on price in multiple deals.

&gt; The security issue with the deployment of Huawei equipment in 5G is real and can not be ignored. Yet to be proven but it is believed that Huawei may have backdoors built in their equipment can be used for paying on people and corporate espionage. So far no such issue has come to light.

Telco is considered to be a critical infrastructure in most countries. Thus trust is paramount when it comes to choosing vendors. You can't wait until you see an actual backdoor. Imagine two frenemies Alice and Bob, they both do business with each other. But Alice doesn't trust Bob, Bob likes to play dirty, and Alice knows that Bob has the capability to poison Alice, if Alice doesn't endorse what Bob does elsewhere. Alice has two options now. Inspect everything that Bob provides, for Poison every single time or just ban Bob from providing food to her.

Trust in this space is binary. You either have it or you don't.

&gt; India had missed the 3G and 4G buses by a long margins. If government don't come up with some solution, the &gt; 5G bus will never come to India. Even if it comes, the tickets will not be adorable for huge population.
   
Not true. Someone I know and their team are working their ass off since summer to provide a Statement of Compliance for an RFI by the Department of Telecom. There has been more interest from Indian Service Providers for 5G than what it was for 4G. Some has even signed deals on the core network front for 5G.

The way I see it you need a mix of computer science, applied math, a sprinkle of the idiosyncratic ds algos (roughly, ML) and some business knowledge. If you have the two first, the third can be self learnt easily, and the last you will get on the job.

Also, I feel like CS is much easier to learn from a quantitative background than applied maths from CS, so I’d start with a strongly quantitative bs, which will already expose you to CS anyways, and whatever master (either same field, complementary field, or CS) to break the glass ceiling. I’d put a strong priority on the name of the university rather than the name of the degree for the master.

It should go without saying that phds are for those who want to do research - period.

That’s just the beggining, navigating the corporate ladder is much trickier obviously, esp in such an ill defined field.

Edit:
I’m not answering ‘which field’ exactly so let me expend:

Basically in science there’s a food chain, that goes from crazy discheveled genius winning a fields medal from a black board in his soviet era studio in eastern europe to people who can actually answer practical questions now rather than in a hundred years. It goes something like this:

* Theoretical maths
* Applied maths (which really is anything bellow)
* Theoretical physics
* Applied physics
* Engineering (mechanical, electronical)
* Chemistry (incl chem eng), aka modern day alchemy
* Biology
* Human sciences (incl. medicine and finance that really live in their own continuum)

For a bsc, anything strictly above the chemistry line will get you there. The higher you are, the harder it’ll be to actually get a job outside of academia, but the easier your masters will feel and the better you’ll be equiped for the future.
Masters should be equal or bellow bsc, ideally at a more prestigious institution.

The price dropped to $20 in 2014, but it wouldn't have stayed there if the perception was that this was a long term situation. $20 was below the cost of every marginal barrel of production, meaning that the production was losing money. Those barrels would eventually stop being produced as the companies that continue to produce them at a loss go bankrupt. Eventually that reduces the supply and causes prices to rise back to just above what it costs to produce a barrel. We won't see sustained prices at $20 likely ever, sustained meaning being the base price of a barrel of WTI over 5 years, a decade, whatever, because companies can't indefinitely produce at a loss. 

Pipelines won't simply get shuttered, new ones just won't be built. Pipelines will continue to charge a tariff that gets factored into that base price of oil at Cushing. 

And it's not like demand for oil will drop off a cliff in the next decade or two - demand isn't expected to **peak** for at least another decade. And once it does, it'll *very gradually* fall off. Yes, electric vehicles will be the ultimate cause of the slow death of oil, but there's a vast fleet of gas powered cars that will need to come off roads. And those roads aren't just in America and Europe, where people can maybe afford to buy an electric car or even a **new** car sometime in the next decade, but those roads are in Africa, India, and China, where incomes are vastly lower than they are here. Combine that with an increasingly global economy that demands more shipping, and you actually have **growth** in distillates offsetting gasoline demand drop off, slowing the decline of oil even further. Refineries will retool to shift production towards distillates and chemical feedstocks and away from gasoline. Less efficient ones may shutter and the industry will consolidate. 

What's much more likely than the OP comment is that oil demand peaks in the 2030s and gradually declines. Production shifts towards short cycle investments like shale production to protect against being stuck with assets that produce at a loss (on an amortized basis) for long periods but need to continue running to offset the large up front capital investment. Smaller/less efficient producers go out of business. Assets consolidate into the largest producers.

There was merit to that also, though it was a lot more nuanced.

This is revisionist. There was no deliberate policy to architect the downfall of the Soviet Union, or at least not in the way it occurred. World leaders were as surprised by it's collapse as anyone else.

He also didn't architect the policy to open it up, since this occurred after his tenure. During his tenure it was still totalitarian and the idea of opening it up would have seemed absurd.

Thatcher was only around for the first year after the collapse of the Berlin wall, after which she was deposed herself. Do you have any evidence whatsoever that she architected any of the policies you describe? It seems to me that they were heavily driven by the US.

People who didn't back down had their lives ruined, and most just kept their mouths shut out of fear of social repercussions. Now a new large scale study came out confirming that very thing.

This is quite rare for a country to have such an extensive study. Use google translate to translate the page. You can even see the breakdown for invididual cities and regions. The increase is pretty crazy and verifies what every sane person can see with their own eyes. The page comments are also very interesting.

So across the entirity of the Flemish region of Belgium it went from 2,5% to 12,7% since 1990. The biggest cities like Antwerp went from 8.3% to over 36.5%. And that's not accounting for the numbers of illegals. In the capital city of Brussels is undoubtedly even higher. And in schools in many of those cities, the overwhelming majority of kids are of North-African (mainly Moroccans) and Central African decent.

This has also lead to a massive increase in votes for the Flemish nationalist party 'Vlaams Belang', (a pro Flemish, anti-EU, and anti-islam party)who were seen as the big winners in the last election. Who a decade ago won 1/3 of the countries votes but were then blocked by all other parties from participating in the government. And it seems to be the case yet again. But the fact that everything they said came true and more, and how much the public debate and sentiment has changed over the last decade, is interesting. Many of the mainstream and even left wing parties are now giving up on their increasingly unpopular open borders narrative.

Moroccans have by far the highest crime statistics of any other group. But there are also a lot of Turks and in recent years, that's led to an increase in massive street fights between large groups of Turks and Kurds. Drug violence has also been taken to a whole new level with grenades and shootings being increasingly commonplace in cities like Antwerp.

A large percentage of the illegal hand guns seized by Police here,  are smuggled into Canada, from the USA. The main sources of illegal drugs are also smuggled in from the USA. 

Violence falls into two main groups, knife or gun. Why . Simple territory control. 

Italian and Russian mafia groups are still around but they tend to hire out their activities to street level thugs. The Russians tend to concentrate on computer crimes, and the  theft of high end cars, for export to third world countries  in shipping containers.  The Italians are into large scale drug imports  from Europe or China. 

In western Canada, there are Aboriginal gangs, who are centred on reserves, but are also strong in cities. The Aboriginal gangs make up a large percentage of the prisoner population in the western Provinces as much as 50 percentage . 

A further bit of information about the smuggling of hand guns into Canada. We have strict regulations for licensing of hand gun owners, and no body here can legally carry a hand gun in public, except Police , Canadian Forces members and armoured car guards, while on duty. So the use of hand guns is limited to range shooting, with strict regulations about transport, and gun safes at home. 

Here, if I see somebody with a holster under their jacket or coat, its a plain clothes cop, for sure.

O governo de El Salvador ordenou a saída do país dos representantes diplomáticos venezuelanos nomeados pelo governo venezuelano de Nicolás Maduro.

O comunicado divulgado pelo Twitter do presidente salvadorenho, Nayib Bukele, dá um prazo de 48 horas para os diplomatas venezuelanos deixarem El Salvador.

Bukele também informou que San Salvador reconhece como presidente encarregado da Venezuela o presidente da Assembléia Nacional, o deputado da oposição Juan Guaidó.

O texto defende que a decisão de expulsar os diplomatas designados por Maduro é ""coerente"" com as declarações de Bukele nas quais ele não reconhece a legitimidade do governante venezuelano.

O governo Bukele anunciou que ""reconhece a legitimidade do presidente encarregado, Juan Guaidó"", até que sejam realizadas eleições livres, de acordo com a Constituição da Venezuela.

""Num futuro próximo, o governo salvadorenho aguarda o recebimento de credenciais da nova representação diplomática da Venezuela"", afirmou o comunicado.

O texto conclui afirmando que El Salvador ""apoiará o voto livre, supervisionado pela comunidade internacional e que garanta a vontade do povo irmão da Venezuela"".

 

Medida incomum
--------------

Mais de cinquenta governos em todo o mundo não reconhecem a legitimidade de Nicolás Maduro desde que, em janeiro deste ano, ele assumiu a presidência da Venezuela para um segundo mandato, tendo vencido sua reeleição em eleições consideradas fraudulentas pela oposição venezuelana e por parte da comunidade internacional.

Com base nessa premissa e discutindo a aplicação de alguns artigos da Constituição venezuelana, em 23 de janeiro Guaidó assumiu o cargo de presidente encarregado do país com o objetivo formal de levar a Venezuela ao processo de ""eleições livres"".

Maduro, por outro lado, acusa o líder da oposição de fazer parte de uma tentativa de golpe patrocinada pelos Estados Unidos.

O governo Donald Trump foi o primeiro a reconhecer Guaidó como presidente legítimo e impôs abertamente um conjunto de sanções com o objetivo de tentar forçar uma mudança de regime na Venezuela.

Guaidó também conta com o apoio da União Europeia e da maioria dos países da América Latina, agrupados no chamado Grupo Lima.

   Direito de imagem Getty Images   Image caption  Guaidó é reconhecido por cerca de cinquenta governos em todo o mundo.   Muitos desses governos concordaram em receber ""representantes"" nomeados por Guaidó, mas poucos deram o passo de expulsar diplomatas nomeados por Maduro.

O anúncio de Bukele não produziu uma resposta imediata do governo Maduro.

De acordo com uma publicação na página oficial do Facebook da embaixada venezuelana em El Salvador, a embaixadora Nora Uribe deixou o cargo em meados de outubro, depois de 9 anos lá.

Internacionalmente, Maduro conta com o apoio da Rússia, China, Irã, Turquia, Cuba, Nicarágua e Bolívia, entre outros, bem como dos países membros do Movimento de Países Não-Alinhados (NAM, na sigla em inglês), composto pela maioria dos governos asiáticos e da África.

Foi precisamente graças aos votos do NAM que o governo Maduro foi eleito recentemente como membro do Conselho de Direitos Humanos da ONU, paradoxalmente o mesmo órgão que, com base no relatório da alta comissária das Nações Unidas para os Direitos Humanos, Michelle Bachelet, decidiu solicitar uma investigação contra a Venezuela por violações dos direitos humanos.

I met a guy last year and I went to visit him for Xmas holiday (he lives in Europe). We got tested. We did it with out condoms. I was with him for a week and after that I went to Austria with some friends. And I got my first (very painful) genital outbreak. 

I was devastated, sad, confused, angry. I came back home (méxico) and got tested and came positive For ghsv1. I had panic attacks, I felt like my life was over, you know, the works. But then I realized this is only a tiny virus that most people has (oral or genital) and that I was not going to let that ruin my life. 

So I went to a psychiatrist to get meds for my panic attacks and anxiety (I take sertraline). I talked about herpes in therapy. I told almost everyone in my life: roomates, friends, my mom, the guy who gave it to me. 

After a few months I started dating again and I diaclosed twice. The first one the guy said he wasn’t ready to handle that. The second one was okay with it but ghosted me a few weeks later (not because of herpes but because he was an idiot in general). 

Then I started dating a friend, and for the moment is a long distance thing (I’ll be moving in a month to the same city he lives in, for work reasons) He already knew about my herpes status. We talked about potential risks. We still use condoms but we want to stop using them later on, as our relationship advances. 

I have only had one breakout apart from the first one. And it was while he was visiting me. I told him I was having an outbreak so we could not have sex and he was super ok with that and was more concerned about how I was feeling. 

So anyway my point is. Herpes is not the end of the world. We are valuable and we deserve love and good sex, herpes or not. The outbreaks are annoying but manageable. 

And yes, some people will judge. Just as some people judge you for your habits, looks, beliefs, work, political preference and whether you prefer cats or dogs. And you know what? Those people are assholes. 

For me. Herpes is now a part of who I am. Just as my height, ethnicity, skin color. Is not good or bad, it’s just is. I can’t change it, just as I can’t change many other aspects of myself. 

But what I can change is how I decide to feel about it and how I present it to others. 

Is not the end of the world, but it can take some time to come to terms with your diagnosis. And that’s ok. 

But please, know that this is not a punishment and that you don’t have to suffer for it. Go to therapy, take meds if you need them, ask for help. 

You are worthy. You are lovable. You have always been. 

Don’t let a virus make you feel otherwise.

Fine, if you think that non-naturalism has a coherent consistent means of rejecting obviously wrong and stupid supernatural claims, describe it.

&gt; Empiricism is actually true because it proves itself, sillies.

Who said anything about empiricism?

&gt; Regardless, special revelation is necessarily non-rational at the very least, or at least not knowledge that can be acquired through reason.

So you're admitting that nobody who doesn't share your special revelation has any reason to believe your claims, necessarily.

&gt;  Did you find reason reasonable before or after you accepted reason?

Finding reason reasonable is an act of acceptance of reason. They happen at literally the exact same time since they are literally the same thing.

&gt; You, for some reason, are reading the statement that emotivism doesn't express propositions with the idea that propositions themselves and emotivism are incompatible.

No, I'm pointing out that your accusation that my ethics is *subjectivist* and your accusation  that my ethics is *emotivist* are mutually exclusive. You can have one or the other, not both. Furthermore, I'm pointing out that despite your protests you obviously and *admittedly* don't know what emotivism is. Finally, I'm pointing out that accusing my ethics of emotivism is incoherent since emotivism entails a semantic quality to ethical statements that my (and everyone's) ethical statements demonstrably do not have. *Let go* and admit that what you're trying to accuse me of is relativism, not emotivism. 

Do you need this explained a fifth time?

&gt; I could have sworn we were discussing the Euthypro dilemma, not whether or not tautology precludes meaning.

Not a response.

&gt; What? If you know the aspects of God, you definitionally know what Good is.

Tautology. If all it means to be good is to be like God, why should I be good? ""To be like God is to be like God"" does not mean anything. 

&gt; Ok Pagan.

If you be thirsty, fleshthing, drink of me. If you be hungry then feed for I am the honeymaker and the jacksberry. The leaf that feeders on the fleshed ones, thems that calls themselves Christians, and wielded up a hammers against me. Standsy then, in the greens infested maw, and speeders of my judgements upon the weak and writhing manfools.

&gt; Sure. Now then, if we move away from truth, is that the fault of truth, or those doing the movement?

You would need to give an actual reason why some theologian in Europe from the middle ages is ""the truth"", more such than even his contemporaries who, according to most modern scholarship, are actually pretty underrated and relative to him. 

And I know this will be tough for you to hear, but ""tradition"" is not a reason.

&gt; Sir I'm not suggesting you can't talk about them, I'm suggesting that every question you've asked and every point you've made has already been answered.

Then it should be pretty simple for you to answer them. Think about it, if you think you have a morally correct view, don't you have a personal duty to explain it to those who ask?

&gt; I want you to read them, because they are true. Not because they are cool

Actually, you flunked the test on the poverty issue. Witness how capitalism in China now has lifted

millions out of poverty, just as it does in most of the world. Do you see a poverty stricken working

class in Europe, North America, Oceania? Didn't think so.

Poverty is both relative and absolute. It is a relationship to the wealth collectively produced by

the working class. Only labour allied to nature given raw materials creates wealth.

Workers however well paid only receive a wage rationed access to it and are always in a

relatively impoverished condition requiring them to be subject to further exploitation, to

produce profits for the parasitical employer of them..

The rich are an economic parasitical class which does not produce wealth.

Really? The entrepreneurial class creates the conditions for mobility within a free society.

Workers have the freedom to leverage their contribution to the overall effort by using the

freedom of movement to find better employment. Have you ever noticed that the second

thing a totalitarian socialist government does after creating its secret police to control

speech, religion, the press, and the ability of workers to practice collective bargaining is to

restrict their freedom of movement? Victims of these social experiments, whether in Cuba,

N. Korea, Eastern Europe, or Venezuela are forced by walls, water, or the threat of

liquidation to stay put.

When you liquidate or denigrate the entrepreneurial class you sentence a population to

both relative and absolute poverty. Only the apparatchiks attain standing. There is no case

of a dictatorship of the proletariat anywhere in the past or in the future. That is the lesson

of Animal Farm and the lesson of the tragic century where people actually took Marx and

Engels seriously until they couldn't. Even Deng Xioping was a big enough person to

grasp that basic fact.

That being said, we can already see some of these popping up: in Europe we can see a surge of nativist parties (focussing mostly on the reinstation of the Nation State) and radical environmental parties. However, these are both post-materialistic approaches normally, which leaves a big ideological gap to be filled in terms of materialistic critique on neoliberalism. In some countries this materialistic focus is being incorporated in Far Right parties (mostly in the rejection of globalisation and increasing economic interdependence), but in some countries this focus is made by the left (look at Vox in Spain), and in some by both of course. 


What is interesting is that one would expect the left to embrace the materialistic critique in a hart beat, but many social democratic parties seem to reject this, fearing the loss of centre votes, leaving space on the left side of the spectrum for new parties.

Montenegro

&gt;2010 the first steps toward a possible reconciliation were made when the government offered the Crown Prince a state pension equal to that of the President and the return of the primary royal residence. However, the Crown Prince refused due to the refusal of the regime to restore all of the seized property of the Royal Family or to adequately compensate them for its loss. The fact that such an offer was made also suggested that he was in a stronger position in regards to the republican government than was publicly admitted. Finally, the following year in 2011, the Montenegrin government enacted what was effectively a limited restoration of the monarchy in Montenegro. With the passage of the “Law on the Status of the Descendants of the Petrovic Njegos Dynasty”, signed by President of the Parliament Ranko Krivokapic, the Royal Family was formally rehabilitated and the abolition of the monarchy declared to have been an illegal act. The Crown Prince was recognized as head of the Royal Family and accorded official status in social and cultural matters along with use of the royal symbols and the establishment of a foundation under the leadership of the Crown Prince. Funding was authorized, property was restored and the royals were granted use of government facilities and resources as the duties assigned them by the President may require. In the performance of their duties they are to be accorded the treatment of official representatives of Montengro.

Serbia

&gt;Alexander is a proponent of re-creating a constitutional monarchy in Serbia and sees himself as the rightful king. He believes that monarchy could give Serbia ""stability, continuity and unity""  
A number of political parties and organizations support a constitutional parliamentary monarchy in Serbia. The Serbian Orthodox Church has openly supported the restoration of the monarchy. The assassinated former Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Đinđić was often seen in the company of the prince and his family, supporting their campaigns and projects, although his Democratic Party never publicly embraced monarchy.  
Crown Prince Alexander has vowed to stay out of politics. He and Princess Katherine spend considerable time engaging in humanitarian work.  
The Crown Prince has, however, increasingly participated in public functions alongside the leaders of Serbia, the former Yugoslav republics and members of the diplomatic corps. On 11 May 2006, he hosted a reception at the Royal Palace for delegates attending a summit on Serbia and Montenegro. The reception was attended by the Governor of the National Bank of Serbia, as well as ambassadors and diplomats from Slovenia, Poland, Brazil, Japan, United States, and Austria. He later delivered a keynote speech in front of prime ministers Vojislav Koštunica and Milo Đukanović. In the speech he spoke of prospective Serbian membership of the European Union. He told delegates:  
In 2011 an online open access poll by Serbian middle-market tabloid newspaper Blic showed that 64% of Serbians support restoring the monarchy. Another poll in May 2013 had 39% of Serbians supporting the monarchy, with 32% against it. The public also had reservations with Alexander's apparent lack of knowledge of the Serbian language. On 27 July 2015, newspaper Blic published a poll ""Da li Srbija treba da bude monarhija?"" (""Should Serbia be a monarchy?""); 49.8% respondents expressed support in a reconstitution of monarchy, 44.6% were opposed and 5.5% were indifferent.  
On 16 December 2017, Alexander attended with his wife the state funeral of his first cousin once removed, King Michael of Romania in Bucharest, along with other heads of European royal families and invited guests.

Russia

&gt;Over the last 10 years, the number of Russians supporting monarchist ideas has risen threefold. A September poll by the All-Russia Center for the Study of Public Opinion (VTsIOM) indicated that 19 percent of Russians agreed with restoring the monarchy, but only if an acceptable candidate can be found. Support is higher in Moscow and St. Petersburg.  
A study conducted by the All-Russian Center for Public Opinion showed that almost one third of the Russian population favor a restoration as of 2013  
In 2017, a survey conducted by Izvestia found that 28 percent of all Russians were ""not against the monarchy"" The survey also found that of young Russians 37 percent were not opposed to the restoration of the monarchy  
The restoration has been proposed by, among others, Vladimir Petrov, a politician of the ruling United Russia and affiliate of President Vladimir Putin. Prominent politician, LDPR ruler Vladimir Zhirinovsky, is also known to express such ideas. At various times, politicians from across the political spectrum have endorsed constitutional monarchy for Russia, including the former Union of Rightist Forces co-Chairman Boris Nemtsov, Liberal Democratic Party of Russia head Vladimir Zhirinovsky, and St. Petersburg Governor Valentina Matvienko.  
beyond that In 2016 several members of the Romanov family including the grand duchess and Dimitri Romanov were urged to return to Russia the Russian orthodox church has also made it their official stance that they favour the return to monarchy the orthodox church has also chosen to canonize the former tsar's family making them martyrs  
Russia has seen a boom in the number of monarchist organizations. Recent years have seen the release of hundreds of books and films about the monarchy.  
Churches have also been built on the sites of Ipatiev House, where the massacre took place, and Ganina Yama (“Ganya’s pit”) in Yekaterinburg, where the bodies were burned. In 2018, more than 100,000 believers came from all over Russia, to pay homage.  
On July 17th of this year, the Duma in Moscow came into session by observing a minute of silence in honor of the Royal Martyrs. “Reconciliation begins when we all understand that this cannot be repeated, that this is unacceptable,” said State Duma Chairman Vyacheslav Volodin.  
“Representatives of all factions got up, regardless of ideological positions. This is a very important step towards national consolidation and reconciliation  
several things have been accomplished during the Putin administration that is favourable to the cause such as the erection of statues the rebuilding of churches and repair of palaces monuments and other historical sites the return and burial with proper ceremony of the Romanov martyrs the reinstating of old uniforms and historical regiments and the return of portraits of Russian monarchs to several buildings the Romanovs popularity as historical figures has also grown amid a Russian Orthodox Church resurgence under President Vladimir Putin. Tsar Alexander III of Russia Tsar Alexander I of Russia  
we also had the restoration of the coronation much earlier under President boris yeltsin who also attended the state burial of the Romanov martyrs  
Many intellectuals and cultural icons have also jumped to support the monarchy . Two of Russia's most popular filmmakers, Nikita Mikhalkov and Stanislav Govorukhin, have paraded their monarchist colors. Stanislav Belkovsky, the founder of the National Strategy Institute, said in February 2005: ""I believe that the restoration of the monarchy, either formally or informally, is the only choice for Russia, since it is the only way to restore the sanctity of the supreme power.""",True,False,False,,,0,1572798541,,False,0,{},f6dzq2b,False,t3_dr2qn7,False,True,t3_dr2qn7,/r/monarchism/comments/dr2qn7/map_of_monarchy_in_europe_now_with_iran/f6dzq2b/,False,,1580772814,1,True,False,monarchism,t5_2s6v1,r/monarchism,public,0,

\&gt;Year is 2029

\&gt;Poland is the last stronghold of Europe

\&gt;Every European nation has fallen to muslims

\&gt;The Islamic Caliphate has once again marched out of swedistan

\&gt;The kebabs a vast horde of beggars wheezes across the plains

\&gt;They move across the ash wastes with horrifying speed

\&gt;The ruins and ruble stand atop the Funeral pyre of once mighty empires now made humble

\&gt;Poland became a mighty bastion

\&gt;The Polish had managed to hold one of the mightiest fortress on the planet

\&gt;The fire and fury of their guns send all skyborne enemies crashing to the ground in flames

\&gt;The Polish stand united in their thousands

\&gt;Facing an enemy numbering in the millions

\&gt;The Poles faith without doubt their hearts beat with courage

\&gt;From end to end Eurasia burns

\&gt;Plagued by the ceaseless warring and strife brought on by the hordes

\&gt;Their drums beat thundered form afar

\&gt;Their horns sounded in the wind

\&gt;Smoke rose in the distance

\&gt;For 9 grueling days of endless siege they had been crashing against the walls

\&gt;Rockets are flying over head

\&gt;Exploding in the sky

\&gt;They fire wildy as they come

\&gt;Their mad rush to the walls

\&gt;They pound on the walls like mindless drones shouting Allahu ackbar, 6 of them randomly explode.

\&gt;Time and time again polacks cast the enemies carcasses from their walls

\&gt;All of a sudden, a Voice cries out, carrying over the hordes

\&gt;""POLSKA""

\&gt;The Gates open

\&gt;250,000 Armour clad wing wearing Warriors armed with Swords and pikes pour out

\&gt;Muslims get cut down by the tens of thousands

\&gt;Thousands echeod around him ""POLSKA""

\&gt;The battlecry rippling out until it erupted all across the front line

\&gt;Machine gun implacements snapped into action with loud report

\&gt;Music can be heard in the distance

&gt; INXS (a phonetic play on ""in excess"") were an Australian rock band, formed as The Farriss Brothers in 1977 in Sydney, New South Wales. They began playing covers in Western Australian pubs and clubs, occasionally playing some of their original music. The band's founding members were bassist Garry Gary Beers, main composer and keyboardist Andrew Farriss, drummer Jon Farriss, guitarist Tim Farriss, lead singer and main lyricist Michael Hutchence, and guitarist and saxophonist Kirk Pengilly. For twenty years, INXS was fronted by Hutchence, whose ""sultry good looks"" and magnetic stage presence made him the focal point of the band. Initially known for their new wave/pop style, the band later developed a harder pub rock style that included funk and dance elements.

&gt; In 1980, INXS first charted in their native Australia with their debut self-titled album, but later garnered moderate success in other countries with Shabooh Shoobah and a single, ""The One Thing"". Though The Swing brought more success from around the world, its single ""Original Sin"" was even greater commercially, becoming their first number-one single in Australia. The band would later achieve international success with a series of hit recordings in the mid-to-late 1980s and the early 1990s, including the albums Listen Like Thieves, Kick, and X, and the singles ""What You Need"", ""Need You Tonight"" (the band's first and only number-one single in the United States), ""Devil Inside"", ""Never Tear Us Apart"", and ""Suicide Blonde"". In the 1990s, INXS achieved a new fan following through Hutchence's romance with fellow Australian singer Kylie Minogue, and achieved greater acclaim in the United Kingdom. However, starting with Welcome to Wherever You Are in 1992, they achieved less success in the United States.

&gt; Michael Hutchence was found dead in his hotel suite in Sydney in November 1997. Following Hutchence's death, INXS did not perform publicly for a year; after that, they made appearances with several guest singers and toured and recorded with Jon Stevens as lead singer beginning in 2002. In 2005, members of INXS participated in Rock Star: INXS, a reality television series broadcast worldwide, culminating in the selection of their new lead singer, Canadian J.D. Fortune. In September 2011, the band announced that Irish singer-songwriter Ciaran Gribbin had replaced Fortune as their lead vocalist ahead of a planned tour of South America, Australia and Europe later in the year. On November 11, 2012, during their performance as support act to Matchbox Twenty at Perth Arena, Australia, INXS announced that the performance would be their last, though they did not officially announce a permanent band retirement.

&gt; INXS won six Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) awards, including three for 'Best Group' in 1987, 1989 and 1992; the band was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 2001. INXS has sold over 55 million records worldwide. Read more on Last.fm.

The difficulty with favorability ratings is that they don't actually map one to one on voting patterns, or held ideology. Being favorable of socialism or communism doesn't actually indicate a desire for a planned economy. As for the socialism favorability, many European countries have socialist parties without having proposed more than social welfare and some market regulation, calling anyone in the U.S. in favor of similar policies a neo-Marxist is definitely a strawman.

I do have a good memory and do remember history to good and who was a USA and Europe good guys as cherished before becoming literal demons in media, owners of super weapons what never was in their lands despite some general show small container in his hand, only cos they not want to sell oil in $ as put other countries military bases on their lands as have their own economical interests as cultural.

&amp;#x200B;

And i cant be communist(yeah they done a good industrial revolutions very fast and best space programs but other stuff was not that good compare to other systems) cos i do wish that Carl Marcs was not exist as that Lenin with Trotsky was stopped-killed way before they return to Russia and spread their revolution sponsored by USA and ""Antanta"" counties as Russia Empire(originally Antanta enemies) enemies in times of WW1 and after.  

&amp;#x200B;

And that Russia Empire was supported Mexican Empire, not sell Alaska with California lands to USA citizen as not support USA grow cos USA would betray it despite having support from it. And that Russia Empire was less kind to Finland as Polish, Baltic lands(many Baltic lands was owned by Russia Empire since Peter and Catherine times, after wars and some was sold with population on it to Russia Empire by Sweden Queen Ulrika Eleonora) who was ruled by Russia Empire for more than 100 years before USSR formation and WW2, and those lands later go against Russia and some ally with nazis despite Russia Empire let them have their own culture, language and etc rights unlike what Britain and etc europe empires do with their conquered lands and colonies as have segregations.

&amp;#x200B;

But if we return to Stalin, there was never anything close to 60 millions killed by Stalin regime and such was impossible if we would use math, brains and statistics about famines, illnesses spread from official documents of those times.  I do understand where some USA and Europe ""historians"" take those 60 millions where they could come from, but those deaths was not Stalin regime and \~30 millions was lost in times of revolution after WW1 cos of war, famine, illness and etc nasty things. 

&amp;#x200B;

And yeah there was some migration into USA and europe lands what was still possible even without illegal attempts even in early years of Stalin rule what not yet have ""iron curtain"" regime where you cant leave country as cant leave it forever if not allowed by goverment. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another \~30 was lost in times of WW2 as cos of it later, cos after nazis lands was turn into hell even more then in times of WW1 and revolution. It was not USSR who killed 30 millions in times of WW2, they actually try to delay war with nazi germany and japan to not loose a lot more people cos they not have enough tech and weapons after WW1 revolution as many economical problems, and none even try help before Nazi already does broke all pacts with allies what they do have before Molotov-Ribbentrop pact what was signed ONLY after Stalin with USSR for years try to convince Britian, France and USA to  stop Hitler before his empire become stronger, and yeah Hitler did conquer most parts of europe and later USSR.

&amp;#x200B;

Officially by secret USSR documents from Stalin times without any Chruchev rewrites for the sake of his own political popularity and getting rid from his enemies=ex Stalin supporters, it was less than 3 millions who died. 

&amp;#x200B;

In more than 20 years span, i do remind that USSR population was more than +140 millions even before Stalin was become ruler and after him it until 1941 was have a +50 millions more to make it close to +200 millions, despite WW1 and what was after WW1 it still was raised to many millions under Stalin rule, even despite losses in times of WW2 and after WW2 it still was raised very much again under Stalin rule too.  So if we compare we can look on how many was imprisoned, died and executed in other-allies countries back then.

&amp;#x200B;

Then over time they started getting into conspiracy theories and suddenly they're white nationalists. Now they're listening to the more Fringe right-wing like Nick Fuentes Paul Joseph Watson etc

And before you know it that already extreme ""let's make America white country"""" turns into ""African Americans are actually worse than white people""

And that's basically ass close to 1800s KKK you can get without having the political power to go along with it

sure there's some Libertarians out there who only libertarian because they don't actually understand what libertarianism is. I'm sure there's a few others that are libertarian because I have a trust fund and so they want to screw over poor people in order to keep the government off their trust fund.

And of course there's a couple of others who are libertarian because they're either criminals pedophiles or play too much red Dead redemption and think that rdr world would be nice 

But the vast majority and up white supremacists

Because that's what the majority of their media leaders are. most of the libertarian pundits and media leaders are white supremacists. Meaning that the majority of the Libertarians that listen to them will also be.

Pardon, better for whom? 100 years ago China was in the middle of it's 'Century of Humiliation,' Western Europe had just discovered the wonders of industrial warfare and was about to enjoy the Great Depression, Russia was in the middle of a devastating civil war, and pretty much the entirety of Africa, Asia, and Latin America was under the yoke of brutal colonial regimes. Women mostly didn't have the vote, workers were dying in wretched and unsafe conditions, and racism was about to somehow exceed the worst the 19th century had to offer by birthing fascism.

All of these things were fuelled by capital. Yes, even fascism, which despite being anti-capitalist was supported by capitalists everywhere it arose as a desperate last measure against the filthy proles.

Ah but it got better, right? Sure, but not because of capital: China ended it's Century of Humiliation with a successful communist revolution; ditto with Russia; massive public spending ended the Great Depression and invented nukes, which'd put an end to total industrialised warfare; a wave of left wing anti-imperialist national liberation struggles would bring an end to colonialism in the global south; violently suppressed direct action by feminists, civil rights activists, and unions would win universal suffrage, protection for minorities, and worker's rights; ending fascism ultimately came down to millions upon millions of socialists giving their lives either in the Red Army, as resistance fighters, or as socialist partisans. Not one of these solutions was driven by capitalism in the same way the problems they were fixing were.

I graduated with a bachelor of commerce in finance in April of 2018. I went traveling for 5 months until September of 2018, and that's when reality set it. It took me about 4 months to find a full time position in my field, despite having completed over 24 months of cumulative internship/co op work experience. I worked at that position for 3 months, and got laid off when the company announced their withdrawal from 75% of Canadian operations. Past that layoff, it took me 7 months until I found another position in my field - and there was an unbelievable amount of luck and behind-the-scenes communications with people I was lucky enough to know in order for me to be offered the position.

These groups generally aren't Roman Catholic though, but some brand of neo-paganism (which is odd in my opinion considering all of the people who created the source material lived in an exclusively Roman Catholic world, and when these manuscripts were written paganism had essentially been dead in Europe for hundreds of years. Although due to intentional misinformation from various charlatan writers like Margaret Murray many modern day neo-pagans mistakenly believe otherwise. Interestingly though, there aren't any sacred geometry / alchemy / neo-Rosicrucianism groups involved in HEMA which does actually have some historical basis in the rapier tradition

Note that I am personally an atheist, so I take a very objective approach to this subject). 

There are many groups that grew out of SCA and therefore have a very loosely defined set of basic values they may call 'chivalry' carried over from the pseudo-chivalry codes popular in SCA groups, but this bears little to no resemblance to actual historical chivalry, as historical chivalric codes were centered around Catholic ideas related to virtues and vices.

As far as placing importance on ""sportsmanship, hierarchy, ranking structure, uniforms, etc"" there is some lukewarm effort placed into it by some clubs. Some clubs may have a logo and a t-shirt as a uniform, or patches they wear on their jackets, mask, etc. Most clubs have at least a general ranking structure of student and student guides, if not a ranking system loosely based on the London Masters of Defense because that's what ARMA does and many HEMA groups are associated to ARMA (either through being actual ARMA clubs, ex-ARMA clubs, or having been instructed by someone who was in ARMA). Which I personally find interesting considering pretty much nobody using these ranking structures actually studies the material the London Masters of Defense used, and instead is practicing material from Italian and German manuscripts. But I think the ranking structure appeals to the 1st and 2nd generation of HEMA folks who have an academic background and got into HEMA as part of a medieval studies interest.

As far as ""sportsmanship"" goes, this is an item of contention in the community right now as you have people in the community divided on whether HEMA should be considered a sport, a form of historical reenactment / LARPing, a martial art, and so on. It can certainly be argued that among the proponents of HEMA as a sport there is a small but influential group of people who want HEMA to be like the UFC and possess a similar kind of culture.

I see that you think negative feedback is disparaging and that no one is whitewashing anything - you must be on a different sub. I personally never downvote any content (except Spudhunter once.. that guy..) but I do respond to the people saying things like you said in your first couple of posts in this thread. There are a shitload of people who have posted issues only to receive useless suggestions (delete appdate, select all servers, turn down detail levels) within the context of their problem. They often have solid rigs to be able to play at 1080p yet they are told that their specs are too low, it's 2019 bruh! And the best one of course is ""no issues here"". Fucking thanks mate, that's just what I wanted to here, problem solved! Happens all the time and it doesn't help anyone just like your blind defense of the netcode in this thread. You still haven't explained your 'evidence' in any detail, which is why I'm calling you out for stating opinion as fact. White flash on frame 0 you said. Where is your source for this? I can only conclude you are still evading the breakdown I gave you, just so you can continue to whitewash this game. If you think the white flash is frame zero, that means you haven't counted the frames in between the actual teleport when Spart1e's location changes. Meanwhile I already explained the teleport is committed to when the cooldown resets (6 frames) and this is the visual indicator you should be looking for. You've ignored that and tried to say my method for measuring isn't good enough. Well, it seems better than yours since I was able to count six frames my way while you were only able to count two. Additionally, I have to repeat, your criticism of my method is that there may be dropped frames, but you don't realise that if I count six frames and dropped say, three, then it means I have arrived at a more conservative number. In this case 9 frames would mean 150ms. It seems to me you think you can win this argument simply by claiming to have evidence that supports your assertions even if it doesn't.

You said that I mentioned 'authoritative' first which is just a useless tangent. I questioned why you were using cypher's pov as authoritative, *in this situation where you say modern netcode works this way* and it turns out you're simply saying ""this is how QC netcode works because it's using a client-side-server-authoritative model"". The crux of the whole issue here is that cypher shouldn't be awarded the hit because the client-side-server-authoritative model is so poor in general and in particular in QC. It gets worse because you try to back up your defense of QC netcode using the general term 'modern netcode'. This is where I linked you the Overwatch dev update that explains that defensive/evasive abilities beat out favour the shooter logic. So in Overwatch, a game that has modern netcode, this shit wouldn't happen. This is just one of the issues with QC netcode besides the stupidly large BR buffer that allows high pingers to ruin games all the time. Your defense of QC netcode is ridiculous given they have issues even at LAN pings.

And that video of Rapha.. seems you completely misunderstood the point or are just deliberately whitewashing the netcode issues. I used that to back up my point of the ridiculous BR buffer that QC uses to allow high pingers to have a reasonable experience. Rapha is explaining how he is happy to settle for this shit because it lets him play more people (i.e. those in Europe). Guess what, if the game wasn't so shit, he would have thousands of people to play with at reasonable pings. It's a stupid trade-off that suits a low budget, slow game, it doesn't work in QC and the fact that Rapha has settled for it isn't evidence that it works, but that he's putting up with the bullshit.

Going down your post it's sad to see you are actually not afraid of falsely quoting me to make up strawman arguments. You quote me as saying ""*Rapha mentions it here, for instance (rubberbanding)*""

When actually my post read ""Rapha mentions it here, for instance""
The reference to rubberbanding was earlier in the paragraph and was something battle non sense mentioned.

Since you are only interested in scoring online points, there's no point discussing this with you, all your BS comments claiming authority are exposed as dishonest and your constant beating around the bush and arguing strawmen of your own making, now makes sense. Your closing comments:

&gt; I find it unusual that people who don't play or enjoy the game, are the ones who are discussing it most and vocal about it

and

&gt; You (and others here) effectively alienated all the people that enjoy the game and want to talk about it here

These comments just confirm that you're terrified this game is dying and will go to any lengths to negate criticism of it, whether it's deserved or not. Unfortunately for you, all the new players you're looking for have already left QC. The player numbers, the negative Steam reviews, the constant performance posts that are never answered but merely brushed off by self appointed defenders of this game, are all the evidence anyone needs that QC has failed, technically and commercially.


&gt; to me hanging around something you dislike, will only fuel more hatred for it (as in, it's in your interest to be around things you like

You would like that, again you've simplified things to fit your view, but you cannot somehow imagine that the people still posting here actually care about Quake and maybe don't want to see it die in such a shitty way. Yes, I don't like QC because it has all these problems, but I'll still be here just so people can't whitewash all its failings, as if it was a good game that simply was in a niche genre, because I can't stand such lies and mistreatment of its customers by a gaming publisher.",True,False,False,,,0,1572811997,,False,0,{},f6f9ofw,False,t3_dng1js,False,True,t1_f5vu3rj,/r/QuakeChampions/comments/dng1js/spart1e_feedback_frustration_in_game_scrim_with/f6f9ofw/,False,,1580795320,1,True,False,QuakeChampions,t5_3f0ug,r/QuakeChampions,public,0,

Look at Pep’s purge when he came in he got rid of the likes of Ronaldinho and Eto’o who were well respected veterans amongst other and replaced them with our youth academy players he coached while at Barca B. We now don’t give very little opportunity to youngsters and to be fair this started with LE. Even players like Dembele are starved of football because Messi is best friends with Suarez and they’d prefer to play Griezmann out of position. This club never stood for mediocrity, we’re about winning. The actual concept of us just getting walked all over in Europe again disgusts me.

""Dá-me filhos senão morro!""

Essa deveria ser o sentido de vida de cada ser humano na face da Terra: gerar filhos! Mas por ironia do destino existem um grupo seleto de humanos que não querem ter filhos e que até incentivam outros a não terem os seus.

""Dá-me filhos senão morro!""

Defendo o banimento do aborto em TODOS OS TIPOS DE CIRCUNSTÂNCIAS! Até em casos de estupro. Ora... como um filho deve ser punido pelo crime praticado pelo seu pai (no caso, o pai que praticou o estupro?).

O aborto simplesmente não entra na minha mente como alguma forma mitigatória ou preventiva.

""Dá-me filhos senão morro!""

Como eu costumo dizer, não chega uma fada madrinha balançando sua varinha de condão fazendo com que um ""amontoado de células de 3 meses"" comece a ter """"vida"""". Também não é o corpo da mulher e nem a própria vontade da mulher que faz com que o tal ""amontoado de células"" cresça e se transforme num bebê. Por exemplo: você já viu alguma grávida ""pausando biologicamente"" a gestação ou simplesmente abortando espontaneamente por ""vontade própria""?!!??! Eu nunca vi isso!

Portanto, com isso, já conclui-se que a gravidez não é única e exclusivamente dependente da mulher que está grávida! Como eu disse anteriormente, não chega nenhuma fada-madrinha balançando a sua varinha de condão fazendo um ""amontoado de células"" se tornar um ser humano. ""Aquilo"" é um HUMANO desde a sua concepção! Ou seja: DESDE QUE O PAI E A MÃE FORNICARAM E, POR UM ""MILAGRE"", FOSSE CONCEBIDO O TAL SER HUMANO.

""Dá-me filhos senão morro!""

É por isso que digo que as circunstâncias que resultam a concepção não devem ser determinantes para sentenciarmos a morte um ser humano. Não sabemos se esse ser humano que foi concebido possa ser, quem sabe, o ""próximo Einstein"". Ou se esse ser humano vá ser um serial killer... pô, não sabemos!!! NÃO SABEMOS DE NADA!!! Mas uma coisa é certa: temos que dar a OPÇÃO DA VIDA para o ser humano que foi concebido. Temos que educá-lo para que ele trilhe o seu próprio caminho... para que ele decida por si próprio ser o próximo Einstein ou ser um serial killer! Não temos a onisciência de saber o futuro! Mas uma coisa é certa: TEMOS QUE MANTER O DIREITO A VIDA!!!

""Dá-me filhos senão morro!""  
""Dá-me filhos senão morro!""

Hoje reneguei minha família por parte de pai.  
Minha família, por parte de pai, é inteiramente petista! Logo, é conivente ou apoiadora do aborto. Desabafei com um tio meu... muito querido, cujo acontecimentos nos aproximaram bastante (ele perdeu um filho num acidente automobilístico, e eu era próximo a esse primo). Eu disse a ele que não poderia mais ""frequentar essa família"" sabendo que, mesmo que ela siga os dogmas cristãos, apoie ou seja conivente com o aborto.

Reneguei minha família.

Debt repayments are not determined by central bank interest rates, they are determined by bond yields (ie what rate investors are willing to give you). Our bond yields went down every year throughout the coalition exactly because of the measures we were putting in place to curb spending, and therefore investors were increasingly confident we'd be able to pay back the money we borrowed. If we were to increase spending, investors would have increased the bond yields. Quantative easing also has nothing to do with national debt or deficit, and is a scheme where the government buys up risky liabilties and debt from commercial banks to prevent them from collapsing.

The double dip recession didn't technically happen, growth got revised up meaning it was a recession. But the slowdown in growth was due to the soverign debt crisis in Southern Europe, not by government policy.

The euro has been a blessing for most European countries - Greece may be an exception. Take Spain, for example. Before the country adopted the euro, its central bank often depreciated the local currency (the peseta) to combat structural current account deficits. This pushed up inflation to double-digit rates due to imported inflation, which in turn forced the central bank to also keep double-digit interest rates. The working-class population suffered as a consequence, and due to the high inflation rates the competitiveness of the country was eroded, which forced the country into a never-ending depreciation vicious circle. 

Then the euro came. The country is no longer in control of its monetary policy.

The country has become structurally more competitive. A housing bubble exploded and the current account showed unsustainable deficits prior to that, but because the country is in the euroarea this did not lead to a currency crisis as the wider current account balance of the euroarea was positive all along this transitioning period.
