Eventually I sphered all of Indochina and grabbed some islands on the south east but the Netherlands had powerful allies and I didn't wanted to mess with them. Eventually got the Philippines from Spain and after modernizing them I've let them have their independence around 1920 just for the fun of having a new independent country in the area. Annexed Korea as soon as I was able to do and converted their provinces into states so I was able to industrialize them and get their full potential for my empire. Ended being the second most industrialized nation in the world and with the profit from the industries I was able to field one of the largest armies and the most powerful navy among the GP.

Meanwhile in Europe, Germany went crazy and swallowed all of Austrian Empire, leaving a weak Hungary and other states behind. After 3 great wars the british and the russian were forced to dismantle their empires, Germany grabbed all of british colonies in Africa, India and rest of Asia, meanwhile Russia got dismembered into various states and the Soviet Union was formed of what remained of Russia; speaking of them, they went from an absolute monarchy to democracy and finally to a proletarian dictatorship. After I've defeated Spain they went downhill and never recovered, same as Italy, France and almost every other country that fought a war against Germany. Europe lived a sort of pax germanica in the last decades of the game.

China did very bad and made a lot of port concessions until 1910 when the warlord era begun. I've allied with Nationalist China and helped them to unify China until the game ended. India tried to get their independence but was crushed by the british and later by the germans. A lot of new states from the ex russian territory were born but nobody of them played a major role in asian affairs.

Nothing interesting happened in Africa... Nigeria, Mali, Rhodesia and other 2-3 countries were granted independence after the british collapse.

In the Americas, the US lose pretty bad to Mexico, Germany, France and Japan during the first 2 great wars and ultimately fell under a fascist dictatorship, triggering the Disunited States event, the US fell to a secondary power meanwhile Mexico and the Free States of America took their seat as the new american great powers. Argentina, Chile and Brazil did pretty well and were in the top 25 until 1890 when idk what happened over there but Argentina and Chile went down to a level that even Bolivia was able to grab some land from Argentina... in the southern part of Patagonia.

I've been using Ortho4XP and W2XP and so this isn't quite the jump as it would be for someone who doesn't have multiple continents ortho'd. But the clouds and weather...

LR could've done a better job in hindsight, but that's 20/20. XP's autogen capabilities are actually really good, but nobody really utilizes them, including LR themselves. (MisterX has come the closest.) LR just has ""generic American"" and ""generic European"" when they could've gotten autogen down to specific, narrow regions (i.e. each state or EU country.) They could've used OSM data for more than just roads and powerlines (even MSFS's team used OSM to augment gaps they had in data for 3D building placement).

LR has always competed with their better flight model, but now that playing field has been leveled if the videos are anything to go by. They'll have to step up if they want to remain remotely competitive. Not sure they consider that a priority tho, not enough to outsource or commission people to create better autogen for XP. Might still just be a thing that they expect the community to provide. That is, if the community isn't already too engrossed in MSFS2020 to bother.

I still really like XP for it's hackability. It's easy to take a 3rd party airplane and modify it. Carenado planes are actually somewhat decent in XP with things like Reality Expansion Packs (the Pilatus PC-12 is multiple times better with it.) I modified de-icing on the C208 to actually work and do so somewhat realistically. If 3rd party content is encrypted/keysigned or such in MSFS, and unable to be modified, that might still be something XP can be used for. But damn if it still won't be difficult to fire up MSFS.

This is why us economists favour a revenue-neutral system, in which the revenue collected will be distributed to the public. This extra income will offset the increased costs until the market adapts to the new variable of the mechanism and low-carbon industries become more attractive combined with higher-carbon industries actively reduced their carbon emissions so they can reduce their costs.

This argument, that Australian business will become less competitive internationally, is reminiscent of arguments against the minimum wage, regulations, and quality standards. As with the aforementioned policies, Australian competitiveness was not substantially reduced. This is because of multiple factors involved in market decisions; institutional quality, ease of business, capital availability, employee skills and qualifications, geographical proximity, and product quality.

As I stated in the first paragraph, businesses can act to reduce their carbon emissions and cleaner business of both direct and indirect forms will become a larger market. Solar panel production, installation and maintenance will grow, as will investments in carbon reduction technology and the cost-benefit analysis of greater energy efficiency will rebalance in favour of greater investment, as the returns on being more energy-efficient become higher than the cost of investment.

In addition, business at substantial risk of carbon leakage, (Sectors that have a high carbon output without any effective manner in which they can reduce it), can be compensated with a system akin to the European Union's ETS policy. This policy offers allowances to business in sectors at risk of carbon leakage but only to the top 100 emission performances. The market-oriented nature of the policy allows market forces to apply pressure to reduce carbon emissions to remain or reach the top 100 businesses.

Virtue signalling; 

1. *When used as a pejorative, it is a criticism of the valuing of conspicuous expressions of virtue over action.* 
2. *that in using the term ""virtue signalling"" one is ""trying to signal something about their own values: that they are pragmatic, appropriately cynical, in touch with the painful facts of everyday life* 
3. *this makes it ""indistinguishable from the thing it was designed to call out"" adding that it is ""smug posturing from a position of self-appointed authority.""* 
4.  *virtue signalling is hypocritical. It’s often used to try to show that the accuser is above virtue signalling and that their own arguments really are sincere*
5. *its overuse as an ad hominem attack during political debate has rendered it a meaningless political buzzword*

&gt; ... because a carbon tax will make no difference to the climate at all. Go on, tell me how much the climate will change in degrees Celsius because of a carbon tax. Your feelings don't change the temperature mate. 

My feelings do not change the temperature, that is true. I have never asserted otherwise. You, however, seem to believe that your feelings can alter definitions and halt the laws of physics. 

The carbon pricing mechanism is not intended to have a direct effect on the climate. Nobody I've worked with has stated that it will, disbarring simplifications and generalizations to communicate with people not immersed in the jargon. 

The point of the carbon price is to effect a cost to carbon emissions so that market forces can reduce them. The temperature, or Celsius as you're oddly obsessed with calling it, it not a direct target of the policy. 

A reduction in temperature is not an indirect target at all. The most that the carbon price is expected, or intended such as it currently is, given Tony Abbott's feelings on the matter, is to effect a halt in the emissions in CO^(2) so that the global mean temperature slows its growth and the ocean acidification slows. For optimal results, a global enactment of the carbon pricing mechanism and international standardization is necessary. 

In short, the carbon price is not meant to change the temperature in degrees Celsius. It is intended to prevent a change of temperature in degrees Celsius. 

Although, success is not possible without every nation adopting the mechanism. The pressure to do so is hardly something we can apply if we ourselves have not done so.

It's easily exploitable.

The EU doesn't just give out passports like candy. Those asylum seekers - most of them wouldn't have been granted Asylum and would not be allowed to enter the UK. That's why they're trying to get to the UK by nefarious means. 

\&gt;The movement of people has been increasing since the early 2000s. So we have to judge since that time period where we *have* seen criminals and terrorists using the Schengen area for their gain.

Yes, but how on earth does that have to do with the UK? The UK isn't part of Schengen nor do we have a border with those countries. 

\&gt;Did you forget about family reunification and higher birth rates in general?

Well, toughen up family reunification laws then. I'm not really opposed to that. In regards to the birth rate comment, that's true for the first few generations. By the fifth generation or so, birth rates should be equal. 

Between 2005 and 2010, Muslim fertility rate was 3. That's down from 4.3 in the 1990s. By the 2030s, it's predicted to be 2.5. By 2060, it will be under 2.1. The peak percentage of the UK population that is Muslim would be around 14% if current immigration levels are kept. 

Not that I'm a fan of Islam at all. I think Islam is probably not fit to belong in a Western country. However, to pretend that Muslims are EVER going to be a majority is absurd. 

\&gt;What's the harm in trying? Israel may be an exception but what's stopping us from not being the norm?

I'm not disagreeing. I never said we shouldn't try. But at the same time, while this 'experiment' is going on, we should still continue immigration in my opinion. That's until we know that the 'experiment' has worked. 

\&gt;Lmao you'd get more pushback from the BAME community. You're another one who thinks that assimilation works in multicultural current year Britain. We're supposed to respect and tolerate their cultural differences now

Yes, for obvious reasons. I think assimilation does work. It takes time and it can be difficult and there are teething problems but in the end, it does end up working. 

BAME doesn't necessarily mean a different culture. You can be say, an Indian Christian for example or a Chinese atheist. 

I don't think we should respect and tolerate cultural differences that clash with moral values that most decent British people would hold i.e. of course we shouldn't stone gay people. 

\&gt;If you moved a large group of people to any country on this planet and have them set up parallel communities, then the natives are gonna eventually become opposed to it. 

I'm not disagreeing. I think it should have been handled better and we DO need to limit the percentage foreign-born in each ward for integration purposes. 

However, with that said, there are some positives. The percentage economically inactive for Bangladeshi and Pakistani populations has gone down by 10% since 2004. By 2050, it should be in the 20s which is near the native population. When people gain economic power, they tend to move out of foreign-born wards and into wealthier wards which tends to have lower percentages of foreign-born people.

However, like many of his ruthless ancestors, he prided himself on broadcasting his sometimes genocidal deeds on the great monuments to instill terror to the many people under his sway. The Assyrians were brutal conquerors and frequently enacted draconian punishments upon their subjugated peoples, ranging from deporting whole populations to the deserts to die to wholesale genocide of whole tribes and cities.

To punish Tela- one of the great cities that rebelled against him. In his inscriptions upon one of the great monuments **Ashurnasirpal proclaimed:**

**"" I built a pillar over against the city gate and I flayed all the chiefs who had revolted and I covered the pillar with their skins. Some I impaled upon the pillar on stakes and others I bound to stakes round the pillar. I cut the limbs off the officers who had rebelled. Many captives I burned with fire and many I took as living captives. From some I cut off their noses, their ears, and their fingers, of many I put out their eyes. I made one pillar of the living and another of heads and I bound their heads to tree trunks round about the city. Their young men and maidens I consumed with fire. The rest of their warriors I consumed with thirst in the desert of the Euphrates.**

This treatment of defeated cities would become Ashurnasirpal II’s trademark and would include skinning insubordinate officials alive and nailing their flesh to the gates of the city and “dishonoring the maidens and boys” of the conquered cities before setting them on fire.

Another issue that I experience, at least, is that VR distribution is still mostly restricted to US and Europe. I live in Brazil and, despite having a large gaming market here, VR experiences are limited to a few arcades or cardboard/GearVR content, and most people don't want to spend money importing from other countries.

Keli įvardinti faktoriai darantys įtaką šitam skirtimui:
* Daugiau vyrų vadovaujančiose pozicijose
* Moterys dirba neapmokamą darbą (prižiūri vaikus), kol vyrai dirba apmokamą
* Moterys praleidžia daugiau laiko ne darbe (šito iki galo nesupratau, čia kaip susijęs su ankstesniu punktu, kaip ir ne)
* Atlyginimų skirtumas tarp profesijų. Grubiai tariant, profesijos kuriose dominuoja moterys dažnai yra “pigesnės” nei tos - kuriose dominuoja vyrai.
* Atlyginimų diskriminacija, t.y. kai vyrai tiesiog gauna didesnį atlyginimą, nors gebėjimai ir patirtis nesiskiria.

&gt; Tad was an American grunge band from Seattle, Washington led by Tad Doyle. Among the first of the many bands which came out of Seattle in the grunge era, Tad was notable for the fact that its music had a noticeable 1970s metal influence, rather than the punk which influenced most other grunge bands. Although their commercial success was limited, their music is still highly regarded amongst grunge fans.

&gt; Led by Tad Doyle on vocals and guitar, Tad was formed in early 1988 by Doyle and bassist Kurt Danielson, who met while at a Christian Banquet. They previously played together when Danielson's band Bundle of Hiss played with Doyle's previous band (in which he played drums) H-Hour. Doyle had also earlier played in a Gang of Four cover band called Red Set. They recruited drummer Steve Wied (formerly of Skin Yard and Death and Taxes) and guitarist Gary Thorstensen (ex-Treeclimbers) to complete the original lineup.

&gt; Tad was among the first bands to be signed to Sub Pop Records and was possibly the first pioneer of what was to be later called grunge rock. In 1987, Doyle had released the ""Daisy/Ritual Device"" single on Sub Pop, produced by seminal Seattle producer Jack Endino, for which Doyle wrote and performed all music. Tad's debut album God's Balls appeared in early 1989 and was also produced by Endino. In March 1990 the band released the Salt Lick EP, recorded by Steve Albini. The single ""Wood Goblins"" was released in the same year, but was apparently banned by MTV. After a European tour with Nirvana, Tad returned to Seattle and recorded their second album 8-Way Santa (1991), named after a type of blotter acid. Produced by famed 90's grunge and alternative producer Butch Vig (better known for Nirvana's Nevermind, Smashing Pumpkins's Siamese Dream and as drummer for the band Garbage, the album was far more pop-oriented than its predecessors, featuring such songs as ""Jinx,"" ""Stumblin' Man"" and ""Jack Pepsi."" ""Jack Pepsi"" was released as a single, but Pepsi filed a lawsuit against the band due to the cover art on the single, which was the Pepsi logo with ""Tad"" in place of ""PEPSI."" Another lawsuit was filed due to the cover of 8-Way Santa (which was a found picture of a man fondling a woman's breast). The couple in the photograph, one of whom had since become a born-again Christian and remarried, took exception and sued. Sub Pop changed the album cover to a group shot.

&gt; After a very brief acting stint in Singles, Tad was offered its first major-label opportunity by Giant Records. However, Steve Wied had left, joining Willard, and later Foil. Rey Washam (formerly of Scratch Acid) briefly filled on drums in 1991 but was later replaced by Josh Sinder, previously of the Accused. Sinder debuted with Tad on their last Sub-Pop release, the ""Salem/Leper"" single (which featured ""Mud-Man,"" Josh's apparently mumps-afflicted brother, on the cover). Their major label debut Inhaler, appeared later in the year to positive reviews. The record failed to break the band however, even though they were chosen to open for Soundgarden on their 1994 Superunknown tour. Giant Records quickly got cold feet and dropped the band when a poster promoting Inhaler surfaced featuring Bill Clinton smoking a joint with the caption reading ""It's heavy shit"".

&gt; In 1994, the band released Live Alien Broadcasts on Futurist Records, which was a best-of live studio recording. Thorstensen left but they secured a second major-label deal with EastWest/Elektra Records in 1995 releasing their fifth album Infrared Riding Hood. Tad were dropped again in 1996 when the album received disappointing sales. They continued to gig for the remainder of the year before Sinder left to form the Hot Rod Lunatics. He was replaced on drums by Mike Mongrain of Foil. Tad's final single ""Oppenheimer's Pretty Nightmare/Accident on the Way to Church"" appeared in 1998 on Up Records. A year later the band dissolved.

&gt; Following Tad's breakup, Doyle formed Hog Molly in 2001 with Willard bassist Ty Garcia, and 50 paces guitarist Martin Chandler, releasing the album Kung-Fu Cocktail Grip late the same year. He later formed the band Hoof. Tad's current (2008) band Brothers of the Sonic Cloth has been playing in Seattle night clubs. Kurt Danielson went on to join Valis, a project which included members of Screaming Trees and Mudhoney. Then he formed The Quaranteens, a post-punk/new-wave band with Craig Paul, before moving to France. He is back in Seattle since 2008, and has started to write a novel. Josh Sinder has gone on to play drums in The Insurgence and also plays with Marky Felchtone from Zeke in new band Hellbound For Glory.

&gt; A documentary of the band titled Busted Circuits and Ringing Ears was released in February 2008. In July 2009 taddoyle.com announced plans by Brothers of the Sonic Cloth to release a split 10"" vinyl record with Seattle-area sludge metal band, Mico de Noche. The Brothers of the Sonic Cloth/Mico de Noche split 10"" vinyl record was released in October 2009 as an edition of 500 copies and featured two songs by Mico de Noche and one song by Brothers of the Sonic Cloth, ""Fires Burn Dim in the Shadows of the Mountain"". The record received several positive reviews and appeared on multiple ""Best of 2009"" lists. Read more on Last.fm.

Native Americans were basically living in a post-apocalyptic scenario even before the Mayflower landed, because their complicated trade routes were perfect vectors for diseases like smallpox that they had no immunity against.

(Interesting side note: the Native American immune system seems to be primed for parasites, while the European immune system is primed for viruses (which makes sense, because if you couldn't survive smallpox and influenza in Europe your genes didn't get passed on, while parasites were more common in the Americas than in Europe.)  That meant that the Native American immune system was not only not used to the oncoming diseases, but that it wasn't even used to that *type* of disease.  It had all the wrong cell types to combat viruses, while the European immune system was basically primed for viruses even before smallpox was introduced to Europe.  It also explains the idea of the phenomenally attractive Native American; since people with different immune systems from each other find each other more attractive (providing an advantage to their children, who will get both kinds,) Europeans encountering a people group with a completely different immune system would have some SERIOUS biological pressure to get with these new people.)",True,False,False,,,0,1569898189,,False,0,{},f22voqs,False,t3_dbjnl2,False,True,t1_f22q9gk,/r/MurderedByWords/comments/dbjnl2/some_white_people_forget_that_theyre_living_on/f22voqs/,False,,1578019916,10,True,[],False,MurderedByWords,t5_3hx3r,r/MurderedByWords,public,0,

What you're talking about are Romeo &amp; Juliet laws, which apply to teenagers when one is below the age of consent and one is above. E.G. 15 &amp; 17 wouldn't be considered statutory rape because they are within a couple of years of each other despite one being above the age of consent and one being below.

This is the case in most countries, 16. In a lot of Europe it is 15. Those age of consent laws are for sex overall, so a 15 or 16 year old (depending on the country) can have sex with anyone without it being statutory rape. Some places have age of consent as low as 10, 11 or 12, which are hotbeds of sex tourism.

The good thing that helps with stopping sex tourism is that most countries bind their citizens by their laws even when they're abroad. So just because the age of consent in the Phillipines is 12, it doesn't mean that I, as an Australian citizen, can legally have sex with a 12 year old because I am still bound by the age of 16 here in Aus.

[],,styleofzen,1472535360.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_1100pl,False,False,[],"I fell asleep after pizza so finally here's the answers:

#1) solar and lunar eclipses

Solar is the sun is above the moon and when they align above then we get solar eclipse.

Lunar is more complicated, both are on either side above and the person is in between and the moon is reflecting the sun redness.

#2) transits

Do not happen, the venus one is a myth they clearly made that in CGI and they claim galileo or those guys saw venus transits which is just plain silly.

#3) the whole southern celestial hemisphere 

Doesn't exist. There are no spheres in the sky. The sky is flat. Celestial sphere was ancient greek bullshit mythology with Atlas carrying the spheres on his back.

#4) sunrise and sunset 

Perspective causes the sun to appear lower when distant, this causes sunrise and sunset, the sun also has a limited area of coverage where the spotlight is. however this coverage is greater than the sunrise distance so we have daylight before sunrise.

#5) The ""shape"" of the sky 

Flat. we have flat earth, then above that is the moon and sun and planets, with the sun being slightly above the moon.

Then we have several layers of stars arranged in flat layers that are all rotating together like plates around polaris.

#6) Comets 

Seem to be optical because their tail is always pointing away from the sun, unless their tails are magnetically influenced by the sun. I've never seen any so they could just be made up.

#7) Galaxies 

Do not exist. Stars are not secret worlds.

#8) the distance to the sun/moon 

Around 500 miles high. The sun is a few miles higher than the moon, maybe around fifty miles higher. the height of the sun can vary though, its probably higher in northern winter December and lower in northern summer June as it also changes speed and orbit radius daily to form the seasons. The moon maintains a fixed path above earth and also a fixed height just below the sun. This is why the solar eclipse can sometimes be perfect or sometimes the moon is smaller, because the sun is lower, so that would be in north summer June that the solar eclipse moon appears smaller as the sun would be higher than it is in winter. This also means sunset is visible further in December, like the sun is further from you when setting in December than it is in June, as a higher sun will be visible for further before setting due to perspective.

#9) The composition of the sun/moon 

Plasma like halogen lamps.. so you have gas inside a shell that's illuminated by electricity. That's plasma in a nutshell. So the sun is like a bright lightbulb and the moon is like a halogen lamp. A halogen lamp works with plasma by illuminating a gas inside it. The moon similarly is glowing gas inside a shell or even crystals that light up in certain directions, most likely just some luminous gas though. The sun and moon appear to be identical aside from the lighting mechanism and movement patterns. The sun surface even looks exactly like the moon in xrays.

#10) Planets( everything about them ) 

They just seem to be little stars circling around the sun and are lower than stars.

#11) Meteor Showers

Meteors are just bits of stars. Meteor showers maybe optical like comets or just comet tails because we do not see magnetic rocks on the ground like we do with actual meteors plus comets and meteor showers recur on a schedule but not meteors. Meteors are random when stars fall. We see the magnetic star fragments on the ground. Asteroids are totally fake though.

#12) How is the atmosphere contained above the Earth. 

It's not contained as such. Things just pile up based on density, so we have the air piled up in as much space as it can fill and the vacuum or hydrogen etc. is above that.

I'll update the rest after a cup of tea.


#13) The phases of the moon/Mercury/Venus

The moon phases could be reflection from the sun but on a flat sky the full moon would be underneath so it could just be magnetically correlated to the moon. They are both tied together by the same forces although it is unclear whether the sun actually lights up the moon or if this is just a correlation. The moon phase does appear to be facing the sun most of the time aside from moon terminator illusion which is just perspective sideways displacement really, that's a seperate topic I've posted about extensively and I can explain how that works seperately if you like. It's because when the sun is far north east and not visible in our direct view in front as it's outside the field of view, so that we have to turn to see it, then we think it's souther, so we think its south east or something depending on how much we have to turn to see it. This means the sun is sideways displaced at such times, this is not because of the compass but rather is an optical illusion caused by the sun being outside our field of view, messing up our direction calculations as we have to turn to see it so we turn the compass in doing so.

#14) Accurate distances on the planetary pizza 

What do you mean?! We'd need a map for this and Gleeson is not proportional. A map is very difficult to produce without mapping the entire world with airplanes or having access to that raw data from NASA or aerial surveying companies etc. It's almost impossible to reverse engineer from globe as we do not know what was changed to create globe projection from flat earth in the first place.

#15) The ISS and many other satellites visible to the unaided eye 

The naked eye can't even see the ISS. The thing they see in telescopes is a bit tough to explain aside from resorting to low flying drones (which would require multiple coordinated drones and would be tough), or holograms would be easier if they can do that. The flat sky would provide a perfect medium for holograms as it reflects various types of radio waves so such holograms maybe possible and faking the ISS would be the only use case for such a technology aside from advertising maybe but that would be controversial and useless to the government so if the US government has holograms then this is the only possible use case for them aside from a fake alien invasion where we can see the alien mothership in telescopes. Faking the ISS is the most plausible use case and the result would be what we see. It's also cheaper than using drones or making an actual spaceship.

#16) The 100k+ flights and many more ships that navigate the Earth every day using the globe model. 

Yeah well once you have longitudes and latitudes then the shape doesn't matter for navigation. Some of those flights have very weird paths like the flights from South America to Australia stopover in America which doesn't make sense on globe but north is in the middle on flat earth so those sort of stopovers make total sense on flat earth. Then they started direct flights on those and globe people totally ignored the stopovers and started arguing that the direct flight timing was impossible on flat earth based on that Gleason map is visually disproportional in the south even if the distances are the same so the flights would take the same time because Gleason map is a projection of globe so if something doesn't work on Gleason map then it can't work on globe either.

#17) The 50k+ tourists that visit Antarctica yearly. 

They're on designated tours. We had one of their pilots here and they're restricted to their side of the Antarctic. The area they operate within is the visible globe continent region, nobody ever travels outside that and they do not do direct flights from one side the other although that pilot did non-direct flights which he assumed were across. To test it properly you'd need to enter antarctica from one side whilst maintaining a straight course and exit the other side and find ocean, like you are on the other side of globe, on flat earth you'll be on ice still as it will keep going on. The way to do this on globe is to do a V using a stopover, you'd think you've done a straight route across and found ocean but you just did a V.

Also they have races but those also do a sort of V, they start in paris and on a flat earth map they just travel along the coast and then back to europe in a sort of loop, not around Antarctica though. Those races like globe vendee have been debunked extensively by flatearthers as being fake because their race maps are not full circumnavigations.

To visit Antarctica I have to be in one of two tour providers and no other civilian planes are allowed to fly there at all whatsoever.

Keep in mind people have been immigrating since immigration became possible. Humans are unique in the way that we have “defied” evolution by moving from climate to climate and region to region. 

When I mentioned the native peoples of sub-Saharan Africa and the native Inuit of Alaska, I did so because these people are indigenous to these regions. They evolved in these regions. Their features are a result of their evolution.

The people in the (now) Normandy region weren’t originally Norwegian (at least most). They “stole” it while the French were dying of ergot. A lot of South Africans have European ancestry. Nearly everyone in the United States is of a different ancestry, and the same could be said about many countries. 

The features certain countries are associated with today are a result of immigration and cultural exchange, not biology.

Typical day:

* Roll out of bed, say hello to the family, get coffee, check phone to start putting work into my head.
* Get family out the door. WFH, so, stumble into the office in my PJs.
* Sync with my teams across all projects, prioritize work for the day, can kick anything I have to can kick, get balls moving. Happens in Slack or quick calls. I work with folks all over the world so usually this means checking in with the European folks and east coasters.
* Around 10-11 usually have a lot in my head, so step away from the desk to get into real clothes/shower. Really though, I'm thinking through everything.
* Power through work for the next few hours. Could literally be wireframes, research, coding (at the design system level), whatever is needed to help my team move forward. Could be stakeholder interviews, writing tickets, could be competitive research.. seriously, could be anything. A lot of times it's sales stuff.
* Take lunch. Check in with wife (she also WFH). We help think through problems we may be facing at work. Read blogs, Twitter, etc.
* Back from lunch. Try to get a bit more work done, but often get sucked into meetings to help folks think through problems and make product level calls. This is about when clients want something. If I'm lucky, I'm finishing up morning work. Sometimes this could be checking in with my team on a personal level. Not quite 1 on 1s, but more ""Hey how's it going?"" to keep up with their lives because I care. Usually folks are in a food coma anyway, so, knocking off for 15-30 minutes and keeping the team gelling is worth it.
* Break around 3pm, pick up my kid from school. Get coffee, thinking time.
* \~4-6pm, depends on the day, usually in status calls with other west coasters and folks from the other side of the planet. This is similar to my morning meetings, but for other timezones. More often than not it's the team thinking through big problems (like big feature design), breaking it up, and dividing up tasks.

It's a solid 8-9 hours if you count the time I'm not at my desk but am still thinking about work. I think about work all the time, way closer to 12 hours/day.

Type 3 and 8 are very common among ENTJs, but it's usually 3w4 not 3w2. They often have 5 or 6 as their head type, as well. Not sure what to make of that 4-wing on the 5 though.

Anyway, that 2-wing may explain your idealistic / altruistic tendencies. And no, you're not an ENFJ, though due to said tendencies you may get along with them better than most ENTJs if you can learn to check your ego a little bit and see people as individuals with hopes and dreams, not just tools.

Having 3 as your core type matches both the ego and ambition. Don't let fear of failure hold you back, however. Also remember to not take all the credit, sharing it with others doesn't cost you anything and can help you gain and/or keep valuable allies.

8w7 is the standard world-conqueror ENTJ stereotype, but in this case subordinate (to the extent that an 8 can be) to your 3w2 impulses.

5w4... I usually see that in INxP types, and the occasional INFJ, so I don't know how it would interact with Te (or Se for that matter).

&gt; I don't want ordinary people in my social circle, but what that actually means is hard to define exactly.

For me, I want people who add value to my life. I find callousness and cynicism to be among the most problematic traits. Maybe jealousy too.

&gt; Wow, I think I could write a huge list about that. But the types would be remarkable in ways that are generally similar, just different flavors. There are qualities I consider remarkable that are independent of type.

Maybe, but I think distinguishing between those flavors and outlining what a remarkable person of each type would be like is an important exercise, if you want to be able to recognize them.

For example, can you name any smart, successful Sensor or Feeler CEOs? How do their traits and functions help them be great at what they do?

&gt; It's funny that you say that because I occasionally play tabletop games.

Great! Anecdotally, TTRPGs attract a lot of INxx types, and N types in general. So you can meet a lot of dreamers that way, even if most of them aren't especially successful.

&gt; That sounds interesting. Can you tell me what your ambitions roughly are and what you are doing?

1. fix climate change, fix the water crisis, grow more food, and reverse desertification... [all with one technology](http://www.chemistswithoutborders.ca/climate/intro.php)
2. pre-empt the looming protein crisis due to the growing global middle class, and especially the growing demand for ruminant meat in muslim countries ... with aquaculture projects in the developing world at first, later biotech artificial meat
3. develop subhuman general-purpose AI ... I've done a bunch of reading on neuroscience and machine learning (including scientific papers full of obscure jargon), some personal projects with AI in python and java, but need to read up on the math (easy, but time consuming) and get better hardware ($$$) to advance faster
4. get into biotech somehow ... cool stuff happening with CRISPR and bioprinting
5. biological immortality and space colonization are more interests than ambitions at this point
6. futurology is an ongoing interest... but there's a lot of BS in that business IMO

Plus other stuff that's not exactly world changing, and/or that I'm forgetting at the moment. Tons of business ideas, and personal projects just for fun (including some having to do with typology, chess, ttrpgs, etc).

As for what I'm doing currently: full stack web development, remotely. Both front end and back end. Planning to get some work experience and update my skills, so I can move up to more lucrative programming jobs.

I'm also taking care of my dad who's absolutely brilliant, but in pretty bad shape right now.

1) The US is just one ""Western"" country. Even in North America, you also have Canada, and Caribbean Islands, and of course the option to emigrate to Europe. I like the idea that Ludwig von Mises articulated, of distinguishing between a ""nation"" and a ""political unit."" What makes a group a ""nation"" is a common language. So he thinks there's one ""English"" nation, but multiple ""political entities"", each with their own sovereignty. So among English-speakers, there's the US, Canada, Australia, the UK, Ireland, the Bahamas, New Zealand, South Africa, etc. They are all politically independent, but they share a common culture in many respects.

2) We should also distinguish between being ""unified"" and being ""centralized."" The US is ""unified"" under the Constitution, with many functions governed by a single federal government. But many other functions are held by the states, which are sovereign in those domains. That's federalism: yes, a unified national government, but of limited and enumerated powers, with local and state governments having broad powers. So one way this has been expressed by the Supreme Court is that this makes states ""laboratories of democracy."" In practical terms, this means if you don't like the way things are done in Alabama, you can pack up and go to Texas, New York, or Alaska, where things may be more to your liking. This has also been a source of success for the US: states compete with each other to be more attractive places to live and invest. If you look at population shifts and economic trends, for example, in the last 10 years, Texas, Florida, Arizona, North Dakota have been doing great, and have been booming, whereas Illinois has been losing population, and New York has been stagnating. California is still growing, but has been hemorrhaging population to Arizona and Nevada. This would be difficult to imagine in China's status quo, where things are governed by the Hukou system. Moving to different places is certainly possible, but it's far more difficult. You have to either become an illegal migrant, or get lucky enough to find an employer in another locale first who's willing to sponsor your move. Within the US, you have a far more free flow of labor and people, and far more diversity of locales with different legal regimes.

I've long thought a federalist model would work well for China. You don't necessarily need the whole country to split up politically, and go full Europe. (Never go full Europe). But you could have a single federal government handle things like defense and foreign relations, coin money, perhaps foreign trade. Whereas provincial governments could retain broad powers over matters of public health, police issues. The national government could, through the courts, limit local powers where they might intrude on personal liberties.

Mas Allan Mott, que é cerca de 18 cm mais baixo que a média do homem canadense, conseguiu realmente fazer as pazes com a sua altura - ou com a falta dela. 

Você já experimentou ser universalmente adorado pelos membros do sexo oposto? Aconteceu comigo no playground da escola. Assim que eu aparecia, as meninas mais velhas davam gritinhos de satisfação e me perseguiam até eu não aguentar mais correr. Quando elas me alcançavam, eu ganhava um abraço forte e um beijo na bochecha antes de ser libertado ou perseguido por outra fã.

Eu tinha cinco anos e era adorável - a menor criança na escola infantil Mee-Yah-No, em Alberta, no Canadá. Eu parecia mais um boneco do que um aluno da creche. Mesmo naquela idade, eu entendia que ser pequeno levava as pessoas a me tratarem de maneira diferente. O que eu não sabia é que em apenas um ano aquele tratamento desapareceria rapidamente, dando lugar a um outro, bem menos desejável. 

Desta criança adorada, eu passei a ser apenas o menor menino da sala. Eu era extrovertido até ali mas, em razão do bullying no pátio do colégio, comecei a passar o recreio ajudando a bibliotecária a guardar os livros. 

   Direito de imagem Allan Mott   Image caption  Allan Mott conta que por sua pequena estatura sofreu bullying na escola   E, no fim, minha fase mais popular da vida escolar foi o meu primeiro ano, o que não era o ideal. Eu ainda tinha o resto da minha vida inteira para viver. 

A verdade é que, geneticamente, eu nunca tive chance. Minha mãe tem 1,51 m e meu pai, 1,52 m. Crescendo, nosso pediatra previa que eu chegaria a 1,62 m, até 1,72 m se eu tivesse sorte, o que não seria tão distante da altura média do homem do Canadá.

Mas o fato é que o médico estava absolutamente errado. Eu parei de crescer logo após meu aniversário de 13 anos. O mais alto que eu cheguei em toda a minha vida foi 1,57 cm.

Nos anos que se passaram desde então, eu concluí duas coisas importantes sobre ser um homem baixinho na sociedade ocidental:

1. É horrível.

2. Ninguém quer te ouvir reclamar sobre isso.

Eu tendo a não falar sobre isso. As pessoas sempre me dizem ""Ah, por favor. Ninguém te trata diferente porque você é baixo""! (Todo mundo que já me disse isso tinha, pelo menos, 1,80m).

Mas eu sei a realidade do que significa ser um homem baixo na nossa sociedade. Existe tanta discriminação sobre tamanho como há sobre gênero, raça, religião, etc. 

Salário baixo
-------------

Uma vez eu olhei a lista dos presidentes da lista das 500 empresas da Forbes. A maioria é homem - só pouquíssimas mulheres - e a média de altura deles é 1,82. E se essa é a média, significa que muitos são ainda mais altos.

Não é um segredo que as mulheres ganham menos que os homens fazendo os mesmos trabalhos. O que as pessoas também deveriam saber, no entanto, é que a altura é um fator determinante para as diferenças salariais. 

No livro de Malcolm Gladwell, Blink, estima-se que cada polegada na altura vale US$ 789 a mais no salário. O que significa que um homem com 1,82 m pode ganhar US$ 7,8 mil por ano a mais que eu pelo mesmo trabalho. Em uma carreira de 40 anos, isso pode chegar a US$ 315,6 mil a mais. 

Os homens baixos são ensinados pela sociedade a aceitar o que é dado a eles. Quando eu chego a um emprego novo e eles me oferecem um salário em particular, meu instinto é dizer: ""Isso é menos do que eu esperava. Fazer o quê, acho que vou aceitar"". Talvez um cara mais alto sinta que mereça mais, e diga: ""Não, eu mereço 10 mil a mais do que isso"".

Você já entrou em uma sala e se sentiu avaliado e dispensado em segundos? Homens baixos conhecem bem esse sentimento. É quando os termos como ""Pequeno Napoleão"" aparecem, e o desejo de ser bem-sucedido é subestimado como ""síndrome de homem baixinho"". Se um cara alto se defende, é descrito como autoconfiante. Mas um homem da minha altura tentando ser ouvido é considerado inseguro e carente. 

Em um emprego que eu tinha no marketing, isso acontecia em reuniões. Eu fazia uma sugestão, que era ignorada, e minutos depois alguém dava a mesma sugestão. As pessoas diziam ""ah, boa ideia!"", para a segunda pessoa. 

Eu me encontrava tendo que brigar para ser ouvido, mas daí era considerado insistente e arrogante. Não importa o quão relevantes meus comentários fossem, eles eram ignorados porque já se havia decidido que eu não tinha como contribuir. 

Eu vi muitas colegas mulheres passar pela mesma coisa. Enquanto elas acham que a discriminação que passam é apenas machismo, eu sempre penso se não tem a ver também com o tamanho. 

   Direito de imagem Allan Mott   Image caption  A média de altura das mulheres canadenses é 1,64 m   Às vezes eu me pergunto se estou sendo inseguro. ""Talvez essas pessoas tratem todo mundo assim?"".

Mas houve uma reunião em que isso ficou evidente. Era uma sessão de *brainstorm* e estávamos tratando de um projeto com uma linha de pensamento. E eu sugeri,""porque não abordamos isso pelo lado oposto""? O diretor criativo respondeu, rispidamente, me mandando ficar quieto. 

Isso causou um enorme silêncio na sala, e ele notou que foi inapropriado. Eu admiro muito uma colega que me defendeu. ""É realmente difícil continuar essa reunião quando você basicamente mandou o Allan calar a boca"", ela disse, firme.

Ter o reconhecimento de outra pessoa ajudou a confirmar minhas suspeitas de que ele me tratava mal sem nenhuma boa razão.

E quando o assunto é namoro?

A realidade é que, como um homem baixo, você pode esperar que 8 a cada 10 mulheres vão te dispensar à primeira vista como potencial parceiro sexual. E as chances são de que as 2 que sobrarem vão te dar apenas alguns minutos de conversa antes de começarem a inventar desculpas. 

Quando eu digo para minhas amigas que as mulheres não gostam de namorar homens baixos, elas sempre dizem a mesma coisa: ""Não é verdade. Aposto que tem várias mulheres que adoram homens baixos. ""

""Você já namorou algum""?, eu pergunto.

""Bem, não..."", elas dizem.

""E namoraria?""

O que se segue é um silêncio constrangedor. 

De acordo com o *Freakonomics*, bestseller do Steven Levitt e Stephen Dubner, homens baixos têm menor probabilidade de receber respostas em sites de namoro em comparação a qualquer outro grupo demográfico. 

O fato de que a minha média de encontros online no meu perfil é de um por ano quebra as barreiras graças à força da minha ótima personalidade. 

E, claro, tem as exceções que todo mundo gosta de citar. 

""As mulheres amavam o Prince e ele era baixinho""!

Ótimo, então eu só tenho que passar a vida usando saltos altíssimos stiletto, ser um gênio musical e ser o maior artista da geração dele. 

   Direito de imagem Getty Images   Image caption  O músico Prince compensava a baixa estatura usando sapatos com salto alto   Eu ouço falar de homens que são mais baixos e que se sentem muito desconfortáveis perto de mulheres altas. Eu acho que mulheres altas têm uma experiência parecida. Eu tenho amigas altas que dizem que os caras com quem elas estão saindo que nunca lhes deixam usar salto alto"", e que ""o parceiro ficava com vergonha das pessoas nos olhando"" Não eu. Se minha alma gêmea tivesse 1,80 m, não ia me incomodar nem um pouco. 

A maioria das pessoas sem notar associa altura à força, inteligência e dominância. E por consequência, assume que pessoas mais altas são melhores líderes que seus pares baixos.

Eu admito que às vezes eu acho que faço a vida de homem baixo parecer pior do que é. Minha vida seria mais fácil se eu fosse alto na escola no ensino médio? Provavelmente. Mas não é que a minha vida tenha sido de dor e de misérias infinitas. 

Eu sou quem eu sou por causa da minha altura. E me deu a disposição para correr riscos que eu chamo de ""síndrome de paraquedas"".

Em uma situação assustadora - por mais que eu esteja assustado, como todo mundo, minha reação frequente é: ""Bem, eu estou na porta deste avião, posso pular. O que pior pode acontecer?""

Uma vez quando eu estava começando em um trabalho, a empresa fez uma reunião com toda a equipe no Edmonton's Northlands Coliseum, uma arena gigante de esportes e shows. Era uma tradição que todo novo empregado passasse por uma iniciação quando entrava na companhia. O Bruno Mars, 7 cm mais alto que eu, ia tocar lá, então nos pediam para cantar uma das músicas dele. No palco, todo mundo falava ""Nós não vamos fazer isso"", e todos olhavam para baixo.

Eu nunca ouvi uma música do Bruno Mars na minha vida, então eu pesquisei algumas letras no Google e peguei o microfone. Eu não sabia o tom, mas cantei o refrão de *Locked Out of Heaven* para todas aquelas pessoas com quem eu ia trabalhar. 

Como estava disposto a fazer isso na frente de todo mundo, o presidente da empresa imediatamente me conheceu pelo primeiro nome. E eu tive a confiança para fazer isso porque eu tenho essa determinação de transcender a expectativa das pessoas em relação a mim. Eles podem esperar que eu fique quieto e me esconda, mas eu vou pular do avião.

Espero que meu paraquedas funcione.

Pode ser também porque seja baixo que agora eu sou um escritor. Já mencionei que caras baixos não são levados a sério quando falam, então escrever é uma chance real de me expressar e ser ouvido. É meu real talento. Eu comecei escrevendo histórias de outras pessoas, e embora meus livros nunca tenham se tornado bestsellers nacionais, eu sempre encontro pessoas que cresceram os lendo e isso me dá um sentimento especial.

Have you heard of Tenochtitlan? It was the capital of the Aztec empire. Over 5 square miles, it was built on a lake and had bridges, causeways, canals, aqueducts, saunas, floating gardens, and freaking pyramids. 

Do you seriously believe that the Aztecs were cool with the colonists just coming into their incredibly advanced city and taking it over, because they had no sense of land ownership? 

Even in North America, the native populations still valued their territory. 

However, unlike the European Colonists and later the American Expansionists, and including today's greedy America Capitalists, the native peoples actually valued the land for what it was, not for what they could rip, grind, and suck from it. 

They protected and honored the land, recognized that the land did not solely belong to them, but it belonged to itself, its wildlife, and all that would seek to make a home with the land and not just exploit it.

The whole ""Indians don't understand land ownership"" lies, were simply ways for the colonists to whitewash and justify the mass execution and genocide of the native inhabitants of a resource rich environment they wanted.",True,False,False,,,0,1569903723,,False,0,{},f232f6f,False,t3_dbjnl2,False,True,t1_f230gf6,/r/MurderedByWords/comments/dbjnl2/some_white_people_forget_that_theyre_living_on/f232f6f/,False,,1578023144,6,True,[],False,MurderedByWords,t5_3hx3r,r/MurderedByWords,public,0,

They do exist in physical shops but not all of them. For me there's perhaps a one-third chance that they have nothing at all, and it's not unusual for them to tell me that 45s are the biggest they stock so you might have even more difficulty with 46es. Even if they do have anything the selection will be very limited - maybe one or two pairs - so it might be hard to find something you like. 
It does seem to be easier to find bigger sports shoes compared to formal shoes, because Western brands (Nike, Adidas) dominate the high-ish end of the market. 

The sizing for local brands can also be a bit creative so definitely try them on first. A lot of the time they run to long but narrow, so you have a choice between having your feet squeezed uncomfortably and buying a bigger size that's long like clown shoes. I don't know if it's a physical difference between Chinese and European foot shapes or just good old-fashioned chabuduo. 

Online has more selection, there are lots of shops on Taobao that specialise in bigger shoes. But the sizing issues still apply and its a lot of hassle to send things back.

For work shoes there's also an issue that mid-range foreign brands are positioned as luxury products here, so you'll pay twice as much for a pair of Clarks as you would in England.

There are ""fiat-to-crypto"" exchanges, and there are ""crypto-to-crypto"" exchanges.  Some exchanges try to do both, and end up doing neither particularly well.


If you are looking to Buy bitcoin with fiat money, then the methods available will differ based on a few factors:

- Where are you located (country)?
- How much are you looking to buy?
- What payment methods do you have available?
- How soon do you need access to the proceeds?
- Is financial privacy important?

I think RobinHood is U.S. only, so going to assume you are U.S. 

Here's a useful comparison of exchanges in which you can filter on payment method:

- https://exchangewar.info  &lt;-- Filter box for currency (e.g., EUR) or payment method (e.g., VISA)

 First time buyers may like the convenience of an online store that sells bitcoin and accepts debit and/or credit card.  (e.g., Rebiton [**NO-KYC**], CEX.io, Coinify, CoinCorner, Jubiter, Bittylicious, BitIreleand, Kuna.io Money, LiteBit.eu, Conio.com, GetSatsoshi.org ([⚡](https://lightningnetworkstores.com/wallets)), Cash App and CoinMama). You can buy BTC on Cash App without ID but you won't be able to withdraw them until you are KYC verified.

You can purchase online using a No-KYC online store, paying by depositing cash in a bank account or through Moneygram/Western Union:

- [BitQuick QuickBuy](https://www.bitquick.co/quick-buy) [**NO-KYC** (when trx amount is under $400)]

There are also physical locations where there are Bitcoin ATMs and other vending/voucher methods.  For example, in the U.S. there is:

- https://coinatmradar.com  &lt;-- Some will require Identity verification/KYC, others just a phone number, or nothing at all
- https://www.coinstar.com/bitcoin (with [2,200+ locations in the U.S.](https://coinme.com/kiosks))  &lt;-- Identity verification/KYC
- https://libertyx.com/a/buy/locations &lt;-- Cashier (cash), and/or Kiosk (debit card)

Using gift cards, there is [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co) for paying with a non-reloadable, prepaid GIFT card (VISA/Mastercard/AMEX/Discover),  [CryptoVoucher.io](https://cryptovoucher.io) for paying with gift cards for numerous brands, and [BitOf](https://bitof.io/) for paying with Amazon UK gift cards).

Otherwise, an in-person cash trade or an online trade using a P2P trading exchange may possibly be your next best option:

[],,ReaperReader,1406210064.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_hjwjr,False,False,[],"There's two parts to answering this question, one part being to note that there was still coerced labour, and the other part being to discuss why there wasn't more coerced labour.

**What coerced labour was there in Britain in the 18th and 19th centuries**

Britain did see coerced labour to some extent. For a start, there was coerced labour in the more dangerous jobs - think of Oliver Twist being sold to a chimny sweep, or girls being forced into prostitution (in a time of widespread syphillis and no antibiotics, this was very dangerous). In Scotland, a 1606 act had placed Scottish coal workers in basically slavery to their employer, and ruled that vagabonds could be forced into that compulsory labour. This was only ended by an act in 1799. Britain also, up until 1875, retained Master and Servant law gave employers the ability to criminally (as opposed to civilly) punish workers for breach of contract, and there were contracts of indentured servitude. 

**Why did Britain not see widespread coerced labour during the Industrial Revolution**

I don't know any academic work that has been done specifically on this for Great Britain during the Industrial Revolution, but the classic article on the economics of slavery, and coerced labour (eg serfdom, indentured servitude) more generally was given by Evsey Domar, in 1969, (though Domar notes several authors, particularly Kliuchevsky, already had the idea). Domar's argument is that slavery only makes sense if it saves money over paying someone a wage. If you enslave someone and you want them to live more than a few months, you have to feed, house and shelter them, and you also have the costs of capturing them and stopping them from running away. Therefore slavery only makes economic sense if prevailing wages are substantially above subsistence cost - or the labour is highly dangerous or miserable (thus coal miners, chimney sweeps, prostitutes).

Domar used the example of the introduction of serfdom into Russia. To quote ""before 1550 Russian peasants were free men; a hundred years later they were serfs"". Domar relates this adoption of serfdom mainly to the Russian state's demand for more men for military service and the conquest of the steppes and thus their opening up to Russian farming. Therefore the demand for labour, relative to land, went up (Domar also notes a number of other factors, there's an ungated copy of his article linked below, I suggest reading it).

Domar also discusses Western Europe's serfdom, with the emergence of serfdom in the late Roman Empire and its decline by 1300. As the population of Western Europe grew towards the end of the 13th century, serfdom declined (though Domar puzzled over the failure of serfdom to be re-established after the population losses of the Black Death).

England in the 18th century was in a state where there was lots of labour available. England had an Agricultural Revolution between the mid 16th and late 19th century, and its last peacetime famine in the 1620s (arguably due not just to the improvement in agricultural production but also due to relatively effective enforcement of the poor laws), and there was a rapid growth in population alongside it, Maddison's long-term economic series estimates that British population went from 8.5m in 1700 to 21.2 million in 1820. There is plenty of evidence that GDP per capita also grew over this period, but this was not evenly distributed. There's a lively debate going on at the moment about how high British wages for labourers were over this period, but it certainly wasn't particularly high, not much above subsistence. A vivid example of low wages is actually a very old one - Adam Smith, in his *The Wealth of Nations* (1776) writes (in the context of what is a necessity and what is a luxury)

&gt;Custom, in the same manner, has rendered leather shoes a necessary of life in England. The poorest creditable person, of either sex, would be ashamed to appear in public without them. In Scotland, custom has rendered them a necessary of life to the lowest order of men; but not to the same order of women, who may, without any discredit, walk about barefooted. In France, they are necessaries neither to men nor to women; the lowest rank of both sexes appearing there publicly, without any discredit, sometimes in wooden shoes, and sometimes barefooted.

While obviously being able to afford wearing shoes during an English winter (let alone a Scottish one) is a valuable thing, it's not exactly a sign of high wages for free labour. 


There is other evidence for a lack of demand for coerced labour in England - the British authorities first sent convicts to North America and then resorted to colonising Australia to have somewhere to send criminals - they were willing to pay the costs of shipping people half way round the world by sailing ships rather than enslaving them at home.


So in England during the Industrial Revolution, a manufacturer didn't need to enslave people, they could hire them cheaply. 

Meanwhile, in the North American colonies, land was ample and labour was scarce, so slavery made economic sense as per Domar's argument.


**Why wasn't there more coerced labour?**

All this does raise the question of why Britain didn't reintroduce widespread coerced labour as wages rose during the 19th century, and why the northern US states abolished slavery. Laegerloff Nils-petter (2009) mentions the argument that perhaps industrial production is more care-intensive and the supervision costs of slavery got too high - think of stories of forced labourers under the Nazi regimes deliberately sabotaging artillery shells. Against this argument though there is evidence that slave societies used slaves in skilled positions. 

Another possibility is that the inclusive social institutions needed to support industrialisation, such as relatively less-corrupt legal systems and protection of property rights, also bring about greater attention to the interests of workers in legal procedures, and protection of the property rights of the majority of the population (see Miomir and Milica, 2018 for a summary of the research). There is also some empirical evidence that people in more market integrated societies cooperate more and show more concern for their partner's well being in economic games (Henrich, 2001).  [Note I am aware that this argument about morality contradicts much academic literature which associates markets and capitalism with exploitation and selfishness.  My understanding is that the key difference is the counter-factual, the work I'm drawing on compares what happened and happens empirically in industrialising economies to what happened and happens in other systems, as opposed to comparing what could be.] 

It's noticeable that the abolitionist movement and the realisation of the horrors of slavery became widespread from the late 18th century in Britian, northwest Europe and northern USA. Sadly, the profitably of slavery in the southern states and the cognitive dissonance between the economic motive and the moral horrors may have driven much of the viciousness of US racism as slave owners sought to convince themselves against all evidence that their slaves were naturally subhuman. And it is important not to exaggerate the scale or spread of any change in values. This was far from universal, and often subject to human hypocrisy. 

Or it could be due to some third factor that no one has thought of. There's a shortage of academic research into why *not* slavery.


**In summary**


Widespread slavery didn't happen in Britain at the start of the Industrial Revolution because labour was cheap and plentiful compared to the American colonies. That said there was coerced labour in particularly dangerous jobs. There is a puzzle that rising wages didn't lead to the reintroduction of coerced labour, this may be due to the changed nature of work or it may be due to cultural values charging to a more inclusive basis as part of the same processes that formed the institutional basis for the Industrial Revolution and subsequent economic development.

Sweet hint. But, actually, we don't know the counter factual.

I recommend considering some humility. The rates were kept on hold for years and *nothing* happened. Cutting the rates has had zero effect on inflation and wages, so how can you claim that not cutting them had would've had an effect?

&gt; We’re at +0.50% by last measurement, very different to 0%

So in Europe, everything changed at 0%? Or negative, even? I didn't check today, is Europe suddenly a growth economy?

&gt; If you’re going to deny the usefulness of what is perhaps the most universally renowned economic tool at a central bank’s disposal, at least explain your genius ideas man.

It worked. Until it didn't. Central banks around the world are in uncharted territory. They keep pushing the same lever, it isn't working. It's basically cargo culting at this point.

I don't have an alternative, but I think we need to acknowledge that the tools that once worked, are not working in current conditions. Worse, they may be making the financial system more fragile by encouraging unprecedented amounts of debt to be taken on.

&gt; Maybe apply for a job on the RBA’s board too dude, they clearly need your help.

Maybe interest rates are an inappropriate tool to solve weak economic growth in modern developed economies?

EDIT:

LOL I missed this 😂😂😂

&gt; One measure we have (the performance of the ASX) does in fact indicate strong growth as an immediate result of the rate cuts.

We all know rate cuts inflate asset prices. This - the massive growth in wealth inequality - is perhaps the biggest failure of global rate cutting over the last decade. It has not made economies stronger. It has made them more fragile, more indebted, and more prone to sharp corrections.

Today let's talk about the **HRE.** [Earlier in the year](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/eu4-development-diary-30th-of-april-2019.1172576/), I touched on the Empire, and want to expand a bit more on what you can expect to see and do with Germany and friends in 1.30. As we've said before, much of the HRE mechanically exists in the game, and has continued to exist in its current form, as it does a great job of bringing relative rigidity to central Europe, and a good bulwark to an otherwise overly formidable French or Scandinavian threat, or more terrifying indeed, Ottoman invasion.

To that end, 1.30 will still have the Holy Roman Empire's base mechanics in their glory, save some smaller Quality of Life changes (such as no longer adding provinces to the Empire individually). The meat and potatoes of what you can expect in Early Modern Germany come by way of **HRE Reforms** and **Imperial Incidents**

Firstly, the **reforms** available for the Holy Roman Empire have been split into general reforms, Decentralisation reforms and Centralisation reforms. Some will look familiar to a seasoned HRE player. Others, less so.

General Reforms:

* Call for Reichsreform
   * Empire Provinces: -5% Local Construction Cost
   * Emperor: Imperial Ban CB
* Institute Reichsregiment
   * Emperor: +1 Diplomats, +1 Diplomatic reputation
   * Empire Provinces: -2 Local Unrest
* Absolute Reichsstabilität
   * Emperor: gets a \[REDACTED\] that will \[VERY REDACTED\]
   * Empire Provinces: -25% Local State Maintenance
* Enact Gemeiner Pfennig
   * Emperor per Prince: +0.5 Yearly Tax income
   * Princes: +1 Diplomatic reputation
* Perpetual Diet
   * Needed to take one of the specific paths
   * Event that puts the location down for the “Permanent Diet” in an Imperial Free City
   * Permanent Diet is a triggered province modifier with some nice boons for the province. Is only valid if province is part of the Empire. If not a triggered modifier is enabled that gives -50% IA Gain.
   * Double Imperial Authority from Free Cities
* Create the Landsknechtswesen
   * All Princes: Mercenary Companies who have their home in an Imperial Province are 50% cheaper.
* Ewiger Landfriede
   * Emperor: +0.5 Yearly Prestige
   * Princes: -5% Tech cost
   * Empire Provinces: +10% Institution Spread
   * Emperor gets call to Arms for any war within the Empire as if it was done without CB.

Once the Emperor Passes the Perpetual Diet, they will be able to pass further reforms to either strengthen the decentralised Empire, or seek to centralise all power for themselves. Players have long wondered if they should stop short of completing the existing HRE reform path in order to preserve their Vassal Swarm, a highly enjoyable way of playing, or to unite the HRE under one flag. Now they will be able to choose between this decentralised power or centralising uniting under nation, with about 5 reforms each that play into either playstyle.

*And maybe a player will have to weigh up ?missions? against vassal swarm tactics*

The other thing for us to look into today are **Imperial Incidents**. One thing we wanted to do was to make the Empire feel alive and rife with bickering princes. To that end, we have rolled some existing occurrences throughout EU4 and History, as well as many others, into a system that has the HRE both create and react to issues in Central Europe and the immediate vicinity.

When the conditions are ripe, an Imperial Incident can trigger for the Empire. All member states will be informed of the incident, and it will prominently be displayed in the HRE interface. The Emperor will then have 6 months to make a decision on the incident, with wide-ranging knock-on effects.

To take a familiar example, the fate of Burgundy will be more fluid, with the circling vultures being more involved. Burgundy may seek support from the HRE as they see the writing on the wall, starting an Imperial Incident where the Emperor will have to choose between:

* Negotiate with France
   * France gains the parts of Burgundy that are in the French Region.
* Integrate Burgundy into the Empire
   * Burgundy becomes an Imperial Prince
   * Gives an event to France that gives them an option to start a Succession War on Burgundy(and thus by extension the Emperor) with French land occupied.
   * Princes around Burgundy becomes irritated with Emperor.
* Just keep the PU with Burgundy
   * Nevers becomes vassal of France, France gets an option to start a Restoration of Union War on Burgundy(and thus by extension the Emperor) with French land occupied.

All incidents, and the path that the Emperor pursued will be visible in the HRE interface, so curious players can see what choices the Emperor has made before, and use their involvement in incidents as a chance to seize an advantage.

There are many other plans for Incidents, ranging from my beloved Hanseatic League, to my less beloved Dutch revolters, and the interactions between Pope and Empire beyond the shadow kingdom. We'll look towards these in future Dev Diaries.

The President: Well it’s very nice of you to say that. I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine. We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time. Much more than the European countries are doing and they should be helping you more than they are. Germany does almost nothing for you. All they do is talk and I think it’s something that you should really ask them about. When I was speaking to Angela Merkel she talks Ukraine, but she doesn’t do anything. A lot of the European countries are the same way so I think it’s something you want to look at but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine. I wouldn’t say that it’s reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine.

(S/NF) President Zelenskyy: Yes you are absolutely right. Not only. 100%, but actually 1000% and I can tell you the following; I did talk to Angela Merkel and I did meet with her. I also met and talked with Macron and I told them that they are not doing quite as much as they need to be doing on the issues with the sanctions. They are not enforcing the sanctions. They are not working as much as they should work for Ukraine. It turns out that even though logically, the European Union should be our biggest partner but technically the United States is a much bigger partner than the European Union and I’m very grateful to you for that because the United States is doing quite a lot for Ukraine. Much more than the European Union especially when we are talking about sanctions against the Russian Federation. I would also like to thank you for your great support in the area of defense. We are ready to continue to cooperate for the next steps. specifically we are almost ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes.

(S/NF) The President: I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike... I guess you have one of your wealthy people... The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you’re surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.

(S/NF) President Zelenskyy: Yes it is very important for me and everything that you just mentioned earlier. For me as a President, it is very important and we are open for any future cooperation. We are ready to open a new page on cooperation in relations between the United States and Ukraine. For that. purpose, I just recalled our ambassador from United States and he will be replaced by a very competent and very experienced ambassador who will work hard on making sure that our two nations are getting closer. I would also like and hope to see him having your trust and your confidence and have personal relations with you so we can cooperate even more so. I will personally tell you that one of my assistants spoke with Mr. Giuliani just recently and we are hoping very much that Mr. Giuliani will be able to travel to Ukraine and we will meet once he comes to Ukraine. I just wanted to assure you once again that you have nobody but friends around us. I will make sure that I surround myself with the best and most experienced people. I also wanted to tell you that we are friends. We are great friends and you Mr. President have, friends in our country so we can continue our strategic partnership.

As a reminder, people thought the world would end when the first minimum wage came in, plus every increase since.  Yet it's sooooo bad that we have record employment.

As CAPX seems so concerned with putting the French economy, especially youth unemployment as the bar, I wonder if they have read [this article](https://www.independent.co.uk/infact/france-youth-unemployment-oecd-a7752816.html)

&gt;According to Eurostat, the French youth unemployment rate in 2016 was indeed 24.6 per cent, or around one in four. And this was around double the UK rate of 13 per cent.

&gt;But the EU statistics agency also reports that the French youth unemployment ratio in that year was just 9.1 per cent, not so dramatically different from the UK ratio of 7.6 per cent.

&gt;So, depending on which metric one uses, the French youth joblessness situation is either twice as bad as the UK’s, or roughly the same.

&gt;“One reason France looks worse on youth unemployment rates is that it has a much higher post-compulsory education participation rate than the UK, and that’s why the difference is much less when we compare the unemployment ratios than when we look at unemployment rates,” explains Nigel Meager, director of the Institute for Employment Studies.

&gt;This is borne out by 2016 OECD data on education participation rates. This finds that the number of French 18 year olds in tertiary education is 38 per cent, rising to 47 per cent for 20 year olds. For British 18 year olds the comparable figures are 21 per cent rising to 40 per cent for 20 year olds.

Then we have the costs:

&gt;Indeed, the Office for Budget Responsibility has already estimated (in October 2018) that ‘a rise in the NLW to two-thirds of median earnings would raise the unemployment rate by 0.4 percentage points in the ‘target’ year. In today’s terms that corresponds to a rise in unemployment of around 140,000, plus an equivalent reduction in hours for those remaining in employment. Average hours would be 0.4% lower and real GDP 0.2% lower than they otherwise would have been’.

The year after the target year is notably removed from the conversation.  Anyhoo, 140,000 jobs are nothing when spread across the UK.  The government didn't give a fuck about 160,000 jobs lost in the oil downturn in 2015-16 and those were high paid, high tax jobs that were geographically concentrated.

[],,yodatsracist,1353699705.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_9ouov,False,True,[],"Anabaptists are one of the main “streams” within what historians call the “[Radical Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_Reformation)”, as opposed to both the so-called “[Magisterial Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magisterial_Reformation)” of Luther, Calvin, &amp; Zwingli on the one hand and the [Counter-Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Reformation) (which many historians argue should really be seen as the “Catholic Reformation”) on the other. 

The Radical Reformation is a blanket term containing a range of groups rejecting secular authority over the Church entirely. Anabaptism (which emphasized a “believer’s baptism” rather than infant baptism) was the largest stream, but early Unitarians (Socinians, the Polish Brethren, Transylvanian Unitarians, etc) and other more obscure groups like the Schwenckfelders are also classed in the Radical Reformation (the historian who coined the term was himself a Unitarian, and I think it comes out of his trying to find a place for Unitarianism in the tapestry of Reformation Europe). 

The early Reformation was exceedingly chaotic (see, for instance, the Peasants’ War) in terms of what was and wasn’t allowed now, and there were those that went much further than the North German Princes and rich merchants in the Netherlands and Switzerland could abide. Münster was either a high water mark or a low point for the Radical tradition, and in the wake of it is actually where we see many of these groups adopt a strict pacifism.  Menno Simons (hence, Mennoninites) was particularly influential in one part of Germany (he had always rejected the Münsterites) but other groups, like the Hutterites, preached it in other places. This is not to say that there was violence before Münster and leave after, but that there was a group of people who thought Luther and Calvin didn’t go far enough and from the start some believed in radical peace (Conrad Grebel) and some believed in violent action. You can find, for example, Conrad Grebel and Thomas Müntzer pushing for each even in the 1520’s, before even the first Anabaptist statement of faith (I think). Some believed that the apocalypse as portrayed in Revelation may be at hand and violence was required and some believed that true Christians would always be persecuted by the World and that Christians should be “in the World, but not of it”.

The violent half didn’t fully die out at Münster, but they effectively did, with some tiny groups like the [Batenbergers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batenburgers) hanging on for a generation. However, after Münster, the debate was mostly settled, and the Anabaptist mainstream embraced a *very* strict pacifism, though secular authorities for the next two hundred or so years still treated them with suspicion at best. To be Mennonite, follow to Menno Simons, or to be Hütterite, to follow Jacob Hütter, was to reject Münster. Most Anabaptists had aligned with one or the other by the late 16th century, if I recall. The Amish split from the Mennonites in the late 17th century, as some groups followed Jacob Amman’s proposals for a stricter order of some things not related to pacifism (I guess Ammanish was too long). I think those are the three Anabaptist groups that can trace their roots all the way back to the time of Münster. Others, groups, including the ancestors to the Baptists dominant in the American South (which grew out of an English rather than German tradition), tended to discover the idea of the believer’s baptism on their own, rather than borrow it from Anabaptist theology.",True,False,False,,,0,1569921125,,False,0,{},f23f327,False,t3_dbkz9x,False,False,t1_f23c8by,/r/todayilearned/comments/dbkz9x/til_that_president_john_quincy_adams_took_the/f23f327/,False,,1578029172,17,True,[],False,todayilearned,t5_2qqjc,r/todayilearned,public,0,

Tirthanka Roy critiqued its argument in *How British Rule Changed India’s Economy: The Paradox of the Raj*, and wrote that there is little evidence that Churchill’s personal views about Indians influenced the policies of the War Cabinet. With Japan’s entry into the war and the fall of Singapore in February 1942, the British Empire’s resources were a critical asset for Britain to fight a war that stretched from Europe to North Africa to Asia. A potential obstacle to using this resource was the local nationalist movement.

Churchill’s reactionary views on the empire notwithstanding, the context for almost everything he said about Indians and the empire was related to the Indian nationalist movement. Negotiating with the Indian nationalists during the War could be pointless and dangerous because the moderate nationalists were demoralised by dissensions and the radical nationalists wanted the axis powers to win on the eastern front. Racist or not, no Prime Minister would be willing to fight a war and negotiate with the nationalists at the same time. What has any of that to do with the famine? Very little. The War Cabinet did not divert enough ships from the theatres of war to Bengal or order India to divert army rations to feeding people because the Cabinet believed what the Bengalis told it: there was no shortage of food in Bengal. The Cabinet took decisions in the knowledge that the Axis powers were sinking one ship every day and had sunk around a million tons of shipping in 1942. The regions where rice might be available were the most dangerous waters to enter. Army rations were already reduced. Further cuts could risk a mutiny.

The Bengal Famine of 1943 has never been explained. It offers no definite lesson. The culpability of either Nature, or Administration, or London, or Market has not been proven. In any case, and without meaning to make light of the enormous human tragedy of 1943, the so called Great Bengal Famine was not really that great a disruption to the trend in life expectancy in India, which had turned upward decades ago.

Tharoor, the Hindu nationalists' Useful Liberal, is comparably unreliable.

Boris Johnson is asking the European Union to rule out a further extension to Article 50 as part of a new Brexit deal, The Times has learnt.
The prime minister will publish a legal text spelling out his proposed alternative to the Irish backstop within days as negotiations with Brussels enter a crucial period. He has privately made clear that an agreement should include a commitment from the 27 other EU nations that they will not allow another Brexit delay.

Mr Johnson’s intention is to confront MPs in parliament with a binary choice of agreeing the revised deal or ensuring that Britain falls out of the EU without agreement at the end of the month. If he succeeds, the prime minister will, in effect, nullify the Benn Act, which compels him to seek an extension to Article 50.

“I’m cautiously optimistic. We have made some pretty big moves, we are waiting to see whether our European friends will help us and whether we can find the right landing zone,” Mr Johnson has said. “But whatever happens, we’ll come out on October 31.”

The architects of the law, including the former Tory MPs Sir Oliver Letwin and Dominic Grieve, have always acknowledged that it cannot compel other EU nations to grant another extension. The demand to rule out further delay could complicate an already fraught negotiation, however.

Senior ministers are bracing themselves for what one has described as a “moment of truth” for Dublin, Paris, Berlin and Brussels when Britain tables its text on proposals for the Irish border after Brexit. Some were expressing concern last night that the Republic of Ireland seemed to be cooling on the solution, which is thought to include limited checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from mainland Britain.

Speaking from the Conservative conference in Manchester, Mr Johnson shot down reports that the government is proposing customs checks away from the Irish border but refused to give details of his preferred solution.

The plans, contained in “non-paper” proposals sent to Brussels, would see so-called customs clearance centres between five and 10 miles away from the border, and immediately attracted criticism from the Irish government. Simon Coveney, Irish deputy prime minister, tweeted: “Non-Paper = Non-Starter. Time the EU had a serious proposal from the UK Govt if a #Brexit deal is to be achievable in October. NI and IRE deserves better!”

Mary Lou McDonald, the leader of Sinn Fein, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that the plans amounted to “the reimposition of a hard border” which “goes against all commitments made by the British government” at the start of negotiations.

Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said: “If Boris Johnson had spent any time listening to businesses and communities in Northern Ireland, he would know that these proposals are utterly unworkable.”
Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, said that the proposals showed that Mr Johnson was not serious about getting a deal. She called for MPs to take fresh steps to avert no-deal because “we cannot be confident the prime minister will obey the law”.

She claimed that the onus was now on Jeremy Corbyn to decide on a candidate he would support to lead an alternative government, which could induce the Lib Dems to back a no-confidence vote in the prime minister.
But the prime minister said it was “a needless distortion of what we’re proposing”.

He fuelled speculation that the UK could use its veto or ask the EU to deny an extension in order to ensure the UK leaves the union on October 31.
“I think it would be a mistake to keep the UK bound in beyond the time people want to come out,” he told the Today programme.

“It’s a matter of common observation that the UK wants to come out. I don’t think any purpose is served in corralling the UK inside the EU”.
If Brussels chooses to engage with the British proposals, ministers expect intense negotiations leading up to the European Council, which takes place in a little more than a fortnight. Should the EU agree to both a new deal and to rule out an extension, the parliamentary arithmetic will be radically altered.

Mr Johnson’s request will provoke a battle with Remain MPs for the ear of European leaders including Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and President Macron. If a deal can be secured, France in particular is likely to look sympathetically on Mr Johnson’s request. In March Mr Macron made a similar proposal that would have forced parliament to choose between the existing withdrawal agreement, no-deal and revoking Article 50. The plan was rejected by other EU leaders, which is now seen in Brussels as a mistake.

The prime minister has been warned by members of his cabinet that he will be forced to delay Brexit unless he can get a deal with the EU. One minister said that Mr Johnson was now facing a straight choice of “deal or delay” and could not leave without a deal on October 31. Another minister involved in “war-gaming” attempts to circumvent the act, which forces Mr Johnson to request a Brexit delay if he cannot strike a deal, conceded that they were unlikely to be successful. “The law is the law,” the minister said.

Ministers expect Mr Johnson to “take it to the max” to force Britain to leave the EU at the end of this month. The prime minister has told aides that he is prepared to give evidence in person at any Supreme Court hearing into the legality of the Benn Act, which he has called “the surrender act”.

Sajid Javid, the chancellor, has said that he knows how the prime minister intends to achieve an October 31 withdrawal, adding that it “can still be done” despite the legislation.
“Of course, every government should observe all laws at all times. We’re taking a careful look at that law,” he told the BBC. “The intention of the law is clear and I do think it has absolutely made it harder for the government to get the deal that we all want to see.”

James Cleverly, the Conservative Party chairman, also indicated that there may be a way of circumventing the Benn Act.
“Legislation passed in a rush tends to be bad legislation,” he said. “What we’ve seen is parties distorting the parliamentary process, breaking conventions, taking a very creative interpretation of parliamentary procedures to prevent the government discharging a promise the prime minister made and indeed a promise that all parties made at the referendum.”",True,False,False,,,0,1569924507,,False,0,{},f23h52u,True,t3_dbr6s4,True,False,t3_dbr6s4,/r/ukpolitics/comments/dbr6s4/block_brexit_delay_boris_johnson_urges_eu_prime/f23h52u/,False,,1578030144,9,True,[],False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,r/ukpolitics,public,0,

Tenho momentos de extremo ódio e de extremo amor comigo, sabe? E faz 1 mês que decidi entrar na academia, não apenas pra emagrecer mas pra me manter ativa de alguma forma. E venho trabalhando algumas coisas na minha mente, e queria passar pra vc tbm: 

1. Tente ao máximo não se comparar com os outros: são outras pessoas, outra genética, outro metabolismo... se comparar só faz a gente desanimar ainda mais com o nosso processo

2. Não espere resultados imediatos: sou ansiosa p caralho com resultados, quero vê-los logo... mas não adianta, emagrecer rápido em 1 mês não é saudável, e há chances de voltar tudo na mesma velocidade. Então, respira fundo e tenha consistência. Tente ir na academia todos os dias, ou caminhar ou nadar... se mantenha ativa

3. Se olhe no espelho e veja as partes do seu corpo que vc acha bonita, fofa: como falei antes, é uma relação de amor e ódio. O ideal é que a parte do amor seja mais alta que o ódio né? Então todo dia se olhe no espelho, se elogie mentalmente em algum aspecto. Se amar é difícil as vezes, mas não vamos deixar de tentar ❤️

4. Não se martirize pq comeu algo fora da “dieta” ou não foi pra academia um dia da semana... não deu pra ir? Comeu algo que tava com vontade? não há problema!!! Apenas volte pra sua rotina, não desista! Isso não significa que vc fracassou... ninguém mantém uma rotina perfeita, nem mesmo esses influencers aí. Se parabenize por se permitir tentar algo novo e fora da zona de conforto! Isso sim!

Com certeza tem outras coisas, mas pense no bem que faz atividade física, os resultados na balança chegam...  busque ajuda profissional, fazer terapia é outra forma de nutrir o interior. Que seja um processo pros dois: mente e corpo. Se for só o corpo, a mente tem muita dificuldade de acompanhar.

Je vois vraiment pas ce que j'ai dit qui est faux. J'ai pas voulu entrer dans les détails, vu que c'est pas tant ca dont OP parlait, donc j'ai survolé, mais ils ont abolis pas mal de privilèges, et bon, la répression de la révolte Satsuma, ca fait partie de l'élimination de cette classe, non ?

Au passage, en parlant du dernier Samurai, y'avait effectivement un étranger parmi eux, mais [il était Français et non Américain.](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Brunet) (Pas du tout le ""dernier"" samurai du tout par contre) 

&gt; La situation ne s'est résolu qu'avec les guerres en Chine et Russie où on les a envoyé à l'étranger. De manière assez ironique, les premières vélléités impérialiste du Japon (en 1873 contre la Corée) était défendu en disant que cela permettrait de se débarrasser des samouraïs de bas-étage dont on n'avait plus besoin.

Oui, même stratégie que en 1592.

&gt; Les nobles eux ont conservé leurs pouvoirs jusqu'à la fin de la seconde guerre mondiale (même si il a tendu à se réduire à partir de 1910 et de la première démocratisation du Japon): il contrôlait les Zaibatzui (le complexe militaro-industriel japonais) et avait une position prééminente sur les affaires politiques via le Genrou (ou conseil des anciens) et le parlement où la noblesse était prépondérante. Cela vaut tend pour la plupart des ex-daimyo que pour la noblesse historique (noblesse historique qui a profité de la restauration Meiji pour récupérer un peu de pouvoir soit dit en passant)

Bah, c'est les ""convertis"" dont je parlais, en fait. Et si je dis pas de connerie, ils sont en partie encore là. Leurs rangs et titres de noblesse ont été abolis après-guerre, mais pas leur propriété. (Tout ce que j'ai trouvé, c'est ca : ""The 1946 Constitution of Japan abolished the kazoku and ended the use of all titles of nobility or rank outside the immediate Imperial Family. Since the end of the war, many descendants of the kazoku families continue to occupy prominent roles in Japanese society and industry."" de [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazoku#Succession_and_numbers))

&gt; Les réformes ont pour le coup été globales: politique (constitution à la prussienne avec chambre haute puissante pour la noblesse), sociale (abolition de l'ancienne division des classes, fin des pensions pour les guerriers), financière (contrôle accru des capitaux, création d'une banque d'état), administrative (fin des daimyos et du gouvernement privé avec la mise en place du système des préfectures, même si les préfets étaient souvent les descendants des anciens daimyos). Le capitalisme était en effet dirigiste. Capitalisme à l'anglaise me paraît bizarre parce que déja à l'époque, l'Angleterre avait une industrie des services très puissante, ce qui n'était pas le cas du japon.

Bah, politique et économique donc, pas que l'éducation, et c'est pas juste l'Empereur qui a dit ""Lisez des livres, lol"" comme ce que dit OP.

Et si je dis ""capitalisme à l'Anglaise"", c'est plus dans les méthodes pour commencer, pas la part de services (surtout que les services se développent après l'industrie pure) et c'est aussi parce que le Royaume Uni a aussi toujours eu les Nobles impliqués dedans (parce que contrairement en France ils sont pas passés à la Guillotine) et qu'ils forment un socle relativement solides sur lequel se baser. Les Japonais à l'époque aussi s'inspiraient, très pragmatiquement, de ce qui marchait, et l’Angleterre était le meilleur modèle avec les Allemands qui venaient de battre les Français. Il faut pas oublier non plus que pendant que la France soutenait l'ancien shogun, les Anglais soutenaient l'Empereur et la restauration, ils ont ainsi gardé une certaine influence.

Tu combines un peu tout ca, et on voit pourquoi les Japonais se sont plus inspirés de l'Angleterre/Allemagne que la France, ou bien même les Etats Unis. 

Enfin, bref, au final, oui, y'a pas trop de raisons de dire ""à l'anglaise"", du capitalisme est du capitalisme, même si c'est fait avec de l'argent de Nobles au lieu de Bourgeois. Je pense que ca fait quand même une différence.

&gt; A cette époque, le Japon est la seule puissance non ""blanche"" (selon les critères de l'époque) à avoir ""réussi"" son industrialisation: la Chine s'est vautrée, la Corée s'est embourbée et n'en voulait pas vraiment, l'Amérique du Sud n'a rien réussi. Le niveau du Japon n'était certes pas celui de l'Angleterre, pionnière de l'industrialisation, ou des Etats-Unis, qui ont tellement de ressources qu'ils ne savent plus quoi en faire, mais avait un niveau unique pour la région (notamment d'un niveau similaire à la Russie dès les années 1890), et surtout était capable de traiter les matières premières d'Inde, Chine et Corée. Un parallèle intéressant est de dire qu'ils étaient dans une position similaire à la Chine des années 90: industrie low-cost, main d'oeuvre bon marché et destiné à l'export.

Enfin, la Chine qui se vautre, c'est plus un truc de longue haleine, après tout, la révolution industrielle aurait très bien pu arriver chez eux, technologiquement parlant. Question compliquée, et durant le 18ème, ils étaient colonisés aussi, tout comme l'Inde (qui l'était doublement par les Mughals et les Anglais), un problème que le Japan n'avait pas, donc ca explique en partie la différence. (Après, ils avaient pas réglés les problèmes de fond) 

L'Amérique du Sud avait trop de problème politiques, même si y'a quand même certains succès, je trouve, et pour ce qui est de la Corée, par contre, j'en sais rien. 

Au final, je comparais surtout le Japon aux autres puissances ayant réussi leur transition, et la, le Japon est dans le peloton. 

&gt; L'empire colonial japonais s'est dessiné sur deux principes somme toute issu de l'occident: Pan-asiatisme aka nous sommes le peuple ""jaune"" le plus développé et devons aidé nos frères en péril en les élevant (toute ressemblance avec le discourd d'un certain Rudyard Kipling ou Jules Ferry n'est qu'une coïncidence) et sentiment d'être menacé d'abord par les russes, puis par les anglais puis par les américains et de devoir se constituer un glacis défensif/une réserve de ressource (parce que niveau ressource, le Japon s'est bof)

Après, faut quand même faire une différence entre les trois. Le pan-asiatisme, c'est pas l'Impérialisme anglais qui est allé quand même pas mal loin dans la pseudo-science raciale, ni l'Universalisme français, qui était au final pas mal basé sur les idées révolutionnaire et la déclaration des droits de l'Homme. Le racisme/colonialisme Français était plutôt basé sur l'idée de peuple, et de culture, tandis que les Anglais, c'était plus vraiment la race qui faisait toute la différence. Par exemple, y'a cette [caricature Allemande](https://i.redd.it/zix1w9d3ayi21.jpg) qui montre un peu ca, mais aussi on a pas voter non sur [la proposition du Japon sur l'égalité justement](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principe_de_l%27%C3%A9galit%C3%A9_des_races) a été rejeté par Wilson/les USA et ca a justement poussé le racisme Japonais à se renforcer.

Pendant ce temps, le racisme Japonais est basé dans leurs idée de peuple descendant de Yamato, ce qui est mystique/religieux, et pas tant basé que ca sur le développement économique et technologique ? Ou du moins, de ce que j'ai vu, la technologie a joué un facteur, mais pas tant que ca, ils ont pas nié l'Histoire que y'avait avant, par ex, quand la Chine dominait pas mal, par exemple. 

Je trouve ca un peu ironique de parler de ""Pan-asiatisme"" pour ceux qu'on fait les Japonais, parce que dès la Seconde Guerre mondiale, c'était plus du tout ca du tout. (Après, comme toute les formes d'impéralisme où on dit que c'est pour le bien du colonisé)

&gt; Le Japon des années 30 est très différent du Japon de 1870/1900. Meiji est mort en 1912, en pleine vague de démocratisation du Japon. Imputer à lui la montée du nationalisme et de l'emprise des militaires sur le Japon est exagéré.

Bah, justement, je disais qu'il avait pas tant de pouvoir que ca dans mon commentaire. Après, c'est ma faute, j'aurais peut être du le traduire en français au lieu de faire un copié/collé.

Indeed, over the six years of the war, Britain endured solitude for a matter of hours: on the same day Britain declared war both Australia and New Zealand issued their own declarations. Three days later South Africa entered the conflict and, the day after that, Canada.

&gt; By 1945 Britain had been joined in supposed solitude not just by the forces of the old “white” dominions, but by 2.25 million Indian soldiers (the largest volunteer army on earth) and a third of a million African servicemen. Almost 7,000 men from the Caribbean had joined the RAF and thousands of seamen from across the empire had served in the merchant navy. The empire sent money as well as men. Canada spent $1.6bn churning out RAF pilots and navigators, and the citizens of the distant Nigerian city of Kano, on the southern fringes of the African Sahel, raised £10,290. That money was sent to the British Treasury to purchase a Spitfire.

&gt; Just as Churchill is arguably more popular in the Britain of 2019 than he was in 1945, the empire’s contribution was better understood during the conflict. In 1943, the U&amp;Daily Express complained, ‘‘We frequently say that in the Battle of Britain we stood alone. But we were never just these little islands entirely by themselves. Canadian troops were among us. Australian troops were here. From all parts of the Empire aid flowed to us in men and goods.”

&gt; [...]

&gt; The Eighth Army, the force shipped to north Africa to defend a key supply route – **the Suez canal** – from the Italians and the German Afrika Korps, was, in fact, one of the most diverse armies ever assembled. By 1941, the year of the siege of Tobruk, **only a quarter of the troops of the British Eighth Army were British**. As the historian Ashley Jackson has pointed out, the rest came from India, Sri Lanka, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Southern Rhodesia, Uganda, Tanganyika, the Gold Coast, Kenya, Nigeria, Bechuanaland, the Gambia, Sierra Leone, Swaziland, Palestine, Mauritius, the Seychelles and Cyprus.

&gt; Polish pilots of 303 Squadron had the best record of any in the Battle of Britain, now dramatised in the film Hurricane. Polish paratroopers fought in the Arnhem offensive, though denied the opportunity to drop in Poland and support the Polish Home Army, as originally planned. The Polish Home Army was the largest organised wartime resistance in continental Europe, numbering some 400,000 personnel.

* has different qualities from the model advertised or shown to the client

* is not fit for purpose - either its standard purpose or a specific purpose ordered by the customer which you accepted

* doesn't show the quality and performance normal in products of the same type

* wasn't installed correctly - either by you, or by the customer, due to shortcomings in the instructions

2. Traditional clothing: the kilt; it's a historical mish-mash, the modern kilt isn't really the actual kilt of history, and it must be stressed that it's only really worn on special occasions (weddings, ceilidhs etc). Traditional food is haggis, oat based dishes, some seafood. I personally am fondest of Lorne sausage (a flat sliced sausage traditionally fried and eaten in a bread roll as a morning ""restorative""). Traditional drink is whisky, an excellent spirit with a world-famous reputation, and IRN BRU, a jealously guarded secret potion which grants Scottish people strength, vigour and the occasional superpower.
3. Scotland has a history of innovation dating to the Scottish Enlightenment, part of the wider European Enlightenment.

3. Currently we have no geo political adversaries or aggressors. You talk about joining this EU army for common defence, defence against who? we have no enemies because we are neutral. the moment we join an EU army that is gone.
4. You talk about the unreliablity of the Americans and NATO. can you actually show any evidence of this. NATO has ensured firstly that the cold war didnt go hot. Not only that but in the 70 years of its existence it has ensured global peace and not a single member nation has been attacked.
5. The EU army is a globalist project determined to strip away the idea of national sovereignty. First we strip away our sovereignty in order to give control of our tax policy to europe and now you want to give the last vestige of a nation state which is control of our own defence.

I do think some of the authors assumptions inflated it (see below). No doubt that transfusions are amazing and save huge numbers of people but they estimated 1 life saved per 2.7 units which seems a very low amount per life. In my experience (I’m a doctor) most transfusions don’t save lives but rather  improve recovery or quality of life. Some definitely do save lives (eg trauma or surgical haemorrhage) of course but most are given outside of such a dire life or death situation. Some individuals receive dozens and dozens of units over their lives (which would only count as one life saved unless you consider their lives to be counted as saved multiple times). Of course donated blood saved lives in other ways but this was not the work of our scientist or the calculation of the author. 

Anyhow, hate to be a dick about it because they made a massive contribution but it still has got to be an inflated figure. 

From the website:

“Every source quoted an amazing number of transfusions and potential lives saved in countries and regions worldwide. High impact years began around 1955 and calculations are loosely based on 1 life saved per 2.7 units of blood transfused. In the USA alone an estimated 4.5 million lives are saved each year. From these data I determined that 1.5% of the population was saved annually by blood transfusions and I applied this percentage on population data from 1950-2008 for North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and parts of Asia and Africa. This rate may inflate the effectiveness of transfusions in the early decades but excludes the developing world entirely.”",True,False,False,,,0,1569930071,,False,0,{},f23lfkp,False,t3_dbnsig,False,True,t1_f23jwce,/r/interestingasfuck/comments/dbnsig/this_man_is_a_hero/f23lfkp/,False,,1578032181,1,True,[],False,interestingasfuck,t5_2qhsa,r/interestingasfuck,public,0,

It's complicated.

In Lincoln's first inaugural address, he threatened the south with military action if they continued to resist paying the tariffs that protected Northern manufacturing from English and European competition.  During the war, he made multiple offers to the south to let them keep slavery in perpetuity, immune even from future constitutional amendments, if they would surrender and pay the tariffs.  

Tariffs collected in southern ports made up the lion's share of federal revenues at the time.  It's interesting that there's language in the confederate constitution that forbids the confederate government from using taxes collected in one state to build improvements (like roads and canals) in another.   From the southern point of view, the North was disproportionately taxing the south for the benefit of the north.

For the first two years of the war, slaves fleeing across union lines weren't free, they were captured and held as ""contraband of war"".  The federal government used slave labor during this period to build the Capitol, among other things.

Lincoln eventually came up with the Emancipation Proclamation, which only applied to slaves in areas not under Union control, and this was primarily a bit of political theater intended to keep England from intervening on the side of the south to reopen the southern ports for the cotton trade.

Once the war was over, the congress eventually amended the constitution to forbid slavery unless it was a punishment for a crime.  In practice, southern states were able to keep a lot of people working on chain gangs well into the 20th century.  Sharecropping also kept many people, black and white, in a condition of debt bondage that was functionally equivalent to slavery, except that landowners couldn't buy and sell sharecroppers and force them to change locations.",True,False,False,,,0,1569931572,,1569932324,0,{},f23mvis,False,t3_dbjqct,False,True,t1_f23ce0r,/r/technology/comments/dbjqct/twitter_is_ok_with_a_protrump_militias_tweets/f23mvis/,False,,1578032865,0,True,[],False,technology,t5_2qh16,r/technology,public,0,

To your first point though, I'm referring to the president of the EU council, currently Donald Tusk and obviously the highest position of the EU, the president of the EU commission, recently appointed Ursula Von Der Leyen. Since the amendments made in the Lisbon treaty, the EU parliament has virtual no say in these appointments and they happen behind closed doors.

And to your second point, I'll admit that's fair enough.... ish. Voting powers were kept to the elite until around 1885 when the government was held captive by a possible revolution and therefore decided to expand the electorate, so I think they held the government to account very well beside the technology available (worth noting that universal suffrage didn't happen till 1918, when women over 30 could vote, so not completely universal, but a huge difference). Having said that, I still think there is an argument to be made that holding more localised government accountable is easier than a centralised government positioned abroad. The only reason back then that they could pressure the government for reform is because they could hold there local lords and MPs to account so they can make meaningful intervention on their behalf in London, the electorate themselves weren't all traveling to London.

If we put pressure on an MEP to make change, they can't do nothing except from just bringing it up in conversation. It can easily be swatted down by the commission.

The Scottish Enlightenment (Scots: Scots Enlichtenment, Scottish Gaelic: Soillseachadh na h-Alba) was the period in 18th- and early-19th-century Scotland characterised by an outpouring of intellectual and scientific accomplishments. By the eighteenth century, Scotland had a network of parish schools in the Lowlands and four universities. The Enlightenment culture was based on close readings of new books, and intense discussions took place daily at such intellectual gathering places in Edinburgh as The Select Society and, later, The Poker Club, as well as within Scotland's ancient universities (St Andrews, Aberdeen, Glasgow, and Edinburgh).Sharing the humanist and rationalist outlook of the European Enlightenment of the same time period, the thinkers of the Scottish Enlightenment asserted the importance of human reason combined with a rejection of any authority that could not be justified by reason. In Scotland, the Enlightenment was characterised by a thoroughgoing empiricism and practicality where the chief values were improvement, virtue, and practical benefit for the individual and society as a whole.

&gt;
&gt;I'm 26 now but when I was a young lad(10ish) I, along with my younger brother(6ish) and younger sister(4ish) were taken to Disney land Florida by my dad and his wife. Before making the once in a lifetime journey from England, my dad did a little research about the attractions and rides. As It happened I was just over 1 inch (2.5cm for mainland Europeans) too short for the bigger and better rides, this being a once in childhood type of trip, my dad and I agreed I should try to make the most of it and somehow ride the best rides. 
&gt;
&gt;A few days after realising I was too short, which was pretty upsetting to 10YO me, my dad called me up to his home office. He had the tape measure and some jenga blocks in his hands. I grabbed my shoes, put a few blocks in each and measured myself. I was over the height restriction for the good.rides, I was over the moon. When we packed our suitcases for the flight from Manchester, England to Florida I made sure to add a good 20 jenga blocks to my suitcase. 
&gt;
&gt;First day in the magic kingdom I wanted to ride, if i remember correctly, was the Indiana Jones roller coaster, my dad and I went to the toilet/restroom just before the roller coaster and added a few blocks to each shoe. A slight hiccough un the mastermind plan, revealed itself as I limped out of the restroom. I hadn't tried to walk on top of these jenga blocks back in England, I just stood on them, at best they made me look like I had shit myself and at worst made me look like I had a pjycical disability. 
&gt;
&gt;We already had fast passes to the rides so as we were walking up the fast pass queue, a member of staff noticed my limp and asked me kindly if I wanted to go right to the front. A green, wet behind the ears 10YO me of course agreed and went straight to the front. I passed the height test and enjoyed the ride. This happened a few more times at other rides and parks...
&gt;
&gt;It was only a few years later I realised they only let me to the front of the queue because they thought i had a disability, my dad must have known but still allowed it. Regardless It was an amazing holiday/vacation, best 2 weeks of my young child life.
&gt;
&gt;Tl:Dr dad put jenga blocks in my shoes to make me taller for the good.rides at Disney world. The blocks also made me limp and Disney employees took me to the front of the queue more than once believing I had a physical disability.

**UK + EU Mostly**

**21+**

We are well and truly on board the Destiny hype train due to the arrival of shadowkeep, our little clan has been ticking away over the quieter months but is looking to get some more bodies involved. We're down for anything...

We are a new clan called Going Orbs Deep (lols) founded by a group of people who had been around a fair bit and realised they wanted a much more laid back environment to chat and play in.

Our Clan isn’t your typical clan, and we have very few rules we would ask you to follow, as long as you’re up for a laugh, not easily offended, enjoy a bit of drunk destiny or simply chatting nonsense you probably should come and say hi and join our discord and get a feel of what our little group is like.

As well as banter we’re players with a mix of sweatiness. If week one raid clears are your thing, or you're purely here for PVP glory you’re gonna find people in our clan that are in that mindset. But if you’re a casual destiny player and you’re most likely to be more active during new events that’s fine, we get it, life gets in the way sometimes. Whether you’re a new player or been around since D1 you’re more than welcome.

We’re all based in the UK and i ask you’re over 21 and not too sensitive as some of our chat really isn’t that PC sometimes and it’s definitely not child-friendly. All we ask is you're not easily offended, can take a laugh and like to get involved.

Impossible de savoir à ce stade si cet atelier C2 a joué un rôle particulier dans l’incendie de l’usine Lubrizol. Mais ce qui est certain, c’est qu’il a fait l’objet d’un passe-droit administratif concernant un produit dangereux.

Début 2019, la préfecture de Seine-Maritime a autorisé Lubrizol à augmenter de 1 598 tonnes la capacité de stockage de produits – non spécifié – « très inflammables ». Or, à partir de mille tonnes, une procédure spécifique de demande d’autorisation est obligatoire. Elle n’a pas eu lieu. Il n’y a pas eu d’étude de danger ni d’impact à ce sujet.

Dans ses rapports de 2016, les appréciations de l’inspecteur des installations sont globalement favorables à l’exploitant. À plusieurs reprises, l’auteur écrit que « les principaux risques mis en évidence dans l’accidentologie interne et externe au site ont été pris en compte par la société Lubrizol dans son analyse des risques ». Et que « la méthodologie utilisée par l’exploitant pour la réalisation de son évaluation préliminaire des risques est jugée acceptable ».

Mais il formule plusieurs demandes de renforcement de la maîtrise des risques : la pérennisation de la surveillance des rejets de plusieurs substances – nonylphénols, zinc et ses composés, di(2-ethylhexyl)phtalate – dans la Seine, notamment.

L’inspecteur signale qu’un dépassement de seuil et une concentration dix fois supérieure à la norme de qualité environnementale ont été mesurés, pour les deux premiers produits. Et qu’une concentration dix fois supérieure à la norme de qualité environnementale a été détectée pour le dernier. Il souhaite aussi ajouter de nouvelles prescriptions concernant l’étude de danger des installations fabriquant 20 000 tonnes d’anhydride polyoléfinique et 25 000 tonnes de dispersants d’hydrocarbures (le PIBSA) par an.

D’autres mesures de maîtrise du risque sont annoncées comme étant à venir : un mécanisme de sécurité pour les températures hautes en lien avec une alarme visuelle et sonore, ainsi qu’un détecteur de sulfure d’hydrogène (H2S). Mais aussi une détection incendie automatique avec mise en œuvre de moyens manuels au niveau d’un poste de déchargement de stockage (à l’ouest de l’usine), des barrières de prévention du risque de débordement de bacs, l’asservissement des pompes de transfert à des alarmes de niveau dans les bacs de stockage d’huile. Et encore, la mise en œuvre de dispositifs permettant de confiner les eaux d’extinction générées par un incendie dans un bâtiment (le G).

Ont-elles été mises en œuvre depuis ? Sollicitée, la préfecture ne nous a pas répondu. Les mêmes questions adressées à la responsable de la communication du groupe, aux États-Unis, sont restées sans réponse.

Cinq jours après le début de l’incendie, la nature, la quantité et l’emplacement des produits qui se trouvaient dans l’usine ne sont toujours pas publics. La préfecture de Seine-Maritime distille les informations au compte-gouttes. Une conférence de presse doit se tenir mardi soir.

Les questions des riverain·e·s à ce sujet restent sans réponse. Comment l’expliquer ? Les associations de protection de l’environnement qui siègent dans les instances créées au fil des ans pour obliger les industriels à plus de transparence en connaissent la réponse : depuis 2017, une réglementation bloque la diffusion hors des usines sensibles d’informations précises sur les substances qui s’y trouvent.

Après les attentats de Paris et de Saint-Denis de 2015, les consignes de sécurité ont été renforcées et requièrent désormais l’opacité pour éviter les attaques de sites chimiques, potentiellement très polluantes.

« Auparavant, toutes ces informations étaient accessibles, explique Claude Barbay, aujourd’hui membre de la Commission de suivi de site (CSS) pour France Nature Environnement (FNE). Brutalement, ils ont tout fermé en 2017, suite à la parution d’une circulaire scélérate de transparence “opaque”. On en revient à la situation de non-information qui existait avant l’accident d’AZF à Toulouse, en 2001. On ne peut pas l’imputer aux industriels locaux. »

Il réclame aujourd’hui la réunion d’une CSS extraordinaire sur l’incendie, ses causes et ses conséquences. Mais il regrette l’esprit de « boîte fermée sur elle-même, paternaliste » de Lubrizol, une entreprise où le seul syndicat actif est une organisation maison. « Nez » formé à la détection des odeurs des usines, il regrette aussi « l’esprit de boutique » de Lubrizol, qui « a toujours l’impression qu’on cherche à lui nuire » quand on lui pose des questions.

Membre du Conseil de l’environnement et des risques sanitaires et technologiques (CODERST), une commission consultative départementale, pour FNE, Guillaume Blavette dénonce aussi la perte des informations transmises aux riverain·e·s : « Il ne peut y avoir aucun débat en Coderst, on ne peut pas poser de questions, les exploitants ne sont pas convoqués, on ne peut rien faire. »

Conséquence : « La protection en dernier recours de la santé publique et de l’environnement ne repose plus tant sur l’État que sur la bonne volonté des exploitants. » Il y voit l’une des causes de la grande défiance des habitant·e·s de Rouen vis-à-vis de l’État : « Tout découle de la faute de sincérité des messages publics. Quand on instaure un vrai dialogue avec les riverains, s’il se produit un accident, il y a moins de défiance. »

L’usine de Lubrizol à Rouen fait l’objet d’un traitement particulier, du fait de la dangerosité des produits qui s’y trouvent. Depuis 2014 elle dispose à ce titre d’un plan de prévention des risques technologiques (PPRT) spécifique. Pourtant elle n’a pas renouvelé son étude de danger.

Ce document, central pour l’analyse des risques d’un site industriel, remonte à 2009. En vertu des obligations pesant sur les sites Seveso seuil haut, il aurait dû être revu en 2014 puis cinq ans plus tard. À notre connaissance, ce réexamen n’a toujours pas eu lieu en septembre 2019.

The declaration to leave on 31 October can’t be made effective by the Government unless Parliament has voted for a treaty or voted to accept exit by default.  The Court has said, in as stark a language as in the history of court rulings, that this requires Parliament to agree to proceed.  Boris might not listen. But based on how they most recently ruled, it points to the Court telling Boris, telling Parliament, telling the Queen, and telling Europe “That never happened!” and just erasing A50 from British legal memory.  As a matter of domestic constitutional law, Europe will record that Britain never made a declaration under A50, and the UK will remain a member.

The PM can’t default on the requirements of Benn, and if he does, the Court will most likely undo Brexit in its entirety, resetting the entire thing to a “blank page,” because they’ve accepted that Brexit can’t occur without further direction from Parliament. If Boris attempts to ignore it, he’ll be at the sharp end of a judicial savaging that makes the recent ruling look like a friendly hello. 

If Boris wants to preclude that, he’d be smart to lay a motion before the house *repealing* Brexit, and the date, and then dare the House to pass it.  He can vote against it. And if the House does too, he can rightly claim that they’ve considered the matter and directed the Government to proceed as a matter of law. If they don’t bend on the date, and they don’t pass anything, but there’s clear evidence that they still want it to proceed, he insulates himself from a retroactive dismissal of A50, and he probably makes the case for prerogative discretion in making it happen.

How exactly is it a myth? Unadjusted, women are paid 78% of the average male salary. Adjusted, women are paid anywhere from 80 to 98% of male salary, depending on the field. Neither is 100, so there is a pay gap. Saying there isn't, is factually wrong.

&gt; Eric Prydz is a Swedish DJ and producer best known for his 2004 hit single ""Call On Me"", his remix of Pink Floyd's ""Another Brick In The Wall"" (known as ""Proper Education"") and more recently the anthem ""Pjanoo"". 

&gt; He also releases music under the aliases of Cirez D, Pryda and Sheridan. Prydz produces electronic music which falls into a variety of sub genres, most notably house (Including electro house and tech house), minimal and techno.

&gt; Aside from producing music Prydz also runs the record labels Pryda, Pryda Friends, and Mouseville, which release most of his own music.

&gt; He has enjoyed great chart success with the singles ""Proper Education"" and ""Call on Me"", the latter sampling the chorus of Valerie (the only sample ever allowed of Winwood's work), which topped the UK singles charts for 5 weeks. ""Proper Education"" reached number 2, 4 and 12 in the UK, German and Swedish charts respectively.

&gt; Although it is reported that Eric Prydz has a fear a flying, he does not let that stop him from playing in places such as New York, as well as various countries in Europe.

Ah yes, how could I have forgotten this bullet proof piece of pure reason and logic? *I'm not wrong.*

&gt; Antifa acts in violence and wants to control what other people do and think.

Correct, this is not unique to antifa. The US government uses violence to control people too, it's called the police, military, and prison. All forms of governmental ideology accept systemic violence as necessary except for anarchy. Every political faction in all of time and history would love to ""control"" what people think, fortunately this is impossible (at least with current tech).

&gt; This is a very fascist train of thought.

No it isn't. This is being done by protestors and not the government. Anti-fascists would say if a government were to take the actions they are taking that would be bad. This is not an area of dissonance, this is a necessary ideological distinction.

&gt; The definition of fascist on Merriam Webster is ""A tendency toward or actual exercise of strong autocratic or dictatorial control"".

How exactly are these protestors exercising their autocratic and dictatorial control? Violence is not the same thing as dictatorship? Obviously?

&gt; they seem quite violent towards a innoncent many who has done nothing wrong.

Again violence isn't unique to fascism, obviously. I'm not saying violence is good, but it isn't fascism.

&gt; Communism is very similar to fascism basically the same thing.

Again you're not actually making an argument here. ""These things are similar because they are similar."" As every legitimate source will tell you, they are not the same thing. [Read the Wikipedia.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism)

&gt; Simply the left wing equivalent of fascism.

Fascism is *explicitly right wing*.

&gt; Communism is very much a governmental ideology, the economic part of communism is socialism.

This is wrong because [socialism and communism are, in fact, separate things](http://www.businessdictionary.com/article/1030/communism-vs-socialism-d1412/).

&gt; You wouldnt be able to find much difference between a communist society and a fascist society, many of the words you use to describe a fascist society could also be used to describe a communist one

Again incorrect. An actual communist or socialst society would have relative wealth equality among all it's citizens. Can you give an example where this is the case? Nazi Germany? Russia? China? North Korea? No, all of these fascist governments had very little wealth equality so they aren't communist or socialst. (And I swear if someone comments ""but National Socialist Party"" I'm going to loose my mind.) You seem to have some misconceptions about socialism and communism so I'd recommend you watch [this video explaining some of the history and application](https://youtu.be/k79wCaFgU40).

&gt; Authoritarian ultranationalism characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, and strong regimentation of society and of the economy which came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe. 

So, nothing about communism or socialism necessitates a dictatorship. In fact the modern progressive left in America advocates most commonly for ""Democratic Socialism"" which explicitly *does not have* a dictator. Though, I'm a little confused about why we're even talking about socialism and communism because I thought this was about antifa? Do you not have any valid criticism of their ideology besides they're violent and some of them like communism or socialism?

    Bonjour,
    
    Je sors donc d'un ban de 24h pour avoir défendu un posteur qui venait de voir son message retiré et son compte banni temporairement.
    
    En effet, la modération a jugé que le posteur en question faisait un post humoristique low effort et l'a donc retiré pour cette raison, alors que j'estime que son post était tout à fait sérieux. Lorsqu'il a contesté cette décision et attiré l'attention du FL sur son message original, la modération a retiré la contestation et banni l'utilisateur temporairement.
    
    J'ai fait remarquer que je jugeais que ce n'était pas correct et j'ai été banni 24h avec pour justification ""va contester ailleurs"".
    
    J'ai demandé en modmail quelle est la règle de /r/france que j'aurais violé et qui justifie mon ban et, n'ayant pas reçu de réponse qui me satisfait, je me permets de la poser ici.

And yet you peg capitalism with slavery and anti-women? Which country exactly? You're a special ignorant fellow.. 

&gt; I love how you started complaining about dressing up work or die ethic as ""voluntary"" 

I didn't.. it was the first think I said about slavery in communism..

It doesn't.. It literally has nothing to do with it.. 

&gt; Because capitalists will never stop fetishizing ""free choice"" and ""voluntarism""

""Free choice"" is a democracy thing but democracy can't be made in another economic system right now.. Socialism is out of the question.. And yes, ""free choice"" is important.. 

""Volutarism"" I've used to describe forced labour under the communistic system.. It the way they made it appear ok to the general population and even the people doing the work (that you had to do, no ifs and buts).. The meaning in a democracy is different.. 

&gt; will never recognize social problems 

And yet the countries with the most social programs which recognizes the most problems are capitalistic.. But even on this point, the type of economy is not related to the problem.. 

&gt;It's fucking easier for capitalists to blame working class and poor either for being lazy, dumb or blame race or gender than admit that their system doesn't offer freedom for everyone at all and many will be forever bound to their social conditions until they die.

1. Doubling Obama's federal deficit from $550 billion to $1.1 trillion
2. Cheating on his pregnant wife with a pornstar, then lying about the hush money while President
3. Discrediting the FBI, CIA, and NSA as part of a ""deep state"" conspiracy
4. Disregarding American intelligence services in favor of statements made by Russia

6. Starting trade wars with Europe, North America, and China simultaneously
7. Implementing price controls on the pharmaceutical industry
8. Supporting use of eminent domain
9. Insulting John McCain for being a POW while being a draft dodger

1. Cutting taxes (although it was the wealthiest in red states that benefited the most by far)
2. Appointing pro-gun and anti-abortion judges

4. Deregulation of the environment, banking, and net neutrality
4. Trying to start building a wall
5. Kicking off ICE raids that brought in 35 illegal immigrants
6. Opposing action on climate change
7. Supporting new oil pipelines

Here is my Citizen Eco-Drive Chrono-Time A-T Mens Watch BY0000. It is a feature packed watch that I’ve had for a while but I’m afraid as I delve down deeper into the world of watches my tastes have changed and Im saving up for the SARB035, and this does not get any more wrist time. Citizen's first Ecodrive radio controlled analogue world timer watch. The Chrono-Time AT features radio controlled accuracy in USA, Europe, Japan and China - so the time is always correct. Features world time in 26 cities and UTC, Alarm, chronograph, perpetual calendar, rotating inner bezel ring, power reserve indicator and is watch resistant to 200 metres.


There are many scratches, as I used this watch for years and I have tried my very best to photograph them.  I have a picture in the album where I highlighted over most the defects in the glass because they were pretty hard to photograph and I don’t want to mislead anyone into thinking otherwise. A good polish and a new crystal and this baby is set.

This is kind of a hard watch to get a lot of info on because it is discontinued. Here are some links to help if you want to learn more about the watch:


https://www.abt.com/product/44346/Citizen-Eco-Drive-Chrono-Time-A-T-Mens-Watch-BY000056E.html

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muDvZkgKMF0


The strap is brand new. The watch itself runs perfect. One of the images shows in the album shows the current battery life. It is kind of a hassle to set it if you can’t sync up to a radio tower which I can’t currently. That’s why the time is set but not the date. 

* Case width approx.: 45mm


* Band width: 24mm


This watch “retailed” at around $600 dollars but from my research can tell for the most part sold around $450 dollars..

I am asking for ~~$300 $275~~ **$225** shipped OBO. Paypal G+S or Venmo, CONUS only please. Any questions feel free to message me and I will answer as best as I can.

The clearest cut case of ""yeah that's probably a bad thing"" is English imperialism over languages in India, where it made the most significant dent thanks to the UK, and English colonialism over native languages in Canada and the US, neither of which can be blamed on the UK (who were far more pro-Native than either of their settled colonies). 

In either case, though, it is the strength of the economic system of capitalism and global trade, pioneered by Britain and expanded upon by the US, that has made English an actually dominant language.

O rosto dela foi riscado com a frase ""Lula tá preso babaca"". A prefeitura afirmou que a arte será apagada.

 A imagem da jovem foi feita pelo artista acreano Matias Souza durante um evento de grafite na cidade mato-grossense. A ação tinha o objetivo de revitalizar o viaduto São Cristóvão. O artista diz ter levado menos de 24 horas, entre a última sexta-feira (27) e o sábado (28), para concluir a ilustração. A obra apareceu pichada apenas três dias depois.

 Greta Thunberg começou a fazer greves pelo clima em agosto do ano passado, e desde então [reuniu milhares de jovens pelo mundo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2019/02/adolescente-provoca-greves-pelo-mundo-as-sextas-feiras-pelo-clima.shtml) na mesma causa e [discursou na cúpula do ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2019/09/voces-roubaram-minha-infancia-como-ousam-diz-greta-na-onu.shtml)[clima da ONU](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2019/09/voces-roubaram-minha-infancia-como-ousam-diz-greta-na-onu.shtml). 

  Souza afirmou que decidiu pintar a ativista porque queria provocar uma reflexão. ""Como a Greta virou um rosto conhecido, quem visse o painel ligaria a imagem a questões ambientais"", disse Souza.

 Outra ilustração que também foi criticada na cidade é a do [cacique Raoni ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/09/raoni-diz-que-bolsonaro-nao-tem-coracao-bom-e-quer-destruir-indigenas.shtml)[Metuktire](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/09/raoni-diz-que-bolsonaro-nao-tem-coracao-bom-e-quer-destruir-indigenas.shtml), feita pelo grafiteiro amazonense Raiz Campos. Raoni é considerado uma das maiores lideranças indígenas no país e [se tornou alvo de críticas do presidente Jair ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/09/para-bolsonaro-raoni-foi-cooptado-por-autoridades-estrangeiras.shtml)[Bolsonaro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/09/para-bolsonaro-raoni-foi-cooptado-por-autoridades-estrangeiras.shtml) recentemente.

 ""Mato Grosso tem a região do Xingu e já viu muitos massacres e chacinas contra indígenas. Decidi pintar um representante da luta da região que dedicou sua vida à proteção dos povos nativos e do meio ambiente”, diz o artista.

 As ilustrações desagradaram representantes do agronegócio da região. Durante sessão na Câmara de Sinop na tarde de segunda-feira (30), parlamentares criticaram as duas ilustrações. O vereador Hedvaldo Costa (PR) afirmou que as os grafites eram uma tentativa de os artistas classificarem os produtores rurais da região como “destruidores dos índios e da natureza”.

 “Aqui é uma região de agronegócio, de pessoas que não destroem. Quem faz o agro está cumprindo a lei”, disse Costa. Segundo ele, os agricultores da região têm responsabilidade ambiental. “Quiseram trazer suas ideologias para o patrimônio público de Sinop, ofendendo a administração da cidade”, afirmou o parlamentar, que foi apoiado por alguns dos colegas.

 O diretor de Cultura de Sinop, Daniel Coutinho, relatou que a imagem da ativista sueca será apagada na manhã desta quarta-feira (2). “Eu me reuni com os organizadores do evento em Sinop e decidimos que a imagem dela será substituída por uma arara ou uma matrinxã, que é um peixe típico da região”.

 Em relação ao grafite de Raoni, ele diz que ainda não há definição se a imagem será apagada. “Se os organizadores do evento entenderem que é melhor apagá-lo também, poderão fazer isso, mas o principal objetivo é apagarmos o da Greta.""

 Coutinho afirma que as imagens da adolescente e do cacique fugiram da proposta da intervenção. “O objetivo era reproduzir a fauna e a flora da região, não ilustrar pessoas”, diz.

 Ele nega que a exclusão da imagem da ativista seja uma censura. “É até mesmo uma forma de evitar novos atos de vandalismo, como as pichações que fizeram durante a madrugada.""

 Souza discorda e diz ter sido censurado. “Nenhum artista fica feliz em ter sua arte apagada, mas eu entendo que o Brasil vive um momento delicado em que os ânimos estão aflorados. Só me resta respeitar a decisão, embora eu discorde da atitude.""

 “Já estamos acostumados com os grafites apagados.

M-am mutata in bloc nou acum trei ani si am avut ceva batai de cap pana sa fac tranzitia. Am avut nevoie de multa rabdare pana am gasit ceva care sa ne multumeasca. 

Mai jos pasii urmati de noi:

- vizionari in draci cu temele facute. Le puneam toate interebarile la care ma puteam gandi, atat reprezentantilor constructorului cat si agentilor imobiliari. Intreberi de genul - pentru ce regim de inaltime are autorizatia? Pot-ul este respectat? Carte tehnica exista? Materiale folosite - instalatie electrica, sanitara, izolatie, etc.
- dupa multe vizionari, am facut un contract de rezervare pe 1000E, redactat de avocatul meu sau mai bine spus, corectat ce aveau ei ca model
- am avut noroc ca taicamiu e instalator old school care a trecut prin mai multe etape tehnologice si mereu s-a pus la curent cu tot ce este nou in domeniu. L-am luat la o inspectie si pe urma a stat pe capul lor ce sa repare, cum, unde, etc.
- am luat prin credit ipotecar si am vorbit la banca sa ii verifice si ei prin inspector autorizat daca au totul in regula, cu o spaga mica am avut un nene care a luat totul la mana si a masurat suprafetele sa vada daca dau la ruleta. La o camera facusera modificari si i-am pus sa o aduca la starea initiala din schita apartamentului
- am insistat sa imi scada banii la anumite finisaje pentru diferite chestii si sa vin eu cu materialele mele. Au fost de acord si i-am convins sa faca manopera pe cheltuiala lor.
- am facut actele la notarul meu, nu al lor. Cei mai multi 'dezvoltatori' au notarul lor uns cu toate alifiile si recomand sa il evitati. Au strambat din nas dar au acceptat pana la urma.
- am avut un contract de condominiu (buna purtare) si pana si ala a fost verificat de avocat ca aveau niste aberatii ce trebuiau corectate.

Sunt multe blocuri facute in graba, sila si doar cu japca in minte. Trebuie rabdare si tupeu cand incepi cautarile. Nu exista, mergem pe incredere in cazul asta. 

Si acum imi vine greu sa cred ca am gasit un complex care sa fie chiar ok construit avand in vedere ce apartamente/blocuri am vazut. 

Multa bafta!

With Campbell, I don't like that he reduces religion to ""early psychology"" and nothing more. He's pretty explicit about that in *Hero With a Thousand Faces*. Maybe he's more nuanced in other writings or interviews but that's what I've gotten from him so far.

I also think he's too dismissive of Christianity and too embracing of the East. For one thing, he seems not to be aware of Eastern Christianity because many of the issues he brings up kind of fall flat when looked at from the Orthodox perspective. For another, there's a lot of really powerful symbolism in Christianity (even Western) that is worth exploring.

Finally, I'm not a fan of the monomyth concept. Not that there's not some truth to it, but different religions have different aims and philosophies. All this despite a great deal of similarities and common use of symbols. It's just a bit too reductionistic for me. 

The Old Testament, for instance, is in many ways a polemic written against other religions of its cultural framework. There is a *very* strong and deliberate theme of subversion throughout the whole thing. 

While I do think religion serves as an early psychology in a lot of ways, and certainly some myths can be viewed as pure psychology, I see religion more as the outer expression (not merely projection) of inner forces. In other words, reality is a fractal, where one level is present at every other, as opposed to being merely representational.

As for Frazer, his idea was that all religions were about the dying/resurrecting god motif. It's a damn good read, but his scholarship turned out to be a little subpar, and he tried to reduce the myths too much, in my opinion.

Some of his evidence of resurrecting gods turns out to have come from myths invented after Christianity was spreading. For a while, this was used as evidence that Christians had borrowed the concept, but in all likelihood it was the opposite. 

Moreover, he ties this to the cycle of vegetation, and that is characteristic of Earth Mother cults. Not all religions fit this mold. There are patriarchal Sky Father religions, from which Greek, Norse, Celtic, Indic, and other Indo European religions come (in combination with the Earth Mother cults they encountered as they spread). There are shamanistic religions which are unrelated to both (although obviously they all evolved out of shamanistic practices). Christianity and Judaism are of quite a different fabric altogether. 

So the hypothesis died a few decades after his book was released, but he definitely sparked an invaluable interest in comparative religion.

if you want to understand more of the lore and also still preffering the survival horror i suggest (i didn't play the revelations 1 or 2 games so i cannot comment about them BUT ircc they are canon spin-offs so you can check if want):

  
RE 1 HD for current gen =best way to start getting all the info about the first survivors, meet Claire brother and the first documented case of the T virus).

  
RE 0  HD for current gen = a prequel of the first game that help people understand how all started, skippable but if you enjoy the history (and rebecca) a must to play

&amp;#x200B;

After this 2 games if you want to know what happen to Jill's, resident evil 3 nemesis is your choice; if you prefer a more canon game following claire whereabouts, Code Veronica X ; all this 4 games represent the ""classic"" experience of the survival horror genre... after this  all the other games are more action oriented with over the shoulder view like the new RE 2

&amp;#x200B;

Resident Evil 4  = the first action-horror  RE game having a more experienced Leon Scott Kennedy working to the US president on a mission in Europe saving the president daughter, the most important things about this game are the behavior of the new enemies and instead of being slows pieces of meat, they are aggresive people who actually can coordinate and flank if they want; this game started a lot of trends of the new resident evils (except for 7):

\- Over the shoulder view

\- Fast enemies and usually instead of being 1-3 difficult enemies, they are more fast, intelligent and usually attack in groups

\- Leon is a badass protagonist that can use melee attacks for saving ammo and also spread aways the enemies

\- Ability to aim in whatever part you want instead of just 3 fixed angles

Resident Evil 5 = a sequel developing more of the OVERTHETOP action, this time instead of being on a scort mission you actually have a ~~dumb ia~~ partner that can help you solving ""puzzles"", managing inventory, and fight vs more intelligent, fast and furious enemies... look at this game as a RE 4 with steroids and one (of my opinion) best of the co-op shooter games (without counting arcade games or gears of war), another must play game and ALSO PUNCH &gt; ROCK

also if you play it on a pc try to mod out the yellow lookish of the game and always try to play with a partner, really more  fun

Resident Evil 6 = MORE OVER THE TOP ACTION WITH QUICK TIME EVENTS FIRE EXPLOSIONS; honestly by the time RE 6 was released people was sick of the action packed movie with just some angry enemy people, capcom really tried to incorporate again the survival without success, considered the black sheep of the franchise you love it or hate it (also a good co-op game but if you play it, just don't have too much expectations)

Resident Evil 7 = a frest start but still part of the canon series, with new characters, new perspective (first view), going back to the core principles of the survival horror genre, you are now a normal human without any kind of militarry or police experience trying to solve a mistery about your wife dissaparance.

B) Victor Shokin, the prosecutor that Joe Biden boasted about getting fired, wasn’t actively investigating the Burisma CEO or the company. He had shelved the investigation prior to Hunter Biden joining the company because he was corrupt and not being **tough enough** on crime.  The reason the American Government, the EU, the International Monetary Fund, and anti-corruption advocates wanted Shokin removed was because of how he was letting organized crime flourish in Ukraine, not because he was being tough.  Biden having Shokin fired actually increased the chances of his son’s company facing legal troubles.  Anti-corruption activists *in Ukraine* have testified to this: the only person holding up the investigation into Hunter Biden’s company was the person Joe Biden bragged about firing!

I was unemployed for a bit after I had broken my collar bone. Collecting unemployment has requirements that include looking for jobs. 

In order to fulfill job hunting requirements, I had a copy paste cover-letter/resume that I would send to 5 places a week. Everything in it was vague, but I edited it to add a detail or two from the job posting to show that I'm *interested.* I sent all of these applications to the unemployment office as well so there was a paper trail.

I wasn't expecting any of these jobs to get back to me as I didn't have my heart set on any. Just biding my time until the perfect job shows up that I will be happy with. 

One place ends up asking me to come in for an interview. They give me the website and let me know to check that out before had to be ready. The link didn't work, so I didn't bother looking online before I went in. My goal was just to add this to another list of things that I did for my unemployment requirements.

I disagree. In the US people are literally COMPLETELY closed off to socialism. They hear the word socialism and immediately shut down with ""it's evil"". We can't even get fucking universal healthcare. Leftist rhetoric in Europe is absolutely better.

&gt;Once the proletariat has been given the things that trade unionism and socdem reform can provide that will be their only interest, atrocities abroad which prop up those reforms be damned.

We're the same way in the US. And we can't don't even provide those things. Like how on earth do you think the US is more ready for any kind of leftist movement than Europe?

&gt;Consider this: social democracy in Europe gave rise to Blairism, wherein not only is the third world exploited but the people at home have their rights steadily stripped under the guise of progressivism because the welfare state is kept largely intact while being “saved” from cuts, despite still being invested in less than before the cuts took place. It actually becomes even harder to fight the liberals because it looks like they’re the ones trying to save your precious child benefits. Now how do you think Nancy Pelosi would do with that setup? How much harder would it be to remove the dem establishment?

We do that in the US too. And further a lot of those social benefits that Europe has, the US doesn't. We're further away from any kind of leftist reform than Europe is. Like I don't even know how this is arguable. 

&gt;Now how do you think Nancy Pelosi would do with that setup? How much harder would it be to remove the dem establishment?

It's proven virtually impossible to make any progress with the current establishment. Like you're arguing about benefits that are being slashed the US doesn't even have. AND OUR CITIZENS ARE OKAY WITH IT. Further, they're actually arguing that implementing any of these social programs is ""evil"". American exceptionalism is insane man.

Anglo countries you say, ok. Never head of it in the UK or Australia or New Zealand where they say &lt;&lt;cunt&gt;&gt; 300 times a day, but if you say so...

I've not been to Liverpool™ yet, in my life. I had no reason to go, before I started watching at the beginning of last year. But baseball wasn't enough for me anymore, so I went looking for a Premier League team to watch. Football (to me, soccer) isn't as big a deal here in the US, so the quality of team is...substantially lower -- and I wanted to see what all the fuss was really about.

Yes, I was attracted to the ludicrous scoreline, the incredibly FUN atmosphere of the Champions League games -- and only later discovered that Anfield is a legendary ground for European nights.

As I mentioned before, I am also a fan of baseball. For those of y'all that don't watch, it's one of the more romantic games people play. I don't mean 'romantic' in the usual way people use it, I mean that feeling you get when you think of glory days gone by.

When things were good.

It takes hard times, really hard times, to appreciate those short moments of dominance from your favorite team. I'm a Mets fan, and lord knows we've had some glory days...but we've had far more years in which they've been just good enough to lose in the most agonizing way possible. And that was the other thing that I loved about Liverpool™.

They hadn't been good, recently, when I started watching. Their star player wanted to leave for a giant team for, effectively, more money (endorsements are more valuable if Coutinho is wearing a Barca shirt). They're a team of their city, not this oil-money-fueled, soulless machine you'd find in Man City, or Chelsea. When they won, they celebrated with their teammates, gloried in their achievements, but...there was always an acknowledgement of the Kop. They loved us as much as we loved them.

And I ate it up.

I read books. I read articles. I voraciously consumed every single link to every video or blog or wiki I could find. I was obsessed beyond all reason.

I haven't watched this team as long as y'all. But I'll take the Pepsi challenge with just about anyone in describing Klopp's tactics, at this point, and how they differ from Mourinho, or Pep, or Rafa. I can tell you the history of You'll Never Walk Alone, why we don't link the S*n, about Bill Shankly, about Torres' Anfield debut, about Superman Suarez and the heartbreak they both caused, and about less obvious players, like a super Croat who used to be atrocious.

Point is, I haven't had time to become salty against the new kids, because like you I AM the new kid. But I also learned a LOT this last year. And I did it while holding down two jobs and being a dad to a two year old. So...you can too, man. You really can, if you actually care. And if you don't?

**Article**:

&gt; WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday objected to a move by the U.S. House of Representatives to obtain depositions from five current and former State Department officials as part of an impeachment inquiry targeting President Donald Trump, accusing Democrats of bullying and intimidation. 

&gt; The five have been scheduled to give depositions this week and next as the Democratic-led House looks into Trump’s request to Ukraine’s president during a July phone call to investigate a domestic political rival, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. 

&gt; The officials “may not attend any interview or deposition” without executive branch counsel present to control disclosure of confidential information and questioned, Pompeo wrote in a letter to House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel. 

&gt; Engel and two other Democratic committee chairmen issued a statement accusing Pompeo of “stonewalling” the impeachment inquiry, and called him a “fact witness” in the investigation based on media reports that he had listened in on the call. 

&gt; “He should immediately cease intimidating department witnesses in order to protect himself and the president,” Engel and Representatives Adam Schiff and Elijah Cummings said. 

&gt; Democrats last week launched the impeachment effort in light of a whistleblower complaint against the Republican president by a person within the U.S. intelligence community who accused Trump of soliciting foreign interference in the 2020 U.S. election for his personal political benefit. Trump is running for re-election next year. 

&gt; The impeachment inquiry could lead to approval of articles of impeachment - or formal charges - against Trump in the House. That would lead to a trial in the Senate on whether to remove him from office but the president’s fellow Republicans control that chamber and have shown little appetite for removing him. 

&gt; Pompeo, who is in Italy for a three-day trip, objected to Engel’s request for the officials to be made available for depositions. The officials include former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and former U.S. special representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker. 

&gt; In a letter posted on Twitter, Pompeo told Engel, “I am concerned with aspects of your request that can be understood only as an attempt to intimidate, bully and treat improperly the distinguished professionals of the Department of State, including several career Foreign Service Officers, whom the committee is now targeting.” 

&gt; Pompeo expressed “significant legal and procedural concerns” and said he viewed a committee letter to the officials as a “request for a voluntary appearance.” Pompeo said the announced dates for the depositions do not provide enough time for preparation. He also said his department would respond to a Foreign Affairs Committee subpoena by Friday. 

&gt; He said records that have been requested are subject to restrictions relating to classified information and other executive branch privileges. Pompeo added that there is no legal basis for the committee’s assertion that a failure to appear would constitute evidence of obstruction. 

&gt; Pompeo said he would use “all means at my disposal to prevent and expose any attempts to intimidate the dedicated professionals” at the State Department. 

&gt; The other three officials are Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, State Department Counselor T. Ulrich Brechbuhl and U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland. 

&gt; “Any effort to intimidate witnesses or prevent them from talking with Congress - including State Department employees - is illegal and will constitute evidence of obstruction of the impeachment inquiry,” the three Democratic chairmen said. 

&gt; Trump in a July 25 phone call asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Biden and his son Hunter in coordination with U.S. Attorney General William Barr and Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Biden’s son had served as a director for a Ukrainian gas company. 

&gt; Pompeo’s letter marked the latest bid by Trump’s administration to avoid providing House Democrats testimony and documents relating to numerous different investigations of the president. Democrats have accused Trump of a policy of stonewalling legitimate congressional inquiries. 

&gt; On Wednesday, three House committees - Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight - were due to get a deposition from Yovanovitch, whom Trump labeled “bad news” during his call with Ze...

Yes. But I don't believe in redistribution of wealth, because I'm not a commie.


&gt; Have you considered the agriculture the EU sponsors most (75% of the budget I believe) is of vital importance to our survivability, especially with Climate Change on the way?


Agricultural subsidies are paid to refund the EU quotas that prevent farmers / fishers from producing. That's to keep the prices high and to force EU countries to import things instead of producing it. And guess which county is to top exporter in the EU?

No. Unlike BoJo, I'm not worried at all if there's a hard border in Ireland. I just don't think people would start killing each other for a simple border check.

QFT! And micro-plastics are everywhere. I've read that nano-particles cause death of immune cells creating hyperallergic kids, and causing testosterone levels to drop in male bipeds.

So it kind of annoys me that plastic recycling is still such a feel-good word (in both Europe and America) since 30% or more ends up on a trash heap or in an oven. When someone tweeted to TheBigBangTheory why those clever people use so many throw-away bottles and food packaging on the show, they said: ""we recycle!"" as if that negates the problem.

The amount of plastic that is not being recycled probably increases a lot since China stopped buying trash from other countries.

[],,C-Jen,1484444918.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_14g27f,False,False,[],"China's economy and Belt/Road Initiative

The BRI or OBOR was envisioned as a sort of ""Chinese Marshall Plan"", in that China would make economic overtures to developing countries in its sphere of influence and build relations that way. It is almost entirely a product during the current president's term (Xi Jinping, who took power in 2012).

The ""Belt"" refers to the overland countries of Central Asia, the Near East, and Eastern Europe - the idea being that China would help finance the construction of infrastructure, especially hydropower, gas, etc. The ""Road"" refers to the seaways reaching from southern China around Indochina, India, and the Middle East and Africa, and is contemplated to include port facilities, offshore platforms, etc.

China's economic focus appears to be energy stability, as it has been vulnerable to oil embargoes or disruptions to its sealanes from the ME and Africa. China's military modernization program has also focused greatly on naval power projection, with two or more aircraft carriers entering service, and a fleet of destroyer-class vessels to create a true bluewater fleet.

The main motive appears to be to ensure economic growth. China still has an inflexible fixed currency, limited domestic access to tradeable stocks (with complicated banking regulations intended to limit stock speculation by civilians), and restrictions and controls over foreign investments - which have been slowing down in the last few years. As with many non-participatory political systems, the average civilian is generally not able to guide the government's policy, so the government's responses to commoners' complaints can be slow or somewhat schizophrenic. (Beijing's air quality, for example, was notoriously bad for decades - with the central government largely in denial because the factories and smelters had to continue burning to supply the city with fuel for growth and industry. Then, around 2017, the government implemented increased air pollution controls and the air quality became markedly better. At that point it was evident that the credit for solving the problem outweighed any embarrassment for having caused it in the first place.)

Back to Chinese money. The average Chinese citizen has seen a huge improvement in standard of living, but the gains are uneven, and China by many metrics has even overtaken capitalistic USA in social income inequality. Most Chinese save more than 50% of their income for retirement, privately in banks rather than investment pensions (though this is changing). Since 2007, another wildcard has appeared - the Chinese government finally allowed private land ownership. Thus, many families who had some little state-issued apartment in a good location could suddenly sell it to a developer who had visions of gleaming malls and office projects, and reap a huge profit. The modern Chinese leadership philosophy appears to have followed the Soviet maxim of ""we cannot give you political freedoms, but instead we will give you a better way of life than your fathers had"". Unlike the Soviets, the Chinese government does appear to have made good on this promise for the past few decades. (Granted, China was a very backwards country when they began this policy.)

Real estate became the go-to investment vehicle, as the average Chinese can't invest in stocks or get their money out of China. Even the small percentage of Chinese who can get their money out of China, usually tends to cause financial distortions overseas. (See Vancouver, Sydney, and San Francisco as cities where Chinese property speculation has driven up property prices to the point that many locals can no longer afford housing.) China's real estate boom went on smoothly until the mid-2010s, when the housing boom slowed down. Developers continued building, but the consumer's ability to actually afford and pay for these shiny new villas and apartments tapered off. Now, many young Chinese couples need help from their parents, grandparents, and extended family, just to get their first apartment together. The government has tried various policies (limiting ""second household"" purchases, awarding a lottery-based system for city residents and taxpayers, etc.) but of course one of the common problems of economic policy is that you can end up with unforeseen workarounds and perverse incentives. (One well-intentioned rule said that if the gov't gave a couple a free or subsidized house, then if the couple divorces, the gov't should make arrangements so the less-wealthy spouse also has a home - this is usually the wife. This led to numerous couples getting married and getting a gov't sponsored apartment, then getting divorced on paper so the wife got her own place, and then remarrying a short while later, now with two apartments.)

With the slowdown domestically, the Xi administration has been betting on contractual opportunities overseas and on bringing foreign firms to work in China. Now, only a few years in, the contractual penalties of taking part have been heavy - such as port facilities and airports being lost to Chinese control due to the host government's inability to pay. Critics say that this was China's intention all along - to drive a hard bargain in the knowledge that it would be defaulted upon, and then claim the asset overseas. Others point to the slowdown gripping China's economy as well as overseas nations, and the fact that unforeseen factors have raised the cost of business for everybody.

Ideologically, previous US administrations had a focus on promoting democracy worldwide, and oftentimes would make economic aid contingent on democratic policies in the target country. (Though there are always exceptions - see e.g. Saudi Arabia.) China intentionally sidestepped that, providing aid to African, South East Asian, and Middle Eastern countries without regard to their political systems. While this is part of BRI, it also has roots from long before - Communist China has traditionally cultivated strong ties to the ""Third World"" nations that the US and USSR overlooked. In 1971 when mainland China was admitted to the United Nations, for example, it was largely through the votes of poorer developing nations, especially in Africa, that resulted in the Nationalist government in Taiwan losing recognition and the Communist government in Beijing gaining it.

SD can also produce hair loss /bald patches because the root of the hair is being suffocated by the dandruff..and it causes inflammatory reaction.

Ketokonazole is too harsh, drying. And products with selenium sulfide are ok but can take longer to see the effect -few weeks when I tried.

Title: **People who UNDERSTAND IMMIGRATION. Please help me out**

Original Post: 

&gt; Summary: I'm on F1 STEM OPT status. I work for a big company. Meeting with higher ups tomorrow. The company wants to sponsor me from F1 TO EB3 green card directly, without H-1B (which is plain stupid, I can spend 20 years applying the H-1B and still not get it... lottery? no thanks..). Here's my question: They lawyer claims it will take longer for the green card to get ready than my current status expires, hence there won't be enough time for the green card to get ready.
&gt; 
&gt; What I claim - and I have had a friend from the same nationality as me who did the exact same thing a few months ago (I'm from a small European country so all my dates in visa bulletin are current) - concurrently filed for I-485 and I-765 employment authorization with advanced parole. That allowed him to still work in the US while he was still waiting for his green card. I am pretty efin sure that once I submit the I-485 I can also extend my stay while I wait for the green card and still work and live in the country..
&gt; 
&gt; Are my lawyers idiots and should I fight this? Or are they correct and I cannot get any special status while waiting for the green card process. PLEASE HELP ME OUT ON THIS ONE, LIKE MY LIFE DEPENDS ON IT. Thank you very much!!

Once you leave aside coastal regions and earthquake zones and the vicinity of supervolcanoes there is not much land left, at least in Europe (besides european Russia).  
  
&gt;&gt; And before you say something about the distribution of the global earthquake hazard, AGW and fast glacial melts will drastically increase earthquakes (100-1000x) and volcanic activity, thus indirectly also causing ice slides and landslides, some of which under water (such as the Storegga Slide) which create tsunamies.  
  
&gt; That is not how plate tectonics work  
  
Strawman. Glacial and marine isostatic adjustments are not due to plate tectonics.  
But it could impact Icelandic volcanic activities when the glaciers there melt off rapidly.  
And volcanoes at or near the Alps (esp including those in Italy).  
  
&gt; The last pre-1900s major tsunami-causing eruption was in 1883  
  
That was a small one and near the Ring of Fire.  
  
&gt;&gt; Thus all the reactors below 50 meters of altitude and up to 50km from the coast are vulnerable to tsunamies.  
  
&gt; Except that, as we've mentioned, a shift of a couple degrees on the surface does not affect plate tectonics.  
  
Which, as we've mentioned, is a strawman.  
  
&gt;&gt; And all reactors could be vulnerable to supervolcano ash and to solar superstorms (up to 10-100x larger than the Carrington event).  
  
&gt; I can understand how if you're particularly uninformed or crazy you might think global warming could warm the earth's core, that at least has a connection, but how the fuck is it supposed to affect the sun?  
  
Two more strawmen.  
I haven't claimed planetary core heating. Nor have I claimed AGW affecting solar activities.  
  
&gt; Also, solar panels and wind turbines are also destroyed by major solar events.  
  
Offshore wind turbines not so much.  
And small-scale concentrated solar would be unaffected.  
  
&gt; 2-4x cost increase of renewables is tolerable and preferable over nuclear.  
  
&gt; How?  
  
I already gave the reference to triple-redundant renewable energy production.  
  
&gt;&gt; A single nuclear meltdown in France is estimated to cost up to 6 trillion EUR. With multiple meltdowns the cost function would increase more than a simple additive function. The global private insurance sector is simply not large enough to cover potential costs in case of a continental or global nuclear disaster (due to tsunamies or supervolcano ash or destructive solar superstorms).  
  
&gt; Except that the odds are astronomically low.  
  
All the more reason to demand full private insurance.  
  
&gt; The last full meltdown occurred in an outdated graphite moderated reactor in the 80s and their's only been a single partial meltdown since then.  
  
Fukushima had 3 full meltdowns.  
And the main causes of all nuclear accidents have been social - which is something that we can't quite get rid of entirely, unless you suggest going to full AI supervision.  
  
&gt;&gt; Next generation - our bright future, coming in 50 years from now, as always. But if new designs reduce insurance costs, then there should be no problem demanding full private insurance over the full lifecycle.  
  
&gt; We literally already built some. They're not 50 years away, they're zero years away.  
  
Excellent. So then it should be no problem demanding full private insurance over the full lifecycle.  
  
&gt;&gt; Quite the contrary, it very much does have to do with it. Ocean acidification is a proxy to (near future) glacial melt.  
  
&gt; They are caused by different things. Ocean acidification is caused by the release of acidic compounds into the ocean while glacial melt is controlled by global temperature.  
  
Both are caused by fossil CO2 emissions into the fast carbon cycle.  
  
&gt; One cannot be used to effectively predict the other.  
  
It very much can be used for that.  
  
&gt;&gt; The volume is not significantly smaller, merely 2x smaller. The end of the ice age took 10-15 000 years (although the holocene climate optimum was 8000 years ago, in some regions of Canada and Scandinavia the glaciers reached minimum a few millennia later). Compared to that, AGW is already 100x faster.  
  
&gt; 2x smaller is pretty significant my guy.  
  
No, it isn't.  
It merely means that there is no more than about 63 meters of global sea level equivalent to melt.

My timeline's 2WK started early thanks to Neosanfedisti, and (maybe because of that) lasted for less than 3 years. I wanted to see if Pax Europaea was achievable so I let Nat France back in return for joining Reichspakt (I admit I used console commands for this one, but AI never does it on its own and I really wanted to see how it goes). Most of Europe was brought together under Reichspakt:
- Ferdinando united Italy as organic empire
- UBD turned itself into multiethnic federation 
- Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine went a little bit less wholesome path and went NatPop but stayed in Reichspakt

The only non-Reichspakt countries were:
- My newly created Nordic Federation
- Karl's blessed Donau-Adriabund
- Spanish Republic under Franco, which was still consolidating after the civil war 
- Poland enjoying its splendid isolation
- Portugal and Sardinia as the last vestiges of the Entente

The only other war in Europe was attempt of Dmitri Romanov to restore Imperial borders, but he messed up, started a war with 5 fronts and Russia was balkanised even more.

Meanwhile Canada has built its new colonial empire in Americas:
- It restored the Mexican Empire (and later gave it lands of defeated Liberal Pact)
- Secured alliance with Panama and Hawaii 
- Puppeted the Brazilian Empire after its failed attack on Guayana
- (Curiously, Canada didn’t intervene in the 2nd ACW, which was won by Huey and thus the US never joined the Entente)

Africa is like 2/3 Reichspakt (Mittelafrika under NKR + French colonies), while south is mostly with the Entente (Dominionist South Africa + Portuguese colonies) and north-east is controlled by Ottoman puppets.

In Asia the major powers are a bit weaker:
- The Entente possesses unified India and NatPop Australasia
- The Reichspakt still controls the Pacific Islands and GEA (minus Indochina)

I will decide on my canon on Asia after the rework is out, but so far it appears that Qing and Mongolian empires are slowly but surely beating back the Co-prosperity Sphere, which should lead to some interesting scenarios for  Cold War power struggles.

&gt; Eric Whitacre (born 2 January 1970 in Reno, NV) is an American composer of choral, wind band and electronic music. He has also served as a guest conductor for ensembles throughout Europe, Asia, Australia and the Americas.

&gt; An accomplished composer, conductor and lecturer, Eric Whitacre has quickly become one of the most popular and performed composers of his generation. The Los Angeles Times has praised his compositions as ""works of unearthly beauty and imagination, (with) electric, chilling harmonies""; while the BBC raves that ""what hits you straight between the eyes is the honesty, optimism and sheer belief that passes any pretension. This is music that can actually make you smile.”

&gt; Though he had received no formal training before the age of 18, his first experiences singing in college choir changed his life, and he completed his first concert work, Go, Lovely, Rose, at the age of 21. Eric went on to the Juilliard School, earning his Master of Music degree and studying with Pulitzer Prize- and Oscar-winning composer John Corigliano.

&gt; Many of Whitacre's works have entered the standard choral and symphonic repertories and have become the subject of several recent scholarly works and doctoral dissertations. His works Water Night, Cloudburst, Sleep, Lux Aurumque and A Boy and a Girl are among the most popular choral works of the last decade, and his Ghost Train, Godzilla Eats Las Vegas, and October have achieved equal success in the symphonic wind community. To date, Whitacre's published works have received thousands of performances and have sold well over 750,000 copies worldwide. He has received composition awards from the Barlow International Composition Competition, the American Choral Directors Association and the American Composers Forum. In 2001, Whitacre became the youngest recipient ever awarded the coveted Raymond C. Brock commission by the American Choral Directors Association. 

&gt; As a conductor, Whitacre has appeared with hundreds of professional and educational ensembles throughout the world. In the last ten years he has conducted concerts of his choral and symphonic music in Japan, Australia, China, Singapore, South America and much of Europe, as well as dozens of American universities and colleges where he regularly conducts seminars and lectures with young musicians. Over the past few years, these loyal fans and supporters have moved online, spreading Eric’s popularity to an ever-expanding worldwide audience. Upcoming commissions include works for The King’s Singers with the National Youth Choir of Great Britain, the London Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, and an oratorio - featuring full orchestra, choir, and soloists – celebrating the opening of the new Long Center for the Performing Arts in Austin, TX.

&gt; His music has been featured on dozens of commercial and independent recordings. His first recording, The Music of Eric Whitacre, was hailed by The American Record Guide as one of the top ten classical albums of 1997. In 2006, a full collection of his a cappella music, Cloudburst and Other Choral Works, was released on the renowned British classical label Hyperion Records. The album quickly became an international best seller, appearing in the top ten of both Billboard’s and iTune’s Top Classical Albums charts. Two years after its debut, the critically acclaimed release continues to be a top-seller. The collection earned a 2007 Grammy nomination for Best Choral Performance.

&gt; Most recently, Whitacre has received acclaim for Paradise Lost: Shadows and Wings, a cutting edge musical combining trance, ambient and techno electronica with choral, cinematic, and operatic traditions. Winner of the ASCAP Harold Arlen award, this musical also gained Whitacre the prestigious Richard Rodgers Award for most promising musical theater composer. Following its sold-out run, the most recent production earned 10 nominations at the 2007 Los Angeles Stage Alliance Ovation Awards, including one for Best World Premiere Musical.

&gt; Mr. Whitacre lives in Los Angeles with his wife, celebrated soprano Hila Plitmann, and their son.

[],,[deleted],,,,,,,dark,,,,,[],"What people don't understand, aside from the fact that getting rid of FoM is an exercise in reducing the opportunities and status of 60+ million British nationals vis-a-vis their European counterparts, is that FoM just isn't as unpopular as it has been made out to be.

A lot of time an energy has been invested in immigration control narratives, and \*lots\* of people now take it for granted what it implies, by for instance calling the referendum a vote about FoM. Even people who are fine with FoM feel dutybound to make statements like these, 'well that's just how it is'. 

Don't get me wrong, the referendum campaign was certainly swung on the basis of talking constantly about immigration, but support for FoM in the UK is \*far\* greater than what it seems to be, if you just look at the multitude of data points we have been generating since 2016. For instance, even leave voters thought we'd keep FoM just before and after the referendum. Multiple studies have shown FoM is supported by a majority when framed as a controlled type of immigration (it is not the principle of people being able to come here and work and do their bit that people object to). And in terms of Brexit scenarios that are supported, there have been multiple studies showing that a large group of leavers would not be opposed to solutions that involved FoM, such as the Norway model, which to this day is a scenario that a majority could live with. There is more than enough support for FoM in the UK for it to continue, if it wanted.

TM was every bit as awful as Patel in presenting the removal of FoM as a prize, but it's empty calories for the populace. After it is instituted it's enactment won't satiate voters who felt it important, because net immigration levels will alter in composition but still remain well above the targets that Tories promised (and has anyone noticed the Tories abolished the 100k target without backlash, there's a hint). 

The primary value of promoting anti-FoM policy was to have something to blame and focus on, not the actual supposed benefits of 'controlling Europeans settling in the UK'. Delivering on the policy creates a vacuum for what the actual value of having the policy was. Reducing EU national net immigration figures is not a prize, it won't give the politicians political capital to work with. It will certainly create a slew of negative repercussions that may lead to resent  with politicians.

The OP's questions asked specifically about whether or not the actions taken against ethnic Germans in post-war Eastern Europe could be considered a genocide. In my original post I answered in the negative and offered instead that it might be thought of as ethnic cleansing. To really get something from this discussion it is imperative to understand the differences in the ways historians use those terms. To quote /u/hillsonghoods 

&gt; with regard to this particular topic, it’s important to be absolutely clear with terminology for a non-specialist audience - the differences intended by ‘ethnic cleansing’ and ‘genocide’ (and the differences that are not intended) definitely to be explained very clearly for the topic to be clearly understood. Could you edit your post to expand upon this a bit?

With that in mind, I offer this distinction...

When we speak about genocide we speak of actions which are a part of a larger, concerted, organized, and officially sanctioned program that has as its aim the complete eradication of a people based on either racial, ethnic, religious, sexual, or any other superficial difference. The most important part of this understanding is that the aim of a genocide is **complete eradication** of a people. To make them extinct. To erase them from the world and and from history. Using this definition as a lens for understanding, we see the actions taken by Nazis against undesirables in Europe fit this criteria exactly, therefore it is accurate and consistent to refer to the Holocaust as a genocide. Similarly one can understand the Hutu attacks against Tutsi Rwandans as a genocide since the facts of what happened in Rwanda fit under our definition of genocide. The Rwandan genocide was; racially motivated, highly organized, officially sanctioned (this might come down to what ""official"" means in a country fighting a civil war, but certainly we can see where power resided in Rwandan society and delineate in this way), and had as its stated goal the complete elimination of the Tutsi race. 

Having established what genocide is, we must now turn to what it is not. The example I use most frequently when teaching or explaining the distinction between genocide and ethnic cleansing is the relationship between Ireland and Great Britain. For years British policy towards the Irish and Ireland was hostile and sought to control and dominate Irish society. Many Irish were forced off their lands and removed from their homes for no other reason than to grant Great Britain dominion over valuable land. The Irish were starved, coerced, and killed as direct consequence of decisions made at the highest levels of British government. However, calling these actions genocidal would be inaccurate. At no time did England seek to eliminate the Irish people. Instead they sought domination and removal. 

Situations like the one I just described is we usually mean when we use the term ""ethnic cleansing."" Ethnic cleansing *can* involve direct acts of violence and even mass killing, but the goals of ethnic cleansing are markedly different. States that undertake policies of ethnic cleansing do so with the hope of dominating and controlling a minority or otherwise undesirable population, and do so with the intent that they will be removed and replaced from wherever they currently are. The distinction may seem trivial, but it must be made if we are to gain more complete understandings of actions and consequences. 

It is also important to keep in mind what the distinction between these terms does NOT do and that is elevate one act over the other or provide a moral justification for things that aren't ""as bad"" as genocide. Both genocide and ethnic cleansing are morally reprehensible acts that have incalculable impact on people and places and neither should be considered more morally correct than the other. Just because ethnic cleansing does not necessarily encompass extinction does not make it ""better"" than genocide. This is not necessarily to say the two terms are EQUALLY bad either, just for us to understand that the terms are different, mean different things, and must be used in their appropriate contexts. 

I hope this clears things up and passes muster for this community!
 
**Original Post**

I'm taking a class right now that has covered this so I can speak on it, to a point. 

Your biggest question, can this be considered a genocide?, is an important one to address right away. If you're stacking these actions up against Nazi actions against Jews, Slavs, etc. I don't think it's accurate to characterize postwar violence against Germans as a genocide. The scale, methods, and motivations are just too different. I'd be more inclined to call it state sanctioned ethnic cleansing and would point out rampant acts of violence against ethnic Germans that were carried out by both private citizens and official statement representatives with varying levels of official acceptance depending on time and place.

Another important thing to remember is that even though the war officially ended for the state belligerents, that does not necessarily mean the war itself, in all practical terms, ended at the same time. The part of Europe to which you are referring was the site of perhaps the most devastating fighting of the European theatre, and beyond that was absolutely ravaged by the Nazis. The disruption and violence caused by the expulsion of Jews and Slavs and the imposition of German racial orthodoxy cannot be overstated. Many people also benefited from the absence of their neighbors and collaboration with Nazi Invaders. The memory of these events was powerful and persistent and the collapse of Nazi Germany did not somehow wipe away the feelings and experiences of the people who lived through the occupation and the war. 

All this to say that ill-will against Germans was at exceptional levels in 1945 and with the retreat of Nazi power the fear of reprisals for acting on this resentment and rage from Germans, Nazi and otherwise, was also lifted. The ethnic cleansing that occurred did indeed draw a blind eye from Allied leadership and the Soviets in part because intervention on behalf of German citizens in these places was considered anathema. For the Soviets specifically there was surely an element of ""score settling"" against the Germans considering the Soviet experience in the Eastern front. For the US one might say their hands were more or less tied since most of what you're curious about happened within the Soviet sphere outside of Allied influence. However, there doesn't seem to have been much of an effort by the US to intervene on Germany's behalf. 

Some books I can recommend on this topic are ...

Under a Cruel Star - Heda Kovaly: memoir of Heda Kovaly, Eastern European Jew writing about her escape from concentration camps, surviving during the war, and navigating life in Soviet dominated Eastern Europe.

Dark Continent - Mark Mazower: contains chapters that deal directly with your question.

Firing Shokin was US foreign policy, EU foreign policy, and IMF policy since he was seen as a bad actor not working against corruption and  the governments of these bodies didn't want to give away aid money without an anti-corruption initiative.

This is why Biden said this in front of the Council of Foreign Relations, because he was talking about foreign policy in an open and transparent way.

Contrast this with Trump, who was also trying to use aid money to meet an end, doing so in absolute secret, then working to cover up any mention or record of his actions, and going around the institutions of government by having a ""personal attorney"" engaged in this as well.  Why is Trump's personal attorney involved in the distribution of US tax dollars in aid?  Why not a US government employee? Could it be the actions of one are easier to cover than the other?  Could it be that Rudy Giuliani represents Trump and not the US and Trump is using those tax dollars for his benefit not the country's?

Yeah there were plenty in the mix who jumped at the chance, but there were *millions* of people in these places. Everyone who didn't express loyalty to the new regime was considered an open target for those who did, so yeah... nightmare for everyone. Same dynamic happened in the retaliatory ethnic cleansing during the postwar period: kill them, or else you must be one of them, and need to be killed too.

They aren't bound by rules, they aren't limited to doing their own handiwork themselves. They're as close to the concept of evil as we've really come as a civilization.

People couldn't just say no. That's fundamentally how Facism works. People under a Facist system don't get choices, because most choices that aren't compliance lead to their deaths. That's how it's so evil. It's the worst type of Authoritarian political structure yet devised.

Because of a defamatory work of fiction, “The Deputy”,  written in 1963 by a little-known German PROTESTANT playwright, Rolf Hochhuth, Pius XII's wartime record has been unjustly tarnished.

The Israeli diplomat and scholar Pinchas Lapide concluded his careful review of Pius XII's wartime activities with the following words: “The Catholic Church, under the pontificate of Pius XII, was instrumental in saving the lives of as many as 860,000 Jews from certain death at Nazi hands.” He went on to add that this “figure far exceeds those saved by all other Churches and rescue organizations combined.” After recounting statements of appreciation from a variety of preeminent Jewish spokespersons, he noted. “No Pope in history has been thanked more heartily by Jews.”

At the Eichmann Nazi War Crimes Trial in 1961, Jewish scholar Jeno Levai testified that the Bishops of the Catholic Church “intervened again and again on the instructions of the Pope.” In 1968, he wrote that “the one person (Pius XII) who did more than anyone else to halt the dreadful crime and alleviate its consequences, is today made the scapegoat for the failures of others.” In “The Secret War Against the Jews” in 1994, Jewish writers John Loftus and Mark Aarons write that “Pope Pius XII probably rescued more Jews than all the Allies combined.”

The Pope's efforts did not go unrecognized by Jewish authorities, even during the War. The Chief Rabbi of Jerusalem, Isaac Herzog, sent the Pope a personal message of thanks on February 28, 1944, in which he said: “The people of Israel will never forget what His Holiness and his illustrious delegates, inspired by the eternal principles of religion which form the very foundations of true civilization, are doing for us unfortunate brothers and sisters in the most tragic hour of our history, which is living proof of Divine Providence in this world.”

In September 1945, Dr. Joseph Nathan —who represented the Hebrew Commission —stated: “Above all, we acknowledge the Supreme Pontiff and the religious men and women who, executing the directives of the Holy Father, recognized the persecuted as their brothers and, with great abnegation, hastened to help them, disregarding the terrible dangers to which they were exposed.”

Dr. A. Leo Kubowitzki, secretary general of the World Jewish Congress, came to present “to the Holy Father, in the name of the Union of Israelitic Communities, warmest thanks for the efforts of the Catholic Church on behalf of Jews throughout Europe during the war.”",True,False,False,,,0,1569979189,,False,0,{},f25nr0t,False,t3_dbvowh,False,True,t1_f25kr59,/r/prochoice/comments/dbvowh/her_choice_read_left_to_right/f25nr0t/,False,,1578067753,-1,True,[],False,prochoice,t5_2rg0n,r/prochoice,public,0,

America has a much more violent criminal subculture than other first world countries. Of the 952 people killed by police in 2015, [830 of them were in possession of a weapon.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/police-shootings/) In America, all racial demographics, be they black, Asian, white... have way higher crime rates than their counterparts in other first world nations. Take our crime index and compare it with Europe - we're number 1 in terms of rape, murder, assault, just about any crime you can imagine.

Now, one of the ways this manifests itself is in an unusually high amount of police violence. Why? Because we have an unusually high amount of retarded criminals that think they can win in a stand-off with the police. And of those deranged idiots that try to attack the police, there's ""disproportionately"" more black criminals involved if you don't factor in their already disproportionate representation in perpetrators of violent crime. It's not discrimination that 27% of people killed by police are black - because the police aren't shooting ""civilians,"" they're shooting ""violently stupid criminals,"" of which there is a larger overlap with black people. 

And if you think this is racist, just look over the Washington Post stats again. 90-95% of people killed by police are men. Is this because the police force is secretly sexist and the matriarchy is implementing institutional sexism to target men? No, it's because men commit anywhere from 85-90% of violent crime each year (too lazy to cite this, just google the fbi stats), so men form a large composition of the ""violently stupid criminals"" group. On a similar train of thought, pay attention to Asians whenever their stats are listed. I know off the top of my head they make up 6% of the US population but only 1.5% of the prison population - is this because we have an Asian supremacist system that enforces biases towards other minorities and even whites?

Thunberg's main point is to draw attention to the issue of climate change that is being ignored by far too many. He says in the Op-ed that ""science is what will solve the problem eventually"". Which is true and it's good to hear that he agrees that climate change is a problem, but there are many people elected into positions of power that don't listen to the science and would rather refer to their personal beliefs in place of scientific studies. The ignorance of some politicians is what Thunberg is railing on about and it's a message that needs to be heard. 

The use of the word ""eventually"" is also telling. He thinks of climate change as an abstract idea and not an imminent threat that is actively threatening the planet. He casually mentions that ""there is no doubt that as deserts eat into currently habitable places in Africa and the Middle East, Europe will face an unimaginable refugee crisis,"" so why not do something today to prevent an ""unimaginable refugee crisis""? We haven't even adequately dealt with the Syrian refugee crisis and there may be a worse one coming in the future? Let's use our resources to fix it.  

This essentially boils down to two different view points. One person has an idealistic view of the current political systems ability to face an existential threat and another is critical of that same system. Two people who agree on the core issue but disagree about an effective way to combat it. 

My opinion of Clarkson is unchanged. The article itself doesn't have any major argumentative weight. His use of what-about-isms in the article were very annoying and only served to distract from the main issue. The only criticism levied towards Thunberg is towards her personal life and circumstances. As Thunberg has pointed out recently, when critics focus on making fun of your personality that means they can't criticize your ideas. And that is exactly what Clarkson has done.

1) Situation in the West is declining. Depression, tense politics, generally unhappy populace.

2) A man realises that a good profit is to be made by buying up farmland there, perhaps even helping the nation a bit 

3) After seeing somewhat favourable results, he recommends to his friends and those in similar circles, to do so.

4) Time passes, a significant population of generally white farmers (From Europe, America, Australia) exists. Produce and jobs created help bring the country out of the economic dip.

5) The government (Former Guerilla Group during the Bush War/Second Chimurenga) adopts laws restricting max land owned by foreign-born citizens as a result of the rest of the country being wary of a whites having a monopoly on farming once again.

6) More restrictive laws are introduced over time, police and military elements begin raiding non-compliant farms, encountering stiff resistance (Farmers like their guns and their land, just saying).

7) Situation escalates and a local group working with the Raids initiates a massacre of the survivors of a well-defended farm raid, to much outcry.

8) Farmers, their employees, and sympathetic locals collectivise their wealth and band together, thus declaring an independent republic, about 500,000 people strong.

9) Army moves to quell resistance, underestimating the hardy people who know the area, and get beaten up by guerilla tactics, the force lead by many former military men, and experienced locals.

10) Interested volunteers fly in to assist the rebels, bolstering their number by another 50,000, including old White Zimbabweans.

11) The Rebels use private helicopters to get behind the enemy very effectively, and take Bulawayo while the Army isn't looking, crushing the local security force.

12) The overstretched and bogged down mechanised force of the Army fails to prevent the rebels from connecting their territory with Bulawayo, and get forced to retreat over the Shangani and Gwayi Rivers, the borders now claimed.

13) Agricultural trade and produce provided to neighboring countries proves invaluable, and the skill of many immigrating Westerners bolster their other services and goods, creating more wealth and a slowly increasing GDP.

14) Despite the war not being resolved, Zimbabwean militarily backed militias cause skirmishes on the border and within the micronation. The country is a divisive topic in Zimbabwe.

15) Ariësland becomes recognised enough to apply to the UN, but is vetoed by the UK. Nonetheless, it is somewhat recognised by most western nations, particularly small ones.

16) The nation being focused on Agriculture, population mostly farmers, politics are almost unanimously Libertarian Right.

With few exceptions, only Europe and the Mediterranean World had heard the Faith. And those few regions outside that sphere - Ethiopia, India - weren't in communion with Rome and all, and hadn't been for many centuries. Is this a proof, or a disproof, of anything? No.

The Roman church got a ""head start"" on evangelizing the globe due to the strategic position of Spain, France and Portugal on the Atlantic coast.

That's all - and now that modern technology and transport allows for a revolutionary connection of all peoples in all places, Orthodoxy finally has the opportunity to spread on a broad level that was geopolitically impossible in prior centuries.

In the same way that if your title is ""Member of Technical Staff, Autonomous Off-road Motorcycles"" and you just put ""Software Engineer"", generally no one is going to bat an eye (although the former title is cooler...).

Don't get fancy and invent titles--as long as you do something sufficiently generic that describes what you did (build software) rather than a formal role within the org, most companies will be entirely fine with it.

&gt; You live in a country that benefited from exploring other countries for resources and free/cheap labour.

This definitely happens, but your view of how people get rich seems to be overly simplistic and unrealistically zero-sum. Trade is not always zero-sum. The US trades quite a bit with the UK and other wealthy European countries, and both parties benefit. There are also historical factors that were just situational and not exploitative. For example, the US got rich being the only industrialized nation mostly untouched by war. That boom carried through until at least the 80s as other nations rebuilt, and still has an impact today. And the US was large and resource rich, etc. There are many factors, and not all of them relate to slaves and bare-subsistence wage labor in foreign factories.

&gt; you are probable part of the 2-4% richest in the world

I am easily, yes. But the view is significantly different for the US and other wealthy nations. The top 1% for net worth in the US starts at $10m, which I am not even close to. It's important to keep the worldwide perspective in mind, but what I'm complaining about was entirely centered on the country I live in.

So I would say that I'm wealthy, but I don't have the money to ""keep people down"" even if I wanted to. The uber wealthy are in another class, though. I have to be careful with my money so I can keep my company running and keep people employed. I cannot afford to spend it on lobbying, campaign contributions, or anything of that nature. My point was I am not the cause of wealth inequality any more than modern-day Americans caused WW2. They benefited from the boom, but didn't actually have anything to do with it. 

Honestly I have spent quite a lot of money helping others, so I sort of resent when people imply that I don't or wouldn't. Anyway, I am wealthy (probably moreso than the poor guy driving this car), but that doesn't mean I can change the course of US politics or reform the tax code.

The British Isles are a group of islands in the North Atlantic off the north-western coast of continental Europe that consist of the islands of Great Britain, Ireland, the Isle of Man, the Hebrides and over six thousand smaller isles. They have a total area of about 315,159 km2 and a combined population of almost 72 million, and include two sovereign states, the Republic of Ireland (which covers roughly five-sixths of Ireland), and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The islands of Alderney, Jersey, Guernsey, and Sark, and their neighbouring smaller islands, are sometimes also taken to be part of the British Isles, even though, as islands off the coast of France, they do not form part of the archipelago.The oldest rocks in the group are in the north west of Scotland, Ireland, and North Wales and are 2.7 billion years old. During the Silurian period, the north-western regions collided with the south-east, which had been part of a separate continental landmass.

&gt;By what definition would it not be? In fact, it is worse than a monopoly, because it not only is the only one allowed to provide certain services, it can force you, on pain of death, to consume those services at the price it sets. 

No righteous state is going to force people to consume services on pain of death. If there are services the government provides, it should idelly be stuff for the benefit of most/all like roads, trams, infrastructure, and so on. Stuff that literally everyone needs. Like healthcare. The government provides stuff like that so that there is no for profit organisation that tries to extract the very last penny out of people for something they need to survive. (Example Water)

&gt;Why doesn't it, except in the Nordic states, then? 

Are you saying there are no governments exept Sweeden, Finland and Norway that work? Because that is most certainly not true. While a lot of governments have problems, there are loads that work rather well.

And my point was not that monopolies only work if they are Sweedish. My point was that monopolies work if they are not for profit and democratic.

&gt;You're right! Unless by ""collective"" you mean ""a group of people working together,"" in which case that would literally describe any organization and you should have zero problem with monopolistic corporations.

By collective i meant a whole state full if people where everyone has the same amount of power (in a state that is with a ballot). Because last time I checked, there were very few collective owned organisations. Most of them were organised in a hierarchy. So yes i have zero problems with monopolistic corporations as long as everyone who is involved gets to have a say in it.

&gt;No it isn't. It's just easy for you to get confused because you're wrong but can't come to grips with that fact. Remember, you're the one who supports monopolies as long as northern Europeans are running them, not me.

I might be wrong. Who knows. That's no reason to become condescending. 

I support monopolies that are not ""for profit"" because that will always bring out the worst in people.
I support a monopoly that provides the basic needs for everyone with a safety net for those who are unable to provide for themselves so that they dont just starve. But that monopoly should be heavily regulated and collectively owned by the people / the population.

Please at least consider to try and understand the meaning behind what I write rather than just put words in my mouth and ignore my actual points. I enjoy a good discussion but not if it's more about who is right and wrong instead of where we can agree on.

I am sorry if I caused confusion, but communism as done by the USSR and China is by thier own statments and actions not communism. They are just exploiting workers as thier capitalist peers do, therefore state capitalists.

The Communist manifesto, what Communism was named after, envisioned a society where workers held the means of production and there was no capitalists or government. Think a company owned by all its workers who take collective decisions on how to run it.

It is not a practical solution as no government whould probably mean no police, army or judiciary.

So, no The USSR was not Communist. and I oversimplified.
