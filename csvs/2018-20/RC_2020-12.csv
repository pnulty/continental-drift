Por isso é sempre muito comum cair na armadilha do isolamento já que aparentemente não tem ninguém que te entenderia. 

Talvez seja só essa semana que você esteja pensando assim, se for, nem leia o resto, mas senão, continue.

O que eu gostaria de dizer, vindo de uma pessoa que lida com depressão e ansiedade, é que provavelmente você se encontra num ""espaço mental"" negativo com muita frequência. Com isso é muito comum ter esses pensamentos de que é impossível ser feliz. A realidade objetiva dos fatos é que é possível, salvo casos muito complicados. O que eu quero dizer, é que é possível que você consiga tirar a cabeça pra fora desse espaço mental negativo e passar a vislumbrar possibilidades.

É fácil, mas é difícil começar a correr atrás de por a cabeça pra fora desse poço. Primeiramente, você tem que se exercitar todos os dias, dormir e acordar em horários constantes e se alimentar bem. Como eu disse, é simples, mas exige trabalho. Faça consistentemente. Procure entrar em contato com a natureza com frequência.

Depois tem a parte que já citaram aqui. Você poderia se beneficiar de terapia. Acredito fortemente nisso. Sei que não está na realidade financeira de todos, e se for o caso pra você procure serviços gratuítos. 

Eu não sou um homem de fé, mas se você for, dê atenção a ela. Pratique gratidão. Existem estudos que mostram o quanto a prática de dizer a si mesmo, ou então a sua entidade de escolha, o quanto é grado por x, y e z, pode ter benefícios à saúde mental. Eu por exemplo, sou grato demais por não ter de pegar ônibus pra ir pros lugares, pois tenho bicicleta e moto. É bobeira, mas se eu tivesse que pegar ônibus eu ia ter meu humor destruído. 

Essas pessoas que te humilharam em um certo momento da vida eram pessoas infelizes. Não se faz isso com alguém sem que haja algo de triste dentro de si. É difícil perdoar, mas quando você entende que essa gente só estava procurando alguém que eles consideraram digno de colocar pra baixo no momento, fizeram porque existe uma insatisfação muito grande dentro deles é mais fácil deixar pra lá. 

Fazer amizade não é fácil, cara. Tem gente que diz ter se beneficiado te um certo livro de autoajuda intitulado ""como fazer amigos e influenciar pessoas"". Nunca li, acho o título brega.

No que diz respeito à idade. Você ainda é muito novo. Muita gente passa a viver plenamente nessa idade, pois finalmente conseguiram sair das garras de pais narcisistas e/ou escrotos.

Lembrando do fato de você ter relatado que achava que não merecia ser feliz como os outros por ter ido mal em certas disciplinas na faculdade, uma coisa que eu tento me lembrar quando estou sendo mau comigo mesmo: é preciso que sejamos nossos melhores amigos. A gente não fala pra um amigo que ele deve ser infeliz por ter ido mal na faculdade, por que devemos falar isso pra nós mesmos?

The EU is functionally a trade agreement with open borders.  They just share a currency.  In what way am I incorrect?  It developed from the European Economic Community, which itself came out of the the BeNeLux Countries' trade agreement post war.  I mentioned reductionism because I don't think you understand the history of Europe and why those contentions exist.  For Europe, these things are really important.  Bosnia and Herzegovina desperately wants to join, but the Republoka Srpska is holding them back.  The Bosnian Genocide is a direct result of a power vacuum cause by the lack of a ""central governing authority"".  When Bosnia happened, it was such a big deal for a place that had a genocide 50 years earlier.  Did ""never again"" actually mean anything?

&gt; Yeah, I don't think you know that much about geopolitics. Pretty much Cypress and Greece have no influence in the EU, if the other more powerful countries wanted Turkey and Ukraine to enter they have any number of instruments from which to yield leverage.

They'll leverage them economically.  But there are other concerns as well.  Again, you seem to think trade deals and everything happen in a vacuum.  They don't.  There's a lot of preceding history that goes into it.  And you don't seem to get this.  Do you think that history just ends?  Why do you think Europe is the way it is?

&gt; But that's besides the point, there's no way that cheap labor is going to be a good thing for anyone but the rich ultimately. And possibly the upper middle class. For workers, it's a losing deal.

Researching anything is quite difficult because most content produced online is made with one purpose: to have you buy something, click on an affiliate link, etc. This leads to reviews being shallow and overly positive. I do not remember reading anything insightful about Hasselblads. What helps is going to ""classic"" film forums like https://www.photo.net/ or https://photrio.com/ and using their search feature to find all threads/topics with _""Hasselblad""_ in the title. That's real people asking each other questions and troubleshooting real world problems.

You will quickly learn that:

* 500-series is indeed a much better choice than 200 or 2000 series due to better reliability and ease of servicing (and availability of spare parts). 
* 501cm models provide the best value. They're a bit newer than 500c/m and theoretically have a bit more life left in them, but they aren't as expensive as 503cw.
* Avoid C-lenses as they are too old to be serviced due to lack of parts. CFE or CFI lenses are too new/expensive, but CF are the best value.
* It is true: Hasselblad gear needs to be wound all the time, even when stored.
* When buying a body, make sure it has the Accumate-D (2nd gen) focusing screen inside, that's $400+ value if purchased separately. The part numbers are 42204 (crosshairs), 42215 (split+microprism) and 42217 (split+grid). People sell newer cameras with older screens (1st gen Accumate, or pre-Accumate) on eBay.
* Film backs are the weakest part of the system.
* Most owners will agree that a Hasselblad body + back needs a regular CLA every 2-3 years, and benefits from regular exercise.

I have gotten into this system just a few months ago and absolutely love it. About the gliding mirror (GLS) feature: my longest lens is a 150mm CF, and I see no difference in vignetting on a GLS and a non-GLS body, so I'm not sure about BravoJuliet69's comment regarding ""longer than 80mm"", maybe it meant to be ""180mm""?

I haven't erally caught up with the media through books yet but have recently started catching up on on Clone Wars and a bit on Rebels, I've only played KOTOR and the mmo, the movies of course, and The Mandalorian. I think Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni might be helping to reset the sequels with The Mandalorian and try to follow EU/Legends more with Rey being the younger sister of Ben Solo (Kylo Ren), her memories were wiped and she was also one of the students at the Jedi Temple but her memories were wiped for a reason, along with the others, Finn, and her brother, Ben Solo, one of the reason is to hide her past, Luke, her mom Leia, or someone wiping her memories and then send Rey to Jakku, but Ben and a few others were taken, most students were killed or being sold to the First Order, but Ben was taken by Snoke or some of the other higher dark side force-users because they've seen how powerful Ben Solo can become and what he's able to do for the Dark side and seduced/brain-washed him and made him join the dark side. I think one of the reasons why he joined because he felt bullied by others or for some other reason. Finn wasn't strong enough with the force so they ended up wiping his memories and making him join in as a stormtrooper for the post Galactic empire, First Order. The ship that was shown in Episode 7 sin Rey's past (looking like the Millenial Falcon) to drop her off at Jakku was for a reason. Same thing with Finn, people know he's a force-sensitive storm trooper who had a similar fate as Rey and ended up having a lot of his memories wiped and being sent to grow up later on as a First Order stormtrooper and then he has an awakening like Rey and Ben. 

Luke was scared about Kylo Ren's future and didn't see any goodness in him and attempted to kill him at his Jedi Temple because he saw that he would be tempted by Snoke? Episode 8 didn't explain why Ben would go to the dark side.  Luke was afraid of him going into the dark side. But  Ben Solo powerful enough to convince some of his students to join the Dark Side? Has Luke forgotten what he did to his father, Darth Vader, who was the most powerful Sith in the galaxy? Luke has never represented any of that, he's always represented hope and the one to rush off to help his friends. He also believed there was good in even in his father, Darth Vader (Anakin Skywalker), but not to his teenage nephew? Luke being racked with guilt that he didn’t do more to help Ben is far more plausible, or searching for something needed to stop Snoke.  Luke would never actually have the instinct to kill his own nephew because he saw his future, that in and of itself completely changed the entire direction and narrative as why Ben solo got seduced by Snoke in the first place giving his dark side name, Kylo Ren. The writing for that part in Episode 8 by Rian Johnson didn't make any sense. 

There is a theory I wanted to see Rey to fit in from some of the theories I've been seeing, and that is seeing Rey as a Solo, and she's one of the padawan students of Luke in the past, except her memories got wiped and is trying to regain it, and I think that’s why the name of Episode 7, ""The Force Awakens"", Rey discovers her power from the past and is slowly regaining it as time goes by (similar to Revan in Kotor ). I know how a lot of the lore through the games and some books I've skimmed through in Legends, and besides non-canon and legends fan fiction in Star Wars where I've read many force-users discovering their powers through time because they had their memory wiped from the past, like some in the past as a student and eventually discovers their memories as they train back. This theory would have worked out in the sequels. And there's no reason to see why Kylo Ren would say something absurd like that to her in EP 8 that she's a nobody and her parents were nobodies and junk dealers that tried to trade/smuggle her for drinking/gambling money. Then the course of episode 9 was significantly changed and in Rey's backstory  when Abrams decided to go with the fan theory of her being a descendant of Palpatine. Are you kidding me?

I think it's rather a silly method. I think Kylo Ren is just lying to her about her past, which is  similar to the quotes in the movie and the trailers we heard him say, “Let the past die, kill it if you must. It's the only way to become what you were meant to be” which makes sense, he really wants to forget the past that he destroyed of himself. And he even said that he knows her [https://youtu.be/db9NsZJjcNs?t=9](https://youtu.be/db9NsZJjcNs?t=9) he even said she’s some ancient Jedi master or something, but this is coming from BF2 so I don’t think it really matters since it’s not canon apparently. They were trying to come up with something here and I guess the directors or people in charge of the writing didn't catch up with this.

So if Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni are trying to reset the sequel series to making it into-non canon, the Mandalorian is just one step in the right direction, hopefully trying to remake the sequels even though Carrie Fischer passed away, we can get a CG actress for her. I still think the death of Han Solo, Luke, and even Leia could've been done a lot better so it wouldn't be like what we've seen in the sequel.

Ish.  Simultaneously, they have regulators regulating against other regulators.

Now, citizenship alone does not solve anything, given the current state of Turkey, the government must guarantee equal rights, language rights, religious neutrality, etc. The genocide should be included in the educational curriculum (teach the good and bad of our shared history, understanding the role that both cristian and muslim, convert, Armenians and others played in the Empire), the heritage must be taken care of, this means monuments, churches, monasteries, and so that are current in bad state or were improperly repurposed must be dedicated as museums at least. Maybe also adopting a more neutral, less islamic flag?

Also, it could be implemented some kind of tax advantages, like the US and Canada do with their native population. Turkey will also benefit of attracting Armenians to their land (decreasing Kurdish nationalism for example).

I’m the HOH of a new FH called A Sprinkle of Style. Currently we have 8 members so obviously we need more!

We’re a fun friendly house, willing to chat and give advice, who want to win prizes. We plan to rally fancy most of the time, with a couple of fierce rallies each month to secure the four grand bags!

Rules:

1. House members must play half the rallies each month - so it’s possible to toggle on for 5, and toggle off for 5

2. If toggled on and participating in a rally, daily challenges and $100 challenges are required

$200 challenges and FBs are not required but a willingness to play them sometimes (eg during fierce rallies) would be great ☺️ 

If you miss a required challenge please just let us know. We know that life gets in the way sometimes, so if you’re ill or have a family emergency etc we’ll understand. I fell asleep before submitting a challenge lately - luckily it wasn’t a rally challenge! But we understand that accidents happen and don’t hold it against anyone unless it happens consistently.

If you accidentally miss a req challenge during a fierce rally, you’ll probably be removed temporarily, but you can request to rejoin the house. This is simply because fierce rallies have higher targets so are harder to reach and we’re unlikely to do so unless everyone enters. 

And if you continually miss entering required challenges while toggled on, then you run the risk of removal from the house. We don’t want to be too harsh but it’s unfair on everyone else in the house if somebody continually breaks the rules. 

It's a private house and our filters are English, and European.

You have to take the precautions. Theres a reasom shooting sports are one of the safest sports even in school clubs.

You cant drive drunk without a seatbelt without consequences. If your not mature enough to drive safely you should not drive.

Anyone stupid enough to leave a loaded firearm in the open is a self solving problem.

There are safety rules for firearms.

Always assume every gun is loaded. Keep pointed in a safe direction. Don't point at anything you dont intend to shoot. 

Etc etc

Ive been handling guns since i was 5. There are kids that shot their first deer before they turned 10.

You have to take the precautions. It is your choice. If you feel you are not mature enough to own firearms then do not buy one.

3 million crimes are stopped by firearms every year according to the CDC. 

Thats a pretty good benefit.

Out of all gun crime. About 4k murders happen. About 30kish die a year by guns. Most of them suicide.

That is part of risk. Everything you do has risk.

You drive you can die even if your the best goddamn driver on earth. All the mechanical safety features in modern cars. You can still die. Or be severely injured.
Because of a drunk driver. Who kills more a year than firearms.

If mom let little timmy handle a loaded firearm outside a gun range. That's her fault. Yes. It is her fault.

Theres an old video on YouTube of someone allowing a kid handle an full auto Uzi at the range. A machine gun rental. For some reason they allowed the kid to handle it. Rather than thinking logically. The kid couldn't handle the recoil and it blew the head off the guy assisting her.

You cant give someone the keys to a car without training. You negate most risk with training. Machine guns arent legal for most us citizens to own unfortunately. Pre 86 is the only choice and they are expensive. 

Ofc 3d printing has allowed groups who could formerly not own firearms do so. Even a European owning a semi auto FGL 9mm carbine. Made his own ammo. All that

Guns have a purpose. Fun is one. Defense is another and hunting. For some like me. We also like collecting. Firearms are apart of our history and culture. To tell us to get rid of them is like walking into a mosque and telling folks to stop wearing hijab. 

You may not understand and i don't expect you to. But this is the way.

And with our goverment going the way it is. Why would i not want to be armed?

I believe that psychosis is more likely when you smoke concentrates because it tends to have less CBD. I believe CBD prevents THC psychosis. this is why synthetic cannabinoids are so bad and often lead to psychotic states, since they usually have no cbd in it.

THC = partial receptor agonist, usually with at least some CBD in its mixture. 

Synthetic cannabinoids= full agonist, with no CBD combined. 

The link between THC and CBD is important. Smoking concentrates is slowly becoming more common in america, and I think soon it'll be more easier to link psychosis to thc.

Secondly, Check Netherlands data.

Holownia its the only one that **really** stays in the center

PiS its like GA14 candidate

KO.. has their problems (portrayed as if they were AOC)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

There are still complaints that the opposition is doing nothing, but that is not the problem. The opposition is doing a painstaking job in parliament, but there is no leader who could tell Poles about it. The expressive Marta Lempart and Szymon Hołownia draw more attention than the leaders of the parliamentary opposition. How are they going to win against PiS?

&amp;#x200B;

The United Right is going through the worst crisis since 2015. The politicians of the ruling coalition are not coping with the pandemic, are unable to get along with each other, and have opened two dangerous fronts: on abortion and the EU budget. Both go beyond the traditional divisions between Poland and the PO-PiS, mobilizing the wider electorate against the rulers. Despite the pandemic, thousands of Polish women dissatisfied with the ruling of the Tribunal by Julia Przyłębska take to the streets, and in a moment they may be joined by citizens who are concerned that PiS wants to move Poland out of the EU . Even the overwhelming majority of the PiS electorate is against the polexit. Zbigniew Ziobro is heating up the dispute over the new EU budgethoping that this would attract the most radical right-wing choices to his Solidarity Poland. Jarosław Kaczyński, who was once considered a genius strategist, cannot tame Ziobro.

&amp;#x200B;

It would seem that the crisis of the ruling team should benefit the largest opposition group, a natural contender to take power. However, subsequent polls show that support for PiS is falling, but the bars of the Civic Coalition are not growing. It's even worse - support for KO has slightly decreased since the 2019 elections. In the latest Ipsos survey for [OKO.press](https://OKO.press), in which PiS recorded only 29 percent, Koalicja Obywatelska - 23 percent. This is four percentage points less than KO received in the last parliamentary elections (27.4 percent). The Left, which in the Ipsos poll showed support at the level of 10 percent, is not gaining either, which means that its slogans about liberalizing the anti-abortion law do not arouse great enthusiasm. The Confederation (9%) and PSL-Kukiz'15 (4%) are not growing either.

&amp;#x200B;

Szymon Hołownia's Poland 2050 is the only grouping whose support is growing on the opposition side. And this despite the fact that the party has no club or circle in the Seym. He has only one MP, Hanna Gill-Piątek, who escaped from the Lewica club. However, if the elections were held today, Poland by 2050 could count - according to Ipsos - on as much as 20 percent of support (an increase by 10 percentage points). This is only 3 percentage points less than KO!

&amp;#x200B;

This result shows that Poles are tired of the parliamentary opposition and want something new. This is bad news for KO, because PiS alone is unlikely to win. And it is not because he is doing nothing or screaming in a loud voice that PiS is destroying and stealing Poland, as the voters on the liberal-democratic side are used to complaining. The opposition does painstaking work on a daily basis. If it were not for KO MPs Michał Szczerba and Dariusz Joński, the public would not have learned about the scams when buying protective equipment needed to fight the coronavirus pandemic. On the occasion of covid bills, the opposition tabled many important amendments, not counting other bills that PiS ritually rejects.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem, however, is that the opposition still does not have its own story about Poland or a leader who would be able to reach the emotions of Poles. I regret that, but elections are still being won by emotions, and perhaps even more so, given the populist march in Europe that will hopefully stop Joe Biden's win in the US.

&amp;#x200B;

There is no such leader who would be able to speak to the hearts of Poles, neither in the KO, nor in the Left, nor in the Confederation or the PSL. It did not turn out to be the new PO chairman, Borys Budka, who is a great lawyer and hard-working politician, but he does not captivate the crowds. Włodzimierz Czarzasty, Robert Biedroń and Adrian Zandberg, who was supposed to be the hope of the Left, but has disappeared somewhere, are not such leaders either. Today, the expressive Marta Lempart, the leader of the Polish Women's Strike, draws more attention than the leaders of the parliamentary opposition. Many are indignant at its harsh language, but since we have an exceptional situation in Poland - as the opposition has been arguing for five years - then the language must be adequate to the situation. Polls show that the opposition can win against PiS, but a wider coalition would have to be formed - e.g. KO,

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps voters see hope in Szymon Hołownia, although one poll is not enough to draw far-reaching conclusions. The advantage of Hołownia is freshness, he was not in charge yet, so he did not have to make difficult decisions that would burden him. Hołownia is a showman and a good speaker.

1. The verb *to be* - important to learn, especially in languages where it differs from English (*ser* means something different to *estar*, *shì* means something different to *zài*). Without learning these you will lose some of the meaning of the sentence - what, for example, is the difference between *Juan es listo* and *Juan está listo*? The verbs both translate to English as forms of *to be* but the meaning of the sentence is quite different. This is a basic thing.

2. Numerals. Many exchanges of information involve this: what is your phone number? How much does that shirt cost? And so on. The value of the numbers is absolutely vital for a successful exchange of this basic information, and thus forms part of the foundation.

3. Greetings and goodbyes. These are not obvious. For one thing, if a Dane says *hej* to you - which sounds like an English *hi* - there's a fairly good chance it's a farewell, especially if they say it twice in a row. Secondly, while a lot of European greetings might seem obvious, that's largely through either similarity or exposure imo. Most of us have probably heard *ni hao* before, but how many would recognise *zai jian*?

4. Basic colours are maybe 5-10 words, so not massively difficult to learn, and can be extremely helpful since people use colour to distinguish objects a lot.

5. Names of animals/plants/countries - ok, I agree with you on plants, but basic animals, especially those likely to be kept as pets or which have cultural significance, are definitely foundation words. As are the country/ies where the target language is spoken, the learner's home country, and a couple other major countries (the USA fits into this last category for me, for example).

OP, it's a very random question during a lockdown, but if you're going to mention Japan, why did you immediately volley the question to her again? There's no space to even ask a question here in return. If you wanted to talk about travel, that's totally fine, but you're going to have to do something more than giving your own one-word answers in response to the question you just asked. That's just poor conversation skills coming back to bite you.

In that example, I might mention that I miss traveling and that I wanted to go to Japan to visit my brother who is stationed out there, or because the last time I went to Japan I had an incredible time in Tokyo, or I want to go during the cherry blossom festival, or I've been learning Japanese in anticipation of going... Maybe I'll just talk about traveling in general, anything! Notice that it's not a question, it's a statement with enough detail to generate questions that she can now ask if she's interested. You have to give her something to respond to. 

""I want to go to Japan, where do you want to go?"" Is too pointed of a question, so not only have you not given her anything to discuss based on what you previously just brought up as the topic, but you are also now inviting her to change the (sub)topic from Japan to wherever she wants to travel (or worse: you get the dreaded ""me too!""). She's going to answer the question you gave her.. now you have to pull teeth to get more information. She wasn't prepared to talk about Europe, you're the one that brought up travel and it's not fair to assume she should be ready to entertain you in the topic of your choosing.

The reason why I bring this cultural difference up is that taxpayer-funded Medicare isn't just healthcare with price ceilings and a national registry of prices, it means that when you get sick, eat junk food, neglect your body etc, you aren't just your own burden, but you are the burden of an entire society.

You forgot about Stalin and that he was a mass murderer, didn't you?

Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union when Crimea was gifted to them. In 2014 however Crimea was part of Ukraine, an independent country. Putin tried to wheel his influence there by installing his puppet Victor Yanucovych (remember him, he is wanted for high treason in Ukraine) Yanucoych's rival Yushchenko was poisoned with dioxin in 2004 btw, remember. Ukraine had gradually started talks with the EU and NATO about becoming a member, something Putin really didn't want because the eastern Ukrainian border is just 400 km distance from Moscow and he didn't want to lose another ex SU country. 

Victor Yanucovych tried to change certain laws and constitutions to prevent Ukraine's western shift. Two US brokers, Paul Manaford, remember him, and Tad Devine (he was Bernie's campaign chairman in 2016 were lobbying for Victor Yanucovych. 

Both of Bernie's campaigns were boosted with dirty Russian oligarch money. He also voted against the Magnitsky act and several times against sanctions on Russia.

When Ukrainians got wind of the scheming they took to the streets during the Euromaidan protests and ousted Yanucovych who fled the country and to Moscow.

That's when Putin decided to march his troops into Crimean and Donbass and Obama started to sanction Russia.

In the Darth Plagueis novel, Sidious all but says all the plans for the Clone Wars were his that he fed to Plagueis to give back to him. How much of that you believe may vary, but Plagueis did seem to withdraw from the galaxy, so it does make sense. Plagueis had the general idea, but he would have lacked the ability to control the war without Palpatine as Chancellor. 

That could go one of two ways to me. The most likely path would be Plagueis just letting things play out without the final step of actually killing the Jedi. He would use the war to erode public confidence in the Jedi, but since he doesn’t have a direct role, he can’t capitalize on it. So the grand plan gets delayed for another Sith down the line. 

The other option is with Plagueis actively controlling the Separatists. He pretty clearly had influence with the beings who would become the Separatist Council. Plagueis could have tried to actively help the Separatist win and maybe lead them from the shadows. Though, again, without the inside information Palpatine would have had access to. I guess it would depend if he thought he could take over through force or not.

In February 2008, China and Russia together submitted a draft to the UN known as the Treaty on Prevention of the Placement of Weapons in Outer Space and of the Threat or Use of Force against Outer Space Objects (PPWT).[12][13] The US opposed the draft treaty due to security concerns over its space assets despite the treaty explicitly affirming a State's inherent right of self-defence.[14]

On December 4, 2014, the General Assembly of the UN passed two resolutions on preventing an arms race in outer space:[15]

The first resolution, Prevention of an arms race in outer space, ""call[s] on all States, in particular those with major space capabilities, to contribute actively to the peaceful use of outer space, prevent an arms race there, and refrain from actions contrary to that objective.""[15] There were 178 countries that voted in favour to none against, with 2 abstentions (Israel, United States).[15]
The second resolution, No first placement of weapons in outer space, emphasises the prevention of an arms race in space and states that ""other measures could contribute to ensuring that weapons were not placed in outer space.""[15] 126 countries voted in favour to 4 against (Georgia, Israel, Ukraine, United States), with 46 abstentions (EU member States abstained on the resolution).[15]
The Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space (PAROS) is a committee subsidiary to the Conference on Disarmament.

""In 391 CE, as part of his attempt to wipe out paganism, Emperor Theodosius I officially sanctioned the destruction of the Serapeum, or Temple of Serapis at Alexandria. The destruction of the Temple was carried out under Theophilus, Bishop of Alexandria, and afterwards a Christian church was built on the site. It has been hypothesised that the daughter library of the Museum, located close to the Temple, and the Royal Library were also razed to the ground at this time. However, whilst it is plausible that manuscripts from the Serapeum library may have been destroyed during this purge, there is no evidence that the Royal Library still existed at the end the 4th century. No ancient sources mention the destruction of any library at this time, though 18th century English historian Edward Gibbon mistakenly attributes it to bishop Theophilus.""

[],,Alexander_the_Drake,1456733389.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_vxey3,False,False,[],"For **Jo Nesbø** as far as recommended starting points goes:
  
- _Headhunters_, a standalone darkly comedic crime thriller, is pretty good and a nice place to start if you want some humour and don't want to commit to an entire series all at once. It's my personal favourite of his, in part due to also having an excellent film adaptation that was praised by the late Roger Ebert.

- for his Harry Hole police thriller series, if you want to read the books actually set in Norway, start with the 3rd novel, _The Redbreast_, which is the beginning of the Oslo Trilogy arc. The first two novels take place as solo adventures overseas and aren't very representative of the later tone and style and are missing his supporting cast. (Also IMHO the writing quality in them is noticeably inferior.) Another decent jumping-on point later in the series is _The Snowman_, 7th novel, which happens after a bunch of character arcs have been wrapped up, and start a new set. It's also got a film adaptation, but apparently not a good one.

- personally, I was underwhelmed by his Olav Johansen duology starting with _Blood on Snow_, but it's got a different, more casual and lower-key style than Harry Hole if you'd prefer that instead

- I didn't care at all for _The Son_, which was explicitly a crime Christ allegory, but YMMV if you think you might be interested in that kind of thing. Similarly, he's also got a _Macbeth_ retelling, and there's also a new standalone, _The Kingdom_, which is supposed to be in a different style from his other previous work.

For other Norwegian authors, I've also read and would recommend:

**Jørn Lier Horst**'s William Wisting police procedural series set in the coastal town of Larvik is quite good and has won the Riverton and Petrona Awards. They're low-key procedural realism (Horst was a police officer himself) and have a good variety of different and sometimes unusual cases.

Everything from the 6th book, _Dregs_ (inspired by the real life mystery of British Columbia's washed up feet), onwards (the rest remain untranslated) is available from some combination of Sandstone Press, Penguin UK, and Macmillan in the US. The Sandstone editions have a handy recap of previous major developments (no whodunnit spoilers), so if you like, you can safely start with the two award-winning books, which ISTR are _The Hunting Dogs_ and _The Caveman_.

**Thomas Enger**'s Henning Juul quintet, starring a crime reporter returning to work after a personal tragedy (Enger himself is a journalist), and seeking evidence against the suspected criminal culprits behind it as an overarching storyarc backgrounding the individual cases. These lean sensationalist thriller-ish and the plot developments can be kind of contrived, but they're also delightfully cynical about media absurdity and the 24-hour news cycle if you like that kind of thing. It's also a complete series with a definite end, if that's a bonus. Between them, Orenda, Faber &amp; Faber, and Simon &amp; Schuster have all the books in English translation.

Enger also has a standalone I haven't read, and the Blix &amp; Ramm collaboration series with Jørn Lier Horst (they're apparently IRL friends and have their characters guest cameo in each others' books) which teams up a cop with a blogger.

**Gard Sveen** is a more recent author, but has already gotten a bunch of prizes for his debut novel, _The Last Pilgrim_, which I quite liked. IMHO, he reads pretty Nesbø-ish, with a Harry Hole-like police detective. The first case is an interesting mix of crime in the past related to crime in the present, if you like that kind of dual discovery storyline. AmazonCrossing has been translating his work, but it looks like they're not getting past the 2nd novel, which kind of has a semi-cliffhanger for some of the loose threads, just so you're warned.

I've also read a couple of works by Kjell Ola Dahl and Anne Holt which seemed fairly well done, but IMHO, haven't tried enough of their stuff to evaluate and recommend them overall. But they've both got pretty good reputations and Holt has the nickname “Queen of Norwegian Crime”.

If you'd like to try Norway-set mystery/thrillers written by foreigners, I've read and liked:

- **Robert Barnard**'s _Death in a Cold Climate_ (a standalone with a local policeman investigating the death of a foreigner in Tromsø) and _The Cherry Blossom Corpse_ (a series Scotland Yard detective on vacation with his sister at a romance novelist's conference which turns murderous), which were fairly good, in a kind of sober British procedural and mildly comedic cozy mystery style, respectively. Barnard has a Diamond Dagger Award for lifetime achievement from one of the crime writer's associations.

- **Katherine Hall Page**'s _The Body in the Fjord_, part of Faith Fairchild cozy mystery series starring a caterer and pastor's wife. This is a working vacation case with a supporting character investigating an old family friend's relative's death, and ISTR incorporated a nice use of Norwegian history. TBH, the rest of her series kind of grates on me because she recycles a certain core whodunnit motivation so much whether or not it really fits, but this is a pretty good installment to read standalone.

- **James R. Benn**'s _Billy Boyle_, 1st in an eponymous WWII-set mystery/crime/espionage thriller series, starring a young Boston cop who's a staffer for General Eisenhower, and taking care of cases all across the European theatre. This one involves Norwegian concerns and some of it takes place in Norway, as there are suspicions of a spy amongst the Norwegian government in exile as an invasion upon a strategic part of the country is planned. These are really quite good, and were one of my favourite series, though I haven't kept up with the later volumes.

For the other Nordic countries, I'll recommend the following anthologies as having a good sampler selection of short stories by local authors whose longer works you might want to look for:

However, I'm going to play devil's advocate for a moment.

1) There hadn't been a Blight in 400 years and it doesn't seem like records were exactly well-kept in terms of what a Blight entails. Especially since the Wardens are especially secretive of what their deal is, and also because Fereldan had changed hands a few times in the last few decades.

2) The Wardens could be seen as helping Orlesians get a foothold back in Fereldan, because they supported letting in Orlesian troops as well as the Orlesian Wardens. (FWIW though Duncan ALSO supported letting the Redcliffe troops come to support them at Ostagar, and it was Cailan who shut that down. However, Cailan was probably making his tactical decisions based on what Loghain told him. So.... well, I digress.)

I can actually follow Loghain's logic and I don't actually think it was THAT ridiculous. Putting it in modern terms, if someone told me that 400 years ago that the bubonic plague ravaged Europe and the only solution back then was basically to drink a lot of booze and hope for the best so that's exactly what we should do with COVID-19, I would say, ""Well, dude, it's 2020 and we have modern medicine, so why don't we socially distance, wear masks and wait for a vaccine?"" 

And then if I was a person in power who had reason to believe a foreign power would take advantage of this to destabilize my country, then I might make some sacrifices to maneuver myself into a better position to later face them.

So I don't actually think it was ever about whether Duncan actually believed there was a Blight or not. Most people have no clue why Wardens are needed at all other than that they fight darkspawn regularly. 

It's not unreasonable for Loghain to believe that they could defeat a darkspawn horde or an Archdemon with contemporary technology/magic. The horde wasn't the enemy to him. The enemy was Cailan and Orlais. The Wardens were just a tool being used by Orlais, so he had no issue framing them as the culprits. Meanwhile he had all his little pawns in play, with Howe killing off the Couslands, Jowan poisoning Eamon and Uldred setting off a revolution at the Circle, getting all his ducks lined up in a row. 

Like, if the Archdemon wasn't actually a big deal and it wasn't actually a Blight, he would have had a pretty good plan. Or if you didn't ACTUALLY need Wardens to kill the Archdemon, he might still have had it under control if he'd started prioritizing the darkspawn earlier. Too bad for everyone he was wrong.",True,False,False,,,,0,1606807952,,False,0,{},ge8mrqq,False,t3_k447ss,False,False,t1_ge86jqj,/r/dragonage/comments/k447ss/spoilers_all_loghain/ge8mrqq/,False,,1618049951,8,True,False,dragonage,t5_2r8lo,r/dragonage,public,,0,[],

Or your fault. Or my fault. Always someone else.

We always know better than someone else, we always know what is going behind the curtains (z3ama) and what the real intentions are (z3aaaaaama).

TOZ
-French has held us back but french has also advanced us
-French is a useful language but not in all situations.
-Z3ama you want to be modern and learn English while in many other countries people are looking at Chinese as the language of the future
-There are Moroccans all over the world, you cannot find 1 teacher who can learn you another language in your own time? No duolingo too?
-There are consequences for almost everything if such a change would take place, Morocco 2020 is not comparable to Devleti Aliye in 1920 nor Turkey in 1928.
-You think there is no bullshit like our bullshit abroad? It's everywhere and some things are worse.
-Too much to reply

No one shits over his own country and his own people like Mgharba. 
Either it's for Amazigh culture or status, or it's against the king, or about ""democracy"",  or about religion, about work, about corruption,..
And then you decide to move to europe one day and you hate it there more than in Morocco.
But of course you can't admit that because that would be the same as admitting that you are wrong or have failed and you can't do that. So you shit some more all over your country while being in europe and at the same time missing and ""loving"" your country.

We have good things and we have bad things. But things keep changing. I'm married to an Algerian woman, i have heard a lot of things that are unimaginable in Morocco. In Belgium there is corruption and tax fraud eeeeverywhere, there was a government no one elected and the government currently is run by a bunch of small political parties who banded together because they refuse to give power to the biggest parties (plural!) their own people voted for.

Point is that they openly say democracy is a failed concept and that we don't do western democracy yada yada. There's no plus points to this. The point is that there are no delusions.

Mind you, by no means do I agree with either country. I'm as liberal as they come.

It isn't earning you points but the point I'm making here is, we live in the AUSes, USAs, UKs, Canadas, EUs and Indias of the world. These are the macro democracies afaik. Maybe Brazil too. Each and every one of these countries claims a moral high ground on the two previously mentioned authoritarian nations as ""we have freedom and democracy"" which is true. We can do a 100 things in our lives those people will never be able to do (and that's a wide spectrum of democracies I've given as examples there if you notice. Life in Brazil and India is nothing like the West).

But our countries do hyper authoritarian shit like this and we respond with ""uhh what about China and Russia"", like what? 

At least the Chinese and Russians know where they live, there are no delusions. We don't really do anything to criticise or challenge the authoritarianism in our nations. And no getting rid of Trump means very little really. America is still on the slippery slope, it's just not rolling as fast.

The fact that you lot are so fearful of what I'm suggesting, about our own biases, shows me why countries like Russia are able to fuck with our democracies. This is why you're seeing such a crazy right shift. Because the authoritarianism under the scenes in our democracies isn't being challenged.

Já muitos outros comentários aconselharam acompanhamento psicológico. Como enfermeira, eu aconselho uma visita ao psiquiatra. Essa apatia, ansiedade social e falta de direção são sintomas de depressão e podem ser tratados. Eu passei pelo mesmo (tentativa de suicídio inclusive) e ainda estou a ser acompanhada. O psiquiatra pode depois encaminhar-te para terapia cognitivo-comportamental, que te vai ajudar a superar a ansiedade e ensinar-te estratégias para encarar as dificuldades que aparecerem.

Não é fácil hoje em dia arranjar emprego numa área que gostes sem curso, seja ele um curso técnico ou uma licenciatura. Mas só porque ainda não o fizeste, não significa que é tarde demais. Nunca é tarde para aprender. A questão da falta de dinheiro é mais complicada, mas como disseste, não tens grandes gastos. O meu conselho aqui é pores em ordem a tua saúde mental e depois, quando te sentires com mais confiança, avançares com aquilo que realmente queres.

Quanto à tua mãe, é uma situação delicada. É a tua mãe e tu queres o melhor para ela, mas também tens de pensar no que é melhor para ti. Puseste a tua vida praticamente em pausa para cuidar dela, o que é comendável, mas não necessariamente saudável para um jovem da tua idade. Há recursos que podem ajudar. Na tua área, procura um centro de saúde com uma UCCI (unidade de cuidados continuados integrados). Eles vão a tua casa, avaliam a situação da tua mãe, e dão-te alternativas. Atenção: Não tem necessariamente de ser um lar. Se ela tiver condições, pode receber cuidados de enfermagem no domicílio.

Um conselho de quem já passou pelo que estás a passar: nunca desistas de ti. Vai sempre haver dias mais em que não queres sair da cama ou do quarto por nada, mas faz o esforço -  à medida que o tempo passa, esses dias tornam-se mais raros.

One of the soccer apps has an in-app ratings feature and he's tied with VVD at a rating of ""90/100"", i.e the top CB in the app.

The other day some pundits on the radio mentioned him as one of the top defenders.

He was trending in social media not so long ago (although that might be biased, because I follow a bunch of Bayern accounts, so maybe it's just tailored for me).

Many mentions of him in r/soccer.

Just a few examples of what I've been seeing that made me think that people might possibly rate him at the top.

This isn't me arguing that he is the top in the world, but rather his public perception. And I really don't think that it's because their teams aren't doing well.

Like, Pique not being mentioned shouldn't only be justified by Barcelona's bad form.

We've seen the likes of Godin and Koulibaly put their names out there even when their teams struggle. So I do think that individual quality counts and would still get them enough exposure.

That said; does the world think that Alaba is the top defender in the world? Top 5 maybe? For what reasons?

Eu tentei encontrar um post pra te passar, onde explico o meu username, mas o [pusshfit.io](https://search.pushshift.io/reddit/) tá emperrado, sem mostrar resultados.

E ok, ""babaca"" é uma das traduções, mas se afasta um pouco do contexto que eu quis dar. Se você pegar os refrões de ""Another Brick in the Wall"", do Pink Floyd, tem lá…

 

&gt;All in all it's just another brick in the wall

 

&gt;All in all you´re just another brick in the wall

 

&gt;All in all it was all just bricks in the wall 

 

&gt;All in all you were just bricks in the wall

 

Quando eu entrei no Reddit, tentei escolher o ""brick"" da música, mas já existia.

""Prick"" caía bem, pois a gente não deixa de se sentir um idiota (prick), quando percebemos que estamos enfiados lá, na parede, presos, robotizados, massificados, iguaizinhos a qualquer outro tijolo que se encontra por lá, como mostra o clip da música.

 

A mensagem que há por trás do username é de você lutar pra conseguir se livrar da ""parede"" e buscar o seu próprio destino, tentando entender por sua conta o que realmente se passa no mundo ao seu redor, e não aceitar com apatia o que a cultura de massa tenta enfiar na sua cabeça, forçando todos a pensar e agir de maneira uniforme (like ""bricks in the wall"").

 

Eu te perguntei mais, porque como ""prick"" tem vários sentidos, o teu comentário pareceu ambíguo, poderia ser zoeira ou aprovação, saca?

Você ganhou o meu respeito. 🙏 Obrigado pelo elogio \*blushes\* 😊.

**L'ARTICLE:**

**En Grèce, dans les cendres du camp de réfugiés rasé par les flammes en septembre, nous avons retrouvé le journal de bord tenu, depuis l’intérieur de la « zone mineurs », par les éducateurs de l’OIM, organisation affiliée à l’ONU. Toute la violence dans laquelle ces enfants étaient plongés s’y retrouve consignée. Un document exclusif.**


Il fait froid, ce matin du 18 novembre 2018, sur l’île de Lesbos, en Grèce. Moria, l’immense camp de réfugiés et ses presque 5 000 nouveaux arrivants, se réveille les pieds dans la boue, sous les tentes dégoulinantes de pluie. Fanis*, éducateur de l’Organisation internationale pour les migrations (OIM), une agence affiliée à l’ONU, pénètre dans la « zone sécurisée », l’espace barbelé réservé aux mineurs isolés. Le travailleur social pousse la porte de la réserve et découvre un rat mort dans une caisse à mandarines. Ce n’est pas la première fois que la vermine s’introduit dans les grands conteneurs qui servent de lieux de vie, mais le professionnel persiste à noter la même phrase sur le journal de bord : « Grave problème avec les rats et danger de transmission de maladies aux bénéficiaires ainsi qu’au personnel. »



Fanis n’est pas au bout de ses peines. Pendant la nuit, les pluies diluviennes ont inondé la salle où se trouvent le frigidaire et le chauffage. L’éducateur reprend donc sa plume pour conseiller à ses collègues de porter de « hautes bottes en plastique » afin d’éviter l’électrocution. Pire : le conteneur numéro 5, où dort une partie des enfants, est aussi détrempé. Les petits courent un danger mortel : « Risque d’électrocution », note encore le travailleur social, avant de refermer l’épais journal cartonné.

Avant les incendies du 8 septembre 2020 qui l’ont rasé, Moria était considéré par les ONG comme le « pire » camp de réfugiés d’Europe. Au moment des feux, 12 500 personnes s’entassaient dans la crasse et la misère d’un camp bâti pour 3 100. Parmi eux, entre 300 et 600 mineurs isolés, qui vivaient dans la « zone sécurisée », un espace où ils étaient enfermés pendant la nuit pour leur protection.

C’est l’OIM, organisation affiliée à l’ONU chargée de promouvoir des migrations « ordonnées » mais surtout connue pour organiser des retours vers les pays d’origine, qui avait été choisie pour la coordination de cet endroit sensible. Avec pour mission d’accompagner les jeunes, qui patientaient des mois avant d’être transférés vers la Grèce continentale ou les pays de l’UE.

L’OIM avait donc embauché éducateurs, psychologues, avocats, infirmières et interprètes, nous écrit-elle, afin de « couvrir tous les besoins des enfants ». À savoir : Fanis et ses collègues, les contributeurs du document que nous avons retrouvé dans les cendres de Moria.



Nous sommes une semaine après les incendies, le 16 septembre 2020. La mer de tentes multicolores s’est muée en un paysage de suie à perte de vue. Structures de tentes calcinées, jouets cassés, ustensiles de cuisines éparpillés sur une terre devenue pelée et déserte. C’est là, dans un coin appelé « la jungle », à même le sol, entre deux barquettes de riz avec le logo de l’UE, que nous l’avons trouvé. Le manuscrit avait survécu aux flammes et aux pilleurs, qui ne l’avaient pas jugé digne d’intérêt.

« Zone sécurisée », annonce d’emblée sa couverture. Sur la page de garde, le code wi-fi réservé aux employés de l’OIM. Puis, page après page, dans un grec discipliné, les travailleurs de l’agence ont scrupuleusement noté tous les événements qui ont eu lieu pendant leur tour de garde. Du nombre de croissants aux litres de jus consommés par les « bénéficiaires » en passant par les traitements médicaux avalés. Aussi : les bagarres, les fugues, les dangers courus et les violences subies par les plus vulnérables des résidents de Moria.

Le document manuscrit de 190 pages couvre une période d’environ six mois, de novembre 2018 à mai 2019. Le jour de la dernière note, le 8 mai, Moria compte déjà 2 000 habitants au-dessus de ses capacités. Mais ce n’est que le début de l’escalade. À la fin de l’année, ce sera l’explosion : le nombre des personnes aura quasiment quadruplé (19 256 en janvier 2020). À la lecture du calepin, on se demande pourtant comment la situation a pu encore empirer.

**Nuit noire**

Page après page, on s’aperçoit que les coupures d’électricité – causées notamment par les pluies – représentent un problème majeur pour la petite communauté. Ces interruptions, qui peuvent durer plusieurs jours, empêchent le personnel de surveiller les entrées et sorties. Une catastrophe pour la sécurité des enfants censés être à l’abri des agressions. Le 24 novembre 2018, après plusieurs jours sans courant, au désespoir, Fanis et ses collègues Giannis* et Maria* rouvrent le carnet de bord :

« L’inertie des personnes chargées de l’entretien fait qu’une fois encore nous sommes privés d’électricité, au point de n’avoir pas une seule lumière à l’intérieur et l’extérieur de la zone sécurisée. Tous les jours ou presque nous sommes contraints d’apporter des lampes-torches de chez nous pour essayer de voir, dans le noir complet, qui saute par-dessus les barbelés. Pour pénétrer à l’intérieur ou pour en sortir. Ces conditions de vie sont inacceptables ! En dépit des plaintes répétées des travailleurs sociaux, la situation ne semble pas s’améliorer. »
Extrait : « Le conteneur n° 8 est inondé. Il coule de l’eau à l’intérieur et dans de nombreux endroits. Ce serait bien que les bénéficiaires soient déplacés vers d'autres conteneurs jusqu’à ce que le temps s’améliore. Danger d’électrocution. Le phénomène a également été noté dans d’autres conteneurs mais à plus petite échelle. » Extrait : « Le conteneur n° 8 est inondé. Il coule de l’eau à l’intérieur et dans de nombreux endroits. Ce serait bien que les bénéficiaires soient déplacés vers d'autres conteneurs jusqu’à ce que le temps s’améliore. Danger d’électrocution. Le phénomène a également été noté dans d’autres conteneurs mais à plus petite échelle. »

**Une triste note de Noël**

« JOYEUX NOËL !!! » Pour marquer l’événement, l’éducateur de garde a dessiné de jolies lettres au sommet de la page du 25 décembre 2018. Mais rien n’est jamais joyeux à Moria. S., une adolescente, vient de faire passer un morceau de papier à l’assistante sociale : le nom de son agresseur. Les éducateurs copient l’information avec un crayon de bois, entre autres notes au stylo bleu : « Il l’a battue en dehors de la zone sécurisée alors qu’il était ivre », lit-on. « Nous avons appelé la police, l’officier a envoyé une patrouille à pied. Voyons ce qui va se passer. » Le ton résigné employé par Fannis et son collègue semble indiquer qu’ils ne se font pas d’illusions.
La page du 25 décembre 2018. La page du 25 décembre 2018.

Les travailleurs sociaux reportent qu’un homme est déjà venu se plaindre de S. auparavant. Un peu plus tôt dans la journée, ce dernier s’est présenté à l’entrée. Tonitruant, il avait accusé S. de lui avoir volé de l’argent. Il prétendait lui en avoir déjà donné à plusieurs reprises « en échange de choses qui ne peuvent être décrites ». Les employés de l’OIM lui avaient demandé de partir en lui indiquant que, si quelqu’un lui avait volé de l’argent, il devait s’en plaindre à la police et que la violence n’avait pas sa place ici. « L’homme est parti satisfait… », avait noté le personnel en service.

Interrogé sur les suites données à cette affaire, l’OIM nous fait cette réponse générale : « Un soutien psychologique était proposé aux enfants, afin de prévenir ou résoudre tous les conflits naissants. » L’exploitation sexuelle n’est que l’un des nombreux dangers auxquels les mineurs sont confrontés de l’autre côté des barbelés.

I believe they became more lax with their genetic requirements later on accounting for the amount of Jews in the SS. They ironically evolved their views on race the more countries they invaded.

They didn't. First the only discriminated against Jews, later they used them for forced labor and finally they massacred them. If anything they got more tough.

Nazi Race Theory had categories they ranked from most desirable to least:

1. North German - the purest Aryans, in Germany and Scandinavia

2. South Germans - Aryans, but they have mingled with other races, Bavaria, Austria, Switzerland etc.

&gt; THE Scottish Greens have said they will include a commitment to an independence referendum in their manifesto for the 2021 election as they welcomed Nicola Sturgeon’s promise to hold a new vote in the early part of the next Scottish Parliament.
&gt; 
&gt; Patrick Harvie, the party’s co-convener, gave a positive response to the First Minister’s promise which she made in her closing speech to the SNP conference yesterday afternoon.
&gt; 
&gt; The SNP leader made the announcement as she addressed voters watching her conference speech: “Next May we will ask you, the people of Scotland, to put your trust in us to continue that task of building a better country.
&gt; 
&gt; “I will ask you to judge us on our record and endorse our plans for the future. And in that election, I will seek your authority – no-one else’s – for a legal independence referendum to be held in the early part of the new parliament.”
&gt; 
&gt; Harvie responded: “The Scottish people are the only people who can determine their future, and it is right to say that they alone will decide when and whether there is an independence referendum.
&gt; 
&gt; “Scotland has the right to resume its place as an independent European nation, and the Scottish Greens will go into May’s election committing to a referendum. Our MSPs will be crucial to establishing a pro-independence majority.”
&gt; 
&gt; Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross said the First Minister is “completely out of touch” over her push for a second independence referendum and accused her of “grandstanding” over putting the campaign for one on hold at the start of the pandemic.
&gt; 
&gt; “She grandstanded about putting ‘independence on hold’, which would be a lot more believable if she didn’t launch a new Referendum Bill in September as a second wave of Covid was beginning,” he said.
&gt; 
&gt; “And all weekend she’s been talking up another divisive referendum next year while we’re in the middle of a pandemic. It’s completely out of touch with people across Scotland.
&gt; 
&gt; “Over the years a litany of SNP conference promises have flopped – from the Scottish Growth Scheme to the infamous Sturgeon Energy Company – so I sincerely hope these new commitments materialise but I don’t have much faith that they actually will.”
&gt; 
&gt; Anas Sarwar, Scottish Labour’s shadow constitution minister, said a second independence referendum was the First Minister’s top priority as he also hit out: “Nobody should now be in any doubt – Nicola Sturgeon’s only priority is to further divide our nation at a time when we should be healing,” he said.
&gt; 
&gt; “Her obsession with independence – mentioning it over 20 times in her speech – is shameful when people are losing their lives and livelihoods.
&gt; 
&gt; “On the UK stage she pretends that she has paused the independence campaign to focus on the pandemic, but the truth is that indyref2 remains her top priority.
&gt; 
&gt; “We can’t come straight out of a pandemic and go straight into a divisive referendum. Instead we should be pulling our people together and rebuilding our economy, protecting jobs, fixing our education system and delivering an NHS that never again has to choose between fighting a virus or treating cancer.”
&gt; 
&gt; Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie also attacked the First Minister’s announcement on a second independence referendum.
&gt; 
&gt; “The First Minister has put independence first,” he said.
&gt; 
&gt; “Everything else that needs to be done in Scotland, the mammoth task of recovery in front of us, all of that will have to wait for years in the queue behind another referendum.
&gt; 
&gt; “People who need urgent NHS care, who’s future depends on our education system getting back to being the best in the world or who are counting down the days for mental health support on long wait lists can’t afford to wait years or endure more division.
&gt; 
&gt; “What the people of Scotland need in this period of intense uncertainty is a focus on recovery, not referendums.”
&gt; 
&gt; During her address, the First Minister put forward the case that independent countries of a similar size to Scotland were among the wealthiest and happiest in the world.
&gt; 
&gt; “If Denmark can be a successful independent country, why not Scotland? If Ireland can and Norway can, why not Scotland? We have the resources, the wealth and the talent.” she said, insisting Westminster cannot veto Scotland’s “inalienable right of self-determination”.",True,False,False,,,,0,1606820052,,False,0,{},ge8yeax,True,t3_k4ia9f,False,False,t1_ge8y6t4,/r/Scotland/comments/k4ia9f/greens_commit_to_indyref2_as_nicola_sturgeon/ge8yeax/,False,,1618055536,25,True,False,Scotland,t5_2qkli,r/Scotland,public,,0,[],

&gt;December has arrived and the EU is staring over the cliff-edge and into a budgetary abyss. 

&gt;It’s been more than two weeks since Poland and Hungary brandished their vetoes over the bloc’s €1.8tn budget and Covid-19 recovery package over conditions linked to the rule of law. Now diplomats are increasingly despairing about the chances of an eleventh hour compromise.

&gt;The hard deadline to solve the spat is December 7. This marks the formal end of a legally mandated three-week “conciliation” period when EU governments and MEPs must thrash out the terms of the following year’s annual budget. Even during normal times, conciliation periods often go to the wire. In the grip of the coronavirus pandemic, the consequences of failure are far bigger than the usual end-of-year haggling between MEPs and governments over a few billion euros.

&gt;EU ambassadors will decide on Wednesday whether it is even worth starting 2021 budget negotiations with MEPs given the parlous state of affairs. Hungary’s premier Viktor Orban flew to Warsaw on Monday night for talks with Polish counterpart Mateusz Morawiecki, their second meeting in the past week and the first since demanding “substantial modifications” to the rule of law mechanism.

&gt;Piotr Muller, a spokesman for the Polish government, said on Monday evening Warsaw was “open to proposals” to resolve the rift. “We are convincing our partners that arbitrary criteria for judging the rule of law in certain countries can in the future lead to the collapse of the EU,” he said.

&gt;EU leaders, led by Germany’s Angela Merkel, will aim to break the deadlock at a summit in Brussels at the end of next week. As that is past the December 7 deadline, diplomats are all but resigned to the EU having to resort to an austerity budget known as the “provisional twelfths” for the first time in over 30 years. 

&gt;As the Brussels Briefing has written, this fallback would mean funding for new policy priorities such as health, climate change and migration would disappear. The EU would have to keep paying out subsidies to farmers and civil servants’ salaries, but billions in new structural funds for the poorest member states — including Poland and Hungary — would stop.

&gt;**The commission has told diplomats that in the absence of a budget deal, the lost funding would amount to around €25bn-€30bn a year. That figure does not include the delay to the €750bn pandemic recovery fund that was due to be up and running next year.** 

&gt;As time runs out, member states angered by hardball tactics from Budapest and Warsaw are growing emboldened. The toughest among them are the hard-nosed “frugals”, who think that a few months of an austerity regime and lost billions will force Poland and Hungary back to the negotiating table. These net-paying nations — the Austrians, Danes, Dutch and Swedes — also lose their rebates if there is no agreement. But that’s a blow they seem willing to bear.

&gt;One of the big open questions is how long the state of budget emergency will last. Officials are still considering creative solutions to minimise the financial damage during the EU’s worst recession in history.

&gt;One possible face saving compromise would be a deal over the seven-year budget at the summit. This would allow the spending plan to come into force in early 2021 with only a few weeks delay.

o que corresponde exatamente ao que eu disse lá em cima: é necessário se filiar a toda uma corrente de pensamento filosófico-político pra considerar esses países como democracia (e por consequência todos os outros como ditadura). O que, em minha visão, não chega nem perto de corresponder à nossa complexa realidade

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; O partido representa a vontade do povo, com inúmeros segmentos da sociedade sendo representados 

Aí é que tá, apesar de sistemas unipartidários terem alguma oposição interna elas não são verdadeiras oposições de fato. Isso se dá pelo simples fato de que elas não tem autonomia e a ala governante não tem quaisquer incentivos de aplicar uma que seja de suas medidas e ela não tem força pra angariar apoio e bloquear medidas do governo como um partido de fato o teria. Sem nem entrar no mérito de como a concentração de poder não mãos de um único partido - e, por consequência, nas mãos de um único cômite de gestão partidária - é algo extremamente anti-democrático e autoritário

&gt; quando foi a última vez que você participou de um? 

Eleições? duas semanas. Referendos e Plebiscitos? é verdade, nunca. Mas não vejo um grande problema nisso pois vejo benefícios em uma democracia representativa. Digo isso porque devido à atual situação ideológica do país não seria nada surpreendente um plebiscito definir pela criminalização do comunismo, ou abolição de quaisquer direitos ao aborto legal dentre outras matérias sensíveis.

&gt; EUA é um país bipartidarista, então eles não são uma democracia? 

Os EUA são uma democracia absurdamente atrasada, com instituições que remontam, ao menos, 100 anos de atraso. Eles estão longe de ser o meu ideal de democracia (este muito mais perto da república parlamentarista alemâ). Mas ainda assim, apesar de falha, continua tendo uma incrível participação da população, e até pouco tempo atrás era possível ver representante ignorando as linhas do bipartidarismo e votando leis em conjunto, pois acharem que isso seria o melhor à nação. Isso sem contar que existem partidos menores que, devido ao sistema eleitoral (first past the post + colégio eleitoral) não conseguem grandes resultados em escala nacional, mas existem diversos partidos locais ou até mesmo estaduais que conseguem certa influência no engajamento político de sua região.

&gt; A situação na Venezuela se resume a uma guerra retórica que a oposição muda de argumentação toda semana, vc abraçou a propaganda anti-venezuela, mas a situação é muito mais complexa que isso. 

Aí tu estás assumindo algo que eu nunca disse. Eu ser contra a forma como o governo venezuelano se manteve no poder não implica eu apoiar a sua oposição muito pelo contrário. Acho o Guaidó um pedaço de merda oportunista que jamais deveria ser presidente, mas isso não muda o fato de que o Maduro e seus correligionários erodiram as instituições democráticas venezuelanas e precisam enfrentar as críticas que isso carrega. Digo para que o Maduro renuncie pelo simples fato de que, se ele não o fizer, ou a venezuela continua nesse ciclo vicioso da última década ou acontece um golpe de vez, seja para qualquer um dos lados. Além do mais, até acredito que ele ou um de seus apoiadores poderia ser eleito novamente, enterrando de vez qualquer dúvida a respeito do processo eleitoral do país, nos mesmo moldes do que acabou acontecendo na Bolívia (apesar de lá já ter ocorrido o golpe). Além do mais, caso ele voltasse ao poder em eleições abertas e supervisionadas por instituições internacionais, qualquer problema de legitimidade que ele tivesse seria afastado e a venezuela poderia começar a sair do buraco que ela caiu. Penso nisso numa estratégia estilo de Gaulle pós maio de 68, quando ele dissolveu o parlamento, chamou novas eleições e o partido dele ganhou uma vitória expressiva novamente, reafirmando o seu poder político.

&gt;When the war began in Europe but had not yet been declared in the United States, there was a lot of talk about getting ready and being patriotic. The newspapers had big articles on businessmen volunteering to go to Plattsburg, New York, to do m ilitary training, and so on.  
&gt;  
&gt;I began to think I ought to make some kind of contribution, too. After I finished up at MIT, a friend of mine from the fraternity, Maurice Meyer, who was in the Army Signal Corps, took me to see a colonel at the Signal Corps offices in New York.  
&gt;  
&gt;""I'd like to aid my country sir, and since I'm technicallyminded, maybe there's a way I could help.""""Well, you'd better just go up to Plattsburg to boot camp and go through basic training. Then we'll be able to use you,"" the colonel said. ""But isn't there some way to use my talent more directly?""""No; this is the way the army is organized. Go through the regular way.""  
&gt;  
&gt;I went outside and sat in the park to think about it. I thought and thought: Maybe the best way to make a contribution is to go along with their way. But fortunately I thought a little more, and said, ""To hell with it! I'll wait awhile. Maybe something will happen where they can use me more effectively""

and

&gt;After the thing went off, there was tremendous excitement at Los Alamos. Everybody had parties, we all ran around. I sat on the end of a jeep and beat drums and so on. But one man, I remember, Bob Wilson, was just sitting there moping.  
&gt;  
&gt;I said, ""What are you moping about?""He said, ""It's a terrible thing that we made.""  
&gt;  
&gt;I said, ""But you started it. You got us into it.""  
&gt;  
&gt;You see, what happened to me-what happened to the rest of us--is we started for a good reason, then you're working very hard to accomplish something and it's a pleasure, it's excitement. And you stop thinking, you know; you just stop. Bob Wilson was the only one who was still thinking about it, at that moment.  
&gt;  
&gt;I returned to civilization shortly after that and went to Cornell to teach, and my first impression was a very strange one. I can't understand it any more, but I felt very strongly then. I sat in a restaurant in New York, for example, and I looked out at the buildings and I began to think, you know, about how much the radius of the Hiroshima bomb damage was and so forth . . . How far from here was 34th Street? . . . All those buildings, all smashed--and so on. And I would go along and I would see people building a bridge, or they'd be makin g a new road, and I thought, they're crazy, they just don't understand, they don't understand. Why are they making new things? It's so useless.

I'm not sure to which extent he really had regrets about working on the Manhatttan project, but at that time, the goals was indeed to destroy Hitler (and more importantly, develop a nuclear weapon *before* the nazis did), and their sense of patriotism greatly overshadowed any moral obligations.

&gt;  
&gt;As we now know, in September BiFab lost out on a major contract to contribute to the construction of the Neart Na Gaoithe (NnG) wind farm after Scottish ministers withdrew their offer of a £30 million guarantee. It is hard to see what future the company now has, when it has not been able to compete for this lucrative work, and with few similar opportunities on the near horizon.  
&gt;  
&gt;Facing political criticism from all sides, the SNP Economy Secretary Fiona Hyslop sought to deflect the blame, claiming that EU state-aid rules have made the offer of a guarantee impossible, and complaining of a lack of support from BiFab’s Canadian parent company, JVDriver.  
&gt;  
&gt;Unsurprisingly, she also sought to pass the blame on to the UK government for its “contracts for difference” subsidy scheme for offshore wind which does not attach any conditions requiring the work to be carried out within the UK.  
&gt;  
&gt;Last week, BiFab hit back at the Scottish government for their claims about JVDriver, stating that they were “perplexed and disappointed” at the SNP’s stance. Far from JVDriver standing in the way, BiFab stated, they repeatedly offered to transfer their shares in the Scottish company to the Scottish government at no cost. This offer was not taken up and is still open. Accordingly, the statements of SNP ministers about BiFab have been, in their words, “inaccurate or untruthful”.  
&gt;  
&gt;If this were not damaging enough, the trade unions GMB and Unite joined together to issue a damning statement against the SNP government, demanding that the legal advice underpinning the decision to walk away from BiFab be published, and slamming the government’s announcement last week as “an act of bad faith \[which\] made a mockery of the so-called fair work agenda”.  
&gt;  
&gt;Whilst it is indeed the UK government which grants contracts for difference, on a bidding system, the planning consent for offshore wind projects is in the gift of Scottish ministers, on advice from Marine Scotland. It was therefore entirely under the control of SNP ministers at the time that consent was issued to insert conditions requiring a local employment and training strategy. This was not taken up at the time, and it seems a shameless piece of deflection by the SNP now to try and absolve themselves of all responsibility for the matter, and pass the blame onto others.  
&gt;  
&gt;We were all promised a bright future in terms of manufacturing and engineering jobs from renewable energy in Scotland. At the first hurdle, we have been badly let down.  
&gt;  
&gt;A company like BiFab deserves better than it has had so far from the SNP government, and they have it within their hands to take action now to provide much-needed employment in Fife and on Lewis.

You're wrong on essentially all counts.

1) Many Americans are not ""blinded"" to what other countries are doing, we're well read on the world and other nations.

2) Not being debatable and being agreed upon are two different things.  As Reagan said, ""The closest thing to eternal life is a government program"" because once enacted, people don't want to give them up, even if it would be better for them to do so.  For example, Social Security is BY DEFINITION a Ponzi Scheme, but people feel they've paid into the system, so don't want to give it up even though it would be better for future generations and for anyone under 50 years old to do so.

2b) And it's not even right to say ""most countries"".  More countries in the world don't agree with you than agree with you on this.  You can say ""developed"" all you want, that doesn't change this fact.

3) Socialist, not communist, which it is.

4) ""a few steps behind"" is debatable.  Not all progress is better, nor is all ""forward"" motion getting you ahead.  Europeans are more European, and your own view is horrifically Euro-centric here.

5) The reason the US doesn't have ""middle ground"" is because of the forces stoking and playing both sides against each other.

This may come off as particularly cynical. But I'm not sure how European measures could substitute this amount of exports. And personally, I find it problematic to encourage international exports of products such as wine when there is argumentatively more qualitative (and quantitative) local products. From an environmental as well as a geo-cultural perspective it's not really sustainable. 

With that said, of course I feel some solidarity with Australians and Australian wine makers in particular. But ""buying a bottle or two"" of Australian wine won't make up for the loss of one of the biggest trade partners within that sector.  Instead, it risks rerouting European consumers (albeit temporarily) from supporting European wine makers who've had one of the the worst years in recent times.

I wouldn’t be surprised if multiple distributors have a “most favored nation” clause with a programmer or two, and they think they’re the only one who has it.

In Europe it’s much more straightforward, and more expensive. Nearly all sports programming channels are forced on the absolute most expensive packages. If you want BT Sport or Sky Sports, it’s (generally) an additional $30 USD per month to get just one group of those sports channels.

Imagine a world where you have a base local/entertainment package of channels for $40, but if you want the suite of ESPN/SEC/ACC channels that’ll be $30 more per month. Want FS1/FS2/BigTen? That’ll be $20 more per month. Want RSN’s? That’ll be an additional $10 per month.

How is riding a factory team with a bike capable of top 10 (or even top 5), capable of qualifying top row is ""losing a year"" of his carrer?

&gt;It literally is far off, revist this season's stats. Aprilia started out alongside KTM and Suzuki, look how far ahead they are now.

The bike did 2 top 10 finishes with Aleix Espargaro, a pretty average rider. Aleix didn't do better than 11th in the championship in the Suzuki. Even a pretty low rent rider like Bradley smith was having competitive pace.Iannone would have put a much better show. It's the worse bike on the grid, but the bike is competitive.

In Portugal, Aleix finished only 4 seconds behind his brother Pol in the KTM who finished 4th. In Valencia he finished 15 seconds behind the lead rider, ahead of both Factory Yamaha riders, Bagnaia, Petrucci, Cruthclow, etc... Again... with Aleix Espargaro... A guy that is racing in Motogp since 2004 and only got 1 podium in his entire career (moto2).

Put a race winning guy in that bike and it would perform much much better. Not saying he's going to win the championship, but I feel like the bike is capable of the odd podium with a good rider.

&gt;A non-European rider cannot stake his career on *might be* though. Why discard the opportunity to perform in a championship winning team? Even a runner-up would get him a satellite ride from better teams in the future.

Why? because the guys is 23 years old and is riding Moto2 bikes for 4 years. Next year will be his 4th complete season in Moto2. His previous finishes were 27th, 28th and 7th... And hes offered a Factory GP ride lol.

he's a decent rider but I don't seem him winning the championship or even finishing top 3. He's not going to land a seat in a top MotoGP team, Aprilia was a good oportinity that he might never get.

&gt;A step down after a dismal year or two with Aprilia guarantees he'll never join the premiere class grid again. That's what he has to lose.

He got to be there and got his oportunity. Staying in moto2 might not even get him in gp ever. He has to step up big time from previous seasons to even get a chance at a GP seat.

Look at Zarco, needed to win the championship 2x to get a GP seat. This season was an outlier, because 3rd or 4th place in moto2 don't give you GP rides.Baldassari is a better rider than Roberts and never got a GP ride.

Moto2 is tought! That's why rider likes like Oliveira grab the GP ride as soon as possible, and rider like miller don't go to Moto2 at all.

no entanto, não entendo como uma criptomoeda evitaria ou diminuiria a concentração dos meios de produção. eu não consigo nem imaginar criptomoedas como mecanismos eficientes de redução do capital fictício.. na verdade, o contrário... vide o mercado de derivativos montado em cima de bitcoins. e veja que vc pode criar qualquer moeda com qualquer variação de oferta.. fora o fato de que, inclusive, temos proof of stake como mecanismo de recompensa.

mesmo o sonho do fim do Estado (que não é sinônimo de comunismo), não me parece tangível por criptomoedas. o q impediria o Estado de cobrar um valor elevado por propriedade na ausência da taxação de renda/transação?

por sinal, não acho que criptomoeda mude alguma coisa da estrutura macro... nem acho essa mudança exista com os modelos de organizações descentralizadas (pois nao tiram a concentração dos meios de produção). esses modelos nem são tão diferentes da propria moeda fiat (no caso da criptomoeda).. ou das associações de trabalhadores do sec XIX contratados de forma independente (terceirizada, no caso das organizações descentralizadas).

[],,PseudoDaniel,,,,[],,,,text,t2_5osyawpn,False,False,[],"Hi, I'm the guy that made the map responsible for this mess of a timeline :) Here's some official lore:

&amp;#x200B;

\-France remains a heavily decentralized kingdom, with the sun king unable to create a unified state. 

 \-The Habsburg realm is much larger, with the creation of the kingdom of Burgundy. Part of the Netherlands remains under Habsburg control as the Duchy of Holland. Milan remains part of Spain. 

 \-The Habsburg realm is split into three parts: Burgundy, Austria &amp; the H.R.E., and Spain with Naples and Milan.  

\-The H.R.E. is much more centralized and is lead by Austria. Burgundy is starting to become a threat to Austrian domination in Germany. 

 \-Protestantism remains dominant in the Nordic countries. The H.R.E. tolerates Protestantism as a result of the bloodshed of the thirty years war but the religion remains a minority, with catholicism being the main force.  

\-Italy is heavily dominated by Spain except for Savoy, which remains a strong power in the region.  In 1802 a certain revolt in Tuscany lead Napoleon Buenoparte to take power, with his liberal ideas in hand, he created the 'First Italian Empire', and after the course of 10 years lead a mostly successful campaign that ended after an unsuccessful invasion of mainland Spain. He was exiled, but his successor Louis-Napoleon is a prominent figure in Italy who could possibly continue the family tradition.

\-The United Kingdom still experiences the civil war, but the glorious revolution fails. Spain, Austria, and the H.R.E. form a coalition to put James II on the throne of the U.K., they succeed. Also, because the Netherlands doesn't exist in this timeline, there isn't a strong candidate against him. In 1750, England, Scotland and Ireland are ruled by King James III, son of James II.  

\-Prussia never manages to become the strong militarist, protestant kingdom that it is in our world, as the H.R.E. is dominated by a coalition of Catholic states. As a result, Poland-Lithuania is never forced to concede territory to it and remains a great power. The only possible enemy to it would be Sweden, though it is still recovering from the thirty years war.  -Russia still manages to westernize, but unlike in OTL, Peter I is sent to Austria instead of Holland, and as a result, Russia has much more closer ties to Austria. Instead of OTL, Catherine the great never becomes empress, as she is a protestant, and Russia has heavy ties to catholic Austria.

THE HABSBURGS:      

Austria  

\-The H.R.E. becomes a centralized state after the reforms of the Habsburgs. No more feudalsim and in fighting. There is a revolt from the northern mostly protestant states (Barndenburg-Prussia, Hannover, Hesse, Saxony) but they are quickly crushed and the H.R.E. becomes one nation. Now, the Austrian Habsburgs put Hungary into the H.R.E. as one of it's three constituent kingdoms: Germany, Bohemia and itself. The Austrian foreign policy is slightly conservative. 

Burgundy  

\-First created as a minor branch of the Habsburg realm, Burgundy conquered it's surrounding city states and became a rival of the H.R.E. After the empire's centralization, it was the only German state to completely brake away from it and form it's own kingdom. Surprisingly, Burgundy is supportive of France and financed it's return from feudalsim (more on that later), and was the first european monarchy to have a constitution. Burgundy's ambitions lie in Switzerland and overseas, as the nation heavily supports colonization of America and India. It is by far the most liberal of the Habsburg realms.  

3) Spain  -The most important of the three, Spain remained the largest European power. After a series of wars in Italy, it managed to unify the northern Italian states and secure an alliance with the Pope. A war with the Ottomans granted them the Peloponnes. Spain is the most conservative and religious nation in Europe. It never lost it's colonies and still has most of South America under it's control.

FRANCE 

 \-After the 30 years war, France was shattered into a heavily feudalist nation with no real power held by the king. Even the ambitions of Louis XV couldn't centralize the nation. In 1779 a nationalist coup by Anne Robert Jacques Turgot in Versailles forced Louis XVI to abdicate in favour of a republic. This government is not similar to the french republic of OTL, but instead resembles the Dutch republic in OTL, with a heavy focus on centralization and trade. The new government was quickly met with resistance, as a number of religious nobles from the south decided to seek indepndence. Heavily backed by Spain, they succeeded. France maintains good relations with the Burgundian monarchy.   

BRITAIN  

 \-After an attempt at removing the catholic James III from the throne, the powers of Europe quickly threaten military intervention if the stuart monarch was not reinstated. As a result, Britain remained a catholic nation under a Stuart monarch well into the start of the XIX century. The thirteen colonies never formed, as Britain never focused on colonial development, with matters at home being more pressing. North America was mainly a mix of Burgundian colonies, failing Austrian outposts and French trading ports.   

RUSSIA   

\-Basically, not a lot changes, except Peter III and Catherine II never make it to the throne (with them being protetant and all), so Russia is much more close with Autria (as seen by the flag). Poland is never partitioned but rather just eaten away by Russia.

NORTH AMERICA

Neue Lotharingia.  

A colony of the Kingdom of Burgundy, the most liberal monarchy in Europe, Neue Lotharingia is the second most populated colony in the region, with the most cities and infrastructure. After the treaty of Westphalia, the British colonies in New England were given to the then newly formed Kingdom of Burgundy. It has an ethnic makeup of mainly protestant refugees from the low countries, englishmen, germans, and frenchmen. It is the most ethnically diverse colony in North America. Its main rival is the British colony of Carolina.   

2) Francis's Land  A colony of the Austrian Habsburgs and the H.R.E., it was created after the first French holdings in North America were given to them in the treaty of Westphalia. Sparsely populated, the two main cities: Neue Vienna and Neue Graz, are mere villages, and little stand in the way of a conquest from the U.K., except for retaliation in Europe.   

3) Carolina and Nova Scotia  The remaining colonies of the U.K., they were the only ones to be left to the U.K. after their brief attempt at installing an protestant monarch - William of Orange. Carolina is the more developed of the two, but stands between the colonial powerhouses of Spain and Burgundy. Nova Scotia is a trading outpost with strong military presence, but little inhabitants.

Iles  Occidentales, Terre de Liberte, Terre Republicaine, and the French West  Indies :

4) After the coup of Thurgot, and installation of the republic, France  quickly turned its attention to trade, and began to quickly set up major  cities in North America and the Carribean. They are the most profitable  parts of North America, with storng naval protection and developed  infrastructure. Most have a large west african population along with a  diverse european upper class.   

5) New Spain  The center of the new world, the Spanish colony is the most populated in  the region, and is envied by all those around it. Nothing much can be  said about it, except for the fact that it is a highly prized posession  and a possible spark for war.   

6) Scandinavian colonies  Nya Sverige and the Danish West Indies are one of the last fully  protestant places in North America. They aren't as well protected and  could soon be taken by France and Burgundy   

7) The Meer Republiek and the Calvinist State  Founded by Dutch protestants from Burgundy, these are two militarised  nations, situated on the outskirts of civilization. Heavily reliand on  guerilla tactics and cooperative with natives, they are hard to conquer.  While allied, they have their differences. For one, the Meer Republiek  is a secular state, while the Calvinist State is a religious one. They  will likely be the first of many unrecognized protestant republics.",True,False,False,,,,0,1606828548,,False,0,{},ge97nby,False,t3_k4kdbh,False,False,t3_k4kdbh,/r/victoria2/comments/k4kdbh/germany_and_the_hre_in_the_upcoming_mod_la_era/ge97nby/,False,,1618059982,156,True,False,victoria2,t5_2uadi,r/victoria2,public,,0,[],

&gt; # [España sufre la peor recesión del mundo después de la de Argentina, según la OCDE](https://www.abc.es/economia/512)
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt; MADRID Actualizado:01/12/2020 12:25h&lt;a data-btn=""starred"" data-id=""1683a54a-3324-11eb-9029-2a34b475b66d"" data-nibara-module=""starred"" data-type=""noticia"" data-voc-vtm-id=""leerdespues"" data-voc-vtm-info=""sticky"" title=""Guardar el artículo""&gt; Guardar &lt;/a&gt;La destrucción de actividad ha vuelto de la mano de la segunda ola y cada vez más organismos alertan de que habrá una recaída en los tres últimos meses del año. El último ha sido la Organización para la Cooperación y el Desarrollo Económico (OCDE), que en sus últimas previsiones económicas mundiales alerta del **«fuerte aumento de contagios» en España** que, junto a los nuevos confinamientos y demás, provocará «una contracción en el cuarto trimestre». De esta forma, si la institución dibujaba dos escenarios en sus anteriores previsiones, según hubiera o no rebrote, el avance de 2020 permite [afinar el tiro y ya augura un solo escenario.](https://www.abc.es/economia/abci-espana-perdio-15-millones-empleos-ritmo-tres-veces-mayor-202009082125_noticia.html) Y si bien no se cumplen los peores pronósticos de junio, que recogían una caída de hasta un 14,4% este año ya que la segunda ola no ha sido tan dañina como la primera, **España sufrirá la segunda mayor recesión entre los 46 estados analizados por la OCDE, solo superada por Argentina.**
&gt; 
&gt; Nuestro país recogerá una **caída del PIB del 11,6%.** Solo Argentina, con las medidas de confinamiento más agudas en el planeta, experimenta una caída mayor, del 12,9% en 2020, mientras que la tercera economía con un mayor desplome será Reino Unido, con un -11,2%. Para el próximo año, la OCDE pronostica para España una recuperación del 5% que será del 4% en 2022.
&gt; 
&gt; A mitad de 2020, la economía española había cosechado **la mayor caída de la OCDE después de la India**, perdiendo más de un 21% de la actividad. Sin embargo, el crecimiento del 16,7% en verano permitió acortar las diferencias, aunque la OCDE resalta que en septiembre el número de turistas era un 87,1% menor al de un año antes, mientras que el gasto con tarjeta de los extranjeros se había desplomado un 65% en octubre. Había mucho por recuperar, una herida que ahora vuelve a abrirse con los confinamientos de otoño.
&gt; 
&gt; ### Europa dobla la recesión de EE.UU.
&gt; 
&gt; La caída este año, así, es la mayor de Europa, siendo **el doble que el -5,5% de Alemania** y superando a **Italia** (-9,1%), **Francia** (-9,1%), **Portugal** (-8%) o **Grecia** (-10,1%). El Gobierno prevé una recesión del -11,2% este año y una recuperación del 9,8% en 2021 (con un impacto de 1,6 puntos de crecimiento proveniente del efecto tractor de los fondos europeos).
&gt; 
&gt; [Europa, de hecho, es una de las zonas más afectadas por la pandemia](https://www.abc.es/tmp/economia/abci-espana-sufrira-mayor-recesion-mundo-si-rebrote-caida-144-por-ciento-202006101006_noticia.html). La Eurozona se contraerá un 7,5%, el doble que Estados Unidos (-3,7%) y lejos de China, origen de la epidemia y que arroja un crecimiento previsto este año del 1,8%. Se **trata del único país que crecerá este año** entre los analizados por el organismo.
&gt; 
&gt; ### Las restricciones hunden los servicios
&gt; 
&gt; La OCDE augura para España que si se recupera la demanda externa y el turismo, nuestro país experimentará un crecimiento mayor, y constata, eso sí, que la industria está comportándose bastante mejor que los servicios, muy afectados por las limitaciones a la actividad y de movilidad.
&gt; 
&gt; «Los indicadores de actividad manufacturera continúan recuperándose, **pero los de servicios registraron una caída más pronunciada, debido a las nuevas medidas de contención**», resalta.
&gt; 
&gt; ### La salida de los ERTE se frena
&gt; 
&gt; En cuanto al mercado laboral, nuestro país tendrá el próximo año la segunda mayor tasa de paro de los países analizados: un 17,4%, solo superado por el 17,8% de Grecia. Para 2020 cree que el desempleo acabará en el 15,8% gracias, en parte, a los ERTE. «El número de trabajadores que seguía en ERTE en octubre representó un 18% del pico de abril. Sin embargo, **el ritmo de salida se ha ralentizado**, y los trabajadores restantes se concentran en los sectores y regiones más afectados por la crisis», señala.
&gt; 
&gt; **Entre los riesgos que pueden hundir aún más la economía**, la OCDE cita [«efectos más persistentes sobre la solvencia de los hogares y las empresas»](https://www.abc.es/economia/abci-pandemia-resucita-fantasmas-crisis-europa-202003140239_noticia.html). «Una prolongación de la crisis puede empujar a empresas viables a la insolvencia», concluye la OCDE.
&gt; 
&gt; Las nuevas medidas, en palabras de la institución, deben ayudar a los más damnificados por los nuevos confinamientos, reclama la OCDE, además de fomentar el reciclaje formativo entre los trabajadores afectados por ERTE. El organismo, en definitiva, llama al Gobierno a **continuar con las medidas de protección**, además de aprobar reformas que eleven la productividad y que afronten la «fragmentación» del mercado interno.
&gt; 
&gt; Como fuere, el impacto en las arcas públicas se materializará con un déficit del 11,7% este año, del 9% el que viene y del 6,6% aún en 2022, que llevará a la deuda pública a dispararse al 117,3% del PIB este año. Pese al crecimiento, esta seguirá aumentando en 2021 (120,5%) y 2022 (122,4%), mientras no se cierre el boquete en las cuentas públicas. **Se trata del mayor déficit de la Eurozona.**
&gt; 
&gt; ### Reforma de la Ley de Segunda Oportunidad
&gt; 
&gt; La **OCDE reclama leyes de segunda oportunidad** más amplias para los empresarios que hayan caído en quiebra por la crisis y quieran volver a reflotar su negocio o crear uno nuevo, a través de «la exención de pagar la deuda contraída con los ingresos futuros por la liquidación». Y revela que el Ejecutivo contempla algunas de estas medidas.
&gt; 
&gt; «Muchos países ya están reduciendo el tiempo para volver a darse de alta sin obligaciones pasadas a tres años para estar en línea con la Directiva de la UE sobre insolvencia y segunda oportunidad (por ejemplo, Alemania), pero podrían intentar acelerar esta parte de la reforma, lo que puede facilitar las reestructuraciones (por ejemplo, España está considerando esta opción)», abunda la OCDE.

However DoTD and HellBent showed us a much more complex relationship, the Doctor wishing Gallifrey was as it used to be before the War (ironic for how much he chastised them for being a stagnant civilisation in Classic who and EU and now he wants it all how it used to be), but aware of how damaged and changed his people are by the war and its effects.

And when he saves it in DOTD we see him now wanting to *go home*. To see if what he saved was Gallifrey of old (and possibly of its future) who bound themselves to watch over reality. Or Gallifrey of the War (desperate. Dangerous. Ruthless in extremis).

And in HellBent we see....it’s a bit of both. Remnants of War Gallifrey with Rassilon at the centre trying to keep the population in that military and hard edged mindset. And then the Doctor freeing his people from that shackle and leaving them to be what they choose to be.

Not True? Feylis are in Fact Kurdish,nor Lurs,They were known as ""Feyli Kurds"" for most of History,They themselves Speak an Dialect that's apart of the Southern Kurdish Language.


&gt;and they are heavily pushing kurdification towards Lak people that are lurs


 ""Heavily Pushing Kurdification"" are you Joking or Just Spitting Gibberish? The Laks are an Kurdish group and they have NOTHING to do with Lurs,in fact, They're Completely an Seperate People from Lurs.

Actually,the Term ""Lur"" itself is not a proper set term, they are just a group of tribes who inhabit Lorēstan. Such groups are Laks, Bakhtiaris,Mamasani etc, They speak a variety of dialects, and the Laks speak  Laki which is similar to Luri but an different language.


And Plus,the Laks themselves are Classified as An Kurdish tribe, that's an Undeniable Fact,Laki Is also Classified as an Kurdish dialect by most Linguists. Vladimir Minorsky,also  referred to the Laks as ""the most southern group of Kurd tribes in Persia"" and stated that their language has the characteristics of the Kurdish language.

Laks themselves are [spread] (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/763826503783284770/780817167049687040/IMG_20201124_182817.jpg) out with other Kurdish tribes and some Kurdish tribes also have Laki Kurdish Origns as well.

 Sources:

 [1] - [Iranica Online] (https://iranicaonline.org/articles/lak-tribe)  : ""The main ethnic marker of the Lak is their language called “Laki.”  On the basis of the linguistic fieldwork made by the German linguist Oskar Mann, Vladimir Minorsky mentioned the Lak as “the most southern group of Kurd tribes of Persia” (Minorky, “Lak,” p. 616).  After field research made by Oskar Mann, there remained until recently no doubt about the nature of the Laki language.  After the death of Oskar Mann, Karl Hadank continued to work on the material collected by him.  Both of these linguists declared that Laki was related to Kurdish and different from Lori.  Since then, all linguists and other scholars consider Laki to be included in the Northwest group of Iranian language and include Lori among the Southwest group of Iranian languages.  It has been only recently that some linguists, on the basis of a new scientific approach, have begun to have doubt about this kind of classifications in general.  Moreover, Oskar Mann had rightly found that the difference between Laki and other southern Kurdish dialects to be only minor (“nur unwesentlich”; Mann, p. xxiii).  Therefore, he puts Laki along with other south Kurdish dialects under the general rubric “Laki” (Mann, p. xxvii).  What is more, in a list compiled by J. L. Rousseau at Kermanshah in 1807, several south Kurdish tribes like the Kalhor, Māfi, Ṣufiwand, Karkuʾi, Jalilvand, and Kolyāʾi have been classified among the Laki tribes (Rousseau, pp. 85-98).""

Anyways,Zazas *Are* an Kurdish Group,The They are undeniably a Kurdish Group,The Zazas are a Kurdish Group,The Overwhelming Majority of them Consider themselves to be Kurdish.


 From the Wikipedia page : 

""""The Zazas (also known as Kird, Kirmanc or Dimili) are a people in eastern Turkey who speak the Zaza language. Their heartland consists of Tunceli and Bingöl provinces and parts of Elazığ, Erzincan and Diyarbakır provinces. Zazas generally consider themselves Kurds, and are often described as Zaza Kurds.""""

It is a huge collection of Sources which classify the Zazas as an Kurdish Group,and their language as an Kurdish Dialect.

As for the Hewramis/Gorani People,They are Classified as an Kurdish Group not only by Western Sources but also by [Iranian Enclopaedias] (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/763826503783284770/783310604802457630/IMG_20201201_153627.jpg) ,The Article also states that Laks are an Kurdish Tribe,as well.

Furthermore, the Guran (as 'Kurani') poped up as a Kurdish tribe since the Middle Ages frequently,I'm sure one of the medieval Arabic-language geographers mentions the Kurani (remember that Arabic script originally had no 'G', so they used 'K'), perhaps it was Masudi or Hamawi.

Sharafxan also mentions the Kurani,As well a Sharafnama,which states that the Kurdish Tribes of Iran are as follows :

""Kurds of Iran: Lek, Zend, Rozbehan, Metîlec, Hasîrî, şehrezolî, Mezyar, Kelanî, Emînlû, Memeloyî, Kec, Kuranî, Ziktî, Kelegîr, Pazûkî, Wehî, çemîşgezek, ‘Erebkîrlû. Qerebax: Yîrmîdört. Xorasan: Kêl.""

Now,Moving on to the Goranî Language,we can see that All the Goranî dialects are influenced by Kurdish lexically and morphologically,And Plus,Almost all Re-Searchers Consider Goranî an Kurdish Dialect.

The Sources regarding my claims are as follows :

Tavadze,At Bulletin of the Georgian National Academy of Sciences,Year 2019,It starts with : ""The Kurdish language belongs to the Indo-Iranian linguistic group, which in turn is a part of the Indo-European linguistic family. Living for centuries in a vast area of the Middle East, where harsh physical-geographic and political environment prevailed, was one of the main causes of division of the Kurdish pra-language into several distinct dialects. These dialects continued to subdivide, which resulted in the appearance of distinguished subdialects. Besides the three main dialect groups (Northern or Kurmanji; Central or Sorani and Southern Kurdish), there are two more languages or dialects – Zaza (Zazaki) and Gorani. They are used in the remotest parts of the Kurdish ethnic region and a number of western and Kurdish specialists even consider them as not related to the Kurdish language. However, the speakers of Zaza and Gorani consider themselves Kurdish. Three dialects developed their own literature and two of them – Kurmanji and Sorani – are competing for superiority.""


[3] - An [Re-Search Gate] (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/295093908_Automatic_Kurdish_Dialects_Identification) Article titled ""Automatic Kurdish Dialects Identification"" by Hossein Hassani [University of Kurdistan Hewlêr] And Dzejla Medjedovic [International University of Sarajevo],Year 2016,it starts with : ""Automatic dialect identification is a necessary Language Technology for processing multidialect languages in which the dialects are linguistically far from each other. Particularly, this becomes crucial where the dialects are mutually unintelligible. Therefore, to perform computational activities on these languages, the system needs to identify the dialect that is the subject of the process. Kurdish language encompasses various dialects. It is written using several different scripts. The language lacks of a standard orthography. This situation makes the Kurdish dialectal identification more interesting and required, both form the research and from the application perspectives.""

I don't know what to say, dude.

That's... not that bad right?"" and others that say ""omg thousands?! We need to act!"". I belong to the first group, because I've been following other illnesses the last few years, and while this one is a bit worse, it's still not THAT bad. Why is it that suddenly, now, we care so much?

If you want to base your argument on the Arabs being the true rulers of Israel, and Arabic culture being the correct culture for Israel, rather than the culture of a mere  minority - you're not going to win that argument. I mean, you can make very compelling points, but Israelis aren't going to be convinced by something like that.

If you ignore that point, then yes, it's generally a great thing for the minority to learn the language of the majority, and integrate into the majority society. Jews self-segregated for centuries in Europe, and it only fostered centuries of oppression. The moment some Jews abandoned it, started learning the majority language, and going to ""Christian"" schools, they became prime ministers and captains of industry, and created the idea of an integrated Jewish-Christian society we know today.

Note that I personally think Israeli Jews should learn Arabic, and we should be a bilingual society. But Israeli Jews don't really suffer that much from not knowing Arabic, or not being integrated into the Arab Israeli society. While the Arab Israelis suffer quite a bit from the inverse.

&gt;Furthermore, the lawsuit works within Israeli law. Israeli law doesn't compel the local government to establish Jewish-Arab unsegregated schools. That was requested by the residents, but the municipality rejected it.

**Platforms**: PC, PS4/PS5 

**Hours**: Mostly NA On the PC side. NA and EU on the ps4 side.  

**Focus**: Become best friends with the murderous AI and his robot children

Our focus is on PvE and endgame content but that doesn’t stop us from jumping in to some semi sweaty PvP. We are not a group of super tryhards but we also don’t like to mess around and spend hours in raids doing stuff just for the luls.

**About Us**: We're Seraphim Elite, Born in 2016, we're a community of guardians split over PC and PS4, with a clan for each platform. We have an ongoing mission of making an active community and not just an active clan. We believe that what you put in is what you will get out. This isn’t our clan, it’s your clan. While this community is mostly centered on destiny we are a place where people can come together and joke and talk about anything from video games to sports and life in general. 

**Requirements**: We do NOT provide carries (Unless you are named Omnislash) and we don't provide welfare engrams. Being a good raider is important, but being a good raid member is more important. We want to find people that are a good fit in our community. You will be accepted into the clan upon joining our discord but initially as a recruit. We have a process our new people go through so you can get a feel for the clan and our members before you become a full fledged Seraphim. Find out more about this process when you join our discord server.

**Criteria for joining**

1) Be 18+ Physically and mentally.  

2) Have a mic/headset. If we can hear your game or it sounds like you are playing inside a helicopter or in the middle of the freeway you will be asked to leave until you can find a proper headset.

3) Be able to communicate and listen. Be honest about your experience level.

4) Be active in **Discord** and in game.

5) No ~~fucking~~ swearing (This is a joke because some people are bad at jokes or understanding jokes. So you can swear if you want, or don’t swear (I am not the swear police)

6) Speaking of jokes we like to have a good time but being edgy, or racist, or homophobic will put you on the fast track to bansville. 
7) Have very strong opinions on what kind of toppings are appropriate for pizza. Also Mayo. Also cookies. Be ready to fight over your opinions. We are not a judgmental group until it comes to your food choices. 

8) No political conversations or memes. Those topics are too polarizing and only serve to drive people apart. We want our community to be about games. 


Participation in our **DISCORD** server is essential. We do check for in game and Discord activity but the requirements of this activity are minimal (speak a few times a month). We are focused on our community and building online friendships so we feel these requirements should be easy to satisfy. 

Follow the link below to our discord server to get started, and if you can't cause the site is down please wait until it's back up to follow the link!

If you reply to this I will try to get back to you as soon I can. Your best bet to get ahold of me is to join our discord. Follow the bungie link below to get a link for our discord server

I do completely understand the issue with the long hours. However, like I mentioned before, residents in Europe, in general, work less hours but finish their residencies not being completely autonomous, even more so in surgical specialities. It is not about not having yet done any fellowship, it is just how the system works. In some countries, like Switzerland for example, opportunities to actually operate during residency are very limited. In Switzerland, one starts to truly operate more, only after one obtains the specialist title. This very often happens also in Germany but with more variability, it highly depends on the teaching culture of a given hospital. So my point is, yes it sucks to work 10-20h/week more in the US but at the end of the road, you guys are closer to independence than we are here in Europe. In the US you finish your residency and you feel like an attending. Here in Europe we finish our residency and we still feel like residents but with more responsibility and accountability.

Then again, with this independence being achieved in the US, you don't actually have to settle for the shity work that you may have at one given hospital. The system allows you to change, to go somewhere else or to even say ""f*ck you all, I am going to open my own practice"". We also may get this opportunities in Europe but I assure you it happens much later in our careers.

So is it worth it to work 10-20h/week and achieve autonomy earlier? Well, depends on the perspective. For me personally, I would sacrifice those 10-20h, so that I get more freedom to do what I want, how I want, in 4-6 years time. Yet, I understand, and respect, both perspectives.

Well, those 150-190k in Netherlands are surely before tax, as well as the 90k in Germany are also before tax. I am not familiar with how much taxes people actually pay in the US, but in Germany, by earning something like 90k, it means that they will take away over 40% of that. So yeah, that means getting like 5k a month after tax, roughly (I didn't bother to the the math exactly and I also don't know the exact percentage for each tax bracket in Germany). So, with that 1000 dollar/month plan to pay off your debt, that means 20% of your salary. This is huge.

Working as a doctor in the US means being upper class, while working as a doctor in Europe means being middle class in terms of salary until the days your joints will start to ache due the osteoarthritis. Then again, it always boils down to perspective: making 300-400k/year + having the high probability to work in a hospital with super bad work culture vs getting 100k + pay higher taxes + not being autonomous for a very long time but working overall a tad less hours per week.",True,False,False,,,,0,1606832667,,False,0,{},ge9e0l5,False,t3_k3khu8,False,True,t1_ge9ahuk,/r/medicalschoolEU/comments/k3khu8/any_medical_students_or_residents_in_the/ge9e0l5/,False,,1618062983,1,True,False,medicalschoolEU,t5_1ey1ud,r/medicalschoolEU,public,,0,[],

In general, Russians drink loose leaf tea more than Europeans or Americans, who almost always use teabags. At least that was my impression. It's common to add some herbs to tea, like mint, melissa or thyme, although high quality tea is usually used without any additions. Japanese tea is not that popular - matcha is only gaining popularity and it's not that easy to find, while genmaicha or hojicha is quite a niche drink, and I don't know anyone who likes to drink sencha at home, although you can find it in many restaurant menus.

&gt; Those hoping for a semblance of calm in the Middle East in the final days of Donald Trump’s presidency have been rudely awakened by the assassination of Iran’s top nuclear scientist. Iranian leaders immediately blamed Israel for last week’s killing of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh. Israel typically neither denies nor confirms such hits, preferring ambiguity to accountability, while reinforcing the mystique of its secret services. But it is hard to imagine any other state conducting such an audacious attack. And the two leaders it serves most are Mr Trump and Israel’s premier Benjamin Netanyahu, a like-minded hawk on Iran.
&gt; 
&gt; The assassination ramps up Middle East tensions after months of relative calm, and risks making it far harder for Joe Biden to fulfil his pledge to open negotiations with Iran and rejoin the 2015 nuclear accord if Tehran agrees to return to full compliance with the deal. Mr Trump and Mr Netanyahu both appear bent on doing their best to scupper the US president-elect’s chances before he settles into the White House.
&gt; 
&gt; Since his election defeat, the fear in the region has been that Mr Trump could lash out at Iran or its allies in a parting shot that would dash hopes of bringing Tehran back to the table. Last month, he reportedly asked senior advisers for options to strike Iranian nuclear facilities, before being dissuaded from taking military action. But if Mr Netanyahu wanted to order a strike against the Islamic regime, when better to do it than when one of the most anti-Iranian and pro-Israeli US presidents is still in office?
&gt; 
&gt; Mr Trump has already done his utmost to destroy the nuclear deal that Tehran signed with world powers and isolate Iran after unilaterally withdrawing the US from the accord and imposing the severest of sanctions regimes. Yet his “maximum pressure” strategy has failed.
&gt; 
&gt; True, Washington’s measures have pushed Iran’s economy into deep recession. But they have inflamed a volatile region. They have empowered Iranian hardliners and their militant proxies, while exposing the vulnerabilities of the US’s Gulf partners, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
&gt; 
&gt; While Iran had significantly reduced its nuclear activity under the accord, moreover, Mr Trump’s actions led to Tehran expanding its atomic programme. Today, its stockpile of enriched uranium is 12 times what it was before he abandoned the deal.
&gt; 
&gt; Iran has, however, remained in the accord with the backing of the UK, France, Germany, China and Russia, the deal’s other signatories. While recognising flaws in the nuclear deal and sharing criticisms about Iran’s actions, European powers have deemed it the best tool to prevent a regional arms race and to use as a platform on which to build any future negotiations.
&gt; 
&gt; The EU rightly condemned Fakhrizadeh’s assassination as a “criminal act”. The European signatories must now step up their diplomatic efforts to create a conducive environment to boost the chances of dialogue between Tehran and Washington once the Biden administration takes office. The Iranian regime has vowed revenge for Fakhrizadeh’s killing, but should avoid being goaded into retaliation.
&gt; 
&gt; The nuclear accord failed to tackle many of the concerns western and regional powers harbour about Iran’s malign actions, from militias to missiles. But it provides a far better starting point than the tempestuous Trump years, during which the region perpetually feared it was on the brink of war. Mr Biden’s task was already highly complex. This reckless and dangerous assassination only reinforces the need for dialogue among all parties.

Arguments for guns differ by country. In the US, , saying ""target shooting is fun"" this is a rather weak argument. This is not because it is wrong, but because there are ***far stronger***  arguments for gun ownership based on constitutional rights of the individual.

I'm Canadian. Here, gun ownership is a privledge, so no second amendment for us. Instead, arguments for long gun ownership often center around traditional hunting. Arguments for pistol ownership center around how crimes involving firearms usually involve illegally imported firearms from the US, and how target shooters are not the cause of gun crime. This is a argument that isn't relevant for most countries, since only Canada and Mexico share a border with the US. 

In Europe, ""target shooting is fun"" *may* work as an argument. It likely depends on the culture of the country in question, and whether they have a longstanding history of sport shooting.

No. DV is entirely different in Spain and a level of radicalism you literally wouldn't believe (when I learned about it, I simply didn't believe it could be true I had to ask 6 lawyers if it was true). In fact its policy contravenes the European Human Rights law (see below) but is still allowed

400 false accusations in Spain a day against men

In case your wonder what this is. In Spain the man (only the man, this law does not apply to women on men or women, or men on men) would AUTOMATICALLY be arrested for 48 hours WITHOUT TRIAL and then goto a judge. The woman would then get 400 euros a month (only women). There are 106 courts ONLY for men. The important thing to note is that arrest WITHOUT trial (i.e. guilty UNTIL innocent) is not the normal police procedure of arresting people, it is based SOLELY on the word of the woman (but not the man) so ""yeah he's covered in blood and I look fine, but officer, he hit me... ok arrest the man for 48 hours no trial"") For obvious reasons its highly weaponised in Spain by women... here is a video of a Spanish woman faking her injury caught on video, the idiot didn't realise she doesnt even need to fake an injury she could have just claimed it (see source at end of post for link)

here is a video of man being sentenced - Orwellian!! (see source at end of post):

So in this Spanish gender law, a woman doing the EXACT same thing to a man (or another woman) would not be a crime (it would apply normal legal process)

PHD on it and how it is against human rights:

They had a policy where if a woman claimed DV in a house, she would have the deeds transferred to her (not wife, I mean ANYONE a girl you live with for 2 weeks... your 30 year old house she has nothing to do with would go to her.... again ONLY to a woman, not a man.... this part of it eventually got removed from the law after a few years)

This isnt niche policy... well over 1,000,000 affected. Also it has made domestic violence actually worse then when policy stared in 2004... which isnt a suprise if you try and solve real issues with idalpgical bullshit dogma, thats what happens

**This BTW you should oppose ALL attempts to gender laws and policies... this is feminist/ SJW end game i.e. Spain what they want, it starts with gendering laws which should be gender neutral... e.g. UK decided to add sex to list of hate crime victims (this is not inconsequential, if a crime e.g. verbal abuse is deemed to be hate crime, it has higher sentence).... surprise surprise, feminists VICIOUSLY opposed this, and said specifically not sex, not women, but MISOGYNY should be added, and SPECIFICALLY men should not be added nor should misandry.... thats their start of trying to create a different legal system so crimes against women are different to the exact same crime against men.**

For example: France was one of the biggest military powers in Europe during that time. His generals didn't want _anything_ to do with invading France but Hitler was stubborn so they went ahead with it... and got lucky. Invading France was _obviously_ one of his biggest accomplishments as a ""military strategist"" but again, as I said, everybody else was against the move and he got lucky.

Towards the end of the second World War, it was obvious that Hitler wasn't an intelligent strategist. The Nazis conducted a pretty solid propaganda campaign against Stalin, Russia and communism; all the while, he was murdering innocent civilians and the world was taking notice to this. Stalin became the less of two evils for the rest of the world by the end of the war. He lost support from all sides... that's not what a good strategist would do.

Also, the invasion of Stalingrad. Stalingrad was _leveled_ to dust and rubble by the Luftwaffe bombing runs and morale was low on the Russian side. So, Hitler said: ""Well, go right in, they're weak and running low on everything."" I don't know what his expectations were but sending German troops into the bitter cold of Stalingrad wasn't exactly the smartest move, especially when you know... Russians were used to the cold and the German troops were on very unfamiliar ground. Not even the best meth they could have cooked up in Berlin could have kept their soldiers from freezing to death. It might have been the single dumbest military move that the Nazis could have come up with. And then, after getting into Stalingrad and starting the house-to-house warfare, they actually let the Russian generals assemble troops in the mountains, let them attack their supply line from two sides, _cutting off their whole supply line into Stalingrad_ and then Hitler left the troops for dead. The intelligence portion of the Nazis was _very weak_ and that hadn't just been in Stalingrad, their intelligence gathering had always been weak.

Also, why didn't he _bomb the RAF_? Instead, he decided to bomb Britain to send a message. He had severely crippled the RAF... so he decided to bomb Britain's cities? Instead of completely destroying the Royal Air Force.

So, sure. You could say that Hitler was a ""very good public speaker"" if you don't think about what was going on in Germany before his rise to power. He was a man who took advantage of a country angry about the Treaty of Versailles, which destabilized their economy due to the $33 billion reparations they had to pay. All he did was take advantage of a country in shambles, using his prowess in being an ""elegant speaker"" and turned it into a mass-murdering machine, focused on his vision to create an ethno-regime for the Aryan race.",True,False,False,,,,0,1606834927,,1606835123,0,{},ge9i0t9,False,t3_k4f6bf,False,False,t1_ge8o4wl,/r/LeopardsAteMyFace/comments/k4f6bf/a_poc_who_has_tweeted_some_racist_things_gets/ge9i0t9/,False,,1618064874,4,True,False,LeopardsAteMyFace,t5_3jp3p,r/LeopardsAteMyFace,public,,0,[],

To, verden har ændret sig. EU, Tyskland, Storbritannien, USA, Australien, Sverige, osv. osv. har alle bevæget sig over i en langt mere Kina-kritisk retning. Hvordan ville det se ud, hvis Danmark nu bevægede sig væk fra dem? Specielt, når vores udenrigsminister har været ude og sige, at han gerne vil hjælpe dem i HongKong?

It's always like that, it ends up affecting the low to middle class instead of the million dollar tax cheats. Hell, the US has been prepping up the EU to go after accidental Americans without considering their circumstances, and when they do, it will be sold as having gone after tax cheats - who've been paying taxes in their home countries their whole lives - when what they've are going to do is getting banks to pin the metaphorical Star of David's on the next vulnerable minority in Europe, which seems to now be those ""Americans"" who don't accept that America is #1 by making a life in other countries. Now, not only Germany can join in on the fun, everyone else can.

The rest of the developed world uses residence based taxation, while the US is only joined by Eritria in its Citizen based taxation. Before that, it was joined by the Philippines, but the Philippines made the transition into the modern world in the 20th century. And let's face it, no one reading this comment is going to give a shit, so I'll just leave a link to what seems to make people give a shit nowadays: Entertainment!

[What it's like as an American abroad with Taxes: Double Taxation](https://youtu.be/4l2RDCx2YnA)

And if you look at who's doing the fighting against this, it gets even dirtier, because there are actually corporate interests fostering fake grassroots movements to get FATCA repealed by parading as and misleading those who would try to unite because they are affected by this.

The US does need to go after wealthy tax cheats, but the ""swamp"" won't let it, 40% don't give a shit for ""fake Americans"", and most of the remaining 60% aren't even aware of the near Jim Crow law state of affairs for taxation of Americans residing overseas. But in contrast to Trump, those Americans haven't paid armies of lawyers to cheat themselves legally out of tax by being constantly in debt, so it's pretty easy PR to go after ""wealthy tax cheats"", defining ""wealthy"" as anyone who could have been afforded a plane ticket after they were born and ""tax cheats"" for paying taxes all of their life, but not the appropriate IRS tax form or the appropriate FinnCERN registration for ""foreign accounts"" of the day to day living accounts the use at the place where they've lived (most of) their life.

Don't get your hopes up. Yogi's pick could be Mumbadevi. 

The city’s earliest recorded names are said to be Kakamuchee and Galajunkja, versions of which are still considered to be in use. However, the city was referred to as Manbai in the Mirat-i-Ahmadi, a historical text on Gujarat dating back to 1507 written in [Persian](http://theculturetrip.com/middle-east/iran/) by Ali Muhammad Khan. In Lendas da Índia or the Legends of India, written in old Portuguese by writer [Gaspar Correia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaspar_Correia), the city was referred to as Bombaim, meaning ‘good bay’. ‘Bombay’ is an anglicized version of the [Portuguese](http://theculturetrip.com/europe/portugal/) name used by the British when they took control of the city in the 17th century. Adding to the confusion, historical records indicate that the city was referred to as Mombayn , Bombay, Bombain , Bombaym, Monbaym, Mombaim, Mombaym, Bambaye, Bombaiim, Bombeye, Boon Bay, and Bon Bahia, among other names at different points in its colonial history!

Regardless, ‘Mumbai’ is said to already have been in use in the 16th century by the local Koli fisher-folk community. It is considered to have been derived from the name of the Koli goddess Mumbadevi, considered to be the city’s patron deity and Aai (mother). And so some Marathi, Konkani, Gujarati, and Kannada speakers had been referring to the city as Mumbai even though it was Bambai to Hindi speakers and the rest of the country, and Bombay in official records.",True,False,False,,,,0,1606837617,,False,0,{},ge9n9nw,False,t3_k3zkpt,False,True,t1_ge8ejpl,/r/mumbai/comments/k3zkpt/up_cm_yogi_adityanath_to_visit_mumbai_on_dec_2_to/ge9n9nw/,False,,1618067404,4,True,False,mumbai,t5_2qp4r,r/mumbai,public,,0,[],

1. Big budget team is a good way to start. When I started I actually jumped into a custom/fictional game.  I don't know that many MLB players so I wouldn't have much of an attachment to any of them anyway, in a custom game I felt more attached to my team that way.
2. As mentioned, a GM/Manager role is good as you have the flexibility to delegate tasks to your staff. I would suggest letting the staff handle the lineup, and the player promotions and demotions, even minor league singings.  Baseball is a complicated beast with all its waiver rules and such. You may want the A.I. to handle that, as you handle the staff, trades, contracts. Then learn all the small details of baseball rules.
3. One feature I recommend is ""Shop player"" it can be a HUGE challenge to trade a player by simply looking over an other teams roster.  The A.I. sometimes are just totally unwilling to trade a player.  If you use the Shop player option, you can specify (like in FM2020) what you're looking for in return, a Vet, A rookie, a specific position...  The game will then throw you a list of players from other teams where a trade is compatible.  Its very quick and easy, occasionally you can even get a great deal from it.
4. My challenge in the game is always self driven or narrative driven, I try to keep my team young and competitive and win championships.  I play a custom game and I'm also playing in commissioner mode.  This allows me to modify plenty of settings, in my game I'm adding more European players and talent, I've created a 12 team premiere league in the UK/France/Germany.  Things like that keep my interest going, so i'm not just focused on my team I like to observe what's happening in the baseball world.

Additional advice : Don't be afraid to turn on commissioner mode, this will allow you to edit many aspects of the game but also look at the raw stats and details of players.  (Or change some if you need)  Its honestly a good way to understand how the game is running.   Like in FM2020 where you can hide players ratings in OOTP you can do the game, but also keep in mind the ratings presented to you are a prediction from your scout.  In commissioner mode you can look at the honest raw numbers of a player which influences his ratings.  This might just help you understand better how the OOTP ratings are done.

&amp;#x200B;

Since you're a FootballManager guy, I played that this past weekend to try and get into that game, I have a good understanding of soccer, played a lot of fifa, played soccer my entire life, but that game seems very intimidating in regards of staff management and roster management.  I'm having a hard time getting into it.  Plus when you click continue I always feel I'm being interrupted with little actions to take. It felt like in 8 hours of playing I only went through 3 friendlies.   If you have some advice on how to get better immersed into FM2020 let  me know.      With that comment, in OOTP check you manager settings you can change the number of notifications that pops up as you play, injuries, trades, events.  Some show up as mail some will stop the simulation and ask you to do something/react.

I've hardly committed to that, it will likely take years to get approved. Especially with Covid.

[],,tnecniv2357,,,,[],,,,text,t2_3j61bbgp,False,False,[],"Om vi pladdrar runt i ölen lite till då - systembolaget har överlag ett större utbud på importerad öl från mindre västeuropeiska, tjeckiska och Amerikanska bryggerier än en gemen dagligvarubutik, ja. På en fri marknad skulle man behöva importera en del av de säsongsvaror som vi kan spontanhandla på systemet, det sätter jag inte emot. Men om det är argumentet för att vi ska ha ett monopol med sina avigsidor, räcker det ur mitt perspektiv inte att sortimentet i butik är måttligt bättre än i dagligvaruhandeln och möjligtvis marginellt bättre än motsvarande köpupplevelse på nät/postorder.

Hade verkligheten varit att systembolaget kunnat överglänsa den fria marknaden med vettiga priser på ett gediget ölutbud från danska, polska, estniska, japanska, ryska, bolivianska, argentinska, australiensiska och sydkoreanska småbryggerier som försöker ge sig in på en hårt exploaterad marknad - då hade jag kunnat hålla med om att det hade varit gynnsamt för oss svenskar som tycker om spännande öl. Men detta är ju inte monopolets egentliga uppdrag.

När vi ändå är inne på ölen och den fria marknaden kontra monopolet, innebär vårt nuvarande system att lokala mikrobryggerier måste komma upp i en högre produktionskapacitet för att kunna leva upp till bolagets krav för att deras öl ska kunna säljas, vilket gör att det finns en högre investeringströskel för att starta mikrobryggeri som kan sälja öl i Sverige. Detta gynnar främst stora aktörer (Carlsberg) som driver småskalig produktion i underbolag, framför små oberoende aktörer. Detta ger en fördel till små utländska aktörer med friare marknad, vilket i sin tur gör att mer nischad öl med fördel produceras utanför Sverige än inom landets gränser.

Det med att peka på monopolets fina sortiment i butik utan att ta hänsyn till övriga faktorer är i min mening som att pissa i byxorna för att hålla benen varma i vinterkylan. Funkar jättebra på kort sikt, men man stinker av piss och efter några minuter fryser man mer än från början då fuktiga byxor leder värme/kyla bättre än torra.

De små discountbutikerna i DK, framförallt Netto, har större rotation på sina varor och fler lokala varor än vad vi är vana vid i svenska butiker. Där går man in om man vet att de har ett bra erbjudande, ska ha något snabbt och billigt (smör, mjölk, bröd, choklad) eller har minsta känsla för spontanitet och improvisation (ofta är det väldigt vettiga råvaror till ett bra pris). Detta gäller även ölen.

Ce urmează e mult text dar o să încerc să scriu cât mai pe scurt.

Dragonii bărboși sunt șopârle de dimensiuni medii aș spune eu, diurne și foarte prietenoase. Sunt pline de personalitate, iar la maturitate sunt majoritar erbivore. Vin din deșertul australian așa că habitatul lor trebuie să fie similar.

În casă se ține :) mai precis în terariu. Al meu e încă puiuț, la 4 luni și 24cm, pe la un an ar trebui să aibe între 40-60cm dar cam jumătate din lungime e coada.

Terariul la un pui poate să fie și 60x45x45cm, dar la un adult o să ai nevoie de ceva mai lung, aș zice unul de cel puțin 90cm. Eu personal vreau să-i fac unul de 120 când va fi mare.

Poți să-l mai scoți din terariu să stea și cu tine, dar are nevoie și de mediul lui acolo.

O să ai nevoie de lampa de căldură, și sub ea un loc unde se poate încălzi, ca o piatră. Temperatura sub lampă e ok la 40°C la adulți, la pui între 40-43°C.

În partea cealaltă a terariului (deoarece ai nevoie de un gradient de căldură) pot să fie între 21-24°C, temperatura camerei obișnuită. Noaptea să ai grijă să nu scadă sub 18. Dacă ai probleme cu temperatura prea mică, nu ține becurile aprinse, ia un încălzitor de ceramică. E ca un bec care dă doar căldură, fără lumină.

O să ai nevoie de becul UVB. E foarte important, fără el șopârla se va îmbolnăvi. Un UVB tub (ca un neon) e mai bun ca unul compact de obicei, trebuie să fie de putere 10.0 oricum. Le găsești pe net sau magazine de animale. Să nu uiți că trebuie schimbate, chiar dacă ele se aprind după 6 luni sau un an (depinde de model, scrie pe cutie) vor rămâne fără raze UVB. Partea bună e că poți să te bronzezi și tu la asemenea bec :))

Becurile se țin aprinse doar ziua, între 10-14h pe zi în funcție de anotimp.

Umiditatea ar trebui să fie foarte scăzută, sub 40%, de aceea un bol cu apă nu prea e recomandat. De cele mai multe ori dragonii nu beau apă stătătoare oricum, ei își iau apa din mâncare.

În terariu o să aibe nevoie și de ascunzători (precum acele pietre goale pe dinăuntru), crengi pe care se cățăra etc. Poți chiar să ai și unele plante vii! (Fasolea e ok de exemplu)

Lăsând terariul la o parte, dragonul va mânca insecte și plante verzi. Insectele vor trebui să fie vii, găsești de cumpărat la magazinele de animale dar îți recomand să iei de la oamenii care vând pe olx, mai ieftin și sunt mai de încredere. Dubia, pallida, orientalis, majoritatea tipurilor de gândăcei sunt ok pentru ei. Dubia sunt cel mai ușor de ținut totuși. Când vine vorba de viermișori, phoenix worms sunt okay, superwoms mai mult ca dulciuri că sunt foarte grași.

Păpădie, rucola, dovlecel sunt plante pe care le pot mânca zilnic. Sunt o grămadă de lucruri pe care le pot mânca, o să-ți las surse la care să te uiți. Să nu le dai avocado sau insecte găsite pe afară (ori prin casă) niciodată.

Când vine vorba de personalitate, dragonii nu mușcă. Doar dacă îi dai mâncare cu mâna s-ar putea să rateze mâncarea, dar nu e nimic grav. Când sunt supărați ei își închid la culoare barba, de aici și numele. Când sunt pui fac dungi pe burtă și pe barbă când sunt supărați.

Însă ține minte că ei își schimbă culoarea și în funcție de temperatură.

Sunt multe de spus și nu știu dacă tu vrei să îți iei de pui sau un adult, dar îți recomand următoare surse:

De asemenea, r/BeardedDragons are și un Discord cu multe informații, dar sunt și ghiduri pe sub

În final o să-ți recomand să-ți iei un mascul dacă îl vrei doar ca animal de casă, pentru că femelele vor depune ouă și fără mascul. Vor fi infertile dar va trebui să ai grijă de ea să nu facă carență de calciu, să aibe unde să le depună, să nu rămână în interiorul ei și mai multe.

Things will develop that make speaking and mentally processing language easier for speakers. Gender is essentially just a way of classifying nouns into categories, which can make it easier in determining their roles in a sentence, for example, in cases where English would only have ""it"" available (so imagine a sentence like ""the dog chased the cat. It had a black tail""; what is ""it"" referring to here? A language with gender might be able to make it clear which animal is being referred to). Our minds like categorisation and metaphor, it makes conceptualising things easier. This is reflected in our language. George Lakoff wrote an good book about this called *Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things* if you're interested.

&gt;when you have a group of mixed genders you use the male form

Keep in mind that the ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" noun classes could literally be called anything. You could call them ""black"" and ""white"" and it would have the same function. It's just because male and female *sex* happens to correlate between the two classes that they are called that in European languages.

Clearly, people from outside America ARE interested in American murder stories otherwise I don't think we'd be having this discussion on this sub. Sure, most people aren't interested in true crime at all. But for those that are, who seek out this sub, hard to avoid that most of the content is going to be from America. That's just the userbase of the website. It's just true that the US exports a lot of media, including true crime media, and a significant amount of media is consumed in English. 

I said in another comment that I absolutely do not think racial and ethnic diversity has anything to do with the disparity in murder rates. Most murders are intra-racial, not inter-racial. Nothing in my above comment implies that I think all germans have the same ethnic makeup. I know they do not. That's why I hate the other comment that implies that Germany being more ""homogeneous"" and the US being more racially diverse is the cause of the homicide disparity. That is obviously untrue. 

My point was about ECONOMIC stratification. If you break down US homicide rates by state, you will see that wealthier states have murder rates that are on par with European countries like Germany or Denmark. States like Louisiana and New Mexico, where extreme poverty is prevalent, have much, much higher homicide rates.

Well, it all depends on whether or not mass storage facilities like those in France work or not.  If it ends up working, then yes, Nuclear is feasible.  If it leaks, or gets blown up, or some other unforseen consequence happens... then no, it will not have been worth it, and might destroy Europe's habitability for thousands of years.

I think fusion power, and researching proper disposal, or even use of nuclear waste are the ways forward.  I don't necessarily think continuing to pump out nuclear waste, which may in time prove to more harmful than global warming itself, is a good idea.

It's a risk.  Global warming has a chance of being solved with carbon capture, and various other technologies.  Nuclear Waste has a chance of being solved as well.  

The worst case scenario would be that in 10 years we discover carbon capture technology that makes reversing global warming possible, and we find out that storing nuclear waste is even more problematic than we previously thought, and that long term safe storage isn't possible, and the current facilities need to be emptied(or god forbid they find out too late, after they've already massively leaked).  It's sort of a coin flip.

The GBE will operate a points-based system, where points are scored for senior and talented young players.

They will be based on: 1) Senior and youth international appearances. 2) Quality of the selling club, based on the league they are in, league position and progression in continental competition. 3) Club appearances, based on domestic league and continental competition minutes.

Players accumulating the requisite amount of points will earn a GBE (Governing Body Endorsement) automatically, while players just below the threshold may be considered for a GBE by an Exceptions Panel.

In the Premier League, the number of overseas U21 players a club can sign will be limited to 3 in the January transfer window and 6 per season moving forwards.

&gt; 
&gt; “Operation Condor pursued many types of political opponents, including congressional representatives, former ministers, human rights advocates (including people in Amnesty International), constitutionalist military officers, peasant leaders, unionists, priests and nuns, professors and students,” says J. Patrice McSherry, professor emerita of political science at Long Island University. “Condor targeted not only the Left, but also the center-left and other democratic sectors that were fighting to demand their rights and make more inclusive the elitist democracies of the era.”
&gt; 
&gt; “First, the aim was to stop terrorism,” one operative from the Department of National Intelligence (DINA), Chile’s feared secret police, explained. “Then possible extremists were targeted, and later those who might be converted into extremists.” Or, as one Argentine general put it: “First we will kill all the subversives; then we will kill their collaborators; then their sympathizers; then those who are indifferent.”
&gt; 
&gt; Though this was supposed to be justified by the dire threat of left-wing violence, it’s hard to take such a threat seriously today. Not only were the Condor governments targeting individuals who were peaceful or unconnected to any revolutionary movements, but those movements had largely been defeated or even given up on armed struggle. As Shlaudeman put it to Henry Kissinger in 1976: “Both terrorists and the peaceful left have failed. This is true even in the minds of studious revolutionaries.” Fernando Lopez has [argued](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Feathers_of_Condor/1uj6DAAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;bsq=fernando%20lopez%20military%20regimes%20grossly%20overstated%20the%20threat%20posed%20by%20the%20revolutionary%20movements&amp;dq=fernando%20lopez%20military%20regimes%20grossly%20overstated%20the%20threat%20posed%20by%20the%20revolutionary%20movements&amp;pg=PR10&amp;printsec=frontcover) that the regimes “grossly overstated the threat posed by the revolutionary movements” so they could go after their real target: the opposition in exile, who drew global sympathy and solidarity, and isolated the Condor governments internationally.
&gt; 
&gt; [Image](https://images.jacobinmag.com/2016/10/17230901/letelier1-1.jpg)Orlando Letelier, killed by a car bomb in Washington, DC, in 1976. (The Transnational Institute)Their plans weren’t confined to the continent. Twelve of the victims of cross-border operations came from countries outside of the region, including the UK, Italy, France, and the United States, while some of the most high-profile targets were assassinated in European countries, making Condor not just a transnational operation, but a global one. As exiled left-wing and moderate opponents of Pinochet’s dictatorship planned to campaign for diplomatic isolation of the country, he plotted to take them out.
&gt; 
&gt; Agents of DINA planned attacks in Portugal and France, and tried repeatedly to kill Carlos Altamirano, general secretary of the Socialist Party of Chile: once in Mexico, when they showed up too late; several times in Paris, when they were foiled by French intelligence; and once in Madrid, where the attempt failed. Bernardo Leighton, the founder of Chile’s Christian Democrat Party, may not have been a radical — he opposed much of Allende’s program — but he was guilty of meeting with Socialist leaders to form an opposition front of exiles against the regime. He survived a gunshot to the back of the head in Rome, but was left with permanent brain damage, ending his opposition activities.
&gt; 
&gt; While Pinochet took a leading role, the targets weren’t just Chilean. Scotland Yard prevented the assassination of Uruguayan senator Wilson Ferreira Aldunate in London, while then-representative Edward Koch, later to become mayor of New York City, was warned by then-CIA director George H. W. Bush that there was a threat on his life, thanks to his successful amendment to end US military aid to Uruguay. In Buenos Aires, two Uruguayan legislators and two activists were kidnapped in the early morning and later found with shots to the head in a car left under a bridge. Meanwhile, as journalist John Dinges has pointed out, a slew of seemingly natural deaths in a few short years of opponents in exile of the continent’s various dictatorships raises further suspicions.
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps the most famous victim of Condor was [Orlando Letelier](https://jacobinmag.com/2016/09/orlando-letelier-pinochet-nixon-kissinger), Allende’s former ambassador to the United States. After being detained and tortured by the regime following the coup, diplomatic pressure allowed Letelier to escape and eventually return to Washington, DC, where he soon became one of the most visible and influential members of Chile’s opposition to exile. Set up in the heart of American power and hobnobbing with US officials and their families, Letelier led a successful legislative campaign to ban US arms sales to Chile, lobbied against a $63 million investment by a Dutch company into the country, and fiercely criticized Pinochet’s free-market economic reforms.
&gt; 
&gt; All of it made him a marked man. In 1976, two DINA agents entered the United States on passports from Paraguay, a fellow Condor member, and with the help of two exiled Cuban anti-communists, rigged a bomb to Letelier’s car that detonated right on DC’s Embassy Row, killing him and one of his two American passengers. Until September 11, 2001, it would remain the worst act of foreign terrorism on US soil.
&gt; 
&gt;   For years, the official story was that the US government learned about Condor roughly around the same time as everyone else, in 1976. In fact, through declassifications, firsthand testimony, and the work of historians, we now know that this program of state terror had been sanctioned, facilitated, and encouraged by the US government.
&gt; 
&gt; Contrary to its denials at the time, a CIA report produced for Congress in 2000 would admit that “within a year after the [1973 Chilean] coup, the CIA and other US government agencies were aware of bilateral cooperation among regional intelligence services to track the activities of and, in at least a few cases, kill political opponents” — a “precursor” to Condor. Consider, too, that Manuel Contreras, the ruthless DINA chief knee-deep in Condor, was a (at one point, paid) [CIA asset](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/news/20000919/01-16.htm) from 1974 to 1977, despite an internal 1975 report [finding him](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/news/20000919/01-17.htm) “the principal obstacle to a reasonable human rights policy within the junta.”
&gt; 
&gt; For decades, speculation has abounded about just how unintentionally oblivious segments of the US government really were to the Letelier operation specifically. Despite being [repeatedly alerted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1980/06/29/the-unresolved-questions-in-the-letelier-case/f70e1f2a-159f-492d-9a2a-a1f74d6d3430/) to the DINA agents’ attempts to enter the United States, and its suspicious nature, the CIA did nothing. A mere five days before they killed Letelier, Kissinger [backpedaled an order](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB514/docs/Doc%2005%20-%2091cd.pdf) for US ambassadors in a handful of the Condor countries to express the US government’s “deep concerns” over the reported plans of overseas assassination. Earlier that year, Pinochet had [personally complained](http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB212/19760608%20US-Chilean%20Relations.pdf) to Kissinger about Letelier’s activities, in a conversation in which Kissinger assured the dictator that “we are sympathetic with what you are trying to do.”
&gt; 
&gt; But worse, evidence uncovered by figures like McSherry and Dinges suggest the US government wasn’t just aware of the crimes of Condor, but directly involved in them.
&gt; 
&gt; Archival documents show the CIA, FBI, and even US embassies providing intelligence and names of suspects to the Condor governments, with both hemispheres looking into suspects on their home turf at the other’s behest. That included Fuentes, the results of whose interrogation (including the names he gave up) the US embassy in Buenos Aires relayed to Chilean police. Contreras himself later insisted, in court and to reporters, that the CIA had been involved in both the murder of Letelier and Carlos Prats, the former Chilean general blown up in Argentina a year before Condor’s founding, and that he had given the FBI documents proving his claims in 2000.

It was my mistake for not inquiring more about him - she seldom mentioned him, but when we first were together, he was trying to contact her and she blocked him. She admitted that she unblocked him and began reacting to his ig stories 4 months or so before the breakup (we were together just over a year), but in the month or two prior to the break up, had began talking to him a lot - mainly about relationships and such.

I reckon it was because I was bogged down with two jobs and did not skype with her as much in the last month - i was blind to see that she was retracting and assumed there was nothing wrong (we were about to live together for 2 months).

The key person of Dominion Voting are all related to The Carlyle Group. The Carlyle Group is an American multinational private equity, alternative asset management and financial services corporation, with more than $203 billion in assets under management.

His deputy is James Baker III, who was US Secretary of State under George Bush senior. The financial assets of the Saudi Binladen Corporation (SBC) are also managed by the Carlyle Group.

Vreau sa spun din prima ca nu stiu cat de calificat sunt eu sa dau sfaturi insa voi incerca sa-ti dau macar cateva idei.

In primul rand daca te intereseaza partea de backend presupun ca as putea veni si eu cu cateva idei din moment ce cochetez si eu cu domeniul asta. La partea de backend depinde mult unde vrei sa lucrezi. Eu personal am inceput cu PHP si apoi am continuat cu un framework de PHP numit Laravel (un fel de colectie de coduri scrise in PHP care te ajuta sa dezvolti mai rapid un website). Acum PHP e usor de invatat si gasesti mult continut pentru el insa nu stiu daca e cea mai interesanta alegere pentru angajare. Mai degraba ar fi pentru ceva freelance work as zice. Dar ca limbaje de referinta peste care sa te uiti pentru backend ar fi, Java daca vrei sa lucrezi in corporatii mari, NodeJS este iar o alegere interesanta, Python chiar desi este ceva mai restrans ca popularitate insa are doua framework-uri pentru partea de backend (Django si Flask). Din toate astea probabil Java iti va oferi cele mai multe variante de angajare. Ca idee, odata ce inveti cum sa faci o chestie intr-un limbaj, o sa iti fie foarte usor sa sari in alt limbaj si sa faci fix aceeasi operatiune, ideile sunt mai greu de invatat de principiu.

Daca vrei sa te angajezi iti recomand si o facultate. Pe langa ca iti ofera ghidare, te pune si sa incerci mai multe chestii, poate cine stie, mai descoperi ceva ce iti place. In plus reprezinta un avantaj atunci cand te angajezi mai ales la inceput. Singura chestie ar fi, daca nu vrei niciodata sa te angajezi presupun ca ai putea sa dai skip la facultate. Dar doar cu conditia sa fii 100% convins ca viitorul tau nu e ca angajat si ca freelancer sau antreprenor in domeniu. Nu ca nu te-ai putea angaja si fara facultate, insa iti va fi mai greu. Sau daca esti bun nu neaparat mai greu, dar vei da inca un motiv angajatorului sa te plateasca mai putin si nu cred ca vrei sa lucrezi la fel de mult ca un coleg cu facultate dar sa iei mai putini bani la final de luna.

Cat despre ce se face la facultate, eu sunt la AC anul 3, si as zice ca nu faci chiar atat de multa fizica si mate cat sa fie problema. Adica da, o sa ai materii mai ales in primul an si jumtate, dupa se vor mai rari. Dar daca chiar vrei sa faci o facultate sunt sigur ca vei reusi sa treci cu putina chinuiala si de materiile alea. Acum eu sunt la politehnica prin urmare se va face mai multa mate si fizica decat spre exemplu la info. Deci daca mergi acolo ar trebui sa ai sa zic 90% din materii orientate mai degraba spre partea de info. De notat ca am zis partea de info si nu partea de backend, adica nu o sa legi tu fire pe placute poate, dar asta nu inseamna ca vei face fix ce iti place tie, vei face si multe chestii care nu iti vor trezi interesul (asta apare la absolut orice facultate). Insa vreau sa iti zic sa nu iti fie rusine de ce facultate alegi. Sau sa te iei dupa alti oameni care zic vai facultatea aia e naspa nu merge acolo. Mergi unde crezi tu ca iti va placea. Ti-o spun eu care nu neaparat ca am fost influentat de altii sa merg la AC insa nu as fi vrut sa nu intru la AC ca ma gandeam ca daca nu intru aici inseamna ca nu sunt suficient de inteligent. Ulterior abia am descoperit ca facultatea la care mergi nu e neaparat un indicator pentru cat de inteligent esti.

Daca vrei sa mergi in SUA iti recomand totusi sa te orientezi pentru o universitate acolo. Este scump intradevar, e mai complicat si asa mai departe dar e mai bine sa te scolarizeze mediul in care vrei sa activezi. Nu ca nu ai putea sa te angajezi in SUA venind din Romania insa presupun ca da mai bine sa termini ceva de acolo decat sa termini ceva din Romania. Si cred sincer ca decat sa faci o facultate in Romania si dupa sa iti cauti de lucru acolo mai bine incepi sa lucrezi tu, sa iti faci proiecte personale si sa incerci asa sa gasesti un job in America decat sa le arati alora ca ai terminat ceva facultate de care ei nu au auzit in viata lor (asta e parerea mea nu am lucrat niciodata in America, nu cunosc piata muncii acolo si nu sunt in masura sa dau sfaturi in legatura cu asta)

La final vreau sa iti recomand canalul meu de YouTube unde gasesti cateva clipuri despre cum e facultatea in romania, mai exact AC Iasi, poate iti ofera niste idei:

I think in this case the interviewer comes out and uses the instance in Poland to then ask if the Pinkertons are performing similar tasks here in the US.

In general once they have been observed doing boss/company bidding abroad questions are immediately going to pop up about their activities in the states. Thinking on this track it becomes very easy to tie it back into what the group is most famous for: squashing labor organizing during a time when Amazon is facing increasing scrutiny over its labor practices.

- Think about what aspects of drug policy you're interested in working on. Decriminalising simple possession? Safer consumption centres? Regulation  of psychedelics? Cannabis markets? Access to essential medicines in developing countries? The human rights of affected populations? They're all relevant in drug policy, but all very different. Understanding drug policy and what aspects of it you want to influence are more important (at least initially) than legal knowledge. It will also help you identify those organisations that you are interested in working for or with. Drug policy is a broad church; we tend to think of drug policy reformers as liberal - it isn't always the case, and you don't want to end up working for an organisation that isn't aligned with your views
- Don't necessarily chuck the day job just yet. There aren't that many neat and tidy 'drug policy lawyer' jobs out there. Most people working in the field are other things as well, or first - academic lawyers, NGO service providers and so on. Unless you *really* want away from corporate law, consider dipping your toe first - see if you can volunteer some CSR days to work on drug policy issues. This will also help you see what kind of work is going on in the field. In terms of volunteering, as others have said - if you're in the US, DPA is a good place to start your investigations
- Think also about what kind of work you want to do. Drug policy reform tends to be advocacy in the broad sense - legal work is part of it, but so is managing messaging, understanding stakeholders and a million other things. Think lobbying, more than the representation of clients in court, if that makes sense. Strategic litigation is where it gets adversarial as opposed to advisory - there are a couple of organisations in North America doing this type of stuff - taking cases, filing amicus briefs and so on. ACLU also do some work in the area
- Like others said, if you can get to one of the big conferences post-pandemic, they're great networking events - you'd get to meet loads of people, etc.

Run G28 to auto home, and then run G29 to ABL.  When it's done with ABL, it will spit out a small grid of numbers.  Take those, and paste them into the text area on http://lokspace.eu/3d-printer-auto-bed-leveling-mesh-visualizer/. 

You'll notice that the sample data on that visualizer has 12 columns and 12 rows (meaning that the example is sampling 144 plot points).  The CR-6 SE only does 16 by default, so your mesh data will be a lot smaller (4 columns and rows).  Just paste it in, then click Visualize.

It's easy to see where 0,0 is, and since that's the front-left of your printer, you'll be able to see where the mesh data from the ABL shows dips and rises.  Remember that these are (or should be) sub-millimeter distances.  .1mm isn't going to be a huge deal, but it's still nice to get it completely level.  

At this point, you're just following the instructions over on [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CR6/comments/j21de3/leveling_issues_solved_finally/).  What happens is that when you run ABL and grab the mesh data, it's showing you that it's off.  If the screws under the glass plate are snug, and the eccentric nuts are tight enough that the bed doesn't move when touched by the nozzle, then the main thing to check is going to be that x-gantry to make sure it's as square to the bed as possible.  That's what the mesh data is going to tell you: with rises and dips, either the gantry is off or the bed isn't perfectly level (and has some small differences in smoothness).

So when you adjust the z-screws, you're attempting to get it flat.  Get it flat, and if you STILL have issues, then it's likely your bed has some warpage in it, which shouldn't be a huge deal as that's the exact thing ABL is going to deal with for you.  

Just be sure you're not throwing the x-gantry out of whack by having the z-screws off-kilter, because then you'll have issues when it tries to raise along Z (it'll get hung up and make crunchy noises).",True,False,False,,,,0,1606854403,,1606854627,0,{},geamtit,False,t3_k4lprx,False,True,t1_ge9v0h0,/r/CR6/comments/k4lprx/auto_bed_leveling_does_nothing/geamtit/,False,,1618084209,2,False,False,CR6,t5_2mt9ul,r/CR6,public,,0,[],

You don't need perfect adoption to make a major impact, particularly when we're going to be supply-constrained on the vaccine next year anyways.

Then explain to me why the same ultra-wealthy families that partook in the Bolshevik Revolution still hold an Oligarchy over entire industries in that country? 

&gt; In history, communist revolutions have always killed or exiled all of the old elites, even if they then imposed a totalitarian dictatorship after that with new elites. 

And historically, the “old elites” who supported the revolution and facilitated the transition of power have largely grown in power, wealth, and status as a result. Look at China - the same families that have held wealth in that country since the Qing dynasty are now some of the most prominent and wealthy members of the CCP because they partook in the revolution. 

&gt; Certainly currently leftist movements are not friendly to billionaires having billions or the 1% like this CEO. 

Yes they are - why do you think they’re supported by many of the ultra-wealthy? “We’ll protect you because you’re one of the good ones” is the ultimate position for someone looking for unfettered control and zero competition. 

&gt; And democratic socialist countries in Europe have much higher taxes on the wealthy and lower inequality (see GINI ratios or Capital in the 21st century). 

The US has one of the most progressive tax systems in the world so.. no, not really. 

&gt; And if you look at socialism in theory there isn't even capital to own privately.

Right, because “the people” (I.e the government) own it all

&gt;  
&gt;Fears that the finance powerhouse that emerged from Margaret Thatcher’s 1986 deregulation -- known as the Big Bang -- will gradually be dismantled have deepened with a recent flurry of announcements about some business heading to the European Union as Britain enters the last month of the Brexit transition period without a financial-services deal in sight.  
&gt;  
&gt;The latest shift came Monday at 8 a.m., when London Stock Exchange Group Plc’s stock trading platform Turquoise Europe went live in Amsterdam. It joins other trading venues like Cboe Europe and Aquis Exchange Plc setting up shop on the continent as part of their no-deal Brexit plans, a contrast with the late 1980s, which ushered in a period where London became the place to be for equities trading.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The City of London has been thrown to the lions,” said Alasdair Haynes, chief executive officer at Aquis, adding that the U.K. could lose even more stock trading than it expects if giant U.S. asset managers like BlackRock Inc. decide to trade in Paris and Amsterdam.  
&gt;  
&gt;Last week, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said it had applied to French regulators to open its SIGMA X Europe stock platform in Paris from Jan 4. Goldman partner Elizabeth Martin said that she expects most of the 8.6 billion euros ($10 billion) a day in London-based European share trading to shift to the bloc.  
&gt;  
&gt;Europe Calling London venues currently have a 30% share of trading in European stocks  
&gt;  
&gt;Source: Cboe Global Markets  
&gt;  
&gt;Aquis has already established a platform in the French capital. It went live with more than 1,700 European shares earlier this month. Other trading venues like Liquidnet have outposts in Dublin to ensure they can service clients.  
&gt;  
&gt;“We are expecting a big bang on Jan. 4,” said David Howson president of Cboe Europe, the largest of London’s stock trading platforms, which opened its own venue in the Dutch capital last year. “The industry has never had to move this much flow overnight.”  
&gt;  
&gt;It’s not just stock dealing that’s shifting. Brussels disappointed London swap traders last week when its markets regulator said that derivatives need to change hands on EU-based platforms from January. That means trillions of dollars of trades are at risk of being transacted outside of the U.K.  
&gt;  
&gt;Land Grab The bloc has already made a land grab for London’s euro swaps clearing business, urging its banks to accelerate a shift to Europe. Deutsche Boerse AG’s Eurex Clearing has built up a 19% share of the business over recent years although it is dwarfed by London’s market share.  
&gt;  
&gt;In recent weeks, Goldman and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. have indicated that between them more than 300 staff will move to continental cities. Goldman is shifting as much as $60 billion in assets to Frankfurt, while JPMorgan is moving about $230 billion to the German city.  
&gt;  
&gt;Consultancy EY said in a new report Monday that only 10% of big financial services firms are planning to establish or expand operations in the U.K. in the coming year, discouraged by the uncertainties of Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic. That’s down from 45% in April.  
&gt;  
&gt;Foreign Investment in U.K. Finance Set to Drop on Covid, Brexit  
&gt;  
&gt;EY said in a report last month that the 7,500 roles and 1.2 trillion pounds ($1.6 trillion) in assets that have moved already may just be the beginning. It expects further shifts in personnel and assets once the U.K.’s transition period officially ends.  
&gt;  
&gt;That bodes ill for the U.K., where finance employs more than one million people, makes up about 7% of the economy and accounts for more than a 10th of all tax revenue. Despite that, the industry has garnered little of the attention bestowed on fishing, which makes up just 0.1% of the U.K. economy, in the protracted Brexit negotiations.  
&gt;  
&gt;“There is a sense of frustration” that the City is being left behind by the government in key Brexit talks, Lord Mayor of London William Russell said in an interview Monday. “It is disappointing.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Talent Pool To be sure, London’s long-standing advantages of the English language and legal system and a deep talent pool mean it won’t be overtaken anytime soon. And a last-minute agreement with the EU on financial services could still happen.  
&gt;  
&gt;The LSE said it would call off its plan for Turquoise Europe if the European Union declared that Britain can host trading services for EU shares, part of a process known as equivalence. Such an agreement remains a possibility.  
&gt;  
&gt;How ‘Equivalence’ Holds Key to Post-Brexit Banking: QuickTake  
&gt;  
&gt;But time is running out. And without an agreement London’s status as Europe’s financial hub will no longer be in its hands.

    A Struggle for Identity in a Forgotten Corner of Europe
Amid the ghosts of the past empires, residents of Gagauzia fight poverty and a loss of tradition to maintain their culture.

THE QUESTION OF independence has hung over the Moldovan region of Gagauzia for decades. Though its people are desperately poor and rely on agriculture to survive, they cherish their language and culture deeply. Their lives are governed by the land but their hearts are governed by a yearning for identity.

The little-known region is small, with just three towns and a population of 160,000, and was formed out of a 19th century rivalry between the Ottoman and Russian empires. The flat, bucolic landscape comes alive in spring and summer but in winter, the people retreat into hibernation. Pebrel witnessed how drastically the arc and rhythm of their lives changed as the seasons drifted. “It is a harsh winter,” he says. “It gets down to minus 10 or 15 degrees-celsius. Nobody is on the streets. They stay at home and wait for spring to arrive so they can start working in the fields again.”

Pebrel’s intention for the project was to try and understand the Gagauzian identity. The Gagauz are a unique blend of ethnically Turkic and Christian Orthodox, though religion is “not their driving force”. Their food has traces of Turkish influence and there are hints of Balkan style in the way they dress but it is their language - which originates from the Oghuz branch of the Turkic family - that is the remaining, distinguishing ingredient. To this day, very few Gagauzs speak Moldovan, choosing instead to speak Gagauzian or Russian.

European leaders are on record saying that their days of following America's lead are over regardless of who won in 2020.  The damage to USA's standing in the world is enduring, and the above explains why.

I do not understand how those who hoped to ""make America great again"" (which I've always assumed to harken back to the post-WWII days) can see that goal as being compatible with America abandoning its place as a primary actor on the world stage, breaking multiple treaties with allied powers, and allowing fascist powers like Russia and China to step in and increase their roles as global leaders. 

What was it that made America great, if not being a trusted champion for Democracy on the world stage--which very much included things like providing supplies to aid Stalin on the western front, sending critical support to England in stopping the Nazi's at the English Channel and then getting massively involved on the eastern front to defeat fascist Germany, and forming the UN to halt further fascist aggression?

My own experience goes like this: 

Pay lawyer or agent to help draft contract / review it:

- Both buying and selling parties put 10% guarantee of the value in escrow. (you get a bank guarantee easily if you have money in your account to back it up)

- Initial 30 days any party can back out of the deal for any reason and inspections and bank loan can be negotiated.

- After initial 30 days - if either party backs out, they forfeit the 10% to the other party as damages.

- After initial 30 days - if bank rejects you then you are kind of fucked and lost the money... so back out if you don't get the loan in time and can't extend the period.

- The time period can be extended on negotiation.

- Price is fixed when signing the contract - you and they can't renegotiate (not a problem since either can back out initial 30 days)

I am a native of New Jersey, in the US. Western NJ, so I have some roots in eastern PA, as well. My family has an accent that is a little Trenton, a little Philadelphia, and a little of its own. We do NOT sound like Snooky of ""Jersey Shore"". Actually, very few New Jerseyans do.

I have traveled quite a bit in my life, spending some time in California and in Taiwan R.O.C. When I was 24, I met my Czech husband, originally from Prague. His friend, after meeting me, said I sounded a little like someone from New England. Obviously, there are various accents from there, but I think he noted that I enunciated my words more than most. I had been an ESL teacher, so that made sense.

After many years living alone with my Czech husband, I have picked up some of his accent. Particularly a more rolling ""R"" sound. I've had people in New Jersey say they thought I was a European, perhaps a little because of my accent, but also just association with my husband. It does sting a little to have New Jerseyans say I don't sound like a New Jerseyan. Czechs certainly don't say I sound like a Czech.

My husband and I will be moving to Czech Republic at the end of the month. I have a lot of work to do to improve my Czech language skills. My ear for languages is generally good, but there are some Czech words I struggle to pronounce perfectly. For example, the word ""těžký"", which means ""heavy"" or ""difficult"".

My Prague native husband has lived in the US for well over 30 years (he came to the US when he was 28 years old). There have been Czechs who've said ""You speak really good Czech"", assuming he's a native born American who learned Czech. That bugs him, a little. Also, we're moving to the city of Brno, in south Moravia. There is a slightly different accent there, than in Prague. So, both my husband and I will seem like outsiders. My husband is also a little out of touch with some newer Czech terms, and has a propensity to literally translate English/American expressions into Czech. However, my Czech sister-in-law has humorously adopted them, so maybe Czechs will be saying, in Czech, that their ""socks were knocked off"" or that they ""put something on the back burner"" to put off doing it.",True,False,False,,,,0,1606860426,,False,0,{},geazm6r,False,t3_k2zcx4,False,True,t3_k2zcx4,/r/expat/comments/k2zcx4/indiscernible_accent_in_native_language_the/geazm6r/,False,,1618090154,1,True,False,expat,t5_2qsu1,r/expat,public,,0,[],

Edit: Found it

&gt;But the EU has recently given ground on some points in the talks relating to trade in goods, including on customs facilitations and steps to facilitate roll-on roll-off freight crossing the Dover-Calais short straits. Brussels has also softened some of its demands for how much of a good must be locally produced for it to qualify for tariff-free trade.

Nederlands Indië was er geen voorbeeld van, maar Suriname en de Antillen weer wel. Uiteindelijk bepalen tal van factoren, waaronder economische en technische niet de minste zijn, dit soort demografische processen.
In Indonesië bedrijft de overheid een omvolkingspolitiek in de perifere gebieden, waarbij Irian Jaya specifiek onder druk staat.

Die processen hangen ook samen met de dynamiek in de globale economie, waarbij schaalvergroting ook leidt tot 'grensoverschrijding' en uitwisseling. Ook intercontinentaal is er geen basiswet die bepaalt welke richting grensoverschrijding kan plaatsvinden, meestal bepaalt een technischpolitiek dominante partij hoe de stromen lopen, maar ook dan vindt aan beide kanten grensoverschrijding plaats.

Het komt mij voor dat je een bepaalde demografische druk op internationale schaal wel kunt sturen, maar niet kunt tegenhouden als daar economisch/politieke krachten achter zitten.

De veelgeprezen Renaissance heeft als achtergrond de gecombineerde dynamiek van de Arabische expansie, de verbanning van Joden uit Spanje  en later Portugal (indirect dus ook de Joodse diaspora)
en de Ottomaanse expansie. De Zeven Provinciën floreerden op de instroom van vaklieden uit vervolgde bevolkingsgroepen en daar zie je ook een dynamiek van koloniale emigratie richting verre oorden van Nieuw Amsterdam tot Brazilië, de Caraïben, de Westafrikaanse kust, Kaap de Goede Hoop, Ceylon, tot aan Japan en Formosa en de Indonesische Archipel.
De tijd staat niet stil en het romantische beeld van een ideale eeuw van nationale eendracht en puurheid helpt niet om met de globale dynaniek van vandaag en morgen om te gaan. Wie gehecht is aan de Nederlandse cultuur zal toch ook het element van globalisme moeten erkennen.

De claim van verdedigen van Europese culturele waarden vanuit de PIS en Fidesz uitgangspunten loopt al gauw vast op de achterliggende corruptie en valse rethoriek rond nationale trots. 
Als je politieke vertegenwoordigers met een rugzak met xtc langs de regenpijp wegvluchten uit een homogangbang in het centrum van het liberale EU-sodom&amp;gomorra, is de spagaat wel erg wijd.

Het kan best minder extreem en gebaseerd op angsten of verdrongen verlangens die op de ander geprojecteerd worden. Relativeren is soms alleen weglopen voor feiten, maar soms ook nodig, juist om feiten in perspectief te zien.
Wie liberale vrijheden als decadent of zwak verwerpt moet ook afstand nemen van die decadentie en niet in het donker (of de beslotenheid van de binnenkamer) de katjes willen kunnen knijpen.

Wat dat betreft is cultuur en beschaving ook een kwestie van persoonlijke integriteit en niet zozeer gebonden aan etnische of religieuze achtergrond.

1. Create all of your created players and just have them in free agency (by default that’s where they go anyway) 

2. Fire up a 31-team Franchise mode. None of the settings matter EXCEPT: Turn ON Fantasy Draft and turn OFF Fog or War (the team you pick and the rest doesn’t matter)

3. Sim the entire Fantasy Draft

4. Once you get through the dialogue with the owner, go to the tab under “Team Management” that says “View Lines” 

5. Using an excel spreadsheet or Google sheets, record each 23-man roster for all 31 teams (don’t forget the scratched players) also record all free agents that are 75/76 overall and higher. 

6. Begin creating your teams. Assign players from their original teams using the 31 team fantasy draft to the created teams. 

***VERY IMPORTANT*** Make 100% sure to take note of players that are on AHL, CHL and European teams OR  in Free Agency!

7.  Go to the Roster Management menu

8. Select player movement 

9. Assign all players that you selected from AHL/CHL/European/Free Agency to an international team (USA, Canada, Japan, etc) This will prevent duplicates from appearing in your actual franchise mode 

What happens if you don’t do this? Let’s take Mikael Granlund as an example. He’s current in Free Agency. If you don’t move him to an international team (like Japan or Bulgaria or any country you want), when you start your franchise mode, there will be a Mikael Granlund on one of your created teams and in free agency and you don’t want that. 

10. Next, move all players that were in the free agency following the fantasy draft from their current team to free agency. 

Example: Say Joe Thornton went undrafted and was in Free Agency after the fantasy draft. In roster movement, move Thornton from Maple Leafs to free agency. This will ensure he’s available in the league! If you forget to move free agents, they might not be in the franchise mode at all. 

11. Start your fully custom franchise mode with whatever settings you like! I usually do 32-team custom expansion. 

12. Once you get to the team selection screen, click the button on your controller that lets you select a “replacement team” and sub all the current NHL teams for your custom teams. 

Note: The team you substitute will inherit all of the prospects and AHL team of the team they replaced. (ie of the Burnaby Aces replace Anaheim, they’ll now have all the Ducks prospects not taken in the fantasy draft and their affiliate will be the San Diego Gulls)

And you have no science to show how much reopening increases exposure let alone infection, because there is no consistent correlation between lockdown measures and covid containment.

As a result, those waters are in fact relatively fish-poor.

On the other hand, in the Middle Ages, following Catholic dietary rules, in particular meatless Fridays and Lent, became quite important if you wished to show that you were an observant, sincere Christian and not a hidden Muslim or Jew. This boosted seafood consumption (which is to this day, distinctly higher in both Spain and Portugal than in most other European countries).

So, facing high demand and low supply, Iberian fishermen started sailing farther and farther away to find good fisheries.

Indeed, there’s some speculation that Columbus may have been guided or at least inspired by those fishermen’s knowledge...In any case, Iberian appetite for fish certainly helped drive Portuguese and Spanish sailors into the Age of Discoveries.

Back in that age, salting was basically way of preserving fish caught that far away for the whole return journey. Salted cod became ubiquitous in Portuguese (and Basque) cuisine.

This can feel a bit counter-intuitive, given the current media landscape: 

Commercial Turkish TV channels and Iranian diaspora channels (such as *Manoto TV*) are a relatively common occurrence in *contemporary* urban households of the ex-Soviet republics of Azerbaijan and Tajikistan, respectively (alongside Russian TV channels, unsurprisingly). One can attribute this to the rich choice of such foreign programming (the range and quality of domestic TV broadcasting is seen as poor) and, *more importantly*, to the fact that satellite dishes have finally become affordable in the past two or three decades.

An exploration of the **structural factors**, such as technology, demographics and geopolitics of the Cold War era can therefore provide a more satisfactory answer to your question.

*Sag0Sag0* alluded to a very good point, namely that the only prominent historical case of mass media programming from outside the Eastern Bloc gaining a cultural foothold on Soviet territory pertains to Estonia, specifically the capital of Tallinn and adjacent areas. The residents of the latter were able to catch itinerant Finnish TV signal ever since 1971 (Estonian-speakers can develop listening comprehension of spoken Finnish with relative ease). The reason why the Soviet authorities did not make a greater effort to counter this was the perceived benign character of TV programming coming from a neutral (albeit admittedly capitalist) country and the latter country's reasonably close relations with the USSR.

Cultural encroachment from Turkey, Iran and Afghanistan in the form of radio and TV broadcasting was not a common-enough phenomenon to warrant Moscow's attention. If anything, the ""soft power projection"" dynamic was in the opposite direction.

Ideologically slanted, Soviet-backed radio programming aimed at Turkish (in the form of the East Germany-based *Bizim Radyo* (Our Radio)) and Iranian (in the form of the Baku-based *Râdiyo-ye sedâ-ye melli-ye Irân* (National Voice of Iran Radio)) audiences would not openly admit to being the mouthpiece of a foreign superpower, despite broadcasting continuously for three entire decades since the late 1950s. Shortwave radios across the globe would also be able to catch Radio Moscow, which was much more open about its state affiliation and editorial policy. Regional branches such as Radio Yerevan, Radio Baku, Radio Dushanbe and Radio Tashkent would broadcast in the regional languages spoken in the USSR's southern neighbourhood, such as Arabic, Kurdish, Turkish and Persian, but also in Urdu and Hindi in the case of Radio Tashkent.

Only an extremely small segment of the population of Turkey, Iran, or Afghanistan (such as the people on the northernmost fringes of Iranian Azerbaijan, the *Turkmensahra* and Afghan Turkestan) was able to catch itinerant ""domestic"" radio and TV signal emanating from the Soviet Republics, more often than not in a language they could understand.

So why was picking up radio and television frequencies *even less often* the case in the opposite direction, USSR-ward?

Regional demographics, further altered by Soviet ""social engineering"" on the USSR side, and the promotion of the state language at the expense of regional languages southward, across the border, played a role: Virtually no part of Eastern Turkey directly bordered Azerbaijani Turkish-speaking areas of the Soviet Union. Like many other ""untrustworthy"" Soviet ethnic groups with cross-border kinship ties, the bulk of Meskhetians (Ahıska Turks) of Southwestern Georgia had been deported to Central Asia in 1944, on the orders of Stalin. As far as Iranian radio broadcasting was concerned, the absence of Azerbaijani language (the second most widely spoken language of Iran) media programming disallowed Iran's unintentional mass media penetration into Soviet Azerbaijan. Northeastern Iran, in turn, was too far from the Persian-speaking population centres of Southern Uzbekistan and Tajikistan for commonly used radio frequencies.

It perhaps should be mentioned that one of the factors behind the establishment of Tadzhik Soviet Socialist Republic in the late 1920s (up to that point a mere autonomous republic within Soviet Uzbekistan) was the ""soft power projection"" potential Soviet authorities saw in showcasing a Persian-language Leninist-Marxist polity. The aim was to appeal to the ""culturally Persianate"" Muslim intelligentsia of British India via media broadcasting, travel grants and print publications.

In the same decade, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk formulated the objective for his newly founded Turkish Republic of consolidating a Turkish nation exclusively within the borders of the Republic. He thus eschewed the distraction that a nation-building process inclusive of the Turkic speakers abroad, especially those living in the Soviet Union, would inevitably entail.

Unlike pre-Revolutionary Iran and NATO member Turkey, Afghanistan was already solidly in the Soviet orbit by the 1970s, the decade when radio ownership became commonplace in this poor country.

It ultimately boils down to the context of the Cold War. The foci of the propaganda struggle between the American-led Bloc and the Eastern Bloc were Central Europe and East/Southeast Asia (with US-funded *Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty* and *Radio Free Asia*'s foreign language services reflecting this). Any Western-backed plan to gain a cultural foothold of the Soviet ""Southern periphery"" by means of radio or television broadcasting would have had to overcome this peripheral status. As far as purely ""domestic"" radio and television waves unintentionally crossing the border into Soviet population centres were concerned, the border-adjacent areas would generally lack an audience fluent in Turkish (in the case of Georgia and Armenia) or Persian (in the case of Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan). This was a bit of a paradoxical situation, given that millions of Soviet citizens further East would have no trouble understanding standard Turkish and Iranian Persian, as the recent proliferation of satellite TV has clearly demonstrated.

 Segundo os relatos, Szájer tentou escapar, mas foi impedido pelos policiais. Os presentes foram interrogados e multados por não cumprirem as normas de confinamento da cidade que é a sede de instituições da União Europeia.

 Em Bruxélas, as medidas seguem bastante restritivas. Bares e restaurante estão fechados e, no comércio, as pessoas devem fazer compras sozinhas, sem acompanhante, além de não poderem permanecer por mais de 30 minutos dentro dos estabelecimentos.

 Na véspera de Natal, o toque de recolher será adiado para meia-noite. As famílias podem convidar uma pessoa extra para celebrar o Natal, enquanto pessoas que moram sozinhas podem receber até duas pessoas

  Szájer ocupou uma cadeira na Assembleia Nacional da Hungria entre 1990 e 2004, quando foi eleito para o Europarlamento. Ele é casado desde 1982 com a jurista Tünde Handó, com quem tem uma filha.

 Ele havia renunciado repentinamente a seu assento no Parlamento da União Europeia no domingo (29), mas admitiu nesta terça-feira (1º) que era um dos participantes da orgia em Bruxelas.

 ""Eu não usei drogas, me ofereci aos policiais para fazer um teste, mas eles não quiseram. A polícia disse ter encontrado pílulas de ecstasy, mas não eram minhas. Não sei quem as colocou ali nem como. Sinto muito por ter violado as regras sobre reuniões, foi algo irresponsável da minha parte"", disse à imprensa local.

 “Peço desculpas à minha família, aos meus colegas e aos meus eleitores. Esse passo em falso foi estritamente pessoal, sou o único responsável por isso. Peço a todos que não o estendam à minha pátria ou à minha comunidade política"", acrescentou.

 Szájer é um dos dos fundadores do ultraconservador Fidesz, partido do primeiro-ministro Orbán, que tem discurso nacionalista e contra a população LGBT.

 Em maio, o partido ajudou a aprovar uma lei que substitui a categoria de ""sexo"" no registro civil por ""sexo atribuído em nascimento"", definido como ""sexo biológico baseado em características sexuais primárias e cromossomos"".

The worst I've had is I was once quietly asked what was in my trousers while a security guy at an airport was patting me down and I said ""prosthetic"", but that's only relevant if the airport uses body scanners instead of metal detectors.

Additionally, the guy above you rewrote history on the impeachment proceedings. Like bad. Trump was impeached because he called up an ally for dirt on a political adversary and halted the expenditure of already allocated funds for aid to do so, therefore using government power for his own political ends. He was also impeached for the cover-up. He was, in essence, impeached for corruption. 

More than a handful of Senate Republicans even agreed that what the president did was unbecoming or wrong, but just that it was not an impeachable offense.

&gt;Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infections in a German school setting found that only 6 out of 137 (4%) index cases went on to infect other students, resulting in total of 11 secondary infections among students. The authors suggest that with infection control measures in place, child-to-child transmission in schools is low.

&gt;A German study analyzed new SARS-CoV-2 infections among children ages 0-19 years old from the time of school reopening through summer holiday (May to August 2020). A total of 137 index cases were identified who attended school or childcare settings for at least 1 day in their infectious period and among these, 6 (4%) index cases infected at least one additional student, with a total of 11 secondary infections among students.

&gt;Study abstract:

&gt;We investigated data from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected 0–19 year olds, who attended schools/childcare facilities, to assess their role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission after these establishments’ reopening in May 2020 in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Child-to-child transmission in schools/childcare facilities appeared very uncommon. We anticipate that, with face mask use and frequent ventilation of rooms, transmission rates in schools/childcare facilities would remain low in the next term, even if classes’ group sizes were increased.

(but, as he put it, ""any ape with arms could do what you do""---fun times). 

So he gets married within the first year he is there, but 3-4 yr later they decide they need a REAL wedding, back in her home country (Europe).  So he was supposed to take 5 weeks to do this thing.  He disappeared for FOUR MONTHS.  No contact, at all.  He swoops back 4 weeks before his government contract project is supposed to wrap up, and expects everyone else to drop every other project to support his.  Again, fun times.  

Then he proceeds to come in from 10-2, 1-2 days a week for the next 3-4 years, often going weeks with no show.  I get told I NEED TO MANAGE HIM.  Um- we are the same level?  I made LESS money than he did (my PhD was not worth as much as his, supposedly- even though I brought in 4X as much money). 

Our boss woudl tell our team that he was ""working from home"".  I had been friends with his wife before the re-wedding mess (I just could not deal with disappearing for 4 months and no consequences, or his attitude when he finally did come back, so I just stopped hanging out with them).  So we were friends on Facebook- I though ""home"" looks an awful lot like Zion, Yellowstone, Yosemite, etc.  

When I finally hit my last nerve and quit, I went on a long walk with him- we were actually somewhat friendly- his wife and I were friends before the whole re-wedding debacle (I stopped hanging out with them because of that behavior).  I asked him WTF was up with not showing up for weeks at a time, etc. He said- you know- no one ever said anything after the wedding.  He fully expected to come back and be fired.  But he did not even get talked to.  So he just kept doing it.  It made his life easier, and he could spend time with his wife and kids, and travel, so why not.  

I about DIED.  For YEARS our bosses (a married couple) would bitch LOUDLY about where was X, (like we were all his keepers?), etc.  And THEY NEVER SPOKE TO HIM????

É estranho a primeira vista mas bem mais comum do que parece. 

Os semitas são um grupo racial e não religioso. Esse grupo que hoje enquadra os judeus e os palestinos. Obviamente maior parte dos judeus (e os que são declaradamente sionistas em especial) não gostam que falem dessa forma sobre esta questão (e digo inclusive que é questão de tempo pra aparecer alguém aqui me chamado de racista, neo-nazista, ou coisa do tipo pra me atacar por estar falando isso dessa forma), mas é inegável que o Estado judeu após criação de Israel e com a ajuda de grupos como a ADL pegou o significado de anti semitismo e ressignificou isso para que fosse entendido como um preconceito contra toda a cultura judaica, provavelmente como uma forma de proteger o sionismo, que é um movimento político e não religioso, de criticas. Falar que todo anti sionista é anti semita é como dizer (guardada as devidas proporções) que todo mundo que critica a política do bolsonaro hoje o faz porque é anti cristão porque o cristianismo é a vertente religiosa majoritária no Brasil e porque todos os presidentes do Brasil até hoje foram cristãos. Uma crítica ao governo do Estado de Israel é uma crítica política, não um ódio velado aos judeus como grupo religioso ou etnico, mas é assim que muitos vendem o anti sionismo falando que anti sionismo e anti semitismo é a mesma coisa. 

Por isso que existem judeus anti sionistas mesmo dentro de Israel hoje. Está certo que é mais prevalente entre judeus seculares (que tenho a impressão que é um grupo bem pequeno dentro do país) mas também existem judeus religiosos que renegam o sionismo também. O Noam Chomsky é um judeu que é declaradamente anti sionista e é frequentemente atacado por isso por comunidades judias e comumente chamado de traidor do povo judeu em Israel pelo o que eu sei. 

E só pra deixar claro, eu não renego que o Holocausto existiu, não sou contra a existência do Estado de Israel e muito menos tenho preconceito religioso ou racial contra qualquer semita (independente da religião professada por ele), só acho que tem muita gente que vergonhosamente usa o sofrimento real dos judeus no passado como escudo contra críticas à políticas que no meu entender são vergonhosas de se usar, independente da religião, cor ou credo que o faz.

Era um dia comum. Você levantou, tomou café da manhã e foi navegar nas suas redes sociais. Eis que você encontra um link em uma postagem de uma dessas páginas de feminização que você segue. A descrição dizia que uma vez entrando no site não teria mais volta. E só isso. Você não se aguentou de curiosidade e acessou o link. Pra sua decepção, nada aconteceu. O dia foi passando e quando já estava quase na hora de dormir denovo você notou algo estranho. Suas unhas estavam brilhando... como se você tivesse passado uma camada de esmalte claro. Mas você não se lembra de ter feito isso. Em fim, você notou que era realmente esmalte à medida que conseguiu ir descascando ele pouco a pouco com o dente. Depois que tirou tudo você lavou as mãos, apagou a luz e foi dormir. Na madrugada acordou pra ir ao banheiro e ao pegar no seu pau pra mijar por um segundo você achou que uma mulher que tinha feito isso. Até perceber que aquela era a sua mão. Suas unhas estavam agora todas com um esmalte visível. Era um rosa claro mas bem perceptível. Após passar o choque você não sabia o que fazer. Por sorte você tinha uma garrafa de removedor de esmalte e conseguiu tirar sem problemas. Nesse ponto você achou que já tava delirando, e voltou pra cama na esperança (ou não) de que fosse só um sonho. Pela manhã você teve a confirmação de que tudo era real. Dessa vez, Suas unhas já estavam vermelhas. Um vermelho gritante, bem chamativo. Elas estavam maiores e perfeitamente lixadas no estilo coffin. Com medo de que alguém visse, você foi novamente tirar o esmalte, mas com receio do que poderia acontecer caso tirasse denovo. Pra sua surpresa, nenhum arranhãozinho... Suas unhas continuavam perfeitamente vermelhas. Você então tentou descascar, e falhou novamente. Tentou de tudo o que podia, e nada dava certo. Por fim, tentou até mesmo lixar. E o vermelho continuava brilhando. Você então decide sair pra procurar ajuda. Mas ao ir vestir uma roupa (você dormiu pelado) notou que nenhuma das suas roupas estavam onde deviam estar. Na verdade, você não achava em lugar nenhum. Quando você olha pra sua cama, vê finalmente uma roupa. Mas não era sua... na verdade, era uma blusa feminina e um short jeans (bem curto). Você entao se ve numa situação onde sua única opção é tentar se passar por mulher pra conseguir sair de casa e encontrar um jeito de consertar suas unhas. Como se não bastasse, ao lado da cama um salto alto vermelho lhe aguardava. E lá foi você à sua primeira aparição em público vestido de mulher. Claro, você não parecia nada uma mulher bonita, mas dava pra ao menos disfarçar que era um homem travistido. Decidiu ir num salão e pedir pra removerem o esmalte. No caminho você ouve uma voz te chamando em um beco perto da rua. Ao olhar para o local você vê uma mulher, muito atraente, acenando te chamando pra mais perto. Ao chegar lá a primeira coisa que ela faz é checar suas mãos. Ao ver as unhas vermelhas ela sorri e fala: espero que você goste de samba. Ela então vira de costas e caminha em direção ao escuro beco. Você sem entender, chama ela desesperadamente e pergunta: O que você quis dizer? O que tá acontecendo comigo? Como eu tiro esse vermelho?
Ela responde: tirar? Hahahaha... suas unhas vão ser perfeitas assim pelo resto da sua vida. Assim como as mudanças que estão por vir... vai ser tudo permanente. Acostume-se lindeza.

Despite occasionally[engaging](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/kurdish-mayors-removed-turkey-suleyman-soylu-ekrem-imamoglu-a9073466.html) with the HDP recently, mostly on having a common goal of weakening Erdogan, the CHP also has yet to take concrete steps to address the Kurdish issue. In June 2019, CHP candidate Ekrem Imamoglu was elected mayor of Istanbul after the HDP refrained from entering a candidate in this election and the HDP’s popular former co-chair, Selahattin Demirtas, spoke in support of Imamoglu from prison. The votes of millions of Kurds in Istanbul were decisive in delivering victory to Imamoglu who, nonetheless, later supported Turkish military aggression against Kurdish regions of Syria. It bears mention that another problem facing the CHP is that some of its lawmakers and members who expressed support for a resolution of the Kurdish issue are[either exiled](https://twitter.com/aykan_erdemir) by the AKP or are no longer with the party.
&gt; 
&gt; Across the political spectrum, all of Turkey’s opposition parties other than the HDP, large and small, old and young, make efforts to win Kurdish votes but refrain from seriously addressing the Kurdish question. This approach will deepen the crises facing not only the Kurds but all other citizens of Turkey as well. A productive approach would be to address the Kurdish issue by educating the country’s population on the reality of the Kurdish question and how has affected citizens from all walks of life, and acknowledge how it has been used as a tool by successive Turkish regimes to manipulate the country’s citizens. Against great odds and an ongoing, intensifying campaign of systematic persecution, the HDP is proving that will remain part of Turkey’s political scene and continue to speak out for the rights of the Kurdish people and other oppressed groups in the country. The country’s other opposition parties should realize that selective acknowledgement of topics relating to the Kurds is not enough to address one of the country’s major issues, and is inconsistent with standing against the authoritarianism of Erdogan and the AKP. If there is no cooperation with the HDP for true democratization, Erdogan will continue to split the[opposition and will remain in power.](https://www.mei.edu/blog/erdogans-efforts-split-opposition-seem-be-working) In Turkey’s 2018 general elections, the[Turkish opposition coalition excluded the HDP](https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/turkey/23052018-amp), and the AKP, which pressed ahead with what was roundly considered to be[an unfair election](https://www.cfr.org/blog/turkeys-elections-partially-free-fair-and-fake) during a state of emergency, was victorious, winning 344 of 600 total seats in parliament. Since 2018, Erdogan has continued to centralize power and rule with an iron fist, with his AKP supported by the ultra-nationalist MHP despite rising discontent among the country’s citizens. As Erdogan jails opponents at home and engages in military adventurism abroad, Turkey is weathering another serious economic crisis compounded by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. If the Turkish opposition forces intend to make a sincere effort to save the country from collapse, they must form a strong alliance to represent those persecuted and alienated by Erdogan, and this cannot be done without the support and participation of the HDP and the Kurds.

[],,ClasslessCommunist,,,,[],,,,text,t2_2x1romc7,False,False,[],"I personally am against pretty much any gun control as it has always been a way to relegate access to those most fortunate. The NFA's expressed intent was to make short barrelled rifles, shotguns, and suppressors so expensive that the mob couldn't reasonably afford them all. Thereby also making them impossible for working class people to afford.

I could have my arm twisted into something like mandatory classes and education, if the government paid for it and it didn't require sign off from a gun club (or associations like the SRA would be recognized as a viable gun club for those who don't fit into the typical gun/chud crowd). However, I really don't like the EU style crap where you have to get sign offs from some gun club in order to buy a license to purchase a gun and blah blah blah. More bureaucracy and mandatory classes means more time investment, which to working class people on hourly wages, working multiple jobs, means more opportunity costs, which equals undo burden, and that's not to mention our non-white, non-christian, non-cishet comrades who aren't going to have fun with the old fudds and shotguns club.

Personally, I think anything that fails to address the root causes of crime is ineffective and misguided. If we don't do something about poverty, education, and healthcare, then people will kill each other with knives over cans of beans, it doesn't matter the tools. I hate to sound like a republican, but what they fail to recognize or do fucking anything about is the disgusting amounts of inequality and alienation within American society that drives the majority of violent crime. They are right to point towards other countries and say that gun control didn't work there, but they never look further into why people are committing crime in the first place.

Democrats on the other hand, tend to care about the scary black rifles every time some alienated and miseducated psycho goes on a killing spree, which I find to sadly, perfectly exemplify the exact kind of race/class bias which dominates their party. The vast majority of shooting deaths are done with handguns, and in poor neighborhoods. Liberals always focus on the scary ""weapons of war"" (I fucking hate that phrase) that account for like 1% of shooting deaths and most likely killed white people, meanwhile they ignore the fact that handguns are killing black and hispanic men in horrific numbers, daily. Taking away my AR and Glock isn't going to do anything about the factors that drive that sort of crime. So again, liberals are treating a symptom of capitalism and not the disease itself by trying to restrict access to guns.

So if you ask me, before we do anything about restricting access to self defense and a means to put food on the table (yes, a lot of people hunt with ARs that they built for cheap in weird chambers like 350 Legend because of dumb state laws regarding how you can hunt deer) we first need to solve the problems that we already know cause crime. Doing anything about guns without addressing those factors is, not just delusional, but actively impeding my means of self defense in what appears to be a global rising fascism before what I expect to become the world's largest migrant crisis caused by global warming. I've actually thought a lot about what happens if Biden passes some of this shit and then somebody more competent than Trump gets elected. Luckily it seems, for the moment, he will be lucky to even regulate pistol stabilizing braces.

So if liberals want to make us take classes to get a gun license and all that stuff, then they better give us free college and affordable healthcare. If they fail (again) at those, I'm just gonna keep voting Green and training.

Glyphosate (G) is the most common weed-killer in the world. Every year tons and tons of G are applied on crop fields. G was first introduced in the mid 1970s and since then its usage has gradually increased to reach a peak since 2005. Now G usage is approximately 100 -fold what it was in 1970. Its impact on human health was considered benign at the beginning. But over the years, evidence of a pervasive negative effect of this pesticide on humans has been mounting. Nonetheless, G usage is allowed by government health control agencies (both in the United States and Europe), that rely upon the evidence produced by the G producer. However, the IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer) in 2015 has stated that G is probable carcinogenic (class 2A), the second highest class in terms of risk. 

Objective:

In this review, we explore the effect of G on human health, focusing in particular on more recent knowledge. 

Results:

We have attempted to untangle the controversy about the dangers of the product for human beings in view of a very recent development, when the so -called Monsanto Papers, consisting of Emails and memos from Monsanto came to light, revealing a coordinated strategy to manipulate the debate about the safety of glyphosate to the company’s advantage. 

Conclusion:

The story of G is a recurrent one (see the tobacco story), that seriously jeopardizes the credibility of the scientific study in the modern era.",True,False,False,,,,0,1606879087,,False,0,{},geby5sd,True,t3_k51147,False,True,t3_k51147,/r/ScienceShareCenter/comments/k51147/the_herbicide_glyphosate_and_its_apparently/geby5sd/,False,,1618106292,1,True,False,ScienceShareCenter,t5_3ga3e4,r/ScienceShareCenter,public,,0,[],

Many Australian's who haven't lived or travelled overseas with s outside of the tourist bubble aren't acutely aware of this fact and continue to pay extortionate prices for the basics in life - a good cup of coffee and cigarette in the morning and a cheap meal and boozy drink at night.

Seriously, alcohol and cigarettes are highly taxed to unethical proportions. Sure, I know the health reasons for smokes but still the cost is not the same in European countries. 

Groceries are expensive - cheese, fish, honey, ready made meals. After living in Europe I can't believe what I have to pay for the basics in life and I can't believe I ever did in the past. I feel quite stupid for paying what I used to pay for things in Australia - now I don't buy them. I mean a gourmet bakery charging $7 for a croissant. Are you kidding me? 

I maximise my budget buy buying fruit and veg at the end of the day at markets where I get bargains and I try to only shop at Aldi. Lidl is better but it's not in Australia. Australia is the home of duopoly - Coles and Woolworths have market share in grocery so set the high prices and Aussie's pay it.

Sure, there's the mantra 'but we have high wages. Australia's wages are higher than other countries but they also aren't increasing, yet we have high inflation in many sectors. 

Glass of wine at a standard place - $10-12 minimum, restaurants varies greatly depending on the 'status' and suburb. A Malayasian buffet meal with 2 dishes and rice order at the counter is $16 and can last two meals vs sit down nicer place will be $20-30.

Check the website [numbeo.com](https://numbeo.com) for a cost of living comparison. It gives you the option to enter where you're living now with cities and countries all around the world - it's fun and illuminating. 

Some jobs - say 50% are offering me \*less than what I earnt here 10 years ago.  I'm not exaggerating. Others that are paying more are about the same as I was earning 2-3 years ago.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_genocide#Pre-independent_Rwanda_and_the_origins_of_Hutu,_Tutsi_and_Twa_groups

&gt; Prior to and during colonial rule, Rwanda had some eighteen clans defined primarily along lines of kinship. Although the terms Hutu and Tutsi were in use, they referred to individuals rather than to groups, and the distinction between them was based on lineage rather than ethnicity. In fact, one could often move from one status to another.

&gt; [Germans] favoured the Tutsi over the Hutu when assigning administrative roles, believing them to be racially superior. Belgian forces took control of Rwanda and Burundi during World War I, and from 1926 began a policy of more direct colonial rule. The Belgians modernised the Rwandan economy, but Tutsi supremacy remained, leaving the Hutu disenfranchised.

&gt; In 1935, Belgium introduced a permanent division of the population by strictly dividing the population into three ethnic groups, with the Hutu representing about 84% of the population, Tutsi about 15%, and Twa about 1% of the population. Identity cards were issued labeling each individual as either Tutsi, Hutu, Twa, or Naturalised. While it had previously been possible for particularly wealthy Hutus to become honorary Tutsis, the identity cards prevented any further movement between the groups. Christian missionaries promoted the theory about the ""Hamitic"" origins of the kingdom, and referred to the distinctively Ethiopian features and hence, foreign origins, of the Tutsi ""caste"". These mythologies provide the basis for anti-Tutsi propaganda in 1994. 

France also apparently directly intervened during the genocide to support the Hutu genociders.

From market access for stockbrokers to passports for pets, Brussels is still holding back on granting Britain a whole collection of rights and regulatory waivers with under five weeks until the UK exits the EU’s single market.

With Brexit negotiators hunkered down in London in search of a breakthrough in trade talks, some important aspects of life after the end of the transition period on December 31 will be determined by the EU’s willingness to extend rights to the UK that it has already granted to other non-members of the bloc.

In some cases — such as financial services — this takes the form of unilateral rights that are in the European Commission’s gift. In other cases, the question is whether the EU is ready to negotiate flexible arrangements with the UK to protect existing trade for businesses on both sides of the Channel.

But so far, there has been largely silence from Brussels, adding to tensions ahead of the end of the transition period. If the decisions are not granted it would add to the fallout from a no-trade deal Brexit. For example, British motorists would not enjoy the same waiver from burdensome insurance red tape that the EU has extended to other non-EU members such as Serbia. Nor would the City of London benefit from valuable market access rights granted to other financial centres such as New York.

EU officials say that the bloc’s stance is being driven by factors ranging from a desire to maximise negotiating leverage in the trade talks to genuine difficulties in figuring out how to extend certain regulatory permissions.

Here, the Financial Times considers the three categories of EU rights that the UK is still waiting to be granted, many of them technically outside the scope of the negotiations, but nevertheless intertwined with the politics of the future-relationship talks.

*1. Pure bargaining chips*

These are the areas, such as pet passports and health insurance schemes for travellers, where there should be no technical obstacle preventing the commission from acting.

But by applying the principle of “nothing is agreed until everything is agreed”, the commission has increased the potential political cost for the UK of a no-deal outcome in future-relationship negotiations.

On pet passports, for example, the UK has applied to become a “part 1 listed” country and so be affiliated to the EU’s scheme, which allows dogs, cats and ferrets to cross borders without quarantine. It is a status that other non-EU countries, such as Greenland, Switzerland and Iceland have been granted, but the UK has awaited a decision for at least the past two years. 

Failure to secure the status would place hugely onerous burdens on British pet owners, who would be required to send blood samples to EU-accredited labs at least 30 days after their pet’s last rabies vaccination, with results taking up to four months to be returned.

Similarly, a replacement for the EU’s “EHIC” health insurance scheme that guarantees emergency cover for UK and EU travellers, including those with pre-existing conditions, is another area of mutual interest where a technical agreement should be possible. The UK is seeking to negotiate a reciprocal arrangement, but failure to get this would leave elderly holidaymakers in particular facing heftier insurance premiums when they head to the EU.

A third example is a reciprocal waiver for the “green card” car insurance scheme that would spare British and EU motorists pointless bureaucracy when they cross the Channel — but on which the commission has withheld an “enabling decision” since at least May 2018.

*2. Difficult but do-able*

The significant examples here are two areas that the EU and UK agreed to largely leave out of their future-relationship talks: financial services and data. 

The EU’s model is that rights in these areas are created through unilateral decisions. For financial services, this would mean the EU and UK judging that each other has a regulatory system as strict as its own. For personal data, the EU would need to take an “adequacy decision”, endorsing UK privacy standards as sufficient to allow companies to transfer digitally-held information across the Channel.

EU officials have been clear that the bloc is deeply reluctant to show its hand on financial services while trade talks with Britain continue. But the exercise is also complex, especially given that the UK’s post-Brexit regulatory regime is still bedding down: the EU sent 1,000 pages of questionnaires to UK authorities earlier this year, and got 2,500 pages of answers back. 

On data, the situation is arguably even more difficult. While the EU has already taken decisions favourable to countries such as Japan and New Zealand, the situation has since become more complicated owing to a victory for privacy advocates in the European courts — raising the bar the EU has to reach before granting permissions. 

There are other, smaller examples that fall into this category, such as the fact that unless the EU amends its export health certificate for animal products, British meat products such as minced beef and sausages will have to be exported to the EU in frozen form in order to conform to EU rules for meat imports from “third countries”.

*3. Managing long-term challenges*

Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, has made clear that the EU needs to think about how to manage the long-term challenge posed by the new competitor on its doorstep.

The upshot of that has been a negotiating position so hawkish that even the EU car industry warned in October that it was not in its interests. Brussels rejected UK proposals aimed at preserving existing supply chains, instead pushing stricter rules on the proportion of local content needed for goods to qualify for zero tariffs. 

Joint calls this summer from the EU and UK food and drink producers for Mr Barnier to be more “flexible” are also expected to be rejected, with the industry warning that it faces a “hidden hard Brexit” as products made with non-EU or UK ingredients fail to qualify for zero-tariff access to the EU single market.

The medical devices and chemicals industries have also asked for flexibility and mutual recognition of product testing regimes, but Mr Barnier has consistently argued that it will not be in the EU’s long-term economic interests to grant these testing rights to the UK as it seeks to draw business, investment and supply chains into the bloc’s single market.",True,False,False,,,,0,1606885384,,False,0,{},gec8d7y,True,t3_k52qom,True,False,t3_k52qom,/r/ukpolitics/comments/k52qom/eu_keeps_uk_guessing_on_postbrexit_rights/gec8d7y/,False,,1618111047,5,True,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,r/ukpolitics,public,,0,[],

*“Devemos ter a cabeça aberta, mas não ao ponto do nosso cérebro cair de lá”* — Richard Dawkins

&gt; eu te pergunto, os pais estão indignificando a condição humana dessa criança?

Sou pai de dois adolescentes. Me assumi como ateu pouco depois que meu primeiro filho nasceu.

Nunca nenhum dos dois fez ceninha, birra, berraram, cairam no chão se estrebuchando.

Sou severo? Não. Apenas me inclinava para eles e explicava a situação. Se a criança frequenta escola, já é capaz de entender, mesmo que rudimentar, sobre responsabilidade. Amanhã ela tem aula; precisamos voltar para casa dormir.

Não sei que crianças você conhece, mas não me parece uma negociação difícil.

Não, você não precisa dar crédito a meus talentos paternais. Meu ponto é: Eu não trato meus filhos como criaturas incapazes de entender a razão.

Se alguma coisa pudesse ser considerada uma razão além da capacidade deles compreender, é o momento de considerar se isto é razão de fato.

Você acha que tratar indivíduos conscientes como incapazes é algum tipo de “amor”. Eu acho que indignifica sua condição de consciente.

“Oh, mas o sentido é complexo demais”. Manter os indivíduos no escuro me parece ser o contrário de benéfico.

&gt; O materialista não vai conseguir perceber esse propósito pq não acredita q tem um Pai q quer o melhor para ele

Se não há apelo à única forma íntegra que existe, a razão, não é o caso do materialista “não perceber o propósito”, ele ignora deliberadamente.

&gt; Estamos vivos e progredindo enquanto espécie humana graças ao nosso sistema nervoso q nos permite sentir e perceber a dor. 

É, nenhum espírito veio nos dizer que era uma boa ideia ferver a água antes de beber, como fabricar penicilina e que usar máscaras durante uma pandemia respiratória seria uma boa ideia.

Todas estas conquistas são frutos do maior empreendimento humano, a Ciência.

Ciência esta afrontada pelo obscurantismo que defende o sobrenatural.

&gt; Já dizia o ditado ""Mar calmo nunca fez bom marinheiro""

Apenas instituições arcaicas acreditam que apenas por meio da dor há aprendizado. Instituições que facilmente apelariam para a metáfora de se treinar animais irracionais, surrando-os.

É, afinal, o que o texto que você linkou dizia: Os humanos são animais irracionais que precisam do mal para serem treinados.

Basically, the debt is not really a problem for the government of countries like the US and Japan because they are currency issuers, not currency users. A currency user is Greece and the euro. Greece no longer issues its own currency, it gave that up in favor of the Euro. But Japan and US control the Yen and the US Dollar respectively.

Our governments are the only ones that can issue our currency. So we are not indebted to anyone except ourselves, we do not have to pay our debts to some foreign body. Greece ultimately had to pay the EU Central Bank, when it could not do that, the economy collapsed.

The real problem is inflation. But like the top comment says, inflation is a function of real things and actions. If we are not exceeding those limitations then we will not face hyper inflation.

Another difference between Greece and Japan is that Greece began borrowing money to deal with debt, but at high interest rates that were established by the market. But Japan is able to set the interest rate if they want to. That's because if you want yen, you have to get it from the Japanese government. In Greece, if you wanted the Euro, you could get it from somewhere else.

Russian usually uses a zero copula in the present tense.

Иван был студентом *Ivan byl studentom* 'Ivan was a student'

Иван будет студентом *Ivan budet studentom* 'Ivan will be a student'

Иван — студент *Ivan — student* 'Ivan [is] a student'

The only remaining present tense form of the copula is есть *jest'*. It's mostly used to express existence or location.

В парке есть красивая статуя *V parke jest' krasivaja statuja* 'There is a beautiful statue in the park'

Есть can also be used in certain emphatic contexts and in situations where a copula can't be omitted, as in the following translation of Exodus 3:14:

Бог ответил Моисею:

– Я Тот, Кто Я Есть. Скажи израильтянам: «„Я Есть“ послал меня к вам».

*Bog otvetil Moiseju*

*– Ja Tot, Kto Ja Jest'. Skaži izrail'tjanam: «„Ja Jest'“ poslal menja k vam».*

'God answered Moses: I [am] That Who I Am. Tell the Israelites, ""'I Am' sent me to you""'

The verb 'to have' is иметь *imet'*. It's mostly used with abstract things and in fixed expressions. The usual way of expressing possession is with the preposition у *u* 'at, by, near'.

У меня есть кошка *U menja jest' koška* 'I have a cat' ('Near me is a cat')

Edit: One of the interesting effects of the general disappearance of the present tense copula in Russian is that it caused a participle to become the past tense form.

Sorry but no. GT is actually good with some languages, especially European ones, but there are some languages that this level of machine cannot translate. GT will struggle even with simple SoL games, because Japanese is a context heavy language. This is why when you translate English &gt; Japanese in GT, the Japanese result always ends up unnatural and explicitly state pronouns like ""I"" and ""you,"" especially ""I"" which is often omitted. Moreover, this game doesn't exactly have a modern setting and uses some special language, it requires human interpretation. If you ran it through Google, it would result in a literal translation. However, it's not actually a difficult read for someone with intermediate knowledge. In the end, it's modern writing, not some antique literature.

As for bad ends, they're not bad in the sense of ""problematic."" I've been playing without a guide but it seems each route has 2 bad endings, so I've done 4 bad endings so far. The game really doesn't put stress on the injustice aspect, like a game meant to provoke the reader would. The bad ends are bad because they're genuinely sad and your LI might end up dead.

I forgot to mention...When you take a look at the theme of the game and see stuff like ""white protagonist"" ""white is worshiped"" and ""ugly colors"" it's easy to project racial issues we know today and maybe assume the protagonist is some privileged jerk, but it's not like that at all.

Tariff-free trade on 98% of goods that can be exported to Canada including beef, fish and seafood and soft drinks. 
UK producers will continue to benefit from zero tariffs on many agricultural and seafood exports including chocolate, confectionary, fruit and vegetables, bread, pastries and fish. Last year the UK exported £344m worth of agri-food goods to Canada.

Dunno. Every Nordic person I’ve met and talked to seems to have the opinion that they will fight to the last man and defend their fellow Nordic nations in the case of Russian aggression.

Though Finland and Sweden have official defensive cooperation. However, based on conversations I’ve seen, looks like the Nordics see eachother as brethren in that regard and would likely all come to one another’s aid.

Plus war isn’t a game of just throwing numbers at a wall with no regard for morale. All the Nordics military strategy and training is built on defensive tactics meant to deal with Soviet(and now Russian) aggression. 

Basically they’re all trained to become Vietnam in the case of Russian aggression, especially the Finns who have an asston of equipment and training for that. A lot of MANPADS, mortars and AT equipment...

Not to mention, only Norway is in NATO and isn’t in the EU. 

So really. The Nordics afford their healthcare just fine without US military aid(especially Finland since they are only in the EU and aren’t allies with the US, instead they’re in the partnership for peace program)

I'm becoming a big fan of Shadiversity too.  I watched his leather armor video, and I don't think he was quite as hard on it as you're saying. 

Cost efficient: It all depends on your setting.  In medieval Europe, there's a lot more iron than cows available.  But presumably there are places where leather is fairly cheap.  In terms of labor though, yeah, it's a pain in the ass.

Protection: I've made a decent amount of leather armor pieces, including this [harness](https://imgur.com/a/tWxKgVu). When you've got overlapping layers of 12-16oz leather (the thickest stuff), it's pretty much cut-proof, unless you place it on an anvil and hit it with an axe or heavy chopping blade.  It is not stab/thrust proof, but still significantly better than nothing.  But at this thickness it's similar in weight to other armors, and not particularly comfortable.  It definitely is not the sleek/light/comfy/close fitting leather armor usually portrayed in RPGs.

All that said, I agree with you and Shad that it is an inferior armor.  I don't know how to compare it directly to Gambeson alone; if I had to choose I'd want the heavy leather for cut protection, and Gambeson for thrust protection (or just overall).  If Mail is available, go with that.  If plate is available, go with that. Historically, you will probably have a combination of gambeson/mail, mail/plate, gambeson/plate.

In terms of ""realism"", the answer is usually pretty simple: Wear the absolute best armor you can get your hands on.  If you can afford the best armor, historically  speaking, you've basically got cheat codes.

There's also all kinds of matchup issues, different qualities of craftsmanship, weak spots, and dirty techniques like being knocked down and stabbed in the armpit or neck with a dagger.

So ultimately... forget realism the moment it conflicts with fun. You aren't going to have actual realism in an RPG.  No one even KNOWS for sure the exact details of a lot of these things... They think the English Longbow was about 160lbs of draw because they found a bunch on a shipwreck.  Maybe that shipment were unusually weak or strong bows.  Maybe the metallurgy techniques we use to recreate 16th century bodkin arrows are actually too good and they shouldn't penetrate like they do in Tod's Workshop videos.

Do you have a reason why socialism wouldn’t work with a direct democracy?

Also, you don’t seem to understand what socialism is, so let me explain. 
Socialism at its core, is a democratization of the workplace and establishment of a strong welfare system, it doesn’t mean giving everyone the same house and car. Democratization of the workplace, aka redistributing the means of production amongst the working class, means that for a given company every employee has a vote that is worth as much as everyone else’s and most issues are voted for. If you dislike the direction the company is going in, you can vote for some other direction it could take, and if there is enough support, the company will change. Positions of power are in rotating mandates, which means that someone who is your boss today might work under you in six months, which encourages healthy workplace relationships and removes the abuse of power. If you want a great example of a company that follows these principles, go look up Mandragon, the 10th largest company in Spain. You can still have luxury goods, you can still buy whatever you want, but the way those things are produced change drastically. 

Also inherent to socialism is the establishment of a strong welfare state, where education, healthcare and housing are guaranteed by the state, but not necessarily mandated. I live in Switzerland (and btw I didn’t shit on the US, I shit on capitalism, funny you equated the two) where our education is socialized, and I am so fucking grateful that my studies in medicine cost me only 1000$ per year, which means I don’t need to even think about going in debt. Still not free, but much much better than the US or the UK for example. And before you criticize the quality of the education, we have the world’s sixth best university with the ETH Zürich. 

Healthcare, on the other hand, is unfortunately still private here, but you only need to look at our neighbours to see examples of it at work. German healthcare is free for every German citizen, French healthcare is free for every French citizen, and the same goes for Nordic countries, which all are doing very well. There’s also the NHS in the UK but it’s famously one of the worst public healthcares in Europe. 

Housing is a bit more of a sensitive topic, but still a core one, although there is a LOT of disagreement on the specifics amongst socialists, so this is my take on it, not the norm. Do you research if you want other points if view. Currently in Europe there are between 3 and 4 empty homes for each homeless person, and between 10 and 20 empty homes per homeless person in the US. It is not uncommon to see the different governments using similar laws to eminent domain in order to force uninhabited buildings to be sold to the state in order to make room for shopping centres, parking lots, hotels, even your fancy wall over in the US. would it really be that much different if the government bought emoty homes and instead of tearing them down they gave them to the needy? Yes there would, since people wouldn’t need to live on the street anymore instead of the interests of a business being served. There is no need to soviet-style apartment blocks if there already are enough houses built and empty. 

That, in a nutshell, is socialism. I recommend you read further because I probably made many involuntary mistakes, I am a medical student after all not a political scientist. As you can see, nothing about that implies authoritarianism or major changes to most people’s daily lives, there would still be similar jobs, you can keep all the nice things you have, and no one’s going after you for buying a nice car. However, when you pay your taxes and get free healthcare, free or cheap education and know that if you happen to lose your home the government will help you find a new one instead of treating you like a criminal parasite, life would be so much easier and comfortable. And sure, the democratization of the workplace means that businesses like Amazon won’t let a single person amass more money than the GDP of many countries, but no one will shed a tear for billionaires losing money, and hey if they happen to lose it all and go bankrupt even the former billionaires will have a house, healthcare and education for their kids. 

That was pretty long, but I found it more useful telling you what socialism is rather than the plethora of things it isn’t. There is still plenty of motivation to work in a socialist system, you still can have different wages, cars and houses, but you don’t need to worry about whether you get to feed your family or buy medicine for your uncle. As you said, socialism does indeed protect from “bad greedy corporate men”, but it doesn’t give the power to one man, it is up to every employee of a company to decide who leads them. Sure, absolute power corrupts single individuals, but not if that power is spread out amongst the people. Also, you keep saying that “the ills of society are from the people”, but what is your alternative to guaranteeing everyone has what they need to live and allowing them to grow?

But this has likely been influenced by COVID-19. Much focus has been on that, as opposed to Brexit. Though regarding preparation, I think what you’re suggesting is exaggerated; while stockpiling of certain medication is definitely reasonable (Due to the reliance on the UK to source such meds from the EU), stockpiling food isn’t too necessary. We have a lot of food that’s produced in the UK, so we won’t starve, and shops don’t operate with only what’s needed, they have a reserve as well, so that would last for some time.
Regarding electricity, I don’t think there’s too much to worry about, there may be a few issues, but I think clean water is a bigger concern? Given that we acquire much of our water purification materials from the EU, so some places may have water shortages. But in terms of power, I don’t imagine that would be too badly effected. The worst thing that would happen, would be some power cuts &amp; major price rises. Unfortunately, we import 40% of our gas from Norway/EU pipes, and 5-6% of our electricity from EU countries. This could mean that electricity costs could increase, and at worst in some cases, people go without power in some regions. Power cuts aren’t too common, but this would adversely affect people who are not financially stable; I personally could manage without power, as I have a car that I could use to charge my phone, and camping stoves, kettles, etc. to cook &amp; drink. I do most of my banking online, and with a phone, I can manage that. Personally, I don’t think power cuts would be a huge issue, maybe the occasional one, but nothing too bad. My concern would be OAP’s who need to stay warm, and people who can’t afford things &amp; may suffer with price hikes.
Safety isn’t something you can really manage that well, guns aren’t legal here, except Shotguns, but they’re rare, as they’re expensive &amp; involve a lot of paperwork. The NHS will go through tremendous strain, financially, through a lack of medical resources, and staff shortages. So medical care will suffer immensely. There may be a few protests, but I doubt riots would erupt, unless things got more serious, such as a continual deterioration, with the government refusing to listen (They don’t listen to begin with, so that’s actually not all that unlikely lmao). But I think people may take out more insurance, due to uncertainties, but I doubt there will be too much of an issue there. Though there were reports that No10 were planning on using the army to enforce people, in the case of a no-deal, so that’s pretty scary. Not sure if they still intend to do that.

Long story short, no, I’m not preparing much, as I think a lot of what you’ve described is not likely &amp; is mostly catastrophising. There will be consequences, but I wouldn’t exactly say it’s the end on England. In my opinion, it won’t feel like much is happening; people will go about their lives, but with a bigger financial strain on taxes, bills, and necessary products. There will also be shortages of certain things, such as medication, certain types of food, and minor power strain. But nothing that I would consider too big. Power cuts &amp; water shortages are possible, but I doubt they’d be too widespread, just pockets of the occasional struggle, which might be mitigated by transferring resources from a separate nearby water/power station, such as one county sharing power &amp; water to another.

The Roman Empire (Latin: Imperium Romanum [ɪmˈpɛri.ũː roːˈmaːnũː]; Koinē Greek: Βασιλεία τῶν Ῥωμαίων, romanized: Basileía tōn Rhōmaíōn) was the post-Republican period of ancient Rome. As a polity it included large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Northern Africa, and Western Asia ruled by emperors. From the accession of Caesar Augustus to the military anarchy of the third century, it was a principate with Italy as metropole of the provinces and the city of Rome as sole capital (27 BC – 286 AD). After the military crisis, the empire was ruled by multiple emperors who shared rule over the Western Roman Empire (based in Milan and later in Ravenna) and over the Eastern Roman Empire (also known as the Byzantine Empire; centred on Nicomedia and Antioch, later based in Constantinople).

Desde sexta tenho sintomas ligeiros (dor de cabeça, cansaço e diarreia) de covid e desde ontem já me sinto a 90% mas apareceu-me ""dificuldade respiratória ou falta de ar"" ligeira (4-5 vezes nas ultimas 24h).

Sou programador informatico e a minha empresa nunca nos deixou ir para teletrabalho (sim, já contactei a act 3 vezes, sempre com os emails e fotos da proibição de teletrabalho) e visto que nas 2 semanas antes de me aparecerem os sintomas não saí de casa sem ser para trabalhar, apanhei covid ou gripe no trabalho.

A minha questão prende-se com o facto da empresa estar a pedir que faça teste para poder voltar a trabalho presencial o mais rápido possivel e o teste custar 120€ quando apanhei o virus na empresa e ela me paga pouco mais que o salario minimo.

Não deveria fazer só o isolamento/teletrabalho pelos 10 dias recomendados pela dgs? ou estou a ser burro como sempre?

**Edit:**

Resultado da minha burrice:

Telefonei para a saude24 como aqui disseram e o que me foi dito é que posso continuar a fazer a vida normal, como já não tenho sintomas eles não fazem nada. Não preciso de triagens, testes ou mesmo isolamento, assim como pessoas que vivem comigo não precisam de se preocupar.

The only year EU fans thought we had a good chance of winning was 2019 (2018 was a surprise performance, no one expected that), and even then G2 was pretty close in doing that. can't say the same for NA teams who can't even meet the measly expectations from their fans to get out of groups 😂

Beeldenstorm in Dutch (roughly ""image storm"" or ""statue storm""), and Bildersturm in German (""image/statue storm"") are terms used for outbreaks of destruction of religious images that occurred in Europe in the 16th century, known in English as the Great Iconoclasm or Iconoclastic Fury. During these spates of iconoclasm, Catholic art and many forms of church fittings and decoration were destroyed in unofficial or mob actions by Calvinist Protestant crowds as part of the Protestant Reformation. Most of the destruction was of art in churches and public places. The Dutch term usually specifically refers to the wave of disorderly attacks in the summer of 1566 that spread rapidly through the Low Countries from south to north.

As much as I dislike readmitting the same homeless DKA patient every few months, it does make me feel better that if I need to be cared for in this country that people will try to do their best regardless of my financial situation or background. That if my loved ones need care they will be prioritised based on urgency and not on nepotism or ability to pay.

That’s so underfunded that the quality of care has suffered in the last decade. Where MH provision has disappeared. Where a GP is supposed to fix you in a ten minute appointment. (I know you’re all nice and isolated from the nasty side of the NHS in Anaesthesia) You’re really selling me on the NHS.

&gt;	And a more humane approach to healthcare that isn’t all about patient satisfaction/money/compensation. I don’t have to provide futile care to patients because relatives demand it and I worry it will affect my ‘bonus’. And patients who don’t demand interventions to get their money’s worth: I’ll admit patient expectations are different than they once were and some are incredibly entitled in the UK. However I’m not forced to make decisions based on their entitled attitudes.

TIL every country that isn’t the UK is the US.

&gt;	Decent pay. I laugh when UK doctors complain about shit pay. Go work in my home country where an intern genuinely makes less salary than the person wiping the floors of the hospital. Where bribery of doctors has been institutionalised and it’s normal to slip your GP an envelope of cash when you seen them. Consultants wages are in the top 1% of wage earners. A typical FY2 earns £45kpa, 50% more than the median national salary, just over a year after graduating uni. What educated professional field has all but guaranteed job security and pay progression?

I make £110k as a PGY5. If I worked British hours it would be £130k. Compared to that, it’s pretty shit.

&gt;	Intellectual/professional satisfaction. I can provide the care that I want to my patients without being limited by their insurance choices. I don’t have to work out what drug will be cheapest for their insurance and convince them to get their prescription filled, because it doesn’t matter to me. Equally I can practice the way I want and do the procedures I want that I think will provide optimum care for my patients. I don’t have to spend hours on the phone with some uneducated moron at their insurance company defending my reason to start CVVHDF. I don’t have to worry about compromising their care so that they can afford it.

“TIL every country that isn’t the UK is the US.”

&gt;	Professional roles/responsibilities. This is specific to the NHS/UK, but the role of anaesthetists are more well developed outside of theatres here than in some other countries. In the USA and parts of Europe the split between medical and surgical ICUs is more definite and anaesthetists are rarely seen outside of surgical ICUs. EM also has a more expanded role that do a lot more intubations/stabilisation/critical care than provided by my specialty. There isn’t an objectively better/worse option here, but personally I enjoy this work a lot myself and would be disappointed to be relegated only to theatres.

“TIL every country that isn’t the UK is the US.”

&gt;	The UK as a country and culture. The impact of where you live is more than just work. I’m an immigrant, and these days I feel closer to the UK than my home country. No matter how ridiculous the politics is here, it’s even worse back home, and no country is immune to political issues (not like there’s no controversy with Trump, Trudeau, or even the Aussies). I like British people and culture as a whole, the sarcastic wit of people, the complaints and bad weather. Like genuinely, I much prefer the milder climate in this country than the extreme heat and cold of back home. I hate snow.

You have different hadiths and 2 different people (Aish and her father) saying the same stuff. There are even nowadays islamic scholars that say: ""this behaviour is ok, after all who in their right mind wouldn't marry the prophet?""

The fact that muslim scholars are the loudest proponent of preserving the practice of child marriage speak volumes of what Islam actually teach more than any opinion.

That's rich. The US had, in conjunction with other powers, invaded the USSR from as early as its founding, and had whipped up a frenzy against all forms of leftism both at home and abroad, only tepidly accepting a temporary alliance to defeat Hitler. If your argument is ""the USSR started the Cold War by not letting America expand its sphere of influence abroad"", I could use the same argument but with the two switched.

&gt;You cant burn down every city in your path in south Korea on a war of brutal aggression, then whine when they fight back. The lives of every person in south korea was on the line. It was victory or a life of slavery.

And life wasn't already hell for the people of South Korea who were getting [massacred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodo_League_massacre) by their own [government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeju_uprising)? South Korea wasn't some liberal democracy wonderland, it was a [borderline fascist regime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilminism) that murdered way more than the North did. I'm not saying the North was right to invade the South, just that the people of the South would have gotten slavery either way.

&gt;Don't invade US allied regimes and this would not be a problem.

Maybe those allied regimes shouldn't have been set up in the first place? Have you ever considered that the war started as a civil war in the South (a remnant of French colonialism, btw) because an election which was [supposed to be held](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Geneva_Conference) by treaty determining the fate of the country was never approved of by the South, therefore rendering it illegitimate? You can't just invade a country, set up a massively unpopular puppet dictatorship, and then blame the other half of the country for fighting back. In fact, you seem to agree with me here, considering how you were in favour of Western forces funneling money to democratic resistance groups in socialist Eastern Europe. Why not here?

&gt;Alaine bought Russian tanks, nationalized US assets on the grounds of ""limiting foreign influence"" all while letting the Soviets invest to their hearts content.

This sequencing of events is quite disingenuous. Chile nationalised its copper, to which Washington responded by basically giving Chile the cold shoulder. Chile was then forced to look for economic support elsewhere and found it in the USSR, and even then Allende received a lot less support than other socialist nations received.

&gt;The US was not going to let Chile turn into a repeat of Cuba.

So you're literally justifying overthrowing democracy and installing brutal dictators in their place because ""muh socialism bad""? And please do note that the only reason Cuba became the way it was was because the US supported Bautista's dictatorial regime.

The only part of your analogy that is helpful is the part where something happened in another part of the world, that had a knock on effect. I totally accept that the financial crash of 07 /08 started in the USA and spread to other places. However the notion that dinosaurs knew about asteroids or indeed about economics is ludicrous. They don’t and a crucial part of this is that the UK banking sector were meant to self regulate and they were meant to understand the field they were working in. To my knowledge a dinosaur doesn’t understand astrophysics or have a concept of money and theres just the small matter of dinosaurs and the Great Depression being 65 million years apart, I’m referring something that Thatcher did in the mid 1980’s and happened in 2007/2008, so forgive me for not really buying into what you are saying here. 

As you like playing with analogies, we could possibly use an analogy of the three little pigs -building houses out of straw, wood and brick. The economic crash can been the big bad wolf, or the little piggies burning candles in their houses, the house of straw burning down quickly, spreading onto the wooden house but not the house of stone. That one was more protected and it is less of a risk for that piggy to burn a candle in it. The piggy’s like the banking sector wilfully took a risk and made poor judgements. They played with fire and eventually burned down the house. The point is that the UK banking sector oversaw itself and should have been responsible, able to calculate  and judge risks, but it didn’t, it brought candles into a house made of straw. The German banking sector along with other European countries always thought the UK banking sectors approach was reckless and socially irresponsible, it was. 

Thatcher was directly responsible for: abolishing minimum fixed commissions on trades; abolishing exchange controls; ending the separation between those who traded stocks and shares and those who advised investor and for allowing foreign firms to own UK brokers. She very much started the ball rolling with these changes and effectively created a boom or bust culture in the London Financial sector. And there were firms, UK sector firms that went bust during Thatcher’s time. 

The deregulation allowed US investment banks and other foreign investment banks to gain international dominance, as they simply moved into London and overtook, swallowed up, the UK based investment banks. For those that did survive it created a network of financial products that entwined global products together, so if one little piggy started lighting a candle in its straw house, then fire could easily spread to another straw house, that’s how we arrived at the financial crash of 2007 / 2008 and that’s why it effected the UK so much. 

Thatcher created a culture of just of deregulation, one that valued high risk, one that wasn’t concerned about the consequences or the impact of financial irresponsibility. She’d probably label it as efficient business that builds prosperity, however it was cut throat. That 80’s culture of get rich fast die young, of the yuppie, it wasn’t just a New York thing. It was very much part of London as well. 

The other aspect of this is Thatcher’s ‘right to buy’ scheme which saw council houses sold on the cheap and the stock of property not replaced, which forced house prices up as demand rose. She effectively created a housing bubble. She also crushed trade unions, so everyday workers wages did not increase. This led to people being unable to afford mortgages so a deregulated UK banking sector started to offer up 115% to 125% mortgages. 

It would be absolutely fair and valid to say that Major and Blair, followed her and they also did very little to curtail this sector.

Interestingly, yes, this is one of the factors. ""Faith only"" or ""sola fide"" is one core battle cry of Protestantism or Christianity of the Reformatory tradtion. The notion that you need ""only faith"" ""to accept Jesus as your Lord an saviour"" is heavily emphazised and supported Christianity of the Reformatory tradtion and exspecially in US Christianity. US Christianity is predominantly rooted in the Reformatory tradtion, regardless of Protestants, Baptists, Reformed or Calvinist Christians, Methodists etc. and even US Catholicism is somewhat influenced by this Christianity, eg. I know that some Catholic parents in predominantly non-Catholics areas in the US send their children to Protestant bible groups or even Sunday school.

European Christianity is predominantly Roman Catholic and Lutheran (GB, of course is Anglican) and Orthodox in Eastern Europe. Roman Catholic theology since Vatican II recognises the possiblity that every human being has the possibility of being saved – even without being a Catholic or a Christian at all. A view that to my knowledge is common amonf a lot of Lutheran Christians as well. The big Lutheran churches, which are located in Switzerland, Germany and Scandinavia (including the Netherlands), are predominantly progressive Christians, some Christians would even identify as ""atheist Christians"" – and in comparison to US Christians they're ""worse than lukewarm"" – but confident about it. Of course there are also more strict or fundamentalist Christians, eg. in the Netherlands, but overall, fundamentalism and biblical literalism and inerrancy isn't a mainstream issue in European Christianity, but a more or less minority issue.

So, the landscape of Christianity is very different and so are the discourses.

European Christians are not really missionary people, Catholics eg. don't do apologetics on Protestants and Protestants don't try to convince atheists or agnostics. That's a bad social behaviour in our societies and is not encouraged or supported at all.

OP's expectations reflect US American apologetic discourse which today seems to be mainly about the question ""does God exist (and if, who is she?)"" and involves prehistoric arguments like the Kalam or other mere philosophical stuff. These kind of discourses don't exist in continental Europe at all (sometimes in the UK to my knowledge, as Dawkins, of course, is British, like Stephen ""Rationality Rules"" Woodford \[?\], who seems to adress a mainly US/UK audience?). There are some in the ivory tower of academic analytical theology, but this doesn't really count. I would argue that there is a common sense, that religious ideas are not like theories of natural sciences and can't be compared (including the notion that, of course, creationism isn't a theory with any scientific merit, but evolution is).

That's, in a nutshell, my take on it.",True,False,False,,,,0,1606905002,,False,0,{},gecu25s,False,t3_k4qfzq,False,True,t1_gecq1rm,/r/DebateAChristian/comments/k4qfzq/the_christian_has_the_burden_of_demonstration/gecu25s/,False,,1618121175,0,True,False,DebateAChristian,t5_2ryd5,r/DebateAChristian,public,,0,[],

This is the crux of the issue. Civil Servants lack specialism or have to be pulled out of specialist role where (presumably) they are needed. 

Outsourcing to private companies is a great thing when done well, as it enables experts to be dropped onto a project when they are needed. The issue is not in the reliance on outsourcing (often better than trying to do internally) it is the process. 

I have worked for years in companies who tender for public contracts, and I can tell you that at every level there is unfairness and cronyism (witnessed this from both sides). There are UK and EU regs on the selection process, but they are both shit and ignored. 

What we need is for the person who signs a contact off in the public sector to be responsible for the result. In the private sector, if you fuck up outsourcing then it is on your head.

Il y a quand même 47% des gens qui pensent qu'il y a eu de la fraude et/ou des irrégularités. Quand on voit le détail, genre  
machines de votes connectées à internet,  
logiciel propriétaire,  
qui ne fait aucun log et ne peut pas être audité *par design* (! c'te blague),  
 
que les actionnaires majeurs de la société qui fabrique et vend les machines de vote sont des grands politiciens eux-mêmes,  
renvoyer les observateurs faire dodo en prétextant qu'il n'y aura plus de comptage pendant la nuit puis continuer à compter, et le lendemain matin voir qu'il y a eu 98.5% pour Biden le faisant rattraper des retards massifs,  
que le parti républicain a gagné quasiment toutes les élections ""down ballot"" mais que bizarrement le chef perd en haut du ballot,  
que beaucoup de ballots avaient juste Biden en haut et rien en dessous pour le parti démocrate, juste vide,  
le fait que tous les médias quasiment disaient qu'il y avait risque de fraude électorale depuis 20 ans (y compris Obama en 2008) mais que depuis 2017 la moitié côté démocrate a complètement retourné son discours genre ""non aucun risque tout est parfait"" et au final gagnent les mid-terms et la présidentielle qui suit,  
etc etc etc

...

Je veux dire on en sait rien pour cette élection d'ici à 10 000 km, et Biden a sûrement gagné. 

Mais la vérité la plus claire c'est que JAMAIS on n'accepterait de telles conditions en Europe et dans la plupart des démocraties du monde. C'est juste inacceptables comme façon de gérer des élections. C'est un peu le tiers-monde à ce stade, juste les faits (les règles, la procédure), avant même l'élection et de parler d'une quelconque fraude. 

Nous, ce serait ici, je le répète on serait vraiment déjà outrés du dixième de ce qui s'est passé cette année. Et toute personne qui a fait un peu de science politique voit que c'est très, très louche statistiquement (cette année c'est en faveur des démocrates, mais dans l'histoire ça a pu être dans les deux sens). Rappelez-vous Bush en 2000.

Rien que le vote massif par mail, on l'a interdit en France en 1975 (et c'est interdit à une telle échelle dans l'immense majorité des pays démocratiques), parce qu'on sait, c'est démontré, que c'est trop sujet à la fraude. Rappelez-vous, en mars ici, on a fait l'élection normalement, pas par courrier... c'est illégal ici de toute façon, heureusement, mais inquiétez-vous si un jour ça devient généralisé à des millions de votants.

Moi ce qui m'inquiète en soi pour les USA c'est qu'ils ont réussi à tellement décrédibiliser l'élection présidentielle pour l'opinion publique (des votants démocrates comme républicains), ils risquent de s'exposer au fait que les gens en majorité n'y croient plus. Et ça c'est vraiment, vraiment grave pour leur pays. Peu importe qui perd qui gagne, l'un des buts essentiels est de préserver la démocratie en elle-même. Et les deux partis ont fait de la merde à ce sujet, depuis des années.

Franchement, le perdant marquant cette année, c'est la démocratie américaine, et la volonté du peuple (plus aucun des deux partis ne s'occupe des pauvres et des travailleurs, les deux sont serviteurs des grands donateurs, les PAC, enfin les ultra-riches et les élites type Wall Street / Silicon Valley / militaro-industrial complex càd les fabricants d'armes et contrats divers avec le gvt) ; et le gagnant c'est donc la puissance de manipulation des opinions par les médias et les politiques, les ""élites"" du fric.

Genocide is the intentional action to destroy a people—usually defined as an ethnic, national, racial, or religious group—in whole or in part. A term coined by Raphael Lemkin in his 1944 book Axis Rule in Occupied Europe, the hybrid word genocide is a combination of the Greek word γένος (genos, ""race, people"") and the Latin suffix -caedo (""act of killing"").The United Nations Genocide Convention, which was established in 1948, defines genocide as ""acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, as such"" including the killing of its members, causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group, deliberately imposing living conditions that seek to ""bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part"", preventing births, or forcibly transferring children out of the group to another group.Examples include the Holocaust, the Armenian Genocide, and the Rwandan genocide. The Political Instability Task Force estimated that, between 1956 and 2016, a total of 43 genocides took place, causing the death of about 50 million people. The UNHCR estimated that a further 50 million had been displaced by such episodes of violence up to 2008.

In most cases, I don't think anyone consciously picks something to be feminine, or masculine.

Although often (not always), they tend to emphasize that gender's traits. For example, high heels emphasize a women's butt. To the extent that butt's are considered a desirable thing for women, high heels go with that. And over time, people see that women wear them, so they associate it with women.

High heels are a good example of that. Originally, they were invented for men on horseback. Eventually that got adopted by European aristocracy as fashion (it showed you owned horses), and were worn by both genders. Over time, the patterns diverged with different styles for men and women. And eventually it fell out of fashion for men as impractical.



&gt; Are those differences based on something else than social structure ? I mean can you objectivly explain why this is feminine and this isn't ?

No. That's why people say gender is a ""social construct"". It's completely arbitrary, in that sense.

Indeed, you even see that in real life- some things that are feminine in some cultures, are masculine in others.

For example, in current Western culture, pink is currently associated with femininity. But in the past, it was a masculine color. There's no objective thing that caused that switch.

And that's the focus on not being mean to people/treating them unfairly. It doesn't really make sense to treat someone that way for something completely arbitrary. It's fine to have different common things among genders because people find it attractive or whatever, but there's no reason to punish people who bend/break those norms.",True,False,False,,,,0,1606912606,,1606912847,0,{},ged1sef,False,t3_k57lwf,False,True,t1_ged0yni,/r/changemyview/comments/k57lwf/cmv_transgenderism_and_feminism_cant_cohabitate/ged1sef/,False,,1618124782,2,True,False,changemyview,t5_2w2s8,r/changemyview,public,,0,[],

Agora sobre essa coisa de se apossar da Lua, nós temos que considerar algumas coisas, 1º-mano quem seria o aleijado mental pra roba a POHA DA LUA MANO

2º- o acordo de país é baseado em diplomacia o que significa que todas as decisões envolvendo propriedades globais em terras sem proprietário (sendo eles governamentais ou próprios), ou seja, se um babaca resolvesse quebra A POHA DE UM ACORDO GLOBAL DE MAIS DE 50 ANOS, isso iria gerar um revolta global que pode até se tornar um guerra

3º- De fato você está certo dizendo que ninguém pode se apossar da lua, mas a verdadeira justificativa é que perante a nossa amiguinha (que já foi mencionado 300 vezes aqui) a lei marítima proíbe a posse espontânea de um lugar desocupado, já descoberto, sem um acordo (que por sinal envolve MUITO dinheiro, levando em conta que seria como comprar uma ilha, só que ela é COLOSSAL e fica no espaço)

4º- a única forma de um país ""ter"" a posse de lua legalmente seria usando o princípio Uti Possidetis iuris que consiste em um  direito internacional segundo o qual os que de fato ocupam um território possuem direito sobre este, e isso inclui a administração de despesas, e o mais importante: a ocupação funcional e majoritária do território, mas para aplicar esse prinípio a Lua deveria ser considerada como terreno, e convenhamos, se agente conseguiu ir para lá 11 vezes, ainda vai demorar muito tempo pra gente poder popular a lua e construir armas intergalácticas pra PUTA GUERRA QUE VAI ROLAR pra ver quem fica com ela.

Człowiek Browar nie może się pogodzić z faktem, ze znowu przegrał merytoryczną  dyskusje na temat Hołowni, jego komenty zostały usunięte, więc jego ego wzrosło tak wysoko, że musiał od nowa wywołać dyskusję. Oczywiście wszystkie argumenty (merytoryczne i sprawdzone) zostały wyjebane do kosza, bufor pamięci został skasowany bo ja wiem lepiej Hołownia to ....(wklej dowolny epitet)
2. Jestem słuchaczem Hołowni od kampanii wyborczej i pamiętam, że **krytykował zmniejszenie wieku emerytalnego,** ponieważ przez to emerytury są **obniżone i niskie**, a przyszłość **ZUSu** jest **zagrożone**. Nie dość że OP opiera fakty na nijakim komentarzu nieznanej dla mnie osoby, to jeszcze jest to ściek-twitter od którego aż roi się od trolerki, dezinformacji i toxyczności. Po trzecie dowód anegdotyczny: ktoś coś powiedział ktoś coś tam wie i bawimy się w głuchy telefon
3. Znowu bawisz się OPie w cherry picking, wywołując jakiś marginalny temat na obecny stan rzeczy. Mamy pandemie, mamy problem z praworządnością w kraju, zagrożone są środki EU, stan służby zdrowia jest krytyczny, ludzie tracą bliskich, pracę, kasę, ciągle są protesty a OP wychodzi z obniżeniem wieku emerytalnego. Hołownia od dłuższego czasu skupia się na tych problemach a ty wyciągasz jakąś tam rozmowę prawdopodobnie z kampanii prezydenckiej.
4. Tak skrajne rozwiązania jak obniżenie/podwyższenie wieku emerytalnego jest na tyle tematem drażliwym, że Hołownia na pewno będzie chciał spokojnej dyskusji, dogłębnej analizy i rozmowy z narodem na ten temat. Hołownia to nie Kaczyński, on będzie chciał w takich tematach dialogu i normalnej legislacji nie-ekspresowej tylko rzetelnej. Zawsze to tłumaczył ale beton robi swoje i nie dociera.
5. Oczywiście sprawdziłem to w **programie prezydenckim Hołowni** i kwestie emerytalne są wyjaśnione dogłębnie:

&gt;Od 2000 r. liczba emerytów wzrosła o 41% z 4,6 milionów do prawie 6,5 milionów w 2019 r. Jest to wzrost rzędu 41%. Dane ZUS wskazują, że jeśli utrzymają się obecne trendy, w 2050 r. na każde 100 osób w wieku produkcyjnym będą przypadały 52 osoby w wieku emerytalnym. Aż jedną trzecią populacji naszego kraju będą stanowiły osoby powyżej 65 roku życia.  (...)  
&gt;  
&gt;Godna emerytura. Los inicjatywy z 2012 r. pokazał, że nie należy automatycznie zmieniać wieku emerytalnego. Zamiast tego należy pozwolić każdemu obywatelowi w wieku emerytalnym zdecydować, czy chce pracować dłużej, by jego emerytura była wyższa. Państwo powinno oferować ulgi podatkowe firmom tworzącym miejsca pracy dla seniorów. Jestem za wprowadzeniem minimalnej emerytury w wysokości co najmniej 50% płacy minimalnej i rozważeniem podwyższenia kwoty wolnej od podatku, aby ograniczać obciążenie podatkowe emerytów. W celu zrównania praw emerytów należy umożliwić również rolnikom odchodzącym na emeryturę kontynuowanie pracy.

Together with the fact that suburban rail stock in the US seems to be built way more sturdy and heavier. This means that the current technology will probably needs some more development for the US market.
Another factor that will kinda put a damper on development is the focus on rush hour service in US suburban rail. This means less usage so initial investment price is more important than operating costs (per km).

**Info about the Mod:** The Mod is an Alternate-History Mod, that is 99.00% Historical Accurate UNTIL 1936, from there everything starts going strange, what kind of strange? Well, the Mod's plot follows the Nationalistic and Monarchist minds of the People, people who felt backstabbed by Politicians that only want power from themselves, that's why the Mod has 2 Main Ideologies, Monarchist - Authoritarian and Fascist - Nationalist, the mod will probably include Democratic Branches someday, but until then that's what we have, the Communist Branches will be rare but abundant (Sorry for not giving you this possibility). It's up to you if you want to try out this mod, or just scroll down.   We are also looking for Coders and Writers, so if you enjoy our mod, please be welcome to apply! Ghost out.

In an unusually blunt statement, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which is in charge of approving Covid-19 vaccines for the EU, said its longer approval procedure was more appropriate. It said it was based on more evidence and required more checks than the emergency procedure chosen by Britain...

&gt;""I consider this decision to be problematic and recommend that EU member states do not repeat the process in the same way,"" said MEP Peter Liese, who is a member of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's party. ""A few weeks of thorough examination by the European Medicines Agency is better than a hasty emergency marketing authorisation of a vaccine,"" said Mr Liese, who represents the centre right grouping, the largest in the EU Parliament.

Where should I file my complaints next time I see a dude with Latvian flair say that ""Russians are planning to come in and will send all Latvians to Siberia after concentrating them on Arena Riga"" or something equally retarded?

If this was in a website that operated in Latvia you could very well report that comment to DP, and they would remove it. Like i was 9 years old and it was the late 2000s and i got several of my comments removed by the DP for saying essentially ""rUssIaNs eBiL"", thats how i got the DP talk with my parents and got called retarded, because you can seriously get in trouble with them like that. We literally had ""report to DP"" button which both sides would mash :D

But on reddit there is really nothing you can do, I mean, could Germans contact Russias state services over a reddit comment which said ""aLl gErmaNs fAsCiSt dOgS"". But I'm sure a russian could report one of the minorities who talk trash in their own country.

&gt;And that's not even mentioning outright Nazi shit like this, though admittedly it's an Estonian.

To be fair he said the country not it's people, but I do think his comment is stupid. Theres crazier shit said on both sides in local fringe communities, trust me. :D

I can tell you a story about a latvian nationalist (rightfully) getting fucked over by the DP. So there was this one guy Linards Grantiņš, he was an independence activist during late 80s and a founding member of the human rights group Helsinki 86, but his activities got cut short because he was arrested by the Soviets. Basically, he wont admit this, but close people to him say he got mentally fucked up in the prison, because of some (admittedly light) torture and sexual humiliation. Years later he lives in Germany and writes crazy articles about how the fucking KGB operates as a fifth collumn in the latvian government, basically complete racist nonsense. DP requisted he be extradited, but Germany refused because he was clearly just demented. I dont remember well, but I think he returned to Latvia for a short visit and the DP snatched him, broke his arm in the process and cuffed said broken arm to the roof of the car, later not giving any medical attention for 2 days. Obviously if this happened to a Russian, he would be portrayed as a martyr, the victim of the Latvian nazi state, but this went quite unnoticed in the news, just some small articles. The funny thing is this guy, right after independence, received one of the highest decorations, the Thre Star order, and that still didnt protect him from the DP.

Huh? The Ohio Constitution mandates that gas taxes are for road construction. Before I was a Mayor I was a Township Trustee and the gas tax revenue is easily the largest revenue source for road repair.

&gt; I made a claim for it to be a substitute for a carbon tax. A carbon tax is also not the end all solution but one of many possible tools. High gas taxes have been incorporated into pretty much all European nations successfully for both environmental and fiscal reasons so there is a well established model. The failure to raise the gas tax to the necessary level to meet needs is on the government. 

I'm sorry but it's such a cop out to say ""well in Europe..."" because the US and Europe are very different places. The inertia of bad policies is huge in this country and you'd be thrown out of the room if you said ""well high gas taxes are a good thing"" to an automobile **dependent** society.

&gt;As the mayor why not negotiate being able to sell net metered power? Moving with the current trends instead of fighting them. 

Because my population makes up 0.0001% if the state on a good day lol AMP is not one to take orders from a village Mayor.

&gt;Public power Utilities will fail, our aging infrastructure and maintenance costs and regulatory restriction will make it happen and personal solar will not be a significant portion of the cause.  Dozens of studies both private and publicly funded generally found the net metering was either of no impact or actually beneficial to Utilities here’s a complied evaluation.

&gt;I guarantee I live in a town with more rooftop systems then you (Athens) and we have tremendous amounts of trees in our neighborhoods. We even have a governmental body the Shade tree commission to maintain our urban frest. It is very plausible and practical. 

Glad to hear it.

&gt;I really want to reiterate the point that protectionism will not save these relics. even on your local level it won’t.

The drug regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), has granted emergency authorisation to the vaccine made by Pfizer, an American pharmaceutical giant, and BioNTech, a smaller German firm. Trials have shown that the vaccine has an efficacy of 95%. Ugur Sahin, head of BioNTech, said the decision would reduce people in the high-risk population being hospitalised. The firms anticipate further such decisions in the coming days and weeks, and say it marks an historic milestone in the fight against covid-19.
&gt;
&gt;Britain has ordered 40m doses of the mRNA vaccine, known as BNT162b2. The regulator’s decision will trigger the release of supplies. These are expected to come from a manufacturing site in Puurs, Belgium, and will be delivered in stages this year and throughout 2021. Britain has also told hospitals to be ready to distribute the vaccine as soon as December 7th. In the interim, Britain’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation will have to make a final decision on the priority groups for vaccination—such as health-care workers and those at high-risk from covid-19.
&gt;
&gt;The speed with which the vaccine is moving through regulatory systems is due to the rolling reviews that have been under way for some time. Instead of waiting for pharmaceutical firms to collate and submit a full data and safety package, regulators have been reviewing results as they become available. In a statement a week ago, the MHRA said that “no covid-19 vaccine would be authorised until it has demonstrated safety, quality and efficacy through a robust clinical trial programme”.
&gt;
&gt;Even so, Britain has moved remarkably quickly. On December 1st the head of America’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was summoned to the White House to answer questions on why his agency has not moved faster to approve BNT162b2. The move will also fuel concern that Britain’s rapid movement is political, and might even be an example of “regulatory nationalism”—ie, countries moving quickly to approve vaccines in order to jump ahead of the queue for deliveries.
&gt;
&gt;Britain is home to a small, but well-regarded, medicines agency. Nevertheless, both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency have arranged public meetings in the coming weeks at which covid-19 vaccines will be discussed—ahead of regulatory approval. Melanie Ivarsson, chief development officer at Moderna, which announced highly encouraging results for its own mRNA vaccine a week after Pfizer and BioNTech, said these were important, as they allow independent experts to look at the safety and the analysis, and for the public to ask questions, something that will build confidence in these vaccines. “We want people to feel really comfortable,” says Dr Ivarsson.
&gt;
&gt;Vaccine experts are optimistic about the general safety of the mRNA vaccine platform. Although this is the first time an mRNA vaccine has been authorised for human use, mRNA vaccines have been tested for various applications in cancer for over a decade. The BNT162b2 vaccine, as well as Moderna’s, have now been in trials comprising 73,000 volunteers. Half of these would have been given active vaccine. In clinical-trial terms, this is a hefty dataset. Both vaccines have been well tolerated with no serious adverse events.
&gt;
&gt;Although a large number of patients have been tested, health authorities have already constructed safety follow-up plans, says Penny Ward, chair of the education and standards committee of the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Medicine, a charity. These include a system for following up adverse reactions, and using anonymised health-care records to see how the incidence of disease varies between those who have been vaccinated and those who have not. One hypothetical concern with any new vaccine is that it may make the risk of infection worse in some groups. Another is that in rare cases vaccines can trigger autoimmune reactions. Viral infections can do this too.
&gt;
&gt;There are, though, also hypothetical reasons to think that mRNA vaccines might actually be safer than some other kinds of vaccine. Live vaccines, for example, are weakened versions of the virus itself, but there is a risk that the virus will revert to a more dangerous form. With covid-19 vaccines being delivered to hundreds of millions, and then billions, of people, a great deal of surveillance will be needed.
&gt;
&gt;The Pfizer vaccine delivers a strand of genetic material—mRNA—encapsulated in tiny spheres of fat. This mRNA directs human cells to produce a piece of the virus, the spike protein, inside the human body. From here the body mounts an immune response. Because the protein is manufactured in situ, the body sees this protein in exactly the same way that it would see the virus itself.
&gt;
&gt;And mRNA is a natural component of living cells, which is made and destroyed regularly every day. Its turnover is measured in days. Once the mRNA from the vaccine is delivered into the body it will prime the immune system and then be broken down. The inherent instability of mRNA is why the Pfizer vaccine needs to be kept frozen at less than -70°C. Misinformation has also been spread about the vaccine. One falsehood is that it will alter DNA. This is more than a little unlikely. The “central dogma” of molecular biology is that genetic information flows from DNA, through to RNA, and then to make proteins. For RNA to alter DNA it would have to break this biological axiom.
&gt;
&gt;Having moved so quickly, the MHRA, and the British government, will be under pressure to convince the public that the regulator has made a good decision. That may be easier in Britain where polls say 79% of people intend to take a covid-19 vaccine, above the international average. In America, by contrast, only 64% say the same. Ultimately all decisions to approve medicines are taken on the balance of risks versus benefits. For vaccines the benefits always have to vastly outweigh the possible risks, simply because, unlike drugs, they are given to healthy people. Although it would have been useful to know what factors the MHRA took when weighing the decision to grant emergency authorisation, one brutal calculation may have been foremost in regulators’ minds: each day of waiting is measured in lost lives.",True,False,False,,,,0,1606920637,,False,0,{},gedg6an,True,t3_k5akh8,True,True,t3_k5akh8,/r/ukpolitics/comments/k5akh8/britain_becomes_the_first_country_to_license_a/gedg6an/,False,,1618131516,1,True,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,r/ukpolitics,public,,0,[],

Japan invaded China 3 years before Germany invaded Poland and it was a major scenario in the war.

B: It's one of the causes of A), Japan being pissed off by Versailles was very minor compared to Germany. We can debate endlessly if Mussolini would have not risen to power if Italy would have gotten everything she wanted from Versailles (essentially the Dalmatian coast). On the other hand, without Hilter it's very likely Mussolini would have been another Franco and remained peaceful (in Europe) forever. Even the invasion of Ethiopia without Germany also challenging the world order would have been unlikely.

D: It's probably the only wrong answer. The opposite of ""Inaction of Allies"" would have meant UK and France attacking Germany between 1936-1938... That would have triggered a War in any case that very likely we would still have called World War 2 as probably would still have dragged Italy and the USSR in the conflict and with Japan already deep in China history would have followed a similar path (maybe a faster win by the Allies?)

C: It's the most convincing one. The Great Depression led to Hitler rise to power in Germany. The Weimar Republic after 10 turbulent years was finally stabilising. If I'm not mistaken even Hitler once said that he cried the day of the Crash of Wall Street because he understood that was the ""big break"" for him and the Nazis. Furthermore the Great Depression weakened the British and French readiness/willingness for War, favoured the rise of more fascist regimes and accelerated the issues in Spain and China.

I respect that you don't believe gods are real but I'm spiritual and immensely honour the gods + Spirits that influenced my ancestral lineage and continue to guide me despite all the obstacles that i and our collective body are continuing to face. It's disheartnening to hear you speaking the words of colonisers and stating that Nigeria is a 'third world' country which is very far from the truth. If it is so 'third world' and lacking in resources I'd love to know why white people decided to come and exploit us and are continuing to destroy the economy of our country. Corruption and mass destruction was direcrly imported by the British, Portuguese - basically the entirety of Europe's 'scramble for Africa' as it is commonly referred to. 

In my Ijo ancestry, the many gods including water spirits are actually seen as having human qualities and are not perfect by any means, maybe this is why the gods could not stop the evils and foreign tactics of the colonisers. There was a heightened emphasis on regular veneration of ancestors and relationship building with them to conjure Spirit. Maybe the sudden imposition of christianity somehow effectively removed any kind of communication with these imperfect Spirits, making them unable to help us. 

Also there were many entheogenic plant allies we were using often to connect to these gods, Spirits and ancestors such as Iboga and Psilocybin mushrooms,  which dissolved the ego, induced fearlessness and were used for spiritual initiation. They even helped in creating bonds within marriages, families and village relationships. Perhaps the loss of these healing medicines and the perpetuation of the British sentiment that we were 'primitive' and using 'dangerous drugs' (see the war on drugs in the US today, and unfair incarceration of african americans) also stopped us from being able to combat their brutal force and come together on a collective scale to be able to help each other in humane and vulenrable ways. Following the ego driven and capitalist ways of the coloniser instead. 

The intention of this post was not solely to tie the loss of traditional practices to the reasons why the government is crap. There are myriad of reasons why the Nigerian government is crap and most of that has to do with colonisation.

From the best I can figure we are about at $30 million worth of Prius cats stolen since January in Portland. The problem is not the police. If they arrest the people they just get let out. Our whole justice system is completely broken because we have tried to do the right thing and not imprison people for petty bullshit. Unfortunately that has created a whole bunch of people like this that are committing theft one (felony) and they get a ride downtown, get let out, and go steal cats again the next night. 

Seen one cat shield cut off. That particular car was left behind a warehouse in an industrial area for a week.

I own Atomic Auto and we have had 10 towed in this week. It’s fucking disgusting. Please click the link on the above website and we are going to keep working on getting a different law and enacted to regulate the scrap.

What you can do in the meantime is take pictures of these fuckers. We need pictures of their cars and we need pictures of them. There is somebody at the Portland police bureau actually working on this and I can pass the information on. Last week some other business owners and I were talking to people from the DAs office. The only way to solve this problem is to make so much fucking noise that our elected officials actually have to do their jobs and help us.

Between my business and myself I’ve been hit nine times this year by catalytic converter theft. 5-15 a week towed into Atomic Auto. Nothing will happen to change it until every prius cat has been stolen, and we have taken away the food for the rats. I have told people that I have spoken with about this in government that every single prius cat in the United States we stolen before this is over. It started in San Francisco and spread up here. I have a video of Eastern European mafia buying these things from junkies filling up their garage and then when the garage is full they leave the state in a Penske. Unless you can prove that they are stolen they are committing no crime.

The US's stance on circumcision and it's claimed benefits is extremely biased and based on pretty flawed science. Most medical organizations around the world have come about against the practice.






Circumcision is unconsentual Genital Mutilation. It's a serious human rights violation






#[Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS) (2015)](https://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision)
*The CPS does not recommend the routine circumcision of every newborn male. It further states that when “medical necessity is not established, …interventions should be deferred until the individual concerned is able to make their own choices.”*



#[Royal Dutch Medical Association (KNMG) (2010)](https://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/knmg-non-therapeutic-circumcision-of-male-minors-27-05-2010.pdf)

*The KNMG states “there is no convincing evidence that circumcision is useful or necessary in terms of prevention or hygiene.” It regards the non-therapeutic circumcision of male minors as a violation of physical integrity, and argues that boys should be able to make their own decisions about circumcision.*


#[The Royal Australasian College of Physicians (RACP) (2010)](https://www.racp.edu.au/docs/default-source/advocacy-library/circumcision-of-infant-males.pdf)
*The RACP states that routine infant circumcision is not warranted in Australia and New Zealand. It argues that, since cutting children involves physical risks which are undertaken for the sake of merely psychosocial benefits or debatable medical benefits, it is ethically questionable whether parents ought to be able to make such a decision for a child.*

#[British Medical Association (BMA) (2006](https://www.bma.org.uk/advice-and-support/ethics/children-and-young-people/non-therapeutic-male-circumcision-toolkit)
*The BMA considers that the evidence concerning health benefits from non-therapeutic circumcision is insufficient as a justification for doing it. It suggests that it is “unethical and inappropriate” to circumcise for therapeutic reasons when effective and less invasive alternatives exist.*

#[Expert statement from the German Association of Pediatricians (BVKJ) (2012)](https://www.arclaw.org/wp-content/uploads/BVKJ-statement-official-translation.pdf)
*In testimony to the German legislature, the President of the BVKJ has stated, “there is no reason from a medical point of view to remove an intact foreskin from …boys unable to give their consent.” It asserts that boys have the same right to physical integrity as girls in German law, and, regarding non-therapeutic circumcision, that parents’ right to freedom of religion ends at the point where the child’s right to physical integrity is infringed upon.*

#Cultural Bias in the American Pediatric Association's Technical Report and Policy Statement on Male Circumcision




*The AAP’s extensive report was based on the scrutiny of a large number of complex scientific articles. Therefore, while striving for objectivity, the conclusions drawn by the 8 task force members reflect what these individual physicians perceived as trustworthy evidence. Cultural bias reflecting the normality of nontherapeutic male circumcision in the United States seems obvious. The conclusions of the AAP Technical Report and Policy Statement are far from those reached by physicians in most other Western countries. As mentioned, only 1 of the aforementioned arguments has some theoretical relevance in relation to infant male circumcision; namely, the questionable argument of UTI prevention in infant boys. The other claimed health benefits are also questionable, weak, and likely to have little public health relevance in a Western context, and they do not represent compelling reasons for surgery before boys are old enough to decide for themselves. Circumcision fails to meet the commonly accepted criteria for the justification of preventive medical procedures in children. The cardinal medical question should not be whether circumcision can prevent disease, but how disease can best be prevented.*

*The AAP report lacks a serious discussion of the central ethical dilemma with, on 1 side, parents’ right to act in the best interest of the child on the basis of cultural, religious, and health-related beliefs and wishes and, on the other side, infant boys’ basic right to physical integrity in the absence of compelling reasons for surgery. Physical integrity is 1 of the most fundamental and inalienable rights a child has. Physicians and their professional organizations have a professional duty to protect this right, irrespective of the gender of the child.*

*There is growing consensus among physicians, including those in the United States, that physicians should discourage parents from circumcising their healthy infant boys because nontherapeutic circumcision of underage boys in Western societies has no compelling health benefits, causes postoperative pain, can have serious long-term consequences, constitutes a violation of the United Nations’ Declaration of the Rights of the Child, and conflicts with the Hippocratic oath: primum non nocere: First, do no harm.*

Heck, even in North America you have Canada &amp; The US doing costumes and candy whereas Mexico celebrates Dia de los Muertos; which is far more in line with the Christian Traditions of All Hollows Eve (30/10) / All Hollows Day (1/11) / All Souls Day (2/11) vs. the suspected Pagan/Harvest Traditions in modern UK/Ireland historians believe to be the roots of Halloween as we know it today (Keep in Mind Early Christians often moved their Holy Days to fall in line w/ Pagan Holidays to avoid Persecution by the Roman Empire).

Many Cultures globally have many different views/meanings for various Holy Days (Christmas, Hanukkah, Ramadan, etc.) including Halloween; so I don't really agree with this premise. Also Doctor Who is kinda already known for Sci-Fi/Horror thanks to the Early Cybermen Serials (of Season 4-6) &amp; Season 13-15 of Classic Who under Philip Hinchcliffe &amp; Robert Holmes (I'm including Holmes time as Script Editor for Season 15 despite Hinchcliffe leaving after Season 14). Therefore having a ""Halloween Special"" may come off as redundant.

I think New Years Day is a nice neutral holiday everyone can agree on the ""Meaning"" of (pointlessly pulling an all nighter getting hammered and ""celebrating"" the arbitrary event of starting a new calendar year - which honestly makes sense as a broadcast date for a TV Series about Time Travel).

Sidebar: The 1996 Eighth Doctor TV Movie was mostly set on New Years Eve 1999 so in the grand scheme of things this is nothing new (Doctor Who also aired an Episode on 1 Jan 1966 that briefly celebrated New Years Day before returning to the main narrative of ""The Daleks' Masterplan"" - so there is precedent for Dr Who &amp; the Daleks on BBC One's New Years Day TV Schedule).",True,False,False,,,,0,1606928809,,False,0,{},gedzwrh,False,t3_k58jvh,False,False,t3_k58jvh,/r/gallifrey/comments/k58jvh/instead_of_new_years_day_future_doctor_who/gedzwrh/,False,,1618140755,3,True,False,gallifrey,t5_2tf29,r/gallifrey,public,,0,[],

Sim, sim. Isso é verdade. O chinês simplificado é usado como língua franca na China e Taiwan, mas o chinês oficial de Taiwan é o chinês tradicional. Lembre-se que a reforma que gerou o chinês simplificado foi feita pelo Mao Zedong, e a separação política entre Taiwan e China fez com que essa ""barreira linguística"" fosse gerada.

&gt; Taiwanese Mandarin uses traditional Chinese characters like in the two Special administrative regions of China, Hong Kong and Macau, rather than the simplified Chinese characters used in mainland China.

&gt; A diferença entre tradicional e simplificado aparece na escrita (个 x 個, por exemplo) e mesmo assim os dois tipos de escrita tem bastantes caracteres iguais.

Sim, existem Hanzi que são iguais e alguns que são muito similares, mas isso é mais uma exceção do que a regra. E foi justamente por isso que eu disse que são línguas diferentes, porque as semelhanças você só vai notar depois de estudar por um bocado.

Alguns exemplos onde simplificado lembra o tradicional seria  會 --&gt; 会. Da pra notar uma clara semelhança entre os dois, mas a verdade é que a maioria dos Hanzi que você mais comumente usa vão ser muito diferentes.

&gt; Mas na fala a língua é a mesma.

B) colonial armies are often stuck in, well, the colonies, where they will be too busy putting down colonial revolts to help the mother nation’s armies in the Old World

C) you can’t control how your colonies build their armies, so there’s a good chance they’ll end up having a stack with 12 infantry, 7 cavalry and 2 cannons in the 1680’s because the AI sucks at building good armies

D) colonies usually don’t have a lot of transport ships, and that combined with the fact that there’s an entire ocean separating the colony and the actual war means that it will take forever for a colonial army to get to the battlefield even if they aren’t stuck suppressing revolts in the New World

E) sometimes colonies just get stuck on lower tech levels due to the extreme amount of land they have to conquer, core and control in a short time span, and so you’ll have a tech level 11 New Spain when actual Spain is like 16-17

&gt;  
&gt;In 2012 YouGov conducted a study called [‘Democracy on trial’](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2012/06/18/democracy-trial) which measured and analysed attitudes to British democracy and the political system. It revealed massive discontent about the operation of the country’s democratic institutions.  
&gt;  
&gt;Since then topics such as the global debt crisis, tensions over the future of the European Union, political divides in the US, [the populism debate](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/05/03/which-conspiracy-theories-do-populists-believe), as well as the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, have further deepened challenges for democracy and its role both in Britain and globally. Issues such as Brexit and the future of the United Kingdom, with fresh calls for devolution, have also played a role.  
&gt;  
&gt;To investigate the effects of this YouGov has conducted a wide-ranging study on democracy and its perception in the United Kingdom as part of its Big Surveys project. The goal of the YouGov Democracy Study is to measure and analyse the attitudes and opinions of the British public about democracy in general.  
&gt;  
&gt;In this study we did not provide a definition of ‘democracy’, given that the term and concept have a broad meaning and are often mentioned and discussed in public. Providing our own definition would have increased the risk of influencing the results.  
&gt;  
&gt;The results do not paint a rosy picture of British democracy. While there is overall strong support for democracy as a concept, the British public would like to see considerable changes to their own system. Many complained that they either don’t have enough of a say, or none at all, in how our country is run. Whilst there is strong support for making important decisions through referenda, the public is split on how the 2016 EU referendum affected democracy in the UK.  
&gt;  
&gt;When it comes to the rest of the world, more Britons think that the planet is becoming less democratic and feel that coronavirus will harm the spread of democracy.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The study has been divided into six parts:**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Part 1: Democracy as a concept (to be published 3 Dec)**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Part 2: Democracy in the UK (to be published 4 Dec)**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Part 3: Democracy and British parliamentarianism (to be published 7 Dec)**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Part 4: Democracy and the elections (to be published 8 Dec)**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Part 5: Democracy and referendums (to be published 9 Dec)**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Part 6: Democracy in the world (to be published 10 Dec)**  
&gt;

I don't think you're right, but let's say you are.

There has never been a time in the history of the US where the country was the dominant economic force, the dominant military force, and was also isolationist and routinely broke treaties with allies.  

America's dirty little secret is, you *can't* ensure your place as the dominant economic and military power without engaging deeply with other countries.

For example, the strategic goal of the Trans-Pacific Partnership was to ensure the US was the primary trade partner with several pacific nations rather than China.  It was a move to slow down China's economic growth.  When Trump pulled out, China stepped in and benefited from all that trade.  

Another: America is the number one arms dealer in the world partly to stop Russia from being the number one arms dealer in the world.  Who benefits?  Why, American weapons manufacturers, obviously.  But also America--countries that depend on America for their arms are less likely to join Russia and/or China should they go to war with the US. 

The less engaged America is, the more engaged Russia and China are, and the stronger they become both economically and militarily, at America's expense.

In many respects the playoff and committee are bad for college football. What makes CFB great is that it is historically a regional sport. You have the relatively local and long standing rivalries. Those rivalries are the best part of college football. The NFL's rivalries can't even compare. Whats happening though is, as someone else said, the NFL-ization of CFB. There are only 32 teams in the NFL and 12 playoff spots so its ok to just focus on that. You can't do that with 120+ plus FBS teams and 4 playoff spots. Everything is getting ignored for the top few programs and the playoffs to the detriment of everything else. It is making the season a formality and sapping the fun out of CFB. 

This is happening, imo because of the power of national TV money. Money discrepancy has always been there but it seems like a bigger deal now and really stratifies the haves and have nots. I also think it hurts the conferences and regional rivalries. TV networks are trying to cater to national audiences and that means downplaying rivalries that ""don't grab the eyeballs"" so to speak. 

All of this is comparable in some ways to European soccer. A lot of the fans both irl and online feel like important characteristics of the game are being lost because of money. Money has always been powerful in the sport but with massive tv contracts it has only exacerbated the issues. Unless your team is a top 5 team in your league at best then it is going to get ignored. You won't be on tv as much and people won't talk about you. The league season is treated as a formality at least when it comes to big teams vs small teams. Now everyone's eyes are on the Champions League so some European clubs are talking about making their own super league which would basically ruin the sport. 

What makes soccer great isn't Juventus vs Bayern Munich or Real Madrid 3-5 times every single season for multiple years in a row. What makes it great is those teams squaring off in a very important game once every few years. What makes it great is those local regional rivalries. Same thing for CFB. It would have been cool to say Oregon and Alabama play in like 2012. Clemson vs Bama in 2015 and 2016 were great. But that matchup isn't what makes the sport great, especially if it happens every single year. What makes the sport great is the regular season upsets and close calls and rivalry games that determine if that matchup happens.

The FA cup in England used to be one of the greatest sporting competitions. Every single team in English soccer would compete against one another, from the giants like Liverpool and Manchester United to the 6th tier semipro teams who would chain smoke and drink six packs at halftime. There was something known as the ""magic of the cup"" where one of the giants would have to visit a lower division side and they'd get knocked out, or a lower division side would make a dramatic run deep in the competition. It was a huge deal to win the FA cup, even a bigger deal than winning the first division. That changed with TV money (which led to the creation of the Premier League). Now the FA cup is an afterthought and Premier League giants trot out back-ups and youngsters.

I won't. You are not only correct, but you have (perhaps unwittingly) put your finger on the cause of the major political conflict of our time. 

""MAGA"" vs ""Orange Man Bad"" is really ""anti trade with China"" vs ""pro trade with China"". 

Now, that might just not be immediately obvious, so let's walk through the how and why. 

Throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the US was to some degree a free market economy. This generated a lot of wealth, as free markets tend to do. But during the twentieth century, partially at the behest of the left, partially through consensus, the US started on enact a lot of labour regulation and environmental protection laws. Libertarian-capitalist types tended to see these as having a damping effect on the economy, but others either disagreed or saw this as a price they were willing to pay. 

Who was correct about this is not really important to this story. 

The point is, China didn't enter into this equation at first, because during this time it was a straight up authleft communist hell, which was too busy exterminating its population to be able to do much of anything else. 

However, around this time, the Russians finally realized communism doesn't work, and gave up on it. And the Chinese, while they may be far too cooperative for their own good, are certainly not stupid. The CCP realized that, while they couldn't do a public 180, they needed to permit more economic activity to prevent their autocracy from collapsing. 

So they loosened the values somewhat, and China gradually started to have an industrial revolution. 

Well, remember what the industrial revolution was like in the West? It was horrible. Awful working conditions. Pollution so bad that people who could afford to had to ""go to the seaside to take the air"", while people who couldn't just coughed up their lungs and slowly died. The only silver lining, from a historical perspective, was that this would make things way better for their grandchildren. 

However significant the West is in effect, however... it's relatively small in terms of how much of the global population it represents. So Britain and America may have choked their own population, but they didn't warm up the planet all that much. 

China is different. China is big. China can make enough smoke to fuck us all. 

So, how did the rest of the world, and America in particular, react to China having an industrial revolution? 

Well, to understand this, you have to understand that politics is not about principles, but interests. Political parties do not serve nations, and they do not serve demographics. They serve people who keep them in power. 

This has to be understood in order to realize why the American left quickly undertook the agenda of exporting American heavy industry to China (and the third world) as fast as possible, thereby working to circumvent all the worker and environmental protections it spent the last hundred years fighting for. 

The same principle explains why the American right began to fight to keep industry in the place where there were all these regulations they had spent the last hundred years fighting against. 

Because the people who provide the American left with its path to power are Wall Street, Silicon Valley, and Hollywood. Not the *voters*, understand, but the actual power brokers. And what do they want? Simple to answer... look at what they sell. Financial instruments, software, and entertainment. All things that can be exported to a global market with no impediments whatsoever. So the fortunes of these entities are not tied to US national prosperity in any significant way. 

This is why the Clintons spearheaded free trade agreements like NAFTA. And why Ross Perot said that if they passed, we would hear a ""giant sucking sound"" as all our jobs and industry got exported. And it's why we did indeed hear that sucking sound almost immediately back then, and why we are still hearing it thirty years later. 

So, who is the right, what do they want, and what did they do? 

Well, the neoconservatives, exemplified by the Bush family, McCain, Romney, et al, were just fine with that giant sucking sound. Their power brokers were mostly the military industrial complex and the prison industrial complex, which were doing fine so long as we were bombing third world countries, and locking people up for possessing plants. 

But the thing was, their *voters* weren't fine. Because they were middle America, small business owners, and the white working class... precisely the people who were having their livelihoods sucked away. But for a long time, they had no one to vote for, because the choices were Barrack ""Your Job is Not Coming Back"" Obama, or McCain and Romney. 

Then along came Donald Trump. 

*Donald Trump is not a republican*. He has skinned the republican party and is wearing it as a hat. 

The big upset in recent American politics was not the general election of Donald Trump, it was the *primary* election of Donald Trump... because this was a coup within the republican party, staged by the voters against the leaders. 

This is why there was a lot of ""never Trump"" resistance at first, and why it was crushed to the point where all former republican leaders have either bent the knee to Trump (Cruz, McConnell), or been exiled to the wilderness (Romney, Ryan). 

And why did Donald Trump crush the resistance so easily? 

Because he's not a politician, and he didn't operate like one. He's a businessman. And businessmen become successful by knowing what the customer wants, and build brand recognition... two things that Trump excels at. 

Donald Trump saw that republican leaders had lost awareness (or didn't care) what their customers (voters) wanted. He said to himself ""I don't have to go through party politics to run for president. I can steal all their customers and make them irrelevant.""

And so he did. 

But what was it that republican voters wanted? They wanted two, and only two, things (the rest being just window dressing). 

* They wanted to stop the export of American heavy industry to China and the third world. 
* They wanted to stop the importation of cheap exploitable foreign labour. 

In other words, **they wanted Ross Perot's ""sucking sound"" to stop**. They didn't have the luxury of caring that Donald Trump is eccentric, and vulgar, and acts unpredictably. They hadn't had a candidate who represented them since Reagan, and now they did. 

So they elected him. Which pitched the American left into a fit of anxiety. Not about any personal traits of Donald Trump, as they claim. But because **his agenda directly impacts the bottom line of their power players**.  

Example: Jeff Bezos became one of the richest men in the world by exporting American heavy industry to China. Jeff owns the Washington Post. So what do you suppose the Washington Post has to say about the man who was elected for the sole purpose of waging a trade war with China? 

Is this all starting to make sense now? ""Trump Derangement Syndrome"" and ""Orange Man Bad"" aren't insane and hysterical at all. They are entirely rational attempts to defend the gravy train. 

So what does this all have to do with global warming? 

Well, it explains why the left, while calling global warming an existential threat to humanity, is actually working to accelerate it, while the right, which calls it a myth, is actually working to retard it. 

Neither side actually cares, but more environmental regulation here in America will speed the export of American industry to China, which the left wants and the right doesn't. 

In fact, this whole situation can be understood by looking at the fall of Rome. One of the major factors in the decline of the Roman economy was the replacement of the free labouring classes by slaves taken in wars in Europe, and fed with Egyptian grain. 

This was good for the wealthy, who owned those slaves, but the plebes found it increasingly difficult to earn a living. So in order to pacify the mob... free bread and circuses, instead of jobs. This gradually demolishes the economy, but it makes a lot of people rich in the meantime. 

In a non-literal, but very real, sense... *Donald Trump is Julius Caesar*. He is a member of the upper class, but gains his support from the common by serving their financial interests, who support him despite his autocratic tendencies *because* he serves those interests. The upper class is desperate to stop him, and if they can't do it with shady election hijinks, they will stab him instead... which will give the nation over to a series of competing power brokers following who imitate his hegemony, but not his policies. 

And in a very real sense, the DNC is Cassius, Brutus, and the Senate. They want to stop Caesar for personal financial motivations, but they claim to be doing so in the interests of democracy and the republic. They want to expand the slave trade, and keep the free plebes pacified with government handouts. 

And the interesting thing about these stories is that they are real history, not fictional morality plays. Neither Caesar, nor Trump, nor the CCP, nor the DNC, is a made-up character designed to be a villain, but are real people with interests to serve. 

Caesar was an autocrat who want against the rule of law, but he wasn't the first to do so, and the plebes didn't have the luxury of caring about that, because he was critical to their survival. The patricians despised him as vulgar, didn't understand why the plebes loved him, and eventually subverted the political process to cast him out of power.
