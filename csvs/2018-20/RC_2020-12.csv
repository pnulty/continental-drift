Por isso é sempre muito comum cair na armadilha do isolamento já que aparentemente não tem ninguém que te entenderia. 

Talvez seja só essa semana que você esteja pensando assim, se for, nem leia o resto, mas senão, continue.

O que eu gostaria de dizer, vindo de uma pessoa que lida com depressão e ansiedade, é que provavelmente você se encontra num ""espaço mental"" negativo com muita frequência. Com isso é muito comum ter esses pensamentos de que é impossível ser feliz. A realidade objetiva dos fatos é que é possível, salvo casos muito complicados. O que eu quero dizer, é que é possível que você consiga tirar a cabeça pra fora desse espaço mental negativo e passar a vislumbrar possibilidades.

É fácil, mas é difícil começar a correr atrás de por a cabeça pra fora desse poço. Primeiramente, você tem que se exercitar todos os dias, dormir e acordar em horários constantes e se alimentar bem. Como eu disse, é simples, mas exige trabalho. Faça consistentemente. Procure entrar em contato com a natureza com frequência.

Depois tem a parte que já citaram aqui. Você poderia se beneficiar de terapia. Acredito fortemente nisso. Sei que não está na realidade financeira de todos, e se for o caso pra você procure serviços gratuítos. 

Eu não sou um homem de fé, mas se você for, dê atenção a ela. Pratique gratidão. Existem estudos que mostram o quanto a prática de dizer a si mesmo, ou então a sua entidade de escolha, o quanto é grado por x, y e z, pode ter benefícios à saúde mental. Eu por exemplo, sou grato demais por não ter de pegar ônibus pra ir pros lugares, pois tenho bicicleta e moto. É bobeira, mas se eu tivesse que pegar ônibus eu ia ter meu humor destruído. 

Essas pessoas que te humilharam em um certo momento da vida eram pessoas infelizes. Não se faz isso com alguém sem que haja algo de triste dentro de si. É difícil perdoar, mas quando você entende que essa gente só estava procurando alguém que eles consideraram digno de colocar pra baixo no momento, fizeram porque existe uma insatisfação muito grande dentro deles é mais fácil deixar pra lá. 

Fazer amizade não é fácil, cara. Tem gente que diz ter se beneficiado te um certo livro de autoajuda intitulado ""como fazer amigos e influenciar pessoas"". Nunca li, acho o título brega.

No que diz respeito à idade. Você ainda é muito novo. Muita gente passa a viver plenamente nessa idade, pois finalmente conseguiram sair das garras de pais narcisistas e/ou escrotos.

Lembrando do fato de você ter relatado que achava que não merecia ser feliz como os outros por ter ido mal em certas disciplinas na faculdade, uma coisa que eu tento me lembrar quando estou sendo mau comigo mesmo: é preciso que sejamos nossos melhores amigos. A gente não fala pra um amigo que ele deve ser infeliz por ter ido mal na faculdade, por que devemos falar isso pra nós mesmos?

The EU is functionally a trade agreement with open borders.  They just share a currency.  In what way am I incorrect?  It developed from the European Economic Community, which itself came out of the the BeNeLux Countries' trade agreement post war.  I mentioned reductionism because I don't think you understand the history of Europe and why those contentions exist.  For Europe, these things are really important.  Bosnia and Herzegovina desperately wants to join, but the Republoka Srpska is holding them back.  The Bosnian Genocide is a direct result of a power vacuum cause by the lack of a ""central governing authority"".  When Bosnia happened, it was such a big deal for a place that had a genocide 50 years earlier.  Did ""never again"" actually mean anything?

&gt; Yeah, I don't think you know that much about geopolitics. Pretty much Cypress and Greece have no influence in the EU, if the other more powerful countries wanted Turkey and Ukraine to enter they have any number of instruments from which to yield leverage.

They'll leverage them economically.  But there are other concerns as well.  Again, you seem to think trade deals and everything happen in a vacuum.  They don't.  There's a lot of preceding history that goes into it.  And you don't seem to get this.  Do you think that history just ends?  Why do you think Europe is the way it is?

&gt; But that's besides the point, there's no way that cheap labor is going to be a good thing for anyone but the rich ultimately. And possibly the upper middle class. For workers, it's a losing deal.

Researching anything is quite difficult because most content produced online is made with one purpose: to have you buy something, click on an affiliate link, etc. This leads to reviews being shallow and overly positive. I do not remember reading anything insightful about Hasselblads. What helps is going to ""classic"" film forums like https://www.photo.net/ or https://photrio.com/ and using their search feature to find all threads/topics with _""Hasselblad""_ in the title. That's real people asking each other questions and troubleshooting real world problems.

You will quickly learn that:

* 500-series is indeed a much better choice than 200 or 2000 series due to better reliability and ease of servicing (and availability of spare parts). 
* 501cm models provide the best value. They're a bit newer than 500c/m and theoretically have a bit more life left in them, but they aren't as expensive as 503cw.
* Avoid C-lenses as they are too old to be serviced due to lack of parts. CFE or CFI lenses are too new/expensive, but CF are the best value.
* It is true: Hasselblad gear needs to be wound all the time, even when stored.
* When buying a body, make sure it has the Accumate-D (2nd gen) focusing screen inside, that's $400+ value if purchased separately. The part numbers are 42204 (crosshairs), 42215 (split+microprism) and 42217 (split+grid). People sell newer cameras with older screens (1st gen Accumate, or pre-Accumate) on eBay.
* Film backs are the weakest part of the system.
* Most owners will agree that a Hasselblad body + back needs a regular CLA every 2-3 years, and benefits from regular exercise.

I have gotten into this system just a few months ago and absolutely love it. About the gliding mirror (GLS) feature: my longest lens is a 150mm CF, and I see no difference in vignetting on a GLS and a non-GLS body, so I'm not sure about BravoJuliet69's comment regarding ""longer than 80mm"", maybe it meant to be ""180mm""?

I haven't erally caught up with the media through books yet but have recently started catching up on on Clone Wars and a bit on Rebels, I've only played KOTOR and the mmo, the movies of course, and The Mandalorian. I think Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni might be helping to reset the sequels with The Mandalorian and try to follow EU/Legends more with Rey being the younger sister of Ben Solo (Kylo Ren), her memories were wiped and she was also one of the students at the Jedi Temple but her memories were wiped for a reason, along with the others, Finn, and her brother, Ben Solo, one of the reason is to hide her past, Luke, her mom Leia, or someone wiping her memories and then send Rey to Jakku, but Ben and a few others were taken, most students were killed or being sold to the First Order, but Ben was taken by Snoke or some of the other higher dark side force-users because they've seen how powerful Ben Solo can become and what he's able to do for the Dark side and seduced/brain-washed him and made him join the dark side. I think one of the reasons why he joined because he felt bullied by others or for some other reason. Finn wasn't strong enough with the force so they ended up wiping his memories and making him join in as a stormtrooper for the post Galactic empire, First Order. The ship that was shown in Episode 7 sin Rey's past (looking like the Millenial Falcon) to drop her off at Jakku was for a reason. Same thing with Finn, people know he's a force-sensitive storm trooper who had a similar fate as Rey and ended up having a lot of his memories wiped and being sent to grow up later on as a First Order stormtrooper and then he has an awakening like Rey and Ben. 

Luke was scared about Kylo Ren's future and didn't see any goodness in him and attempted to kill him at his Jedi Temple because he saw that he would be tempted by Snoke? Episode 8 didn't explain why Ben would go to the dark side.  Luke was afraid of him going into the dark side. But  Ben Solo powerful enough to convince some of his students to join the Dark Side? Has Luke forgotten what he did to his father, Darth Vader, who was the most powerful Sith in the galaxy? Luke has never represented any of that, he's always represented hope and the one to rush off to help his friends. He also believed there was good in even in his father, Darth Vader (Anakin Skywalker), but not to his teenage nephew? Luke being racked with guilt that he didn’t do more to help Ben is far more plausible, or searching for something needed to stop Snoke.  Luke would never actually have the instinct to kill his own nephew because he saw his future, that in and of itself completely changed the entire direction and narrative as why Ben solo got seduced by Snoke in the first place giving his dark side name, Kylo Ren. The writing for that part in Episode 8 by Rian Johnson didn't make any sense. 

There is a theory I wanted to see Rey to fit in from some of the theories I've been seeing, and that is seeing Rey as a Solo, and she's one of the padawan students of Luke in the past, except her memories got wiped and is trying to regain it, and I think that’s why the name of Episode 7, ""The Force Awakens"", Rey discovers her power from the past and is slowly regaining it as time goes by (similar to Revan in Kotor ). I know how a lot of the lore through the games and some books I've skimmed through in Legends, and besides non-canon and legends fan fiction in Star Wars where I've read many force-users discovering their powers through time because they had their memory wiped from the past, like some in the past as a student and eventually discovers their memories as they train back. This theory would have worked out in the sequels. And there's no reason to see why Kylo Ren would say something absurd like that to her in EP 8 that she's a nobody and her parents were nobodies and junk dealers that tried to trade/smuggle her for drinking/gambling money. Then the course of episode 9 was significantly changed and in Rey's backstory  when Abrams decided to go with the fan theory of her being a descendant of Palpatine. Are you kidding me?

I think it's rather a silly method. I think Kylo Ren is just lying to her about her past, which is  similar to the quotes in the movie and the trailers we heard him say, “Let the past die, kill it if you must. It's the only way to become what you were meant to be” which makes sense, he really wants to forget the past that he destroyed of himself. And he even said that he knows her [https://youtu.be/db9NsZJjcNs?t=9](https://youtu.be/db9NsZJjcNs?t=9) he even said she’s some ancient Jedi master or something, but this is coming from BF2 so I don’t think it really matters since it’s not canon apparently. They were trying to come up with something here and I guess the directors or people in charge of the writing didn't catch up with this.

So if Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni are trying to reset the sequel series to making it into-non canon, the Mandalorian is just one step in the right direction, hopefully trying to remake the sequels even though Carrie Fischer passed away, we can get a CG actress for her. I still think the death of Han Solo, Luke, and even Leia could've been done a lot better so it wouldn't be like what we've seen in the sequel.

Ish.  Simultaneously, they have regulators regulating against other regulators.

Now, citizenship alone does not solve anything, given the current state of Turkey, the government must guarantee equal rights, language rights, religious neutrality, etc. The genocide should be included in the educational curriculum (teach the good and bad of our shared history, understanding the role that both cristian and muslim, convert, Armenians and others played in the Empire), the heritage must be taken care of, this means monuments, churches, monasteries, and so that are current in bad state or were improperly repurposed must be dedicated as museums at least. Maybe also adopting a more neutral, less islamic flag?

Also, it could be implemented some kind of tax advantages, like the US and Canada do with their native population. Turkey will also benefit of attracting Armenians to their land (decreasing Kurdish nationalism for example).

I’m the HOH of a new FH called A Sprinkle of Style. Currently we have 8 members so obviously we need more!

We’re a fun friendly house, willing to chat and give advice, who want to win prizes. We plan to rally fancy most of the time, with a couple of fierce rallies each month to secure the four grand bags!

Rules:

1. House members must play half the rallies each month - so it’s possible to toggle on for 5, and toggle off for 5

2. If toggled on and participating in a rally, daily challenges and $100 challenges are required

$200 challenges and FBs are not required but a willingness to play them sometimes (eg during fierce rallies) would be great ☺️ 

If you miss a required challenge please just let us know. We know that life gets in the way sometimes, so if you’re ill or have a family emergency etc we’ll understand. I fell asleep before submitting a challenge lately - luckily it wasn’t a rally challenge! But we understand that accidents happen and don’t hold it against anyone unless it happens consistently.

If you accidentally miss a req challenge during a fierce rally, you’ll probably be removed temporarily, but you can request to rejoin the house. This is simply because fierce rallies have higher targets so are harder to reach and we’re unlikely to do so unless everyone enters. 

And if you continually miss entering required challenges while toggled on, then you run the risk of removal from the house. We don’t want to be too harsh but it’s unfair on everyone else in the house if somebody continually breaks the rules. 

It's a private house and our filters are English, and European.

You have to take the precautions. Theres a reasom shooting sports are one of the safest sports even in school clubs.

You cant drive drunk without a seatbelt without consequences. If your not mature enough to drive safely you should not drive.

Anyone stupid enough to leave a loaded firearm in the open is a self solving problem.

There are safety rules for firearms.

Always assume every gun is loaded. Keep pointed in a safe direction. Don't point at anything you dont intend to shoot. 

Etc etc

Ive been handling guns since i was 5. There are kids that shot their first deer before they turned 10.

You have to take the precautions. It is your choice. If you feel you are not mature enough to own firearms then do not buy one.

3 million crimes are stopped by firearms every year according to the CDC. 

Thats a pretty good benefit.

Out of all gun crime. About 4k murders happen. About 30kish die a year by guns. Most of them suicide.

That is part of risk. Everything you do has risk.

You drive you can die even if your the best goddamn driver on earth. All the mechanical safety features in modern cars. You can still die. Or be severely injured.
Because of a drunk driver. Who kills more a year than firearms.

If mom let little timmy handle a loaded firearm outside a gun range. That's her fault. Yes. It is her fault.

Theres an old video on YouTube of someone allowing a kid handle an full auto Uzi at the range. A machine gun rental. For some reason they allowed the kid to handle it. Rather than thinking logically. The kid couldn't handle the recoil and it blew the head off the guy assisting her.

You cant give someone the keys to a car without training. You negate most risk with training. Machine guns arent legal for most us citizens to own unfortunately. Pre 86 is the only choice and they are expensive. 

Ofc 3d printing has allowed groups who could formerly not own firearms do so. Even a European owning a semi auto FGL 9mm carbine. Made his own ammo. All that

Guns have a purpose. Fun is one. Defense is another and hunting. For some like me. We also like collecting. Firearms are apart of our history and culture. To tell us to get rid of them is like walking into a mosque and telling folks to stop wearing hijab. 

You may not understand and i don't expect you to. But this is the way.

And with our goverment going the way it is. Why would i not want to be armed?

I believe that psychosis is more likely when you smoke concentrates because it tends to have less CBD. I believe CBD prevents THC psychosis. this is why synthetic cannabinoids are so bad and often lead to psychotic states, since they usually have no cbd in it.

THC = partial receptor agonist, usually with at least some CBD in its mixture. 

Synthetic cannabinoids= full agonist, with no CBD combined. 

The link between THC and CBD is important. Smoking concentrates is slowly becoming more common in america, and I think soon it'll be more easier to link psychosis to thc.

Secondly, Check Netherlands data.

Holownia its the only one that **really** stays in the center

PiS its like GA14 candidate

KO.. has their problems (portrayed as if they were AOC)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

There are still complaints that the opposition is doing nothing, but that is not the problem. The opposition is doing a painstaking job in parliament, but there is no leader who could tell Poles about it. The expressive Marta Lempart and Szymon Hołownia draw more attention than the leaders of the parliamentary opposition. How are they going to win against PiS?

&amp;#x200B;

The United Right is going through the worst crisis since 2015. The politicians of the ruling coalition are not coping with the pandemic, are unable to get along with each other, and have opened two dangerous fronts: on abortion and the EU budget. Both go beyond the traditional divisions between Poland and the PO-PiS, mobilizing the wider electorate against the rulers. Despite the pandemic, thousands of Polish women dissatisfied with the ruling of the Tribunal by Julia Przyłębska take to the streets, and in a moment they may be joined by citizens who are concerned that PiS wants to move Poland out of the EU . Even the overwhelming majority of the PiS electorate is against the polexit. Zbigniew Ziobro is heating up the dispute over the new EU budgethoping that this would attract the most radical right-wing choices to his Solidarity Poland. Jarosław Kaczyński, who was once considered a genius strategist, cannot tame Ziobro.

&amp;#x200B;

It would seem that the crisis of the ruling team should benefit the largest opposition group, a natural contender to take power. However, subsequent polls show that support for PiS is falling, but the bars of the Civic Coalition are not growing. It's even worse - support for KO has slightly decreased since the 2019 elections. In the latest Ipsos survey for [OKO.press](https://OKO.press), in which PiS recorded only 29 percent, Koalicja Obywatelska - 23 percent. This is four percentage points less than KO received in the last parliamentary elections (27.4 percent). The Left, which in the Ipsos poll showed support at the level of 10 percent, is not gaining either, which means that its slogans about liberalizing the anti-abortion law do not arouse great enthusiasm. The Confederation (9%) and PSL-Kukiz'15 (4%) are not growing either.

&amp;#x200B;

Szymon Hołownia's Poland 2050 is the only grouping whose support is growing on the opposition side. And this despite the fact that the party has no club or circle in the Seym. He has only one MP, Hanna Gill-Piątek, who escaped from the Lewica club. However, if the elections were held today, Poland by 2050 could count - according to Ipsos - on as much as 20 percent of support (an increase by 10 percentage points). This is only 3 percentage points less than KO!

&amp;#x200B;

This result shows that Poles are tired of the parliamentary opposition and want something new. This is bad news for KO, because PiS alone is unlikely to win. And it is not because he is doing nothing or screaming in a loud voice that PiS is destroying and stealing Poland, as the voters on the liberal-democratic side are used to complaining. The opposition does painstaking work on a daily basis. If it were not for KO MPs Michał Szczerba and Dariusz Joński, the public would not have learned about the scams when buying protective equipment needed to fight the coronavirus pandemic. On the occasion of covid bills, the opposition tabled many important amendments, not counting other bills that PiS ritually rejects.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem, however, is that the opposition still does not have its own story about Poland or a leader who would be able to reach the emotions of Poles. I regret that, but elections are still being won by emotions, and perhaps even more so, given the populist march in Europe that will hopefully stop Joe Biden's win in the US.

&amp;#x200B;

There is no such leader who would be able to speak to the hearts of Poles, neither in the KO, nor in the Left, nor in the Confederation or the PSL. It did not turn out to be the new PO chairman, Borys Budka, who is a great lawyer and hard-working politician, but he does not captivate the crowds. Włodzimierz Czarzasty, Robert Biedroń and Adrian Zandberg, who was supposed to be the hope of the Left, but has disappeared somewhere, are not such leaders either. Today, the expressive Marta Lempart, the leader of the Polish Women's Strike, draws more attention than the leaders of the parliamentary opposition. Many are indignant at its harsh language, but since we have an exceptional situation in Poland - as the opposition has been arguing for five years - then the language must be adequate to the situation. Polls show that the opposition can win against PiS, but a wider coalition would have to be formed - e.g. KO,

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps voters see hope in Szymon Hołownia, although one poll is not enough to draw far-reaching conclusions. The advantage of Hołownia is freshness, he was not in charge yet, so he did not have to make difficult decisions that would burden him. Hołownia is a showman and a good speaker.

1. The verb *to be* - important to learn, especially in languages where it differs from English (*ser* means something different to *estar*, *shì* means something different to *zài*). Without learning these you will lose some of the meaning of the sentence - what, for example, is the difference between *Juan es listo* and *Juan está listo*? The verbs both translate to English as forms of *to be* but the meaning of the sentence is quite different. This is a basic thing.

2. Numerals. Many exchanges of information involve this: what is your phone number? How much does that shirt cost? And so on. The value of the numbers is absolutely vital for a successful exchange of this basic information, and thus forms part of the foundation.

3. Greetings and goodbyes. These are not obvious. For one thing, if a Dane says *hej* to you - which sounds like an English *hi* - there's a fairly good chance it's a farewell, especially if they say it twice in a row. Secondly, while a lot of European greetings might seem obvious, that's largely through either similarity or exposure imo. Most of us have probably heard *ni hao* before, but how many would recognise *zai jian*?

4. Basic colours are maybe 5-10 words, so not massively difficult to learn, and can be extremely helpful since people use colour to distinguish objects a lot.

5. Names of animals/plants/countries - ok, I agree with you on plants, but basic animals, especially those likely to be kept as pets or which have cultural significance, are definitely foundation words. As are the country/ies where the target language is spoken, the learner's home country, and a couple other major countries (the USA fits into this last category for me, for example).

OP, it's a very random question during a lockdown, but if you're going to mention Japan, why did you immediately volley the question to her again? There's no space to even ask a question here in return. If you wanted to talk about travel, that's totally fine, but you're going to have to do something more than giving your own one-word answers in response to the question you just asked. That's just poor conversation skills coming back to bite you.

In that example, I might mention that I miss traveling and that I wanted to go to Japan to visit my brother who is stationed out there, or because the last time I went to Japan I had an incredible time in Tokyo, or I want to go during the cherry blossom festival, or I've been learning Japanese in anticipation of going... Maybe I'll just talk about traveling in general, anything! Notice that it's not a question, it's a statement with enough detail to generate questions that she can now ask if she's interested. You have to give her something to respond to. 

""I want to go to Japan, where do you want to go?"" Is too pointed of a question, so not only have you not given her anything to discuss based on what you previously just brought up as the topic, but you are also now inviting her to change the (sub)topic from Japan to wherever she wants to travel (or worse: you get the dreaded ""me too!""). She's going to answer the question you gave her.. now you have to pull teeth to get more information. She wasn't prepared to talk about Europe, you're the one that brought up travel and it's not fair to assume she should be ready to entertain you in the topic of your choosing.

The reason why I bring this cultural difference up is that taxpayer-funded Medicare isn't just healthcare with price ceilings and a national registry of prices, it means that when you get sick, eat junk food, neglect your body etc, you aren't just your own burden, but you are the burden of an entire society.

You forgot about Stalin and that he was a mass murderer, didn't you?

Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union when Crimea was gifted to them. In 2014 however Crimea was part of Ukraine, an independent country. Putin tried to wheel his influence there by installing his puppet Victor Yanucovych (remember him, he is wanted for high treason in Ukraine) Yanucoych's rival Yushchenko was poisoned with dioxin in 2004 btw, remember. Ukraine had gradually started talks with the EU and NATO about becoming a member, something Putin really didn't want because the eastern Ukrainian border is just 400 km distance from Moscow and he didn't want to lose another ex SU country. 

Victor Yanucovych tried to change certain laws and constitutions to prevent Ukraine's western shift. Two US brokers, Paul Manaford, remember him, and Tad Devine (he was Bernie's campaign chairman in 2016 were lobbying for Victor Yanucovych. 

Both of Bernie's campaigns were boosted with dirty Russian oligarch money. He also voted against the Magnitsky act and several times against sanctions on Russia.

When Ukrainians got wind of the scheming they took to the streets during the Euromaidan protests and ousted Yanucovych who fled the country and to Moscow.

That's when Putin decided to march his troops into Crimean and Donbass and Obama started to sanction Russia.

In the Darth Plagueis novel, Sidious all but says all the plans for the Clone Wars were his that he fed to Plagueis to give back to him. How much of that you believe may vary, but Plagueis did seem to withdraw from the galaxy, so it does make sense. Plagueis had the general idea, but he would have lacked the ability to control the war without Palpatine as Chancellor. 

That could go one of two ways to me. The most likely path would be Plagueis just letting things play out without the final step of actually killing the Jedi. He would use the war to erode public confidence in the Jedi, but since he doesn’t have a direct role, he can’t capitalize on it. So the grand plan gets delayed for another Sith down the line. 

The other option is with Plagueis actively controlling the Separatists. He pretty clearly had influence with the beings who would become the Separatist Council. Plagueis could have tried to actively help the Separatist win and maybe lead them from the shadows. Though, again, without the inside information Palpatine would have had access to. I guess it would depend if he thought he could take over through force or not.

In February 2008, China and Russia together submitted a draft to the UN known as the Treaty on Prevention of the Placement of Weapons in Outer Space and of the Threat or Use of Force against Outer Space Objects (PPWT).[12][13] The US opposed the draft treaty due to security concerns over its space assets despite the treaty explicitly affirming a State's inherent right of self-defence.[14]

On December 4, 2014, the General Assembly of the UN passed two resolutions on preventing an arms race in outer space:[15]

The first resolution, Prevention of an arms race in outer space, ""call[s] on all States, in particular those with major space capabilities, to contribute actively to the peaceful use of outer space, prevent an arms race there, and refrain from actions contrary to that objective.""[15] There were 178 countries that voted in favour to none against, with 2 abstentions (Israel, United States).[15]
The second resolution, No first placement of weapons in outer space, emphasises the prevention of an arms race in space and states that ""other measures could contribute to ensuring that weapons were not placed in outer space.""[15] 126 countries voted in favour to 4 against (Georgia, Israel, Ukraine, United States), with 46 abstentions (EU member States abstained on the resolution).[15]
The Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space (PAROS) is a committee subsidiary to the Conference on Disarmament.

""In 391 CE, as part of his attempt to wipe out paganism, Emperor Theodosius I officially sanctioned the destruction of the Serapeum, or Temple of Serapis at Alexandria. The destruction of the Temple was carried out under Theophilus, Bishop of Alexandria, and afterwards a Christian church was built on the site. It has been hypothesised that the daughter library of the Museum, located close to the Temple, and the Royal Library were also razed to the ground at this time. However, whilst it is plausible that manuscripts from the Serapeum library may have been destroyed during this purge, there is no evidence that the Royal Library still existed at the end the 4th century. No ancient sources mention the destruction of any library at this time, though 18th century English historian Edward Gibbon mistakenly attributes it to bishop Theophilus.""

[],,Alexander_the_Drake,1456733389.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_vxey3,False,False,[],"For **Jo Nesbø** as far as recommended starting points goes:
  
- _Headhunters_, a standalone darkly comedic crime thriller, is pretty good and a nice place to start if you want some humour and don't want to commit to an entire series all at once. It's my personal favourite of his, in part due to also having an excellent film adaptation that was praised by the late Roger Ebert.

- for his Harry Hole police thriller series, if you want to read the books actually set in Norway, start with the 3rd novel, _The Redbreast_, which is the beginning of the Oslo Trilogy arc. The first two novels take place as solo adventures overseas and aren't very representative of the later tone and style and are missing his supporting cast. (Also IMHO the writing quality in them is noticeably inferior.) Another decent jumping-on point later in the series is _The Snowman_, 7th novel, which happens after a bunch of character arcs have been wrapped up, and start a new set. It's also got a film adaptation, but apparently not a good one.

- personally, I was underwhelmed by his Olav Johansen duology starting with _Blood on Snow_, but it's got a different, more casual and lower-key style than Harry Hole if you'd prefer that instead

- I didn't care at all for _The Son_, which was explicitly a crime Christ allegory, but YMMV if you think you might be interested in that kind of thing. Similarly, he's also got a _Macbeth_ retelling, and there's also a new standalone, _The Kingdom_, which is supposed to be in a different style from his other previous work.

For other Norwegian authors, I've also read and would recommend:

**Jørn Lier Horst**'s William Wisting police procedural series set in the coastal town of Larvik is quite good and has won the Riverton and Petrona Awards. They're low-key procedural realism (Horst was a police officer himself) and have a good variety of different and sometimes unusual cases.

Everything from the 6th book, _Dregs_ (inspired by the real life mystery of British Columbia's washed up feet), onwards (the rest remain untranslated) is available from some combination of Sandstone Press, Penguin UK, and Macmillan in the US. The Sandstone editions have a handy recap of previous major developments (no whodunnit spoilers), so if you like, you can safely start with the two award-winning books, which ISTR are _The Hunting Dogs_ and _The Caveman_.

**Thomas Enger**'s Henning Juul quintet, starring a crime reporter returning to work after a personal tragedy (Enger himself is a journalist), and seeking evidence against the suspected criminal culprits behind it as an overarching storyarc backgrounding the individual cases. These lean sensationalist thriller-ish and the plot developments can be kind of contrived, but they're also delightfully cynical about media absurdity and the 24-hour news cycle if you like that kind of thing. It's also a complete series with a definite end, if that's a bonus. Between them, Orenda, Faber &amp; Faber, and Simon &amp; Schuster have all the books in English translation.

Enger also has a standalone I haven't read, and the Blix &amp; Ramm collaboration series with Jørn Lier Horst (they're apparently IRL friends and have their characters guest cameo in each others' books) which teams up a cop with a blogger.

**Gard Sveen** is a more recent author, but has already gotten a bunch of prizes for his debut novel, _The Last Pilgrim_, which I quite liked. IMHO, he reads pretty Nesbø-ish, with a Harry Hole-like police detective. The first case is an interesting mix of crime in the past related to crime in the present, if you like that kind of dual discovery storyline. AmazonCrossing has been translating his work, but it looks like they're not getting past the 2nd novel, which kind of has a semi-cliffhanger for some of the loose threads, just so you're warned.

I've also read a couple of works by Kjell Ola Dahl and Anne Holt which seemed fairly well done, but IMHO, haven't tried enough of their stuff to evaluate and recommend them overall. But they've both got pretty good reputations and Holt has the nickname “Queen of Norwegian Crime”.

If you'd like to try Norway-set mystery/thrillers written by foreigners, I've read and liked:

- **Robert Barnard**'s _Death in a Cold Climate_ (a standalone with a local policeman investigating the death of a foreigner in Tromsø) and _The Cherry Blossom Corpse_ (a series Scotland Yard detective on vacation with his sister at a romance novelist's conference which turns murderous), which were fairly good, in a kind of sober British procedural and mildly comedic cozy mystery style, respectively. Barnard has a Diamond Dagger Award for lifetime achievement from one of the crime writer's associations.

- **Katherine Hall Page**'s _The Body in the Fjord_, part of Faith Fairchild cozy mystery series starring a caterer and pastor's wife. This is a working vacation case with a supporting character investigating an old family friend's relative's death, and ISTR incorporated a nice use of Norwegian history. TBH, the rest of her series kind of grates on me because she recycles a certain core whodunnit motivation so much whether or not it really fits, but this is a pretty good installment to read standalone.

- **James R. Benn**'s _Billy Boyle_, 1st in an eponymous WWII-set mystery/crime/espionage thriller series, starring a young Boston cop who's a staffer for General Eisenhower, and taking care of cases all across the European theatre. This one involves Norwegian concerns and some of it takes place in Norway, as there are suspicions of a spy amongst the Norwegian government in exile as an invasion upon a strategic part of the country is planned. These are really quite good, and were one of my favourite series, though I haven't kept up with the later volumes.

For the other Nordic countries, I'll recommend the following anthologies as having a good sampler selection of short stories by local authors whose longer works you might want to look for:

However, I'm going to play devil's advocate for a moment.

1) There hadn't been a Blight in 400 years and it doesn't seem like records were exactly well-kept in terms of what a Blight entails. Especially since the Wardens are especially secretive of what their deal is, and also because Fereldan had changed hands a few times in the last few decades.

2) The Wardens could be seen as helping Orlesians get a foothold back in Fereldan, because they supported letting in Orlesian troops as well as the Orlesian Wardens. (FWIW though Duncan ALSO supported letting the Redcliffe troops come to support them at Ostagar, and it was Cailan who shut that down. However, Cailan was probably making his tactical decisions based on what Loghain told him. So.... well, I digress.)

I can actually follow Loghain's logic and I don't actually think it was THAT ridiculous. Putting it in modern terms, if someone told me that 400 years ago that the bubonic plague ravaged Europe and the only solution back then was basically to drink a lot of booze and hope for the best so that's exactly what we should do with COVID-19, I would say, ""Well, dude, it's 2020 and we have modern medicine, so why don't we socially distance, wear masks and wait for a vaccine?"" 

And then if I was a person in power who had reason to believe a foreign power would take advantage of this to destabilize my country, then I might make some sacrifices to maneuver myself into a better position to later face them.

So I don't actually think it was ever about whether Duncan actually believed there was a Blight or not. Most people have no clue why Wardens are needed at all other than that they fight darkspawn regularly. 

It's not unreasonable for Loghain to believe that they could defeat a darkspawn horde or an Archdemon with contemporary technology/magic. The horde wasn't the enemy to him. The enemy was Cailan and Orlais. The Wardens were just a tool being used by Orlais, so he had no issue framing them as the culprits. Meanwhile he had all his little pawns in play, with Howe killing off the Couslands, Jowan poisoning Eamon and Uldred setting off a revolution at the Circle, getting all his ducks lined up in a row. 

Like, if the Archdemon wasn't actually a big deal and it wasn't actually a Blight, he would have had a pretty good plan. Or if you didn't ACTUALLY need Wardens to kill the Archdemon, he might still have had it under control if he'd started prioritizing the darkspawn earlier. Too bad for everyone he was wrong.",True,False,False,,,,0,1606807952,,False,0,{},ge8mrqq,False,t3_k447ss,False,False,t1_ge86jqj,/r/dragonage/comments/k447ss/spoilers_all_loghain/ge8mrqq/,False,,1618049951,8,True,False,dragonage,t5_2r8lo,r/dragonage,public,,0,[],

Or your fault. Or my fault. Always someone else.

We always know better than someone else, we always know what is going behind the curtains (z3ama) and what the real intentions are (z3aaaaaama).

TOZ
-French has held us back but french has also advanced us
-French is a useful language but not in all situations.
-Z3ama you want to be modern and learn English while in many other countries people are looking at Chinese as the language of the future
-There are Moroccans all over the world, you cannot find 1 teacher who can learn you another language in your own time? No duolingo too?
-There are consequences for almost everything if such a change would take place, Morocco 2020 is not comparable to Devleti Aliye in 1920 nor Turkey in 1928.
-You think there is no bullshit like our bullshit abroad? It's everywhere and some things are worse.
-Too much to reply

No one shits over his own country and his own people like Mgharba. 
Either it's for Amazigh culture or status, or it's against the king, or about ""democracy"",  or about religion, about work, about corruption,..
And then you decide to move to europe one day and you hate it there more than in Morocco.
But of course you can't admit that because that would be the same as admitting that you are wrong or have failed and you can't do that. So you shit some more all over your country while being in europe and at the same time missing and ""loving"" your country.

We have good things and we have bad things. But things keep changing. I'm married to an Algerian woman, i have heard a lot of things that are unimaginable in Morocco. In Belgium there is corruption and tax fraud eeeeverywhere, there was a government no one elected and the government currently is run by a bunch of small political parties who banded together because they refuse to give power to the biggest parties (plural!) their own people voted for.

Point is that they openly say democracy is a failed concept and that we don't do western democracy yada yada. There's no plus points to this. The point is that there are no delusions.

Mind you, by no means do I agree with either country. I'm as liberal as they come.

It isn't earning you points but the point I'm making here is, we live in the AUSes, USAs, UKs, Canadas, EUs and Indias of the world. These are the macro democracies afaik. Maybe Brazil too. Each and every one of these countries claims a moral high ground on the two previously mentioned authoritarian nations as ""we have freedom and democracy"" which is true. We can do a 100 things in our lives those people will never be able to do (and that's a wide spectrum of democracies I've given as examples there if you notice. Life in Brazil and India is nothing like the West).

But our countries do hyper authoritarian shit like this and we respond with ""uhh what about China and Russia"", like what? 

At least the Chinese and Russians know where they live, there are no delusions. We don't really do anything to criticise or challenge the authoritarianism in our nations. And no getting rid of Trump means very little really. America is still on the slippery slope, it's just not rolling as fast.

The fact that you lot are so fearful of what I'm suggesting, about our own biases, shows me why countries like Russia are able to fuck with our democracies. This is why you're seeing such a crazy right shift. Because the authoritarianism under the scenes in our democracies isn't being challenged.

Já muitos outros comentários aconselharam acompanhamento psicológico. Como enfermeira, eu aconselho uma visita ao psiquiatra. Essa apatia, ansiedade social e falta de direção são sintomas de depressão e podem ser tratados. Eu passei pelo mesmo (tentativa de suicídio inclusive) e ainda estou a ser acompanhada. O psiquiatra pode depois encaminhar-te para terapia cognitivo-comportamental, que te vai ajudar a superar a ansiedade e ensinar-te estratégias para encarar as dificuldades que aparecerem.

Não é fácil hoje em dia arranjar emprego numa área que gostes sem curso, seja ele um curso técnico ou uma licenciatura. Mas só porque ainda não o fizeste, não significa que é tarde demais. Nunca é tarde para aprender. A questão da falta de dinheiro é mais complicada, mas como disseste, não tens grandes gastos. O meu conselho aqui é pores em ordem a tua saúde mental e depois, quando te sentires com mais confiança, avançares com aquilo que realmente queres.

Quanto à tua mãe, é uma situação delicada. É a tua mãe e tu queres o melhor para ela, mas também tens de pensar no que é melhor para ti. Puseste a tua vida praticamente em pausa para cuidar dela, o que é comendável, mas não necessariamente saudável para um jovem da tua idade. Há recursos que podem ajudar. Na tua área, procura um centro de saúde com uma UCCI (unidade de cuidados continuados integrados). Eles vão a tua casa, avaliam a situação da tua mãe, e dão-te alternativas. Atenção: Não tem necessariamente de ser um lar. Se ela tiver condições, pode receber cuidados de enfermagem no domicílio.

Um conselho de quem já passou pelo que estás a passar: nunca desistas de ti. Vai sempre haver dias mais em que não queres sair da cama ou do quarto por nada, mas faz o esforço -  à medida que o tempo passa, esses dias tornam-se mais raros.

One of the soccer apps has an in-app ratings feature and he's tied with VVD at a rating of ""90/100"", i.e the top CB in the app.

The other day some pundits on the radio mentioned him as one of the top defenders.

He was trending in social media not so long ago (although that might be biased, because I follow a bunch of Bayern accounts, so maybe it's just tailored for me).

Many mentions of him in r/soccer.

Just a few examples of what I've been seeing that made me think that people might possibly rate him at the top.

This isn't me arguing that he is the top in the world, but rather his public perception. And I really don't think that it's because their teams aren't doing well.

Like, Pique not being mentioned shouldn't only be justified by Barcelona's bad form.

We've seen the likes of Godin and Koulibaly put their names out there even when their teams struggle. So I do think that individual quality counts and would still get them enough exposure.

That said; does the world think that Alaba is the top defender in the world? Top 5 maybe? For what reasons?

Eu tentei encontrar um post pra te passar, onde explico o meu username, mas o [pusshfit.io](https://search.pushshift.io/reddit/) tá emperrado, sem mostrar resultados.

E ok, ""babaca"" é uma das traduções, mas se afasta um pouco do contexto que eu quis dar. Se você pegar os refrões de ""Another Brick in the Wall"", do Pink Floyd, tem lá…

 

&gt;All in all it's just another brick in the wall

 

&gt;All in all you´re just another brick in the wall

 

&gt;All in all it was all just bricks in the wall 

 

&gt;All in all you were just bricks in the wall

 

Quando eu entrei no Reddit, tentei escolher o ""brick"" da música, mas já existia.

""Prick"" caía bem, pois a gente não deixa de se sentir um idiota (prick), quando percebemos que estamos enfiados lá, na parede, presos, robotizados, massificados, iguaizinhos a qualquer outro tijolo que se encontra por lá, como mostra o clip da música.

 

A mensagem que há por trás do username é de você lutar pra conseguir se livrar da ""parede"" e buscar o seu próprio destino, tentando entender por sua conta o que realmente se passa no mundo ao seu redor, e não aceitar com apatia o que a cultura de massa tenta enfiar na sua cabeça, forçando todos a pensar e agir de maneira uniforme (like ""bricks in the wall"").

 

Eu te perguntei mais, porque como ""prick"" tem vários sentidos, o teu comentário pareceu ambíguo, poderia ser zoeira ou aprovação, saca?

Você ganhou o meu respeito. 🙏 Obrigado pelo elogio \*blushes\* 😊.

**L'ARTICLE:**

**En Grèce, dans les cendres du camp de réfugiés rasé par les flammes en septembre, nous avons retrouvé le journal de bord tenu, depuis l’intérieur de la « zone mineurs », par les éducateurs de l’OIM, organisation affiliée à l’ONU. Toute la violence dans laquelle ces enfants étaient plongés s’y retrouve consignée. Un document exclusif.**


Il fait froid, ce matin du 18 novembre 2018, sur l’île de Lesbos, en Grèce. Moria, l’immense camp de réfugiés et ses presque 5 000 nouveaux arrivants, se réveille les pieds dans la boue, sous les tentes dégoulinantes de pluie. Fanis*, éducateur de l’Organisation internationale pour les migrations (OIM), une agence affiliée à l’ONU, pénètre dans la « zone sécurisée », l’espace barbelé réservé aux mineurs isolés. Le travailleur social pousse la porte de la réserve et découvre un rat mort dans une caisse à mandarines. Ce n’est pas la première fois que la vermine s’introduit dans les grands conteneurs qui servent de lieux de vie, mais le professionnel persiste à noter la même phrase sur le journal de bord : « Grave problème avec les rats et danger de transmission de maladies aux bénéficiaires ainsi qu’au personnel. »



Fanis n’est pas au bout de ses peines. Pendant la nuit, les pluies diluviennes ont inondé la salle où se trouvent le frigidaire et le chauffage. L’éducateur reprend donc sa plume pour conseiller à ses collègues de porter de « hautes bottes en plastique » afin d’éviter l’électrocution. Pire : le conteneur numéro 5, où dort une partie des enfants, est aussi détrempé. Les petits courent un danger mortel : « Risque d’électrocution », note encore le travailleur social, avant de refermer l’épais journal cartonné.

Avant les incendies du 8 septembre 2020 qui l’ont rasé, Moria était considéré par les ONG comme le « pire » camp de réfugiés d’Europe. Au moment des feux, 12 500 personnes s’entassaient dans la crasse et la misère d’un camp bâti pour 3 100. Parmi eux, entre 300 et 600 mineurs isolés, qui vivaient dans la « zone sécurisée », un espace où ils étaient enfermés pendant la nuit pour leur protection.

C’est l’OIM, organisation affiliée à l’ONU chargée de promouvoir des migrations « ordonnées » mais surtout connue pour organiser des retours vers les pays d’origine, qui avait été choisie pour la coordination de cet endroit sensible. Avec pour mission d’accompagner les jeunes, qui patientaient des mois avant d’être transférés vers la Grèce continentale ou les pays de l’UE.

L’OIM avait donc embauché éducateurs, psychologues, avocats, infirmières et interprètes, nous écrit-elle, afin de « couvrir tous les besoins des enfants ». À savoir : Fanis et ses collègues, les contributeurs du document que nous avons retrouvé dans les cendres de Moria.



Nous sommes une semaine après les incendies, le 16 septembre 2020. La mer de tentes multicolores s’est muée en un paysage de suie à perte de vue. Structures de tentes calcinées, jouets cassés, ustensiles de cuisines éparpillés sur une terre devenue pelée et déserte. C’est là, dans un coin appelé « la jungle », à même le sol, entre deux barquettes de riz avec le logo de l’UE, que nous l’avons trouvé. Le manuscrit avait survécu aux flammes et aux pilleurs, qui ne l’avaient pas jugé digne d’intérêt.

« Zone sécurisée », annonce d’emblée sa couverture. Sur la page de garde, le code wi-fi réservé aux employés de l’OIM. Puis, page après page, dans un grec discipliné, les travailleurs de l’agence ont scrupuleusement noté tous les événements qui ont eu lieu pendant leur tour de garde. Du nombre de croissants aux litres de jus consommés par les « bénéficiaires » en passant par les traitements médicaux avalés. Aussi : les bagarres, les fugues, les dangers courus et les violences subies par les plus vulnérables des résidents de Moria.

Le document manuscrit de 190 pages couvre une période d’environ six mois, de novembre 2018 à mai 2019. Le jour de la dernière note, le 8 mai, Moria compte déjà 2 000 habitants au-dessus de ses capacités. Mais ce n’est que le début de l’escalade. À la fin de l’année, ce sera l’explosion : le nombre des personnes aura quasiment quadruplé (19 256 en janvier 2020). À la lecture du calepin, on se demande pourtant comment la situation a pu encore empirer.

**Nuit noire**

Page après page, on s’aperçoit que les coupures d’électricité – causées notamment par les pluies – représentent un problème majeur pour la petite communauté. Ces interruptions, qui peuvent durer plusieurs jours, empêchent le personnel de surveiller les entrées et sorties. Une catastrophe pour la sécurité des enfants censés être à l’abri des agressions. Le 24 novembre 2018, après plusieurs jours sans courant, au désespoir, Fanis et ses collègues Giannis* et Maria* rouvrent le carnet de bord :

« L’inertie des personnes chargées de l’entretien fait qu’une fois encore nous sommes privés d’électricité, au point de n’avoir pas une seule lumière à l’intérieur et l’extérieur de la zone sécurisée. Tous les jours ou presque nous sommes contraints d’apporter des lampes-torches de chez nous pour essayer de voir, dans le noir complet, qui saute par-dessus les barbelés. Pour pénétrer à l’intérieur ou pour en sortir. Ces conditions de vie sont inacceptables ! En dépit des plaintes répétées des travailleurs sociaux, la situation ne semble pas s’améliorer. »
Extrait : « Le conteneur n° 8 est inondé. Il coule de l’eau à l’intérieur et dans de nombreux endroits. Ce serait bien que les bénéficiaires soient déplacés vers d'autres conteneurs jusqu’à ce que le temps s’améliore. Danger d’électrocution. Le phénomène a également été noté dans d’autres conteneurs mais à plus petite échelle. » Extrait : « Le conteneur n° 8 est inondé. Il coule de l’eau à l’intérieur et dans de nombreux endroits. Ce serait bien que les bénéficiaires soient déplacés vers d'autres conteneurs jusqu’à ce que le temps s’améliore. Danger d’électrocution. Le phénomène a également été noté dans d’autres conteneurs mais à plus petite échelle. »

**Une triste note de Noël**

« JOYEUX NOËL !!! » Pour marquer l’événement, l’éducateur de garde a dessiné de jolies lettres au sommet de la page du 25 décembre 2018. Mais rien n’est jamais joyeux à Moria. S., une adolescente, vient de faire passer un morceau de papier à l’assistante sociale : le nom de son agresseur. Les éducateurs copient l’information avec un crayon de bois, entre autres notes au stylo bleu : « Il l’a battue en dehors de la zone sécurisée alors qu’il était ivre », lit-on. « Nous avons appelé la police, l’officier a envoyé une patrouille à pied. Voyons ce qui va se passer. » Le ton résigné employé par Fannis et son collègue semble indiquer qu’ils ne se font pas d’illusions.
La page du 25 décembre 2018. La page du 25 décembre 2018.

Les travailleurs sociaux reportent qu’un homme est déjà venu se plaindre de S. auparavant. Un peu plus tôt dans la journée, ce dernier s’est présenté à l’entrée. Tonitruant, il avait accusé S. de lui avoir volé de l’argent. Il prétendait lui en avoir déjà donné à plusieurs reprises « en échange de choses qui ne peuvent être décrites ». Les employés de l’OIM lui avaient demandé de partir en lui indiquant que, si quelqu’un lui avait volé de l’argent, il devait s’en plaindre à la police et que la violence n’avait pas sa place ici. « L’homme est parti satisfait… », avait noté le personnel en service.

Interrogé sur les suites données à cette affaire, l’OIM nous fait cette réponse générale : « Un soutien psychologique était proposé aux enfants, afin de prévenir ou résoudre tous les conflits naissants. » L’exploitation sexuelle n’est que l’un des nombreux dangers auxquels les mineurs sont confrontés de l’autre côté des barbelés.

I believe they became more lax with their genetic requirements later on accounting for the amount of Jews in the SS. They ironically evolved their views on race the more countries they invaded.

They didn't. First the only discriminated against Jews, later they used them for forced labor and finally they massacred them. If anything they got more tough.

Nazi Race Theory had categories they ranked from most desirable to least:

1. North German - the purest Aryans, in Germany and Scandinavia

2. South Germans - Aryans, but they have mingled with other races, Bavaria, Austria, Switzerland etc.

&gt; THE Scottish Greens have said they will include a commitment to an independence referendum in their manifesto for the 2021 election as they welcomed Nicola Sturgeon’s promise to hold a new vote in the early part of the next Scottish Parliament.
&gt; 
&gt; Patrick Harvie, the party’s co-convener, gave a positive response to the First Minister’s promise which she made in her closing speech to the SNP conference yesterday afternoon.
&gt; 
&gt; The SNP leader made the announcement as she addressed voters watching her conference speech: “Next May we will ask you, the people of Scotland, to put your trust in us to continue that task of building a better country.
&gt; 
&gt; “I will ask you to judge us on our record and endorse our plans for the future. And in that election, I will seek your authority – no-one else’s – for a legal independence referendum to be held in the early part of the new parliament.”
&gt; 
&gt; Harvie responded: “The Scottish people are the only people who can determine their future, and it is right to say that they alone will decide when and whether there is an independence referendum.
&gt; 
&gt; “Scotland has the right to resume its place as an independent European nation, and the Scottish Greens will go into May’s election committing to a referendum. Our MSPs will be crucial to establishing a pro-independence majority.”
&gt; 
&gt; Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross said the First Minister is “completely out of touch” over her push for a second independence referendum and accused her of “grandstanding” over putting the campaign for one on hold at the start of the pandemic.
&gt; 
&gt; “She grandstanded about putting ‘independence on hold’, which would be a lot more believable if she didn’t launch a new Referendum Bill in September as a second wave of Covid was beginning,” he said.
&gt; 
&gt; “And all weekend she’s been talking up another divisive referendum next year while we’re in the middle of a pandemic. It’s completely out of touch with people across Scotland.
&gt; 
&gt; “Over the years a litany of SNP conference promises have flopped – from the Scottish Growth Scheme to the infamous Sturgeon Energy Company – so I sincerely hope these new commitments materialise but I don’t have much faith that they actually will.”
&gt; 
&gt; Anas Sarwar, Scottish Labour’s shadow constitution minister, said a second independence referendum was the First Minister’s top priority as he also hit out: “Nobody should now be in any doubt – Nicola Sturgeon’s only priority is to further divide our nation at a time when we should be healing,” he said.
&gt; 
&gt; “Her obsession with independence – mentioning it over 20 times in her speech – is shameful when people are losing their lives and livelihoods.
&gt; 
&gt; “On the UK stage she pretends that she has paused the independence campaign to focus on the pandemic, but the truth is that indyref2 remains her top priority.
&gt; 
&gt; “We can’t come straight out of a pandemic and go straight into a divisive referendum. Instead we should be pulling our people together and rebuilding our economy, protecting jobs, fixing our education system and delivering an NHS that never again has to choose between fighting a virus or treating cancer.”
&gt; 
&gt; Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie also attacked the First Minister’s announcement on a second independence referendum.
&gt; 
&gt; “The First Minister has put independence first,” he said.
&gt; 
&gt; “Everything else that needs to be done in Scotland, the mammoth task of recovery in front of us, all of that will have to wait for years in the queue behind another referendum.
&gt; 
&gt; “People who need urgent NHS care, who’s future depends on our education system getting back to being the best in the world or who are counting down the days for mental health support on long wait lists can’t afford to wait years or endure more division.
&gt; 
&gt; “What the people of Scotland need in this period of intense uncertainty is a focus on recovery, not referendums.”
&gt; 
&gt; During her address, the First Minister put forward the case that independent countries of a similar size to Scotland were among the wealthiest and happiest in the world.
&gt; 
&gt; “If Denmark can be a successful independent country, why not Scotland? If Ireland can and Norway can, why not Scotland? We have the resources, the wealth and the talent.” she said, insisting Westminster cannot veto Scotland’s “inalienable right of self-determination”.",True,False,False,,,,0,1606820052,,False,0,{},ge8yeax,True,t3_k4ia9f,False,False,t1_ge8y6t4,/r/Scotland/comments/k4ia9f/greens_commit_to_indyref2_as_nicola_sturgeon/ge8yeax/,False,,1618055536,25,True,False,Scotland,t5_2qkli,r/Scotland,public,,0,[],

&gt;December has arrived and the EU is staring over the cliff-edge and into a budgetary abyss. 

&gt;It’s been more than two weeks since Poland and Hungary brandished their vetoes over the bloc’s €1.8tn budget and Covid-19 recovery package over conditions linked to the rule of law. Now diplomats are increasingly despairing about the chances of an eleventh hour compromise.

&gt;The hard deadline to solve the spat is December 7. This marks the formal end of a legally mandated three-week “conciliation” period when EU governments and MEPs must thrash out the terms of the following year’s annual budget. Even during normal times, conciliation periods often go to the wire. In the grip of the coronavirus pandemic, the consequences of failure are far bigger than the usual end-of-year haggling between MEPs and governments over a few billion euros.

&gt;EU ambassadors will decide on Wednesday whether it is even worth starting 2021 budget negotiations with MEPs given the parlous state of affairs. Hungary’s premier Viktor Orban flew to Warsaw on Monday night for talks with Polish counterpart Mateusz Morawiecki, their second meeting in the past week and the first since demanding “substantial modifications” to the rule of law mechanism.

&gt;Piotr Muller, a spokesman for the Polish government, said on Monday evening Warsaw was “open to proposals” to resolve the rift. “We are convincing our partners that arbitrary criteria for judging the rule of law in certain countries can in the future lead to the collapse of the EU,” he said.

&gt;EU leaders, led by Germany’s Angela Merkel, will aim to break the deadlock at a summit in Brussels at the end of next week. As that is past the December 7 deadline, diplomats are all but resigned to the EU having to resort to an austerity budget known as the “provisional twelfths” for the first time in over 30 years. 

&gt;As the Brussels Briefing has written, this fallback would mean funding for new policy priorities such as health, climate change and migration would disappear. The EU would have to keep paying out subsidies to farmers and civil servants’ salaries, but billions in new structural funds for the poorest member states — including Poland and Hungary — would stop.

&gt;**The commission has told diplomats that in the absence of a budget deal, the lost funding would amount to around €25bn-€30bn a year. That figure does not include the delay to the €750bn pandemic recovery fund that was due to be up and running next year.** 

&gt;As time runs out, member states angered by hardball tactics from Budapest and Warsaw are growing emboldened. The toughest among them are the hard-nosed “frugals”, who think that a few months of an austerity regime and lost billions will force Poland and Hungary back to the negotiating table. These net-paying nations — the Austrians, Danes, Dutch and Swedes — also lose their rebates if there is no agreement. But that’s a blow they seem willing to bear.

&gt;One of the big open questions is how long the state of budget emergency will last. Officials are still considering creative solutions to minimise the financial damage during the EU’s worst recession in history.

&gt;One possible face saving compromise would be a deal over the seven-year budget at the summit. This would allow the spending plan to come into force in early 2021 with only a few weeks delay.

o que corresponde exatamente ao que eu disse lá em cima: é necessário se filiar a toda uma corrente de pensamento filosófico-político pra considerar esses países como democracia (e por consequência todos os outros como ditadura). O que, em minha visão, não chega nem perto de corresponder à nossa complexa realidade

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; O partido representa a vontade do povo, com inúmeros segmentos da sociedade sendo representados 

Aí é que tá, apesar de sistemas unipartidários terem alguma oposição interna elas não são verdadeiras oposições de fato. Isso se dá pelo simples fato de que elas não tem autonomia e a ala governante não tem quaisquer incentivos de aplicar uma que seja de suas medidas e ela não tem força pra angariar apoio e bloquear medidas do governo como um partido de fato o teria. Sem nem entrar no mérito de como a concentração de poder não mãos de um único partido - e, por consequência, nas mãos de um único cômite de gestão partidária - é algo extremamente anti-democrático e autoritário

&gt; quando foi a última vez que você participou de um? 

Eleições? duas semanas. Referendos e Plebiscitos? é verdade, nunca. Mas não vejo um grande problema nisso pois vejo benefícios em uma democracia representativa. Digo isso porque devido à atual situação ideológica do país não seria nada surpreendente um plebiscito definir pela criminalização do comunismo, ou abolição de quaisquer direitos ao aborto legal dentre outras matérias sensíveis.

&gt; EUA é um país bipartidarista, então eles não são uma democracia? 

Os EUA são uma democracia absurdamente atrasada, com instituições que remontam, ao menos, 100 anos de atraso. Eles estão longe de ser o meu ideal de democracia (este muito mais perto da república parlamentarista alemâ). Mas ainda assim, apesar de falha, continua tendo uma incrível participação da população, e até pouco tempo atrás era possível ver representante ignorando as linhas do bipartidarismo e votando leis em conjunto, pois acharem que isso seria o melhor à nação. Isso sem contar que existem partidos menores que, devido ao sistema eleitoral (first past the post + colégio eleitoral) não conseguem grandes resultados em escala nacional, mas existem diversos partidos locais ou até mesmo estaduais que conseguem certa influência no engajamento político de sua região.

&gt; A situação na Venezuela se resume a uma guerra retórica que a oposição muda de argumentação toda semana, vc abraçou a propaganda anti-venezuela, mas a situação é muito mais complexa que isso. 

Aí tu estás assumindo algo que eu nunca disse. Eu ser contra a forma como o governo venezuelano se manteve no poder não implica eu apoiar a sua oposição muito pelo contrário. Acho o Guaidó um pedaço de merda oportunista que jamais deveria ser presidente, mas isso não muda o fato de que o Maduro e seus correligionários erodiram as instituições democráticas venezuelanas e precisam enfrentar as críticas que isso carrega. Digo para que o Maduro renuncie pelo simples fato de que, se ele não o fizer, ou a venezuela continua nesse ciclo vicioso da última década ou acontece um golpe de vez, seja para qualquer um dos lados. Além do mais, até acredito que ele ou um de seus apoiadores poderia ser eleito novamente, enterrando de vez qualquer dúvida a respeito do processo eleitoral do país, nos mesmo moldes do que acabou acontecendo na Bolívia (apesar de lá já ter ocorrido o golpe). Além do mais, caso ele voltasse ao poder em eleições abertas e supervisionadas por instituições internacionais, qualquer problema de legitimidade que ele tivesse seria afastado e a venezuela poderia começar a sair do buraco que ela caiu. Penso nisso numa estratégia estilo de Gaulle pós maio de 68, quando ele dissolveu o parlamento, chamou novas eleições e o partido dele ganhou uma vitória expressiva novamente, reafirmando o seu poder político.

&gt;When the war began in Europe but had not yet been declared in the United States, there was a lot of talk about getting ready and being patriotic. The newspapers had big articles on businessmen volunteering to go to Plattsburg, New York, to do m ilitary training, and so on.  
&gt;  
&gt;I began to think I ought to make some kind of contribution, too. After I finished up at MIT, a friend of mine from the fraternity, Maurice Meyer, who was in the Army Signal Corps, took me to see a colonel at the Signal Corps offices in New York.  
&gt;  
&gt;""I'd like to aid my country sir, and since I'm technicallyminded, maybe there's a way I could help.""""Well, you'd better just go up to Plattsburg to boot camp and go through basic training. Then we'll be able to use you,"" the colonel said. ""But isn't there some way to use my talent more directly?""""No; this is the way the army is organized. Go through the regular way.""  
&gt;  
&gt;I went outside and sat in the park to think about it. I thought and thought: Maybe the best way to make a contribution is to go along with their way. But fortunately I thought a little more, and said, ""To hell with it! I'll wait awhile. Maybe something will happen where they can use me more effectively""

and

&gt;After the thing went off, there was tremendous excitement at Los Alamos. Everybody had parties, we all ran around. I sat on the end of a jeep and beat drums and so on. But one man, I remember, Bob Wilson, was just sitting there moping.  
&gt;  
&gt;I said, ""What are you moping about?""He said, ""It's a terrible thing that we made.""  
&gt;  
&gt;I said, ""But you started it. You got us into it.""  
&gt;  
&gt;You see, what happened to me-what happened to the rest of us--is we started for a good reason, then you're working very hard to accomplish something and it's a pleasure, it's excitement. And you stop thinking, you know; you just stop. Bob Wilson was the only one who was still thinking about it, at that moment.  
&gt;  
&gt;I returned to civilization shortly after that and went to Cornell to teach, and my first impression was a very strange one. I can't understand it any more, but I felt very strongly then. I sat in a restaurant in New York, for example, and I looked out at the buildings and I began to think, you know, about how much the radius of the Hiroshima bomb damage was and so forth . . . How far from here was 34th Street? . . . All those buildings, all smashed--and so on. And I would go along and I would see people building a bridge, or they'd be makin g a new road, and I thought, they're crazy, they just don't understand, they don't understand. Why are they making new things? It's so useless.

I'm not sure to which extent he really had regrets about working on the Manhatttan project, but at that time, the goals was indeed to destroy Hitler (and more importantly, develop a nuclear weapon *before* the nazis did), and their sense of patriotism greatly overshadowed any moral obligations.

&gt;  
&gt;As we now know, in September BiFab lost out on a major contract to contribute to the construction of the Neart Na Gaoithe (NnG) wind farm after Scottish ministers withdrew their offer of a £30 million guarantee. It is hard to see what future the company now has, when it has not been able to compete for this lucrative work, and with few similar opportunities on the near horizon.  
&gt;  
&gt;Facing political criticism from all sides, the SNP Economy Secretary Fiona Hyslop sought to deflect the blame, claiming that EU state-aid rules have made the offer of a guarantee impossible, and complaining of a lack of support from BiFab’s Canadian parent company, JVDriver.  
&gt;  
&gt;Unsurprisingly, she also sought to pass the blame on to the UK government for its “contracts for difference” subsidy scheme for offshore wind which does not attach any conditions requiring the work to be carried out within the UK.  
&gt;  
&gt;Last week, BiFab hit back at the Scottish government for their claims about JVDriver, stating that they were “perplexed and disappointed” at the SNP’s stance. Far from JVDriver standing in the way, BiFab stated, they repeatedly offered to transfer their shares in the Scottish company to the Scottish government at no cost. This offer was not taken up and is still open. Accordingly, the statements of SNP ministers about BiFab have been, in their words, “inaccurate or untruthful”.  
&gt;  
&gt;If this were not damaging enough, the trade unions GMB and Unite joined together to issue a damning statement against the SNP government, demanding that the legal advice underpinning the decision to walk away from BiFab be published, and slamming the government’s announcement last week as “an act of bad faith \[which\] made a mockery of the so-called fair work agenda”.  
&gt;  
&gt;Whilst it is indeed the UK government which grants contracts for difference, on a bidding system, the planning consent for offshore wind projects is in the gift of Scottish ministers, on advice from Marine Scotland. It was therefore entirely under the control of SNP ministers at the time that consent was issued to insert conditions requiring a local employment and training strategy. This was not taken up at the time, and it seems a shameless piece of deflection by the SNP now to try and absolve themselves of all responsibility for the matter, and pass the blame onto others.  
&gt;  
&gt;We were all promised a bright future in terms of manufacturing and engineering jobs from renewable energy in Scotland. At the first hurdle, we have been badly let down.  
&gt;  
&gt;A company like BiFab deserves better than it has had so far from the SNP government, and they have it within their hands to take action now to provide much-needed employment in Fife and on Lewis.

You're wrong on essentially all counts.

1) Many Americans are not ""blinded"" to what other countries are doing, we're well read on the world and other nations.

2) Not being debatable and being agreed upon are two different things.  As Reagan said, ""The closest thing to eternal life is a government program"" because once enacted, people don't want to give them up, even if it would be better for them to do so.  For example, Social Security is BY DEFINITION a Ponzi Scheme, but people feel they've paid into the system, so don't want to give it up even though it would be better for future generations and for anyone under 50 years old to do so.

2b) And it's not even right to say ""most countries"".  More countries in the world don't agree with you than agree with you on this.  You can say ""developed"" all you want, that doesn't change this fact.

3) Socialist, not communist, which it is.

4) ""a few steps behind"" is debatable.  Not all progress is better, nor is all ""forward"" motion getting you ahead.  Europeans are more European, and your own view is horrifically Euro-centric here.

5) The reason the US doesn't have ""middle ground"" is because of the forces stoking and playing both sides against each other.

This may come off as particularly cynical. But I'm not sure how European measures could substitute this amount of exports. And personally, I find it problematic to encourage international exports of products such as wine when there is argumentatively more qualitative (and quantitative) local products. From an environmental as well as a geo-cultural perspective it's not really sustainable. 

With that said, of course I feel some solidarity with Australians and Australian wine makers in particular. But ""buying a bottle or two"" of Australian wine won't make up for the loss of one of the biggest trade partners within that sector.  Instead, it risks rerouting European consumers (albeit temporarily) from supporting European wine makers who've had one of the the worst years in recent times.

I wouldn’t be surprised if multiple distributors have a “most favored nation” clause with a programmer or two, and they think they’re the only one who has it.

In Europe it’s much more straightforward, and more expensive. Nearly all sports programming channels are forced on the absolute most expensive packages. If you want BT Sport or Sky Sports, it’s (generally) an additional $30 USD per month to get just one group of those sports channels.

Imagine a world where you have a base local/entertainment package of channels for $40, but if you want the suite of ESPN/SEC/ACC channels that’ll be $30 more per month. Want FS1/FS2/BigTen? That’ll be $20 more per month. Want RSN’s? That’ll be an additional $10 per month.

How is riding a factory team with a bike capable of top 10 (or even top 5), capable of qualifying top row is ""losing a year"" of his carrer?

&gt;It literally is far off, revist this season's stats. Aprilia started out alongside KTM and Suzuki, look how far ahead they are now.

The bike did 2 top 10 finishes with Aleix Espargaro, a pretty average rider. Aleix didn't do better than 11th in the championship in the Suzuki. Even a pretty low rent rider like Bradley smith was having competitive pace.Iannone would have put a much better show. It's the worse bike on the grid, but the bike is competitive.

In Portugal, Aleix finished only 4 seconds behind his brother Pol in the KTM who finished 4th. In Valencia he finished 15 seconds behind the lead rider, ahead of both Factory Yamaha riders, Bagnaia, Petrucci, Cruthclow, etc... Again... with Aleix Espargaro... A guy that is racing in Motogp since 2004 and only got 1 podium in his entire career (moto2).

Put a race winning guy in that bike and it would perform much much better. Not saying he's going to win the championship, but I feel like the bike is capable of the odd podium with a good rider.

&gt;A non-European rider cannot stake his career on *might be* though. Why discard the opportunity to perform in a championship winning team? Even a runner-up would get him a satellite ride from better teams in the future.

Why? because the guys is 23 years old and is riding Moto2 bikes for 4 years. Next year will be his 4th complete season in Moto2. His previous finishes were 27th, 28th and 7th... And hes offered a Factory GP ride lol.

he's a decent rider but I don't seem him winning the championship or even finishing top 3. He's not going to land a seat in a top MotoGP team, Aprilia was a good oportinity that he might never get.

&gt;A step down after a dismal year or two with Aprilia guarantees he'll never join the premiere class grid again. That's what he has to lose.

He got to be there and got his oportunity. Staying in moto2 might not even get him in gp ever. He has to step up big time from previous seasons to even get a chance at a GP seat.

Look at Zarco, needed to win the championship 2x to get a GP seat. This season was an outlier, because 3rd or 4th place in moto2 don't give you GP rides.Baldassari is a better rider than Roberts and never got a GP ride.

Moto2 is tought! That's why rider likes like Oliveira grab the GP ride as soon as possible, and rider like miller don't go to Moto2 at all.

no entanto, não entendo como uma criptomoeda evitaria ou diminuiria a concentração dos meios de produção. eu não consigo nem imaginar criptomoedas como mecanismos eficientes de redução do capital fictício.. na verdade, o contrário... vide o mercado de derivativos montado em cima de bitcoins. e veja que vc pode criar qualquer moeda com qualquer variação de oferta.. fora o fato de que, inclusive, temos proof of stake como mecanismo de recompensa.

mesmo o sonho do fim do Estado (que não é sinônimo de comunismo), não me parece tangível por criptomoedas. o q impediria o Estado de cobrar um valor elevado por propriedade na ausência da taxação de renda/transação?

por sinal, não acho que criptomoeda mude alguma coisa da estrutura macro... nem acho essa mudança exista com os modelos de organizações descentralizadas (pois nao tiram a concentração dos meios de produção). esses modelos nem são tão diferentes da propria moeda fiat (no caso da criptomoeda).. ou das associações de trabalhadores do sec XIX contratados de forma independente (terceirizada, no caso das organizações descentralizadas).

[],,PseudoDaniel,,,,[],,,,text,t2_5osyawpn,False,False,[],"Hi, I'm the guy that made the map responsible for this mess of a timeline :) Here's some official lore:

&amp;#x200B;

\-France remains a heavily decentralized kingdom, with the sun king unable to create a unified state. 

 \-The Habsburg realm is much larger, with the creation of the kingdom of Burgundy. Part of the Netherlands remains under Habsburg control as the Duchy of Holland. Milan remains part of Spain. 

 \-The Habsburg realm is split into three parts: Burgundy, Austria &amp; the H.R.E., and Spain with Naples and Milan.  

\-The H.R.E. is much more centralized and is lead by Austria. Burgundy is starting to become a threat to Austrian domination in Germany. 

 \-Protestantism remains dominant in the Nordic countries. The H.R.E. tolerates Protestantism as a result of the bloodshed of the thirty years war but the religion remains a minority, with catholicism being the main force.  

\-Italy is heavily dominated by Spain except for Savoy, which remains a strong power in the region.  In 1802 a certain revolt in Tuscany lead Napoleon Buenoparte to take power, with his liberal ideas in hand, he created the 'First Italian Empire', and after the course of 10 years lead a mostly successful campaign that ended after an unsuccessful invasion of mainland Spain. He was exiled, but his successor Louis-Napoleon is a prominent figure in Italy who could possibly continue the family tradition.

\-The United Kingdom still experiences the civil war, but the glorious revolution fails. Spain, Austria, and the H.R.E. form a coalition to put James II on the throne of the U.K., they succeed. Also, because the Netherlands doesn't exist in this timeline, there isn't a strong candidate against him. In 1750, England, Scotland and Ireland are ruled by King James III, son of James II.  

\-Prussia never manages to become the strong militarist, protestant kingdom that it is in our world, as the H.R.E. is dominated by a coalition of Catholic states. As a result, Poland-Lithuania is never forced to concede territory to it and remains a great power. The only possible enemy to it would be Sweden, though it is still recovering from the thirty years war.  -Russia still manages to westernize, but unlike in OTL, Peter I is sent to Austria instead of Holland, and as a result, Russia has much more closer ties to Austria. Instead of OTL, Catherine the great never becomes empress, as she is a protestant, and Russia has heavy ties to catholic Austria.

THE HABSBURGS:      

Austria  

\-The H.R.E. becomes a centralized state after the reforms of the Habsburgs. No more feudalsim and in fighting. There is a revolt from the northern mostly protestant states (Barndenburg-Prussia, Hannover, Hesse, Saxony) but they are quickly crushed and the H.R.E. becomes one nation. Now, the Austrian Habsburgs put Hungary into the H.R.E. as one of it's three constituent kingdoms: Germany, Bohemia and itself. The Austrian foreign policy is slightly conservative. 

Burgundy  

\-First created as a minor branch of the Habsburg realm, Burgundy conquered it's surrounding city states and became a rival of the H.R.E. After the empire's centralization, it was the only German state to completely brake away from it and form it's own kingdom. Surprisingly, Burgundy is supportive of France and financed it's return from feudalsim (more on that later), and was the first european monarchy to have a constitution. Burgundy's ambitions lie in Switzerland and overseas, as the nation heavily supports colonization of America and India. It is by far the most liberal of the Habsburg realms.  

3) Spain  -The most important of the three, Spain remained the largest European power. After a series of wars in Italy, it managed to unify the northern Italian states and secure an alliance with the Pope. A war with the Ottomans granted them the Peloponnes. Spain is the most conservative and religious nation in Europe. It never lost it's colonies and still has most of South America under it's control.

FRANCE 

 \-After the 30 years war, France was shattered into a heavily feudalist nation with no real power held by the king. Even the ambitions of Louis XV couldn't centralize the nation. In 1779 a nationalist coup by Anne Robert Jacques Turgot in Versailles forced Louis XVI to abdicate in favour of a republic. This government is not similar to the french republic of OTL, but instead resembles the Dutch republic in OTL, with a heavy focus on centralization and trade. The new government was quickly met with resistance, as a number of religious nobles from the south decided to seek indepndence. Heavily backed by Spain, they succeeded. France maintains good relations with the Burgundian monarchy.   

BRITAIN  

 \-After an attempt at removing the catholic James III from the throne, the powers of Europe quickly threaten military intervention if the stuart monarch was not reinstated. As a result, Britain remained a catholic nation under a Stuart monarch well into the start of the XIX century. The thirteen colonies never formed, as Britain never focused on colonial development, with matters at home being more pressing. North America was mainly a mix of Burgundian colonies, failing Austrian outposts and French trading ports.   

RUSSIA   

\-Basically, not a lot changes, except Peter III and Catherine II never make it to the throne (with them being protetant and all), so Russia is much more close with Autria (as seen by the flag). Poland is never partitioned but rather just eaten away by Russia.

NORTH AMERICA

Neue Lotharingia.  

A colony of the Kingdom of Burgundy, the most liberal monarchy in Europe, Neue Lotharingia is the second most populated colony in the region, with the most cities and infrastructure. After the treaty of Westphalia, the British colonies in New England were given to the then newly formed Kingdom of Burgundy. It has an ethnic makeup of mainly protestant refugees from the low countries, englishmen, germans, and frenchmen. It is the most ethnically diverse colony in North America. Its main rival is the British colony of Carolina.   

2) Francis's Land  A colony of the Austrian Habsburgs and the H.R.E., it was created after the first French holdings in North America were given to them in the treaty of Westphalia. Sparsely populated, the two main cities: Neue Vienna and Neue Graz, are mere villages, and little stand in the way of a conquest from the U.K., except for retaliation in Europe.   

3) Carolina and Nova Scotia  The remaining colonies of the U.K., they were the only ones to be left to the U.K. after their brief attempt at installing an protestant monarch - William of Orange. Carolina is the more developed of the two, but stands between the colonial powerhouses of Spain and Burgundy. Nova Scotia is a trading outpost with strong military presence, but little inhabitants.

Iles  Occidentales, Terre de Liberte, Terre Republicaine, and the French West  Indies :

4) After the coup of Thurgot, and installation of the republic, France  quickly turned its attention to trade, and began to quickly set up major  cities in North America and the Carribean. They are the most profitable  parts of North America, with storng naval protection and developed  infrastructure. Most have a large west african population along with a  diverse european upper class.   

5) New Spain  The center of the new world, the Spanish colony is the most populated in  the region, and is envied by all those around it. Nothing much can be  said about it, except for the fact that it is a highly prized posession  and a possible spark for war.   

6) Scandinavian colonies  Nya Sverige and the Danish West Indies are one of the last fully  protestant places in North America. They aren't as well protected and  could soon be taken by France and Burgundy   

7) The Meer Republiek and the Calvinist State  Founded by Dutch protestants from Burgundy, these are two militarised  nations, situated on the outskirts of civilization. Heavily reliand on  guerilla tactics and cooperative with natives, they are hard to conquer.  While allied, they have their differences. For one, the Meer Republiek  is a secular state, while the Calvinist State is a religious one. They  will likely be the first of many unrecognized protestant republics.",True,False,False,,,,0,1606828548,,False,0,{},ge97nby,False,t3_k4kdbh,False,False,t3_k4kdbh,/r/victoria2/comments/k4kdbh/germany_and_the_hre_in_the_upcoming_mod_la_era/ge97nby/,False,,1618059982,156,True,False,victoria2,t5_2uadi,r/victoria2,public,,0,[],

&gt; # [España sufre la peor recesión del mundo después de la de Argentina, según la OCDE](https://www.abc.es/economia/512)
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt; MADRID Actualizado:01/12/2020 12:25h&lt;a data-btn=""starred"" data-id=""1683a54a-3324-11eb-9029-2a34b475b66d"" data-nibara-module=""starred"" data-type=""noticia"" data-voc-vtm-id=""leerdespues"" data-voc-vtm-info=""sticky"" title=""Guardar el artículo""&gt; Guardar &lt;/a&gt;La destrucción de actividad ha vuelto de la mano de la segunda ola y cada vez más organismos alertan de que habrá una recaída en los tres últimos meses del año. El último ha sido la Organización para la Cooperación y el Desarrollo Económico (OCDE), que en sus últimas previsiones económicas mundiales alerta del **«fuerte aumento de contagios» en España** que, junto a los nuevos confinamientos y demás, provocará «una contracción en el cuarto trimestre». De esta forma, si la institución dibujaba dos escenarios en sus anteriores previsiones, según hubiera o no rebrote, el avance de 2020 permite [afinar el tiro y ya augura un solo escenario.](https://www.abc.es/economia/abci-espana-perdio-15-millones-empleos-ritmo-tres-veces-mayor-202009082125_noticia.html) Y si bien no se cumplen los peores pronósticos de junio, que recogían una caída de hasta un 14,4% este año ya que la segunda ola no ha sido tan dañina como la primera, **España sufrirá la segunda mayor recesión entre los 46 estados analizados por la OCDE, solo superada por Argentina.**
&gt; 
&gt; Nuestro país recogerá una **caída del PIB del 11,6%.** Solo Argentina, con las medidas de confinamiento más agudas en el planeta, experimenta una caída mayor, del 12,9% en 2020, mientras que la tercera economía con un mayor desplome será Reino Unido, con un -11,2%. Para el próximo año, la OCDE pronostica para España una recuperación del 5% que será del 4% en 2022.
&gt; 
&gt; A mitad de 2020, la economía española había cosechado **la mayor caída de la OCDE después de la India**, perdiendo más de un 21% de la actividad. Sin embargo, el crecimiento del 16,7% en verano permitió acortar las diferencias, aunque la OCDE resalta que en septiembre el número de turistas era un 87,1% menor al de un año antes, mientras que el gasto con tarjeta de los extranjeros se había desplomado un 65% en octubre. Había mucho por recuperar, una herida que ahora vuelve a abrirse con los confinamientos de otoño.
&gt; 
&gt; ### Europa dobla la recesión de EE.UU.
&gt; 
&gt; La caída este año, así, es la mayor de Europa, siendo **el doble que el -5,5% de Alemania** y superando a **Italia** (-9,1%), **Francia** (-9,1%), **Portugal** (-8%) o **Grecia** (-10,1%). El Gobierno prevé una recesión del -11,2% este año y una recuperación del 9,8% en 2021 (con un impacto de 1,6 puntos de crecimiento proveniente del efecto tractor de los fondos europeos).
&gt; 
&gt; [Europa, de hecho, es una de las zonas más afectadas por la pandemia](https://www.abc.es/tmp/economia/abci-espana-sufrira-mayor-recesion-mundo-si-rebrote-caida-144-por-ciento-202006101006_noticia.html). La Eurozona se contraerá un 7,5%, el doble que Estados Unidos (-3,7%) y lejos de China, origen de la epidemia y que arroja un crecimiento previsto este año del 1,8%. Se **trata del único país que crecerá este año** entre los analizados por el organismo.
&gt; 
&gt; ### Las restricciones hunden los servicios
&gt; 
&gt; La OCDE augura para España que si se recupera la demanda externa y el turismo, nuestro país experimentará un crecimiento mayor, y constata, eso sí, que la industria está comportándose bastante mejor que los servicios, muy afectados por las limitaciones a la actividad y de movilidad.
&gt; 
&gt; «Los indicadores de actividad manufacturera continúan recuperándose, **pero los de servicios registraron una caída más pronunciada, debido a las nuevas medidas de contención**», resalta.
&gt; 
&gt; ### La salida de los ERTE se frena
&gt; 
&gt; En cuanto al mercado laboral, nuestro país tendrá el próximo año la segunda mayor tasa de paro de los países analizados: un 17,4%, solo superado por el 17,8% de Grecia. Para 2020 cree que el desempleo acabará en el 15,8% gracias, en parte, a los ERTE. «El número de trabajadores que seguía en ERTE en octubre representó un 18% del pico de abril. Sin embargo, **el ritmo de salida se ha ralentizado**, y los trabajadores restantes se concentran en los sectores y regiones más afectados por la crisis», señala.
&gt; 
&gt; **Entre los riesgos que pueden hundir aún más la economía**, la OCDE cita [«efectos más persistentes sobre la solvencia de los hogares y las empresas»](https://www.abc.es/economia/abci-pandemia-resucita-fantasmas-crisis-europa-202003140239_noticia.html). «Una prolongación de la crisis puede empujar a empresas viables a la insolvencia», concluye la OCDE.
&gt; 
&gt; Las nuevas medidas, en palabras de la institución, deben ayudar a los más damnificados por los nuevos confinamientos, reclama la OCDE, además de fomentar el reciclaje formativo entre los trabajadores afectados por ERTE. El organismo, en definitiva, llama al Gobierno a **continuar con las medidas de protección**, además de aprobar reformas que eleven la productividad y que afronten la «fragmentación» del mercado interno.
&gt; 
&gt; Como fuere, el impacto en las arcas públicas se materializará con un déficit del 11,7% este año, del 9% el que viene y del 6,6% aún en 2022, que llevará a la deuda pública a dispararse al 117,3% del PIB este año. Pese al crecimiento, esta seguirá aumentando en 2021 (120,5%) y 2022 (122,4%), mientras no se cierre el boquete en las cuentas públicas. **Se trata del mayor déficit de la Eurozona.**
&gt; 
&gt; ### Reforma de la Ley de Segunda Oportunidad
&gt; 
&gt; La **OCDE reclama leyes de segunda oportunidad** más amplias para los empresarios que hayan caído en quiebra por la crisis y quieran volver a reflotar su negocio o crear uno nuevo, a través de «la exención de pagar la deuda contraída con los ingresos futuros por la liquidación». Y revela que el Ejecutivo contempla algunas de estas medidas.
&gt; 
&gt; «Muchos países ya están reduciendo el tiempo para volver a darse de alta sin obligaciones pasadas a tres años para estar en línea con la Directiva de la UE sobre insolvencia y segunda oportunidad (por ejemplo, Alemania), pero podrían intentar acelerar esta parte de la reforma, lo que puede facilitar las reestructuraciones (por ejemplo, España está considerando esta opción)», abunda la OCDE.

However DoTD and HellBent showed us a much more complex relationship, the Doctor wishing Gallifrey was as it used to be before the War (ironic for how much he chastised them for being a stagnant civilisation in Classic who and EU and now he wants it all how it used to be), but aware of how damaged and changed his people are by the war and its effects.

And when he saves it in DOTD we see him now wanting to *go home*. To see if what he saved was Gallifrey of old (and possibly of its future) who bound themselves to watch over reality. Or Gallifrey of the War (desperate. Dangerous. Ruthless in extremis).

And in HellBent we see....it’s a bit of both. Remnants of War Gallifrey with Rassilon at the centre trying to keep the population in that military and hard edged mindset. And then the Doctor freeing his people from that shackle and leaving them to be what they choose to be.

Not True? Feylis are in Fact Kurdish,nor Lurs,They were known as ""Feyli Kurds"" for most of History,They themselves Speak an Dialect that's apart of the Southern Kurdish Language.


&gt;and they are heavily pushing kurdification towards Lak people that are lurs


 ""Heavily Pushing Kurdification"" are you Joking or Just Spitting Gibberish? The Laks are an Kurdish group and they have NOTHING to do with Lurs,in fact, They're Completely an Seperate People from Lurs.

Actually,the Term ""Lur"" itself is not a proper set term, they are just a group of tribes who inhabit Lorēstan. Such groups are Laks, Bakhtiaris,Mamasani etc, They speak a variety of dialects, and the Laks speak  Laki which is similar to Luri but an different language.


And Plus,the Laks themselves are Classified as An Kurdish tribe, that's an Undeniable Fact,Laki Is also Classified as an Kurdish dialect by most Linguists. Vladimir Minorsky,also  referred to the Laks as ""the most southern group of Kurd tribes in Persia"" and stated that their language has the characteristics of the Kurdish language.

Laks themselves are [spread] (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/763826503783284770/780817167049687040/IMG_20201124_182817.jpg) out with other Kurdish tribes and some Kurdish tribes also have Laki Kurdish Origns as well.

 Sources:

 [1] - [Iranica Online] (https://iranicaonline.org/articles/lak-tribe)  : ""The main ethnic marker of the Lak is their language called “Laki.”  On the basis of the linguistic fieldwork made by the German linguist Oskar Mann, Vladimir Minorsky mentioned the Lak as “the most southern group of Kurd tribes of Persia” (Minorky, “Lak,” p. 616).  After field research made by Oskar Mann, there remained until recently no doubt about the nature of the Laki language.  After the death of Oskar Mann, Karl Hadank continued to work on the material collected by him.  Both of these linguists declared that Laki was related to Kurdish and different from Lori.  Since then, all linguists and other scholars consider Laki to be included in the Northwest group of Iranian language and include Lori among the Southwest group of Iranian languages.  It has been only recently that some linguists, on the basis of a new scientific approach, have begun to have doubt about this kind of classifications in general.  Moreover, Oskar Mann had rightly found that the difference between Laki and other southern Kurdish dialects to be only minor (“nur unwesentlich”; Mann, p. xxiii).  Therefore, he puts Laki along with other south Kurdish dialects under the general rubric “Laki” (Mann, p. xxvii).  What is more, in a list compiled by J. L. Rousseau at Kermanshah in 1807, several south Kurdish tribes like the Kalhor, Māfi, Ṣufiwand, Karkuʾi, Jalilvand, and Kolyāʾi have been classified among the Laki tribes (Rousseau, pp. 85-98).""

Anyways,Zazas *Are* an Kurdish Group,The They are undeniably a Kurdish Group,The Zazas are a Kurdish Group,The Overwhelming Majority of them Consider themselves to be Kurdish.


 From the Wikipedia page : 

""""The Zazas (also known as Kird, Kirmanc or Dimili) are a people in eastern Turkey who speak the Zaza language. Their heartland consists of Tunceli and Bingöl provinces and parts of Elazığ, Erzincan and Diyarbakır provinces. Zazas generally consider themselves Kurds, and are often described as Zaza Kurds.""""

It is a huge collection of Sources which classify the Zazas as an Kurdish Group,and their language as an Kurdish Dialect.

As for the Hewramis/Gorani People,They are Classified as an Kurdish Group not only by Western Sources but also by [Iranian Enclopaedias] (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/763826503783284770/783310604802457630/IMG_20201201_153627.jpg) ,The Article also states that Laks are an Kurdish Tribe,as well.

Furthermore, the Guran (as 'Kurani') poped up as a Kurdish tribe since the Middle Ages frequently,I'm sure one of the medieval Arabic-language geographers mentions the Kurani (remember that Arabic script originally had no 'G', so they used 'K'), perhaps it was Masudi or Hamawi.

Sharafxan also mentions the Kurani,As well a Sharafnama,which states that the Kurdish Tribes of Iran are as follows :

""Kurds of Iran: Lek, Zend, Rozbehan, Metîlec, Hasîrî, şehrezolî, Mezyar, Kelanî, Emînlû, Memeloyî, Kec, Kuranî, Ziktî, Kelegîr, Pazûkî, Wehî, çemîşgezek, ‘Erebkîrlû. Qerebax: Yîrmîdört. Xorasan: Kêl.""

Now,Moving on to the Goranî Language,we can see that All the Goranî dialects are influenced by Kurdish lexically and morphologically,And Plus,Almost all Re-Searchers Consider Goranî an Kurdish Dialect.

The Sources regarding my claims are as follows :

Tavadze,At Bulletin of the Georgian National Academy of Sciences,Year 2019,It starts with : ""The Kurdish language belongs to the Indo-Iranian linguistic group, which in turn is a part of the Indo-European linguistic family. Living for centuries in a vast area of the Middle East, where harsh physical-geographic and political environment prevailed, was one of the main causes of division of the Kurdish pra-language into several distinct dialects. These dialects continued to subdivide, which resulted in the appearance of distinguished subdialects. Besides the three main dialect groups (Northern or Kurmanji; Central or Sorani and Southern Kurdish), there are two more languages or dialects – Zaza (Zazaki) and Gorani. They are used in the remotest parts of the Kurdish ethnic region and a number of western and Kurdish specialists even consider them as not related to the Kurdish language. However, the speakers of Zaza and Gorani consider themselves Kurdish. Three dialects developed their own literature and two of them – Kurmanji and Sorani – are competing for superiority.""


[3] - An [Re-Search Gate] (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/295093908_Automatic_Kurdish_Dialects_Identification) Article titled ""Automatic Kurdish Dialects Identification"" by Hossein Hassani [University of Kurdistan Hewlêr] And Dzejla Medjedovic [International University of Sarajevo],Year 2016,it starts with : ""Automatic dialect identification is a necessary Language Technology for processing multidialect languages in which the dialects are linguistically far from each other. Particularly, this becomes crucial where the dialects are mutually unintelligible. Therefore, to perform computational activities on these languages, the system needs to identify the dialect that is the subject of the process. Kurdish language encompasses various dialects. It is written using several different scripts. The language lacks of a standard orthography. This situation makes the Kurdish dialectal identification more interesting and required, both form the research and from the application perspectives.""

I don't know what to say, dude.

That's... not that bad right?"" and others that say ""omg thousands?! We need to act!"". I belong to the first group, because I've been following other illnesses the last few years, and while this one is a bit worse, it's still not THAT bad. Why is it that suddenly, now, we care so much?

If you want to base your argument on the Arabs being the true rulers of Israel, and Arabic culture being the correct culture for Israel, rather than the culture of a mere  minority - you're not going to win that argument. I mean, you can make very compelling points, but Israelis aren't going to be convinced by something like that.

If you ignore that point, then yes, it's generally a great thing for the minority to learn the language of the majority, and integrate into the majority society. Jews self-segregated for centuries in Europe, and it only fostered centuries of oppression. The moment some Jews abandoned it, started learning the majority language, and going to ""Christian"" schools, they became prime ministers and captains of industry, and created the idea of an integrated Jewish-Christian society we know today.

Note that I personally think Israeli Jews should learn Arabic, and we should be a bilingual society. But Israeli Jews don't really suffer that much from not knowing Arabic, or not being integrated into the Arab Israeli society. While the Arab Israelis suffer quite a bit from the inverse.

&gt;Furthermore, the lawsuit works within Israeli law. Israeli law doesn't compel the local government to establish Jewish-Arab unsegregated schools. That was requested by the residents, but the municipality rejected it.

**Platforms**: PC, PS4/PS5 

**Hours**: Mostly NA On the PC side. NA and EU on the ps4 side.  

**Focus**: Become best friends with the murderous AI and his robot children

Our focus is on PvE and endgame content but that doesn’t stop us from jumping in to some semi sweaty PvP. We are not a group of super tryhards but we also don’t like to mess around and spend hours in raids doing stuff just for the luls.

**About Us**: We're Seraphim Elite, Born in 2016, we're a community of guardians split over PC and PS4, with a clan for each platform. We have an ongoing mission of making an active community and not just an active clan. We believe that what you put in is what you will get out. This isn’t our clan, it’s your clan. While this community is mostly centered on destiny we are a place where people can come together and joke and talk about anything from video games to sports and life in general. 

**Requirements**: We do NOT provide carries (Unless you are named Omnislash) and we don't provide welfare engrams. Being a good raider is important, but being a good raid member is more important. We want to find people that are a good fit in our community. You will be accepted into the clan upon joining our discord but initially as a recruit. We have a process our new people go through so you can get a feel for the clan and our members before you become a full fledged Seraphim. Find out more about this process when you join our discord server.

**Criteria for joining**

1) Be 18+ Physically and mentally.  

2) Have a mic/headset. If we can hear your game or it sounds like you are playing inside a helicopter or in the middle of the freeway you will be asked to leave until you can find a proper headset.

3) Be able to communicate and listen. Be honest about your experience level.

4) Be active in **Discord** and in game.

5) No ~~fucking~~ swearing (This is a joke because some people are bad at jokes or understanding jokes. So you can swear if you want, or don’t swear (I am not the swear police)

6) Speaking of jokes we like to have a good time but being edgy, or racist, or homophobic will put you on the fast track to bansville. 
7) Have very strong opinions on what kind of toppings are appropriate for pizza. Also Mayo. Also cookies. Be ready to fight over your opinions. We are not a judgmental group until it comes to your food choices. 

8) No political conversations or memes. Those topics are too polarizing and only serve to drive people apart. We want our community to be about games. 


Participation in our **DISCORD** server is essential. We do check for in game and Discord activity but the requirements of this activity are minimal (speak a few times a month). We are focused on our community and building online friendships so we feel these requirements should be easy to satisfy. 

Follow the link below to our discord server to get started, and if you can't cause the site is down please wait until it's back up to follow the link!

If you reply to this I will try to get back to you as soon I can. Your best bet to get ahold of me is to join our discord. Follow the bungie link below to get a link for our discord server

I do completely understand the issue with the long hours. However, like I mentioned before, residents in Europe, in general, work less hours but finish their residencies not being completely autonomous, even more so in surgical specialities. It is not about not having yet done any fellowship, it is just how the system works. In some countries, like Switzerland for example, opportunities to actually operate during residency are very limited. In Switzerland, one starts to truly operate more, only after one obtains the specialist title. This very often happens also in Germany but with more variability, it highly depends on the teaching culture of a given hospital. So my point is, yes it sucks to work 10-20h/week more in the US but at the end of the road, you guys are closer to independence than we are here in Europe. In the US you finish your residency and you feel like an attending. Here in Europe we finish our residency and we still feel like residents but with more responsibility and accountability.

Then again, with this independence being achieved in the US, you don't actually have to settle for the shity work that you may have at one given hospital. The system allows you to change, to go somewhere else or to even say ""f*ck you all, I am going to open my own practice"". We also may get this opportunities in Europe but I assure you it happens much later in our careers.

So is it worth it to work 10-20h/week and achieve autonomy earlier? Well, depends on the perspective. For me personally, I would sacrifice those 10-20h, so that I get more freedom to do what I want, how I want, in 4-6 years time. Yet, I understand, and respect, both perspectives.

Well, those 150-190k in Netherlands are surely before tax, as well as the 90k in Germany are also before tax. I am not familiar with how much taxes people actually pay in the US, but in Germany, by earning something like 90k, it means that they will take away over 40% of that. So yeah, that means getting like 5k a month after tax, roughly (I didn't bother to the the math exactly and I also don't know the exact percentage for each tax bracket in Germany). So, with that 1000 dollar/month plan to pay off your debt, that means 20% of your salary. This is huge.

Working as a doctor in the US means being upper class, while working as a doctor in Europe means being middle class in terms of salary until the days your joints will start to ache due the osteoarthritis. Then again, it always boils down to perspective: making 300-400k/year + having the high probability to work in a hospital with super bad work culture vs getting 100k + pay higher taxes + not being autonomous for a very long time but working overall a tad less hours per week.",True,False,False,,,,0,1606832667,,False,0,{},ge9e0l5,False,t3_k3khu8,False,True,t1_ge9ahuk,/r/medicalschoolEU/comments/k3khu8/any_medical_students_or_residents_in_the/ge9e0l5/,False,,1618062983,1,True,False,medicalschoolEU,t5_1ey1ud,r/medicalschoolEU,public,,0,[],

In general, Russians drink loose leaf tea more than Europeans or Americans, who almost always use teabags. At least that was my impression. It's common to add some herbs to tea, like mint, melissa or thyme, although high quality tea is usually used without any additions. Japanese tea is not that popular - matcha is only gaining popularity and it's not that easy to find, while genmaicha or hojicha is quite a niche drink, and I don't know anyone who likes to drink sencha at home, although you can find it in many restaurant menus.

&gt; Those hoping for a semblance of calm in the Middle East in the final days of Donald Trump’s presidency have been rudely awakened by the assassination of Iran’s top nuclear scientist. Iranian leaders immediately blamed Israel for last week’s killing of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh. Israel typically neither denies nor confirms such hits, preferring ambiguity to accountability, while reinforcing the mystique of its secret services. But it is hard to imagine any other state conducting such an audacious attack. And the two leaders it serves most are Mr Trump and Israel’s premier Benjamin Netanyahu, a like-minded hawk on Iran.
&gt; 
&gt; The assassination ramps up Middle East tensions after months of relative calm, and risks making it far harder for Joe Biden to fulfil his pledge to open negotiations with Iran and rejoin the 2015 nuclear accord if Tehran agrees to return to full compliance with the deal. Mr Trump and Mr Netanyahu both appear bent on doing their best to scupper the US president-elect’s chances before he settles into the White House.
&gt; 
&gt; Since his election defeat, the fear in the region has been that Mr Trump could lash out at Iran or its allies in a parting shot that would dash hopes of bringing Tehran back to the table. Last month, he reportedly asked senior advisers for options to strike Iranian nuclear facilities, before being dissuaded from taking military action. But if Mr Netanyahu wanted to order a strike against the Islamic regime, when better to do it than when one of the most anti-Iranian and pro-Israeli US presidents is still in office?
&gt; 
&gt; Mr Trump has already done his utmost to destroy the nuclear deal that Tehran signed with world powers and isolate Iran after unilaterally withdrawing the US from the accord and imposing the severest of sanctions regimes. Yet his “maximum pressure” strategy has failed.
&gt; 
&gt; True, Washington’s measures have pushed Iran’s economy into deep recession. But they have inflamed a volatile region. They have empowered Iranian hardliners and their militant proxies, while exposing the vulnerabilities of the US’s Gulf partners, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
&gt; 
&gt; While Iran had significantly reduced its nuclear activity under the accord, moreover, Mr Trump’s actions led to Tehran expanding its atomic programme. Today, its stockpile of enriched uranium is 12 times what it was before he abandoned the deal.
&gt; 
&gt; Iran has, however, remained in the accord with the backing of the UK, France, Germany, China and Russia, the deal’s other signatories. While recognising flaws in the nuclear deal and sharing criticisms about Iran’s actions, European powers have deemed it the best tool to prevent a regional arms race and to use as a platform on which to build any future negotiations.
&gt; 
&gt; The EU rightly condemned Fakhrizadeh’s assassination as a “criminal act”. The European signatories must now step up their diplomatic efforts to create a conducive environment to boost the chances of dialogue between Tehran and Washington once the Biden administration takes office. The Iranian regime has vowed revenge for Fakhrizadeh’s killing, but should avoid being goaded into retaliation.
&gt; 
&gt; The nuclear accord failed to tackle many of the concerns western and regional powers harbour about Iran’s malign actions, from militias to missiles. But it provides a far better starting point than the tempestuous Trump years, during which the region perpetually feared it was on the brink of war. Mr Biden’s task was already highly complex. This reckless and dangerous assassination only reinforces the need for dialogue among all parties.

Arguments for guns differ by country. In the US, , saying ""target shooting is fun"" this is a rather weak argument. This is not because it is wrong, but because there are ***far stronger***  arguments for gun ownership based on constitutional rights of the individual.

I'm Canadian. Here, gun ownership is a privledge, so no second amendment for us. Instead, arguments for long gun ownership often center around traditional hunting. Arguments for pistol ownership center around how crimes involving firearms usually involve illegally imported firearms from the US, and how target shooters are not the cause of gun crime. This is a argument that isn't relevant for most countries, since only Canada and Mexico share a border with the US. 

In Europe, ""target shooting is fun"" *may* work as an argument. It likely depends on the culture of the country in question, and whether they have a longstanding history of sport shooting.

No. DV is entirely different in Spain and a level of radicalism you literally wouldn't believe (when I learned about it, I simply didn't believe it could be true I had to ask 6 lawyers if it was true). In fact its policy contravenes the European Human Rights law (see below) but is still allowed

400 false accusations in Spain a day against men

In case your wonder what this is. In Spain the man (only the man, this law does not apply to women on men or women, or men on men) would AUTOMATICALLY be arrested for 48 hours WITHOUT TRIAL and then goto a judge. The woman would then get 400 euros a month (only women). There are 106 courts ONLY for men. The important thing to note is that arrest WITHOUT trial (i.e. guilty UNTIL innocent) is not the normal police procedure of arresting people, it is based SOLELY on the word of the woman (but not the man) so ""yeah he's covered in blood and I look fine, but officer, he hit me... ok arrest the man for 48 hours no trial"") For obvious reasons its highly weaponised in Spain by women... here is a video of a Spanish woman faking her injury caught on video, the idiot didn't realise she doesnt even need to fake an injury she could have just claimed it (see source at end of post for link)

here is a video of man being sentenced - Orwellian!! (see source at end of post):

So in this Spanish gender law, a woman doing the EXACT same thing to a man (or another woman) would not be a crime (it would apply normal legal process)

PHD on it and how it is against human rights:

They had a policy where if a woman claimed DV in a house, she would have the deeds transferred to her (not wife, I mean ANYONE a girl you live with for 2 weeks... your 30 year old house she has nothing to do with would go to her.... again ONLY to a woman, not a man.... this part of it eventually got removed from the law after a few years)

This isnt niche policy... well over 1,000,000 affected. Also it has made domestic violence actually worse then when policy stared in 2004... which isnt a suprise if you try and solve real issues with idalpgical bullshit dogma, thats what happens

**This BTW you should oppose ALL attempts to gender laws and policies... this is feminist/ SJW end game i.e. Spain what they want, it starts with gendering laws which should be gender neutral... e.g. UK decided to add sex to list of hate crime victims (this is not inconsequential, if a crime e.g. verbal abuse is deemed to be hate crime, it has higher sentence).... surprise surprise, feminists VICIOUSLY opposed this, and said specifically not sex, not women, but MISOGYNY should be added, and SPECIFICALLY men should not be added nor should misandry.... thats their start of trying to create a different legal system so crimes against women are different to the exact same crime against men.**

For example: France was one of the biggest military powers in Europe during that time. His generals didn't want _anything_ to do with invading France but Hitler was stubborn so they went ahead with it... and got lucky. Invading France was _obviously_ one of his biggest accomplishments as a ""military strategist"" but again, as I said, everybody else was against the move and he got lucky.

Towards the end of the second World War, it was obvious that Hitler wasn't an intelligent strategist. The Nazis conducted a pretty solid propaganda campaign against Stalin, Russia and communism; all the while, he was murdering innocent civilians and the world was taking notice to this. Stalin became the less of two evils for the rest of the world by the end of the war. He lost support from all sides... that's not what a good strategist would do.

Also, the invasion of Stalingrad. Stalingrad was _leveled_ to dust and rubble by the Luftwaffe bombing runs and morale was low on the Russian side. So, Hitler said: ""Well, go right in, they're weak and running low on everything."" I don't know what his expectations were but sending German troops into the bitter cold of Stalingrad wasn't exactly the smartest move, especially when you know... Russians were used to the cold and the German troops were on very unfamiliar ground. Not even the best meth they could have cooked up in Berlin could have kept their soldiers from freezing to death. It might have been the single dumbest military move that the Nazis could have come up with. And then, after getting into Stalingrad and starting the house-to-house warfare, they actually let the Russian generals assemble troops in the mountains, let them attack their supply line from two sides, _cutting off their whole supply line into Stalingrad_ and then Hitler left the troops for dead. The intelligence portion of the Nazis was _very weak_ and that hadn't just been in Stalingrad, their intelligence gathering had always been weak.

Also, why didn't he _bomb the RAF_? Instead, he decided to bomb Britain to send a message. He had severely crippled the RAF... so he decided to bomb Britain's cities? Instead of completely destroying the Royal Air Force.

So, sure. You could say that Hitler was a ""very good public speaker"" if you don't think about what was going on in Germany before his rise to power. He was a man who took advantage of a country angry about the Treaty of Versailles, which destabilized their economy due to the $33 billion reparations they had to pay. All he did was take advantage of a country in shambles, using his prowess in being an ""elegant speaker"" and turned it into a mass-murdering machine, focused on his vision to create an ethno-regime for the Aryan race.",True,False,False,,,,0,1606834927,,1606835123,0,{},ge9i0t9,False,t3_k4f6bf,False,False,t1_ge8o4wl,/r/LeopardsAteMyFace/comments/k4f6bf/a_poc_who_has_tweeted_some_racist_things_gets/ge9i0t9/,False,,1618064874,4,True,False,LeopardsAteMyFace,t5_3jp3p,r/LeopardsAteMyFace,public,,0,[],

To, verden har ændret sig. EU, Tyskland, Storbritannien, USA, Australien, Sverige, osv. osv. har alle bevæget sig over i en langt mere Kina-kritisk retning. Hvordan ville det se ud, hvis Danmark nu bevægede sig væk fra dem? Specielt, når vores udenrigsminister har været ude og sige, at han gerne vil hjælpe dem i HongKong?

It's always like that, it ends up affecting the low to middle class instead of the million dollar tax cheats. Hell, the US has been prepping up the EU to go after accidental Americans without considering their circumstances, and when they do, it will be sold as having gone after tax cheats - who've been paying taxes in their home countries their whole lives - when what they've are going to do is getting banks to pin the metaphorical Star of David's on the next vulnerable minority in Europe, which seems to now be those ""Americans"" who don't accept that America is #1 by making a life in other countries. Now, not only Germany can join in on the fun, everyone else can.

The rest of the developed world uses residence based taxation, while the US is only joined by Eritria in its Citizen based taxation. Before that, it was joined by the Philippines, but the Philippines made the transition into the modern world in the 20th century. And let's face it, no one reading this comment is going to give a shit, so I'll just leave a link to what seems to make people give a shit nowadays: Entertainment!

[What it's like as an American abroad with Taxes: Double Taxation](https://youtu.be/4l2RDCx2YnA)

And if you look at who's doing the fighting against this, it gets even dirtier, because there are actually corporate interests fostering fake grassroots movements to get FATCA repealed by parading as and misleading those who would try to unite because they are affected by this.

The US does need to go after wealthy tax cheats, but the ""swamp"" won't let it, 40% don't give a shit for ""fake Americans"", and most of the remaining 60% aren't even aware of the near Jim Crow law state of affairs for taxation of Americans residing overseas. But in contrast to Trump, those Americans haven't paid armies of lawyers to cheat themselves legally out of tax by being constantly in debt, so it's pretty easy PR to go after ""wealthy tax cheats"", defining ""wealthy"" as anyone who could have been afforded a plane ticket after they were born and ""tax cheats"" for paying taxes all of their life, but not the appropriate IRS tax form or the appropriate FinnCERN registration for ""foreign accounts"" of the day to day living accounts the use at the place where they've lived (most of) their life.

Don't get your hopes up. Yogi's pick could be Mumbadevi. 

The city’s earliest recorded names are said to be Kakamuchee and Galajunkja, versions of which are still considered to be in use. However, the city was referred to as Manbai in the Mirat-i-Ahmadi, a historical text on Gujarat dating back to 1507 written in [Persian](http://theculturetrip.com/middle-east/iran/) by Ali Muhammad Khan. In Lendas da Índia or the Legends of India, written in old Portuguese by writer [Gaspar Correia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaspar_Correia), the city was referred to as Bombaim, meaning ‘good bay’. ‘Bombay’ is an anglicized version of the [Portuguese](http://theculturetrip.com/europe/portugal/) name used by the British when they took control of the city in the 17th century. Adding to the confusion, historical records indicate that the city was referred to as Mombayn , Bombay, Bombain , Bombaym, Monbaym, Mombaim, Mombaym, Bambaye, Bombaiim, Bombeye, Boon Bay, and Bon Bahia, among other names at different points in its colonial history!

Regardless, ‘Mumbai’ is said to already have been in use in the 16th century by the local Koli fisher-folk community. It is considered to have been derived from the name of the Koli goddess Mumbadevi, considered to be the city’s patron deity and Aai (mother). And so some Marathi, Konkani, Gujarati, and Kannada speakers had been referring to the city as Mumbai even though it was Bambai to Hindi speakers and the rest of the country, and Bombay in official records.",True,False,False,,,,0,1606837617,,False,0,{},ge9n9nw,False,t3_k3zkpt,False,True,t1_ge8ejpl,/r/mumbai/comments/k3zkpt/up_cm_yogi_adityanath_to_visit_mumbai_on_dec_2_to/ge9n9nw/,False,,1618067404,4,True,False,mumbai,t5_2qp4r,r/mumbai,public,,0,[],

1. Big budget team is a good way to start. When I started I actually jumped into a custom/fictional game.  I don't know that many MLB players so I wouldn't have much of an attachment to any of them anyway, in a custom game I felt more attached to my team that way.
2. As mentioned, a GM/Manager role is good as you have the flexibility to delegate tasks to your staff. I would suggest letting the staff handle the lineup, and the player promotions and demotions, even minor league singings.  Baseball is a complicated beast with all its waiver rules and such. You may want the A.I. to handle that, as you handle the staff, trades, contracts. Then learn all the small details of baseball rules.
3. One feature I recommend is ""Shop player"" it can be a HUGE challenge to trade a player by simply looking over an other teams roster.  The A.I. sometimes are just totally unwilling to trade a player.  If you use the Shop player option, you can specify (like in FM2020) what you're looking for in return, a Vet, A rookie, a specific position...  The game will then throw you a list of players from other teams where a trade is compatible.  Its very quick and easy, occasionally you can even get a great deal from it.
4. My challenge in the game is always self driven or narrative driven, I try to keep my team young and competitive and win championships.  I play a custom game and I'm also playing in commissioner mode.  This allows me to modify plenty of settings, in my game I'm adding more European players and talent, I've created a 12 team premiere league in the UK/France/Germany.  Things like that keep my interest going, so i'm not just focused on my team I like to observe what's happening in the baseball world.

Additional advice : Don't be afraid to turn on commissioner mode, this will allow you to edit many aspects of the game but also look at the raw stats and details of players.  (Or change some if you need)  Its honestly a good way to understand how the game is running.   Like in FM2020 where you can hide players ratings in OOTP you can do the game, but also keep in mind the ratings presented to you are a prediction from your scout.  In commissioner mode you can look at the honest raw numbers of a player which influences his ratings.  This might just help you understand better how the OOTP ratings are done.

&amp;#x200B;

Since you're a FootballManager guy, I played that this past weekend to try and get into that game, I have a good understanding of soccer, played a lot of fifa, played soccer my entire life, but that game seems very intimidating in regards of staff management and roster management.  I'm having a hard time getting into it.  Plus when you click continue I always feel I'm being interrupted with little actions to take. It felt like in 8 hours of playing I only went through 3 friendlies.   If you have some advice on how to get better immersed into FM2020 let  me know.      With that comment, in OOTP check you manager settings you can change the number of notifications that pops up as you play, injuries, trades, events.  Some show up as mail some will stop the simulation and ask you to do something/react.

I've hardly committed to that, it will likely take years to get approved. Especially with Covid.

[],,tnecniv2357,,,,[],,,,text,t2_3j61bbgp,False,False,[],"Om vi pladdrar runt i ölen lite till då - systembolaget har överlag ett större utbud på importerad öl från mindre västeuropeiska, tjeckiska och Amerikanska bryggerier än en gemen dagligvarubutik, ja. På en fri marknad skulle man behöva importera en del av de säsongsvaror som vi kan spontanhandla på systemet, det sätter jag inte emot. Men om det är argumentet för att vi ska ha ett monopol med sina avigsidor, räcker det ur mitt perspektiv inte att sortimentet i butik är måttligt bättre än i dagligvaruhandeln och möjligtvis marginellt bättre än motsvarande köpupplevelse på nät/postorder.

Hade verkligheten varit att systembolaget kunnat överglänsa den fria marknaden med vettiga priser på ett gediget ölutbud från danska, polska, estniska, japanska, ryska, bolivianska, argentinska, australiensiska och sydkoreanska småbryggerier som försöker ge sig in på en hårt exploaterad marknad - då hade jag kunnat hålla med om att det hade varit gynnsamt för oss svenskar som tycker om spännande öl. Men detta är ju inte monopolets egentliga uppdrag.

När vi ändå är inne på ölen och den fria marknaden kontra monopolet, innebär vårt nuvarande system att lokala mikrobryggerier måste komma upp i en högre produktionskapacitet för att kunna leva upp till bolagets krav för att deras öl ska kunna säljas, vilket gör att det finns en högre investeringströskel för att starta mikrobryggeri som kan sälja öl i Sverige. Detta gynnar främst stora aktörer (Carlsberg) som driver småskalig produktion i underbolag, framför små oberoende aktörer. Detta ger en fördel till små utländska aktörer med friare marknad, vilket i sin tur gör att mer nischad öl med fördel produceras utanför Sverige än inom landets gränser.

Det med att peka på monopolets fina sortiment i butik utan att ta hänsyn till övriga faktorer är i min mening som att pissa i byxorna för att hålla benen varma i vinterkylan. Funkar jättebra på kort sikt, men man stinker av piss och efter några minuter fryser man mer än från början då fuktiga byxor leder värme/kyla bättre än torra.

De små discountbutikerna i DK, framförallt Netto, har större rotation på sina varor och fler lokala varor än vad vi är vana vid i svenska butiker. Där går man in om man vet att de har ett bra erbjudande, ska ha något snabbt och billigt (smör, mjölk, bröd, choklad) eller har minsta känsla för spontanitet och improvisation (ofta är det väldigt vettiga råvaror till ett bra pris). Detta gäller även ölen.

Ce urmează e mult text dar o să încerc să scriu cât mai pe scurt.

Dragonii bărboși sunt șopârle de dimensiuni medii aș spune eu, diurne și foarte prietenoase. Sunt pline de personalitate, iar la maturitate sunt majoritar erbivore. Vin din deșertul australian așa că habitatul lor trebuie să fie similar.

În casă se ține :) mai precis în terariu. Al meu e încă puiuț, la 4 luni și 24cm, pe la un an ar trebui să aibe între 40-60cm dar cam jumătate din lungime e coada.

Terariul la un pui poate să fie și 60x45x45cm, dar la un adult o să ai nevoie de ceva mai lung, aș zice unul de cel puțin 90cm. Eu personal vreau să-i fac unul de 120 când va fi mare.

Poți să-l mai scoți din terariu să stea și cu tine, dar are nevoie și de mediul lui acolo.

O să ai nevoie de lampa de căldură, și sub ea un loc unde se poate încălzi, ca o piatră. Temperatura sub lampă e ok la 40°C la adulți, la pui între 40-43°C.

În partea cealaltă a terariului (deoarece ai nevoie de un gradient de căldură) pot să fie între 21-24°C, temperatura camerei obișnuită. Noaptea să ai grijă să nu scadă sub 18. Dacă ai probleme cu temperatura prea mică, nu ține becurile aprinse, ia un încălzitor de ceramică. E ca un bec care dă doar căldură, fără lumină.

O să ai nevoie de becul UVB. E foarte important, fără el șopârla se va îmbolnăvi. Un UVB tub (ca un neon) e mai bun ca unul compact de obicei, trebuie să fie de putere 10.0 oricum. Le găsești pe net sau magazine de animale. Să nu uiți că trebuie schimbate, chiar dacă ele se aprind după 6 luni sau un an (depinde de model, scrie pe cutie) vor rămâne fără raze UVB. Partea bună e că poți să te bronzezi și tu la asemenea bec :))

Becurile se țin aprinse doar ziua, între 10-14h pe zi în funcție de anotimp.

Umiditatea ar trebui să fie foarte scăzută, sub 40%, de aceea un bol cu apă nu prea e recomandat. De cele mai multe ori dragonii nu beau apă stătătoare oricum, ei își iau apa din mâncare.

În terariu o să aibe nevoie și de ascunzători (precum acele pietre goale pe dinăuntru), crengi pe care se cățăra etc. Poți chiar să ai și unele plante vii! (Fasolea e ok de exemplu)

Lăsând terariul la o parte, dragonul va mânca insecte și plante verzi. Insectele vor trebui să fie vii, găsești de cumpărat la magazinele de animale dar îți recomand să iei de la oamenii care vând pe olx, mai ieftin și sunt mai de încredere. Dubia, pallida, orientalis, majoritatea tipurilor de gândăcei sunt ok pentru ei. Dubia sunt cel mai ușor de ținut totuși. Când vine vorba de viermișori, phoenix worms sunt okay, superwoms mai mult ca dulciuri că sunt foarte grași.

Păpădie, rucola, dovlecel sunt plante pe care le pot mânca zilnic. Sunt o grămadă de lucruri pe care le pot mânca, o să-ți las surse la care să te uiți. Să nu le dai avocado sau insecte găsite pe afară (ori prin casă) niciodată.

Când vine vorba de personalitate, dragonii nu mușcă. Doar dacă îi dai mâncare cu mâna s-ar putea să rateze mâncarea, dar nu e nimic grav. Când sunt supărați ei își închid la culoare barba, de aici și numele. Când sunt pui fac dungi pe burtă și pe barbă când sunt supărați.

Însă ține minte că ei își schimbă culoarea și în funcție de temperatură.

Sunt multe de spus și nu știu dacă tu vrei să îți iei de pui sau un adult, dar îți recomand următoare surse:

De asemenea, r/BeardedDragons are și un Discord cu multe informații, dar sunt și ghiduri pe sub

În final o să-ți recomand să-ți iei un mascul dacă îl vrei doar ca animal de casă, pentru că femelele vor depune ouă și fără mascul. Vor fi infertile dar va trebui să ai grijă de ea să nu facă carență de calciu, să aibe unde să le depună, să nu rămână în interiorul ei și mai multe.

Things will develop that make speaking and mentally processing language easier for speakers. Gender is essentially just a way of classifying nouns into categories, which can make it easier in determining their roles in a sentence, for example, in cases where English would only have ""it"" available (so imagine a sentence like ""the dog chased the cat. It had a black tail""; what is ""it"" referring to here? A language with gender might be able to make it clear which animal is being referred to). Our minds like categorisation and metaphor, it makes conceptualising things easier. This is reflected in our language. George Lakoff wrote an good book about this called *Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things* if you're interested.

&gt;when you have a group of mixed genders you use the male form

Keep in mind that the ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" noun classes could literally be called anything. You could call them ""black"" and ""white"" and it would have the same function. It's just because male and female *sex* happens to correlate between the two classes that they are called that in European languages.

Clearly, people from outside America ARE interested in American murder stories otherwise I don't think we'd be having this discussion on this sub. Sure, most people aren't interested in true crime at all. But for those that are, who seek out this sub, hard to avoid that most of the content is going to be from America. That's just the userbase of the website. It's just true that the US exports a lot of media, including true crime media, and a significant amount of media is consumed in English. 

I said in another comment that I absolutely do not think racial and ethnic diversity has anything to do with the disparity in murder rates. Most murders are intra-racial, not inter-racial. Nothing in my above comment implies that I think all germans have the same ethnic makeup. I know they do not. That's why I hate the other comment that implies that Germany being more ""homogeneous"" and the US being more racially diverse is the cause of the homicide disparity. That is obviously untrue. 

My point was about ECONOMIC stratification. If you break down US homicide rates by state, you will see that wealthier states have murder rates that are on par with European countries like Germany or Denmark. States like Louisiana and New Mexico, where extreme poverty is prevalent, have much, much higher homicide rates.

Well, it all depends on whether or not mass storage facilities like those in France work or not.  If it ends up working, then yes, Nuclear is feasible.  If it leaks, or gets blown up, or some other unforseen consequence happens... then no, it will not have been worth it, and might destroy Europe's habitability for thousands of years.

I think fusion power, and researching proper disposal, or even use of nuclear waste are the ways forward.  I don't necessarily think continuing to pump out nuclear waste, which may in time prove to more harmful than global warming itself, is a good idea.

It's a risk.  Global warming has a chance of being solved with carbon capture, and various other technologies.  Nuclear Waste has a chance of being solved as well.  

The worst case scenario would be that in 10 years we discover carbon capture technology that makes reversing global warming possible, and we find out that storing nuclear waste is even more problematic than we previously thought, and that long term safe storage isn't possible, and the current facilities need to be emptied(or god forbid they find out too late, after they've already massively leaked).  It's sort of a coin flip.

The GBE will operate a points-based system, where points are scored for senior and talented young players.

They will be based on: 1) Senior and youth international appearances. 2) Quality of the selling club, based on the league they are in, league position and progression in continental competition. 3) Club appearances, based on domestic league and continental competition minutes.

Players accumulating the requisite amount of points will earn a GBE (Governing Body Endorsement) automatically, while players just below the threshold may be considered for a GBE by an Exceptions Panel.

In the Premier League, the number of overseas U21 players a club can sign will be limited to 3 in the January transfer window and 6 per season moving forwards.

&gt; 
&gt; “Operation Condor pursued many types of political opponents, including congressional representatives, former ministers, human rights advocates (including people in Amnesty International), constitutionalist military officers, peasant leaders, unionists, priests and nuns, professors and students,” says J. Patrice McSherry, professor emerita of political science at Long Island University. “Condor targeted not only the Left, but also the center-left and other democratic sectors that were fighting to demand their rights and make more inclusive the elitist democracies of the era.”
&gt; 
&gt; “First, the aim was to stop terrorism,” one operative from the Department of National Intelligence (DINA), Chile’s feared secret police, explained. “Then possible extremists were targeted, and later those who might be converted into extremists.” Or, as one Argentine general put it: “First we will kill all the subversives; then we will kill their collaborators; then their sympathizers; then those who are indifferent.”
&gt; 
&gt; Though this was supposed to be justified by the dire threat of left-wing violence, it’s hard to take such a threat seriously today. Not only were the Condor governments targeting individuals who were peaceful or unconnected to any revolutionary movements, but those movements had largely been defeated or even given up on armed struggle. As Shlaudeman put it to Henry Kissinger in 1976: “Both terrorists and the peaceful left have failed. This is true even in the minds of studious revolutionaries.” Fernando Lopez has [argued](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Feathers_of_Condor/1uj6DAAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;bsq=fernando%20lopez%20military%20regimes%20grossly%20overstated%20the%20threat%20posed%20by%20the%20revolutionary%20movements&amp;dq=fernando%20lopez%20military%20regimes%20grossly%20overstated%20the%20threat%20posed%20by%20the%20revolutionary%20movements&amp;pg=PR10&amp;printsec=frontcover) that the regimes “grossly overstated the threat posed by the revolutionary movements” so they could go after their real target: the opposition in exile, who drew global sympathy and solidarity, and isolated the Condor governments internationally.
&gt; 
&gt; [Image](https://images.jacobinmag.com/2016/10/17230901/letelier1-1.jpg)Orlando Letelier, killed by a car bomb in Washington, DC, in 1976. (The Transnational Institute)Their plans weren’t confined to the continent. Twelve of the victims of cross-border operations came from countries outside of the region, including the UK, Italy, France, and the United States, while some of the most high-profile targets were assassinated in European countries, making Condor not just a transnational operation, but a global one. As exiled left-wing and moderate opponents of Pinochet’s dictatorship planned to campaign for diplomatic isolation of the country, he plotted to take them out.
&gt; 
&gt; Agents of DINA planned attacks in Portugal and France, and tried repeatedly to kill Carlos Altamirano, general secretary of the Socialist Party of Chile: once in Mexico, when they showed up too late; several times in Paris, when they were foiled by French intelligence; and once in Madrid, where the attempt failed. Bernardo Leighton, the founder of Chile’s Christian Democrat Party, may not have been a radical — he opposed much of Allende’s program — but he was guilty of meeting with Socialist leaders to form an opposition front of exiles against the regime. He survived a gunshot to the back of the head in Rome, but was left with permanent brain damage, ending his opposition activities.
&gt; 
&gt; While Pinochet took a leading role, the targets weren’t just Chilean. Scotland Yard prevented the assassination of Uruguayan senator Wilson Ferreira Aldunate in London, while then-representative Edward Koch, later to become mayor of New York City, was warned by then-CIA director George H. W. Bush that there was a threat on his life, thanks to his successful amendment to end US military aid to Uruguay. In Buenos Aires, two Uruguayan legislators and two activists were kidnapped in the early morning and later found with shots to the head in a car left under a bridge. Meanwhile, as journalist John Dinges has pointed out, a slew of seemingly natural deaths in a few short years of opponents in exile of the continent’s various dictatorships raises further suspicions.
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps the most famous victim of Condor was [Orlando Letelier](https://jacobinmag.com/2016/09/orlando-letelier-pinochet-nixon-kissinger), Allende’s former ambassador to the United States. After being detained and tortured by the regime following the coup, diplomatic pressure allowed Letelier to escape and eventually return to Washington, DC, where he soon became one of the most visible and influential members of Chile’s opposition to exile. Set up in the heart of American power and hobnobbing with US officials and their families, Letelier led a successful legislative campaign to ban US arms sales to Chile, lobbied against a $63 million investment by a Dutch company into the country, and fiercely criticized Pinochet’s free-market economic reforms.
&gt; 
&gt; All of it made him a marked man. In 1976, two DINA agents entered the United States on passports from Paraguay, a fellow Condor member, and with the help of two exiled Cuban anti-communists, rigged a bomb to Letelier’s car that detonated right on DC’s Embassy Row, killing him and one of his two American passengers. Until September 11, 2001, it would remain the worst act of foreign terrorism on US soil.
&gt; 
&gt;   For years, the official story was that the US government learned about Condor roughly around the same time as everyone else, in 1976. In fact, through declassifications, firsthand testimony, and the work of historians, we now know that this program of state terror had been sanctioned, facilitated, and encouraged by the US government.
&gt; 
&gt; Contrary to its denials at the time, a CIA report produced for Congress in 2000 would admit that “within a year after the [1973 Chilean] coup, the CIA and other US government agencies were aware of bilateral cooperation among regional intelligence services to track the activities of and, in at least a few cases, kill political opponents” — a “precursor” to Condor. Consider, too, that Manuel Contreras, the ruthless DINA chief knee-deep in Condor, was a (at one point, paid) [CIA asset](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/news/20000919/01-16.htm) from 1974 to 1977, despite an internal 1975 report [finding him](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/news/20000919/01-17.htm) “the principal obstacle to a reasonable human rights policy within the junta.”
&gt; 
&gt; For decades, speculation has abounded about just how unintentionally oblivious segments of the US government really were to the Letelier operation specifically. Despite being [repeatedly alerted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1980/06/29/the-unresolved-questions-in-the-letelier-case/f70e1f2a-159f-492d-9a2a-a1f74d6d3430/) to the DINA agents’ attempts to enter the United States, and its suspicious nature, the CIA did nothing. A mere five days before they killed Letelier, Kissinger [backpedaled an order](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB514/docs/Doc%2005%20-%2091cd.pdf) for US ambassadors in a handful of the Condor countries to express the US government’s “deep concerns” over the reported plans of overseas assassination. Earlier that year, Pinochet had [personally complained](http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB212/19760608%20US-Chilean%20Relations.pdf) to Kissinger about Letelier’s activities, in a conversation in which Kissinger assured the dictator that “we are sympathetic with what you are trying to do.”
&gt; 
&gt; But worse, evidence uncovered by figures like McSherry and Dinges suggest the US government wasn’t just aware of the crimes of Condor, but directly involved in them.
&gt; 
&gt; Archival documents show the CIA, FBI, and even US embassies providing intelligence and names of suspects to the Condor governments, with both hemispheres looking into suspects on their home turf at the other’s behest. That included Fuentes, the results of whose interrogation (including the names he gave up) the US embassy in Buenos Aires relayed to Chilean police. Contreras himself later insisted, in court and to reporters, that the CIA had been involved in both the murder of Letelier and Carlos Prats, the former Chilean general blown up in Argentina a year before Condor’s founding, and that he had given the FBI documents proving his claims in 2000.

It was my mistake for not inquiring more about him - she seldom mentioned him, but when we first were together, he was trying to contact her and she blocked him. She admitted that she unblocked him and began reacting to his ig stories 4 months or so before the breakup (we were together just over a year), but in the month or two prior to the break up, had began talking to him a lot - mainly about relationships and such.

I reckon it was because I was bogged down with two jobs and did not skype with her as much in the last month - i was blind to see that she was retracting and assumed there was nothing wrong (we were about to live together for 2 months).

The key person of Dominion Voting are all related to The Carlyle Group. The Carlyle Group is an American multinational private equity, alternative asset management and financial services corporation, with more than $203 billion in assets under management.

His deputy is James Baker III, who was US Secretary of State under George Bush senior. The financial assets of the Saudi Binladen Corporation (SBC) are also managed by the Carlyle Group.

Vreau sa spun din prima ca nu stiu cat de calificat sunt eu sa dau sfaturi insa voi incerca sa-ti dau macar cateva idei.

In primul rand daca te intereseaza partea de backend presupun ca as putea veni si eu cu cateva idei din moment ce cochetez si eu cu domeniul asta. La partea de backend depinde mult unde vrei sa lucrezi. Eu personal am inceput cu PHP si apoi am continuat cu un framework de PHP numit Laravel (un fel de colectie de coduri scrise in PHP care te ajuta sa dezvolti mai rapid un website). Acum PHP e usor de invatat si gasesti mult continut pentru el insa nu stiu daca e cea mai interesanta alegere pentru angajare. Mai degraba ar fi pentru ceva freelance work as zice. Dar ca limbaje de referinta peste care sa te uiti pentru backend ar fi, Java daca vrei sa lucrezi in corporatii mari, NodeJS este iar o alegere interesanta, Python chiar desi este ceva mai restrans ca popularitate insa are doua framework-uri pentru partea de backend (Django si Flask). Din toate astea probabil Java iti va oferi cele mai multe variante de angajare. Ca idee, odata ce inveti cum sa faci o chestie intr-un limbaj, o sa iti fie foarte usor sa sari in alt limbaj si sa faci fix aceeasi operatiune, ideile sunt mai greu de invatat de principiu.

Daca vrei sa te angajezi iti recomand si o facultate. Pe langa ca iti ofera ghidare, te pune si sa incerci mai multe chestii, poate cine stie, mai descoperi ceva ce iti place. In plus reprezinta un avantaj atunci cand te angajezi mai ales la inceput. Singura chestie ar fi, daca nu vrei niciodata sa te angajezi presupun ca ai putea sa dai skip la facultate. Dar doar cu conditia sa fii 100% convins ca viitorul tau nu e ca angajat si ca freelancer sau antreprenor in domeniu. Nu ca nu te-ai putea angaja si fara facultate, insa iti va fi mai greu. Sau daca esti bun nu neaparat mai greu, dar vei da inca un motiv angajatorului sa te plateasca mai putin si nu cred ca vrei sa lucrezi la fel de mult ca un coleg cu facultate dar sa iei mai putini bani la final de luna.

Cat despre ce se face la facultate, eu sunt la AC anul 3, si as zice ca nu faci chiar atat de multa fizica si mate cat sa fie problema. Adica da, o sa ai materii mai ales in primul an si jumtate, dupa se vor mai rari. Dar daca chiar vrei sa faci o facultate sunt sigur ca vei reusi sa treci cu putina chinuiala si de materiile alea. Acum eu sunt la politehnica prin urmare se va face mai multa mate si fizica decat spre exemplu la info. Deci daca mergi acolo ar trebui sa ai sa zic 90% din materii orientate mai degraba spre partea de info. De notat ca am zis partea de info si nu partea de backend, adica nu o sa legi tu fire pe placute poate, dar asta nu inseamna ca vei face fix ce iti place tie, vei face si multe chestii care nu iti vor trezi interesul (asta apare la absolut orice facultate). Insa vreau sa iti zic sa nu iti fie rusine de ce facultate alegi. Sau sa te iei dupa alti oameni care zic vai facultatea aia e naspa nu merge acolo. Mergi unde crezi tu ca iti va placea. Ti-o spun eu care nu neaparat ca am fost influentat de altii sa merg la AC insa nu as fi vrut sa nu intru la AC ca ma gandeam ca daca nu intru aici inseamna ca nu sunt suficient de inteligent. Ulterior abia am descoperit ca facultatea la care mergi nu e neaparat un indicator pentru cat de inteligent esti.

Daca vrei sa mergi in SUA iti recomand totusi sa te orientezi pentru o universitate acolo. Este scump intradevar, e mai complicat si asa mai departe dar e mai bine sa te scolarizeze mediul in care vrei sa activezi. Nu ca nu ai putea sa te angajezi in SUA venind din Romania insa presupun ca da mai bine sa termini ceva de acolo decat sa termini ceva din Romania. Si cred sincer ca decat sa faci o facultate in Romania si dupa sa iti cauti de lucru acolo mai bine incepi sa lucrezi tu, sa iti faci proiecte personale si sa incerci asa sa gasesti un job in America decat sa le arati alora ca ai terminat ceva facultate de care ei nu au auzit in viata lor (asta e parerea mea nu am lucrat niciodata in America, nu cunosc piata muncii acolo si nu sunt in masura sa dau sfaturi in legatura cu asta)

La final vreau sa iti recomand canalul meu de YouTube unde gasesti cateva clipuri despre cum e facultatea in romania, mai exact AC Iasi, poate iti ofera niste idei:

I think in this case the interviewer comes out and uses the instance in Poland to then ask if the Pinkertons are performing similar tasks here in the US.

In general once they have been observed doing boss/company bidding abroad questions are immediately going to pop up about their activities in the states. Thinking on this track it becomes very easy to tie it back into what the group is most famous for: squashing labor organizing during a time when Amazon is facing increasing scrutiny over its labor practices.

- Think about what aspects of drug policy you're interested in working on. Decriminalising simple possession? Safer consumption centres? Regulation  of psychedelics? Cannabis markets? Access to essential medicines in developing countries? The human rights of affected populations? They're all relevant in drug policy, but all very different. Understanding drug policy and what aspects of it you want to influence are more important (at least initially) than legal knowledge. It will also help you identify those organisations that you are interested in working for or with. Drug policy is a broad church; we tend to think of drug policy reformers as liberal - it isn't always the case, and you don't want to end up working for an organisation that isn't aligned with your views
- Don't necessarily chuck the day job just yet. There aren't that many neat and tidy 'drug policy lawyer' jobs out there. Most people working in the field are other things as well, or first - academic lawyers, NGO service providers and so on. Unless you *really* want away from corporate law, consider dipping your toe first - see if you can volunteer some CSR days to work on drug policy issues. This will also help you see what kind of work is going on in the field. In terms of volunteering, as others have said - if you're in the US, DPA is a good place to start your investigations
- Think also about what kind of work you want to do. Drug policy reform tends to be advocacy in the broad sense - legal work is part of it, but so is managing messaging, understanding stakeholders and a million other things. Think lobbying, more than the representation of clients in court, if that makes sense. Strategic litigation is where it gets adversarial as opposed to advisory - there are a couple of organisations in North America doing this type of stuff - taking cases, filing amicus briefs and so on. ACLU also do some work in the area
- Like others said, if you can get to one of the big conferences post-pandemic, they're great networking events - you'd get to meet loads of people, etc.

Run G28 to auto home, and then run G29 to ABL.  When it's done with ABL, it will spit out a small grid of numbers.  Take those, and paste them into the text area on http://lokspace.eu/3d-printer-auto-bed-leveling-mesh-visualizer/. 

You'll notice that the sample data on that visualizer has 12 columns and 12 rows (meaning that the example is sampling 144 plot points).  The CR-6 SE only does 16 by default, so your mesh data will be a lot smaller (4 columns and rows).  Just paste it in, then click Visualize.

It's easy to see where 0,0 is, and since that's the front-left of your printer, you'll be able to see where the mesh data from the ABL shows dips and rises.  Remember that these are (or should be) sub-millimeter distances.  .1mm isn't going to be a huge deal, but it's still nice to get it completely level.  

At this point, you're just following the instructions over on [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CR6/comments/j21de3/leveling_issues_solved_finally/).  What happens is that when you run ABL and grab the mesh data, it's showing you that it's off.  If the screws under the glass plate are snug, and the eccentric nuts are tight enough that the bed doesn't move when touched by the nozzle, then the main thing to check is going to be that x-gantry to make sure it's as square to the bed as possible.  That's what the mesh data is going to tell you: with rises and dips, either the gantry is off or the bed isn't perfectly level (and has some small differences in smoothness).

So when you adjust the z-screws, you're attempting to get it flat.  Get it flat, and if you STILL have issues, then it's likely your bed has some warpage in it, which shouldn't be a huge deal as that's the exact thing ABL is going to deal with for you.  

Just be sure you're not throwing the x-gantry out of whack by having the z-screws off-kilter, because then you'll have issues when it tries to raise along Z (it'll get hung up and make crunchy noises).",True,False,False,,,,0,1606854403,,1606854627,0,{},geamtit,False,t3_k4lprx,False,True,t1_ge9v0h0,/r/CR6/comments/k4lprx/auto_bed_leveling_does_nothing/geamtit/,False,,1618084209,2,False,False,CR6,t5_2mt9ul,r/CR6,public,,0,[],

You don't need perfect adoption to make a major impact, particularly when we're going to be supply-constrained on the vaccine next year anyways.

Then explain to me why the same ultra-wealthy families that partook in the Bolshevik Revolution still hold an Oligarchy over entire industries in that country? 

&gt; In history, communist revolutions have always killed or exiled all of the old elites, even if they then imposed a totalitarian dictatorship after that with new elites. 

And historically, the “old elites” who supported the revolution and facilitated the transition of power have largely grown in power, wealth, and status as a result. Look at China - the same families that have held wealth in that country since the Qing dynasty are now some of the most prominent and wealthy members of the CCP because they partook in the revolution. 

&gt; Certainly currently leftist movements are not friendly to billionaires having billions or the 1% like this CEO. 

Yes they are - why do you think they’re supported by many of the ultra-wealthy? “We’ll protect you because you’re one of the good ones” is the ultimate position for someone looking for unfettered control and zero competition. 

&gt; And democratic socialist countries in Europe have much higher taxes on the wealthy and lower inequality (see GINI ratios or Capital in the 21st century). 

The US has one of the most progressive tax systems in the world so.. no, not really. 

&gt; And if you look at socialism in theory there isn't even capital to own privately.

Right, because “the people” (I.e the government) own it all

&gt;  
&gt;Fears that the finance powerhouse that emerged from Margaret Thatcher’s 1986 deregulation -- known as the Big Bang -- will gradually be dismantled have deepened with a recent flurry of announcements about some business heading to the European Union as Britain enters the last month of the Brexit transition period without a financial-services deal in sight.  
&gt;  
&gt;The latest shift came Monday at 8 a.m., when London Stock Exchange Group Plc’s stock trading platform Turquoise Europe went live in Amsterdam. It joins other trading venues like Cboe Europe and Aquis Exchange Plc setting up shop on the continent as part of their no-deal Brexit plans, a contrast with the late 1980s, which ushered in a period where London became the place to be for equities trading.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The City of London has been thrown to the lions,” said Alasdair Haynes, chief executive officer at Aquis, adding that the U.K. could lose even more stock trading than it expects if giant U.S. asset managers like BlackRock Inc. decide to trade in Paris and Amsterdam.  
&gt;  
&gt;Last week, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said it had applied to French regulators to open its SIGMA X Europe stock platform in Paris from Jan 4. Goldman partner Elizabeth Martin said that she expects most of the 8.6 billion euros ($10 billion) a day in London-based European share trading to shift to the bloc.  
&gt;  
&gt;Europe Calling London venues currently have a 30% share of trading in European stocks  
&gt;  
&gt;Source: Cboe Global Markets  
&gt;  
&gt;Aquis has already established a platform in the French capital. It went live with more than 1,700 European shares earlier this month. Other trading venues like Liquidnet have outposts in Dublin to ensure they can service clients.  
&gt;  
&gt;“We are expecting a big bang on Jan. 4,” said David Howson president of Cboe Europe, the largest of London’s stock trading platforms, which opened its own venue in the Dutch capital last year. “The industry has never had to move this much flow overnight.”  
&gt;  
&gt;It’s not just stock dealing that’s shifting. Brussels disappointed London swap traders last week when its markets regulator said that derivatives need to change hands on EU-based platforms from January. That means trillions of dollars of trades are at risk of being transacted outside of the U.K.  
&gt;  
&gt;Land Grab The bloc has already made a land grab for London’s euro swaps clearing business, urging its banks to accelerate a shift to Europe. Deutsche Boerse AG’s Eurex Clearing has built up a 19% share of the business over recent years although it is dwarfed by London’s market share.  
&gt;  
&gt;In recent weeks, Goldman and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. have indicated that between them more than 300 staff will move to continental cities. Goldman is shifting as much as $60 billion in assets to Frankfurt, while JPMorgan is moving about $230 billion to the German city.  
&gt;  
&gt;Consultancy EY said in a new report Monday that only 10% of big financial services firms are planning to establish or expand operations in the U.K. in the coming year, discouraged by the uncertainties of Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic. That’s down from 45% in April.  
&gt;  
&gt;Foreign Investment in U.K. Finance Set to Drop on Covid, Brexit  
&gt;  
&gt;EY said in a report last month that the 7,500 roles and 1.2 trillion pounds ($1.6 trillion) in assets that have moved already may just be the beginning. It expects further shifts in personnel and assets once the U.K.’s transition period officially ends.  
&gt;  
&gt;That bodes ill for the U.K., where finance employs more than one million people, makes up about 7% of the economy and accounts for more than a 10th of all tax revenue. Despite that, the industry has garnered little of the attention bestowed on fishing, which makes up just 0.1% of the U.K. economy, in the protracted Brexit negotiations.  
&gt;  
&gt;“There is a sense of frustration” that the City is being left behind by the government in key Brexit talks, Lord Mayor of London William Russell said in an interview Monday. “It is disappointing.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Talent Pool To be sure, London’s long-standing advantages of the English language and legal system and a deep talent pool mean it won’t be overtaken anytime soon. And a last-minute agreement with the EU on financial services could still happen.  
&gt;  
&gt;The LSE said it would call off its plan for Turquoise Europe if the European Union declared that Britain can host trading services for EU shares, part of a process known as equivalence. Such an agreement remains a possibility.  
&gt;  
&gt;How ‘Equivalence’ Holds Key to Post-Brexit Banking: QuickTake  
&gt;  
&gt;But time is running out. And without an agreement London’s status as Europe’s financial hub will no longer be in its hands.

    A Struggle for Identity in a Forgotten Corner of Europe
Amid the ghosts of the past empires, residents of Gagauzia fight poverty and a loss of tradition to maintain their culture.

THE QUESTION OF independence has hung over the Moldovan region of Gagauzia for decades. Though its people are desperately poor and rely on agriculture to survive, they cherish their language and culture deeply. Their lives are governed by the land but their hearts are governed by a yearning for identity.

The little-known region is small, with just three towns and a population of 160,000, and was formed out of a 19th century rivalry between the Ottoman and Russian empires. The flat, bucolic landscape comes alive in spring and summer but in winter, the people retreat into hibernation. Pebrel witnessed how drastically the arc and rhythm of their lives changed as the seasons drifted. “It is a harsh winter,” he says. “It gets down to minus 10 or 15 degrees-celsius. Nobody is on the streets. They stay at home and wait for spring to arrive so they can start working in the fields again.”

Pebrel’s intention for the project was to try and understand the Gagauzian identity. The Gagauz are a unique blend of ethnically Turkic and Christian Orthodox, though religion is “not their driving force”. Their food has traces of Turkish influence and there are hints of Balkan style in the way they dress but it is their language - which originates from the Oghuz branch of the Turkic family - that is the remaining, distinguishing ingredient. To this day, very few Gagauzs speak Moldovan, choosing instead to speak Gagauzian or Russian.

European leaders are on record saying that their days of following America's lead are over regardless of who won in 2020.  The damage to USA's standing in the world is enduring, and the above explains why.

I do not understand how those who hoped to ""make America great again"" (which I've always assumed to harken back to the post-WWII days) can see that goal as being compatible with America abandoning its place as a primary actor on the world stage, breaking multiple treaties with allied powers, and allowing fascist powers like Russia and China to step in and increase their roles as global leaders. 

What was it that made America great, if not being a trusted champion for Democracy on the world stage--which very much included things like providing supplies to aid Stalin on the western front, sending critical support to England in stopping the Nazi's at the English Channel and then getting massively involved on the eastern front to defeat fascist Germany, and forming the UN to halt further fascist aggression?
