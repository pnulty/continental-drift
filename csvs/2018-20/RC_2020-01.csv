&gt; none of those countries are even governed by Kurds, nor are those countries governing for Kurds.

I was only using the Kurdish people as an example of the consequences of the Sykes-Picot Treaty from the 1910's and 20's. The treaty is the post-WWI precursor, along with the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, towards drawing the boundaries we see today in the Middle East. The British and French Empires quite literally did not have any Middle Eastern influence/correspondence/voting on the Sykes-Picot Treaty. Honestly, by the end of WWI, the British and French Empires had actually allowed Russian and Italian imperial interests to be represented, recognized, and respected as well. Not a single Middle Eastern interest, imperial or not, was ever represented during these treaty agreements between European empires.

If Kurdish people were actually represented during the treaties, then it could be argued that they were not recognized with respect (for example, they were gerrymandered). That's not the case tho -- they weren't even represented from the very beginning. Whatever consequent states arise, like Iraq/Iran/Turkey/Syria, will inevitably arise due to European imperial interests, not out of the interests of the indigenous masses (remember, Kurdish people aren't the only ones neglected by the treaties). I think the bottom section of the Wiki page I linked on Sykes-Picot Treaties, with the section title of [The Agreement in Practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes‚ÄìPicot_Agreement#The_Agreement_in_practice), talks about the various borders and their associated state governments.

The Earth? No. Europe, which is a tiny corner of the planet? Sure.

&gt; Since its origins, the earth has experienced periods significantly warmer than the modern world -- some epochs have been even hotter than the most extreme predictions of global warming -- and times much colder than today. Today's cool temperatures are well below average for the globe in its more than four billion year history.[21] During one of the warmest such eras the dinosaurs roamed the earth and a rich ecological world flourished.

How do you know this? Climate scientists did the research. The same scientists who tell you there's a problem now.

&gt; Studies of climate history show as was mentioned above that sharp changes in temperatures over brief periods of time have occurred frequently

How brief?

&gt; without setting into motion any disastrous feedback systems that would lead either to a runaway heating that would cook the earth or a freezing that would eliminate all life.

Nobody is arguing that runaway warming is going to happen.

&gt;In addition, carbon dioxide levels have varied greatly. Ice core data exhibit fluctuating levels of CO2 that do not correspond to temperature changes.

They do, actually, when you take all other known factors into account.

The main attraction of this event was an item called the bloodhound heirloom that cost $40.

The reasoning for this stupid pricing model was even more of a shitshow, with devs insulting players, calling them entitled and freeloaders. Eventually, Respawn apologized for the behavior and made some changes to the event. Unfortunately, in a way they made it worse: people could buy the exact skins they wanted for $18, basically double that of the loot crate.

Not to mention the whole Battlefront II controversy that started the campaign against loot boxes within different parliaments across Europe and more recently the U.S. 

The funniest part is that in one hearing, a representative from E.A referred to loot boxes as....SURPRISE MECHANICS, comparing the mechanic to that of a Kindle egg.

Syria has little to no oil reserves of their own. What they have is a Russian natural gas pipeline to Europe.

That being said  since the dissolution of the Warsaw pact, NATO should have been straight up abolished and tremendous amounts of bloodshed would have been avoided. This  I agree on.

So 1hz the screen would refresh 1 time per second (which would look terrible).  Films are usually 24hz (or 24 frames per second).  50hz the screen refreshes 50 times a second.

Way more info than you need below:

Original analog TV in the US was usually 30hz.  Europe was usually 25hz.  Europe and US had different TV refresh rates because the systems were based on the power distribution in those areas.  In the US the electrical grid runs at 60hz, so matching that timing for analog TV made sense.  Europe used a power frequency of 50hz, so they matched that.

But wait, you may ask, US power is 60hz but they were 30hz for refresh rate, that doesn't match?  You are right it doesn't match for frame rate.  Old analog TV was interlaced because CRT's couldn't refresh a full screen fast enough so they could only do half the display at once (so lines 1,3,5,7... then lines 2,4,6,8...).  Each half a frame is called a field.  So:

2 Fields = 1 Frame

or 

60 fields per second = 30 frames per second

Fields were what was actually matched to the the electrical grid for timing. So 60hz power = 60 fields per second = 30 full frames per second.

As technology advanced and HD was developed and CRT's were replaced, progressive formats became more standard.  Progressive meaning the screen renders the lines as you would expect (1,2,3,4,5...). So in the US 60hz refresh rates since they had 60hz fields in the past so 60hz stayed.  In Europe 50hz is more common because of its history.  Both work fine and TV's these days can do either.  So you really won't have issues.

(If you really want your mind blown, 60hz is not actually the refresh rates, because when TV moved from B/W to color they had to tweak things, so for broadcast standards while we say 60hz, it's actually 59.94.  When we moved to HD that 59.94 stayed as well.)",True,False,False,,,0,1577845735,,False,0,{},fcoz9xw,False,t3_eibm8q,False,True,t3_eibm8q,/r/appletv/comments/eibm8q/any_harm_in_setting_atv_to_50hz/fcoz9xw/,False,,1586456624,3,True,False,appletv,t5_2s3df,r/appletv,public,1,[],

&gt;**Rumors and concerns about aspartame causing a number of health problems, including cancer, have been around for many years.** **Some of the concerns about cancer stem from the results of studies in rats published by a group of Italian researchers, which suggested aspartame might increase the risk of some blood-related cancers (leukemias and lymphomas). However, later reviews of the data from these studies have called these results into question. The results of epidemiologic studies (studies of groups of people) of possible links between aspartame and cancer (including blood-related cancers) have not been consistent.**

&gt;In general, the American Cancer Society does not determine if something causes cancer (that is, if it is a carcinogen), but we do look to other respected organizations for help with this. Based on current research, some of these organizations have made the following determinations:

&gt;The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has concluded that ‚Äúthe use of aspartame as a general purpose sweetener‚Ä¶ is safe.‚Äù
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has stated, ‚ÄúStudies do not suggest an increased risk associated with aspartame consumption for‚Ä¶ leukaemia, brain tumours or a variety of cancers, including brain, lymphatic and haematopoietic (blood) cancers.‚Äù
Though research into a possible link between aspartame and cancer continues, these agencies agree that studies done so far have not found such a link.

I can't recall the source offhand, but one of the largest international communist organizations at the time,  identified fascism as an enemy of socialism back in the 1920s. The Soviets would've been aware of this. So the Soviets teaming up with fascism to start an imperialist war of aggression, particularly when socialist political economy doesn't depend on imperialism to function ‚Äì it doesn't make sense. 

The Soviets didn't invade Poland; nor did they annex or partition it with Nazi Germany. The Red Army entered into what was then a legally non-existent State (the Polish government fled to Roumania two weeks earlier), and the Supreme Commander of the Polish military ordered his troops not to attack the incoming Red Army. Therefore, the Soviets weren't a belligerent. The Soviets only advanced up to the territory that was illegally seized from Belarus and Ukraine in the 1919-21 Soviet-Polish war. That occupied land was later rightfully returned to the Ukrainian and Belarusian SSRs. 

The Soviet ""occupation"" of Poland basically saved Poland as a State and stopped the Nazis from massacring the Poles and Jews (as what happened in Lw√≥w), because the Eastern half was safely under Soviet guard. After the war, Poland was rebuilt as an independent State (not an Soviet Socialist Republic) out of Soviet kindness. Remember also that Poland was allowed to leave the Warsaw Pact and the Eastern bloc when the counter-revolutions of 1989 ‚Äì 91 happened. If the Soviets were so ""repressive"", both Yugoslavia and Poland would've been kept under the Soviet belt. They weren't, even when the Soviet military-political apparatus was at its most powerful. 

Molotov-Ribbentrop pact was neither a military alliance nor a collaboration with Nazi Germany. Poland had a non-aggression pact with Hitler too (signed in 1938), and it eagerly seized land from Czechoslovakia and shared logistics with the invading German army. In contrast, there is no discussion among the German General Staff of Soviet participation in the partition or annexation of Poland. The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact defined respective German and Soviet spheres of influence in Europe, with the Curzon line or Poland's eastern border defined as being within the Soviet sphere. ""Spheres of influence"" were a recognized concept in diplomacy and international law well before World War II, and aren't equal to annexation or partition, which is what the Munich Agreement of 1938 that partitioned Czechoslovakia was. 

The public, Western, ""academic"" ""historical"" narrative is that the Allies ""caved in"" to Hitler's demands. The truth is that the Allies (the imperialist-capitalist countries of Britain, France, and the United States) were turning a blind eye to Nazi German aggression with the implicit understanding that the Nazis would eventually turn their aggression East toward their mutual enemy, the Soviet Union. 

The Soviets offered an anti-fascist alliance with the West, one week before the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. The Allies purposely dragged their feet on the proposal and it went nowhere. The M-R pact was a last ditch effort of Soviet diplomacy to delay war and buy time for Soviet preparations for eventual war against Nazi Germany, not a collaboration to partition Poland. 

The M-R pact accomplished several things: 

* Made certain that Nazi Germany was seen as the aggressor;
* bought time for the Soviet military to prepare for war against Germany;
* prevented the Allies from allying with Nazi Germany *against* the Soviet Union, had the USSR decided to prematurely fight a war against Nazi Germany all alone. 
* created a buffer zone between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union,
effectively saving the eastern half of Poland from Nazi destruction. 

The Allies never fought a battle in Poland. It was the Soviets who liberated Auschwitz. [Western governments had knowledge of some scale of genocide for at least two years prior to the camps' liberation, but did little to stop the slaughter.](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/world-history/holocaust-allied-forces-knew-before-concentration-camp-discovery-us-uk-soviets-secret-documents-a7688036.html)

This is the true history of World War II, not taught in the Western education system or discussed in ""academia"" because it violates the anti-communist presuppositions of the discourse.

However, one community in particular marks the new year in a very different way from the rest. 

The Fae community of New Zealand --a transhumanist subculture that evolved from the cosplay fandom-- mark the passing of seasons with a continuous 'Faerie Procession' across the largely wilderness environments of the South Island where they established their main colony. (chosen for its appearance in many fantasy themed films) It is the centerpiece of their cultural and social activity. Each Spring a Faerie king and queen (or sometimes two of each...) are democratically elected to symbolically lead the procession. They may be from either of the two chief sub-groups of their society; the Seelie and Unseelie Courts. (the actual election process is rather elaborate, and deliberately so because the role is symbolic and so the whole thing something of a game) The primary stops along the procession coincide with the months of the alternating solstices and equinoxes --March, June, September, December-- but since they are located below the Equator, the seasons are reversed. Thus they choose to end the year with the June Winter solstice and start the new year --and new procession-- on the September Spring equinox. On the months in-between the procession disperses and plans are drawn up for the new year. 

Each of the 'courts' is represented by a 'pavilion' structure whose architecture is designed to thematically compliment the seasonal atmosphere. Being transhumanists of the 'Naturist' sort, the Fae employ a lot of augmentations which allow them to comfortably tolerate the outdoor environment without the need of the usual shelter. So most of the visible architecture that they employ is based on open structures with mostly social/symbolic function. Thus these pavilions typically consist of an open structure ringed by columns, with or without a roof. Other architecture tends to be hidden underground so as to not impact the aesthetic of the natural habitat. (with the exception of The Creche where couples wanting children go to raise them --which is relatively rare in their polyamorous society) Each encampment stays in place for the month of the solstice/equinox with the flanking months in build-up/knockdown/and travel with shorter stays at other encampments. The community casually drops in and out of the events of the procession at their leisure, the chief congregations on the key solstice/equinox ritual events. 

The Spring Court is arrayed at the base of a preternaturally large tree in a dense forest which provides the 'roof' for the assorted pavilions around its base. A main amphitheatre-like space dominates the other structures, all with a common Art Nouveau-inspired aesthetic. It also features an elaborate complex of structures in its branches and deep among its roots and hosts one of the primary nexuses of the community's generally hidden technical infrastructure. This is the favorite spot for the Seelie Court with the rituals ushering in the new year and the coronation of the new procession nobles held here.

The Summer Court is set inside a large round grassy hill rather like a tumulus overlooking the shore which appears as if its crest has been sliced through and lofted on a series thick columbs. A series of step terraces descend to a sunken inner floor with a large domed ceiling. It is surrounded by a number of other smaller pavilions and small dense copses of trees set in a rolling hillside descending to the shore where various open beaches and sheltered coves can be found. 

The Autumn Court is crafted to look like the stone ruins of an abandoned Gothic cathedral set in a vast graveyard overtaken by forest. It is surrounded by a variety of open pavilions, stone circles, tombs, mausoleums, and caves all deliberately crafted to be a bit creepy-looking. Unsurprisingly, this is the favorite area for the members of Unseelie Court. It is here that a symbolic ritual slaying of the nobles takes place at the end of the season where they are killed either by 'treachery' or in 'combat'. Typically, if both the nobles are of the same court, their reign ends in combat as the opposing court seeks to take over the area in mock battle. If they are of mixed courts their reign ends in treachery with a mock assassination. The two courts routinely engage in various ritualized mock battles, mostly in Summer and Autumn, said to be inspired by the 20th century's Society for Creative Anachronism, and many aspire to cultivating extensive ancient warfare and martial arts skills, albeit with non-lethal weapons and techniques. 

The Winter Court is set on another, rocky, hill topped with a stone circle and overlooking a rugged coastal area, often subject to stormy weather. Here a large wooden longhouse is crafted (from mock lumber) in a style that mixes Norse and Maori aesthetic themes. It is usually accompanied by a number of other yurt-like structures. Here the symbolically 'dead' nobles preside over the end-of-year rituals and are honored at the end of the season with a mock funeral. The members of the procession pay their final respects to the nobles and make final goodbyes to others before departing the longhouse and dispersing back to other areas. As a last act those assembled dismantle the longhouse to create a huge bonfire with the official end of the procession marked by the burning of the noble's thrones. 

There is an additional Yule Village setup during the Summer season which is intended for those who wish to celebrate the traditional European holiday seasons and new years. It is an elaborate construction created in a sheltered mountain valley which, by means kept secret, is usually supplied with snow despite the seasonal climate and features an array of architecture modeled on the Northern European aesthetics. The amount of energy necessary for this feat must be enormous... This is also the only part of the procession open to the children of The Creche as well as those outside the Fae community, as the activities during the rest of the year aren't typically 'child friendly'. Most of the Fae prescribe to their own hybrid collection of neo-pagan beliefs, but cannot resist the appeal of the old fashioned Yuletide traditions, especially where they intermingle with supposedly pagan ones.",True,False,False,,,0,1577860222,,False,0,{},fcpe8nh,False,t3_ei8w1q,False,True,t3_ei8w1q,/r/worldbuilding/comments/ei8w1q/in_honor_of_the_end_of_the_2010s_how_do_your/fcpe8nh/,False,,1586464237,2,True,False,worldbuilding,t5_2rd6n,r/worldbuilding,public,0,[],

Radio Free Asia (RFA) is a United States government-funded, nonprofit international broadcasting corporation that broadcasts and publishes online news, information and commentary to readers and listeners in East Asia. Its self-stated mission is ""to provide accurate and timely news and information to Asian countries whose governments prohibit access to a free press.""Based on Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, it was established in the 1990s with the aim of promoting democratic values and human rights, and diminishing Chinese Communist control. It is funded by a grant from the U.S. Agency for Global Media (formerly the ""Broadcasting Board of Governors""), an independent agency of the United States government. In 2017, RFA and other networks, such as Voice of America, were put under the newly created US Agency for Global Media, an independent federal agency.A short-lived earlier incarnation of Radio Free Asia also existed in the 1950s, as an anti-Communist propaganda operation funded by the CIA.RFA distributes content in nine Asian languages for audiences in China, North Korea, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam and Burma.

&gt; German and British consumers now face electric rates two to three times the average American retail rate, while industries flee to countries with affordable electricity. The German Association of Energy Consumers estimates that hundreds of thousands of families, no longer able to pay their electric bills, are reverting to wood-burning stoves and meager illumination. However well-meaning, the green crusade has become a threat to the foundations of human health and welfare.

&gt; Green energy policies are a gamble that renewables can supplant fossil fuels without energy scarcity, economic decline, physical suffering, or increased geopolitical vulnerability. The German and British green mandates have demonstrated that wind and solar energy are incapable of performing the tasks that fossil fuels have easily handled on a vast scale in modern industrial economies.

Plastic surgery is popular in several major cities (Los Angeles, Miami, New York). To my knowledge, there are no tent cities in New York City (which is a city in New York State) but homelessness is an issue in most major US cities. Tent cities are more of a thing is warm states like California. The American healthcare *system* is trash but it varies by state. For example, some states have poor insurance coverage for the general populace (like less than 40% of the adult population is covered) but some states have progressive legislation and pay for health insurance if you‚Äôre too poor to afford it (Massachusetts, 98% of the population is insured). While our healthcare *system* is bad, they actual quality of the healthcare is generally very good. We have the best medical schools in the world and some of the best doctors and surgeons (in particular). The issue is access to it. 

The birth control thing varies by state as well but 99% of the time a woman will have no issue getting something like the pill or the morning after pill. And it‚Äôs really only deep red (Republican) states in the South that try to do things like push ridiculous abortion legislation. In *all* states, a woman can get an abortion for *any* reason she pleases. It‚Äôs the law. The issue is 1) access like if there is only one abortion clinic in the state because all others have been defunded (this happens in those Southern states I talked about) and 2) cost. But in most states, particular blue (vote Democrat) states, a woman has access to multiple different abortion clinics and can even have the cost subsidized by the government. My state is even offering free IUDs to women below a certain income bracket! So I think the claim that women have ‚Äúlittle control‚Äù over their birth control is a vast oversimplification of the issue. 

Racism is an issue in the US as it is in every other country. It‚Äôs more complicated than I feel like getting into right now but there‚Äôs tons of literature and film out there about the issue. We just talk about it more because it‚Äòs an ever present issue. But I wouldn‚Äôt say that we are more or less racist than your country. And there are *certainly* countries in Europe that we are less racist than even if it‚Äôs simply by virtue of being less homogenous.

The most important thing to remember about the US is that every state, every region is different. There are states in the US that I would rather not live in. If you want to learn about the differences between states, a good way to go about it is by [region](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_of_the_United_States)(the World Interstate one is a good place to start). Another way to think about states is by political leanings. There are some broad generalization you can make about states and their cultures based on whether they are red or blue. Red states are those where the majority of the population votes Republican (Texas) and blue states are where the majority of the population votes Democrat (like New York stare or California). Typically, blue states will have more progressive legislature and better social safety nets but they will also have higher costs of living and more government oversight. In most blue states, it is very difficult to simply walk into a store and buy a gun. For example, in my state you must take classes, get documents signed by the local police and be certified in order to buy a gun. Red states will, generally, have a more religious populace and less government oversight on things like buying guns but they have poor social services and safety nets and poor economies. 

I hope my rant helped you understand a bit more about the US. We‚Äôre definitely not all gun-toting, meat eating weirdos that can‚Äôt go to see a doctor.

ETIAS¬†stands for¬†European Travel Information and Authorization System. The European Union has created this visa waiver program to protect and strengthen its borders. The main goal of the ETIAS visa waiver for Europe is to identify possible threats or risks associated with visitors traveling to any of the Schengen Area countries. The¬†ETIAS visa waiver¬†program will be needed to enter a Schengen member country.¬†In 2021,¬†all visitors that currently do¬†not need a visa to enter Europe¬†will be expected to apply for an¬†ETIAS travel authorization.
The¬†ETIAS for Europe¬†will grant travelers authorization to visit the¬†ETIAS countries, which are the¬†26 members that compose the Schengen Zone. The countries that make up this specific region acknowledge the abolishment of internal borders with other member countries.
Currently there are 60 countries that will need to¬†apply for an ETIAS visa waiver¬†when visiting the Schengen Zone. It is likely that ETIAS will be available to more countries in the future.
The¬†ETIAS visa waiver¬†has been designed for short-term stays of up to 90 days.

I decided to fly into a small town in Spain and get a bus to Portugal becuase it was cheaper than flying into Portugal at the time. 

The way the timing worked out for my journey home I would have to stay 1 night in that town in Spain before catching my morning flight. Trying to be frugal I booked the cheapest place near the airport. 

In the US motels are used by people in all sorts of situations. I grew up fairly poor and motels were where my family stayed on road trips to save money. 

While I was in Portugal someone gave me a heads up that motels in Europe are different and only used for one thing. Sex. That made me worried about the place I had booked, but it was booked and it was close the the airport, so I figured I would deal with it.

They didn't have to jointly invade anything, they just gave it away like they owned it, not even asking the people actually living there.

Sure, that's different than forcefully invading, but only in execution, the final result was still all the same.

You should also be aware that Western allies were indeed [sending war materials to the USSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lend-Lease). Which is something many US Americans will gladly tell you to justify their reasoning how it was the US that won WWII, even tho it was Eastern Europeans that actually paid the blood toll.

&gt; The spirit of the Munich Agreement was German containment, established through German promises not to seek further territorial gains in Europe. The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact more than enabled Germany, going so far as to carve Europe into spheres of influence.

The ""spirit"" of the Munich Agreement was ""Let's give the Nazis what they want and hope the problem solves itself after that"".

The problem with that being that it was the very same spirit that Germans used to justify their own claims even past the Sudetenland. 

In that context, it was completely naive to think that giving in to a blackmailer's demand will stop the blackmailing, it won't it will only embolden the blackmailer to ask for even more, which is exactly what ended up happening.

&gt; Any serious student of history knows that Stalin truly misjudged Hitler and believed that the pact had bought him a good period of peace.

Any *serious* student of history knows that Stalin very likely never intended to stick to the pact, as that was an impossibility with the political realities in Nazi Germany during that time stylizing the Soviets as their eternal arch enemy. 

Even somebody like Stalin, who wasn't exactly the brightest bulb among the bunch, couldn't see past that. That's why the MR pact was merely seen as a [Soviet form of appeasement](https://sci-hub.tw/10.2307/2697571), as Stalin assumed Hitler wouldn't target the USSR until England was defeated.

Yet here you are, supposedly a ""serious student of history"" who apparently doesn't even grasp those basics about the political situation back then. Why?

Currently the Paris opera orchestra are performing an outdoor concert next to the Opera Bastille after having been on strike for a month. This is something of a change of pace from the stone throwing and blazing cars of the yellow vests. 

So far as I can tell, one reason for this is that the pension protests are simply by the rich and for the rich. They also happen to be *left-wing*, unlike the yellow-vest movement. This is due to the fact that France is much further along in the voter realignment that is happening in many other Western countries, where the left loses low-income voters and but gains the upper-middle class. 

The French pension system, which is fundamentally the same one that was implemented after WW2, is highly regressive. Workers generally get paid according to how much they put in (unlike more equitable ones that tend to exist in Commonwealth countries). Private-sector workers are judged based off their best 25 years, but public sector workers are only evaluated on the last 6 months. So if you make it to senior management at the very end you're very well off indeed. In addition the system is riddled with special benefits for various well-to-do groups. For instance train-drivers, who are already very well paid and enjoy a slew of [other benefits](https://www.thelocal.fr/20180228/just-how-good-do-french-rail-workers-really-have-it), can currently retire at 52. All of this, combined with the fact the rich live a lot longer in the first place, tends to make for a system that virtually redistributes upwards.

From what [I've read](https://www.research.unicredit.eu/DocsKey/economics_docs_2019_173052.ashx?EXT=pdf&amp;KEY=C814QI31EjqIm_1zIJDBJLOZjNO8E5pmM9xdbdRHk6M=&amp;T=1), the pension reforms are undeniably progressive. The only way you can tell from the media though is the silence on the question on who will benefit and who will be worse off. Polling however seems to indicate that the protests enjoy wide-spread support. I suspect this is because the political inversion has confused a lot of people so that no-one anymore understands the class system or their place within it. 

The unemployment rate is 8.5%, but not because the economy is doing badly, but rather because unemployment is always high. France has a brutal two-tier labour market, where some workers enjoy very secure jobs in mostly unionised industries with some of the best protections afforded to any workers in the developed world. While an ever-growing marginalised group of workers either can't find work at all or exist in a precarious state jumping between lightly regulated short-term contracts. This is typical of over-regulated labour markets, and a direct result of the powerful unions and professional organisations who are also the ones currently protesting. Unfortunately the millennials who are struggling to start proper careers seem to think they're on the same side as the people on cushy permanent contracts, a delusion aided by the fact that the traditional left-wing media whose job it once was to foster 'class consciousness' are now very much on the side of the well-heeled professional class.",True,False,False,,,0,1577876446,,1577876887,0,{},fcq129m,False,t3_ehhmq2,False,True,t3_ehhmq2,/r/TheMotte/comments/ehhmq2/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_december_30/fcq129m/,False,,1586475301,33,True,False,TheMotte,t5_vkedk,r/TheMotte,public,0,[],

It also redistributes some wealth from for example millionaires and billionaires, which for every extra 1$ earned, only added 0.40$ to the economy.

&gt; If one country is affected by negative shocks that call for, say, lower wages relative to other countries, that can be achieved by a change in one price, the exchange rate, rather than by requiring changes in thousands on thousands of separate wage rates, or the emigration of labour. The hardships imposed on France by its ""franc fort"" policy illustrate the cost of a politically-inspired determination not to use the exchange rate to adjust to the impact of German unification. Britain‚Äôs economic growth after it abandoned the European Exchange Rate Mechanism a few years ago to refloat the pound illustrates the effectiveness of the exchange rate as an adjustment mechanism.

&gt; Proponents of the euro often cite the gold standard era from 1879 to 1914 as demonstrating the benefits of a common currency. But the gold standard also had its costs. The period was characterised by declining prices from 1879 to 1896, rising prices thereafter, and sharp fluctuations within each period, especially severe in the 1890s. The standard was viable only because governments were small (spending in the neighbourhood of 10% of the national income rather than 50% or more as now), prices and wages were highly flexible, and the public was willing to tolerate, or had no way to moderate, wide swings in output and employment.

If you didnt think it was possible, why bring it up and say it would be interesting if it happened? Sounds like you're contradicting yourself now.

&gt; I think it's you who doesn't seem to understand what the US is or what it's Military is. There is no chance that Iran could ever reach a US carrier

Then why is the US carrier fleet afraid to even enter the Persian Gulf right now? Its docked out somewhere in the choppy waters of the Gulf of Oman

https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/23/us/politics/warship-iran.html

In the article, they give some bogus excuse for being there. They apparently dont wanna raise tension by sailing in the Persian Gulf, but thats never been an issue before. The reality is that they know if things went sour, that carrier is in serious danger, due to the geostrategic advantages Iran has in the shallow and narrow waters of the Persian Gulf. Irans entire coastline is littered with missile launchers that would cause serious headaches.

&gt; There is nothing in Iran's arsenal that could reach a carrier without being shot down.

Anti-ship ballistic missiles my friend. Look them up. The US navy admits they would struggle dealing with these. Now add dozens of anti-ship missiles being launched at them at the same time, along with drones, cruise missiles and torpedoes, and you have a recipe for disaster. Iran even has anti-radiation ballistic missiles. They would turn the US' naval fleets powerful radars into homing beacons. So the US would have to turn them off to stop being targeted, leaving them vulnerable to other attacks.

&gt; Iran's ""drones"" are little more than uprated commercial drones similar to what ISIS uses.

This comment alone shows how little you actually know about Iran. Comparing Irans drones to the ones ISIS buys off amazon....Do some research and come back before you say any more embarrassing things

&gt; The US doesn't care much about the Saudis or the Emiratis

Global economy does. Thats what will suffer as a result. Its about threatening to bring maximum pain as a form of deterrent.

&gt; And yes you'd cause an amazing humanitarian crisis. And you just broke the rules about wishing violence on civilians. Attacking desalination plants would violate Geneva conventions.

Well dont start a war with Iran if you want to avoid it. The US doesnt give a shit about the Geneva conventions. They supported Saddam as he was using chemical weapons against Iranians. They supported Israel as it was bombing Lebanese infrastructure in violation of geneva conventions. They supported terrorists in Syria who carried out acts of genocide against the population. They support Saudi Arabia as it blockades the entire country of Yemen where over 100,000 children alone have starved to death. Why should Iran play by the rules if no one else is?

&gt; Israel can defend itself very well. The Iron Dome blocks all incoming weapons.

Once again showing how surface level your knowledge is. Iron Dome only deals with small projectiles like the couple bottle rockets Hamas fires from time to time. They dont deal with ballistic missiles. And they cant deal with guided missiles that can change course mid flight. And they certainly cant deal with thousands of rockets being fired at once from the Lebanese border, overwhelming their defences. 

&gt; Yes and this would primarily hurt China and Asia, not the US.

Not sure if you realise that high oil prices hurts the entire world. the entire global economy is interlinked. If there is a recession in China, there is a recession in many other parts of the world. If China have to spend twice as much just keeping the lights on, they dont have much to spend on other exports (including US exports). If Europe have to spend twice as much to keep the lights on, that less money they can spend on US exports. Same applies to the rest of the world. The point is to give the US pause for thought. Its entire economic order is under threat if they attack Iran....so they best think wisely.

I do think it's possible, I just said it's not ""reasonably possible"". This is not an absolute statement either way. I think it would be interesting to see what would happen in such a case. I don't think it's likely to happen.

&gt; Then why is the US carrier fleet afraid to even enter the Persian Gulf right now? Its docked out somewhere in the choppy waters of the Gulf of Oman

&gt; https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/23/us/politics/warship-iran.html

Except it's not. It was in the Persian Gulf earlier this month. Carriers don't sit in one place and are generally constantly moving. They're never ""docked"" in open water and keep moving, even if it's moving in circles. (There's no fuel to use as the nuclear reactors are always running and generating steam to power the ships.)

https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/us-naval-update-map-dec-5-2019

Recently it left the Gulf again and headed for Asia and CVN-75 is replacing it.

You're believing the opinion of some journalist who is only a correspondent with the Pentagon and acting as if it's fact.

I'd also note that what's written in that article (where it's a quote from a commander) is quite accurate. There's no need to subject the ship to additional danger when there's no need for it. The ships launched from the carrier have full range over Iran from where they are.

&gt; Anti-ship ballistic missiles my friend. Look them up.

I'm aware of them. The carrier groups are designed to defend against anti-ship ballistic missiles. Whether they're advanced at all is a complete different story. I've seen zero things written about worry about Iran's anti-ship ballistic missiles, but more about China's. I'd take that to mean that the US isn't worried about them.

&gt; Global economy does. Thats what will suffer as a result. Its about threatening to bring maximum pain as a form of deterrent.

The US is in the process of decoupling from the global economy. Again, this doesn't affect the US much. The US is not heavily economically involved in the global economy. The global economy is a tool of US soft power, not something that powers the US economy.

&gt; Well dont start a war with Iran if you want to avoid it.

Iran would be the one to start the war here. Especially if there's nationalist jingos like yourself in the leadership.

&gt; Not sure if you realise that high oil prices hurts the entire world. the entire global economy is interlinked. If there is a recession in China, there is a recession in many other parts of the world. If China have to spend twice as much just keeping the lights on, they dont have much to spend on other exports (including US exports). If Europe have to spend twice as much to keep the lights on, that less money they can spend on US exports. Same applies to the rest of the world. The point is to give the US pause for thought. Its entire economic order is under threat if they attack Iran....so they best think wisely.

More nonsense that isn't based in fact. Recessions elsewhere are never exported into the US. US recessions hit the entire world.

What happened in 2008 was a flash in the pan and nothing was fixed, there was just trillions of phony money printed to allow people in power/those who would bear responsibility for societal collapse to ignore it and thus the public ignore it, the problem is still there, and its getting bigger and bigger by the minute. Eventually this money printing will no longer work as the boomers die off and there is no debt slave consumer class to continue buying shit, then the trillions of phony money will come home to roost, a loaf of bread will cost a trillion dollars.

The biggest reason I‚Äôm considering Porto is because the Portuguese teams, from numerous financial reports I‚Äôve read, are really debt laden.

&gt;We are a EU-based Arma 3 community with a desire to grow. In our operations we rely on planning, communication, teamwork and deployment of adapted military tactics. While we enjoy more realistic aspects of the game, it is important that this does not compromise the gameplay experience. As such, we do not adhere to any military structure in terms of ranks etc. as all members are considered equal.

&gt;Our passion comes from challenging missions where we have to fight for a victory, never losing track of player experience. We do not want an easy victory where it is impossible to fail. We want challenging and immersive scenarios with reactive and responsive AI. In order to achieve this, our mission makers utilize a custom mission framework and various scripts in addition to the standard assets.


## About our operations


* Dedicated server for main operations, training grounds available during non-mission hours.
* Two weekly premade operations, set in modern day or cold war-era.
* Wednesdays 19:00 CET (GMT+1) or CEST (Summer Time, GMT+2).
* Saturdays 20:00 CET (GMT+1) or CEST (Summer Time, GMT+2).
* Units we play as includes (but is not limited to) US Army, US Marines, Tier 1 Operators, British Armed Forces, Bundeswehr and Russian Armed Forces.
* We play mainly as infantry, with additional helo and/or IFV support.


## What we are looking for


&gt;Emotionally mature and teamwork-oriented players who are willing to learn and improve. It doesn't matter if you are a battle hardened veteran or completely new to ARMA, everyone is equally welcome.


## About trainings we offer


&gt;Every new member will receive mentoring to ensure his smooth transition into our unit. In addition we provide voluntary specialist trainings for certain combat roles such as: marksman / sniper, combat medic, heavy weapons specialist and helicopter pilots. If you want to improve or learn these roles, we offer you many opportunities to do so though training days and mentoring.


## Requirements


* You are at least 18 years old and you are able to respect and understand others in the unit, and give and take criticism for personal learning. We give everyone a chance to show what they are made of.
* TeamSpeak 3 Client
* A working microphone
* Legal copy of ARMA 3 (also, while not required, we strongly recommend the APEX DLC)
* Weekly attendance. However, as real life always comes first, not everyone can always make this. In this case, just post a Leave of Absence so that we know and can plan the operations accordingly.


## About mods


&gt;We, like many other units out there, use a collection of mods to improve and expand the base game. Some of these mods have been further customized to better suit our needs. Size of the modset is currently around 40 GB, and we use Arma3Sync to distribute and keep it synced.


## How to join


&gt;Fill an **[application](http://www.7th-ranger.com/armarecruitment)** on our website. Once a Recruiter has reviewed it, he will contact you through Steam and invite you to our Teamspeak to have a chat. If we are what you are looking for and vice versa, you will get further access to all the needed resources to be able to join our operations.

Is this your way of pointing out that [Jessie Smollet is half Jewish?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jussie_Smollett#Early_life)

Are you somehow trying to imply that hate crime hoaxes are a common occurrence in the Jewish community?

A few years ago, there was a wave of hate crime hoaxes against Jewish centers.

Over 1,000 anti-Jewish threat phone calls were made. Bomb threats and other types of threats.

[JCC Threat-Makers: 2 Years, 1,000 Calls](http://newobserveronline.com/jew-jcc-threat-makers-2-years-1000-calls/)

Turns out that 2 Israeli Jews were paid in bitcoin to create this wave of hate crime hoaxes.

[JCC Threat-Makers ‚ÄúPaid with Bitcoin‚Äù](http://newobserveronline.com/jew-jcc-threat-makers-paid-bitcoin/)

No law enforcement has determined who paid them. But who benefited?

A very likely suspect is the ADL (Anti-Defamation League).

This wave of over 1,000 hate crime hoaxes was used by the ADL to raise huge amounts of money.

The ADL also used it as a pretext to pressure Amazon to ban a bunch of books on Holocaust Revisionism.

source:

https://codoh.com/library/document/5330/?lang=en

When the Israeli Jews were caught, the ADL blamed the bomb threats on ""white hate"" rather than a Jewish hate crime hoax.

[ADL: Israeli Jew‚Äôs Bomb Threats against American Jews are ‚ÄúWhite Hate‚Äù](http://newobserveronline.com/adl-counts-jews-162-bomb-threats-against-jews-as-white-hate-crime/)

So that's the current world.

 There's so little **real** anti-Jewish hatred that the Jewish Supremacists have to manufacture it with fake ""anti-semetic"" hate crime hoaxes.

But what about the reverse? What's the state of Jewish hatred against whites?

Here's an American rabbi preaching that God has given Jews a mission to ""fix the world""? 

But what happens to people who don't want their country to be ""fixed"" by Jews? Exterminate! Every man, woman, child, and even the babies must be genocided.

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/dtx7zi/exterminate_an_american_rabbi_says_god_had_given/f6z9jbl?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x

This rabbi specifically states that the countries that must be genocided are American and most of europe (white majority countries)

Of course, this rabbi pays no penalty for promoting genocide of white majority countries. Why not?

You aren't allowed to discuss or protest when Jews express genocidal hatred of white gentiles (non-Jews).

It's one of the many signs that we live under a SJS (System of Jewish Supremacy)

But most people don't know this, because the concept of [""White Supremacy"" is used as camouflage to cover up the fact that we actually live in a System of Jewish Supremacy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/d4al5e/why_do_universities_push_the_myth_that_black/f0alnsj/?context=3)

The ADL (Anti-Defamation League) [was created in order to free a Jewish child rapist/killer,](https://www.ancreport.com/report/adl-is-mafia-connected-and-defended-pedophile-rapist-and-murderer-leon-frank/).

The ADL is a [Jewish Supremacy group masquerading as a civil rights group.](http://www.unz.com/runz/american-pravda-the-adl-in-american-society/)

[No.](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/20/scottish-independence-lord-ashcroft-poll) Only 15% of No voters listed the EU as one of their top 3 reasons for voting to remain in the UK. The significance of the EU in the Scottish referendum has been retroactively played up by the Scottish Nationalists in an attempt to undermine the 2014 vote.

&gt; Then, two years later, England and Wales decided to leave the EU against Scotland's explicit will

Over a million Scots voted to leave. And 13 million people in England voted to remain. It's not like Wales and England were unanimously leave and Scotland was unanimously remain. Scotland is just a region in the UK where more people voted to remain - so is London, and so is Manchester, and so is a large portion of Northern Ireland. It was a national vote. Splitting the country up like a pizza and saying 'this area was dragged out against its will' just demonstrates that you don't understand what a vote is. And I say that as someone who voted for remain.

&gt; So Scotland has to face all the bad side effects of Brexit, while itself has no fault in it. 

Scotland literally would have had to leave the EU anyway if it voted to leave the UK. Choosing to leave the UK would have had far worse consequences for Scotland than leaving the EU would. ]

And by the way, all of this shit? It's just stuff from like the last 5 years. Scotland has been in the UK for 300. Political alignments change. Just 10 years ago, the Prime Minister was Scottish.

[],,VisionGuard,,,,[],,,,text,t2_4ggp7yre,False,False,[],"I'll leave it to someone else to refer you to specific literature, but I think there are two reasons:  economics and US History.

The first somewhat dovetails from military doctrine, and predominantly BRITISH doctrine -- namely that if you are a non-eurasian power, then if you control every naval chokepoint in the world and hem in your rival power on the Eurasian landmass, you control the world and thus its economics, which controls destiny.  Note that this really only words for a power that ISN'T in mainland Europe or Asia.  A major part of US military expenditure is basically to have full control of sea-lanes -- the US Naval Air Force is the second largest Air Force in the world behind the US's ACTUAL air force.  This permits control over sea trade - which is how most goods are transported cheaply around the world - and also secures tons of allies who wish to participate in that world.  Contrary to popular belief on reddit and especially here, this world has actually been insanely GREAT in very specific economic respects for the most part that plenty have benefited from, with very few highly expensive skirmishes in the way that it used to exist prior to the US, predominantly because the US uses that massive Navy to guarantee that, say, tiny Norway can transport its oil all the way to China without molestation, and previously smaller in power China could do the same with its cheaply made goods.  Really the only way to accomplish this control in earnest if you're not in Eurasia is to basically plant yourself on BOTH sides of Eurasia in earnest - and thus the US is seated in Europe and Japan/SK/Taiwan/Australia/NZ with various military treaties.

The second is US History, and the underlying existential fear that every US war planner and defense secretary is either born with or bequeathed.  While plenty in the Old World argue repeatedly that the US is ""protected by their two oceans"" and thus is a war mongering fool, you'll note that there were three major existential type wars in the history of the US that could have potentially destroyed it as it stood - Revolutionary, Civil, and WWII.  You'll note that those could ALSO be viewed as ""Atlantic"", ""Americas"", and ""Pacific"" in ORIGIN.  In other words, the US has literally been attacked in both major directions and from within almost in sequence, from the Sea when its foreign, and with dire consequences for losing that war.  Because of that, at the end of WWII, when the US had a chance to have world wide possible hegemony, its military planners literally stated that they wanted to be able to fight two massive wars in two ""areas"" of the world at any given moment - but everyone knew the underlying coded message to the world was that they would be able to fight an Atlantic and Pacific war simultaneously.  This was the only way to ""secure"" the US and avoid the existential conflict that threatened the US since its origin.  Also note that many of the current ""allies"" of the US were literally the ones trying to destroy it, and the world, only 70 odd years ago - so as much as there's this idea of the US being some two-faced ally since Trump, they're nowhere near that when it comes to waging world-ending style war against its current allies the way it was in reverse.  Hence, the US does loathe to give up the security that comes with controlling the entire world's military and telling everyone to basically go back to their corners and DEFINITELY never attack it, because without it a massive, possibly world war may START due to internecine Euro/Asian squabbling like has happened since time immemorial.

I'm not suggesting any of the above is currently RATIONAL, but I can see why the dominos would fall the way they have.  And now that it's in place and so many stakeholders benefit from US worldwide hegemony - ESPECIALLY allies that currently sling mud at the US for political points - its very difficult to dismantle in some kind of win-win manner.",True,False,False,,,0,1577896382,,1577897073,0,{},fcr3u20,False,t3_eij92w,False,False,t3_eij92w,/r/geopolitics/comments/eij92w/whats_the_theoretical_justification_for_the_size/fcr3u20/,False,,1586493988,92,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,0,[],

This obviously has nothing to do with individuals but this is how your kind always deflects the broad picture regarding forced diversity, lowering of wages through decreased IQ and economic mobility and security, increase in crime, decrease in standards of living, happiness, societal trust, and you never will acknowledge the caustic effect diversity obviously creates, from the beginning of human history, when two groups of people butt up against each other, as a whole there has never been anything but conflict. Never harmony.   
You are the type that can take a room filled with a brit protestant, a french catholic, a german lutheran, a spainard catholic, a greek orthodox, an italian catholic, an irish pagan and a scott atheist and complain about too many white people in the room, and you will see a room filled with 8 Sunni Somalians from the same town and say 'wow! such awesome diversity!""

Point is, for two communities to co-exist peacefully and harmoniously there has to be significant trust and respect. In India, all the problems are papered over with thin layer of ""secularism"", there is no effort to build mutual trust. First step in building the trust is to put forward the differences and then find the a solution for them. You can not build trust until you address these differences.

In America you would be called a liar/fool/bigot and what not if you say that Native Americans and early European settlers peacefully co-existed since beginning and Native Americans were not systematically destroyed to the brink of extinction. Americans today recognize and accept this history and try to make amends by providing special rights to Natives (e.g. Native American settlements).

Now replace Native Americans with Hindus and European settlers with Muslim invaders and you get the feel of Indian history. Difference being that in India Muslims are given special rights and privileges (special minority rights provided by constitution, yes a 200 million strong group is minority) and Hindus have to act as if nothing happened. Any attempt of talk about history is suppressed; bigot, Hindu Nazis, Islamophobe become the labels for people raising these issues.  

Since independence these issues are not talked about which has led to the current situation, where most of the Indians are silent against the law which would marginalize 200 millions (these massive protests you are talking about are limited to few cities and driven by mostly Muslim crowd, there are massive rallies in favor of this law). And we are not still ready to talk.

If you're a patchwork of little states who are fiercely independent, what you worry about is that the new federal state you are forming will select a church and pick favourite among the former colonies. Therefore, you want the federal state to separate itself from religion. You are fine with the local state having a state church and the church opining about politics at all levels.

Because the phrase is catchy and covers an important principal, it has stuck. Because people don't look at context (we do the same with the Bible), that phrase it taken out of its historical context to imply that a state shouldn't interact or talk on religion (broken frequently) and that a church shouldn't interact or talk on politics (broken frequently).

I bought both full price years ago and enjoy alternating between them every so often. Don't get me wrong, I love driving in Europe, but ATS's world feels more unique and interesting. People say ATS is boring because it's all desert, but realistically a majority of Europe, and therefore ETS2 is forested with tree walls on each side of the highway. The west side of the US may be mostly arid, but since it's a wide-open area they had to put more detail in mountains and landscape around the driving locations and each road has its own interesting and unique bit of something to look at because they can't cop out and spam a tree brush to paint the world in trees. That's not to say there aren't unique things, because (not so much in vanilla locations like the God-awful UK) there are unique buildings, roads, and locations in ETS2 that are nice to see if you're familiar with the area, but the terrain between cities being so wide open necessitates the whole world be a unique experience that you can see for miles away since outside of Oregon and Washington right now there aren't a whole lot of densely forrested areas that can be covered in trees.

The journey they‚Äôve had to go through to get him to academy level is probably ten times the effort and money for children of African/Caribbean or English/European descent.

He has said that there is still a fundamental level of racism against SI children in football.

There's literally only enough hours in the school day to teach history. At some point you need to discriminate, and the War of 1812 is a perfect example. While important to the US, it was a minor sideshow to the Napoleonic Wars to the UK, and ended up with the status quo being respected, versus the entire power balance of Europe shifting.

Yes, the US went on to be a superpower, but how much time does the US curriculum spend on the British Empire, which completely shaped the modern world? If we should cover the Revolutionary War with undue importance, you should be covering Trafalgar and Waterloo too with the same focus.

In all honesty, we spend more time discussing the French Revolution than the American one, simply because it had far more impact on shaping us as a nation. 

The loss of America wasn't the seismic event at the time that people feel it was. It was seen as too distant and costly to effectively subjugate and govern again, so effectively abandoned as a project. There really wasn't a lot of bitterness at the time. It was seen more as a failed police action than war.

The far bigger loss at the time was one of pride. But conducting a foriegn war thousands of miles away in the 1700s was hardly easy in logistical terms.

[],,HoidTheWorldhopper,,,,[],,,,text,t2_4bvjq3u6,False,False,[],"Because I guess there are some concepts you probably can't understand that are present in most European languages. For example, in English you say ""it"" for an object and ""he/she"" for a person, but in for example Portuguese there is no neutral pronoun so you have to learn the correct pronoun for each object (table is a feminine noun for example, while shoe is a masculine noun). 

In german there are 3 words for ""the"", a neutral, a masculine and a feminine version of the article (der, die, das) but there are also 4 conjugations based on what your sentence is (Nominativ, Akkusativ, Dativ, Genitiv). So when you say ""the table"", it's Nominativ, so in German ""der Tisch"", but if you say I *clean* the table, it becomes Akkusativ: ""Ich (I) putze (clean) *den* Tisch"" instead of ""der Tisch"".


If you say I put the table on the floor, floor is masculine (der) but in this context, it must also be conjugated in the Akkusativ form: ""Ich stelle (put) den Tisch auf (on) den Boden (floor)"". 


However, if the table was already there and you're only describing where the table is, you say ""der Tisch (Nominativ, so it's ""der"" not ""den"") liegt (lies) auf *dem* Boden"". Here it's not ""der"" nor ""den"", it's ""dem"", because it's Dativ.


 But if you're talking about something that belongs to the table, for example ""the table's chair"" you say ""der Stuhl (chair) *des Tisches* "" because then its Genitiv and not Akkusativ or Nominativ or Dativ

I know it sounds complicated (and don't get me wrong, it is, especially when you don't have time to think about what you're saying) but there are some languages with a lot more than only those 4 cases, for example in Russian there are 6 cases and in Hungarian there are 18. In English there are 3, but since the only article is ""the"", the only time you notice the cases is when you have a personal pronoun (he/him/his). 

To help you visualize this, [here](https://images.app.goo.gl/e9uX5AbpSjAceCcb6) is a simple comparison between German and English articles it and [here](https://images.app.goo.gl/hrCn4t4gSXY82utV6) is how you find out if the noun is nominativ, akkusativ, dativ or genitiv.

 And that's only definite articles, if you also consider indefinite articles (in English ""a"", as in ""a table"" and not ""the table"") there are also [these](https://images.app.goo.gl/RQFWiVbtFuTKW3dE6)

Also to complicate things, if you use an adjective it must also be conjugated based on what case the noun it is referring to is. [Example 1](https://images.app.goo.gl/4QVdpgCpBcNYAVsA9) and [Example 2](https://images.app.goo.gl/xuYvi5DjaqVz9SuGA)

Doesn't mean that income in lower strata isn't seeing increase. If you look at real wage increase, it's better than it was during early 2000s which was better than pre liberalization. Income inequality is not worse off because incomes of only select few saw the rise while everybody else is at the same level as they were 2 decades ago like in the west but that income of many didn't see increase as quickly as income of some.

The keyword is high here. A capitalist system will have income inequalities, but the rich cannot get richer at the expense of poor. What we see now is large scale wealth transfer from the poor to the rich. If the trend continues, the top 0.01% will become so powerful that they'll run the world (if they're not already doing it). The welfare programs are treating the symptoms, not the cause.

I was literally just saying that it's damn fishy that disney makes up the reason for orange sabers to exist, then adds info about prophecy only to then have Rey appear with an orange saber. I feel like you took the wrong things from what I meant and applied a lot of assumptions about it.


If you knew what I meant when I was talking about non-kyber orange crystals, then why waste time pointing out that I was wrong about it being a book and not a comic.


Bringing up a cosmetic choice (that was an incentive to sell pre-orders) in a video game is disingenuous to compare to Disney having information in a book, leading up to the release of their movie in which their new main character happens to wield a lightsaber using the now cannon color. The lightsaber colors in Fallen Order don't have anything to do with Cannon at all. In Fallen Order you can have a purple blade, which in EU was literally a ""Rare"" kyber crystal that Mace Windu went out an found on a special planet, just like the crystals in M&amp;A.


Maybe Rey's blade isn't one of these new cannon crystal's. And maybe there being extra prophecy about the special crystals being for special people, doesn't apply to Disney's newest special space princess. Unfortunately if Disney does decide to make Rey some prophesied thing, we can't do dick about it.

&gt; Sinfonia Electronique is an international collective of European, Asian, and North American musicians who have again come together to interpret new musical works created by its members. Once more focusing on compositions by American musicians Richard Eppedio and C.R. Keyser-Posner, and featuring performances by a select group of kindred musical spirits from various stylistic backgrounds, Sinfonia Electronique continues to move forward while maintaining a backward gaze, ever mindful of those who have come before them and blazed an amazing trail of musical mastery, leaving a legacy these performers strive to keep alive in the twenty-first century.....and beyond.

-Catalunha should at least had the chance to democratically be asked if it wants independence or not, the vote wouldn't be binding but at least it would open the door to negotiation to resolve some of the issues and if the issues aren't able to be resolved then maybe advance to democratic attempt to alter the Spanish constitution and possibly get independence by peaceful means.


-Oliven√ßa is Portuguese nacional soil that Spain has invaded, Spain should either give it back or at least declare shared boards between the two in order to protect the interests of the people living there and then later on give it completely to Portugal.


-people should come to terms that EU is walking a path to federalism since its inspection, functionally it already almost works much like one, the Lisbon treaty and the treaty of the functioning of the European Union are derive from a fail project to create a European constitution the alterations from that fail project and the current treaty are minor changes and we really need a European constitution. Also its better for everyone, we avoid another European bloodshed wars, better economy and we can make front against the bipolarization of the world's politics ( exp: US vs China or US vs USSR etc).


-electricity should be free or almost free and should be financially supported by taxation.


-we should create an agreement to disband the military of the world, and only focus weapon development for the protection of the collective good of mankind (i know its impossible such thing its in our nature to be selfish and destructive but it would be nice thought).

However you have to ask, why would they do that? They would be at a largely underdeveloped, mostly uncultivated land isolated from their neighbours. The tribal leaders at the time considered Ottoman state as a protection from Shia Iran to east, where they were more vulnerable to being invaded from because of Zagros, it is not just Ottoman state they have to contend with militarily but also Iran. 

Also in the case of Afghanistan, when one of the clans there managed to capture Isfahan in Iran, they declared themselves Shahs of Iran promptly. Nationalist feelings you mention wouldn't be present anywhere except few poets until 19th century, even then it was particularly slow to reach Muslims of the area who felt more strongly about Islam than nations. The type of independent, nation-state of Kurdistan could only be possible during dissolution of Ottoman Empire with nationalist consciousness like how other states got independence during 19th and 20th centuries but even then Kurdistan's central position would have likely made it a colony to British who wanted to have control of Basra to reach India, similarly in how they wanted to control Afghanistan.

So in purely military terms, it is possible they could gain independence and maintain it but in geopolitical sense it was at the time either illogical or improbable with any success towards east likely incorporating them into Iran.

Easy Company is likely as MILSIM as it would get for you. They are filled with good people, who know the game well. (I personally am not a big fan of the use of Band of Brother's names there, but that shouldn't take away from how kind the people are)

The other MILSIM group I can recommend is the 505th. They are more relaxed compared to Easy, but still have a structure and basic requirements.

MILSIM aside, there are also a few other groups you should be aware of.

Team Dixx (US) has a discord environment that's much more socially relaxed, BUT they host regular events (sometimes 2x a month). These events are usually a mixture of fun/casual games (like their recent Machine Gun Massacre event) AND hardcore/competitive games against other organized groups (playing Hell Let Loose at a top tier level). I am personally responsible for Team Dixx's Hell Let Loose operations, so I might have a big of a bias here, but after being with these guys for 4 months, I've loved their social atmosphere and playing HLL with their community. 

Powerbits (EU) ALSO does competitive events on a regular basis, typically fighting against the Russians (the IMP and WSS clans). The Russians are currently known as the best in the world when it comes to this game. They are more organized and more disciplined than Western Players, so I give much respect to Powerbits for continually training against them. If you want a gut-wrenching game experience, you'll likely find it with them.

82AD (EU) has just started getting into competitive events, and are among the top respected HLL groups. Their structure is based around membership more than a ranking system, but their community is active and fun to be around. I personally love chatting with their leader, IronFi$t. He's a good leader, and runs their community and their HLL server well. Their community is good at teamwork and working together to accomplish tasks on the game. 


I know this info may have been more than you asked for, but I hope it helps you find a community you like. Hell Let Loose is a game that's made for social groups like the ones above.

The big-nosed-creep character is almost always a *Japanese* character, in context - the guy in that example is Japanese, not European at all. I specifically wanted to find one who wasn't European as an example. Bonus points that he's from a strongly and explicitly anti-fascist, anti-racist work (Metropolis).       

There is sometimes a similar thing with big-lipped-good-hearted-slowpoke archetypes that can... really look like they're drawing from American and European racist caricatures of black people in other media. There are *also* a bunch of character designs that *do* draw from American/European racist caricatures of black people. Mr. Popo is... pretty clearly one of those. Where this gets weird is that it can be done without racist intent - those caricatures were *everywhere*, and a lot of Japanese artists internalized the stylization without picking up on the contempt. It is pretty common to see designs like that for dark-skinned characters in 80s/early 90s media, but for those characters to also be presented affectionately. Which is not to say that it isn't problematic, but that it's problematic and weird.    

edit: Also, I think you'd like Eva if you like Akira and Ghost in the Shell. It's a similar thoughtful, dark, pessimistic near-future cyberpunk-y thing. It's very flawed and the attempts at humor... mostly fail (except when they're great? the power outage episode - not the one where they siphon all of Japan's power into a big laser gun, but the other one with the microorganism that infects their ""computers""... the fact that it felt necessary to distinguish that says something about this show - has a lot of charming bits and the second movie genuinely melts my heart at points)... but it's still interesting and worth watching.

I taught in the US for almost 10 years prior to that. It‚Äôs tough to generalize teaching abroad with regard to benefits and salary, since that really is dependent on the region you work in. Outside of Western Europe, most legitimate international schools provide a good salary, some kind of housing benefit (either provided housing or a stipend to cover local rent), health insurance, flights to and from your home of record at the beginning and end of each year, and tuition waivers for dependents to attend the school you work at (if applicable). You may also get a PD allowance as well. Retirement is generally up to you to plan, though some countries may have a pension plan you contribute to or some schools may contribute to a retirement plan for you in addition to whatever you save on your own. Contracts are typically for two years, with yearly renewals after that. 

The standard bar for entry is a valid teaching license, which you will have to keep active while you work overseas and at least two years of experience. If you have specialized curricular experience (like teaching AP classes or the IB program), then that‚Äôs an advantage. That said, the top tier schools are very competitive, and just having a license plus two years doesn‚Äôt entitle a teacher to get hired at the American School of London, which some new teachers seem to think. It‚Äôs much easier to get hired if you are open to any location; teachers who lock into one location (like France or Japan) tend to be disappointed because they invariably pick the most competitive countries to try to work in. That said, your teaching license is valuable and marketable, so you shouldn‚Äôt be looking for work at language centers or cram schools or entry-level TEFL positions.

I like teaching internationally, but you do have to do your own due diligence when it comes to researching schools. Some schools are great non-profit private schools, some schools are for-profit, but still reputable, and still others are for-profit and the family business, so you may deal with a lot of unethical behaviors to keep parents and students (customers) happy.  Some schools are actually international ( I worked at a K-12 school with 450 kids from 75 countries) and some are ‚Äúinternational‚Äù in name only, which means all local students except for teachers‚Äô kids. People usually prefer the former,

Someone on this sub said that teaching abroad doesn‚Äôt mean no problems, it means different problems, which is pretty accurate. But I‚Äôve found that by and large, you are still working in a school, and your day to day job responsibilities aren‚Äôt that much different from working in the US.

[],,hluzier52,,,,[],,,,text,t2_3dhvjjjd,False,False,[],"I don‚Äôt know if they have mentioned the ‚Äûhigh representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina‚Äú? He is basically an appointed ruler of BiH (short for Bosnia and Herzegovina) who has a lot of power. The high representative is there to ensure that the ethnicities of BiH don‚Äôt start killing each other again.

Now the good news is that war has become less likely over the years. The reason why is not that good: young people are leaving Bosnia. It‚Äôs an exodus, rarely seen before in history. Why do they leave? Corruption and bureaucracy. BiH has over 100 ministers and many local governments. Each of them has some range of authority over laws which makes it hard for someone who would like to start a business to do so.

The federal government is in a deadlock for years now. Why? If the federal government wants to do something, like change a law or start any reform process, all three ethnicities have to approve. This almost never happens. 

Than there is corruption. You might ask yourself how BiH transitionned from a socialist to a free market economy. I will try to explain it: During and after the war, BiH‚Äòs government owned companies were privatized. The high ranking officials and politicians bought those companies for almost nothing or just stole them. Then they sold everything that company had and fired all the employees. Corrupt politicians got rich, while the people got poorer and poorer. Mass unemployment and a traumatized, nationalistic population were the right mixture to end in disaster. Politicians would blame other ethnicities or the war for the problems of BiH.

After those people robbed the country, they asked the international community for financial aid - and the international community gave Bosnia more money per capita in aid than to any other country in history, yet this aid didn‚Äôt help the people that much. The money ‚Äûdisappeared‚Äú into some corrupt person‚Äòs bank account. 

Without any light of hope, young, well educated people see their future abroad. There are some schools that train those people to get a diploma that is only valid in other countries like Germany.

If you would ask people in Bosnia if the country should split up or remain united, many, many people will tell you that they don‚Äôt want to live with the other ethnicities. If you asked Croatians in Croatia and Serbs in Serbia what they would rather want to see: a united Bosnia or a unification with their ‚Äûfellow countrymen‚Äú, a vast majority would choose the latter. So: why does BiH still exist? Because the EU and the international community want them to exist. They know that a breakup would lead to a war and so do many Bosnians. So, instead of breaking up, they tolerate this country but they don‚Äôt like it and don‚Äôt believe in its future.

In 2050, BiH is expected to lose even more people and will probably have around 2.8 million people by that year.

&gt; Faber found during his more recent scholarly research with British Naval Office records that in 18th-century Britain, Jews actually were not heavily invested in the trading part of the slave trade. ‚ÄúOverwhelmingly,‚Äù Faber said, ‚ÄúJewish merchants and shippers were not involved at all; they represent a minuscule portion of owners of ships.‚Äù While Jews did own slaves, he found, ‚Äútheir ownership was directly proportionate to their numbers.‚Äù


&gt; The Secret Relationship¬†gives a false and distorted picture,‚Äù said David Brion Davis, Sterling Professor of History Emeritus at Yale University and author of a trilogy on slavery, the first part of which won the Pulitzer in 1967 and the second of which won the National Book Award in 1976. ‚ÄúOf course, some Jews were involved in the slave trade. Every European Western nation was.‚Äù There were also some regions in which the slave trade was more accessible to Jews‚ÄîRhode Island, Newport, Holland, to name a few striking examples. ‚ÄúThe Dutch Jews weren‚Äôt persecuted, so there were quite a few who were involved.‚Äù


&gt; Much of the historical evidence regarding alleged Jewish or New Christian involvement in the slave system was biased by deliberate Spanish efforts to blame Jewish refugees for fostering Dutch commercial expansion at the expense of Spain. Given this long history of conspiratorial fantasy and collective scapegoating, a selective search for Jewish slave traders becomes inherently anti-Semitic unless one keeps in view the larger context and the very marginal place of Jews in the history of the overall system. It is easy enough to point to a few Jewish slave traders in Amsterdam, Bordeaux, or Newport, Rhode Island. But far from suggesting that Jews constituted a major force behind the exploitation of Africa, closer investigation shows that these were highly exceptional merchants, far outnumbered by thousands of Catholics and Protestants who flocked to share in the great bonanza.


&gt; Davis continues:


&gt; To keep matters in perspective, we should note that in the American South, in 1830, there were only 120 Jews among the 45,000 slaveholders owning twenty or more slaves and only twenty Jews among the 12,000 slaveholders owning fifty or more slaves. Even if each member of this Jewish slaveholding elite had owned 714 slaves‚Äîa ridiculously high figure in the American South‚Äîthe total number would only equal the 100,000 slaves owned by Black and colored planters in St. Domingue in 1789, on the eve of the Haitian Revolution.


Bem√¶rk, at j√∏disk involvering i slavehandlen er almentkendt, hvilket dine halvd√•rlige kilder ogs√• bekr√¶fter. Hvad de ikke p√•viser, er at j√∏derne var ekstraordin√¶rt fremtr√¶dende. Men g√¶tter ikke p√•, at nuancer er din st√¶rke side. Det var det i hvert fald ikke sidst.


&gt; Jeg synes du skal fucke af din klamme j√∏diske slavehandler-apologet.


√Öh, hvor er I dog forudsigelige. At du fors√∏ger at t√∏rre slavehandlen af p√• j√∏derne er fejt, og m√• jo bero p√•, at du ikke hviler nok i din etniske og kulturelle identitet til at kunne kapere, at j√∏derne ikke st√•r bag alt negativt. Jeg har personligt ikke det problem,men modsat dig ser jeg s√• heller ikke fortidens synder som et fastt√∏mret etnisk karakteristika, s√• jeg t√¶nker hverken at j√∏disk involvering i slavehandlen ligger nutidige j√∏der til last, eller at vores fremf√¶rd i Vestindien er mit eller andre nulevendr danskeres problem.

In late 2014, I started seriously saying to myself ""i cannot do this"".

I flew around 200,000-250,000 miles a year.  I spent 50%+ of my nights in a hotel and ate the same percentage of meals in planes/restaurants/customer cafeterias.

I would be in many time zone - fly from the east coast to europe (5-6 hours), or asia (12+ hours).  I'd leave on a friday night - get to my destination on saturday.  Feel completely ill all day sunday.  Then speak at a conference, deliver an 8 hour seminar, or meet with a customer for a day or two listening to their issues and developing some solutions (worked in technology/software).  Do this hopefully in the same city - but many times fly out tues/wed night to another country and do some more.  Then, fly home friday.  Dealing with time zones again...

Worked at home the next friday-friday (week on the road, week off - had my kids 50/50 custody, they came over friday night and left the next friday morning for school and went to her house).

and repeat.

I started having heart issues after a few years of this - afib big time.  I was going to take time off to correct it, put in for a sabbatical (I was pretty sure the sabbatical would turn into retirement, but since I didn't have to pull that trigger - I didn't).

six weeks into the sabbatical - this happened to me: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5dp2kk/serious_how_have_you_almost_died/da6ee0p/

that sort of cemented it, I extended the sabbatical to a full year, but in november of 2015 - I officially resigned.

and haven't looked back :)

I don't travel at all now, except for a vacation with my now retired wife (she joined me this year in retirement).  I can self entertain myself pretty easily.  I don't miss hotels, airports, restaurants, customer sites, conferences (i got to hate those things actually - for the people attending, they are a big party - getting away from work - for me, it was work) and so on.  not even a tiny bit.

Do you even read what I write?

&gt; the British way to implement serfdom in India gave the land to people who had nothing to do with the land.

As if Indians before that had a fair system. Not really.

&gt; Destroying Indian industries

They weren't destroyed. Traditional Indian industries weren't competitive at the time. For example, textile production decreased not because the British harmed it. Europe, the biggest consumer, grew its own production like never before, Italy is a good example.

&gt; to make India a source of raw materials for British industries

Like it wasn't a source of raw materials before? That was one of the main things India sold to other countries before being colonized. You make it seem that the British hurt Indian economy, while under their rule it grew. Not only material exports happened, production overall was steadily rising, just as consumption.

&gt; Exporting food grain

And paying money for that. The British bought grains, what an awful thing!

On 10 May 1940, Germany launched *Fall Gelb* (Case Yellow) - the invasion of France and the Low Countries. The attack succeeded to an extent that exceeded even Adolf Hitler's wildest expectations. Within six weeks, France and the Low Countries had fallen and nearly all of the British Expeditionary Force was interned in German Prisoner of War camps (after a failure to evacuate by sea at Ostend). The shocking victory would see British Prime Minister Winston Churchill ousted in a cabinet revolt, and the new British government seeking an armistice with Germany. By September of 1940, the ""Polish War"" would be concluded. In addition to reclaiming Alsace Lorraine, Eupen-Malmedy, and North Schleswig, Germany made a number of small strategic annexations in the West, imposed limitations upon the French military, and required France to pay war reparations. However, in return for these gains - and tacit acceptance of Germany's annexation of Poland, the German Military withdrew from the West. Hitler had secured his western flank such that he could pursue his real aim: the destruction of the Soviet Union and the incorporation of European Russia's vast agricultural and mineral resources into the Nazi domain. After the final peace negotiations in the West had been concluded, Hitler ordered the German High Command to draft *Operation Barbarossa*: a plan to conquer the Soviet Union up to an ""Arkhangelsk‚ÄìAstrakhan line"" in 1941.  


Joseph Stalin, leader of the Soviet Union, quickly became aware of Hitler's intentions to attack East. Stalin had always assumed that Germany would be unable to attack the Soviet Union so long as her armies were tied down fighting France and the United Kingdom - which would give the Soviet military time to reorganize and rearm such that they could face the German threat. However, the unexpected sudden conclusion of the war in the West had upended Stalin's entire calculus. Germany would now be ready to attack the Soviet Union after the Spring Rasputitsa had concluded in 1941. Germany's actions after the conclusion of the Polish War made it patently clear to Stalin that Germany was gearing up to attack. Despite the conclusion of hostilities, Germany did not demobilize any of its army divisions. Additionally, Germany began to station troops in Finland and Romania, while commercial and non-aggression treaties were concluded with Yugoslavia and Greece (which secured Germany's southern flank).  


War games conducted in Red Army staff colleges almost universally indicated that the Red Army would suffer significant losses and lose significant territory with their current defensive echelon strategy if the Germans were to invade. Against this backdrop, General Georgy Zhukov, the victor of Khalkhin Gol, [proposed a preemptive attack to Stalin](https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/wi-stalin-strikes-germany-first-in-wwii.352431/#post-10682509). Arguing for a limited offensive into German Poland (as well as a spoiling attack into Romania), Zhukov believed that a surprise attack could destroy significant numbers of German formations on the border, which would inhibit the Wehrmacht's ability to attack the Soviet Union. While war game simulations suggested that Zhukov's proposed attack would often fail to gain much ground or inflict many casualties, compared to the defensive echelon strategy, the front-line at the end of 1941 was closer to the German-Soviet border. Stalin was never fond of gambling on Offensive actions he wasn't certain he could win, but he felt the strategic situation forced his hand. The Soviet Union needed time more than anything else, and even if the attack might fail, Zhukov's preemptive attack could buy the Soviets enough time to survive the German invasion Stalin knew was coming. With some reluctance, Stalin approved the plan, and the Red Army began planning to launch an offensive at the end of June.  


In May of 1941, German reconnaissance aircraft detected the first movements of Soviet offensive assets towards the German-Soviet border. While denied by the Lithuanian government-in-exile, Nazi Germany allegedly received supplemental intelligence from resistance fighters in the Lithuanian Activist Front confirming this movement. The O*berkommando der Wehrmacht* (German High Command ) was now presented with a dilemma. Should the present offensive *Barbarossa* plan be maintained? or should the plan be scrapped in favor of a defensive posture? While many German generals, such as Heinz Guderian, argued that the best way to defeat the Soviets was to launch a preemptive attack - even if it meant moving the timetable for *Barbarossa* forward, more cautious elements within the OKW prevailed (as there was significant concern that the swollen river conditions would not allow the *Barbarossa* attack to be undertaken until too late), and *Operationsplan Siegfried* was drafted. Under the *Siegfried* plan, German infantry would hold prepared defensive positions, while the Panzer groups would be used as mobile reserve to smash any Soviet breakthroughs. Operating under the assumption that the Wehrmacht could inflict a casualty ratio equal to or greater than the Finnish inflicted upon the Red Army in the Winter War, it was believed that after two months of fighting, the Soviets would be worn out, which would allow a German advance to the D√ºna and Dnepr rivers before the onset of winter. The German Army would build up from that position over the winter, and launch a decisive campaign in the Summer of 1942.  


As it represented a significant scaling down of his *Barbarossa* plan, Hitler refused to accept the cautious plan, and immediately ordered the OKW to draft a new plan. While the OKW worked on a new draft of *Siegfried*, Hitler conferred directly with his favorite general, Erich von Manstein, to see if the mastermind of the Fall of France had any brilliant plans to achieve victory in the East. Within a few days, von Manstein presented his F√ºhrer with the rough outline of a plan: ""the backhand blow."" Hitler fell in love with the plan immediately, and ordered the OKW to prepare an operational version of the plan.  


The premise of the ""backhand blow"" was simple. Germany would allow the Soviets to attack first. German infantry formations were concentrated in prepared strong points known as *Widerstandsnest* (""Resistance Nests""), which were located astride the expected paths of any Soviet offensive action (but at least 20-30 miles from the border). Attacking these strong points in German Poland would tie down much of the Red Army in place. The German Panzers, assembled in launching-off points a few miles behind these strong points, would not be used as mobile reserve as in *Siegfried*. Rather, after waiting for the Soviet attack to get bogged down, the Panzers would smash through Red Army lines, and conduct a deep double-envelopment. Encircled, and cut off from supply lines, nearly all of the entire strength of the Red Army would be destroyed on their forward positions in a modern Cannae. From there, the German Army could advance almost unopposed towards the key cities of Leningrad, Moscow, and Rostov-on-Don. While some within the OKW were concerned that the plan was too ambitious, ""the backhand blow"" was formally drafted as *Operationsplan Sonnenwende* (Operation Plan Solstice), and received Hitler's enthusiastic approval.  


The Soviet attack (known as Operation Star) would occur on 30 June 1941. While making decent progress on their first day, the Soviets advanced stalled as soon as they encountered the first *Widerstandsnests*, with the Red Army suffering significant casualties*.* The Red Army sustained particularly large losses among their tanks, which were interspersed throughout their infantry formations, rather than concentrated in mobile units. Hoping to sustain offensive pressure across the front to break the German lines, Zhukov ordered Soviet reserves committed on 2 July 1941. The German strong-points continued to hold, though a few days into the attack, some infantry formations were beginning to be exhausted by the Soviet offensive, and the OKW was worried that some-strong points might soon break under the pressure of the sustained Soviet advance.  


As consequence, on the night of 4 July 1941, the codeword ""Dortmund"" was transmitted to field headquarters of all of the Panzer Groups. The following morning, *Operation Sonnenwende* would be launched.",True,False,False,,,0,1577916730,,False,0,{},fcshp2t,True,t3_eionq5,False,False,t3_eionq5,/r/imaginarymaps/comments/eionq5/operationsplan_sonnenwende_des_okh/fcshp2t/,False,,1586517826,15,True,False,imaginarymaps,t5_2vqof,r/imaginarymaps,public,0,[],

Hurry up! The number of vehicles is limited!To the AuctionCIS | Europe | North America | Asia The Auction offers you an opportunity to purchase rare vehicles. The main feature of the Auction is that the vehicle prices are lowered every day, but the amount of vehicles is limited, so they might go out of stock at any moment. Don't miss this chance to add rare vehicles to your collection!How does the Auction work?The Auction is held in three stages. At the beginning of the first stage, only some of the lots will be up for sale‚Äîfive vehicles, to be exact. For the next stage, another five tanks will become available for purchase, while the original lots will be removed within an allotted time period, even if they haven't sold out. And after that, this scenario will repeat once again. You'll always find the list of vehicles available for purchase on the Auction page.Here are the lots of the third stage!Lots for January 1‚Äì9Attention: On January 9, the Auction will close!The T28 Defender and IS-3 Defender{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/26494313/ac1963ce51747e1ab127c7ea3bc6985c1cf1d9d1.jpg{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/26494313/1c9cb7c31c393f02c09b4347d8557e9d213a63f0.jpgDespite their names, these vehicles will perform great not only on the defense, but on the attack as well.

Hylurgopinus rufipes, known as the native elm bark beetle, is a species of elm bark beetles in the tribe Hylesinini (crenulate bark beetles). It is found in Canada and US. It is of particular importance as a vector of Dutch elm disease. It is brownish-red in color and its size ranges from 2.34 mm to 2.9 mm.

***

**Scolytus multistriatus**

Scolytus multistriatus, the European elm bark beetle or smaller European elm bark beetle, is a bark beetle species in the genus Scolytus. In Europe, while S. multistriatus acts as vector of the Dutch elm disease, caused by the Ascomycota Ophiostoma ulmi, it is much less effective than the large elm bark beetle, S. scolytus.

S. multistriatus uses vanillin and syringaldehyde as signals to find a host tree during oviposition.

***

**Scolytus schevyrewi**

Scolytus schevyrewi, the banded elm bark beetle, is a 3‚Äì4 mm long elm bark beetle species in the genus Scolytus native from Asia and accidentally introduced to North America. It is a vector of the Dutch elm disease, caused by the Ascomycota Ophiostoma ulmi and Ophiostoma novo-ulmi. In North America, it is displacing both the native elm bark beetle and the previously introduced smaller European elm bark beetle, which are becoming less common in their range with the expansion of S. schevyrewi.

The United States of America (USA), commonly known as the United States (U.S. or US), the States or simply America, is a country comprising 50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories, and various possessions. At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km2), it is the world's third or fourth-largest country by total area and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe. Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico. With an estimated population of over 328 million people, the U.S. is the third most populous country.

**White people**

White people is a racial classification specifier, used mostly and often exclusively for people of European descent; depending on context, nationality, and point of view. The term has at times been expanded to encompass persons of Middle Eastern and North African descent (for example, in the US census definition), persons who are often considered non-white in other contexts. The usage of ""white people"" or a ""white race"" for a large group of mainly or exclusively European populations, defined by their light skin, among other physical characteristics, and contrasting with ""black people"", Amerindians, and other ""colored"" people or ""persons of color"", originated in the 17th century. It was only during the 19th century that this vague category was transformed in a quasi-scientific system of race and skin color relations.

**Greek language**

Greek (Modern Greek: ŒµŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫Œ¨, ellinik√°) is an independent branch of the Indo-European family of languages, native to Greece, Cyprus, Albania and other parts of the Eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea. It has the longest documented history of any living Indo-European language, spanning at least 3500 years of written records. Its writing system has been the Greek alphabet for the major part of its history; other systems, such as Linear B and the Cypriot syllabary, were used previously. The alphabet arose from the Phoenician script and was in turn the basis of the Latin, Cyrillic, Armenian, Coptic, Gothic, and many other writing systems.

**Caucasus**

The Caucasus  or Caucasia  is an area situated between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea and mainly occupied by Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Russia. It is home to the Caucasus Mountains, including the Greater Caucasus mountain range, which has historically been considered a natural barrier between Eastern Europe and Western Asia.Europe's highest mountain, Mount Elbrus, at 5,642 metres (18,510 ft) is located in the west part of the Greater Caucasus mountain range. On the southern side, the Lesser Caucasus includes the Javakheti Plateau and grows into the Armenian highlands, part of which is located in Turkey.The Caucasus region is separated into northern and southern parts ‚Äì the North Caucasus (Ciscaucasus) and Transcaucasus (South Caucasus), respectively. The Greater Caucasus mountain range in the north is mostly shared by Russia and Georgia, as well as the northernmost parts of Azerbaijan.

Rev isn't the best audio or the highest pay, but it's easier for beginners to jump into because it has its own editor, rather than you having to worry about buying your own software. I made over $200 on Rev alone last month, and I didn't do anything with it most days. I took on a couple of big files that were an hour or two long where the whole thing paid $60 or $70. You get to pick through the queue and decide for yourself what audio you want to work with, some of it is shitty and some of it is clear. You can preview the file before claiming, or if you're in a rush to grab it before someone else does, you can unclaim it within an hour or so without a penalty if the file isn't something you want to work with. On the forums, the owner of the company recently said many of the workers were Eastern Europeans, though when someone asked if any users present were Eastern European, I didn't see anyone chiming in. But it's very possible the owner knew there are a lot of Eastern Europeans based on users' IPs, as well as the new requirements to add an address (I am not sure if this requirement is US-only or not, they recently banned workers from the state of California due to a new law in California) and that Eastern Europeans either weren't doing unpaid socializing on the forums, or didn't feel like announcing themselves. At any rate, Europeans are allowed on Rev, I can say that much.

But my best advice here is honestly to experiment for yourself. Try a site, and if you aren't getting what you want there or just feel curious, try a different site. There are lists of transcription companies all over this sub, I can't add much to those because I only tried one so far myself, though I do intend to grow that over time as I see what works for me. See how long it actually takes you to transcribe stuff. See what things make audio worse or better for you personally. Individual transcriptionists have preferences. You'll hear all kinds of accents: American, British, Australian, Indian, several Asian ones, and more. There will be regional differences in all of those. Because I'm American, I find American accents easy, including regional stuff and AAVE, and I'm pretty good with Latin American accents as well. Some non-Americans find that stuff really challenging, but do fine with Australian accents I personally would not claim. You'll learn what types of difficult audio are easier or harder for you to work with. Some people hate stuff like chewing/eating sounds in the recording, others don't care. Pay attention to how much time you actually spend on it, and what speeds you up or slows you down. Read tips and tricks like text expanders and audio filters/post-processors, and see if any of those help you. Basically, just play around with it, worst case scenario you get a little pay for something that was a bit too much trouble to do on a regular basis, best case scenario you find something that works for you. I think covering your rent with transcription is completely achievable, but I can't promise it would be doable in a time frame that's workable or worthwhile for you.

The American Jewish Committee took a survey showing that 80% of Jews polled have seen an increase in Anti-Semitism in the US, and 43% say they've seen a significant increase.  That's almost identical for the statistics of Jews in Europe.

The ADL also showed a 150% increase in Anti-Semitic incidents in 2018 vs. 2013.

While Jews agree that Democrats need to do more to call out Anti-Semitism, the vast majority of Jews in the US blame Trump and the Republican party for the increase (89% blame the far right for the increase).

Where I'm from, southern Europe, *universities have more status*. They pride themselves on doing *research*, *publishing*, being bigger and have a more international presence (classes taught in English, well-known faculty from big universities abroad, etc.).

They also offer a *wider selection of degrees*, like medicine; nursing; engineering; science; math; teaching...

*Colleges will still give you a degree*, BS, BA, BSc or MSc, even a Ph.D. They are smaller, and usually more focused (i.e. business colleges). Some colleges here, business schools, in particular, outrank universities for the same programs in international rankings and are very well renowned.

This could be a local thing though, as you can't normally get financing when studying a program that isn't accredited, and the facility won't receive government funding either. So most 'real' schools will give a bachelor's degree at least.

The only stuff I see that isn't accredited, and thus pricey (but shorter/part-time and no degree) are like 3/6 month courses leading to a diploma in dental assistance, 'front end web dev', travel or secretary work. Think coding boot camps, just a bit more old school.

**What do you want to do?**

It depends on what you want to do too. For some companies, it may be more important which university/college you got the degree from, as they have graduate programs and recruit directly from certain facilities.

I might be an idiot, but I also doubt that **undergrad programs (in content) vary that much between different schools**. The curriculum seems pretty standardized ... You can check out the curriculum from any university/college for i.e. Calc I/II/III and it's really all the same.

I just have a hard time believing that learning Calculus, Physics or basic CS (BS level) from ACME college or MIT is ""that"" different. Those classes don't change. I used a 30-year-old calc book my grandfather had because I didn't want to blow $100 on some book ... and the calculus I learned worked just as well. I even used it for work and the math was as good as it was back when the old wise grey-haired people in the 1600s penned it.

Though, a 'fancier' institution may give you a better network and connections, and more status + easier to get into postgrad programs. But if you have to pay for it yourself, meh, it pick any hole in the wall college and learn the basics, get a BSc, and then apply for a nice uni if I really wanted to go in-depth.

I took a BSc from a university -- but not in CS -- petroleum engineering and geological engineering. In CS I'm 100% self-taught, and I have no issues in life or coding-wise.

KERATOSIS PILARIS;   aka ‚ÄòChicken Skin‚Äô.

Keratosis Pilaris is usually a minor deficiency of vitamin A. 

Take 5,000 iu of vitamin A (pre-formed Retinol) or a tablespoon 

of cod liver oil every day for 90 days. 

This is common knowledge and the usual treatment in Europe. 

If you are dark skinned, the cod liver oil is better as it contains vitamin D as well as A. 

Most dark skinned people in the Northern latitudes are marginally vitamin D deficient, 

and D and A are in sync. No improvement will be observed in less than 28 days 

as this is time it takes for basal cells to reach the epidermis, the top layer of the skin. 

And this needs to occur 3 times for softer skin.

This is not a fact because this is not happening. Nobody is reporting anything any differently because they feel less safe about anything. This is what happened in Europe after the Danish cartoon controversy when people were actually scared of publishing things.

&gt;No. Government should be transparent. It wasn't ""Trump"", a person, it  was ""the President of the US"", the head of state and head of government.  They have a responsibility to keep the public informed, which is what  media is for.

Who cares? It was still his press conference because he is the President. This happens all the time, and the Court ultimately said that he couldn't exclude the press firms he wanted to exclude anyway. Nobody cares how it happens in Germany.

Your question is PT 69 LR I Q 19

&gt; The goblin fern, which requires a thick layer of leaf litter on the forest floor, is disappearing from North American forests...

So let's get the basic structure

* Premise 1: The goblin fern requires thick layers of leaves on the forest floor
* Premise 2: The goblin fern is disappearing from North American forests
* Premise 3: In those places where it has recently disappeared, the leaf layer is thin
* Premise 4: Also in those places, there are many of a type of European earthworms
* Premise 5: This type of earthworm eats leaves on the forest floor
* Conclusion: The worm is probably (&gt;50%) the cause of the disappearance

This is a ""necessary assumption"" question.  For these, you usually must read all the answer choices, because there are an infinite number of necessary assumptions.  Fortuntely, you only need to pick from among 5.

* (A) States that wherever there are leaves on the forest floor, this fern appears.  This is clearly not necessary.  It's no problem to have leaves without ferns.
* (B) This addresses the origin of the worms.  This is probably an issue in conservation in real life, but is totally irrelevant here.
* (C) Says, where ferns have recently died, a greater percentage of the dead leaves are from the fern.  This may be true, but need not be true.  Perhaps these leaves are eaten instantaneously by another animal right when they die.  In fact, the stimulus uses the word ""vanished.""
* (D) Says that you can't have both worms and ferns in the same place.  This is tempting, because it makes it sound like it's saying the worms always kill the firms.  But this actually contradicts the conclusion, because the conclusion relies on the two being in the same place so the worms an eat the leaves on the ground causing the fern to die.
* (E) Says the worm doesn't favor leaf layers thinner than the fern requires.  This must be true.  Because if the worms required thinner leaf layers than the living ferns, the worms could not hurt the ferns easily, since the worms would rather go somewhere other than where the leaves are thick on the ground, which is where the ferns are.  The only real difficulty here is the word ""favor.""  But the direct issue is that if they *did* favor thinner leaves, then it is *more likely* that something else caused the layer of leaves to become thinner, which killed the ferns, which then allowed the worms to move in.",True,False,False,,,0,1577933597,,False,0,{},fct5rou,False,t3_eikdzd,False,True,t1_fcsi5ad,/r/LSAT/comments/eikdzd/negation_test/fct5rou/,False,,1586529296,1,True,False,LSAT,t5_2qsf8,r/LSAT,public,0,[],

Example being the average middle class black man in New York  has more in common with a middle class white man in California than a man in Africa because they are part of the same culture. And most black people above the poverty line act the exact same as white people above the poverty line so they will get along just fine

When it comes to poverty African Americans are at a higher rate of poverty mostly due to slavery and racist laws in the mid 1900s so you will see more poor black people acting irate (stealing shot like that) and generalize them as not getting along with white people because of diversity problems but as I‚Äôve said African Americans have been sharing the same culture for 300 years so it‚Äôs not that

That wasn't the point that I brought to the forum's attention. You stated multiple things. 

One thing you stated was: ""it's not like we all come from the motherland of Caucasia."" in which, if you are referring to Caucasians, then they *literally* did and that is why they are called *Caucasians*. 

&gt;
&gt;You're conflating the broader grouping of people with features that kinda sorta resemble those of people originating from the caucassus mountains with the recent, American invention of 'white' people.

Those two things are already commonly conflated and have nothing to do with me personally. 

Is ""white people"" an invention of the Americans?

[""The term ""white race"" or ""white people"" entered the major European languages in the later 17th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people?wprov=sfla1), in the context of¬†[racialized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racialization)¬†[slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery)¬†and unequal¬†[social status](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_status)¬†in the European colonies. Description of populations as ""white"" in reference to their skin color predates this notion and is occasionally found in¬†[Greco-Roman ethnography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Roman_ethnography)¬†and other ancient or medieval sources, but these societies did not have any notion of a white, pan-European race. Scholarship on¬†[race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_categorization\))¬†distinguishes the modern concept from pre-modern descriptions, which focused on physical complexion rather than race.""


The correct answer is: no. 


&gt;But none of that matters because your article notes that the primary classification DOES NOT focus on skin tone but phrenological basis (IE: the skull, something last taken seriously as an aspect of racial science before Jules Verne was imagining we'd get to the moon in a giant bullet fired from a giant fucking gun)

You left out the part where phenotypes and skeletal anatomy are also major factors in the Caucasian designation. Also, there is a distinct difference between phrenology (skull-based psychology) and ""cranial measurements for the classification of race.""

""In¬†[biological anthropology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_anthropology),¬†Caucasoid¬†has been used as an umbrella term for¬†[phenotypically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype)¬†similar groups from these different regions, with a focus on skeletal anatomy, and especially cranial morphology, without regard to¬†[skin tone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_tone).""

I also did not argue that skin tone was important factor in deciding race. Does someone race change when they get a sun tan? Or when they use products to lighten their skin? 


&gt;I'll just leave this here from the thing you left here as well;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Since the second half of the 20th century, physical anthropologists have moved away from a typological understanding of human biological diversity towards a genomic and population-based perspective, and have tended to understand race as a social classification of humans based on phenotype and ancestry as well as cultural factors, as the concept is also understood in the social sciences. **Although Caucasian / Caucasoid and their counterparts Negroid and Mongoloid have been used less frequently as a biological classification in forensic anthropology (where it is sometimes used as a way to identify the ancestry of human remains based on interpretations of osteological measurements), the terms remain in use by some anthropologists.**

FTFY. 

Let me also leave another 'thing' from the article for you to digest. 

""Among the earliest¬†[anatomically modern human](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomically_modern_human)¬†settlements established in Europe were¬†[Kostenki-Borshchevo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kostyonki,_Voronezh_Oblast),¬†[Voronezh Oblast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronezh_Oblast)¬†in southwestern¬†[Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia).¬†[DNA sequencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing)¬†of a 37,000-year-old male skeleton from the area, Kostenki XIV or Markina Gora, indicates that these early settlers possessed a similar genetic makeup as modern Europeans, but had dark skin and dark eyes. They also possessed slightly more¬†[Neanderthal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neanderthal)¬†genes than modern populations in Europe and Asia due to interbreeding with Neanderthals over 45,000 years ago.¬†In a study of Cro-Magnon crania, Jantz and Owsley (2003) have noted that these ""Upper Paleolithic crania are, for the most part, larger and more generalized versions of recent Europeans.""

Facing the draft, the Army offered me a way I'd never see Nam and an officer's commission to sign up to their intelligence corps. It would've involved one year of Russian only training, but five years. I opted for draft, where they yanked me out of grad school in early 1969 when it was a nightmare, with Johnson already announcing we would withdraw, and more Americans were killed after Johnson saying we'd pull out than before (but certainly better than being a Jew in Europe 1945), but they were sending any male who could walk into combat as support for war had collapsed 100%. Fortunately, despite the nightmare of basic where the sergeants, all Viet vets, loved to tell us the many ways we'd die over there, I lucked into a non-Vietnam slot and got an honorable discharge. but didn't return to graduate school. Lost my Russian. Totally fluent in Spanish. Life is funny.

But I do read a lot of history, and want to be civil. I read voraciously in history, a lot of WWII. I asked politely and you only insulted me. Instead of going through a bunch of books, a quick Wiki search says that I was 100% correct in the Finns refusing to advance beyond their old territorial border and didn't do much to Leningrad except. cut off its northern approaches, and stayed quiet for the next three years. Therefore, Finns did not, as you claim, participate in the butchery of Leningrad. WIKI:

""By August 1941, the Finns advanced to within 20 km of the northern suburbs of Leningrad at the 1939 Finnish-Soviet border, threatening the city from the north; they were also advancing through East Karelia, east of Lake Ladoga, and threatening the city from the east. The Finnish forces crossed the pre-Winter War border on the Karelian Isthmus by eliminating Soviet salients at Beloostrov and Kirjasalo, thus straightening the frontline so that it ran along the old border near the shores of Gulf of Finland and Lake Ladoga, and those positions closest to Leningrad still lying on the pre-Winter War border.

According to Soviet claims, the Finnish advance was stopped in September through resistance by the Karelian Fortified Region;[40] however, Finnish troops had already earlier in August 1941 received orders to halt the advance after reaching their goals, some of which lay beyond the pre-Winter War border. After reaching their respective goals, the Finns halted their advance and started moving troops to East Karelia.[41][42].""

I won't insult you in return but your statement was ludicrous. I asked you to back it up, claiming I hadn't read as much on Finland's role in Barbarossa as on Germany and its other allies. I was genuinely curious, wondering how I had missed it, and again, wondering why Stalin had been relatively gentle on Finland if it actually invaded Russia proper.

Those old documents released since fall of USSR show that Stalin and others were really Communist, that they discussed in private meetings that were recorded or with extensive official notes that they were since Communists who wanted to extend it worldwide. Stalin against hapless Allies extended Communism into Czechoslovakia, for goodness sakes, along with East Germany and rest of Eastern Europe. After WW2, would the US or UK do anything if he sovietized Finland? Esp if it were involved in atrocities? 

But Stalin, who was determined to retake as much of tsarist Russia as he could, and even took all of Eastern Europe, left Finland mostly alone, long as it stayed neutral. And partially, it seems, because Finland committed no war crimes in joining with Hitler, did not savage Leningrad as you falsely claimed.

For the next three years, the Finns did little to contribute to the battle for Leningrad, maintaining their lines.[43] Their headquarters rejected German pleas for aerial attacks against Leningrad[44] and did not advance farther south from the Svir River in occupied East Karelia (160 kilometres northeast of Leningrad), which they had reached on 7 September. In the southeast, the Germans captured Tikhvin on 8 November, but failed to complete their encirclement of Leningrad by advancing further north to join with the Finns at the Svir River. On 9 December, a counter-attack of the Volkhov Front forced the Wehrmacht to retreat from their Tikhvin positions in the River Volkhov line.[2][4]""",True,False,False,,,0,1577936917,,False,0,{},fcta13d,False,t3_eihpqm,False,True,t1_fct1ibf,/r/wwiipics/comments/eihpqm/a_finnish_snowmobile_during_the_continuation_war/fcta13d/,False,,1586531362,3,True,False,wwiipics,t5_2tb0j,r/wwiipics,public,0,[],

Lots to unpack here.

For one, I just want to say that the differences between the US and France when it comes to topics like multiculturalism, immigration, assimilation, secularism, race, and ethnicity are interesting and more nuanced than what you are portraying. In fact, a miniature version of this Anglo Franco cultural clash happens in Canadian politics. Both sides call each other racist and claim the others‚Äô policies and ideas do more harm than good. However, both POVs have their merits and are trying to solve roughly the same problems using different approaches. The conversation is bigger than I will delve in this comment, but I will recommend two podcasts if you are interested in this.

Code Switch is an American podcast talking about race relations in the US and one episode, [We Don‚Äôt Say That](https://pca.st/episode/49bdb065-47f1-42d6-8ced-18cb23db5f39) talks about how race is viewed in France. On the flip side, the Phileas Club is a French podcast about cultural differences between not just nationalities but also politics and subcultures.

As to the rest of the first paragraph, I can understand the perspective but I do think it is somewhat unfair that almost all the differences listed are negatives or perceived negatives.

I can totally understand why you would feel that former French colonies feel less alien. It could be due to French influence, but I also think it could be something else.  I think it‚Äôs exposure. It is possible that Senegal is more different than Poland but you have so much more exposure to Senegal that it feels less distant.

As for Latin America, I find that even more interesting. I‚Äôm Colombian myself but I grew up in Northern America. I‚Äôve always viewed Latin America as close to USA socially (at least the closer ones) but that could just be my bias since I am at the intersection of both so both seem familiar and it‚Äôs easier to see the similarities. It also helps that there are like, 55 million or so Latinos in Anglo-America so the Venn Diagram has a big overlap. I‚Äôm not even joking when I say 1 in 10 US Americans are also Mexican and 1 in 4 Mexicans are also US Americans. And that‚Äôs not even to say anything of Puerto Rico, where the US flag literally flies over. I will say this though, most Latin Americans I meet online seem to hate NA and relate more to Europeans.

Reasonable wealth taxes should be able to be dealt with by having relatively low withdrawal rates.

So, T1 and DRX won. T1 had better drafts and jungle/mid synergy, nice series overall. Damwon was disappointing, played like S9 and couldn‚Äôt snowball a 3 kill Akali into anything, DRX showed no weakness. -1.5U

¬∑ **LoL, LEC, Rogue in Playoffs (1.61, 15U, Pick of the Year) (end of January ‚Äì middle of March)**

So this line didn‚Äôt move yet and I decided to hammer it even more. Rogue added their academy roster after the last place in Spring season and became a middle of the pack team right away. At the end of the season they were considered a top4 team entering playoffs, sweeping Splyce 3:0. Next round was a 1:3 loss to Schalke, they mental boomed after Larssen threw away game 3 with a Corki package into the fountain. Because of their Spring season, they were denied the Regionals and therefore Splyce moved into worlds with many people claiming RGE were the 3. best team in EU by now. Jungler Inspired won the Rookie of the split with Midlaner Larssen being the runner up. Both around top3 in their roles. Finn in the Toplane was also no slouch, having 2 Game MVPs but performing worse vs more experienced laners. The amazing thing is, they did this with 2 of the 3 worst ADCs in Europe (although Woolite stepped up in playoffs). Oldie Support Vander was fine, also having some MVP carry performances.

They added prodigy ADC HansSama to their roster, once hailed as the 2. best ADC in Europe. Misfits superteam failed, so he had to move into the academy team. He was the only player from the main roster to get his starting place back and had GREAT games despite the shit team around him.

So we have a top4 team from last season, which only ‚Äúfailed‚Äù because of their ADC and unexperienced rookies. They hard upgraded their only weak spot and now have one season of experience and more built up synergy. Many people rank them right below G2 and FNC at 3. In order to get into playoffs, they only need a 6. place (out of 10).

Imo this line is a joke, there is no way 6 teams are stronger than this lineup. Should be at 1.20 or something

¬∑ Im going to put a decent amount into T1 ML (line moved hard, try to find something with at least 1.5) and DRX -1.5 for the KESPA Cup, writeup will follow at matchdays.

Also, Im on twitter (VrsaiLoL), not much going on yet, but I will try to post some live bets there soon. Maybe alrdy at the weekend.

**Article**:

&gt; MONSEY, N.Y. (AP) ‚Äî F or years, ultra-Orthodox Jewish families pushed out of increasingly expensive Brooklyn neighborhoods have been turning to the suburbs, where they have taken advantage of open space and cheaper housing to establish modern-day versions of the European shtetls where their ancestors lived for centuries before the Holocaust.

&gt; The expansion of Hasidic communities in New York‚Äôs Hudson Valley, the Catskills and northern New Jersey has led to predictable sparring over new housing development and local political control. It has also led to flare-ups of rhetoric seen by some as anti-Semitic.

&gt; Now, a pair of violent attacks on such communities, just weeks apart, worry many that intolerance is boiling over.

&gt; On Dec. 10, a man and woman killed a police officer and then stormed into a kosher grocery in Jersey City, fatally shooting three people inside before dying in an hourslong gunfight with police. The slayings happened in a neighborhood where Hasidic families had recently been relocating, amid pushback from some local officials who complained about representatives of the community going door to door, offering to buy homes at Brooklyn prices.

&gt; And on Saturday, a man rushed into a rabbi‚Äôs home in Monsey, New York, during a Hanukkah celebration, hacking at people with a machete. Five people were wounded, including one who remained hospitalized Tuesday. Federal prosecutors said the man charged in the attack, Grafton Thomas, had handwritten journals containing anti-Semitic comments and a swastika and had researched Hitler‚Äôs hatred of Jews online.

&gt; At a meeting Monday hosted by U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand in Rockland County, where Monsey is, some Jewish leaders blamed inflammatory rhetoric on social media and from local elected officials for the rising threat of anti-Semitic violence.

&gt; Days after the killings in Jersey City, a local school board member there, Joan Terrell-Paige, assailed Jews as ‚Äúbrutes‚Äù on Facebook, saying she believed the killers were trying to send a message with the slaughter. ‚ÄúAre we brave enough to explore the answer to their message?‚Äù she asked.

&gt; A widely condemned political ad last summer created by a local Republican group claimed that an Orthodox Jewish county legislator was ‚Äúplotting a takeover‚Äù that threatens ‚Äúour way of life.‚Äù

&gt; ‚ÄúIn the last few years in Rockland County I have seen a rise in hate rhetoric, and I was able to foresee it would end in violence,‚Äù said Aron Wieder, the legislator targeted in the video ad. ‚ÄúYou have seen on social media where the Orthodox community has been called a cancer, leeches, people who don‚Äôt pay taxes. It has become normal and accepted to say derogatory and hateful things about Jewish people.‚Äù

&gt; Swastikas have been scrawled around the county, and frightened parents are asking law enforcement for more visible security at synagogues and schools, Wieder said.

&gt; Bigoted messages have gone unchecked for years, said Rabbi Yisroel Kahan, administrative director of the Oizrim Jewish Council. He pointed to hateful comments on social media and false online rumors that have spilled over into everyday life.

&gt; ‚ÄúIt has been tolerated for far too long,‚Äù he said.

&gt; Hasidic families began migrating from New York City to suburban communities in the 1970s, hoping to create the sort of cohesive community some recalled from Europe.

&gt; Rockland County, 15 miles (24 kilometers) northwest of Manhattan, now has the largest Jewish population per capita of any U.S. county, with 31%, or 90,000 residents, being Jewish. The ultra-Orthodox population is highly visible in small towns like Monsey, where bearded Hasidic men in black overcoats and fedoras converse in Yiddish along the sidewalks and Orthodox women wear modest black skirts and head scarves as they go about their daily errands.

&gt; In small towns everywhere, resentment against newcomers and ‚Äúoutsiders‚Äù isn‚Äôt uncommon. Proposals for multi-family housing complexes in sleepy communities of single-family homes often trigger fervent opposition complete with lawn signs and rowdy town board meeting crowds.

&gt; Yet the tone of the debates over growth in some areas where Hasidic families have been moving has been more intense. 

&gt; In East Ramapo, there were legal fights after Hasidic voters, who generally do not send their children to public schools, elected a majority of members of the local school board. 

&gt; Some towns have enacted zoning changes forbidding new houses of worship. 

&gt; In the small town of C...

Not true, YPG is Syrian offshoot of the PKK, they directly share equipment and menpower.

Erdogan might have bought oil from ISIS, which is terrible if it's true. No arguments there. But this is not the point. Point is Obama armed insurgent groups in Syria, and then they became the ISIS, and then US government supported YPG to kill the ISIS they've created, which also happens to be terrorizing Turkey.

Why is West supporting YPG?

1- To create a Kurdish sattalite state to guard the oil, and protect Israel

2- To sell more weapons by destabilizing the region

3- Because of anti-Turk lobbies

Choose one or more.

I agree that Ben surviving would have been more interesting, but him healing Rey established without a doubt that he returned to the light side because Force Healing is firmly a light-side ability the dark siders cannot use. As for mirroring the OT's redemption arc, well, that's actually a very common theme in a lot of stories, both inside the EU legend stories and outside of Star Wars as a whole. It's not a rehash but a common story telling device.

There's nothing wrong with going by a formula. It typically guarantees structure and proper plot points. That's not this series' problem. The problem here was the lack of pre-planning for the whole trilogy. I personally would have loved to see some galactic threat like the Yuuzhan Vong or even Abeloth. Both of those would have forced Luke to team up with his enemies (if we're keeping all the same characters, then that would be Kylo). We'd get to see Luke as the amazing Grandmaster he was supposed to be and see him do crazy amazing stuff. And him dying by sacrificing himself at some point would be perfectly fine also. Maybe he did so to protect his small band of trainees or something.

I also would have been fine with TFA as is, with Luke having isolated himself, not out of fear, but because he sensed the great threat through the Force and went to Ach'to to meditate and prepare himself for what's to come. And with Rey showing up he would realize he doesn't need to face the threat alone and comes out of isolation.

I don‚Äôt know enough about all of the countries to think of anything else and like I said, get very overwhelmed and discouraged when doing research.

Regarding Hostels. I‚Äôve never booked one and I guess I have a fear of some kind of ‚Äúno vacancy‚Äù and I end up having to sleep on the street because I can‚Äôt find a place to stay. It happened to me in San Francisco one time and it wasn‚Äôt the funnest experience. I know once I book my first one, the fear will probably go away. But since I‚Äôve never booked one before and am unfamiliar with the typical availability, it gets me a little anxious. Especially if I‚Äôll be in an unfamiliar country with a different language.

So far I‚Äôve just been looking at other people‚Äôs itineraries on the internet just to get a feel for what a travel plan might look like. I‚Äôve learned a lot just by doing that. I took a basic one that hits various cities in Germany, Czechia, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria, Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Amsterdam. I want to fit Warsaw, Poland in there somehow.

I‚Äôve also learned about the euro rail pass. So I assume I‚Äôll end up getting one of those to take care of the long stretches of travel.
 
AND I‚Äôve also learned that it‚Äôs better to spend more time in certain areas to enjoy the travel rather than try to hit everything just for the sake of hitting it. So, for that reason I may cut a few locations out. I have a hard time imagining distances and knowing how much time I should spend in a given location.

Is that the UK has never really considered itself European or really involved with European politics. (Up until really last Century) This really stems from the napoleonic era when all of mainland Europe was on the continental system and Britain was either at war or isolated from them. And now given the ever closer union of the EU. the uk governments has been against any further integration this really hampered any moving forwards because the EU doesn‚Äôt like to two it on a couple of country‚Äôs basis and wants the change to happen throughout the whole block. 

Leading up to the independence referendum the government tried to get CONCESSIONS from the EU to get a remain vote if I‚Äôm being honest this is not a sign of a team player but of a member only in it for the economic benefits. Which I respect but instead of allowing the rest of the EU to carry on (and opting out) they have been blocking and vetoing legislation in the EU. This has frustrated many on the continent. And it‚Äôs true. The BCC did a ‚Äòwhat Europeans think about brexit‚Äô whilst pretty much all where sad about the breakup some where optimistic for the EU to get going again seeing the ‚Äòsoon‚Äô departure of the UK as a way to move forward. 

We don‚Äôt see the Brits as ‚Äòinferior‚Äô quite the opposite. We are tired of the UK‚Äôs objection to everything. 

Its just that politics has caused a divorce and a parting of ways there‚Äôs no other way of really putting it. It‚Äôs a sad breakup. But with good; governments, commissions and good will I think both parties can succeed.

There absolutely is - higher the speed, larger the distance. Speed is way of adjusting distance, but ultimately distance is the key here: mainly you have to keep large enough distance to stop in time in case vehicle in front of you slams on their brakes. Meanwhile, you adjust speed based on other factors. Legal speed limit is only one of them, flow of traffic is important, weather etc.

Bottom line is decreasing speed wouldn't change jack shit if he was driving at proportional distance. You can be going at 1 km/h and still rear end someone if you're driving all the way up his ass. That's why there is such a thing as 'X second rule' when it comes to driving, which is measure of distance changing with speed. How many seconds you need? Well, there are varying recommendations but main part is understanding two factors:

1) Braking efficiency - generally speaking modern road cars have surprisingly similar stopping distances, but there is a bit of a difference. If you're driving older car, with heavy load or - even though you shouldn't drive such car at all - one with terrible tyres and/or brakes, adjust for it.

2) Reaction time - modern research actually suggests old ""1,5s reaction time"" or ""average 2,1 s reaction time"" is actually completely wrong. It varies a lot, and is actually dependent on kinematic cues more than anything.

Hence, usually the answer to 'how many seconds of distance I need to keep' is 2 or 3.

There's even more to that. For once, you're not just looking at the car in front of you. Or rather: you shouldn't. You should watch car in front of that one, and preferably the one in front, and one in front... basically always look as far ahead as you can, don't just focus on nearest object. If you're reacting to the same obstacle the car in front of you is at the same moment he is, you don't have to brake as hard and you will warn people behind you who again will have more time to react (and you can adjust your braking force too and avoid getting rear ended).

&gt;Even if he was under the speed limit, if he hits someone from behind its 100% his fault and there‚Äôs not a legal system in the world that has a different view.

That's not ""100%"". It's a lot of %, but there absolutely are exceptions. For example if a car changes lane in front of you there's no legal expectation for you to react quickly enough, at least in any European country.",True,False,False,,,0,1577976728,,False,0,{},fcuaxnk,False,t3_eiux42,False,True,t1_fcu5ssi,/r/IdiotsInCars/comments/eiux42/well_this_excuse_ought_to_be_good/fcuaxnk/,False,,1586549368,2,True,False,IdiotsInCars,t5_3aimx,r/IdiotsInCars,public,0,[],

The most expensive part is easy. In the UK the government doesn't subsidise rail operations (they do subsidise investment in new tracks etc). Almost every other country in Europe uses tax revenue to subsidise operations.

According to the latest EU figures (published 2019, covers 2016) operational subsidies range from 0% in the UK to 400% in Bulgaria. The Czech Republic provides 160% subsidy (ie for every 100 taken in fares, the government provides another 160, so total revenue is 260. In the UK the fares have to be 2.6 times as high as the Czech Republic to get the same revenue) 

[https://ec.europa.eu/transport/sites/transport/files/6th\_rmms\_report.pdf](https://ec.europa.eu/transport/sites/transport/files/6th_rmms_report.pdf) p40

Eliminating subsidies from operations is a political decision but it's also based on the fact the UK has the most congested railways in Europe. Passenger numbers have more  than doubled since the early 90s and have now reached their highest ever levels. As a result the UK now has 40% of all the congested track in the EU.

The UK still has subsidies for some operators, but they are paid by levies on the busier services: [https://orr.gov.uk/\_\_data/assets/pdf\_file/0013/40351/uk-rail-industry-financial-information-2017-18.pdf](https://orr.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0013/40351/uk-rail-industry-financial-information-2017-18.pdf) p16",True,False,False,,,0,1577977801,,False,0,{},fcuckpy,False,t3_eixvsz,False,False,t1_fcu4gm7,/r/Scotland/comments/eixvsz/rail_fares_to_go_up_across_scotland/fcuckpy/,False,,1586550153,7,True,False,Scotland,t5_2qkli,r/Scotland,public,0,[],

For the homosexual population, the transmission risk would be 3 times higher through 3 times more gay men being infected, 10x more through the gay community being 10x smaller than the general population and 30x more through the transmission rate being 1.7% instead of 0.04%, which would be an overall 900x increase or a transmission rate of approximately 0.027% per MSM encounter.

I also found this, About [15% of gay and bisexual men have HIV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV_and_men_who_have_sex_with_men), while 28% of transgender women test positive in the US.

So, HIV definitely is problematic for the gay community even in the first world.
