&gt; none of those countries are even governed by Kurds, nor are those countries governing for Kurds.

I was only using the Kurdish people as an example of the consequences of the Sykes-Picot Treaty from the 1910's and 20's. The treaty is the post-WWI precursor, along with the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, towards drawing the boundaries we see today in the Middle East. The British and French Empires quite literally did not have any Middle Eastern influence/correspondence/voting on the Sykes-Picot Treaty. Honestly, by the end of WWI, the British and French Empires had actually allowed Russian and Italian imperial interests to be represented, recognized, and respected as well. Not a single Middle Eastern interest, imperial or not, was ever represented during these treaty agreements between European empires.

If Kurdish people were actually represented during the treaties, then it could be argued that they were not recognized with respect (for example, they were gerrymandered). That's not the case tho -- they weren't even represented from the very beginning. Whatever consequent states arise, like Iraq/Iran/Turkey/Syria, will inevitably arise due to European imperial interests, not out of the interests of the indigenous masses (remember, Kurdish people aren't the only ones neglected by the treaties). I think the bottom section of the Wiki page I linked on Sykes-Picot Treaties, with the section title of [The Agreement in Practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes‚ÄìPicot_Agreement#The_Agreement_in_practice), talks about the various borders and their associated state governments.

The Earth? No. Europe, which is a tiny corner of the planet? Sure.

&gt; Since its origins, the earth has experienced periods significantly warmer than the modern world -- some epochs have been even hotter than the most extreme predictions of global warming -- and times much colder than today. Today's cool temperatures are well below average for the globe in its more than four billion year history.[21] During one of the warmest such eras the dinosaurs roamed the earth and a rich ecological world flourished.

How do you know this? Climate scientists did the research. The same scientists who tell you there's a problem now.

&gt; Studies of climate history show as was mentioned above that sharp changes in temperatures over brief periods of time have occurred frequently

How brief?

&gt; without setting into motion any disastrous feedback systems that would lead either to a runaway heating that would cook the earth or a freezing that would eliminate all life.

Nobody is arguing that runaway warming is going to happen.

&gt;In addition, carbon dioxide levels have varied greatly. Ice core data exhibit fluctuating levels of CO2 that do not correspond to temperature changes.

They do, actually, when you take all other known factors into account.

The main attraction of this event was an item called the bloodhound heirloom that cost $40.

The reasoning for this stupid pricing model was even more of a shitshow, with devs insulting players, calling them entitled and freeloaders. Eventually, Respawn apologized for the behavior and made some changes to the event. Unfortunately, in a way they made it worse: people could buy the exact skins they wanted for $18, basically double that of the loot crate.

Not to mention the whole Battlefront II controversy that started the campaign against loot boxes within different parliaments across Europe and more recently the U.S. 

The funniest part is that in one hearing, a representative from E.A referred to loot boxes as....SURPRISE MECHANICS, comparing the mechanic to that of a Kindle egg.

Syria has little to no oil reserves of their own. What they have is a Russian natural gas pipeline to Europe.

That being said  since the dissolution of the Warsaw pact, NATO should have been straight up abolished and tremendous amounts of bloodshed would have been avoided. This  I agree on.

So 1hz the screen would refresh 1 time per second (which would look terrible).  Films are usually 24hz (or 24 frames per second).  50hz the screen refreshes 50 times a second.

Way more info than you need below:

Original analog TV in the US was usually 30hz.  Europe was usually 25hz.  Europe and US had different TV refresh rates because the systems were based on the power distribution in those areas.  In the US the electrical grid runs at 60hz, so matching that timing for analog TV made sense.  Europe used a power frequency of 50hz, so they matched that.

But wait, you may ask, US power is 60hz but they were 30hz for refresh rate, that doesn't match?  You are right it doesn't match for frame rate.  Old analog TV was interlaced because CRT's couldn't refresh a full screen fast enough so they could only do half the display at once (so lines 1,3,5,7... then lines 2,4,6,8...).  Each half a frame is called a field.  So:

2 Fields = 1 Frame

or 

60 fields per second = 30 frames per second

Fields were what was actually matched to the the electrical grid for timing. So 60hz power = 60 fields per second = 30 full frames per second.

As technology advanced and HD was developed and CRT's were replaced, progressive formats became more standard.  Progressive meaning the screen renders the lines as you would expect (1,2,3,4,5...). So in the US 60hz refresh rates since they had 60hz fields in the past so 60hz stayed.  In Europe 50hz is more common because of its history.  Both work fine and TV's these days can do either.  So you really won't have issues.

(If you really want your mind blown, 60hz is not actually the refresh rates, because when TV moved from B/W to color they had to tweak things, so for broadcast standards while we say 60hz, it's actually 59.94.  When we moved to HD that 59.94 stayed as well.)",True,False,False,,,0,1577845735,,False,0,{},fcoz9xw,False,t3_eibm8q,False,True,t3_eibm8q,/r/appletv/comments/eibm8q/any_harm_in_setting_atv_to_50hz/fcoz9xw/,False,,1586456624,3,True,False,appletv,t5_2s3df,r/appletv,public,1,[],

&gt;**Rumors and concerns about aspartame causing a number of health problems, including cancer, have been around for many years.** **Some of the concerns about cancer stem from the results of studies in rats published by a group of Italian researchers, which suggested aspartame might increase the risk of some blood-related cancers (leukemias and lymphomas). However, later reviews of the data from these studies have called these results into question. The results of epidemiologic studies (studies of groups of people) of possible links between aspartame and cancer (including blood-related cancers) have not been consistent.**

&gt;In general, the American Cancer Society does not determine if something causes cancer (that is, if it is a carcinogen), but we do look to other respected organizations for help with this. Based on current research, some of these organizations have made the following determinations:

&gt;The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has concluded that ‚Äúthe use of aspartame as a general purpose sweetener‚Ä¶ is safe.‚Äù
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has stated, ‚ÄúStudies do not suggest an increased risk associated with aspartame consumption for‚Ä¶ leukaemia, brain tumours or a variety of cancers, including brain, lymphatic and haematopoietic (blood) cancers.‚Äù
Though research into a possible link between aspartame and cancer continues, these agencies agree that studies done so far have not found such a link.

I can't recall the source offhand, but one of the largest international communist organizations at the time,  identified fascism as an enemy of socialism back in the 1920s. The Soviets would've been aware of this. So the Soviets teaming up with fascism to start an imperialist war of aggression, particularly when socialist political economy doesn't depend on imperialism to function ‚Äì it doesn't make sense. 

The Soviets didn't invade Poland; nor did they annex or partition it with Nazi Germany. The Red Army entered into what was then a legally non-existent State (the Polish government fled to Roumania two weeks earlier), and the Supreme Commander of the Polish military ordered his troops not to attack the incoming Red Army. Therefore, the Soviets weren't a belligerent. The Soviets only advanced up to the territory that was illegally seized from Belarus and Ukraine in the 1919-21 Soviet-Polish war. That occupied land was later rightfully returned to the Ukrainian and Belarusian SSRs. 

The Soviet ""occupation"" of Poland basically saved Poland as a State and stopped the Nazis from massacring the Poles and Jews (as what happened in Lw√≥w), because the Eastern half was safely under Soviet guard. After the war, Poland was rebuilt as an independent State (not an Soviet Socialist Republic) out of Soviet kindness. Remember also that Poland was allowed to leave the Warsaw Pact and the Eastern bloc when the counter-revolutions of 1989 ‚Äì 91 happened. If the Soviets were so ""repressive"", both Yugoslavia and Poland would've been kept under the Soviet belt. They weren't, even when the Soviet military-political apparatus was at its most powerful. 

Molotov-Ribbentrop pact was neither a military alliance nor a collaboration with Nazi Germany. Poland had a non-aggression pact with Hitler too (signed in 1938), and it eagerly seized land from Czechoslovakia and shared logistics with the invading German army. In contrast, there is no discussion among the German General Staff of Soviet participation in the partition or annexation of Poland. The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact defined respective German and Soviet spheres of influence in Europe, with the Curzon line or Poland's eastern border defined as being within the Soviet sphere. ""Spheres of influence"" were a recognized concept in diplomacy and international law well before World War II, and aren't equal to annexation or partition, which is what the Munich Agreement of 1938 that partitioned Czechoslovakia was. 

The public, Western, ""academic"" ""historical"" narrative is that the Allies ""caved in"" to Hitler's demands. The truth is that the Allies (the imperialist-capitalist countries of Britain, France, and the United States) were turning a blind eye to Nazi German aggression with the implicit understanding that the Nazis would eventually turn their aggression East toward their mutual enemy, the Soviet Union. 

The Soviets offered an anti-fascist alliance with the West, one week before the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. The Allies purposely dragged their feet on the proposal and it went nowhere. The M-R pact was a last ditch effort of Soviet diplomacy to delay war and buy time for Soviet preparations for eventual war against Nazi Germany, not a collaboration to partition Poland. 

The M-R pact accomplished several things: 

* Made certain that Nazi Germany was seen as the aggressor;
* bought time for the Soviet military to prepare for war against Germany;
* prevented the Allies from allying with Nazi Germany *against* the Soviet Union, had the USSR decided to prematurely fight a war against Nazi Germany all alone. 
* created a buffer zone between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union,
effectively saving the eastern half of Poland from Nazi destruction. 

The Allies never fought a battle in Poland. It was the Soviets who liberated Auschwitz. [Western governments had knowledge of some scale of genocide for at least two years prior to the camps' liberation, but did little to stop the slaughter.](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/world-history/holocaust-allied-forces-knew-before-concentration-camp-discovery-us-uk-soviets-secret-documents-a7688036.html)

This is the true history of World War II, not taught in the Western education system or discussed in ""academia"" because it violates the anti-communist presuppositions of the discourse.

However, one community in particular marks the new year in a very different way from the rest. 

The Fae community of New Zealand --a transhumanist subculture that evolved from the cosplay fandom-- mark the passing of seasons with a continuous 'Faerie Procession' across the largely wilderness environments of the South Island where they established their main colony. (chosen for its appearance in many fantasy themed films) It is the centerpiece of their cultural and social activity. Each Spring a Faerie king and queen (or sometimes two of each...) are democratically elected to symbolically lead the procession. They may be from either of the two chief sub-groups of their society; the Seelie and Unseelie Courts. (the actual election process is rather elaborate, and deliberately so because the role is symbolic and so the whole thing something of a game) The primary stops along the procession coincide with the months of the alternating solstices and equinoxes --March, June, September, December-- but since they are located below the Equator, the seasons are reversed. Thus they choose to end the year with the June Winter solstice and start the new year --and new procession-- on the September Spring equinox. On the months in-between the procession disperses and plans are drawn up for the new year. 

Each of the 'courts' is represented by a 'pavilion' structure whose architecture is designed to thematically compliment the seasonal atmosphere. Being transhumanists of the 'Naturist' sort, the Fae employ a lot of augmentations which allow them to comfortably tolerate the outdoor environment without the need of the usual shelter. So most of the visible architecture that they employ is based on open structures with mostly social/symbolic function. Thus these pavilions typically consist of an open structure ringed by columns, with or without a roof. Other architecture tends to be hidden underground so as to not impact the aesthetic of the natural habitat. (with the exception of The Creche where couples wanting children go to raise them --which is relatively rare in their polyamorous society) Each encampment stays in place for the month of the solstice/equinox with the flanking months in build-up/knockdown/and travel with shorter stays at other encampments. The community casually drops in and out of the events of the procession at their leisure, the chief congregations on the key solstice/equinox ritual events. 

The Spring Court is arrayed at the base of a preternaturally large tree in a dense forest which provides the 'roof' for the assorted pavilions around its base. A main amphitheatre-like space dominates the other structures, all with a common Art Nouveau-inspired aesthetic. It also features an elaborate complex of structures in its branches and deep among its roots and hosts one of the primary nexuses of the community's generally hidden technical infrastructure. This is the favorite spot for the Seelie Court with the rituals ushering in the new year and the coronation of the new procession nobles held here.

The Summer Court is set inside a large round grassy hill rather like a tumulus overlooking the shore which appears as if its crest has been sliced through and lofted on a series thick columbs. A series of step terraces descend to a sunken inner floor with a large domed ceiling. It is surrounded by a number of other smaller pavilions and small dense copses of trees set in a rolling hillside descending to the shore where various open beaches and sheltered coves can be found. 

The Autumn Court is crafted to look like the stone ruins of an abandoned Gothic cathedral set in a vast graveyard overtaken by forest. It is surrounded by a variety of open pavilions, stone circles, tombs, mausoleums, and caves all deliberately crafted to be a bit creepy-looking. Unsurprisingly, this is the favorite area for the members of Unseelie Court. It is here that a symbolic ritual slaying of the nobles takes place at the end of the season where they are killed either by 'treachery' or in 'combat'. Typically, if both the nobles are of the same court, their reign ends in combat as the opposing court seeks to take over the area in mock battle. If they are of mixed courts their reign ends in treachery with a mock assassination. The two courts routinely engage in various ritualized mock battles, mostly in Summer and Autumn, said to be inspired by the 20th century's Society for Creative Anachronism, and many aspire to cultivating extensive ancient warfare and martial arts skills, albeit with non-lethal weapons and techniques. 

The Winter Court is set on another, rocky, hill topped with a stone circle and overlooking a rugged coastal area, often subject to stormy weather. Here a large wooden longhouse is crafted (from mock lumber) in a style that mixes Norse and Maori aesthetic themes. It is usually accompanied by a number of other yurt-like structures. Here the symbolically 'dead' nobles preside over the end-of-year rituals and are honored at the end of the season with a mock funeral. The members of the procession pay their final respects to the nobles and make final goodbyes to others before departing the longhouse and dispersing back to other areas. As a last act those assembled dismantle the longhouse to create a huge bonfire with the official end of the procession marked by the burning of the noble's thrones. 

There is an additional Yule Village setup during the Summer season which is intended for those who wish to celebrate the traditional European holiday seasons and new years. It is an elaborate construction created in a sheltered mountain valley which, by means kept secret, is usually supplied with snow despite the seasonal climate and features an array of architecture modeled on the Northern European aesthetics. The amount of energy necessary for this feat must be enormous... This is also the only part of the procession open to the children of The Creche as well as those outside the Fae community, as the activities during the rest of the year aren't typically 'child friendly'. Most of the Fae prescribe to their own hybrid collection of neo-pagan beliefs, but cannot resist the appeal of the old fashioned Yuletide traditions, especially where they intermingle with supposedly pagan ones.",True,False,False,,,0,1577860222,,False,0,{},fcpe8nh,False,t3_ei8w1q,False,True,t3_ei8w1q,/r/worldbuilding/comments/ei8w1q/in_honor_of_the_end_of_the_2010s_how_do_your/fcpe8nh/,False,,1586464237,2,True,False,worldbuilding,t5_2rd6n,r/worldbuilding,public,0,[],

Radio Free Asia (RFA) is a United States government-funded, nonprofit international broadcasting corporation that broadcasts and publishes online news, information and commentary to readers and listeners in East Asia. Its self-stated mission is ""to provide accurate and timely news and information to Asian countries whose governments prohibit access to a free press.""Based on Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, it was established in the 1990s with the aim of promoting democratic values and human rights, and diminishing Chinese Communist control. It is funded by a grant from the U.S. Agency for Global Media (formerly the ""Broadcasting Board of Governors""), an independent agency of the United States government. In 2017, RFA and other networks, such as Voice of America, were put under the newly created US Agency for Global Media, an independent federal agency.A short-lived earlier incarnation of Radio Free Asia also existed in the 1950s, as an anti-Communist propaganda operation funded by the CIA.RFA distributes content in nine Asian languages for audiences in China, North Korea, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam and Burma.

&gt; German and British consumers now face electric rates two to three times the average American retail rate, while industries flee to countries with affordable electricity. The German Association of Energy Consumers estimates that hundreds of thousands of families, no longer able to pay their electric bills, are reverting to wood-burning stoves and meager illumination. However well-meaning, the green crusade has become a threat to the foundations of human health and welfare.

&gt; Green energy policies are a gamble that renewables can supplant fossil fuels without energy scarcity, economic decline, physical suffering, or increased geopolitical vulnerability. The German and British green mandates have demonstrated that wind and solar energy are incapable of performing the tasks that fossil fuels have easily handled on a vast scale in modern industrial economies.

Plastic surgery is popular in several major cities (Los Angeles, Miami, New York). To my knowledge, there are no tent cities in New York City (which is a city in New York State) but homelessness is an issue in most major US cities. Tent cities are more of a thing is warm states like California. The American healthcare *system* is trash but it varies by state. For example, some states have poor insurance coverage for the general populace (like less than 40% of the adult population is covered) but some states have progressive legislation and pay for health insurance if you‚Äôre too poor to afford it (Massachusetts, 98% of the population is insured). While our healthcare *system* is bad, they actual quality of the healthcare is generally very good. We have the best medical schools in the world and some of the best doctors and surgeons (in particular). The issue is access to it. 

The birth control thing varies by state as well but 99% of the time a woman will have no issue getting something like the pill or the morning after pill. And it‚Äôs really only deep red (Republican) states in the South that try to do things like push ridiculous abortion legislation. In *all* states, a woman can get an abortion for *any* reason she pleases. It‚Äôs the law. The issue is 1) access like if there is only one abortion clinic in the state because all others have been defunded (this happens in those Southern states I talked about) and 2) cost. But in most states, particular blue (vote Democrat) states, a woman has access to multiple different abortion clinics and can even have the cost subsidized by the government. My state is even offering free IUDs to women below a certain income bracket! So I think the claim that women have ‚Äúlittle control‚Äù over their birth control is a vast oversimplification of the issue. 

Racism is an issue in the US as it is in every other country. It‚Äôs more complicated than I feel like getting into right now but there‚Äôs tons of literature and film out there about the issue. We just talk about it more because it‚Äòs an ever present issue. But I wouldn‚Äôt say that we are more or less racist than your country. And there are *certainly* countries in Europe that we are less racist than even if it‚Äôs simply by virtue of being less homogenous.

The most important thing to remember about the US is that every state, every region is different. There are states in the US that I would rather not live in. If you want to learn about the differences between states, a good way to go about it is by [region](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_of_the_United_States)(the World Interstate one is a good place to start). Another way to think about states is by political leanings. There are some broad generalization you can make about states and their cultures based on whether they are red or blue. Red states are those where the majority of the population votes Republican (Texas) and blue states are where the majority of the population votes Democrat (like New York stare or California). Typically, blue states will have more progressive legislature and better social safety nets but they will also have higher costs of living and more government oversight. In most blue states, it is very difficult to simply walk into a store and buy a gun. For example, in my state you must take classes, get documents signed by the local police and be certified in order to buy a gun. Red states will, generally, have a more religious populace and less government oversight on things like buying guns but they have poor social services and safety nets and poor economies. 

I hope my rant helped you understand a bit more about the US. We‚Äôre definitely not all gun-toting, meat eating weirdos that can‚Äôt go to see a doctor.

ETIAS¬†stands for¬†European Travel Information and Authorization System. The European Union has created this visa waiver program to protect and strengthen its borders. The main goal of the ETIAS visa waiver for Europe is to identify possible threats or risks associated with visitors traveling to any of the Schengen Area countries. The¬†ETIAS visa waiver¬†program will be needed to enter a Schengen member country.¬†In 2021,¬†all visitors that currently do¬†not need a visa to enter Europe¬†will be expected to apply for an¬†ETIAS travel authorization.
The¬†ETIAS for Europe¬†will grant travelers authorization to visit the¬†ETIAS countries, which are the¬†26 members that compose the Schengen Zone. The countries that make up this specific region acknowledge the abolishment of internal borders with other member countries.
Currently there are 60 countries that will need to¬†apply for an ETIAS visa waiver¬†when visiting the Schengen Zone. It is likely that ETIAS will be available to more countries in the future.
The¬†ETIAS visa waiver¬†has been designed for short-term stays of up to 90 days.

I decided to fly into a small town in Spain and get a bus to Portugal becuase it was cheaper than flying into Portugal at the time. 

The way the timing worked out for my journey home I would have to stay 1 night in that town in Spain before catching my morning flight. Trying to be frugal I booked the cheapest place near the airport. 

In the US motels are used by people in all sorts of situations. I grew up fairly poor and motels were where my family stayed on road trips to save money. 

While I was in Portugal someone gave me a heads up that motels in Europe are different and only used for one thing. Sex. That made me worried about the place I had booked, but it was booked and it was close the the airport, so I figured I would deal with it.

They didn't have to jointly invade anything, they just gave it away like they owned it, not even asking the people actually living there.

Sure, that's different than forcefully invading, but only in execution, the final result was still all the same.

You should also be aware that Western allies were indeed [sending war materials to the USSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lend-Lease). Which is something many US Americans will gladly tell you to justify their reasoning how it was the US that won WWII, even tho it was Eastern Europeans that actually paid the blood toll.

&gt; The spirit of the Munich Agreement was German containment, established through German promises not to seek further territorial gains in Europe. The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact more than enabled Germany, going so far as to carve Europe into spheres of influence.

The ""spirit"" of the Munich Agreement was ""Let's give the Nazis what they want and hope the problem solves itself after that"".

The problem with that being that it was the very same spirit that Germans used to justify their own claims even past the Sudetenland. 

In that context, it was completely naive to think that giving in to a blackmailer's demand will stop the blackmailing, it won't it will only embolden the blackmailer to ask for even more, which is exactly what ended up happening.

&gt; Any serious student of history knows that Stalin truly misjudged Hitler and believed that the pact had bought him a good period of peace.

Any *serious* student of history knows that Stalin very likely never intended to stick to the pact, as that was an impossibility with the political realities in Nazi Germany during that time stylizing the Soviets as their eternal arch enemy. 

Even somebody like Stalin, who wasn't exactly the brightest bulb among the bunch, couldn't see past that. That's why the MR pact was merely seen as a [Soviet form of appeasement](https://sci-hub.tw/10.2307/2697571), as Stalin assumed Hitler wouldn't target the USSR until England was defeated.

Yet here you are, supposedly a ""serious student of history"" who apparently doesn't even grasp those basics about the political situation back then. Why?

Currently the Paris opera orchestra are performing an outdoor concert next to the Opera Bastille after having been on strike for a month. This is something of a change of pace from the stone throwing and blazing cars of the yellow vests. 

So far as I can tell, one reason for this is that the pension protests are simply by the rich and for the rich. They also happen to be *left-wing*, unlike the yellow-vest movement. This is due to the fact that France is much further along in the voter realignment that is happening in many other Western countries, where the left loses low-income voters and but gains the upper-middle class. 

The French pension system, which is fundamentally the same one that was implemented after WW2, is highly regressive. Workers generally get paid according to how much they put in (unlike more equitable ones that tend to exist in Commonwealth countries). Private-sector workers are judged based off their best 25 years, but public sector workers are only evaluated on the last 6 months. So if you make it to senior management at the very end you're very well off indeed. In addition the system is riddled with special benefits for various well-to-do groups. For instance train-drivers, who are already very well paid and enjoy a slew of [other benefits](https://www.thelocal.fr/20180228/just-how-good-do-french-rail-workers-really-have-it), can currently retire at 52. All of this, combined with the fact the rich live a lot longer in the first place, tends to make for a system that virtually redistributes upwards.

From what [I've read](https://www.research.unicredit.eu/DocsKey/economics_docs_2019_173052.ashx?EXT=pdf&amp;KEY=C814QI31EjqIm_1zIJDBJLOZjNO8E5pmM9xdbdRHk6M=&amp;T=1), the pension reforms are undeniably progressive. The only way you can tell from the media though is the silence on the question on who will benefit and who will be worse off. Polling however seems to indicate that the protests enjoy wide-spread support. I suspect this is because the political inversion has confused a lot of people so that no-one anymore understands the class system or their place within it. 

The unemployment rate is 8.5%, but not because the economy is doing badly, but rather because unemployment is always high. France has a brutal two-tier labour market, where some workers enjoy very secure jobs in mostly unionised industries with some of the best protections afforded to any workers in the developed world. While an ever-growing marginalised group of workers either can't find work at all or exist in a precarious state jumping between lightly regulated short-term contracts. This is typical of over-regulated labour markets, and a direct result of the powerful unions and professional organisations who are also the ones currently protesting. Unfortunately the millennials who are struggling to start proper careers seem to think they're on the same side as the people on cushy permanent contracts, a delusion aided by the fact that the traditional left-wing media whose job it once was to foster 'class consciousness' are now very much on the side of the well-heeled professional class.",True,False,False,,,0,1577876446,,1577876887,0,{},fcq129m,False,t3_ehhmq2,False,True,t3_ehhmq2,/r/TheMotte/comments/ehhmq2/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_december_30/fcq129m/,False,,1586475301,33,True,False,TheMotte,t5_vkedk,r/TheMotte,public,0,[],

It also redistributes some wealth from for example millionaires and billionaires, which for every extra 1$ earned, only added 0.40$ to the economy.

&gt; If one country is affected by negative shocks that call for, say, lower wages relative to other countries, that can be achieved by a change in one price, the exchange rate, rather than by requiring changes in thousands on thousands of separate wage rates, or the emigration of labour. The hardships imposed on France by its ""franc fort"" policy illustrate the cost of a politically-inspired determination not to use the exchange rate to adjust to the impact of German unification. Britain‚Äôs economic growth after it abandoned the European Exchange Rate Mechanism a few years ago to refloat the pound illustrates the effectiveness of the exchange rate as an adjustment mechanism.

&gt; Proponents of the euro often cite the gold standard era from 1879 to 1914 as demonstrating the benefits of a common currency. But the gold standard also had its costs. The period was characterised by declining prices from 1879 to 1896, rising prices thereafter, and sharp fluctuations within each period, especially severe in the 1890s. The standard was viable only because governments were small (spending in the neighbourhood of 10% of the national income rather than 50% or more as now), prices and wages were highly flexible, and the public was willing to tolerate, or had no way to moderate, wide swings in output and employment.

If you didnt think it was possible, why bring it up and say it would be interesting if it happened? Sounds like you're contradicting yourself now.

&gt; I think it's you who doesn't seem to understand what the US is or what it's Military is. There is no chance that Iran could ever reach a US carrier

Then why is the US carrier fleet afraid to even enter the Persian Gulf right now? Its docked out somewhere in the choppy waters of the Gulf of Oman

https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/23/us/politics/warship-iran.html

In the article, they give some bogus excuse for being there. They apparently dont wanna raise tension by sailing in the Persian Gulf, but thats never been an issue before. The reality is that they know if things went sour, that carrier is in serious danger, due to the geostrategic advantages Iran has in the shallow and narrow waters of the Persian Gulf. Irans entire coastline is littered with missile launchers that would cause serious headaches.

&gt; There is nothing in Iran's arsenal that could reach a carrier without being shot down.

Anti-ship ballistic missiles my friend. Look them up. The US navy admits they would struggle dealing with these. Now add dozens of anti-ship missiles being launched at them at the same time, along with drones, cruise missiles and torpedoes, and you have a recipe for disaster. Iran even has anti-radiation ballistic missiles. They would turn the US' naval fleets powerful radars into homing beacons. So the US would have to turn them off to stop being targeted, leaving them vulnerable to other attacks.

&gt; Iran's ""drones"" are little more than uprated commercial drones similar to what ISIS uses.

This comment alone shows how little you actually know about Iran. Comparing Irans drones to the ones ISIS buys off amazon....Do some research and come back before you say any more embarrassing things

&gt; The US doesn't care much about the Saudis or the Emiratis

Global economy does. Thats what will suffer as a result. Its about threatening to bring maximum pain as a form of deterrent.

&gt; And yes you'd cause an amazing humanitarian crisis. And you just broke the rules about wishing violence on civilians. Attacking desalination plants would violate Geneva conventions.

Well dont start a war with Iran if you want to avoid it. The US doesnt give a shit about the Geneva conventions. They supported Saddam as he was using chemical weapons against Iranians. They supported Israel as it was bombing Lebanese infrastructure in violation of geneva conventions. They supported terrorists in Syria who carried out acts of genocide against the population. They support Saudi Arabia as it blockades the entire country of Yemen where over 100,000 children alone have starved to death. Why should Iran play by the rules if no one else is?

&gt; Israel can defend itself very well. The Iron Dome blocks all incoming weapons.

Once again showing how surface level your knowledge is. Iron Dome only deals with small projectiles like the couple bottle rockets Hamas fires from time to time. They dont deal with ballistic missiles. And they cant deal with guided missiles that can change course mid flight. And they certainly cant deal with thousands of rockets being fired at once from the Lebanese border, overwhelming their defences. 

&gt; Yes and this would primarily hurt China and Asia, not the US.

Not sure if you realise that high oil prices hurts the entire world. the entire global economy is interlinked. If there is a recession in China, there is a recession in many other parts of the world. If China have to spend twice as much just keeping the lights on, they dont have much to spend on other exports (including US exports). If Europe have to spend twice as much to keep the lights on, that less money they can spend on US exports. Same applies to the rest of the world. The point is to give the US pause for thought. Its entire economic order is under threat if they attack Iran....so they best think wisely.

I do think it's possible, I just said it's not ""reasonably possible"". This is not an absolute statement either way. I think it would be interesting to see what would happen in such a case. I don't think it's likely to happen.

&gt; Then why is the US carrier fleet afraid to even enter the Persian Gulf right now? Its docked out somewhere in the choppy waters of the Gulf of Oman

&gt; https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/23/us/politics/warship-iran.html

Except it's not. It was in the Persian Gulf earlier this month. Carriers don't sit in one place and are generally constantly moving. They're never ""docked"" in open water and keep moving, even if it's moving in circles. (There's no fuel to use as the nuclear reactors are always running and generating steam to power the ships.)

https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/us-naval-update-map-dec-5-2019

Recently it left the Gulf again and headed for Asia and CVN-75 is replacing it.

You're believing the opinion of some journalist who is only a correspondent with the Pentagon and acting as if it's fact.

I'd also note that what's written in that article (where it's a quote from a commander) is quite accurate. There's no need to subject the ship to additional danger when there's no need for it. The ships launched from the carrier have full range over Iran from where they are.

&gt; Anti-ship ballistic missiles my friend. Look them up.

I'm aware of them. The carrier groups are designed to defend against anti-ship ballistic missiles. Whether they're advanced at all is a complete different story. I've seen zero things written about worry about Iran's anti-ship ballistic missiles, but more about China's. I'd take that to mean that the US isn't worried about them.

&gt; Global economy does. Thats what will suffer as a result. Its about threatening to bring maximum pain as a form of deterrent.

The US is in the process of decoupling from the global economy. Again, this doesn't affect the US much. The US is not heavily economically involved in the global economy. The global economy is a tool of US soft power, not something that powers the US economy.

&gt; Well dont start a war with Iran if you want to avoid it.

Iran would be the one to start the war here. Especially if there's nationalist jingos like yourself in the leadership.

&gt; Not sure if you realise that high oil prices hurts the entire world. the entire global economy is interlinked. If there is a recession in China, there is a recession in many other parts of the world. If China have to spend twice as much just keeping the lights on, they dont have much to spend on other exports (including US exports). If Europe have to spend twice as much to keep the lights on, that less money they can spend on US exports. Same applies to the rest of the world. The point is to give the US pause for thought. Its entire economic order is under threat if they attack Iran....so they best think wisely.

More nonsense that isn't based in fact. Recessions elsewhere are never exported into the US. US recessions hit the entire world.

What happened in 2008 was a flash in the pan and nothing was fixed, there was just trillions of phony money printed to allow people in power/those who would bear responsibility for societal collapse to ignore it and thus the public ignore it, the problem is still there, and its getting bigger and bigger by the minute. Eventually this money printing will no longer work as the boomers die off and there is no debt slave consumer class to continue buying shit, then the trillions of phony money will come home to roost, a loaf of bread will cost a trillion dollars.

The biggest reason I‚Äôm considering Porto is because the Portuguese teams, from numerous financial reports I‚Äôve read, are really debt laden.

&gt;We are a EU-based Arma 3 community with a desire to grow. In our operations we rely on planning, communication, teamwork and deployment of adapted military tactics. While we enjoy more realistic aspects of the game, it is important that this does not compromise the gameplay experience. As such, we do not adhere to any military structure in terms of ranks etc. as all members are considered equal.

&gt;Our passion comes from challenging missions where we have to fight for a victory, never losing track of player experience. We do not want an easy victory where it is impossible to fail. We want challenging and immersive scenarios with reactive and responsive AI. In order to achieve this, our mission makers utilize a custom mission framework and various scripts in addition to the standard assets.


## About our operations


* Dedicated server for main operations, training grounds available during non-mission hours.
* Two weekly premade operations, set in modern day or cold war-era.
* Wednesdays 19:00 CET (GMT+1) or CEST (Summer Time, GMT+2).
* Saturdays 20:00 CET (GMT+1) or CEST (Summer Time, GMT+2).
* Units we play as includes (but is not limited to) US Army, US Marines, Tier 1 Operators, British Armed Forces, Bundeswehr and Russian Armed Forces.
* We play mainly as infantry, with additional helo and/or IFV support.


## What we are looking for


&gt;Emotionally mature and teamwork-oriented players who are willing to learn and improve. It doesn't matter if you are a battle hardened veteran or completely new to ARMA, everyone is equally welcome.


## About trainings we offer


&gt;Every new member will receive mentoring to ensure his smooth transition into our unit. In addition we provide voluntary specialist trainings for certain combat roles such as: marksman / sniper, combat medic, heavy weapons specialist and helicopter pilots. If you want to improve or learn these roles, we offer you many opportunities to do so though training days and mentoring.


## Requirements


* You are at least 18 years old and you are able to respect and understand others in the unit, and give and take criticism for personal learning. We give everyone a chance to show what they are made of.
* TeamSpeak 3 Client
* A working microphone
* Legal copy of ARMA 3 (also, while not required, we strongly recommend the APEX DLC)
* Weekly attendance. However, as real life always comes first, not everyone can always make this. In this case, just post a Leave of Absence so that we know and can plan the operations accordingly.


## About mods


&gt;We, like many other units out there, use a collection of mods to improve and expand the base game. Some of these mods have been further customized to better suit our needs. Size of the modset is currently around 40 GB, and we use Arma3Sync to distribute and keep it synced.


## How to join


&gt;Fill an **[application](http://www.7th-ranger.com/armarecruitment)** on our website. Once a Recruiter has reviewed it, he will contact you through Steam and invite you to our Teamspeak to have a chat. If we are what you are looking for and vice versa, you will get further access to all the needed resources to be able to join our operations.

Is this your way of pointing out that [Jessie Smollet is half Jewish?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jussie_Smollett#Early_life)

Are you somehow trying to imply that hate crime hoaxes are a common occurrence in the Jewish community?

A few years ago, there was a wave of hate crime hoaxes against Jewish centers.

Over 1,000 anti-Jewish threat phone calls were made. Bomb threats and other types of threats.

[JCC Threat-Makers: 2 Years, 1,000 Calls](http://newobserveronline.com/jew-jcc-threat-makers-2-years-1000-calls/)

Turns out that 2 Israeli Jews were paid in bitcoin to create this wave of hate crime hoaxes.

[JCC Threat-Makers ‚ÄúPaid with Bitcoin‚Äù](http://newobserveronline.com/jew-jcc-threat-makers-paid-bitcoin/)

No law enforcement has determined who paid them. But who benefited?

A very likely suspect is the ADL (Anti-Defamation League).

This wave of over 1,000 hate crime hoaxes was used by the ADL to raise huge amounts of money.

The ADL also used it as a pretext to pressure Amazon to ban a bunch of books on Holocaust Revisionism.

source:

https://codoh.com/library/document/5330/?lang=en

When the Israeli Jews were caught, the ADL blamed the bomb threats on ""white hate"" rather than a Jewish hate crime hoax.

[ADL: Israeli Jew‚Äôs Bomb Threats against American Jews are ‚ÄúWhite Hate‚Äù](http://newobserveronline.com/adl-counts-jews-162-bomb-threats-against-jews-as-white-hate-crime/)

So that's the current world.

 There's so little **real** anti-Jewish hatred that the Jewish Supremacists have to manufacture it with fake ""anti-semetic"" hate crime hoaxes.

But what about the reverse? What's the state of Jewish hatred against whites?

Here's an American rabbi preaching that God has given Jews a mission to ""fix the world""? 

But what happens to people who don't want their country to be ""fixed"" by Jews? Exterminate! Every man, woman, child, and even the babies must be genocided.

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/dtx7zi/exterminate_an_american_rabbi_says_god_had_given/f6z9jbl?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x

This rabbi specifically states that the countries that must be genocided are American and most of europe (white majority countries)

Of course, this rabbi pays no penalty for promoting genocide of white majority countries. Why not?

You aren't allowed to discuss or protest when Jews express genocidal hatred of white gentiles (non-Jews).

It's one of the many signs that we live under a SJS (System of Jewish Supremacy)

But most people don't know this, because the concept of [""White Supremacy"" is used as camouflage to cover up the fact that we actually live in a System of Jewish Supremacy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/d4al5e/why_do_universities_push_the_myth_that_black/f0alnsj/?context=3)

The ADL (Anti-Defamation League) [was created in order to free a Jewish child rapist/killer,](https://www.ancreport.com/report/adl-is-mafia-connected-and-defended-pedophile-rapist-and-murderer-leon-frank/).

The ADL is a [Jewish Supremacy group masquerading as a civil rights group.](http://www.unz.com/runz/american-pravda-the-adl-in-american-society/)

[No.](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/20/scottish-independence-lord-ashcroft-poll) Only 15% of No voters listed the EU as one of their top 3 reasons for voting to remain in the UK. The significance of the EU in the Scottish referendum has been retroactively played up by the Scottish Nationalists in an attempt to undermine the 2014 vote.

&gt; Then, two years later, England and Wales decided to leave the EU against Scotland's explicit will

Over a million Scots voted to leave. And 13 million people in England voted to remain. It's not like Wales and England were unanimously leave and Scotland was unanimously remain. Scotland is just a region in the UK where more people voted to remain - so is London, and so is Manchester, and so is a large portion of Northern Ireland. It was a national vote. Splitting the country up like a pizza and saying 'this area was dragged out against its will' just demonstrates that you don't understand what a vote is. And I say that as someone who voted for remain.

&gt; So Scotland has to face all the bad side effects of Brexit, while itself has no fault in it. 

Scotland literally would have had to leave the EU anyway if it voted to leave the UK. Choosing to leave the UK would have had far worse consequences for Scotland than leaving the EU would. ]

And by the way, all of this shit? It's just stuff from like the last 5 years. Scotland has been in the UK for 300. Political alignments change. Just 10 years ago, the Prime Minister was Scottish.

[],,VisionGuard,,,,[],,,,text,t2_4ggp7yre,False,False,[],"I'll leave it to someone else to refer you to specific literature, but I think there are two reasons:  economics and US History.

The first somewhat dovetails from military doctrine, and predominantly BRITISH doctrine -- namely that if you are a non-eurasian power, then if you control every naval chokepoint in the world and hem in your rival power on the Eurasian landmass, you control the world and thus its economics, which controls destiny.  Note that this really only words for a power that ISN'T in mainland Europe or Asia.  A major part of US military expenditure is basically to have full control of sea-lanes -- the US Naval Air Force is the second largest Air Force in the world behind the US's ACTUAL air force.  This permits control over sea trade - which is how most goods are transported cheaply around the world - and also secures tons of allies who wish to participate in that world.  Contrary to popular belief on reddit and especially here, this world has actually been insanely GREAT in very specific economic respects for the most part that plenty have benefited from, with very few highly expensive skirmishes in the way that it used to exist prior to the US, predominantly because the US uses that massive Navy to guarantee that, say, tiny Norway can transport its oil all the way to China without molestation, and previously smaller in power China could do the same with its cheaply made goods.  Really the only way to accomplish this control in earnest if you're not in Eurasia is to basically plant yourself on BOTH sides of Eurasia in earnest - and thus the US is seated in Europe and Japan/SK/Taiwan/Australia/NZ with various military treaties.

The second is US History, and the underlying existential fear that every US war planner and defense secretary is either born with or bequeathed.  While plenty in the Old World argue repeatedly that the US is ""protected by their two oceans"" and thus is a war mongering fool, you'll note that there were three major existential type wars in the history of the US that could have potentially destroyed it as it stood - Revolutionary, Civil, and WWII.  You'll note that those could ALSO be viewed as ""Atlantic"", ""Americas"", and ""Pacific"" in ORIGIN.  In other words, the US has literally been attacked in both major directions and from within almost in sequence, from the Sea when its foreign, and with dire consequences for losing that war.  Because of that, at the end of WWII, when the US had a chance to have world wide possible hegemony, its military planners literally stated that they wanted to be able to fight two massive wars in two ""areas"" of the world at any given moment - but everyone knew the underlying coded message to the world was that they would be able to fight an Atlantic and Pacific war simultaneously.  This was the only way to ""secure"" the US and avoid the existential conflict that threatened the US since its origin.  Also note that many of the current ""allies"" of the US were literally the ones trying to destroy it, and the world, only 70 odd years ago - so as much as there's this idea of the US being some two-faced ally since Trump, they're nowhere near that when it comes to waging world-ending style war against its current allies the way it was in reverse.  Hence, the US does loathe to give up the security that comes with controlling the entire world's military and telling everyone to basically go back to their corners and DEFINITELY never attack it, because without it a massive, possibly world war may START due to internecine Euro/Asian squabbling like has happened since time immemorial.

I'm not suggesting any of the above is currently RATIONAL, but I can see why the dominos would fall the way they have.  And now that it's in place and so many stakeholders benefit from US worldwide hegemony - ESPECIALLY allies that currently sling mud at the US for political points - its very difficult to dismantle in some kind of win-win manner.",True,False,False,,,0,1577896382,,1577897073,0,{},fcr3u20,False,t3_eij92w,False,False,t3_eij92w,/r/geopolitics/comments/eij92w/whats_the_theoretical_justification_for_the_size/fcr3u20/,False,,1586493988,92,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,0,[],

This obviously has nothing to do with individuals but this is how your kind always deflects the broad picture regarding forced diversity, lowering of wages through decreased IQ and economic mobility and security, increase in crime, decrease in standards of living, happiness, societal trust, and you never will acknowledge the caustic effect diversity obviously creates, from the beginning of human history, when two groups of people butt up against each other, as a whole there has never been anything but conflict. Never harmony.   
You are the type that can take a room filled with a brit protestant, a french catholic, a german lutheran, a spainard catholic, a greek orthodox, an italian catholic, an irish pagan and a scott atheist and complain about too many white people in the room, and you will see a room filled with 8 Sunni Somalians from the same town and say 'wow! such awesome diversity!""

Point is, for two communities to co-exist peacefully and harmoniously there has to be significant trust and respect. In India, all the problems are papered over with thin layer of ""secularism"", there is no effort to build mutual trust. First step in building the trust is to put forward the differences and then find the a solution for them. You can not build trust until you address these differences.

In America you would be called a liar/fool/bigot and what not if you say that Native Americans and early European settlers peacefully co-existed since beginning and Native Americans were not systematically destroyed to the brink of extinction. Americans today recognize and accept this history and try to make amends by providing special rights to Natives (e.g. Native American settlements).

Now replace Native Americans with Hindus and European settlers with Muslim invaders and you get the feel of Indian history. Difference being that in India Muslims are given special rights and privileges (special minority rights provided by constitution, yes a 200 million strong group is minority) and Hindus have to act as if nothing happened. Any attempt of talk about history is suppressed; bigot, Hindu Nazis, Islamophobe become the labels for people raising these issues.  

Since independence these issues are not talked about which has led to the current situation, where most of the Indians are silent against the law which would marginalize 200 millions (these massive protests you are talking about are limited to few cities and driven by mostly Muslim crowd, there are massive rallies in favor of this law). And we are not still ready to talk.

If you're a patchwork of little states who are fiercely independent, what you worry about is that the new federal state you are forming will select a church and pick favourite among the former colonies. Therefore, you want the federal state to separate itself from religion. You are fine with the local state having a state church and the church opining about politics at all levels.

Because the phrase is catchy and covers an important principal, it has stuck. Because people don't look at context (we do the same with the Bible), that phrase it taken out of its historical context to imply that a state shouldn't interact or talk on religion (broken frequently) and that a church shouldn't interact or talk on politics (broken frequently).

I bought both full price years ago and enjoy alternating between them every so often. Don't get me wrong, I love driving in Europe, but ATS's world feels more unique and interesting. People say ATS is boring because it's all desert, but realistically a majority of Europe, and therefore ETS2 is forested with tree walls on each side of the highway. The west side of the US may be mostly arid, but since it's a wide-open area they had to put more detail in mountains and landscape around the driving locations and each road has its own interesting and unique bit of something to look at because they can't cop out and spam a tree brush to paint the world in trees. That's not to say there aren't unique things, because (not so much in vanilla locations like the God-awful UK) there are unique buildings, roads, and locations in ETS2 that are nice to see if you're familiar with the area, but the terrain between cities being so wide open necessitates the whole world be a unique experience that you can see for miles away since outside of Oregon and Washington right now there aren't a whole lot of densely forrested areas that can be covered in trees.

The journey they‚Äôve had to go through to get him to academy level is probably ten times the effort and money for children of African/Caribbean or English/European descent.

He has said that there is still a fundamental level of racism against SI children in football.

There's literally only enough hours in the school day to teach history. At some point you need to discriminate, and the War of 1812 is a perfect example. While important to the US, it was a minor sideshow to the Napoleonic Wars to the UK, and ended up with the status quo being respected, versus the entire power balance of Europe shifting.

Yes, the US went on to be a superpower, but how much time does the US curriculum spend on the British Empire, which completely shaped the modern world? If we should cover the Revolutionary War with undue importance, you should be covering Trafalgar and Waterloo too with the same focus.

In all honesty, we spend more time discussing the French Revolution than the American one, simply because it had far more impact on shaping us as a nation. 

The loss of America wasn't the seismic event at the time that people feel it was. It was seen as too distant and costly to effectively subjugate and govern again, so effectively abandoned as a project. There really wasn't a lot of bitterness at the time. It was seen more as a failed police action than war.

The far bigger loss at the time was one of pride. But conducting a foriegn war thousands of miles away in the 1700s was hardly easy in logistical terms.

[],,HoidTheWorldhopper,,,,[],,,,text,t2_4bvjq3u6,False,False,[],"Because I guess there are some concepts you probably can't understand that are present in most European languages. For example, in English you say ""it"" for an object and ""he/she"" for a person, but in for example Portuguese there is no neutral pronoun so you have to learn the correct pronoun for each object (table is a feminine noun for example, while shoe is a masculine noun). 

In german there are 3 words for ""the"", a neutral, a masculine and a feminine version of the article (der, die, das) but there are also 4 conjugations based on what your sentence is (Nominativ, Akkusativ, Dativ, Genitiv). So when you say ""the table"", it's Nominativ, so in German ""der Tisch"", but if you say I *clean* the table, it becomes Akkusativ: ""Ich (I) putze (clean) *den* Tisch"" instead of ""der Tisch"".


If you say I put the table on the floor, floor is masculine (der) but in this context, it must also be conjugated in the Akkusativ form: ""Ich stelle (put) den Tisch auf (on) den Boden (floor)"". 


However, if the table was already there and you're only describing where the table is, you say ""der Tisch (Nominativ, so it's ""der"" not ""den"") liegt (lies) auf *dem* Boden"". Here it's not ""der"" nor ""den"", it's ""dem"", because it's Dativ.


 But if you're talking about something that belongs to the table, for example ""the table's chair"" you say ""der Stuhl (chair) *des Tisches* "" because then its Genitiv and not Akkusativ or Nominativ or Dativ

I know it sounds complicated (and don't get me wrong, it is, especially when you don't have time to think about what you're saying) but there are some languages with a lot more than only those 4 cases, for example in Russian there are 6 cases and in Hungarian there are 18. In English there are 3, but since the only article is ""the"", the only time you notice the cases is when you have a personal pronoun (he/him/his). 

To help you visualize this, [here](https://images.app.goo.gl/e9uX5AbpSjAceCcb6) is a simple comparison between German and English articles it and [here](https://images.app.goo.gl/hrCn4t4gSXY82utV6) is how you find out if the noun is nominativ, akkusativ, dativ or genitiv.

 And that's only definite articles, if you also consider indefinite articles (in English ""a"", as in ""a table"" and not ""the table"") there are also [these](https://images.app.goo.gl/RQFWiVbtFuTKW3dE6)

Also to complicate things, if you use an adjective it must also be conjugated based on what case the noun it is referring to is. [Example 1](https://images.app.goo.gl/4QVdpgCpBcNYAVsA9) and [Example 2](https://images.app.goo.gl/xuYvi5DjaqVz9SuGA)

Doesn't mean that income in lower strata isn't seeing increase. If you look at real wage increase, it's better than it was during early 2000s which was better than pre liberalization. Income inequality is not worse off because incomes of only select few saw the rise while everybody else is at the same level as they were 2 decades ago like in the west but that income of many didn't see increase as quickly as income of some.

The keyword is high here. A capitalist system will have income inequalities, but the rich cannot get richer at the expense of poor. What we see now is large scale wealth transfer from the poor to the rich. If the trend continues, the top 0.01% will become so powerful that they'll run the world (if they're not already doing it). The welfare programs are treating the symptoms, not the cause.

I was literally just saying that it's damn fishy that disney makes up the reason for orange sabers to exist, then adds info about prophecy only to then have Rey appear with an orange saber. I feel like you took the wrong things from what I meant and applied a lot of assumptions about it.


If you knew what I meant when I was talking about non-kyber orange crystals, then why waste time pointing out that I was wrong about it being a book and not a comic.


Bringing up a cosmetic choice (that was an incentive to sell pre-orders) in a video game is disingenuous to compare to Disney having information in a book, leading up to the release of their movie in which their new main character happens to wield a lightsaber using the now cannon color. The lightsaber colors in Fallen Order don't have anything to do with Cannon at all. In Fallen Order you can have a purple blade, which in EU was literally a ""Rare"" kyber crystal that Mace Windu went out an found on a special planet, just like the crystals in M&amp;A.


Maybe Rey's blade isn't one of these new cannon crystal's. And maybe there being extra prophecy about the special crystals being for special people, doesn't apply to Disney's newest special space princess. Unfortunately if Disney does decide to make Rey some prophesied thing, we can't do dick about it.

&gt; Sinfonia Electronique is an international collective of European, Asian, and North American musicians who have again come together to interpret new musical works created by its members. Once more focusing on compositions by American musicians Richard Eppedio and C.R. Keyser-Posner, and featuring performances by a select group of kindred musical spirits from various stylistic backgrounds, Sinfonia Electronique continues to move forward while maintaining a backward gaze, ever mindful of those who have come before them and blazed an amazing trail of musical mastery, leaving a legacy these performers strive to keep alive in the twenty-first century.....and beyond.

-Catalunha should at least had the chance to democratically be asked if it wants independence or not, the vote wouldn't be binding but at least it would open the door to negotiation to resolve some of the issues and if the issues aren't able to be resolved then maybe advance to democratic attempt to alter the Spanish constitution and possibly get independence by peaceful means.


-Oliven√ßa is Portuguese nacional soil that Spain has invaded, Spain should either give it back or at least declare shared boards between the two in order to protect the interests of the people living there and then later on give it completely to Portugal.


-people should come to terms that EU is walking a path to federalism since its inspection, functionally it already almost works much like one, the Lisbon treaty and the treaty of the functioning of the European Union are derive from a fail project to create a European constitution the alterations from that fail project and the current treaty are minor changes and we really need a European constitution. Also its better for everyone, we avoid another European bloodshed wars, better economy and we can make front against the bipolarization of the world's politics ( exp: US vs China or US vs USSR etc).


-electricity should be free or almost free and should be financially supported by taxation.


-we should create an agreement to disband the military of the world, and only focus weapon development for the protection of the collective good of mankind (i know its impossible such thing its in our nature to be selfish and destructive but it would be nice thought).

However you have to ask, why would they do that? They would be at a largely underdeveloped, mostly uncultivated land isolated from their neighbours. The tribal leaders at the time considered Ottoman state as a protection from Shia Iran to east, where they were more vulnerable to being invaded from because of Zagros, it is not just Ottoman state they have to contend with militarily but also Iran. 

Also in the case of Afghanistan, when one of the clans there managed to capture Isfahan in Iran, they declared themselves Shahs of Iran promptly. Nationalist feelings you mention wouldn't be present anywhere except few poets until 19th century, even then it was particularly slow to reach Muslims of the area who felt more strongly about Islam than nations. The type of independent, nation-state of Kurdistan could only be possible during dissolution of Ottoman Empire with nationalist consciousness like how other states got independence during 19th and 20th centuries but even then Kurdistan's central position would have likely made it a colony to British who wanted to have control of Basra to reach India, similarly in how they wanted to control Afghanistan.

So in purely military terms, it is possible they could gain independence and maintain it but in geopolitical sense it was at the time either illogical or improbable with any success towards east likely incorporating them into Iran.

Easy Company is likely as MILSIM as it would get for you. They are filled with good people, who know the game well. (I personally am not a big fan of the use of Band of Brother's names there, but that shouldn't take away from how kind the people are)

The other MILSIM group I can recommend is the 505th. They are more relaxed compared to Easy, but still have a structure and basic requirements.

MILSIM aside, there are also a few other groups you should be aware of.

Team Dixx (US) has a discord environment that's much more socially relaxed, BUT they host regular events (sometimes 2x a month). These events are usually a mixture of fun/casual games (like their recent Machine Gun Massacre event) AND hardcore/competitive games against other organized groups (playing Hell Let Loose at a top tier level). I am personally responsible for Team Dixx's Hell Let Loose operations, so I might have a big of a bias here, but after being with these guys for 4 months, I've loved their social atmosphere and playing HLL with their community. 

Powerbits (EU) ALSO does competitive events on a regular basis, typically fighting against the Russians (the IMP and WSS clans). The Russians are currently known as the best in the world when it comes to this game. They are more organized and more disciplined than Western Players, so I give much respect to Powerbits for continually training against them. If you want a gut-wrenching game experience, you'll likely find it with them.

82AD (EU) has just started getting into competitive events, and are among the top respected HLL groups. Their structure is based around membership more than a ranking system, but their community is active and fun to be around. I personally love chatting with their leader, IronFi$t. He's a good leader, and runs their community and their HLL server well. Their community is good at teamwork and working together to accomplish tasks on the game. 


I know this info may have been more than you asked for, but I hope it helps you find a community you like. Hell Let Loose is a game that's made for social groups like the ones above.

The big-nosed-creep character is almost always a *Japanese* character, in context - the guy in that example is Japanese, not European at all. I specifically wanted to find one who wasn't European as an example. Bonus points that he's from a strongly and explicitly anti-fascist, anti-racist work (Metropolis).       

There is sometimes a similar thing with big-lipped-good-hearted-slowpoke archetypes that can... really look like they're drawing from American and European racist caricatures of black people in other media. There are *also* a bunch of character designs that *do* draw from American/European racist caricatures of black people. Mr. Popo is... pretty clearly one of those. Where this gets weird is that it can be done without racist intent - those caricatures were *everywhere*, and a lot of Japanese artists internalized the stylization without picking up on the contempt. It is pretty common to see designs like that for dark-skinned characters in 80s/early 90s media, but for those characters to also be presented affectionately. Which is not to say that it isn't problematic, but that it's problematic and weird.    

edit: Also, I think you'd like Eva if you like Akira and Ghost in the Shell. It's a similar thoughtful, dark, pessimistic near-future cyberpunk-y thing. It's very flawed and the attempts at humor... mostly fail (except when they're great? the power outage episode - not the one where they siphon all of Japan's power into a big laser gun, but the other one with the microorganism that infects their ""computers""... the fact that it felt necessary to distinguish that says something about this show - has a lot of charming bits and the second movie genuinely melts my heart at points)... but it's still interesting and worth watching.

I taught in the US for almost 10 years prior to that. It‚Äôs tough to generalize teaching abroad with regard to benefits and salary, since that really is dependent on the region you work in. Outside of Western Europe, most legitimate international schools provide a good salary, some kind of housing benefit (either provided housing or a stipend to cover local rent), health insurance, flights to and from your home of record at the beginning and end of each year, and tuition waivers for dependents to attend the school you work at (if applicable). You may also get a PD allowance as well. Retirement is generally up to you to plan, though some countries may have a pension plan you contribute to or some schools may contribute to a retirement plan for you in addition to whatever you save on your own. Contracts are typically for two years, with yearly renewals after that. 

The standard bar for entry is a valid teaching license, which you will have to keep active while you work overseas and at least two years of experience. If you have specialized curricular experience (like teaching AP classes or the IB program), then that‚Äôs an advantage. That said, the top tier schools are very competitive, and just having a license plus two years doesn‚Äôt entitle a teacher to get hired at the American School of London, which some new teachers seem to think. It‚Äôs much easier to get hired if you are open to any location; teachers who lock into one location (like France or Japan) tend to be disappointed because they invariably pick the most competitive countries to try to work in. That said, your teaching license is valuable and marketable, so you shouldn‚Äôt be looking for work at language centers or cram schools or entry-level TEFL positions.

I like teaching internationally, but you do have to do your own due diligence when it comes to researching schools. Some schools are great non-profit private schools, some schools are for-profit, but still reputable, and still others are for-profit and the family business, so you may deal with a lot of unethical behaviors to keep parents and students (customers) happy.  Some schools are actually international ( I worked at a K-12 school with 450 kids from 75 countries) and some are ‚Äúinternational‚Äù in name only, which means all local students except for teachers‚Äô kids. People usually prefer the former,

Someone on this sub said that teaching abroad doesn‚Äôt mean no problems, it means different problems, which is pretty accurate. But I‚Äôve found that by and large, you are still working in a school, and your day to day job responsibilities aren‚Äôt that much different from working in the US.

[],,hluzier52,,,,[],,,,text,t2_3dhvjjjd,False,False,[],"I don‚Äôt know if they have mentioned the ‚Äûhigh representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina‚Äú? He is basically an appointed ruler of BiH (short for Bosnia and Herzegovina) who has a lot of power. The high representative is there to ensure that the ethnicities of BiH don‚Äôt start killing each other again.

Now the good news is that war has become less likely over the years. The reason why is not that good: young people are leaving Bosnia. It‚Äôs an exodus, rarely seen before in history. Why do they leave? Corruption and bureaucracy. BiH has over 100 ministers and many local governments. Each of them has some range of authority over laws which makes it hard for someone who would like to start a business to do so.

The federal government is in a deadlock for years now. Why? If the federal government wants to do something, like change a law or start any reform process, all three ethnicities have to approve. This almost never happens. 

Than there is corruption. You might ask yourself how BiH transitionned from a socialist to a free market economy. I will try to explain it: During and after the war, BiH‚Äòs government owned companies were privatized. The high ranking officials and politicians bought those companies for almost nothing or just stole them. Then they sold everything that company had and fired all the employees. Corrupt politicians got rich, while the people got poorer and poorer. Mass unemployment and a traumatized, nationalistic population were the right mixture to end in disaster. Politicians would blame other ethnicities or the war for the problems of BiH.

After those people robbed the country, they asked the international community for financial aid - and the international community gave Bosnia more money per capita in aid than to any other country in history, yet this aid didn‚Äôt help the people that much. The money ‚Äûdisappeared‚Äú into some corrupt person‚Äòs bank account. 

Without any light of hope, young, well educated people see their future abroad. There are some schools that train those people to get a diploma that is only valid in other countries like Germany.

If you would ask people in Bosnia if the country should split up or remain united, many, many people will tell you that they don‚Äôt want to live with the other ethnicities. If you asked Croatians in Croatia and Serbs in Serbia what they would rather want to see: a united Bosnia or a unification with their ‚Äûfellow countrymen‚Äú, a vast majority would choose the latter. So: why does BiH still exist? Because the EU and the international community want them to exist. They know that a breakup would lead to a war and so do many Bosnians. So, instead of breaking up, they tolerate this country but they don‚Äôt like it and don‚Äôt believe in its future.

In 2050, BiH is expected to lose even more people and will probably have around 2.8 million people by that year.

&gt; Faber found during his more recent scholarly research with British Naval Office records that in 18th-century Britain, Jews actually were not heavily invested in the trading part of the slave trade. ‚ÄúOverwhelmingly,‚Äù Faber said, ‚ÄúJewish merchants and shippers were not involved at all; they represent a minuscule portion of owners of ships.‚Äù While Jews did own slaves, he found, ‚Äútheir ownership was directly proportionate to their numbers.‚Äù


&gt; The Secret Relationship¬†gives a false and distorted picture,‚Äù said David Brion Davis, Sterling Professor of History Emeritus at Yale University and author of a trilogy on slavery, the first part of which won the Pulitzer in 1967 and the second of which won the National Book Award in 1976. ‚ÄúOf course, some Jews were involved in the slave trade. Every European Western nation was.‚Äù There were also some regions in which the slave trade was more accessible to Jews‚ÄîRhode Island, Newport, Holland, to name a few striking examples. ‚ÄúThe Dutch Jews weren‚Äôt persecuted, so there were quite a few who were involved.‚Äù


&gt; Much of the historical evidence regarding alleged Jewish or New Christian involvement in the slave system was biased by deliberate Spanish efforts to blame Jewish refugees for fostering Dutch commercial expansion at the expense of Spain. Given this long history of conspiratorial fantasy and collective scapegoating, a selective search for Jewish slave traders becomes inherently anti-Semitic unless one keeps in view the larger context and the very marginal place of Jews in the history of the overall system. It is easy enough to point to a few Jewish slave traders in Amsterdam, Bordeaux, or Newport, Rhode Island. But far from suggesting that Jews constituted a major force behind the exploitation of Africa, closer investigation shows that these were highly exceptional merchants, far outnumbered by thousands of Catholics and Protestants who flocked to share in the great bonanza.


&gt; Davis continues:


&gt; To keep matters in perspective, we should note that in the American South, in 1830, there were only 120 Jews among the 45,000 slaveholders owning twenty or more slaves and only twenty Jews among the 12,000 slaveholders owning fifty or more slaves. Even if each member of this Jewish slaveholding elite had owned 714 slaves‚Äîa ridiculously high figure in the American South‚Äîthe total number would only equal the 100,000 slaves owned by Black and colored planters in St. Domingue in 1789, on the eve of the Haitian Revolution.


Bem√¶rk, at j√∏disk involvering i slavehandlen er almentkendt, hvilket dine halvd√•rlige kilder ogs√• bekr√¶fter. Hvad de ikke p√•viser, er at j√∏derne var ekstraordin√¶rt fremtr√¶dende. Men g√¶tter ikke p√•, at nuancer er din st√¶rke side. Det var det i hvert fald ikke sidst.


&gt; Jeg synes du skal fucke af din klamme j√∏diske slavehandler-apologet.


√Öh, hvor er I dog forudsigelige. At du fors√∏ger at t√∏rre slavehandlen af p√• j√∏derne er fejt, og m√• jo bero p√•, at du ikke hviler nok i din etniske og kulturelle identitet til at kunne kapere, at j√∏derne ikke st√•r bag alt negativt. Jeg har personligt ikke det problem,men modsat dig ser jeg s√• heller ikke fortidens synder som et fastt√∏mret etnisk karakteristika, s√• jeg t√¶nker hverken at j√∏disk involvering i slavehandlen ligger nutidige j√∏der til last, eller at vores fremf√¶rd i Vestindien er mit eller andre nulevendr danskeres problem.

In late 2014, I started seriously saying to myself ""i cannot do this"".

I flew around 200,000-250,000 miles a year.  I spent 50%+ of my nights in a hotel and ate the same percentage of meals in planes/restaurants/customer cafeterias.

I would be in many time zone - fly from the east coast to europe (5-6 hours), or asia (12+ hours).  I'd leave on a friday night - get to my destination on saturday.  Feel completely ill all day sunday.  Then speak at a conference, deliver an 8 hour seminar, or meet with a customer for a day or two listening to their issues and developing some solutions (worked in technology/software).  Do this hopefully in the same city - but many times fly out tues/wed night to another country and do some more.  Then, fly home friday.  Dealing with time zones again...

Worked at home the next friday-friday (week on the road, week off - had my kids 50/50 custody, they came over friday night and left the next friday morning for school and went to her house).

and repeat.

I started having heart issues after a few years of this - afib big time.  I was going to take time off to correct it, put in for a sabbatical (I was pretty sure the sabbatical would turn into retirement, but since I didn't have to pull that trigger - I didn't).

six weeks into the sabbatical - this happened to me: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5dp2kk/serious_how_have_you_almost_died/da6ee0p/

that sort of cemented it, I extended the sabbatical to a full year, but in november of 2015 - I officially resigned.

and haven't looked back :)

I don't travel at all now, except for a vacation with my now retired wife (she joined me this year in retirement).  I can self entertain myself pretty easily.  I don't miss hotels, airports, restaurants, customer sites, conferences (i got to hate those things actually - for the people attending, they are a big party - getting away from work - for me, it was work) and so on.  not even a tiny bit.

Do you even read what I write?

&gt; the British way to implement serfdom in India gave the land to people who had nothing to do with the land.

As if Indians before that had a fair system. Not really.

&gt; Destroying Indian industries

They weren't destroyed. Traditional Indian industries weren't competitive at the time. For example, textile production decreased not because the British harmed it. Europe, the biggest consumer, grew its own production like never before, Italy is a good example.

&gt; to make India a source of raw materials for British industries

Like it wasn't a source of raw materials before? That was one of the main things India sold to other countries before being colonized. You make it seem that the British hurt Indian economy, while under their rule it grew. Not only material exports happened, production overall was steadily rising, just as consumption.

&gt; Exporting food grain

And paying money for that. The British bought grains, what an awful thing!

On 10 May 1940, Germany launched *Fall Gelb* (Case Yellow) - the invasion of France and the Low Countries. The attack succeeded to an extent that exceeded even Adolf Hitler's wildest expectations. Within six weeks, France and the Low Countries had fallen and nearly all of the British Expeditionary Force was interned in German Prisoner of War camps (after a failure to evacuate by sea at Ostend). The shocking victory would see British Prime Minister Winston Churchill ousted in a cabinet revolt, and the new British government seeking an armistice with Germany. By September of 1940, the ""Polish War"" would be concluded. In addition to reclaiming Alsace Lorraine, Eupen-Malmedy, and North Schleswig, Germany made a number of small strategic annexations in the West, imposed limitations upon the French military, and required France to pay war reparations. However, in return for these gains - and tacit acceptance of Germany's annexation of Poland, the German Military withdrew from the West. Hitler had secured his western flank such that he could pursue his real aim: the destruction of the Soviet Union and the incorporation of European Russia's vast agricultural and mineral resources into the Nazi domain. After the final peace negotiations in the West had been concluded, Hitler ordered the German High Command to draft *Operation Barbarossa*: a plan to conquer the Soviet Union up to an ""Arkhangelsk‚ÄìAstrakhan line"" in 1941.  


Joseph Stalin, leader of the Soviet Union, quickly became aware of Hitler's intentions to attack East. Stalin had always assumed that Germany would be unable to attack the Soviet Union so long as her armies were tied down fighting France and the United Kingdom - which would give the Soviet military time to reorganize and rearm such that they could face the German threat. However, the unexpected sudden conclusion of the war in the West had upended Stalin's entire calculus. Germany would now be ready to attack the Soviet Union after the Spring Rasputitsa had concluded in 1941. Germany's actions after the conclusion of the Polish War made it patently clear to Stalin that Germany was gearing up to attack. Despite the conclusion of hostilities, Germany did not demobilize any of its army divisions. Additionally, Germany began to station troops in Finland and Romania, while commercial and non-aggression treaties were concluded with Yugoslavia and Greece (which secured Germany's southern flank).  


War games conducted in Red Army staff colleges almost universally indicated that the Red Army would suffer significant losses and lose significant territory with their current defensive echelon strategy if the Germans were to invade. Against this backdrop, General Georgy Zhukov, the victor of Khalkhin Gol, [proposed a preemptive attack to Stalin](https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/wi-stalin-strikes-germany-first-in-wwii.352431/#post-10682509). Arguing for a limited offensive into German Poland (as well as a spoiling attack into Romania), Zhukov believed that a surprise attack could destroy significant numbers of German formations on the border, which would inhibit the Wehrmacht's ability to attack the Soviet Union. While war game simulations suggested that Zhukov's proposed attack would often fail to gain much ground or inflict many casualties, compared to the defensive echelon strategy, the front-line at the end of 1941 was closer to the German-Soviet border. Stalin was never fond of gambling on Offensive actions he wasn't certain he could win, but he felt the strategic situation forced his hand. The Soviet Union needed time more than anything else, and even if the attack might fail, Zhukov's preemptive attack could buy the Soviets enough time to survive the German invasion Stalin knew was coming. With some reluctance, Stalin approved the plan, and the Red Army began planning to launch an offensive at the end of June.  


In May of 1941, German reconnaissance aircraft detected the first movements of Soviet offensive assets towards the German-Soviet border. While denied by the Lithuanian government-in-exile, Nazi Germany allegedly received supplemental intelligence from resistance fighters in the Lithuanian Activist Front confirming this movement. The O*berkommando der Wehrmacht* (German High Command ) was now presented with a dilemma. Should the present offensive *Barbarossa* plan be maintained? or should the plan be scrapped in favor of a defensive posture? While many German generals, such as Heinz Guderian, argued that the best way to defeat the Soviets was to launch a preemptive attack - even if it meant moving the timetable for *Barbarossa* forward, more cautious elements within the OKW prevailed (as there was significant concern that the swollen river conditions would not allow the *Barbarossa* attack to be undertaken until too late), and *Operationsplan Siegfried* was drafted. Under the *Siegfried* plan, German infantry would hold prepared defensive positions, while the Panzer groups would be used as mobile reserve to smash any Soviet breakthroughs. Operating under the assumption that the Wehrmacht could inflict a casualty ratio equal to or greater than the Finnish inflicted upon the Red Army in the Winter War, it was believed that after two months of fighting, the Soviets would be worn out, which would allow a German advance to the D√ºna and Dnepr rivers before the onset of winter. The German Army would build up from that position over the winter, and launch a decisive campaign in the Summer of 1942.  


As it represented a significant scaling down of his *Barbarossa* plan, Hitler refused to accept the cautious plan, and immediately ordered the OKW to draft a new plan. While the OKW worked on a new draft of *Siegfried*, Hitler conferred directly with his favorite general, Erich von Manstein, to see if the mastermind of the Fall of France had any brilliant plans to achieve victory in the East. Within a few days, von Manstein presented his F√ºhrer with the rough outline of a plan: ""the backhand blow."" Hitler fell in love with the plan immediately, and ordered the OKW to prepare an operational version of the plan.  


The premise of the ""backhand blow"" was simple. Germany would allow the Soviets to attack first. German infantry formations were concentrated in prepared strong points known as *Widerstandsnest* (""Resistance Nests""), which were located astride the expected paths of any Soviet offensive action (but at least 20-30 miles from the border). Attacking these strong points in German Poland would tie down much of the Red Army in place. The German Panzers, assembled in launching-off points a few miles behind these strong points, would not be used as mobile reserve as in *Siegfried*. Rather, after waiting for the Soviet attack to get bogged down, the Panzers would smash through Red Army lines, and conduct a deep double-envelopment. Encircled, and cut off from supply lines, nearly all of the entire strength of the Red Army would be destroyed on their forward positions in a modern Cannae. From there, the German Army could advance almost unopposed towards the key cities of Leningrad, Moscow, and Rostov-on-Don. While some within the OKW were concerned that the plan was too ambitious, ""the backhand blow"" was formally drafted as *Operationsplan Sonnenwende* (Operation Plan Solstice), and received Hitler's enthusiastic approval.  


The Soviet attack (known as Operation Star) would occur on 30 June 1941. While making decent progress on their first day, the Soviets advanced stalled as soon as they encountered the first *Widerstandsnests*, with the Red Army suffering significant casualties*.* The Red Army sustained particularly large losses among their tanks, which were interspersed throughout their infantry formations, rather than concentrated in mobile units. Hoping to sustain offensive pressure across the front to break the German lines, Zhukov ordered Soviet reserves committed on 2 July 1941. The German strong-points continued to hold, though a few days into the attack, some infantry formations were beginning to be exhausted by the Soviet offensive, and the OKW was worried that some-strong points might soon break under the pressure of the sustained Soviet advance.  


As consequence, on the night of 4 July 1941, the codeword ""Dortmund"" was transmitted to field headquarters of all of the Panzer Groups. The following morning, *Operation Sonnenwende* would be launched.",True,False,False,,,0,1577916730,,False,0,{},fcshp2t,True,t3_eionq5,False,False,t3_eionq5,/r/imaginarymaps/comments/eionq5/operationsplan_sonnenwende_des_okh/fcshp2t/,False,,1586517826,15,True,False,imaginarymaps,t5_2vqof,r/imaginarymaps,public,0,[],

Hurry up! The number of vehicles is limited!To the AuctionCIS | Europe | North America | Asia The Auction offers you an opportunity to purchase rare vehicles. The main feature of the Auction is that the vehicle prices are lowered every day, but the amount of vehicles is limited, so they might go out of stock at any moment. Don't miss this chance to add rare vehicles to your collection!How does the Auction work?The Auction is held in three stages. At the beginning of the first stage, only some of the lots will be up for sale‚Äîfive vehicles, to be exact. For the next stage, another five tanks will become available for purchase, while the original lots will be removed within an allotted time period, even if they haven't sold out. And after that, this scenario will repeat once again. You'll always find the list of vehicles available for purchase on the Auction page.Here are the lots of the third stage!Lots for January 1‚Äì9Attention: On January 9, the Auction will close!The T28 Defender and IS-3 Defender{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/26494313/ac1963ce51747e1ab127c7ea3bc6985c1cf1d9d1.jpg{STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/26494313/1c9cb7c31c393f02c09b4347d8557e9d213a63f0.jpgDespite their names, these vehicles will perform great not only on the defense, but on the attack as well.

Hylurgopinus rufipes, known as the native elm bark beetle, is a species of elm bark beetles in the tribe Hylesinini (crenulate bark beetles). It is found in Canada and US. It is of particular importance as a vector of Dutch elm disease. It is brownish-red in color and its size ranges from 2.34 mm to 2.9 mm.

***

**Scolytus multistriatus**

Scolytus multistriatus, the European elm bark beetle or smaller European elm bark beetle, is a bark beetle species in the genus Scolytus. In Europe, while S. multistriatus acts as vector of the Dutch elm disease, caused by the Ascomycota Ophiostoma ulmi, it is much less effective than the large elm bark beetle, S. scolytus.

S. multistriatus uses vanillin and syringaldehyde as signals to find a host tree during oviposition.

***

**Scolytus schevyrewi**

Scolytus schevyrewi, the banded elm bark beetle, is a 3‚Äì4 mm long elm bark beetle species in the genus Scolytus native from Asia and accidentally introduced to North America. It is a vector of the Dutch elm disease, caused by the Ascomycota Ophiostoma ulmi and Ophiostoma novo-ulmi. In North America, it is displacing both the native elm bark beetle and the previously introduced smaller European elm bark beetle, which are becoming less common in their range with the expansion of S. schevyrewi.

The United States of America (USA), commonly known as the United States (U.S. or US), the States or simply America, is a country comprising 50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories, and various possessions. At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km2), it is the world's third or fourth-largest country by total area and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe. Most of the country is located in central North America between Canada and Mexico. With an estimated population of over 328 million people, the U.S. is the third most populous country.

**White people**

White people is a racial classification specifier, used mostly and often exclusively for people of European descent; depending on context, nationality, and point of view. The term has at times been expanded to encompass persons of Middle Eastern and North African descent (for example, in the US census definition), persons who are often considered non-white in other contexts. The usage of ""white people"" or a ""white race"" for a large group of mainly or exclusively European populations, defined by their light skin, among other physical characteristics, and contrasting with ""black people"", Amerindians, and other ""colored"" people or ""persons of color"", originated in the 17th century. It was only during the 19th century that this vague category was transformed in a quasi-scientific system of race and skin color relations.

**Greek language**

Greek (Modern Greek: ŒµŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫Œ¨, ellinik√°) is an independent branch of the Indo-European family of languages, native to Greece, Cyprus, Albania and other parts of the Eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea. It has the longest documented history of any living Indo-European language, spanning at least 3500 years of written records. Its writing system has been the Greek alphabet for the major part of its history; other systems, such as Linear B and the Cypriot syllabary, were used previously. The alphabet arose from the Phoenician script and was in turn the basis of the Latin, Cyrillic, Armenian, Coptic, Gothic, and many other writing systems.

**Caucasus**

The Caucasus  or Caucasia  is an area situated between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea and mainly occupied by Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Russia. It is home to the Caucasus Mountains, including the Greater Caucasus mountain range, which has historically been considered a natural barrier between Eastern Europe and Western Asia.Europe's highest mountain, Mount Elbrus, at 5,642 metres (18,510 ft) is located in the west part of the Greater Caucasus mountain range. On the southern side, the Lesser Caucasus includes the Javakheti Plateau and grows into the Armenian highlands, part of which is located in Turkey.The Caucasus region is separated into northern and southern parts ‚Äì the North Caucasus (Ciscaucasus) and Transcaucasus (South Caucasus), respectively. The Greater Caucasus mountain range in the north is mostly shared by Russia and Georgia, as well as the northernmost parts of Azerbaijan.

Rev isn't the best audio or the highest pay, but it's easier for beginners to jump into because it has its own editor, rather than you having to worry about buying your own software. I made over $200 on Rev alone last month, and I didn't do anything with it most days. I took on a couple of big files that were an hour or two long where the whole thing paid $60 or $70. You get to pick through the queue and decide for yourself what audio you want to work with, some of it is shitty and some of it is clear. You can preview the file before claiming, or if you're in a rush to grab it before someone else does, you can unclaim it within an hour or so without a penalty if the file isn't something you want to work with. On the forums, the owner of the company recently said many of the workers were Eastern Europeans, though when someone asked if any users present were Eastern European, I didn't see anyone chiming in. But it's very possible the owner knew there are a lot of Eastern Europeans based on users' IPs, as well as the new requirements to add an address (I am not sure if this requirement is US-only or not, they recently banned workers from the state of California due to a new law in California) and that Eastern Europeans either weren't doing unpaid socializing on the forums, or didn't feel like announcing themselves. At any rate, Europeans are allowed on Rev, I can say that much.

But my best advice here is honestly to experiment for yourself. Try a site, and if you aren't getting what you want there or just feel curious, try a different site. There are lists of transcription companies all over this sub, I can't add much to those because I only tried one so far myself, though I do intend to grow that over time as I see what works for me. See how long it actually takes you to transcribe stuff. See what things make audio worse or better for you personally. Individual transcriptionists have preferences. You'll hear all kinds of accents: American, British, Australian, Indian, several Asian ones, and more. There will be regional differences in all of those. Because I'm American, I find American accents easy, including regional stuff and AAVE, and I'm pretty good with Latin American accents as well. Some non-Americans find that stuff really challenging, but do fine with Australian accents I personally would not claim. You'll learn what types of difficult audio are easier or harder for you to work with. Some people hate stuff like chewing/eating sounds in the recording, others don't care. Pay attention to how much time you actually spend on it, and what speeds you up or slows you down. Read tips and tricks like text expanders and audio filters/post-processors, and see if any of those help you. Basically, just play around with it, worst case scenario you get a little pay for something that was a bit too much trouble to do on a regular basis, best case scenario you find something that works for you. I think covering your rent with transcription is completely achievable, but I can't promise it would be doable in a time frame that's workable or worthwhile for you.

The American Jewish Committee took a survey showing that 80% of Jews polled have seen an increase in Anti-Semitism in the US, and 43% say they've seen a significant increase.  That's almost identical for the statistics of Jews in Europe.

The ADL also showed a 150% increase in Anti-Semitic incidents in 2018 vs. 2013.

While Jews agree that Democrats need to do more to call out Anti-Semitism, the vast majority of Jews in the US blame Trump and the Republican party for the increase (89% blame the far right for the increase).

Where I'm from, southern Europe, *universities have more status*. They pride themselves on doing *research*, *publishing*, being bigger and have a more international presence (classes taught in English, well-known faculty from big universities abroad, etc.).

They also offer a *wider selection of degrees*, like medicine; nursing; engineering; science; math; teaching...

*Colleges will still give you a degree*, BS, BA, BSc or MSc, even a Ph.D. They are smaller, and usually more focused (i.e. business colleges). Some colleges here, business schools, in particular, outrank universities for the same programs in international rankings and are very well renowned.

This could be a local thing though, as you can't normally get financing when studying a program that isn't accredited, and the facility won't receive government funding either. So most 'real' schools will give a bachelor's degree at least.

The only stuff I see that isn't accredited, and thus pricey (but shorter/part-time and no degree) are like 3/6 month courses leading to a diploma in dental assistance, 'front end web dev', travel or secretary work. Think coding boot camps, just a bit more old school.

**What do you want to do?**

It depends on what you want to do too. For some companies, it may be more important which university/college you got the degree from, as they have graduate programs and recruit directly from certain facilities.

I might be an idiot, but I also doubt that **undergrad programs (in content) vary that much between different schools**. The curriculum seems pretty standardized ... You can check out the curriculum from any university/college for i.e. Calc I/II/III and it's really all the same.

I just have a hard time believing that learning Calculus, Physics or basic CS (BS level) from ACME college or MIT is ""that"" different. Those classes don't change. I used a 30-year-old calc book my grandfather had because I didn't want to blow $100 on some book ... and the calculus I learned worked just as well. I even used it for work and the math was as good as it was back when the old wise grey-haired people in the 1600s penned it.

Though, a 'fancier' institution may give you a better network and connections, and more status + easier to get into postgrad programs. But if you have to pay for it yourself, meh, it pick any hole in the wall college and learn the basics, get a BSc, and then apply for a nice uni if I really wanted to go in-depth.

I took a BSc from a university -- but not in CS -- petroleum engineering and geological engineering. In CS I'm 100% self-taught, and I have no issues in life or coding-wise.

KERATOSIS PILARIS;   aka ‚ÄòChicken Skin‚Äô.

Keratosis Pilaris is usually a minor deficiency of vitamin A. 

Take 5,000 iu of vitamin A (pre-formed Retinol) or a tablespoon 

of cod liver oil every day for 90 days. 

This is common knowledge and the usual treatment in Europe. 

If you are dark skinned, the cod liver oil is better as it contains vitamin D as well as A. 

Most dark skinned people in the Northern latitudes are marginally vitamin D deficient, 

and D and A are in sync. No improvement will be observed in less than 28 days 

as this is time it takes for basal cells to reach the epidermis, the top layer of the skin. 

And this needs to occur 3 times for softer skin.

This is not a fact because this is not happening. Nobody is reporting anything any differently because they feel less safe about anything. This is what happened in Europe after the Danish cartoon controversy when people were actually scared of publishing things.

&gt;No. Government should be transparent. It wasn't ""Trump"", a person, it  was ""the President of the US"", the head of state and head of government.  They have a responsibility to keep the public informed, which is what  media is for.

Who cares? It was still his press conference because he is the President. This happens all the time, and the Court ultimately said that he couldn't exclude the press firms he wanted to exclude anyway. Nobody cares how it happens in Germany.

Your question is PT 69 LR I Q 19

&gt; The goblin fern, which requires a thick layer of leaf litter on the forest floor, is disappearing from North American forests...

So let's get the basic structure

* Premise 1: The goblin fern requires thick layers of leaves on the forest floor
* Premise 2: The goblin fern is disappearing from North American forests
* Premise 3: In those places where it has recently disappeared, the leaf layer is thin
* Premise 4: Also in those places, there are many of a type of European earthworms
* Premise 5: This type of earthworm eats leaves on the forest floor
* Conclusion: The worm is probably (&gt;50%) the cause of the disappearance

This is a ""necessary assumption"" question.  For these, you usually must read all the answer choices, because there are an infinite number of necessary assumptions.  Fortuntely, you only need to pick from among 5.

* (A) States that wherever there are leaves on the forest floor, this fern appears.  This is clearly not necessary.  It's no problem to have leaves without ferns.
* (B) This addresses the origin of the worms.  This is probably an issue in conservation in real life, but is totally irrelevant here.
* (C) Says, where ferns have recently died, a greater percentage of the dead leaves are from the fern.  This may be true, but need not be true.  Perhaps these leaves are eaten instantaneously by another animal right when they die.  In fact, the stimulus uses the word ""vanished.""
* (D) Says that you can't have both worms and ferns in the same place.  This is tempting, because it makes it sound like it's saying the worms always kill the firms.  But this actually contradicts the conclusion, because the conclusion relies on the two being in the same place so the worms an eat the leaves on the ground causing the fern to die.
* (E) Says the worm doesn't favor leaf layers thinner than the fern requires.  This must be true.  Because if the worms required thinner leaf layers than the living ferns, the worms could not hurt the ferns easily, since the worms would rather go somewhere other than where the leaves are thick on the ground, which is where the ferns are.  The only real difficulty here is the word ""favor.""  But the direct issue is that if they *did* favor thinner leaves, then it is *more likely* that something else caused the layer of leaves to become thinner, which killed the ferns, which then allowed the worms to move in.",True,False,False,,,0,1577933597,,False,0,{},fct5rou,False,t3_eikdzd,False,True,t1_fcsi5ad,/r/LSAT/comments/eikdzd/negation_test/fct5rou/,False,,1586529296,1,True,False,LSAT,t5_2qsf8,r/LSAT,public,0,[],

Example being the average middle class black man in New York  has more in common with a middle class white man in California than a man in Africa because they are part of the same culture. And most black people above the poverty line act the exact same as white people above the poverty line so they will get along just fine

When it comes to poverty African Americans are at a higher rate of poverty mostly due to slavery and racist laws in the mid 1900s so you will see more poor black people acting irate (stealing shot like that) and generalize them as not getting along with white people because of diversity problems but as I‚Äôve said African Americans have been sharing the same culture for 300 years so it‚Äôs not that

That wasn't the point that I brought to the forum's attention. You stated multiple things. 

One thing you stated was: ""it's not like we all come from the motherland of Caucasia."" in which, if you are referring to Caucasians, then they *literally* did and that is why they are called *Caucasians*. 

&gt;
&gt;You're conflating the broader grouping of people with features that kinda sorta resemble those of people originating from the caucassus mountains with the recent, American invention of 'white' people.

Those two things are already commonly conflated and have nothing to do with me personally. 

Is ""white people"" an invention of the Americans?

[""The term ""white race"" or ""white people"" entered the major European languages in the later 17th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people?wprov=sfla1), in the context of¬†[racialized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racialization)¬†[slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery)¬†and unequal¬†[social status](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_status)¬†in the European colonies. Description of populations as ""white"" in reference to their skin color predates this notion and is occasionally found in¬†[Greco-Roman ethnography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Roman_ethnography)¬†and other ancient or medieval sources, but these societies did not have any notion of a white, pan-European race. Scholarship on¬†[race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_categorization\))¬†distinguishes the modern concept from pre-modern descriptions, which focused on physical complexion rather than race.""


The correct answer is: no. 


&gt;But none of that matters because your article notes that the primary classification DOES NOT focus on skin tone but phrenological basis (IE: the skull, something last taken seriously as an aspect of racial science before Jules Verne was imagining we'd get to the moon in a giant bullet fired from a giant fucking gun)

You left out the part where phenotypes and skeletal anatomy are also major factors in the Caucasian designation. Also, there is a distinct difference between phrenology (skull-based psychology) and ""cranial measurements for the classification of race.""

""In¬†[biological anthropology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_anthropology),¬†Caucasoid¬†has been used as an umbrella term for¬†[phenotypically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype)¬†similar groups from these different regions, with a focus on skeletal anatomy, and especially cranial morphology, without regard to¬†[skin tone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_tone).""

I also did not argue that skin tone was important factor in deciding race. Does someone race change when they get a sun tan? Or when they use products to lighten their skin? 


&gt;I'll just leave this here from the thing you left here as well;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Since the second half of the 20th century, physical anthropologists have moved away from a typological understanding of human biological diversity towards a genomic and population-based perspective, and have tended to understand race as a social classification of humans based on phenotype and ancestry as well as cultural factors, as the concept is also understood in the social sciences. **Although Caucasian / Caucasoid and their counterparts Negroid and Mongoloid have been used less frequently as a biological classification in forensic anthropology (where it is sometimes used as a way to identify the ancestry of human remains based on interpretations of osteological measurements), the terms remain in use by some anthropologists.**

FTFY. 

Let me also leave another 'thing' from the article for you to digest. 

""Among the earliest¬†[anatomically modern human](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomically_modern_human)¬†settlements established in Europe were¬†[Kostenki-Borshchevo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kostyonki,_Voronezh_Oblast),¬†[Voronezh Oblast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronezh_Oblast)¬†in southwestern¬†[Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia).¬†[DNA sequencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing)¬†of a 37,000-year-old male skeleton from the area, Kostenki XIV or Markina Gora, indicates that these early settlers possessed a similar genetic makeup as modern Europeans, but had dark skin and dark eyes. They also possessed slightly more¬†[Neanderthal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neanderthal)¬†genes than modern populations in Europe and Asia due to interbreeding with Neanderthals over 45,000 years ago.¬†In a study of Cro-Magnon crania, Jantz and Owsley (2003) have noted that these ""Upper Paleolithic crania are, for the most part, larger and more generalized versions of recent Europeans.""

Facing the draft, the Army offered me a way I'd never see Nam and an officer's commission to sign up to their intelligence corps. It would've involved one year of Russian only training, but five years. I opted for draft, where they yanked me out of grad school in early 1969 when it was a nightmare, with Johnson already announcing we would withdraw, and more Americans were killed after Johnson saying we'd pull out than before (but certainly better than being a Jew in Europe 1945), but they were sending any male who could walk into combat as support for war had collapsed 100%. Fortunately, despite the nightmare of basic where the sergeants, all Viet vets, loved to tell us the many ways we'd die over there, I lucked into a non-Vietnam slot and got an honorable discharge. but didn't return to graduate school. Lost my Russian. Totally fluent in Spanish. Life is funny.

But I do read a lot of history, and want to be civil. I read voraciously in history, a lot of WWII. I asked politely and you only insulted me. Instead of going through a bunch of books, a quick Wiki search says that I was 100% correct in the Finns refusing to advance beyond their old territorial border and didn't do much to Leningrad except. cut off its northern approaches, and stayed quiet for the next three years. Therefore, Finns did not, as you claim, participate in the butchery of Leningrad. WIKI:

""By August 1941, the Finns advanced to within 20 km of the northern suburbs of Leningrad at the 1939 Finnish-Soviet border, threatening the city from the north; they were also advancing through East Karelia, east of Lake Ladoga, and threatening the city from the east. The Finnish forces crossed the pre-Winter War border on the Karelian Isthmus by eliminating Soviet salients at Beloostrov and Kirjasalo, thus straightening the frontline so that it ran along the old border near the shores of Gulf of Finland and Lake Ladoga, and those positions closest to Leningrad still lying on the pre-Winter War border.

According to Soviet claims, the Finnish advance was stopped in September through resistance by the Karelian Fortified Region;[40] however, Finnish troops had already earlier in August 1941 received orders to halt the advance after reaching their goals, some of which lay beyond the pre-Winter War border. After reaching their respective goals, the Finns halted their advance and started moving troops to East Karelia.[41][42].""

I won't insult you in return but your statement was ludicrous. I asked you to back it up, claiming I hadn't read as much on Finland's role in Barbarossa as on Germany and its other allies. I was genuinely curious, wondering how I had missed it, and again, wondering why Stalin had been relatively gentle on Finland if it actually invaded Russia proper.

Those old documents released since fall of USSR show that Stalin and others were really Communist, that they discussed in private meetings that were recorded or with extensive official notes that they were since Communists who wanted to extend it worldwide. Stalin against hapless Allies extended Communism into Czechoslovakia, for goodness sakes, along with East Germany and rest of Eastern Europe. After WW2, would the US or UK do anything if he sovietized Finland? Esp if it were involved in atrocities? 

But Stalin, who was determined to retake as much of tsarist Russia as he could, and even took all of Eastern Europe, left Finland mostly alone, long as it stayed neutral. And partially, it seems, because Finland committed no war crimes in joining with Hitler, did not savage Leningrad as you falsely claimed.

For the next three years, the Finns did little to contribute to the battle for Leningrad, maintaining their lines.[43] Their headquarters rejected German pleas for aerial attacks against Leningrad[44] and did not advance farther south from the Svir River in occupied East Karelia (160 kilometres northeast of Leningrad), which they had reached on 7 September. In the southeast, the Germans captured Tikhvin on 8 November, but failed to complete their encirclement of Leningrad by advancing further north to join with the Finns at the Svir River. On 9 December, a counter-attack of the Volkhov Front forced the Wehrmacht to retreat from their Tikhvin positions in the River Volkhov line.[2][4]""",True,False,False,,,0,1577936917,,False,0,{},fcta13d,False,t3_eihpqm,False,True,t1_fct1ibf,/r/wwiipics/comments/eihpqm/a_finnish_snowmobile_during_the_continuation_war/fcta13d/,False,,1586531362,3,True,False,wwiipics,t5_2tb0j,r/wwiipics,public,0,[],

Lots to unpack here.

For one, I just want to say that the differences between the US and France when it comes to topics like multiculturalism, immigration, assimilation, secularism, race, and ethnicity are interesting and more nuanced than what you are portraying. In fact, a miniature version of this Anglo Franco cultural clash happens in Canadian politics. Both sides call each other racist and claim the others‚Äô policies and ideas do more harm than good. However, both POVs have their merits and are trying to solve roughly the same problems using different approaches. The conversation is bigger than I will delve in this comment, but I will recommend two podcasts if you are interested in this.

Code Switch is an American podcast talking about race relations in the US and one episode, [We Don‚Äôt Say That](https://pca.st/episode/49bdb065-47f1-42d6-8ced-18cb23db5f39) talks about how race is viewed in France. On the flip side, the Phileas Club is a French podcast about cultural differences between not just nationalities but also politics and subcultures.

As to the rest of the first paragraph, I can understand the perspective but I do think it is somewhat unfair that almost all the differences listed are negatives or perceived negatives.

I can totally understand why you would feel that former French colonies feel less alien. It could be due to French influence, but I also think it could be something else.  I think it‚Äôs exposure. It is possible that Senegal is more different than Poland but you have so much more exposure to Senegal that it feels less distant.

As for Latin America, I find that even more interesting. I‚Äôm Colombian myself but I grew up in Northern America. I‚Äôve always viewed Latin America as close to USA socially (at least the closer ones) but that could just be my bias since I am at the intersection of both so both seem familiar and it‚Äôs easier to see the similarities. It also helps that there are like, 55 million or so Latinos in Anglo-America so the Venn Diagram has a big overlap. I‚Äôm not even joking when I say 1 in 10 US Americans are also Mexican and 1 in 4 Mexicans are also US Americans. And that‚Äôs not even to say anything of Puerto Rico, where the US flag literally flies over. I will say this though, most Latin Americans I meet online seem to hate NA and relate more to Europeans.

Reasonable wealth taxes should be able to be dealt with by having relatively low withdrawal rates.

So, T1 and DRX won. T1 had better drafts and jungle/mid synergy, nice series overall. Damwon was disappointing, played like S9 and couldn‚Äôt snowball a 3 kill Akali into anything, DRX showed no weakness. -1.5U

¬∑ **LoL, LEC, Rogue in Playoffs (1.61, 15U, Pick of the Year) (end of January ‚Äì middle of March)**

So this line didn‚Äôt move yet and I decided to hammer it even more. Rogue added their academy roster after the last place in Spring season and became a middle of the pack team right away. At the end of the season they were considered a top4 team entering playoffs, sweeping Splyce 3:0. Next round was a 1:3 loss to Schalke, they mental boomed after Larssen threw away game 3 with a Corki package into the fountain. Because of their Spring season, they were denied the Regionals and therefore Splyce moved into worlds with many people claiming RGE were the 3. best team in EU by now. Jungler Inspired won the Rookie of the split with Midlaner Larssen being the runner up. Both around top3 in their roles. Finn in the Toplane was also no slouch, having 2 Game MVPs but performing worse vs more experienced laners. The amazing thing is, they did this with 2 of the 3 worst ADCs in Europe (although Woolite stepped up in playoffs). Oldie Support Vander was fine, also having some MVP carry performances.

They added prodigy ADC HansSama to their roster, once hailed as the 2. best ADC in Europe. Misfits superteam failed, so he had to move into the academy team. He was the only player from the main roster to get his starting place back and had GREAT games despite the shit team around him.

So we have a top4 team from last season, which only ‚Äúfailed‚Äù because of their ADC and unexperienced rookies. They hard upgraded their only weak spot and now have one season of experience and more built up synergy. Many people rank them right below G2 and FNC at 3. In order to get into playoffs, they only need a 6. place (out of 10).

Imo this line is a joke, there is no way 6 teams are stronger than this lineup. Should be at 1.20 or something

¬∑ Im going to put a decent amount into T1 ML (line moved hard, try to find something with at least 1.5) and DRX -1.5 for the KESPA Cup, writeup will follow at matchdays.

Also, Im on twitter (VrsaiLoL), not much going on yet, but I will try to post some live bets there soon. Maybe alrdy at the weekend.

**Article**:

&gt; MONSEY, N.Y. (AP) ‚Äî F or years, ultra-Orthodox Jewish families pushed out of increasingly expensive Brooklyn neighborhoods have been turning to the suburbs, where they have taken advantage of open space and cheaper housing to establish modern-day versions of the European shtetls where their ancestors lived for centuries before the Holocaust.

&gt; The expansion of Hasidic communities in New York‚Äôs Hudson Valley, the Catskills and northern New Jersey has led to predictable sparring over new housing development and local political control. It has also led to flare-ups of rhetoric seen by some as anti-Semitic.

&gt; Now, a pair of violent attacks on such communities, just weeks apart, worry many that intolerance is boiling over.

&gt; On Dec. 10, a man and woman killed a police officer and then stormed into a kosher grocery in Jersey City, fatally shooting three people inside before dying in an hourslong gunfight with police. The slayings happened in a neighborhood where Hasidic families had recently been relocating, amid pushback from some local officials who complained about representatives of the community going door to door, offering to buy homes at Brooklyn prices.

&gt; And on Saturday, a man rushed into a rabbi‚Äôs home in Monsey, New York, during a Hanukkah celebration, hacking at people with a machete. Five people were wounded, including one who remained hospitalized Tuesday. Federal prosecutors said the man charged in the attack, Grafton Thomas, had handwritten journals containing anti-Semitic comments and a swastika and had researched Hitler‚Äôs hatred of Jews online.

&gt; At a meeting Monday hosted by U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand in Rockland County, where Monsey is, some Jewish leaders blamed inflammatory rhetoric on social media and from local elected officials for the rising threat of anti-Semitic violence.

&gt; Days after the killings in Jersey City, a local school board member there, Joan Terrell-Paige, assailed Jews as ‚Äúbrutes‚Äù on Facebook, saying she believed the killers were trying to send a message with the slaughter. ‚ÄúAre we brave enough to explore the answer to their message?‚Äù she asked.

&gt; A widely condemned political ad last summer created by a local Republican group claimed that an Orthodox Jewish county legislator was ‚Äúplotting a takeover‚Äù that threatens ‚Äúour way of life.‚Äù

&gt; ‚ÄúIn the last few years in Rockland County I have seen a rise in hate rhetoric, and I was able to foresee it would end in violence,‚Äù said Aron Wieder, the legislator targeted in the video ad. ‚ÄúYou have seen on social media where the Orthodox community has been called a cancer, leeches, people who don‚Äôt pay taxes. It has become normal and accepted to say derogatory and hateful things about Jewish people.‚Äù

&gt; Swastikas have been scrawled around the county, and frightened parents are asking law enforcement for more visible security at synagogues and schools, Wieder said.

&gt; Bigoted messages have gone unchecked for years, said Rabbi Yisroel Kahan, administrative director of the Oizrim Jewish Council. He pointed to hateful comments on social media and false online rumors that have spilled over into everyday life.

&gt; ‚ÄúIt has been tolerated for far too long,‚Äù he said.

&gt; Hasidic families began migrating from New York City to suburban communities in the 1970s, hoping to create the sort of cohesive community some recalled from Europe.

&gt; Rockland County, 15 miles (24 kilometers) northwest of Manhattan, now has the largest Jewish population per capita of any U.S. county, with 31%, or 90,000 residents, being Jewish. The ultra-Orthodox population is highly visible in small towns like Monsey, where bearded Hasidic men in black overcoats and fedoras converse in Yiddish along the sidewalks and Orthodox women wear modest black skirts and head scarves as they go about their daily errands.

&gt; In small towns everywhere, resentment against newcomers and ‚Äúoutsiders‚Äù isn‚Äôt uncommon. Proposals for multi-family housing complexes in sleepy communities of single-family homes often trigger fervent opposition complete with lawn signs and rowdy town board meeting crowds.

&gt; Yet the tone of the debates over growth in some areas where Hasidic families have been moving has been more intense. 

&gt; In East Ramapo, there were legal fights after Hasidic voters, who generally do not send their children to public schools, elected a majority of members of the local school board. 

&gt; Some towns have enacted zoning changes forbidding new houses of worship. 

&gt; In the small town of C...

Not true, YPG is Syrian offshoot of the PKK, they directly share equipment and menpower.

Erdogan might have bought oil from ISIS, which is terrible if it's true. No arguments there. But this is not the point. Point is Obama armed insurgent groups in Syria, and then they became the ISIS, and then US government supported YPG to kill the ISIS they've created, which also happens to be terrorizing Turkey.

Why is West supporting YPG?

1- To create a Kurdish sattalite state to guard the oil, and protect Israel

2- To sell more weapons by destabilizing the region

3- Because of anti-Turk lobbies

Choose one or more.

I agree that Ben surviving would have been more interesting, but him healing Rey established without a doubt that he returned to the light side because Force Healing is firmly a light-side ability the dark siders cannot use. As for mirroring the OT's redemption arc, well, that's actually a very common theme in a lot of stories, both inside the EU legend stories and outside of Star Wars as a whole. It's not a rehash but a common story telling device.

There's nothing wrong with going by a formula. It typically guarantees structure and proper plot points. That's not this series' problem. The problem here was the lack of pre-planning for the whole trilogy. I personally would have loved to see some galactic threat like the Yuuzhan Vong or even Abeloth. Both of those would have forced Luke to team up with his enemies (if we're keeping all the same characters, then that would be Kylo). We'd get to see Luke as the amazing Grandmaster he was supposed to be and see him do crazy amazing stuff. And him dying by sacrificing himself at some point would be perfectly fine also. Maybe he did so to protect his small band of trainees or something.

I also would have been fine with TFA as is, with Luke having isolated himself, not out of fear, but because he sensed the great threat through the Force and went to Ach'to to meditate and prepare himself for what's to come. And with Rey showing up he would realize he doesn't need to face the threat alone and comes out of isolation.

I don‚Äôt know enough about all of the countries to think of anything else and like I said, get very overwhelmed and discouraged when doing research.

Regarding Hostels. I‚Äôve never booked one and I guess I have a fear of some kind of ‚Äúno vacancy‚Äù and I end up having to sleep on the street because I can‚Äôt find a place to stay. It happened to me in San Francisco one time and it wasn‚Äôt the funnest experience. I know once I book my first one, the fear will probably go away. But since I‚Äôve never booked one before and am unfamiliar with the typical availability, it gets me a little anxious. Especially if I‚Äôll be in an unfamiliar country with a different language.

So far I‚Äôve just been looking at other people‚Äôs itineraries on the internet just to get a feel for what a travel plan might look like. I‚Äôve learned a lot just by doing that. I took a basic one that hits various cities in Germany, Czechia, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria, Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Amsterdam. I want to fit Warsaw, Poland in there somehow.

I‚Äôve also learned about the euro rail pass. So I assume I‚Äôll end up getting one of those to take care of the long stretches of travel.
 
AND I‚Äôve also learned that it‚Äôs better to spend more time in certain areas to enjoy the travel rather than try to hit everything just for the sake of hitting it. So, for that reason I may cut a few locations out. I have a hard time imagining distances and knowing how much time I should spend in a given location.

Is that the UK has never really considered itself European or really involved with European politics. (Up until really last Century) This really stems from the napoleonic era when all of mainland Europe was on the continental system and Britain was either at war or isolated from them. And now given the ever closer union of the EU. the uk governments has been against any further integration this really hampered any moving forwards because the EU doesn‚Äôt like to two it on a couple of country‚Äôs basis and wants the change to happen throughout the whole block. 

Leading up to the independence referendum the government tried to get CONCESSIONS from the EU to get a remain vote if I‚Äôm being honest this is not a sign of a team player but of a member only in it for the economic benefits. Which I respect but instead of allowing the rest of the EU to carry on (and opting out) they have been blocking and vetoing legislation in the EU. This has frustrated many on the continent. And it‚Äôs true. The BCC did a ‚Äòwhat Europeans think about brexit‚Äô whilst pretty much all where sad about the breakup some where optimistic for the EU to get going again seeing the ‚Äòsoon‚Äô departure of the UK as a way to move forward. 

We don‚Äôt see the Brits as ‚Äòinferior‚Äô quite the opposite. We are tired of the UK‚Äôs objection to everything. 

Its just that politics has caused a divorce and a parting of ways there‚Äôs no other way of really putting it. It‚Äôs a sad breakup. But with good; governments, commissions and good will I think both parties can succeed.

There absolutely is - higher the speed, larger the distance. Speed is way of adjusting distance, but ultimately distance is the key here: mainly you have to keep large enough distance to stop in time in case vehicle in front of you slams on their brakes. Meanwhile, you adjust speed based on other factors. Legal speed limit is only one of them, flow of traffic is important, weather etc.

Bottom line is decreasing speed wouldn't change jack shit if he was driving at proportional distance. You can be going at 1 km/h and still rear end someone if you're driving all the way up his ass. That's why there is such a thing as 'X second rule' when it comes to driving, which is measure of distance changing with speed. How many seconds you need? Well, there are varying recommendations but main part is understanding two factors:

1) Braking efficiency - generally speaking modern road cars have surprisingly similar stopping distances, but there is a bit of a difference. If you're driving older car, with heavy load or - even though you shouldn't drive such car at all - one with terrible tyres and/or brakes, adjust for it.

2) Reaction time - modern research actually suggests old ""1,5s reaction time"" or ""average 2,1 s reaction time"" is actually completely wrong. It varies a lot, and is actually dependent on kinematic cues more than anything.

Hence, usually the answer to 'how many seconds of distance I need to keep' is 2 or 3.

There's even more to that. For once, you're not just looking at the car in front of you. Or rather: you shouldn't. You should watch car in front of that one, and preferably the one in front, and one in front... basically always look as far ahead as you can, don't just focus on nearest object. If you're reacting to the same obstacle the car in front of you is at the same moment he is, you don't have to brake as hard and you will warn people behind you who again will have more time to react (and you can adjust your braking force too and avoid getting rear ended).

&gt;Even if he was under the speed limit, if he hits someone from behind its 100% his fault and there‚Äôs not a legal system in the world that has a different view.

That's not ""100%"". It's a lot of %, but there absolutely are exceptions. For example if a car changes lane in front of you there's no legal expectation for you to react quickly enough, at least in any European country.",True,False,False,,,0,1577976728,,False,0,{},fcuaxnk,False,t3_eiux42,False,True,t1_fcu5ssi,/r/IdiotsInCars/comments/eiux42/well_this_excuse_ought_to_be_good/fcuaxnk/,False,,1586549368,2,True,False,IdiotsInCars,t5_3aimx,r/IdiotsInCars,public,0,[],

The most expensive part is easy. In the UK the government doesn't subsidise rail operations (they do subsidise investment in new tracks etc). Almost every other country in Europe uses tax revenue to subsidise operations.

According to the latest EU figures (published 2019, covers 2016) operational subsidies range from 0% in the UK to 400% in Bulgaria. The Czech Republic provides 160% subsidy (ie for every 100 taken in fares, the government provides another 160, so total revenue is 260. In the UK the fares have to be 2.6 times as high as the Czech Republic to get the same revenue) 

[https://ec.europa.eu/transport/sites/transport/files/6th\_rmms\_report.pdf](https://ec.europa.eu/transport/sites/transport/files/6th_rmms_report.pdf) p40

Eliminating subsidies from operations is a political decision but it's also based on the fact the UK has the most congested railways in Europe. Passenger numbers have more  than doubled since the early 90s and have now reached their highest ever levels. As a result the UK now has 40% of all the congested track in the EU.

The UK still has subsidies for some operators, but they are paid by levies on the busier services: [https://orr.gov.uk/\_\_data/assets/pdf\_file/0013/40351/uk-rail-industry-financial-information-2017-18.pdf](https://orr.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0013/40351/uk-rail-industry-financial-information-2017-18.pdf) p16",True,False,False,,,0,1577977801,,False,0,{},fcuckpy,False,t3_eixvsz,False,False,t1_fcu4gm7,/r/Scotland/comments/eixvsz/rail_fares_to_go_up_across_scotland/fcuckpy/,False,,1586550153,7,True,False,Scotland,t5_2qkli,r/Scotland,public,0,[],

For the homosexual population, the transmission risk would be 3 times higher through 3 times more gay men being infected, 10x more through the gay community being 10x smaller than the general population and 30x more through the transmission rate being 1.7% instead of 0.04%, which would be an overall 900x increase or a transmission rate of approximately 0.027% per MSM encounter.

I also found this, About [15% of gay and bisexual men have HIV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV_and_men_who_have_sex_with_men), while 28% of transgender women test positive in the US.

So, HIV definitely is problematic for the gay community even in the first world.

&gt;**Andrew proposes funding the Freedom Dividend by consolidating some welfare programs and implementing a Value Added Tax of 10 percent.** Current welfare and social program beneficiaries would be given a choice between their current benefits or $1,000 cash unconditionally ‚Äì most would prefer cash with no restriction.  
&gt;  
&gt;A Value Added Tax (VAT) is a tax on the production of goods or services a business produces. It is a fair tax and it makes it much harder for large corporations, who are experts at hiding profits and income, to avoid paying their fair share. A VAT is nothing new. 160 out of 193 countries in the world already have a Value Added Tax or something similar, including all of Europe which has an average VAT of 20 percent.  
&gt;  
&gt;The means to pay for the basic income will come from four sources:  
&gt;  
&gt;1. Current spending: We currently spend between $500 and $600 billion a year on welfare programs, food stamps, disability and the like. This reduces the cost of the Freedom Dividend because **people already receiving benefits would have a choice between keeping their current benefits and the $1,000, and would not receive both.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Additionally, we currently spend over 1 trillion dollars on health care, incarceration, homelessness services and the like. We would save $100 ‚Äì 200+ billion as people would be able to take better care of themselves and avoid the emergency room, jail, and the street and would generally be more functional. The Freedom Dividend would pay for itself by helping people avoid our institutions, which is when our costs shoot up. Some studies have shown that $1 to a poor parent will result in as much as $7 in cost-savings and economic growth.  
&gt;  
&gt;2. A VAT: Our economy is now incredibly vast at $19 trillion, up $4 trillion in the last 10 years alone. **A VAT at half the European level would generate $800 billion in new revenue**. A VAT will become more and more important as technology improves because you cannot collect income tax from robots or software.  
&gt;  
&gt;3. **New revenue**: Putting money into the hands of American consumers would grow the economy. The Roosevelt Institute projected that the economy will grow by approximately $2.5 trillion and create 4.6 million new jobs. **This would generate approximately $800 ‚Äì 900 billion in new revenue from economic growth.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**4. Taxes on top earners and pollution:** By removing the Social Security cap, implementing a financial transactions tax, and ending the favorable tax treatment for capital gains/carried interest, we can decrease financial speculation while also funding the Freedom Dividend. We can add to that a carbon fee that will be partially dedicated to funding the Freedom Dividend, making up the remaining balance required to cover the cost of this program.",True,False,False,,,0,1577979284,,1577980724,0,{},fcuevry,False,t3_eiywtm,False,True,t1_fcudwuy,/r/AskReddit/comments/eiywtm/does_andrew_yangs_universal_basic_income_proposal/fcuevry/,False,,1586551270,2,True,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,r/AskReddit,public,0,[],

So far, the only ""problems"" that I have encountered are the players themselves, and the matchmaking. I don't mean to say that the players are toxic, thought you will certainly encounter some. Perhaps it's just the EU West 2 server, but it feels like you are screaming into the void a lot when you try to use the chat to find groups or talk to people who are standing around in a town.

The matchmaking is comparable to World of Tanks, if you have ever played it. Sometimes you wait 20 seconds, sometimes you wait 8 minutes for a match. I do not necessarily mind this, as long as you are lucky enough to have someone accept/challenge you to a duel in the mean time. Or have chores or something to do while waiting. Still, some will be pulling their hair having to wait a while between some matches.

Gear has been pretty scarce during leveling (if that even changes after) and getting materials to craft them doesn't look any better. There also seems to be only two kinds of crafting. Before level 30, and after level 30. It does not help either that you are given the two first sets for free while leveling (minus the helmet, so there is a tip for you on what to focus on during leveling). This isn't the end of the world, but it is kind of a bummer. Could also be bad luck, I guess.

Because I wanted to see the difference, I also spent some money to buy the Season Pass on one of those characters, and was gifted 3-days of Premium Account that I used on the other. The difference between the Premium account and the regular felt insignificant, in terms of leveling, but the Season Pass gives you a bunch of crafting materials which make upgrading gear easier.

So far, it has been pretty decent and none of the micro transactions feel gross to me.

If you have ever thought to yourself, I would love a game that mixes Mount &amp; Blade (but with better troops) and Dynasty Warrior, this is the game for you. If nothing else it's worth trying, and I have personally had a lot of fun despite fuming at my team mates every once in a while.

EDIT: I remembered one thing, which could be pretty big. Everything you do is character based. Not account based.

Military expenditure in General is also not very reflective of actual capability

**From SIPRI:**
SIPRI uses market exchange rates, or where applicable fixed official exchange rates, to convert local currency military expenditure data into US dollars (whether current or constant prices). Market exchange rates are determined by the supply and demand of currencies used in international transactions. However, the prices of many goods and services on domestic markets are determined in partial or complete isolation from the rest of the world. **Therefore, the MERs do not always accurately reflect differences in price levels between countries.** Fixed, official exchange rates may be even less reflective of the actual purchasing power of a currency within the country that uses it.

**An alternative is to use purchasing power parity (PPP) conversion factors (or PPP exchange rates)**. The PPP dollar rate of a country's currency is defined by the World Bank as 'the number of units of a country's currency required to buy the same amount of goods and services in the domestic market as a U.S. dollar would buy in the United States'.  The only PPP rates available for all countries are GDP- based basket of goods and services that are major components of the gross domestic product. Such GDP-based PPP rates are designed to control for differences in price levels and thus to provide a measure of the real purchasing power of the GDP of each country.

**Using GDP-based PPP rates instead of MERs for currency conversion results in much higher output and expenditure figures for many developing and transition countries since they have relatively low prices for non-traded goods and services**‚Äîthus giving the currency higher purchasing power. A unit of local currency therefore has greater purchasing power within a developing country (which is better reflected by using PPP rates) than it has internationally (which is what is reflected by using MERs). For those such developing and transition countries for whom data was available for 2014, the median increase in military expenditure figures from using PPP rates instead of MERs was by a factor of 2.13. Three-quarters of these countries would see their relative figures increase by at least 79 per cent. However, for most of the 'developed' countries in Western Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan, the use of PPP rates on GDP and military expenditure figures leads to a fall in these totals relative to the USA, by a median amount of 9 per cent. For countries in Central Europe and East Asia that have more recently entered the ranks of rich nations, the picture is somewhere in between. **However, the reliability of such PPP rates is lower than for MERs, since PPP rates are statistical estimates, calculated on the basis of collected price data for a basket of goods and services for benchmark years.** Between benchmark years, the PPP rates are extrapolated forward using ratios of prices indexes, either GDP deflators or consumer price indexes. **Like all statistical estimates they are subject to a margin of error.**

Furthermore, GDP-based PPP rates are of limited relevance for the conversion of military expenditure data into US dollars. **Such PPP rates are designed to reflect the purchasing power for goods and services that are representative of spending patterns in each country, that is, primarily for civilian goods and services. Military expenditure is used to purchase a number of goods and services that are not typical of national consumption patterns.** For example, the price of conscripts can be assumed to be lower than the price of a typical basket of goods and services, while the prices of advanced weapon systems and of their maintenance and repair services can be assumed to be much higher. The extent to which this data reflects the amount of military goods and services that the military budget can buy is not known. Due to these uncertainties, SIPRI uses market exchange rates to convert military expenditure data into US dollars, despite their limitations.",True,False,False,,,0,1577982131,,1577982613,0,{},fcuj2e2,False,t3_eixlmq,False,False,t3_eixlmq,/r/LessCredibleDefence/comments/eixlmq/most_countries_by_military_spending_19142018/fcuj2e2/,False,,1586553265,13,True,False,LessCredibleDefence,t5_2yyyd,r/LessCredibleDefence,public,0,[],

Hitler banned guns from Jews. Know where that lead them? To their deaths. I have cousins buried in shallow graves in Eastern Europe thanks to anti-gun policy.

Are you suicidal? If so you need help. I own several guns- currently 5. Am I 500 times more likely to shoot my head off because I own five guns? No. 

Guns have a higher success rate when
It comes to suicide because it is quick, effective, and painless.

Another great thing about Perth is the sunsets can be really amazing as the sun is setting over the ocean, so be sure to head to the beach towards evening as well, not just during the day.

Osbourne was fired from the band in 1979 due to alcohol and drug problems, but went on to have a successful solo career, releasing eleven studio albums, the first seven of which were all awarded multi-platinum certifications in the United States. Osbourne has since reunited with Black Sabbath on several occasions. He rejoined the band in 1997 and helped record the group's final studio album 13 (2013) before they embarked on a farewell tour which culminated in a final performance in their home city, Birmingham, England, in February 2017. His longevity and success have earned him the informal title of 'Godfather of Heavy Metal'.""

""Osbourne's total album sales from his years in Black Sabbath, combined with his solo work, is over 100 million.

The founding fathers were some revolutionary badasses in the 1700s. Just look at what they did and went through. The natives here were some badasses as well, they embodied a No Quarter Given policy for everyone except young children and some teen girls. The Comanchee were badasses. The Sioux Nation and what they did to Custer were the personification of badasses. The Texans were badasses standing up to Santa Anna after his No Quarter Policy. We exploded onto the world stage fighting and never stopped. Many altercations were good and many were bad.

Before WW2 we werent big on standing armies. During the war everyone played their part for the war effort. The old and rich bought war bonds to keep everything funded. Entire factories switched industury to assist the war effort. Women worked, etc.


We were demobilization after WW2 but Stalin did not hold up his end of the deal after Yalta and was sending the Red Army back west across Europe. We were in the process of stripping everything back down to bare bones but because of this we had to remobilize because no other power in Europe could stop the Soviet Army. Everyone was decimated after two world wars. The Soviets were running on Iron Will (tm)

Since the Cold War was really Western Capitilistic ideals vs Communism of the Soviet Republics no one in the major fighting power wanted to be characterized as communistic. Those individuals that fought in the war and were rallied to help via bonds, and worked in the factory were encouraged by the government to be prideful during the war period. Since the Cold War was surreptitious and about spying you had to have the home team jersey, facepaint, and autographed memorabilia everywhere you went. Some of it was actual fear of Soviet Influence, I think you were encouraged to turn in your neighbor if you suspected them of being a Russian spy. 

Our great grandparents and some parents fought in the war. Their progeny went on to lead the country. Its all a sphere of influence all the way down. 

**With that being said, I absolutely love my country which is patriotism. Patriotism is also being able to despise the leaders of that country. Nationalism is following those bad leaders to the ends of the Earth which America as a whole will not nor ever.

Back in the days of the Webley Service Rifle and the BSA Light Pattern and things like that, it was necessary to get some weight to behind the pellet to make it carry enough power to its intended target, and that's when the whole .22 for fur thing got started. It's just not true any more, and hasn't been since before world war 2.

Europe's largest pest control company (which, incidentally, once commissioned its own model of PCP rifle), issues .177, not .22, to people with licenses to have much bigger guns. Big multinationals don't let licensing issues stand in their way, if an employee need a firearms license or a poisons license or an explosives license they'll ensure the employee gets one or replace them with someone who can, that's how it works. Most of Europe we're just one bit of petty bureaucratic paperwork away from being able to have anything without fpe or fps limits, it's no harder than getting a license to drive a car, and some stuff is actually easier to get here than in so-called free countries where you have to apply for a special hard-to-get federal license just to fit a moderator.

My own experience shows the same, there's no discernible difference between any calibre below .25 as long as you're reasonable power and reasonably close up, it's all about shot placement and nothing else. Shot placement, which comes from accuracy. Better off concentrating on getting more accuracy from the gun and from the shooter than pursuing the totally false concept of ""must have .22""

The real differences:-

 in a PCP or co2 gun a bigger calibre might give a shot or two more per fill for the same energy output, so .22 is more efficient than .177 but it's only really applicable when you've got a finite supply of air or gas to use up, totally irrelevant for a spring, a ram, or a multipump.

.22 pellets are easier to handle with cold fingers.

As long as pricing in Europe and in the US are independent from each other and these goods are effectively in different markets, you could treat this as entirely different things.

 De quem s√£o eles? N√£o se sabe.

 Por que est√£o l√°? Indefinido.

 ""√â assustador"", disse Missy Blackman, que viu tr√™s drones voando sobre sua fazenda nos arredores de Palisade, em Nebraska, em uma noite recente, incluindo um que pairou bem acima de sua casa. ""Eu tenho muitas perguntas sobre o porqu√™ e o que s√£o, e ningu√©m parece ter respostas.""

 Desde antes do Natal, os departamentos de pol√≠cia da regi√£o foram bombardeados por relatos de grandes drones com luzes piscantes e envergadura de at√© 1,80 metro, voando sobre cidades rurais e campos.

  [Os ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/12/de-operacao-comercial-a-monitoramento-de-fronteira-mercado-de-drones-vira-um-grande-negocio.shtml)[drones](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/12/de-operacao-comercial-a-monitoramento-de-fronteira-mercado-de-drones-vira-um-grande-negocio.shtml) irritaram os moradores, provocaram uma investiga√ß√£o federal e sa√≠ram no notici√°rio internacional, embora possam ser perfeitamente legais. Ainda assim, eles permanecem sem explica√ß√£o.

 ""Em termos de aeronaves que voam √† noite e n√£o s√£o identificadas, √© a primeira vez para mim, pessoalmente"", disse o delegado James Brueggeman, do condado de Perkins, em Nebraska, que trabalha na pol√≠cia h√° cerca de 28 anos e viu os drones durante uma patrulha na ter√ßa-feira (28) √† noite.

 Ele disse que ouviu rumores sobre pessoas que queriam derrubar um drone e pediu aos moradores que denunciem os drones √† pol√≠cia. ""Acho que √© alguma brincadeira, mas √© preciso lembrar em que parte do pa√≠s n√≥s vivemos"", afirmou o delegado. ""As pessoas aqui n√£o querem que sua privacidade seja invadida.""

 Os voos chamaram a aten√ß√£o exatamente quando a Administra√ß√£o Federal de Avia√ß√£o (FAA na sigla em ingl√™s) prop√¥s, na semana passada, novos regulamentos que exigiriam a identifica√ß√£o da maioria dos drones. Ian Gregor, porta-voz do √≥rg√£o, disse que o momento da proposta foi uma coincid√™ncia, mas que a FAA abriu uma investiga√ß√£o sobre os drones vistos no Colorado e em Nebraska.

 ""V√°rias divis√µes da FAA e ag√™ncias governamentais est√£o investigando esses relat√≥rios"", disse Gregor em um email. Ele se recusou a discutir o inqu√©rito em detalhe, mas afirmou que os investigadores est√£o tentando determinar quem opera os drones e o objetivo dos voos.

 No Facebook, nas linhas telef√¥nicas de emerg√™ncia e colunas de jornais locais, os drones foram o assunto nas √°reas rurais do Colorado e Nebraska. E √† medida que mais pessoas veem os drones ‚Äîhabitantes de quatro munic√≠pios disseram que os viram na ter√ßa-feira‚Äî, o mesmo acontece com a urg√™ncia das perguntas dos moradores.

 Alguns sugeriram que eles podem fazer parte de uma simples opera√ß√£o de mapeamento ou de uma pesquisa de terreno realizada por uma empresa de petr√≥leo e g√°s ‚Äîmas por que esses voos ocorrem √† noite?

 O senador Cory Gardner, do Colorado, disse em uma rede social que ""monitoraria de perto a situa√ß√£o"". Uma manchete de jornal em Akron, no Colorado, perguntou: ""O que h√° com os drones?"". V√°rias ag√™ncias policiais alertaram os moradores que derrubar um drone em voo seria um crime.

 ""Eles est√£o alto o suficiente para voc√™ n√£o conseguir atirar em um, de qualquer maneira, mas baixo o suficiente para serem um inc√¥modo"", disse Dawn George, que mora perto de Wray, no Colorado. Segundo ela, seu cachorro late para os drones quando eles voam sobre sua propriedade.

 George disse que ouviu especula√ß√µes sobre quem seria o respons√°vel pelos voos ‚Äîo governo? Um cartel? Uma empresa de g√°s?‚Äî e teme que nunca saber√£o a verdade.

 ""De repente, tudo vai parar e n√£o teremos respostas"", disse George. ""E isso √© muito perturbador para muitas pessoas. √â o medo do desconhecido.""

 Os drones n√£o tripulados, que ca√≠ram no gosto popular nos √∫ltimos anos e podem ser usados para v√°rias coisas, de mapeamento a fotografia e agricultura, podem ser dif√≠ceis de rastrear.

 Todos os operadores de drones, exceto dos menores, precisam se registrar junto ao governo federal desde 2015, mas n√£o existe uma maneira direta e legal de as autoridades estaduais e locais identificarem o propriet√°rio de um drone espec√≠fico ou acompanharem a localiza√ß√£o do aparelho.

 ""A maioria das pessoas est√° muito tranquila e diz que deve ser algu√©m mapeando ou fazendo topografia"", afirmou Michael Yowell, capit√£o de pol√≠cia no condado de Lincoln, no Colorado, cuja casa foi sobrevoada por um esquadr√£o de drones na v√©spera de Ano-Novo. ""Mas voc√™ n√£o pode descartar o que n√£o sabe.""

 Os avistamentos de drones come√ßaram no nordeste do Colorado em meados de dezembro e s√≥ cresceram desde ent√£o. Quase todos os avistamentos ocorreram entre o entardecer e as 22h, embora Blackman tenha dito que os viu mais tarde em Nebraska e, pela primeira vez na quarta-feira (1), durante o dia. Ela disse que os olhou com bin√≥culos e n√£o viu nenhuma marca, apenas suas cores, prata e branco.

 O xerife Todd Combs, do condado de Yuma, no Colorado, disse na ter√ßa-feira em um post no Facebook que os drones pareciam estar a pelo menos 50 metros de pr√©dios ou pessoas, segundo as imagens que ele viu.

 ""Existem muitas teorias sobre o que est√° acontecendo, mas neste momento √© s√≥ o que elas s√£o"", disse ele.

It is clear from beginning that Iran (and Shia paramilitary/militia supported/affiliated by/to Iran), is rare ""safe"" target in ME for the US, and convenient excuse for the US to remain military presence in and over whole ME. 

Why ""safe"", thus ""convenient""? Because, there is informal coalition against Iran from various reason and interests - from pure Oil/Gas trade competition, over Palestine/Jerusalem/Israel issue, to century old religious Shia vs Sunni dispute. And on top of that, the US ""personal"" grunge for loosing valuable asset (i.e. Shah Reza Pahlavi) in Islamic revolution. 

That said, ""safe"" unless the total war-gates broke loose. In that case Gulf Monarchies on the fire-front are hoping that the US will protect them. And until today, it was possible and viable solution, but in modern missile/drone World, they are no more immune from Iran retaliation.

As for the Israel - troubled Syria and Iraq serve as their buffer zone, but are not guarantee for long term safety. So, the Israel interests is that all those Iran affiliated groups, remains low-tech, and with known low-stamina Arab temperament - they can manage all direct threats, or at least for some ~~prolonged~~ time. 

So they believe... But, what if the ""war"" did become prolonged - without consideration for the loses in life, and thus effectively torch Palestine and Lebanon, and paralyze Israel?   
  
The recent Israelis actions did not manage to remove this card from the table, on the contrary - from the defender they did become widely recognized even and on the West, as ""aggressors"". The famous ""antisemitic"" accusation for anyone daring to question Israel behavior, simple do not work anymore.

So, again, what a heck is the true US interests in ME?

Positive Christianity (German: Positives Christentum) was a movement within Nazi Germany which mixed the belief that the racial purity of the German people should be maintained with Nazi ideology and elements of Christianity. Adolf Hitler used the term in article 24 of the 1920 Nazi Party Platform, stating: ""the Party represents the standpoint of Positive Christianity"". Nondenominational, the term could be variously interpreted. Positive Christianity allayed fears among Germany's Christian majority as expressed through their hostility towards the established churches of large sections of the Nazi movement.

**Martin Luther and antisemitism**

Martin Luther (1483‚Äì1546) was a German professor of theology, priest and seminal leader of the Reformation. His positions on Judaism continue to be controversial. These changed dramatically from his early career, where he showed concern for the plight of European Jews to his later years, when embittered by his failure to convert them to  Christianity, he became outspokenly antisemitic in his statements and writings. Recent historical studies have focused on Luther's influence on modern antisemitism, with a particular focus on Adolf Hitler and the Nazis.

The Varangian Guard was known for being primarily composed of recruits from northern Europe, including Norsemen from Scandinavia and Anglo-Saxons from England. The recruitment of distant foreigners from outside Byzantium to serve as the emperor's personal guard was pursued as a deliberate policy, as they lacked local political loyalties and could be counted upon to suppress revolts by disloyal Byzantine factions.The Rus' provided the earliest members of the Varangian Guard. They were in Byzantine service from as early as 874.

Please allow me a tangent. I wanted discuss why I think the term ‚Äúfirst mover advantage‚Äù is overused both in technology and in business in general.

The iPhone is not the most successful product of all time because Apple was the first company to put together a touchscreen mobile device not solely based on design. Design, marketing, supply chain management, pricing (which is actually part of marketing and supply chain management) and features all played a part. However those were all just table stakes.

Lock, in this case a bunch of different technologies coming together at the right time played a huge part. Mobile processors being fast enough, mobile networks finally being fast enough and shifts in the business world that allowed bring your own device to be viable all lined up in 2007. Could they have launched in 2006? Possibly? Could they have launched in 2008, probably not. They launched the right product at the right time but we‚Äôre far from the first mover. But once they started capturing the high-end of the market, and advantages that made it impossible for them to be displaced, at least up until now and possibly into the future.

The same could be said for Facebook. Many things can be said for how Facebook marketing the product making an exclusive through college at first and how they expanded and that the design understood that while some people wanted the flexibility to customize things like myspace allowed, most people just want an a product that worked. However, the timing was right for a general purpose social media platform to rise and once they captured most of the market, everything else followed including their ability to simply purchase any viable competitors that came along.

So you‚Äôre absolutely right that the Islamic golden age was a period where the Islamic world far surpassed the technology and commerce and innovation coming out of India, China, Europe and everywhere else. But nothing they did was able to give them an overwhelming advantage at the time. The European powers rose when things like the printing press and innovations in agriculture and the sciences including navigation put them in a position to press their advantages until the became overwhelming.

So luck is the correct answer. The rise of China coincides with the ability to scale production and supply chains to truly take advantage of their huge population.",True,False,False,,,0,1577989534,,False,0,{},fcuvrat,False,t3_ej1i76,False,True,t1_fcusmmd,/r/AskALiberal/comments/ej1i76/im_trying_to_understand_the_liberal_narrative_on/fcuvrat/,False,,1586559299,6,True,False,AskALiberal,t5_2ukxe,r/AskALiberal,public,0,[],

When you actually talk about a single place then you have to take the pros with the cons and at best, the best places you can choose are vaguely in the same category as the US. But even if the answer were that Canada is awesome, for example, that wouldn't mean you shouldn't feel luckily about living in the US, it just means you should feel lucky living in either because even living in the top 2 or 5 or 10 places in the world is still pretty lucky considering what's out there.

However, your examples also don't seem obvious to me. I've heard plenty of examples of expensive housing in Canada or Europe, meanwhile the cost of housing in the US varies enormously and there are many cheap places. [At a glance](https://www.numbeo.com/property-investment/rankings_by_country.jsp?title=2019), the US seems very competitive in that on the whole. According to that chart it's in 2nd place based on the ""affordability index"". Meanwhile, the cost of ""basic goods"" doesn't seem specific or supported enough to be accurate. For example, I consider gasoline for my car to be a basic good and [the US does great at that](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/gas-prices/#20193:United-States:USD:g). But also you have to look at costs in context. For example, California is often the example of what a more liberal policy in the US would look like and given how huge its economy is (e.g. silicon valley, hollywood) it's pretty capable of playing big government. But when you adjust for cost of living, California (which is more of a liberal and heavy-government place) [actually has the highest poverty rate in the US](https://nationaleconomicseditorial.com/2018/01/17/california-poverty-rate/). So, when you look at things holistically (i.e. what is the economic cost for the policies that in isolation sound nice), it's not really clear which is better. Sometimes taking losses on individual policies and issues in order to create a more vibrant economy with a better cost of living may actually be preferable.

For me, I think two big advantages to the US are (1) it's extremely varied due to how much it defers to the many states so you can live in very different cultures and economies while staying in the US and (2) the bill of rights gives us a philosophy on freedom that a lot of other developed countries do not have. For example, Canada's law that seemed to regulate gender pronouns, the UK's ""porn filter"", Australia's encryption backdoor law, etc. are all reminders to me of subtle but powerful difference in the cultural and legal attitude in the US toward freedom of expression.",True,False,False,,,0,1577989762,,1577990538,0,{},fcuw66h,False,t3_eivomg,False,False,t1_fcudbgd,/r/AskAnAmerican/comments/eivomg/do_you_feel_lucky_to_be_born_in_the_united_states/fcuw66h/,False,,1586559487,27,True,False,AskAnAmerican,t5_2uah7,r/AskAnAmerican,public,0,[],

Yeah, I also eat and exercise.

Are you imagining that I don't eat and exercise and that I'm just commenting about eating and exercising that my neighbors do? WTF??? I eat and exercise, and so it's not just commenting on my neighbors. My observation that most doctors share the kinds of exercise and diet lifestyles that women with metabolic disorders tend to ridicule as excessive and extreme, arises from the fact that I live with surrounded by doctors with careers in public health. Don't confuse my making that observation with that being my claim to knowing anything. I have my own references and knowledge and experience with eating and exercising, thank you.

There's a difference between seeing what your community does, and taking that as validation, and having experience what you yourself also do. 

&gt; I live next to a pilot, when do I get to fly a plane?

If you lived next to airline pilots AND you yourself owned a plane, had a private license, and flew, you probably would be ""competent"" to make stray comments on reddit about what, in general, you understand are good practices are for flight plans and prepping for trips. The fact that you are so fearful of women having opinions about food and exercise, when they eat and exercise, is your personal gatekeeping that you should not project onto others. 

Why is it that women can't talk about exercise and diet in pregnancy when virtually every guy who weight lifts, or runs marathons, or is doing any kind of fitness, can talk about their opinions about workouts and recovery/bulking diets without getting mugged and shrilled at for being ignorant asses who can't have competent ideas?

The whole culture of women loudly belittling other women as incompetent so that women, and women alone, can't have competent opinions about their health, diet and exercise lifestyles, when literally anyone with a penis can and does comment about their ideas in those subjects all the time, is self-hating, internalized misogyny.

And if you weren't so reflexively fearful of the idea that fitness and healthy diets are core life concerns of women, and if you weren't so fearful of medical authority, you'd maybe glance back to my comments and realize that I posted sources for many of my claims and those included medical studies. So your attempt to portray everything I said as being backed up by zero experience or information of my own, and/or zero authority, is literally false and misleading. If you had any competent way of processing health information, you'd respond to any claims I made that you disagree with, instead of engaging in shrill personal attacks online. 

The only reason this information sounds like condescension to you is because you don't think about health information you hear, because you do what you're told by authority figures. You don't allow yourself to think and you have not developed any critical thinking process for health information. So if another woman posts comments about health practices online, you take that as orders, when it's just informed opinion like any informed opinion, for example ""It's good to have a basic black pencil skirt to fall back on for business wardrobe"". Because you don't give yourself permission to think about certain subjects, it's like heresy and other women issuing orders to you, when you see comments about those subjects online. But not every woman is as fearful of thinking about health information and diet and exercise, as you are. 

I'm not condescending. It's women like you who have internalized fear of thinking and obedience to intellectual authority, who take random comments about health, diet and exercise information as threatening and breaking rules of status and authority. I dare you to go on /r/fitness and shrill like this, insulting random male commenters there and calling them incompetent, for sharing diet and workout opinions.

Your internalized inferiority and misogyny is not MY condescension.

And you don't have to be a doctor to have ideas about how to eat and exercise. In fact, doctors don't train in that unless they actually take wellness and/or gastroenteritis courses. And ""Clinical nutrition"" is a separate field of study and credentialing than an M.D. gets. 

&gt; Stop giving faulty medical advice, it's dangerous.

It's not ""medical advice"" to talk about eating well and exercising. And the fact that you think so, and that women, and women alone, can't have anything competent to say about eating properly and exercise, when men do it all the time for practically any activity they engage in, makes you someone who conforms to a culture that women are inferior and stupid and have to be told how to live by Smart Others.

Do that, be submissive and believe in your intellectual incompetence and inferiority in matters of how you're allowed to think and talk about how to eat and be fit. But don't come online and shrill at other women who don't share that self-hating lack of agency.

And this culture of self-hating aggression against fitness and health ideas of women is strangely unique to America, as even in Old Europe, women have strong self-care cultural traditions. It's really become a thing in the new millennium for female fitness and health to be attacked publicly as fat acceptance has risen. In fact, America is the only developed country in the world with worsening maternal and childbirth infant mortality rates.

It's women like you who are dangerous. Not only to yourselves, but to others you take it upon yourself to gatekeep and silence. Now, I don't believe that fat acceptance people should be attacked or judged for how they look or their physical condition. But FFS, that culture doesn't give you permission to silence women who are not of that group so that even talking about diet and exercise and healthy physical condition is somehow evil or dangerous. 

Get a grip on your massive ego/narcissim surrounding your beliefs about physical health, will you? Not everyone lives in your particular snow-globe.

[],,ttx1359,1461943937.0,,,[],,Liberal,dark,text,t2_xk531,False,False,[],"&gt;Race isn‚Äôt real.

I think the liberal position is ""race is more of a social construct than a biological reality"", but yeah close enough.

&gt;It‚Äôs just a term invented by light-skinned euros, who thought:  
&gt;  
&gt;1. They were entitled to take over the rest of the world  
&gt;  
&gt;2. The rest of the world‚Äôs people (‚Äúslave races‚Äù) were inferior because:  
&gt;  
&gt;\--A. They were less developed  
&gt;  
&gt;\--B. They had darker skin/different body features

There have been many racist societies in human history other than Europeans, but the current racial dynamic in the US is rooted in this type of thing. There were also cultural and religious reasons for ""othering"" different groups of people and viewing them as inferior.

&gt;Why did they have technologies that enabled them to take over so many lands?  
&gt;  
&gt;1. They just got lucky and got certain ones first, and nobody could stand up to it, like a cheat code.  
&gt;  
&gt;2. They stole it from peoples that used to exist but were basically erased by whites  
&gt;  
&gt;The skin color thing was a fluke that happened to line up with their feeling that they were superior, and they ran with it.

I think here's where you start to go off the rails a bit. You seem to have this idea that there was a kind of pan-European notion of ""whiteness"". My understanding is that that is ahistorical. Europeans did not just pick on non-white people because of racism; they also spent a lot of time picking on and feeling superior to each other, i.e., on other people we would now call ""white"". The last thousand years of European history is a record of pitiless slaughter of whites and non-whites alike.

In terms of getting technologies, there's a whole historical/anthropological literature about it that I'm not too familiar with. The most popular book about it is called ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" by Jared Diamond. Also note that (a) for most of human history, the most technologically advanced civilizations were in Asia and the Middle East, not Europe; (b) technological progress was uneven across Europe itself; and (c) Europeans did indeed get a lot of their technology (like modern math) from other people. So I guess I would say the answer is a combination of #1 and #2.

&gt;Now even though race isn‚Äôt inherently real in the world, we still live in a world colonized by euros (western civ and it‚Äôs failed colonies). Euros separated their societies by ‚Äúrace,‚Äù so your skin either fell above or below their threshold of master or slave race level.  
&gt;  
&gt;A person of color is someone who would have fell on the slave side of that threshold. 

Um, yeah, kinda.

&gt;Which means that since the time that whites declared themselves no longer racist (a few decades ago), a poc found themselves legally equal in the west, but with nowhere close to the equality that white families have. So we get unfair starting lines.

I think the idea that ""poc found themselves legally equal in the west"" is debatable, especially depending on when you believe ""whites declared themselves no longer racist"". Overt racism started to become politically incorrect in the 1940s and 1950s throughout much of the United States, but explicitly racist laws and regulations in housing and employment remained on the books for decades after that. Implicitly racist laws (i.e., laws that were, according to the people who crafted them, deliberately designed to segregate and exclude black people while appearing ""color-blind"") were also created and many remain on the books today.

&gt;Your point about ""starting lines"" is also true, however.  
&gt;  
&gt;So even though we know there is only one race, the human race, we will keep using the racial terms created by the european until such time when we can see true equality has occurred in the world.  
&gt;  
&gt;How will we know it? Well that‚Äôs impossible to say because things are so unequal now. The only thing we can do is keep pushing for equality wherever we see injustice.

There are various metrics that we can use to measure inequality and policies that could help address it, so I don't think it's quite as nebulous as you say. 

&gt;We can take a huge amount from whites before that ever happens. If they feel hurt in that process, it‚Äôs simply the sting of their own egos not liking the ideas that they aren‚Äôt the master race anymore.

Again, it's debatable to what extent this is a ""zero-sum game"". But yes, I am hoping that white privilege will be abolished, and this will lead to real and imagined losses for many whites.",True,False,False,,,0,1577992638,,False,0,{},fcv1dzk,False,t3_ej1i76,False,True,t3_ej1i76,/r/AskALiberal/comments/ej1i76/im_trying_to_understand_the_liberal_narrative_on/fcv1dzk/,False,,1586561954,0,True,False,AskALiberal,t5_2ukxe,r/AskALiberal,public,0,[],

The primary source of European copper was the Falun mine in Sweden, producing up to 3,000 tonnes of copper a year in the Early Modern era.  While it was primarily mined by what were essentially artisan miners, over time the Swedish government began to assert control over such a strategic and valuable natural resource, which also improved the rate of extraction.  By 1620, Gustavus Adolphus had attempted to restrict exports in an attempt to cause an artificial price bubble, allowing Sweden to retain copper for internal purposes like cannon (a contributing factor to Sweden's dominance in artillery in this time) as well as retaining the high revenues that copper brought to Sweden.  This attempt failed, due to the Dutch East Indies Company (VOC).  

The VOC had, as part of its trading relationship, established an outpost in Dejima, now Nagasaki, Japan.  The VOC had very little to actually purchase from Japan as the Japanese did not have much in the way of spices and chinaware that were in demand (certainly not as much compared to the Spice Islands and Ming/Qing) and the bountiful silver was controlled by the government for currency minting as well as export to China.  However, the Japanese did have a surprising amount of copper.  Cheap Japanese labor costs resulted in a price of copper that was very low, especially given the anti-foreign sakoku practices of the Tokugawa shogunate, and as a result the Dutch were able to take this cheap copper and ship it to Batavia (now Jakarta, Indonesia) where it could be either shipped back to Europe or more likely sent to Malacca for trade with Indian merchants.  

[Here is a table showing 1700s copper sales to India from Glamann, ""The Dutch East India company's trade in Japanese copper, 1645‚Äì1736""](https://i.imgur.com/UdsiM6R.png).  As you can see, roughly 12 million (Dutch) pounds of copper (which are roughly equivalent to half a kilogram each) were sent between 1700-1710 to India from Japanese origins, which by my shitty calculations roughly equals about 6,000 tons over the decade.

Not to be an asshole, but you need to determine what is good for you and your SO --  and not the internet forum decide for you. Determining which school to attend based on third-party disclosure is fallible. Try this exercise:

2. Can you achieve that exit at HEC / Judge? \[Yes...\]
3. What region do you want to live / work in?  \[Don't generalize this, but really boil it down\]

Salaries will be comparable across your exit industries within the UK and EU. Parsing out salary reports has less to do with schools and more to do with industry norms in current economic climates.

Yes. Can you work in the UK/France after attending either school (immigration status aside)? Yes. Marketing and entrepreneurial exits are broad and vague so to simplify, both schools are peers in every regard, with an edge going to HEC in quality and Judge riding the coattails of its parent institution but a very good school nonetheless.

Swedish Pediatric Society (they outright call for a ban)

Royal Dutch Medical Association calls it a violation of human rights, and calls for a ""strong policy of deterrence."" this policy has been endorsed by several other organizations:

The Netherlands Society of General Practitioners,

The Netherlands Society of Youth Healthcare Physicians,

The Netherlands Association of Paediatric Surgeons,

The Netherlands Association of Plastic Surgeons,

The Netherlands Association for Paediatric Medicine,

The Netherlands Urology Association, and

The Netherlands Surgeons‚Äô Association.

This procedure should be delayed to a later date when the child can make his own informed decision. Parental preference alone does not justify a non‚Äêtherapeutic procedure.... Advise parents that the current medical consensus is that routine infant male circumcision is not a recommended procedure; it is non‚Äêtherapeutic and has no medical prophylactic basis; current evidence indicates that previously‚Äêthought prophylactic public health benefits do not out‚Äêweigh the potential risks..... Routine infant male circumcision does cause pain and permanent loss of healthy tissue. |

Australian Federation of Aids organizations They state that circumcision has ""no role"" in the HIV epidemic. The German Association of Pediatricians called for a ban recently.

The German Association of Child and Youth Doctors recently Attacked the AAP's claims, saying the benefits they claim, including HIV reduction, are ""questionable,"" and that ""Seen from the outside, cultural bias reflecting the normality of non-therapeutic male circumcision in the US seems obvious, and the report‚Äôs conclusions are different from those reached by doctors in other parts of the Western world, including Europe, Canada, and Australia."" (scroll to page 7 for the English translation.)

The AAP was recently attacked by the President of the British Association of Paediatric Urologists because the evidence of benefit is weak, and they are promoting ""Irreversible mutilating surgery.""

The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Saskatchewan has taken a position against it, saying it is harmful and will likely be considered illegal in the future, given the number of men who are angry that it was done to them and are becoming activists against it.

The President of the Saskatchewan Medical Association has said the same).

The Central Union for Child Welfare ‚Äúconsiders that circumcision of boys that violates the personal integrity of the boys is not acceptable unless it is done for medical reasons to treat an illness. The basis for the measures of a society must be an unconditional respect for the bodily integrity of an under-aged person‚Ä¶ Circumcision can only be allowed to independent major persons, both women and men, after it has been ascertained that the person in question wants it of his or her own free will and he or she has not been subjected to pressure.‚Äù

Royal College of Surgeons of England

""The one absolute indication for circumcision is scarring of the opening of the foreskin making it non- retractable (pathological phimosis). This is unusual before five years of age.""...""The parents and, when competent, the child, must be made fully aware of the implications of this operation as it is a non-reversible procedure."" |

British Medical Association

it is now widely accepted, including by the BMA, that this surgical procedure has medical and psychological risks. .... very similar arguments are also used to try and justify very harmful cultural procedures, such as female genital mutilation or ritual scarification. Furthermore, the harm of denying a person the opportunity to choose not to be circumcised must also be taken into account, together with the damage that can be done to the individual‚Äôs relationship with his parents and the medical profession if he feels harmed by the procedure. .... parental preference alone is not sufficient justification for performing a surgical procedure on a child. .... The BMA considers that the evidence concerning health benefit from non-therapeutic circumcision is insufficient for this alone to be a justification for doing it. |

Australian Medical Association Has a policy of discouraging it, ad says ""The Australian College of Paediatrics should continue to discourage the practice of circumcision in newborns.""

Australian College of Paediatrics:

""The possibility that routine circumcision may contravene human rights has been raised because circumcision is performed on a minor and is without proven medical benefit. Whether these legal concerns are valid will probably only be known if the matter is determined in a court of law .....Neonatal male circumcision has no medical indication. It is a traumatic procedure performed without anaesthesia to remove a normal and healthy prepuce.""|

74% of Australian doctors overall believe circumcision should not be offered, and 51% consider it abuse. Circumcision used to be common in Australia, but the movement against it spread faster there than America, where rates continue to drop.

A letter by the South African Medical Association said this:

The Committee stated that it was unethical and illegal to perform circumcision on infant boys in this instance. In particular, the Committee expressed serious concern that not enough scientifically-based evidence was available to confirm that circumcisions prevented HIV contraction and that the public at large was influenced by incorrect and misrepresented information. The Committee reiterated its view that it did not support circumcision to prevent HIV transmission.|

The Norwegian Council of Medical Ethics states that ritual circumcision of boys is not consistent with important principles of medical ethics, that it is without medical value, and should not be paid for with public funds.

The Norwegian Children‚Äôs Ombudsman is opposed as well.

The Denmark National Council for Children is also opposed.

And recently, the politically appointed Health minister of Norway opposed a ban on circumcision, yet the ban was supported by the Norwegian Medical Association, the Norwegian Nurses Organization, the Norwegian Ombudsman for Children, and the University of Oslo.

The Danish Society of Medical Practitioners Recently said the practice is ‚Äúan assault and should be banned.‚Äù

The Danish Medical Association is ‚Äúfundamentally opposed to male circumcision unless there is a medical reason such as phimosis for carrying out the operation. ‚ÄòIt's very intrusive that adults may decide that newborn to undergo a surgical procedure that is not medically justified and if power is lifelong.

Here in Europe it's relatively common for people to be 'loaned' a car by their employer as part of their remuneration (in effect they lease it on your behalf). The tax office treat this as additional income and as such you must pay additional income tax each year that you have the car.

The amount of tax you must pay each year depends on the list price of the car multiplied by the BIK rate (which depends on the cars CO2 emissions) multiplied by your income tax rate.

""Here‚Äôs how to calculate your company car tax in three simple steps:

1. Take your company car‚Äôs P11D value (for example ¬£15,000)

2. Multiply this value by the car‚Äôs company car tax rate which is dependent on CO2 emissions (for example 23%) to get your BIK amount (¬£3,450)

3. Multiply this BIK value by your personal tax rate - 20%, 40% or 50% - (for example 20%). This will be the amount of company car tax payable.

4. So: ¬£15,000 x 23% = ¬£3,450 (BIK amount) x 20% = ¬£690 per year""

Arguing abortions are life saving is an exception fallacy: if the norm is unjustified but the exception is, then ban the norm and write an exception.

Further, there is a myth that abortion bans increase maternal deaths. This is based on two sources of data: one is the high rate of maternal death before roe v. wade. However, the rate of maternal deaths had been in a steady decline since the 50s due to modernized medicine. The other source for this data is the rate of maternal deaths in third world countries which have abortion bans and low sanitation, as well as poor medical facilities. Again, the high rate of maternal deaths is clearly linked to lack of sanitation and modern medicine. 

There is no reason to use rural Africa and the 1920s to predict the outcomes of abortion bans, when we have perfectly good modern sources of data: Ireland had the strongest abortion bans in Europe for decades, and on of the best rates of maternal health. The U.S. rate of maternal mortality was almost 6 times greater than theirs. In fact, all of the top five countries for maternal health all have significantly stricter abortion bans than the US, like the number one: Finland.

The problem: Sadovnyk doesn‚Äôt have two hands. His right hand, his wife told Reuters, was blown off by a grenade in a training accident six years ago.

&gt;The probes into the killings have been hindered by missing evidence. Many guns allegedly used to shoot protesters have vanished; many of the bullets fired were taken home as souvenirs. Barricades, bullet-pierced trees and other items of forensic evidence were removed, lawyers say.

[],,Mckavity,1474565740.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_11ld5b,False,False,[],"American here, lived in Chile for a long time. It‚Äôs pretty good, but there are a few pitfalls:

1. The banking system is archaic. You will NEVER get paid when you‚Äôre supposed to. It will often take weeks for checks to get processed and bank hours are ridiculous. It‚Äôs pretty much expected in Chile that when someone owes you money it will take weeks to actually get to your pocket. Always remember this and plan accordingly. It is a very difficult place to do business in. 

2. Santiago is a very expensive city, comparable to most American cities. Rents are high, food is pricy, nightlife is hip and trendy with a price tag to match, and most of the regular living expenses are pretty much similar to the US. Also, do not look for an apartment in English or the prices will be unreal. Always search for housing in Spanish using .cl websites, never anything like Craigslist or you will greatly overpay. 

3. The people are great, but very pessimistic. You will find Chile a beautiful country with a great economy, public transportation system, and a nice place to live a quiet, safe life. The locals however, are convinced that they are stuck in the deepest pit of despairing the entire planet. They will tell you that Chile is a post-apocalyptic crime-ridden dystopia of pain and suffering unmatched in the civilized world. It gets really really annoying, like a beautiful woman who thinks she‚Äôs ugly and won‚Äôt stop crying about it. They really just don‚Äôt seem to understand that they‚Äôve got it really good and it can get frustrating when most conversations with locals end up with them talking about how terrible life in Chile is and what on Earth ever possessed you to come here. It gets old.

4. A lot of foreigners are disappointed because Chile really doesn‚Äôt provide the authentic ‚ÄúLatin‚Äù experience that a lot of them are looking for. Chile is very culturally independent and has a lot more influence from Europe and the US than the rest of Latin America. It is quite different in almost every way from Mexico, the Caribbean, and even the rest of South America. Expats who come seeking spicy food, hot nights on the beach, touristy resort living, and island music will leave empty-handed. 

Pluses:

1. Public transportation is the best I‚Äôve ever seen anywhere in the world. The locals will tell you otherwise, but the Metro subway system and the Transantiago bus system are second to none and the prices are remarkably cheap by world standards. You can get from one side of town to the other with ease and having access to a car is entirely optional. The buses cover almost every street in Santiago and there are multiple subway lines with stations available within walking distance of pretty much everywhere. 

2. You mentioned skiing, from what I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs really good. I never went myself, but I do know they the US Olympic team has trained there often during the summer months and it‚Äôs a popular destination for people who want to take ski trips on a budget.

3. The climate is very mild in Santiago with all four seasons represented equally. Summer can be hot, but the other three seasons all feel exactly as they should, So it‚Äôs very comfortable weather-wise. 

4. There are a lot of great options for living outside of the big cities. If you want to live outside of Santiago, the rest of the country maintains a similar standard of living and you will have access to great services even in more rural areas. A lot of people will recommend the south of Chile, especially places like Valdivia, which feels like a city out of a fantasy novel in the middle of an enchanted green forest. I personally always wished I‚Äôd gone down to Punta Arenas, which has a climate similar to something like Scotland with rocky beaches and gray skies. Seems like it would be a great escape to the end of the world for someone looking for a quiet place to live off the beaten path. 

5. Safety. As others have mentioned there are some issues with petty crime like robbery, but compared to American cities like New York, Chicago, or LA, Santiago is quite safe. The worst that will happen is that someone will snatch your phone if you‚Äôre not careful with it in public or you might get mugged if you‚Äôre downtown at night by yourself. Just use common sense and don‚Äôt advertise that you‚Äôre foreign and you shouldn‚Äôt have any issues.

I do tend to reject the Grey Jedi thing, because what it means is that the Jedi aren't allowed to be diverse. The moment there's an eccentric or unusual character who's a Jedi, they're considered a 'Grey Jedi', distinct from the others.

And I feel that's a shame. There were a lot of interesting and diverse Jedi both in the EU and now. An'ja Kuro, Jon Antilles, Eno Cordova, Quinlan Vos... oddballs who didn't fit the classic mould, but were still respected members of the Order. The Jedi were a diverse brotherhood, more diverse than we really got to see in the movies because so often, we were focusing on the Jedi Council. But even on the Council, some were severe, some were cold, some were grim, some were open-hearted and warm.

And almost all Jedi had some ideas unique to them on how the world was and how the Force was, because that's how the Force is. The Jedi are a mystery-religion at heart, because the only way to *really* learn about the Force is to experience it, and every experience is going to be personal and indescribable to someone else. The idea of being between light and dark... well, *everyone* is, all the time, that's the point.

But as long as you were living a selfless and mindful life, listening for the will of the Force, and working to translate that will into a course that could be compassionate towards other people?

and well those countries responsible for the first letter condemning China and having recognized palestine as a state are  Sweden and Iceland, while in the EU most favour a bi-lateral solution and acknowledgement and will not on their behalf unilaterally recognize palestine, which under no circumstance holds some people here up  to blame them for their constantly ""anti-israel"" position... anyway ... seems one can'T do it right to everyone, perhaps the only solution would be to constantly mimic the three monkeys... nothing seen, nothing said and nothing heard... Do whatever you want...

Apart from the fact that the pro-chinese letter is one of the worst bullshit i had ever read, i think the more dangerous implication is to see how big China's influence in the former colonies and 3rd world states is and steadily increases. This comes not by surprise as China is heavily investing and developing there recently... Of course not in a totally altruistic intention as we can see here... One may wonder why muslim states as malaysia or indonesia haven't published this letter too, well perhaps because they have some dispute going on with china as many of it's maritime neighbours... also as a few israelis lastly had offered some sympathy for Duterte i wonder how they think about the Philipines signing this letter..

There i think the ""west"" has to blame itself for showing no real interest in helping and developing the 3rd world countries in the past and mostly paying lip service.

And one last snarky response... why TF has Israel as a member of the democratic world not signed the first letter i linked? ;)

Meer geld naar recherche en politie om die criminaliteit aan te pakken en meer geld naar reclassering. Daarnaast 2e passport verbieden bijvoorbeeld, of ouders van jeugd beboeten om maar wat te noemen. En religie zou niet via scholen verspreid moeten worden, daar worden tolerantie en belaalde normen en waardsn al vroeg afgeleerd en klusteren kinderen al vroeg samen om er nooit meer uit te komen.

Er wordt juist te veel gerelativeerd dat is het hele probleem. Vrouwen en homos kunnen niet meer over straat zonder zich onveilig te voelen in veel steden, en dan komen sommige gemeentes met een sisverbod, maar dat symtoombestrijding en de landelijke politiek negeert de onderliggende oorzaken, of komt met neppe spierballentaal als foei doe even normaal, ik walg hiervan.  En om de hoek leren kleine kinderen op sommige scholen al jaren allerlei manieren om homos en christenen te vermoorden, gewoon in Nederland. Daarnaast wordt de groep Moslims alleen maar groter, waarvan een zeer groot deel in hun eigen intolerante anti westerse bubbel leven, zonder dat ze willen integreren. In 2060 is voorzichtig geschat dat die groep ongeveer een derde van Nederland is, met huidig beleid. En deze groep is ook al zwaar oververtegenwoordigd in de criminaliteit.. Hoe kan je daar geen problemen in zien? Hoe kan je dit maar relativeren? Hier moet gewoon serieus naar gekeken worden en over oplossingen nagedacht worden ipv. deze groep uit te breiden door alleen maar meer binnen te laten. 

Wilders is verder niet constructief en extreem in zijn uitspraken, en heeft verkiezingsprogramma van een a4tje, dus ik snap voor een deel dat hij genegeerd is. Maar dat wil nog steeds niet zeggen dat er geen echte structurele problemen of zelfs dreiging onderliggend is aan zijn opstelling. Maar voor het grootste deel is hij er niks mee opgeschoten omdat de meesten door zijn geschoten in hun politiek correct denken. We zijn meer bang om minderheden aan te pakken waar nodig dan dat we bang zijn dat als we niks doen het ten koste gaat van de meerderheid of eigen cultuur. Bang om racist genoemd te worden of voor nazis uitgemaakt te worden, als we dat uitdragen. Maar volgens mij is er niks racistisch of facsistisch aan om structurele problemen te benoemen en aan te pakken en je eigen cultuur, waaronder normen en waarden, te verdedigen.

 GREEN TAPE PREVENTS VOLUNTEER RURAL FIREFIGHTERS FROM  REDUCING BUSHFIRE RISK The Volunteer Firefighters Association (VFFA), the body representing the Voice of Volunteer Rural Firefighters in NSW refutes the claim by green alarmists that climate change is the cause of the recent bushfires in New South Wales. 

It‚Äôs ridiculous to blame climate change when we know there has been far worse bushfires  stretching back to the earliest days of European settlement in Australia including the Black Saturday Victoria 2009, NSW Bushfires 1994, Ash Wednesday Victoria 1983, Blue Mountains NSW 1968, Black Tuesday Hobart 1967 and Black Friday Victoria 1939, said Peter Cannon, President of the VFFA. 

The VFFA is angered by comments from the green lobby groups that tackling climate change was more important than prescribed burning of forest fuels to reduce bushfire risk.  The real blame rests with the greens and their ideology as they continue to oppose and undermine our efforts to conduct hazard reduction in the cooler months and to prevent private landowners from clearing their lands to reduce bushfire risk. 

Hazard reduction is the only proven management tool rural firefighters have to reduce the intensity and spread of bushfires and this has been recognised in numerous bushfire enquires since the Stretton enquiry into the 1939 Victorian Bushfires. 

The amount of ‚Äògreen tape‚Äô we have to go through to get a burn approved is beyond frustrating; says Peter Cannon.  The VFFA is calling on the NSW State Government to reduce the amount of green tape involved in planning and conducting hazard reductions, so that our Volunteer Firefighters can get on with the job of conducting fire prevention works in the cooler months to prevent the inevitable summer bushfire disasters that are now becoming a more regular feature. 

The NSW State Government must also provide sufficient funding for bushfire hazard reduction works on a planned and sustained basis, including the creation of asset protection zones and upgrades of all fire trails in high bushfire risk areas. 

Remember that it‚Äôs far more cost effective, say around 66 to 100 times more cost efficient, to prevent wild fires through hazard reduction than it is to have reactionary fire response, which is what we have at the moment. With the great number of lost homes and decreasing property values through these wild fires, what then will the total fiscal amount be‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.when it could have all been prevented by effective Hazard reduction!  

To increase the area treated by prescribed burning on bushfire prone lands from the current level of less than 1% per annum to a minimum of 5% per annum, as recommended by the Victorian Royal Commission and many leading bushfire experts. 

  2	

 ¬†Hazard Reduction by prescribed burning has been identified as a key management tool to reduce the intensity and spread of bushfires in national bushfire enquiries since the 1939 Stretton Royal Commission. In this regard the VFFA supports: 

a) Strategic and targeted hazard reduction by prescribed burning to reduce forest fuel levels and bushfire threat to human life (including fire fighter safety), property and the environment in areas identified as high bushfire risk. 

b) Bushfire risk management planning approach based upon the ‚ÄòCanobolas‚Äô Model in NSW. 

c) Integrated hazard reduction by prescribed burning and complementary methods such as slashing, grazing and cultivation. 

d) The provision of adequate recurrent state and commonwealth funding to rural fire agencies, land management agencies and local government for the creation and maintenance of asset protection zones and fire trails in high bushfire risk areas on a planned and sustained basis. 

e) Ongoing relevant research on fire behaviour, prevention and management and the effects of fire on biodiversity through the bushfire Cooperative Research           30-9-2013                           Ends: Mr. Peter Cannon President VFFA Ph: 0427-697608 E: [petercannon@volunteerfirefighters.org.au](mailto:petercannon@volunteerfirefighters.org.au)  [www.volunteerfirefighters.org.au](https://www.volunteerfirefighters.org.au)

At the time many dismissed it as a flattering comment towards our captain, and many people expressed how unwise that would be if he were serious. Fast forward 8 months and it now appears crystal clear that he was dead serious.

My assessment was that his clear and predictably normal age-driven decline in agility made Cluj a terrible matchup due to their targeting long balls and winning 2nd balls in midfield. Needless to say, Brown was terrible in the tie, and despite all the reasonable hysteria about McGregor being played at left back, it was Brown who was directly responsible for 3 of the 4 goals, including the mindless handball.

Not only has Brown been the centre piece of the team, he's been deployed in a more complex role with greater freedom and more responsibility. He seems to have carte blanche to run all over wherever the heck he wants. Lennon deploying a 4-2-3-1 has resulted in every single one of our midfielders producing worse offensive statistics this season so far vs last season, and this is against a lesser league. Christie has been a 10 and a winger, when his best performances were last season as an 8. Ntcham has been the backup 10 mostly, when he was better last season as an 8. McGregor was massively better last season as an 8 and arguably the best midfielder in the country. This year? Scott Arfield has slightly better combined xG+xA. Brown stats are only marginally worse offensively, but that is from a level that was and is already below the average of all SPFL centre midfielders. In fact, Jullien, Bitton and Ajer all have better offensive numbers from open play than Brown.

So we have a shape which is ill suited for our best midfielders. Brown offers below league average offensive contribution, so surely he must be an elite defensive dynamo to warrant being first pick in almost every game? The defensive data which proxy athleticism and movement are generally worse than his last season under Deila. Things like # of tackles, % of duels won, and % aerial duels won are all down significantly from the 2 good years under the Rat. His number of fouls are also way up, which makes complete sense for an aging player who is just a step or two slower than their mind.

His interception and recover stats remain good to excellent, so when he is able to be in a good position he is excellent at anticipating play, but Lennon's system has resulted in him being way out of position frequently and he has lost the ability to recover. It really is a worst of all worlds.

Point to a single team at a decent level in Europe that has played a player of Brown's profile anywhere near his total number of minutes or even as a % of a team's available minutes. I've looked and no one is close. 

We have a decent comp for Brown on the other side of the city. Rangers have played in almost many games as Celtic, Davis has assist and passing stats which are more than triple that of Brown and among the best for all SPFL midfielders, yet his minutes are WAY below Brown.

In our arguably biggest 9 games of the past 12 months, we've been thoroughly outplayed by Rangers in 5 of 6, barely beat a bad Hearts team in May Final, and lost a tie to a clearly inferior Cluj team that knocked out of CL qualification. The centre point of those failures has been our midfield. Brown is the only player to have played in all those games. He is the captain and between he and the Manager, would share responsibility even if Brown had been a positive standout performer across those 9 games. However, it has been the exact opposite. 

Lennon has unleashed him to run all over the place. The next question is whether that is a role which makes any sense in games when we dominate possession. Also, I haven't even adjusted his stats to account for him playing on a dominant offensive team in the league. Such an adjustment would take his output from below SPFL average to downright pathetic. Davis rarely gets forward and plays centrally for Rangers, yet he has more than triple the offensive output and passing creativity vs Brown. And as we saw Sunday, Davis is no wilting flower defensively either. 

I can't find a single example in Europe where a good team plays a player his age in such a role and anywhere near as much as we do. I am not saying he can't or shouldn't play an important role- like coming on as a sub to help lock down games. And if his intangibles are so important and valuable why have we performed so poorly in our biggest 9 games over the past year? 34 year old midfielders do not get better defensively than the younger versions of themselves. So is a version of Brown who is 15-20% worse than the 2017 version, who offers very little offensively, deserving of automatic first pick in nearly every single game even when he is clearly injured (watch the 1st half of the Hibs semifinal- he was clearly injured and struggling to move around the pitch)?

He has repeatedly been all over the place this season, including playing like a box to box at times against weaker opponents. And if that is his stated role, then why are we in a a 4-2-3-1 which means we'd be completely lopsided in our shape with McGregor getting forward more...which is exactly what happened Sunday. 

Regardless of how one labels it, the shape and where/what he's doing is different under Lennon than what it was under Rodgers. Sunday we had Brown at a pseudo-central 6, McGregor as a left sided 8 and a 10, which completely vacated the right half space in midfield (pretty much the entire first half Sunday). Rodgers had 2 attacking 8's which created a more balanced midfield and deployed Brown as you state- basically a conduit to pass to players who can create. Our right side was completely abandoned Sunday until Ntcham came on.

I think your referencing of the Salzburg games is instructive. Their central midfielder in the game at Celtic park was 22 and right sided midfielder was 20. Their left sided midfielder was 31 and played in all 6 CL group games for them this season, on a team that gave Liverpool a good battle. His total minutes played are a mere fraction of Brown's. Our midfield that day was McGregor, Christie and Rogic, who is probably the one midfielder slower than Brown. 

The 2 holding midfielders Rangers faced vs Porto's 4-2-3-1 at Ibrox? 28 year old who is 6'2 185 lbs and 25 year old who is 6'0 180. Rangers' system and players beat Porto 3-1 ""in aggregate"".

Just scroll through the midfielders of teams around Celtic's level or where we aspire to be. They are dominated by players who are at ages we know scientifically is when men are at their physical peak- 22-28. There are exceptions that push to early 30's but their minutes are reasonable. Copenhagen's midfield 4 played in their last EL game? 22, 25, 26 &amp; 27.

There has not been a single player his age or older who has played on a Champions League team as a defensive midfielder. The closest is Fernandinho at Man City, who is being played at centre half. The last season it was basically de Rossi and he played about half the minutes last season in total than what Brown has already played this season and is now barely playing at age 35 for Boca Juniors. Importantly, if you look at players as old or older than Brown, they haven't been in Champions League sides for over 10 years. 

In Europa League there are only 12 defensive midfielders older than 30 who have played this season. Brown has played in 98% of league minutes and 3125 total minutes across all competitions. Out of the other 12 EL defensive mids the next highest minutes total is 1968 for a 31 year old at Gent, who has played in 83% of their league minutes. There are 4 players Brown's age or older and Brown has played double any of their minutes. 1 each at Besiktas, Cluj and Ludogorets. Valero at Inter has played in only 455 total minutes all season and is 34. The other 3 have played in 77%, 72% and 49% of league minutes for their teams.
 
I went through the squads of 39 clubs that are around Celtic's level or just above where we aspire to be just below the super clubs. The sample of players is 78 and include only 12 over 30 and the 4 I've profiled at or older than Brown. Average age is just under 27, average height is just over 6'1 and average weight is 165 lbs. 

The closest 2 comps I can find to Brown are Junuzovic at Salzburg who is 32 and played 1721 minutes and 62% of league minutes, and Leiva at Lazio with 1258 minutes and 66%. 

Brown's usage is grossly negligent - full stop.

Last thing I will share from the ""dossier"" I've been building for months. I apologize if my posts have been overwhelming- I just find this issue maddening given what we know about sports science, physiology, and there is clear data that Brown is not a purple unicorn. This should be the last of my posts on the topic.

Brown's number of duals per 90 mins played in European games since 2015-2016 (age 30) season have gone: 9.63, 10.2, 8.38, 8.32 and 6.5. Of those duals, he lost the following % each season: 30.4%, 35.5%, 38.8%, 35.9% and 43%. 

There is a reason good teams don't have players his age playing that position and why they stopped playing them there over 10 years ago. He is 30% worse at engaging opposing players and almost 50% worse at winning the duals in which he engages.

USA if they wanted would crush the iranian army with ease, even USMC with airforce domination and SOF help,would be sufficient. So destroying their army is not a problem as i said.The incompetence of iranian army is completely gargantuan, not mentioning the lack of coordination,tactics and equipment. Middle east armies aren't known for their great performance vs what you see with european/US armies. The problem is controlling the territory afterwards. With majority of iranians having unfavourable view of US its hard to imagine how they could win ""hearts and minds"" of the people, thus diminish the insurgency and recurrence of the problem when the us army leave the place.

But still i will try to deconstruct things you've listed:

&gt;Iran has allies in the region that will attempt to raise all hell once the war starts.

Iran is already overextended and funneling massive funds to support their proxies. They will not start any major conflict because they don't have the money. People are already unsatisfied with the taxes and corruption. Even if they would muster enough funds where they can hit US allies? Saudis are already involved with houthis, Israel is impenetrable for iranian proxies. There's not much direction where they can extend their influence to hit US allies.

&gt;Iran has weapons capable of hitting US military bases in the region.

Please don't make me laugh. The Shahab rockets are abysmal, US,Saudi\[with US crew\] and Israeli air defense is enough to  prevent their attacks. US can supply Ticonderoga class cruisers in the persian gulf or mediterranean to intercept their missiles against saudi or Israel.

&gt;Iran can close the Hormuz straits for months. No shipping company sane enough will attempt to sail their cargo through it. Effectively skyrocketing oil prices. In addition to this, you can likely kiss Saudi oil production as the Houthi's will hit any &amp; every oil plant in the region.

Iran will do jackshit with their obsolete anti ship missiles and navy. If US wanted they can bring the whole CSG there, and no iranian missile will slip through.

&gt;EU is going to be pissed. China is going to be pissed. Russia is going to be pissed (though Gazprom executives will laugh all the way to the bank)

Like that will stop Trump if he get a green light from the establishment. Russia is already pissed, China already helps Iran. EU is the most sane party that neither help nor is against Iran and they actually wanted to keep the 2015 nuclear deal. Yes they will be pissed as hell, but mostly because they will have to take the blunt of the crisis -accepting another millions of refugees, because apparently its europe duty xD US will be laughing again how they can meddle in the middle east without the cost on their side, beside military expenditure.

&gt;Not to mention the casualties on the US side, as it's fairly doubtful that there would be a 'coalition of the willing' to join the war.  
&gt;  
&gt;And it's doubtful that they'd ever win the war. Best you could expect is for them to destroy Iranian infrastructure and that's it. Not exactly a scenario you'd call a win, when considering the political (both foreign and local) and material losses.

US can easily assert air and communication dominance, without that iranian army will crumble just like saddam army did. The bulk of casualties were AFTER the war, just as i said in my post -US army would have no trouble winning, but keeping the place would cause great casualties and financial expenditure. Even with the lastest tech that can prevent IED detonations, anti sniper technologies etc. you still can't beat the old trusty SVBIED. US would have to adopt drastic/draconian martial law and completely isolate the movement of individuals. This would of course bring more financial expenditure, more resentment against US, thus even harder way to control the territory without civilian casualties\[what are the us officers gonna do, when thousands of civilians iranians will try to storm their positions? If they shot them, the international media and RT would have a field day\]

&gt;Though most of the discussion now is pointless. When the US navy will start to leave bases in the Persian gulf towards the gulf of Oman or the Arabian sea, that's when you should start getting nervous... To me it just seems like Trump is starting his reelection campaign for the 2020 elections.

I don't understand your argument. US Navy has no problem patrolling persian gulf, and has no intention to move out of there.

That's not the only reason, but that's a big part of it.

The US middle class doesn't exist because our owners are good people. They're not; they're awful, and the middle class is disappearing, and we'll probably find ourselves in violent conflict \[1\] with upper class in the next 20 years. Rather, it exists because of the Cold War (and its legacy). The US and the USSR both generated middle classes because they knew they couldn't win a technological race without tapping a significant fraction of their native talent. (Contrary to what rich people want you to think, intelligence and born social class are nearly uncorrelated, so the bulk of smart people will be born into the largest social class, the proletariat). Once the Cold War ended, the US elite found themselves unaccountable-- they no longer had to prove capitalism a morally tolerable system-- and over time, the economy went to shit and the middle class disappeared. This is happening gradually, but it is what's going on.

The MIC created Silicon Valley. It funds a lot of math and science research. It largely created the Internet. The Cold War, for all its evils, created the momentum on which the technology industry is now coasting.

That said, it's not the case that the MIC raised STEM wages *at the expense* of non-STEM fields. Literature professors aren't underpaid because of the big, bad MIC. Rather, it's the case that if the MIC hadn't bid up STEM talent, STEM professors would be just as underpaid.

If you look at third-world countries, the STEM people don't make any money either... no one gets rich by working. There are owners, and there are workers, and they are two separate sets of people. The American 1940‚Äì2007 period, in which people could get rich by working, was the anomaly. The historical norm is that capital can wait, but labor needs to eat today, and from this power discrepancy, the inevitable result is that labor gets raped in the ass, over and over, until the situation is so unstable that violent conflict (internal or international) emerges to a degree that becomes an existential threat to the elite, at which point they're willing to take a pay cut and allow a strong middle class to exist.

So far, the only thing that has ever given labor a fighting chance is an economically interventionist state‚Äì one that, say, supports rather than crushes unions, levies progressive rather than regressive taxes, and upholds worker rights rather than employer privilege‚Äì and the only situation in which an upper class tolerates such a state is when there's a perceived existential threat (as from 1930‚Äì90) that includes the elite... or in the aftermath of such a period... as in the EU, where the upper class has been slow on the austerity/evil bandwagon compared to its more vicious US counterpart.

And since Chivalry 2 is already announced, it can't be bad to already get familiar with the mechanics (Altough I highly doubt they are gonna keep all the spinning stuff in the sequel, so think twice if you wanna take your time and learn that. But learning parrying, dragging, reading feints, footwork etc. are skills that will also transition to Chiv 2 if you also plan on playing that.)

For youtube videos, I highly recommend Teripper. He doesn't make videos anymore, but his old ones are still up. They are probably the best videos for beginners that want to get into the more advanced stuff. Of course there are also other tutorials that would in theory be better, but they are often too confusing and overwhelming if you are just starting out with the game, so I wouldn't recommend them.

&amp;#x200B;

1.I highly recommend first person

&amp;#x200B;

2.Maybe you saw it in videos that a lot of high lvl players play on ridicoulous FOV's, which what can I say, is true. I myself play (or played) on 145 and lots of other people play on even higher ones. But it's understandable if you don't wanna do that. I would probably recommend 115 or 120 then. That way it doesn't get distorted but you will still see all you need.

&amp;#x200B;

3.I never put my graphics down and if your pc isn't too trash you should probably be fine as well. And you can absolutely be a good player while playing on 115/120 FOV, no problem. You probably do have to learn at least the essentials/basics of the advanced stuff like spinning (that will also help you to play against it).

&amp;#x200B;

4.Not rlly sure what you are asking, but I didn't play too much Team Objective in the first place, so I am gonna skip this point.

&amp;#x200B;

5.Well you only have a small window to parry in the first place, otherwise you get hit (You also have to look directly at your opponent's weapon while blocking for it to work). But if you immediately attack after parrying you do a riposte, which is way faster than a normal attack (This works with any type of attack. Slash, Overhead or Stab, doesn't matter).

&amp;#x200B;

6.No there isn't. However, your stamina loss on a parry depends on the weapon type. You loose way more stamina blocking a maul attack than one from a dagger.

&amp;#x200B;

7.Well if you take all the advanced stuff (spinning, dragging etc.) into account, then clearly Messer. But for beginners it probably doesn't matter that much. I would still recommend a sword tho. Longsword is a really solid allrounder choice, Messer can still be a very good pick, also for beginners. You do lots of dmg with it, but it's also slower. Secondary isn't that important but Norse sword is probably your best choice.

&amp;#x200B;

8.Well, the faster classes mostly also have faster weapons to choose from. So generally you can also expect their swings to be faster.

&amp;#x200B;

9.If you don't wanna do it yourself, then just learning to parry their attacks and riposting is a good option. If they do a reverse overhead for example, you can still block it like a normal attack, you just have to react way faster than normally but once you get familiar with it it's perfectly doable. Now mix up riposting these attacks with not riposting after a parry and wait for them to panic block and you should be good. Also since they need to be directly in front of you to spin, stepping back a bit when you notice them doing it is also a good idea. You can also just feint them, but I don't know if I would recommend feinting if you are just starting out. I would advice you to first learn all the basics, which is consistently blocking, dragging, (combo) feint to parry (which is pretty important, you can probably look up a video on it if you are not sure what I mean) etc. before looking into feints, since they can act like a crutch for beginners. It can get you some quick success, but I have seen too much beginners using feints without being able to consistantly block normal attacks. Also be aware that while nearly all high level players will not have a problem with feints, often medium players (that have the basics down but still get destroyed by good players) will cry about it. Beware tho, even though these are good tips for dealing with spinning, there is a good chance that you will still get destroyed, since often the people doing stuff like spinning etc. have hundreds and hundreds of more hours into the game than you.

&amp;#x200B;

10.When you get used to the basics, then using combos (and not just doing one attack at a time) and being aggressive in general is going to be really important. There are lots of different possibilities especially if you include the advanced stuff, but for the beginning an overhead drag into a stab and then either into another overhead drag or a fast overhead (you can mix it up) is probably really solid.

&amp;#x200B;

11.Well, one year ago there still weren't many players left but in comparison to then the playerbase has declined even further. I don't know if you are in EU or NA but at least in EU you should still have full beginner servers (Level 0-15). After that, you will probably find at least one full Free for All and Team Objective server and like a half full duel server (10-15 people on average). However, a lot of players on non beginner servers are veterans who will destroy you. There really aren't that many average ""decent"" players left. It's mostly beginners to medium players and veterans all with thousands of hours playing. There are also often a couple of people with high ping on the servers, since the game is almost completely dead in NA and the few players then go to the EU servers to play.

13.(At least when the game was still populated,) for me and I guess also for a lot of other people it's still enjoyable even after putting hundreds of hours into it. But that also includes learning all the advacned stuff like spinning, dragging, feinting etc. If you are strictly against that kind of stuff like spinning and don't want to learn it, then you probably won't enjoy it. The thing is you can have 1k hours into the game and still get destroyed by a veteran with say 3k hours. I think after diving into the advanced mechanics, this very steep learning curve and the fact that there is always someone better than you, are/were a big part of the reason why people played this game for countless of hours.

Hope this helped you a bit and even if you decide that you don't wanna put this much time to learn such mechanics on a game that has almost no playerbase left (which would be understandable), you can still have lots of fun with it. At the very least until Level 15 and you can't play on the beginner servers anymore (Alternatively then you could join duel servers and not going into auto-match and only challenging players around your skill level. That can also be pretty fun).",True,False,False,,,0,1578016547,,False,0,{},fcw3vqm,False,t3_ej153a,False,True,t3_ej153a,/r/ChivalryGame/comments/ej153a/chivalry_noob_general_questions/fcw3vqm/,False,,1586979397,2,True,False,ChivalryGame,t5_2vb9k,r/ChivalryGame,public,0,[],

[],,westcoastal,1354303534.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_9rbgl,False,False,[],"People get this wrong all the time. A huge part of the problem is that with privilege the human suffering of others is invisible to you because of your position in the world. I often state it in this way, ""Privilege is when you don't think something is a problem because it's not a problem for *you*."" I would add that privilege is often completely unearned, something that has come about totally by accident of birth.  

The issue isn't just that minorities are mistreated. Everyone is mistreated from time to time, and that is often used as a means of dismissing the experience of marginalized people, or making claims of 'reverse racism' or 'reverse sexism' etc. People say, ""I've been treated badly because I'm white, I've been treated with racism too."" as though there could ever be any sort of equivalency between the two experiences. White people might experience bigotry against them because of their whiteness, but they do not have to suffer under deeply ingrained institutional racism that underlies their day to day existence like people of color do.

There are many complex reasons why our society has such deeply ingrained institutional racism, but it's not hard to understand where some of that came from. I mean, Europeans came here to conquer the land, murder the people living on it and bring in slaves as a sort of human livestock to do all the heavy lifting. They genuinely believed that people of color were mindless savages, little more than animals. The society that was built up out of that had racism at its core. In many ways it still does. 

Sure, slavery was supposedly 'abolished' in the US decades ago, but if you look at American society you can still see it everywhere. You can see it in income inequality and exploitative labour practices, where families can work their asses off at multiple blue collar jobs and still not make ends meet. But there are also more direct, literal forms of slavery. 

Look at the US prison industrial complex, where private corporations profit from the slave labour of incarcerated people, most of whom are marginalized, racialized people. Look at the treatment of Mexicans in your country. In many regions undocumented workers are the backbone of your economy, but they are given no path to  citizenship or 'legitimate' participation in society, and that's by design. Undocumented means 'powerless and easily exploited'. When you think about who does all the shit work Americans are unwilling to do, do you ever wonder about what the experience is for those people? 

In many key ways, their lives aren't much different from the lives of slaves. They are unappreciated, maligned, often abused and exploited. Their movements and opportunities and experiences are greatly limited due to their poverty and undocumented status. They are in many ways at the mercy of the very people who seek to benefit from their labour.

And these people, and people like them across the globe who work in factories with appalling conditions, make it possible for white, middle class people to live their lives of relative comfort and luxury. Yet they are shit upon in every way by mainstream society not just here, but globally. The labour and natural resources of poor and indigenous communities around the globe are used to elevate the lives of those with the ability to take control of the means of production. Corporations come in, take charge of the land and resources, 'employ' the people at a pittance, turn their labour and resources into cheap goods for sale to middle class westerners and the profits all go to the richest 1%.

This is institutional racism at work, and our society is built upon it. When people of color are (whether consciously or unconsciously) dehumanized it makes it much easier to exploit them without a guilty conscience. I remember during the Iraq invasion after 9/11, Americans I talked to were often amazed to hear that Iraqis had previously lived 'normal' lives working in professional jobs, raising families, driving cars, listening to iPods, etc. There is this conceit that 'those people over there live in the dirt and are not like you and I'. It's the same whenever there's a famine or outbreak of disease in some part of Africa. People just don't see and truly internalize the humanity of people who are different from them.

And in day-to-day life it really shows, especially in the US. People of color in the US are dehumanized and often demonized. It shows when a person of color walks into a store and is followed everywhere by security. It shows when a person of color is driving a nice car and gets pulled over and treated like a car thief. It shows when people of color have to be twice as conciliatory and friendly to be considered half as friendly/trustworthy as white people. It shows when any expression of anger or frustration in people of color is treated as threatening. There are countless little ways in which people of color are 'kept in their place' by white people.

The same is true for women who, while not a minority, bizarrely are treated like a minority. Same with LGBTQ people, transgender people, anyone who falls outside the exalted patriarchal straight white middle class norm our society is built around.

One of the easiest ways to understand privilege and how difficult our society makes life for marginalized groups is to look at the day-to-day experience of people who have disabilities or mobility issues. They go out into the world every day and try to navigate a world that is designed to ensure the comfort, convenience and success of able-bodied people. Often that comfort and convenience comes at the expense of the comfort and convenience of people with disabilities. 

Trying to do basic everyday things when the world wasn't built to cater to your needs will rapidly show you just how insidious and painful privilege/marginalization can be. Try getting a table at a restaurant, taking a bus, going to a party, going Christmas shopping, going to the movies, even going to the doctor or dentist, get a cab when you've been out late - think of all the ways in which life is harder when the world wasn't built for you as a blind person, a person in a wheelchair, a person with canes or hearing impairments. 

That's what it's like to be marginalized in society. Then think about all the ways our society gears opportunities, culture, art, media, industry, toward the 'default' straight cis middle class white person - particularly the *male* straight cis middle class white person - and you might start to see your own privilege and understand the daily struggles of others, and their ceaseless fight for equality.",True,False,False,,,1,1578017868,,False,0,{},fcw5vmk,False,t3_ej1ryi,False,True,t3_ej1ryi,/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/ej1ryi/what_is_the_idiots_guide_to_understanding/fcw5vmk/,False,,1586980366,2,True,False,NoStupidQuestions,t5_2w844,r/NoStupidQuestions,public,0,[],

Es gibt genug Beispiele, wo man forschte und pl√∂tzlich mit etwas komplett am Ziel vorbei aber trotzdem einiges ver√§ndern konnte. Beispiel: Viagra. Eigentlich zur Behandlung von Bluthochdruck gedacht, fand man andere interessante Wirkungen. 

Und so k√∂nnte ein zuf√§llig entdeckter Stoff bei der Suche nach Klebstoff die schlimmste Krankheit der Menschheit besiegen.

Und aus dem Grund sollte man Stoffe nicht auf eine lange Liste setzen, oder eine maximalzahl an Stoffen √ºberpr√ºfen lassen, und dann ist erstmal Schluss f√ºr die Firma.

They seemed more occupied with elitism and social/class changes in society (ie. obsessed with industrialization and its fall) than racism, imperialism, western supremacy, crypto-colonialism etc. Meanwhile the majority of students in my program were American (like me) and Canadian and we all were far more genuinely interested and invested in postcoloniality and the decolonization of the field than any of the academics and our few European course mates. All that being said, my shitting on Cambridge is not meant to defend Caro. I think she‚Äôs so fixated on Cambridge for these very reasons‚Äî the exclusivity and elitism. She seems to me a very fake liberal (considering how she‚Äôs been treating vegans calling her out and her ignorance/tone deafness about Jews and anti Semitism) and even potentially a white supremacist at heart. We forget she‚Äôs also NYU educated and NYU is very much like my undergrad institution in the progressive course material. She must‚Äôve encountered the vast corpus of post-colonial scholarship and I suspect one of the reasons she hated NYU was being taught about marginalized communities and according agency to neglected or oppressed voices in art history. That‚Äôs why she left and went to Cambridge.

Primeiro, decida-se. Vc quer trabalhar com infra ou com programa√ß√£o? Dificilmente vc ser√° contratado pra trabalhar nos dois e aprender os dois meia boca n√£o adianta. N√£o sou de infra, ent√£o nessa parte nao posso ajudar muito. Acho programa√ß√£o muito mais interessante, mas √© gosto. Ent√£o vou focar nessa √°rea.

Pra come√ßar, vc precisa estar fazendo curso superior em √°rea de TI ou engenharia. O curso n√£o vai mudar muito como o mercado te v√™ (sempre achei emprego f√°cil e sou formado em engenharia mec√¢nica). Mas estar fazendo um curso te possibilita a entrar numa empresa como estagi√°rio.

O mais importante √© que o curso n√£o vai te ensinar porra nenhuma. Quase nada do conhecimento t√©cnico necess√°rio √© ensinado no curso. Vc pode aprender alguns algoritmos, a saber quando um algoritmo √© melhor que o outro, algumas no√ß√µes de programa√ß√£o orientada a objetos e funcional mas conhecimento t√©cnico espec√≠fico √© muito dificil. Ent√£o vc tem que estudar sozinho e o que vc aprender vai mudar em poucos anos. Vc nunca vai poder parar de estudar.

Comecei como estagi√°rio, aprendi muito na pr√°tica mas s√≥ consegui crescer estudando mais em casa.

No come√ßo pode parecer que vc tem que saber muita coisa (e de certa forma tem) mas isso vem com o tempo e √© menos dif√≠cil do que parece.

Falando especificamente de coisa t√©cnica, vc tem algumas op√ß√µes. Vc pode come√ßar a aprender a fazer aplicativos, front end ou back end. Em algum momento vc vai saber fazer um pouco dos 3, mas √© bom ter mais especialidade em um. Eu sou desenvolvedor back end por exemplo.

Se vc nao sabe nada de programa√ß√£o √© bom come√ßar por linguagens mais tranquilas como Ruby, Python ou Rust. Python talvez seja a mais simples e a mais utilizada das 3 no mercado HOJE. Eu particularmente odeio python mas √© √≥tima pra come√ßar.

Se vc come√ßar e pegar um pouco a manha, estude Orienta√ß√£o a Obejtos. Existe a op√ß√£o de programa√ß√£o funcional mas vejo pouco disso ainda. Acredito que no futuro Funcional possa substituir OO, mas ainda n√£o √© o caso.

Se vc tiver uma no√ß√£o de alguma linguagem e de OO vc j√° t√° na frente de muito estagi√°rio pra conseguir vaga.

Em quest√£o de mercado, existe muita demanda pra web e app. Se vc gosta de Android vc pode aprender Kotlin. Se vc gosta de iOS vc pode aprender Swift. Se quer os dois Flutter √© a op√ß√£o mais recomendada.

Se vc quer trabalhar com front end, React hoje √© a melhor op√ß√£o. Mas ainda existe Angular e Vue que s√£o √≥timas op√ß√µes.

Se quer trabalhar com back, Java ainda √© a linguagem mais utilizada (pelo menos √© o que eu vejo) seguida de Python. Java √© uma linguagem bem complicada, mas √© poderosa.

Eu poderia entrar em mais detalhes de frameworks e tal, mas n√£o acho que valha a pena nesse momento.

Em resumo, vc tem que estudar e se atualizar constantemente. Existem muitas op√ß√µes no campo da programa√ß√£o e pra quem gosta √© uma maravilha. Se vc est√° num curso superior √© f√°cil conseguir est√°gio e mais f√°cil ainda se vc ja tiver estudado um pouco em casa.

QE in the US was not done through printing money. Also, just saving the banks wouldn't be enough to turn a depressed bear market into a bull market. Clearly, if there were serious fundamental weaknesses in the US economy, propping up a few banks wouldn't be enough to rally the prices of **the entire US stock market**.

Hence why European countries cancelled the tax. Plus admin cost of tracking the wealth

A VAT at 5% applied broadly would generate $2.97T over 9 years or $330B/yr. Yang is proposing a 10% VAT. So assuming around a **$660B/yr** revenue, Yang's VAT tax would generate 2.5x Warren's wealth tax a year.

[**Charvaka**, Ancient History Encyclopedia](https://www.ancient.eu/Charvaka/)

&gt; The Charvaka school was **a philosophical movement in India that rejected the traditional religious order by challenging the authority of the Vedas as well as the hegemony the Brahman priests**.

&gt; **Spells, incantations, rituals, even the duties of the four varnas [castes] - all these are nonsense, invented for the livelihood of those destitute of knowledge and manliness**. If a beast slain in the Jvotistoma rite [Vedic ritual] goes straight to heaven, why doesn't the sacrificer offer his father instead? If offerings to priests can feed ancestors in heaven, how is it that that person standing on top of a house cannot be gratified by food served inside? They cannot - because **all such long-distance gratification is buffoonery!**, (Kanekar, 181)

Sure, everyone is allowed opinions.

However, If I wanted to speak with you personally, I would have replied to you.

My post was clearly about a certain brand of common archetype, of which you might or might not be.  Only you would know if that shoe fits.

If that shoe does indeed not fit, then I'm left wondering why you feel the need to justify yourself.

*A note on opinions:  They are subjective, but in your post you sound as if you're proffering objective facts. You speak in absolute terms, ""there is"" ""no support"", these are not ""opinions"", they are conclusions based on your anecdotal evidence, and as such, stated as absolutes, they are somewhat mistaken if not outright wrong. I wouldn't have even brought it up, but since you paint them as opinions to me, I have no choice but to call your excuse of ""opinions"" disingenuous.*


In some places and situations(as the other poster pointed out), some of your post might hold true.

But as stated, *as absolutes*, any counter example proves them false.  There are tons of places and situations where what you said isn't true.

I too have traveled all over the US and even lived in the EU, rural, urban, desert, fully temperate and green, coastal...so I'll offer a rebuttal to your complaints.

___

A lot of the nation lauds the working/middle class as the backbone of america, and is genuine when they do it, which makes this complaint absurd on it's face, no nuance really needed.  Some of the populace of *every* country denigrates the middle class, by no means is that exclisively American^^TM

The other points break down with a bit more effort, but break down nonetheless.

___

Many people in poverty still have access to healthcare.  Not just governmental programs, but charity orgs like *Good Days*, things that exist specifically to help attain expensive or exotic treatments.  Most hospitals have tons of such resources available upon request.  Many will work with customers in regions where they don't get burned too much, such as offering payment plans or even writing off some of the cost right off the top, serving as a go between to Medicare/Medicate and programs like Good Days above.  Also, worthy of note, IIRC, it's illegal to turn away emergency cases, or something to that effect, one would need to do a bit of research.
___

Across america there is a ton of support for families, but it is highly dependent on where you live.  Welfare, charities(secular and religious), loan programs(private, state, and federal), and other community outreach groups.  Even remedial education for adults with ultra poor conditions where they had to leave school(EG Fairly common on Indian Reservations is fairly common).

___

&gt;US is pretty shitty compared to other first-world nations

This is the one that's so vague as to be near useless. Anyone can cherry-pick the worst of one, and the better of the other to ""prove"" the allegation, doesn't make it a fact.

Example: Even in small towns in middle america, there often is a far nicer/cleaner hospital with newer more capable equipement and better educated staff than much of the EU, including larger metro areas in the EU.

If that's a metric that's important to someone, they can use that as an objective measurement of quality.

&gt;my kid has far more opportunity than she‚Äôd ever have had in the US.

Depends on many factors.  The US has some of the best advanced education(which is where opportunity tends to come in, lower education addressed under another comment) in a LOT of fields.  Technical/trade, STEM, medical(including research, which puts the US really high rankings, if not #1, for things like cancer survival rates).  Life expectancy would be a lot better in the US, if more people weren't spoiled and lazy.

As where in the EU, if you really want to be an automative engineer, you might have to literally go to different countries to get the best education and/or jobs.

EG German Engineering is world renown, but if one is destined to be a chef, France or Italy might be a better place.

If one's not adept at picking up languages, there could be some challenges there, not to mention various different customs and laws, not to mention revolts and other political issues that are common.

The US has little to none of those problems even if you move from one coast to the other for better opportunities, same laws for the most part, same language, same customs.  At worst, a trained professional has to learn local standards, eg certifications, zoning codes per city, etc etc.

There's a reason much of the world busts their ass to come to the US not only for education, but for employment.

&gt;education is a joke

K-12 education is sometimes extremely bad.  However, not all of them, it is highly localized.

Note:  It's not exclusively the state's duty to raise your child.  School, at a minimum, is intended to deliver the general basics, not churn out genuis future millionaires.

Choosing something else in the absence of the threat, or worse having to make decisions based on false information because your government is hiding the threat is not proof of intelligence, it's proof of different circumstances.

Conspiracy nut okay.

You've not given any evidence of false information at all, nevermind proof that the data you are using is not false.

&gt;The oddest thing is that you claim to be safer, but you aren't including all of your countries. You are intentionally leaving out 200,000+ intentional homicides in one instance alone.

Because they're not my countries. My country is the UK, although we often see countries like france, German, Switzerland, the Netherlands etc as similar countries.

&gt;One does have to wonder about the intelligence a population that intentionally deleted their history of murders to make themselves feel good while putting themselves at risk for more murders.

YOU LITERALLY DID THIS

&gt;I bet if Americans decided to have a violent purge with hundreds of thousands of casualties (or six million) every couple of generations we might be so traumatized that we'd act like Europeans too. I'll take a higher base crime rate over mass slaughter, though. I also hope we'd be smart enough not to call ourselves more peaceful and sweep the slaughter under the rug.

I mean you literally attempted a continent wide genocide mate.

&gt;For once, an intelligent thought. Yes. It isn't access to guns that matters. Great job you turned a rusty cog, keep going, free the entire mechanism

&gt;We have addressed it. Banning guns is refusal to address the underlying causes of mass shootings. Stupid dodges like that is how your shithole got paranoia over knives, put up car barriers, and has more bombings

Most of Europe has a fair amount of guns. Austria, Finland, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland have about 30 civilian guns per 100 people. France, Germany, Greenland, Luxemburg, and Sweden have about 20 civilians guns per 100 people. For reference the us has 120 per 100 and it is suspected that the Swiss are probably closer to 40.

Noone is suggesting you ban guns. It's just you obviously aren't addressing the underlying problems. If you take a look at Switzerland you can see the difference. The swiss require permits, detailed background checks and you can only carry it outdoors if you are hunting, doing a historical demonstration, or a security personnel.


&gt;Guns aren't the underlying cause of violence, and your focus on ""mass shootings"" is just stupid ass cherry picking.

Guns increase the casualties massively. They act as a power magnifier. 

&gt;I don't care if a mass murderer uses guns, or cars, or bombs, or toxic chemicals, or acid or something we haven't even thought of.

In most countries you have more regulations on all of that. 

&gt;I care about ideas that will stop the mass murderer. 

You haven't implemented any. I care about making it so that the mass murderer can't commit mass murder. You must agree that it is easier to commit mass murder with a bunch of guns than it is to with a knife. 

&gt;You obviously don't, you just want to disarm people, and your motive at that point clearly is not the intention of stopping mass murder or you would have chosen something relevant.

Your mass murders are literally committed with firearms.

As pointed out by others, it makes little sense for them to be paid equal to their male counterparts, as female players simply aren't as good and don't create as much value for their respective companies. Gender should have nothing to do with it.

Just because men and women receive unequal pay in a given profession does not mean that there is a prejudice at play. If that was true, then we should be rallying around the male models who are being paid less than female models who do the same job. However, in that case, males simply don't/can't create the same economic value... and so equal pay would not make sense. Or, maybe, to take it one step further and get less politically correct, maybe we should be concerned that white basketball players are making less than black basketball players... Or, for that matter, how come I wasn't paid to play soccer even though I was better than many professional/international women's players?

In club football, roughly speaking, female players will either \[a\] receive a ""subsidized"" wage from a club that makes its money from its Men's team (e.g., big European teams) or \[b\] receive a viable wage based on the economic success of their team (e.g., NWSL, I assume).

While it's not discussed, I assume that this less-direct economic question is the answer, here: Regardless of how you cut it, the men's teams are economic powerhouses, relative to the women, and provide far more benefits to their respective countries and corporate stakeholders (e.g., kit sponsor).

Why Allah ÿπÿ≤ Ÿà ÿ¨ŸÑ created us if he knows that we will either go to heaven or hell ?

Allah knew before you answered, that you would answer and that would or wouldn't stray away from him, yet he let you. Why ? Because he wanted your answer, had you been confronted with your future, you may have retracted, and then there would have been no test, as if the angels were walking beside us, nobody would ever dare to sin, but that would all be fake. It isn't much about God launching you in this existence, as much as it's about you gambling : Do you want to be a non-existent being, or would you prefer to come to this earth, were you will face countless challenges and temptations, but at the end of it, if you come out of it as a muslim (ie somebody who submitted truly to his will), you will be rewarded beyond your wildest hopes.

Now, I gave the point view about ""Why we are here ?"" for us, but God's also answered the question ""Why we are here""? for him, and the answers are : To worship him as every other creature, but also to take care of/be in charge of earth, the arabic word ÿÆŸÑŸÅ means primarly to succeed but that doesn't tie well with Islam, so taking care of earth seems like a good translation for me, and it means not only protecting earth, but also building great civilisations, striving towards a better tomorrow and in short : Spread good.",True,False,False,,,0,1578041719,,False,0,{},fcwxesb,False,t3_ej5m9u,False,True,t3_ej5m9u,/r/islam/comments/ej5m9u/im_an_atheist_and_i_want_to_learn_about_islam/fcwxesb/,False,,1586993669,1,True,False,islam,t5_2qhbp,r/islam,public,0,[],

Yes, but if you're hired as a strategy consultant to achieve political wins and you achieve those political wins, you are in fact doing well in your core competency. If by virtue of being competent you are moved into areas of greater and greater authority, it speaks well of you if you seek to get people to assist you in managing your new responsibilities. 

Excepting that he's an adviser to the PM and not an elected official himself, Dominic Cummings is following the same pattern virtually every victorious politician does.

&gt;I would have expected them to disagree with EU policies X,Y,Z, and leaving was a precondition for doing X1, Y1 and Z1. After all, if the new policies aren't written yet, leaving may not be necessary to implement them.

Insofar as I can tell, leaving the European Union was not a technocratic decision made by people who judged the value of x policy versus y policy. It was a decision made by a number of people who valued a number of things - several of them being things like freedom of movement into their country (which they didn't like), and another being sovereignty. Membership in the European Union was fundamentally at odds with those core values - you can't both give up part of your sovereignty to a supranational pseudo-state *and* keep it.

Maybe you don't agree with those core values, but it seems obvious enough that the point of disagreement wasn't about policy X or policy Y, but about the control and sovereignty Britain had over its policy and borders.

Todo el 'scouting' que podais hacer laboralmente antes de dar el salto es muy importante y √∫til. El trabajo en este pais est√° muy fragmentado. La temporalidad es alt√≠sima y tener un contrato indefinido no significa nada porque el despido es una nada.

De todas formas, si ha estado 2 a√±os y sigue queriendo optar a la nacionalidad espa√±ola debe:

* Probar que ha estado los 2 a√±os
* Probar que no tiene antecedentes penales **en Argentina.**
* Certificado de nacimiento
* Certificado de nacimiento del c√≥nyuge (europeo)
* Certificado de matrimonio en el pa√≠s donde se celebr√≥
* Copia de NIE propia
* Copia de NIE o DNI de c√≥nyuge
* Justificante de haber realizado la prueba de 'Espa√±olidad' en el Instituto Cervantes (Creo que son 80 euros, en su caso no tendr√≠a que hacer el examen de castellano porque es argentino). Caduca a los dos a√±os.

And if its negotiators need inspiration from history, they should look to Britain‚Äôs own record of far-sighted compromise.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;Dutch-speaking Boers fought a vicious war from 1899 to 1902.  
&gt;  
&gt;Not only did the victorious British hand the Boers millions to rebuild their towns and cities, but we gave them self-government within five years and allowed South Africa to become an independent dominion in 1910, ruled by men who had once led the Boer armies.  
&gt;  
&gt;As so often, such a fair-minded, far-sighted policy paid for itself. Within just a few years, South Africa‚Äôs fighting men were contributing bravely to the Allied effort in World War I, standing alongside the very men who had once been their enemies.

What a lack of historical understanding..... LOL

First of all, the Empire fought against two countries in southern Africa in those wars, not one. One of the two happened to be called South Africa. What happened in 1910 is that those two occupied/colonised countries formed an union with two British colonies to form a new country, also called South Africa. But over 50% of that new country had always been loyal to Britain. Hence a lot of support for Britain in the WWs.

So when WWI came along, some of the Boer generals, like Smuts (who was actually deputy to Churchill in WWII and second in command of the British forces), did opt to fight for Britain for what ever reasons. A likely one being to unite the country, especially the British bits, behind them. But others rebelled and sided with Germany. And the first post WWII President or PM of South Africa who didn't spend WWII in a prison camp due to pro German leanings, was de Klerk in 1989. After all, he was only born in 1936 and too young at the time. Add to that the fact that South Africa became a Republic in the 60 shows how little long term effect the victory had on British influence. As usual, Britain won the war, but lost the peace that came afterwards (including the two colonies it had before the war) Britain was out manoeuvred by the Boers in the long run. And today, South Africa is a lot closer to the EU the to Britain in more ways than one.

Tonal harmony - ""chords"" - was a peculiar invention of a specific European culture and class at a specific time - around 300-400 years ago.  No other music in the world, or at any other time, uses anything like it.  They all use melody, rhythm, timbre, form.  While ""harmony"" occurs - naturally - when pitches coincide, only those bizarre Europeans (for their own religious/aesthetic purposes) developed an entire system of ""functional organisation"", in which chords really did seem to have a purpose *other than* form and melody.  Even if their function could be seen as helping to define form and enhance melody, they also seemed to have a life of their own.    

The demands of tonality actually require strict limits on how melody and timbre work.  Scales types are reduced to a tiny handful, and pitches need to be fixed to a crude tuning system.  Timbre is relegated to an expressive effect.  Rhythm is also simplified, tamed.  From the perspective of other world music, this is like a tightly buttoned straitjacket.  For harmony to soar, to do its wondrous thing, melody and rhythm need to be kept in a cage.   Naturally, those Europeans thought those strictures were worth it.  Even (perhaps) God's will.

So it's no wonder that European theorists got so obsessed with harmony, the way any physics scientist would get obsessed with the industrial revolution.  This is ""*our thing*"" - a mark of ""civilisation"", or European ""progress"".   There's a definite sense of cultural pride, even arrogance sometimes.  (If no other world music does this, it means it's *inferior* or *primitive*.)  It's no accident - IMO - that the zenith of classical and romantic music (the apotheosis of tonal theory) coincided with the peak of European imperial and technological power.

The last 100 years has seen it all break down, with tonality surviving in popular music as a kind of nostalgic relic of the good times.  Meanwhile, the music of the ""African diaspora"" - created by slaves and their descendants from a free-wheeling mix of African and European folk styles with merely a disrespectful dash of tonality - has, with a beautiful irony, shown Europeans how to be free of their authoritarian heritage.

In this example with Harbleu, it could very well have nothing to do with what he can/cannot play or even his skill level.  There are other factors he would potentially have to address and fix in order to get a slot.

So what is the current situation in OWL and what does Harbleu bring to the table?  And what is he not bringing that would make him more attractive to teams? That's a question he needs to be asking so he can better align himself to being what is called 'sexy' in marketing speak.

1) The trend is currently going toward Korean players more and more. We've seen the percentage of Korean players increase every season, especially this season with Paris and Mayhem dropping their Western squads.  So already Harbleu will have to show the standards that are more prevalent in Korean players than Western (which we can argue about forever, but I get the the impression it has to do with work ethos, more emphasis on team play, and focus. In other words, consistency and reliability.   Streaming does show a good work ethic with Harbleu but playing in comp is so completely different than playing in P2P.  As such, streaming is more for gaining viewers/fans than it is for showcasing skills to OWL.  Top level play is about planning, strategy, communication, and teamwork - something you can't get when you get random team mates each game.

2) Of those making it to OWL this year (especially from EU) the trend was for 'young and talented' rather than more established and experienced players.  Unlike endemic tournament play (where orgs want bigger 'names' to bring in viewers and fans), league play is about localized fans cheering on their home city.  As such, it's not about bigger names and the viewers don't necessarily come from there (I think Dafran's fanbase coming to cheer Atlanta was an outlier).  It's not about youth skills being better than mature skills; rather, it's that youth can be developed, indoctrinated, molded, and then resold for years - as an investment.  It's much harder to sell an experienced player who won't give you potentially years worth on your investment in him. If you look at who is left in the league from the legacy endemics pre-OWL, there are not a lot.  Many ended up benched the first season or by the end of the second season, sent back to Contenders.  So Harbleu also has to dispel the issues with him being a legacy player and the legacy players not living up to expectations (which is a whole different discussion).

3)  History and reputation can be a huge decider on whether someone gets a trial.  I don't know if Harbleu has been vastly unlucky or what, but his troubles with endemics go back to Complexity and travel through NRG, Chicken Contendies, and now Grunto.  First the whole issue with complexity and Harbleu defending teammates who were caught cheating in other games and then having an org (TSM) dump the team immediately after signing. NRG, when he joined, grossly underperformed and had vocal detractors about it.  Chicken Contendies had serious internal issues that leaked out into the rumor mill.  And the Grunto as well appeared to have issues.  So Harbleu will have acquired a taint that makes it very hard to be attractive to potential scouts - malcontent seems to follow him.  Scouts will always be asking the question, ""Is he really that unlucky or does he contribute to the issues of these teams?""  There may be rumors or impressions still out there that Harbleu has to face down and dispel or no team will ever show an interest in him.

Those were some things off the top of my head that seem to be dogging him.  I highly suspect that he is not having issues getting into OWL due to what he does and do not play.  Nor how well he plays.  As with so many legacy players, I can't help but feel that there is a prejudice against them right now due to a long history of conflicts and interpersonal issues, reputation loss, suspect dedication, and missing attractiveness.",True,False,False,,,0,1578048259,,False,0,{},fcx2g6p,False,t3_ej9j5g,False,False,t3_ej9j5g,/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/ej9j5g/harb_and_owl_tryouts/fcx2g6p/,False,,1586996098,18,True,False,Competitiveoverwatch,t5_34fcy,r/Competitiveoverwatch,public,0,[],

When it comes to africans being enslaved because of their skin color, that's also slightly iffy from a historical PoV. Africans were enslaved en masse because european colonizers needed the physical labor particularly in the new world, and african slaves provided that. Now, slavery was not a popular thing in europe at that time, as it was seen as inherently immoral, so A LOT of racist reasoning for why it was okay to enslave africans was manufactured. Even this didn't completely fly, and the english for example decreed that there would be no slavery in england, that any slave owned by anyone at all who would set foot in england would become a free man. It didn't pan out that way, however, especially in the colonies that were very far away from england itself, and the racist arguments created to justify slavery significantly impacted the perception of africans in the eyes of the europeans. We must remember that while africans were pretty much always seen as exotic and strange in europe, they weren't seen as outright lesser (well, they often were, but not to the extent they would later be). The romans had a black emperor and all, which I'm not sure is super relevant but I think its also interesting.

So, even if the skin-color of the slaves wasn't exactly the reason for their enslavement, it became a central part of the justification of slavery: it all became mixed up, and from a modern point of view, the point of view of the legacy of the trans-atlantic slave-trade and of slavery in the americas, it's almost inconsquential as to what the root reasons for the slaves being black was: the socio-economic and cultural consequences are pretty much the same as they would be had the whole ordeal been initially motivated by race.",True,False,False,,,0,1578048880,,False,0,{},fcx2xfz,False,t3_ejbn81,False,False,t1_fcx1ol4,/r/FragileWhiteRedditor/comments/ejbn81/they_think_oppression_is_some_sort_if_competition/fcx2xfz/,False,,1586996320,24,True,False,FragileWhiteRedditor,t5_mcrlm,r/FragileWhiteRedditor,public,0,[],

It's an interesting question, given the aircraft's proclivity for speed, but there really isn't one number to give, as the jet would always give you a little more speed if you wanted it to. It was common to see 35 miles a minute. Because we flew a programmed Mach number on most missions, and never wanted to harm the plane in any way, we never let it run out to any limits of temperature or speed. Thus, each SR-71 pilot had his own individual ‚Äúhigh‚Äù speed that he saw at some point on some mission. I saw mine over Libya when Khadafy fired two missiles my way, and max power was in order. Let‚Äôs just say that the plane truly loved speed and effortlessly took us to Mach numbers we hadn‚Äôt previously seen. So it was with great surprise, when at the end of one of my presentations, someone asked, ‚Äúwhat was the slowest you ever flew the Blackbird?‚Äù This was a first. After giving it some thought, I was reminded of a story that I had never shared before, and relayed the following.  

I was flying the SR-71 out of RAF Mildenhall, England , with my back-seater, Walt Watson; we were returning from a mission over Europe and the Iron Curtain when we received a radio transmission from home base. As we scooted across Denmark in three minutes, we learned that a small RAF base in the English countryside had requested an SR-71 fly-past. The air cadet commander there was a former Blackbird pilot, and thought it would be a motivating moment for the young lads to see the mighty SR-71 perform a low approach.  

No problem, we were happy to do it. After a quick aerial refueling over the North Sea , we proceeded to find the small airfield. Walter had a myriad of sophisticated navigation equipment in the back seat, and began to vector me toward the field. Descending to subsonic speeds, we found ourselves over a densely wooded area in a slight haze. Like most former WWII British airfields, the one we were looking for had a small tower and little surrounding infrastructure. Walter told me we were close and that I should be able to see the field, but I saw nothing. Nothing but trees as far as I could see in the haze. We got a little lower, and I pulled the throttles back from 325 knots we were at. With the gear up, anything under 275 was just uncomfortable. Walt said we were practically over the field‚Äîyet; there was nothing in my windscreen. I banked the jet and started a gentle circling maneuver in hopes of picking up anything that looked like a field. Meanwhile, below, the cadet commander had taken the cadets up on the catwalk of the tower in order to get a prime view of the fly-past. It was a quiet, still day with no wind and partial gray overcast. Walter continued to give me indications that the field should be below us but in the overcast and haze, I couldn't see it.. The longer we continued to peer out the window and circle, the slower we got. With our power back, the awaiting cadets heard nothing. I must have had good instructors in my flying career, as something told me I better cross-check the gauges. As I noticed the airspeed indicator slide below 160 knots, my heart stopped and my adrenalin-filled left hand pushed two throttles full forward. At this point we weren't really flying, but were falling in a slight bank. Just at the moment that both afterburners lit with a thunderous roar of flame (and what a joyous feeling that was) the aircraft fell into full view of the shocked observers on the tower. Shattering the still quiet of that morning, they now had 107 feet of fire-breathing titanium in their face as the plane leveled and accelerated, in full burner, on the tower side of the infield, closer than expected, maintaining what could only be described as some sort of ultimate knife-edge pass. Quickly reaching the field boundary, we proceeded back to Mildenhall without incident.  


We didn't say a word for those next 14 minutes. After landing, our commander greeted us, and we were both certain he was reaching for our wings. Instead, he heartily shook our hands and said the commander had told him it was the greatest SR-71 fly-past he had ever seen, especially how we had surprised them with such a precise maneuver that could only be described as breathtaking. He said that some of the cadet‚Äôs hats were blown off and the sight of the plan form of the plane in full afterburner dropping right in front of them was unbelievable. Walt and I both understood the concept of ‚Äúbreathtaking‚Äù very well that morning, and sheepishly replied that they were just excited to see our low approach. As we retired to the equipment room to change from space suits to flight suits, we just sat there-we hadn't spoken a word since ‚Äúthe pass.‚Äù Finally, Walter looked at me and said, ‚ÄúOne hundred fifty-six knots. What did you see?‚Äù Trying to find my voice, I stammered, ‚ÄúOne hundred fifty-two.‚Äù We sat in silence for a moment. Then Walt said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ever do that to me again!‚Äù And I never did.  


A year later, Walter and I were having lunch in the Mildenhall Officer‚Äôs club, and overheard an officer talking to some cadets about an SR-71 fly-past that he had seen one day. Of course, by now the story included kids falling off the tower and screaming as the heat of the jet singed their eyebrows. Noticing our HABU patches, as we stood there with lunch trays in our hands, he asked us to verify to the cadets that such a thing had occurred. Walt just shook his head and said, ‚ÄúIt was probably just a routine low approach; they're pretty impressive in that plane.‚Äù Impressive indeed. Little did I realize after relaying this experience to my audience that day that it would become one of the most popular and most requested stories. It‚Äôs ironic that people are interested in how slow the world‚Äôs fastest jet can fly.

	For evidence that a landmark trade deal with the EU has not so far lived up to the hopes of Canada‚Äôs farmers, just ask True North Foods.

The beef processing plant in the Canadian prairies spent a year and C$100,000 to gain certification to export to Europe, lured by the prospect of a lucrative market.

But since then True North has sent just one beef shipment to the EU, which it completed in a single day in July.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not all that motivated to send anything to Europe at the moment,‚Äù said Calvin Vaags, the plant‚Äôs owner, who is overburdened by demand from North America. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a new market and it takes a lot of work.‚Äù

Implemented in 2017, the EU‚Äôs trade agreement with Canada ‚Äî Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, or Ceta ‚Äî was the biggest in the bloc‚Äôs history and eliminated 98 per cent of bilateral tariffs. But two years on the deal has been less fruitful than many Canadians expected.

Overall EU exports to Canada rose 11 per cent in 2018 from a year earlier, while imports from Canada rose 7 per cent. Canadian agricultural exports to the EU, however, fell 15 per cent.

The imbalance stems partly from stringent European standards banning antibiotics and growth enhancement technology, Canadian meat industry bodies and farmers told the Financial Times. Farmers must have their methods endorsed by EU-certified veterinarians, who are in short supply in the Canadian west.

Bob Lowe, an Alberta cattleman who uses growth enhancement, said that despite the initial excitement, he had not yet seriously considered ditching the money-saving technology to sell EU-certified beef. ‚ÄúIf it doesn‚Äôt work in our scenario, then we won‚Äôt change,‚Äù he said.

Canada‚Äôs mixed experience could prove instructive for the UK, whose prime minister, Boris Johnson, has touted a ‚ÄúCanada-plus‚Äù arrangement for Britain‚Äôs trade relationship with the EU, based on Ceta.

    This negotiation took many years‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚ÄâAnd, yes, we don‚Äôt like exactly where we are at
    Senior Canadian trade official

While the Canada deal has been held up as an example of how a single country can negotiate trade terms with the EU, the reality has been more complex.

A vast new market was a selling point of the deal, but export quotas ‚Äî the caps placed on the amount of different goods that can be shipped within a given period ‚Äî tell a different story. Canadian pork farmers filled just 1.5 per cent of their export quota in 2018. Cattlemen filled 3.1 per cent of theirs in 2018 and have netted just C$16m ($12.2m) from Ceta in the first nine months of 2019, far below initial expectations of $600m annually. By contrast, European fine cheese exporters have filled their export quota to Canada. 

‚ÄúThis negotiation took many years, and it was actually the last Conservative government that negotiated those market access elements,‚Äù a senior Canadian trade official said. ‚ÄúAnd yes, we don‚Äôt like exactly where we are at.‚Äù

The US is the primary destination for Canadian meat. Canada‚Äôs farmers find that the disparity between American and European standards makes it hard to sell meat profitably to both.

Unable to ignore the market on their doorstep, British farmers too might struggle to fill shelves both in Europe and further afield after Brexit under a Ceta-style agreement.

‚ÄúIf [EU] standards are significantly different [from those in] your largest market, the US‚Äù, that is a major drawback, said Carlo Dade, director of the Trade &amp; Investment Centre at the Canada West Foundation. ‚ÄúYou can understand why a farmer making a rational decision might look elsewhere.‚Äù

While Canadian farmers have struggled to reap the benefits of Ceta, other industries, from pharmaceuticals to vehicles, have prospered. In the year to date, Canada has sent 368 per cent more aluminium to the EU than in the 12 months before Ceta.

Canadian consumers are also benefiting after double-digit duties disappeared on European food and clothing.

‚ÄúI believe European businesses have benefited more from Ceta than Canadian businesses,‚Äù said Christian Sivi√®re, a Canadian trade expert and consultant.

Trade in services between Canada and the EU is up 11.7 per cent compared with two years ago. But without single-market building blocks, from free movement to an integrated court system, there are still restrictions. A local licence is still required for the provision of services under Ceta, hindering seamless cross-border business.

However, that may not remain the case. The agreement‚Äôs most-favoured nation clause means that if Europe offers another partner, such as the UK, greater financial services access, then it must offer the same to Canada. That could prolong EU-UK negotiations, which will focus on services, as member states balk at unintended concessions to Ottawa.

Ratification is another issue. Ceta has been ratified by only 14 European countries and will only take full effect when all EU member states ratify it. That has not always come easily. In 2016, the Belgian region of Wallonia almost nixed the entire deal. Last year, the Italians threatened not to ratify.

‚ÄúThese things will not torpedo the whole deal,‚Äù said the Canadian official. ‚ÄúBut they will delay it because you need to wait for the right timing and supportive governments.‚Äù 

That throws doubt on Mr Johnson‚Äôs pledge to negotiate a deal by December 2020, despite his recent resounding electoral victory.

The sense among many in Canada is that the EU, with millions more consumers, is able to call the shots. For Britain, which is short of trade negotiators and hoping to cut numerous deals simultaneously, that may be a warning sign.

It's almost as if they're a suicide cult. They came 5th in the Euro elections. They got 1 seat in the general election (won by an MP who criticises and distances himself from the party, and who they tried to get rid of). They were even responsible for half of all the Labour party's lost deposits across the UK. If Scottish Labour were an animal, the humane thing to do would be to put it down.

When it comes to Scotland, the main party have been ignorant and tone-deaf for longer than I can remember. The submissive Scottish branch has spent years meekly taking orders from them; blindly following strategies that paid no consideration to Scotland during the planning stages. As a result, they have continually set themselves up for failure. They only have themselves to blame for not standing on their own feet and treating Scotland as a country in a multi-nation setup.

What's worse for the distant Scottish tentacle, is that the problem has only deepened as the London-centric party has increasingly succumbed to myopia; so much so that it has now lost the north of England and will likely be out of power for another 10-15 years. Why do SLAB continue to shackle themselves to them? They have no respect for, or understanding of politics outside of London, and they're clearly quite prepared to see their northern colleagues, across the UK, lose their jobs.

Labour aren't a contemporary party. They have nothing in common with successful modern, left, social democratic parties of Europe. They are a London student hipster collective, with poverty nostalgia and outdated views about class. They don't want to help people help themselves, they want to parent them. They think they can buy 'the poor' with promises of free stuff, while also lecturing and reprimanding them in an attempt to modify their social behaviours and correct them on their views. They love the idea of a Britain that doesn't exist anymore; one they had a place in and in which they made sense as an entity. They put out party political broadcasts featuring closed factories and miners, but wouldn't know how to communicate with those folk if they met in a working man's club - they'd probably end up calling them racists or something.

[They have lost their place and purpose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur8uXCVN7RE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=261). The red wall has fallen. They have failed to modernise. The former strongholds of Scotland and the north of England are not only both different places than they once were, but they have also drastically diverged from each other. There's no solidarity between pro-EU, pro-independence working class Scots and their English counterparts; who complain about subsidising us while rallying behind Boris and Farage. Scottish Labour are on life support, and their plan for future resurrection involves continuing to tie themselves to a terminally ill and contagious patient. It's absolutely bonkers.

It is also surprising how the people who are in favour of Sharia law, haven't attacked after the Ayodhya Verdict, given that most of these people don't worry about themselves dying while attacking, as they are expecting 72 virgins in heaven.

The potential terrorists will have access to funds( the same way they have access to funds for weapons) to bribe officials into giving them citizenship.

Also, Europe can't finance the detention centers for Muslims, how will India do it? America spent over a trillion-dollar over 20 years, but couldn't remove the Taliban! Indian economy is only double that, and the number of Muslims in India is 200 million.

You are correct that there is a temporal difference between the VOC and the disappearance of Portuguese exported copper noted by terminus_trant: however that was not my suggestion, which was rather that the Portuguese chose to acquire copper from Japan either directly or indirectly through Chinese (primarily Fujianese and Cantonese merchants in residence in Vietnam, Malacca and Manila) instead of lugging it from Europe.  While the bulk of Portuguese purchases from Japan was silver for trade with China, copper was one of the other exports although I do not have any hard data on how much there was.  Chinese merchants and later Japanese Red Seal ships also brought similar goods from Japan especially during the on-off ban of silver exports imposed by the Japanese shogunate.  

While you are correct that the Ming did shift away from copper coinage in favor of silver as a currency, it was a gradual process starting from the early 1500s and was primarily driven by the shuttering of Chinese copper mines in the 1400s that made new minting difficult.  Copper coinage however remained a significant trade currency within China alongside silver, in effect a bimetallist currency regime existed within Ming China and whatever copper was produced (and then some) was consumed for domestic purposes rather than exported.  

One other thought would be the arms trade with China and Japan.  That is to say, both nations were highly interested in Western firearms and bought them as finished goods in large quantities.

To clarify, I didn't mean that Marxist-Leninist analysis, as in the scientific approach to societal woes etc, was incompatible with the Inca conditions, more that certain aspects of theory would be completely inapplicable to their circumstances. For example, I don't think that the labor theory of value would apply, as that theory is really only applicable to capitalism and to a lesser extent lower phases of socialism. I think a dialectical-materialist analysis would be fully applicable however. 

I see their version of socialism being wholly different from one emerging from capitalism. Every economic system bears the birthmarks of the system it rises out of. If capitalism never arose in Inca society, whether a different system replaced the one they had before the socialist revolution or not, their socialism would be focused on resolving the contradictions of their society and building towards communism with those relations in mind. 

I think this conversation is very interesting to have, because it may reveal a problem with the current socialist movement. We talk about how Marx's historical materialism is quite eurocentric, yet we never really confront this idea, and more move on after it is said. The path of Primitive Communism &gt; Slave society &gt; Feudalism &gt; Mercantilism &gt; Capitalism &gt; Socialism &gt; Developed Communism is most likely not the only path to an advanced Communism. 

The idea that feudal societies in China, Arabia, Turco-persia, India, Austronesia, Abyssinia, et cetera would develop inevitably into a capitalism recognizable to our current understanding of it is almost saying ""The European version of class development is the correct and only way."" 

Other than being simultaneously racist and orientalist, the biggest problem with this mode of thought is that it leads us to be overly deterministic in our methods. In my opinion, a socialist country emerging from a colonized nation will have a radically different economic path than one emerging from the imperial core. 

For example, Latin America is a region that has been in colonized conditions for about 300 years from its inception as a society in itself. Should this  region take a planned approach or a more state-capitalistic approach? I think this is a false dichotomy. The primary contradiction in this society is between the colonizer class and the colonizer class. An independent economic system needs to be organically developed and then a new dialectical-materialist analysis needs to be formed to move from these relations towards communism. The same could be said for the rest of the colonized world, except of course colonization takes different forms in different places, so there will of course need to be nuances in their approaches. 

The reason I see this mindset to be incredibly dangerous and an inherently malign contradiction is because there's a trend of thinking we can do fully-automated luxury gay space communism, and not really thinking about the drastic decolonization efforts that need to be undertaken. I could see a proletarian revolution occurring in the imperial core, and colonialism continuing. For instance, what if between 1917 and 1940 France had had a socialist revolution? Anti-colonialism was not a major force in the movement. Of course there are figures such as Ho Chi Minh, but I could see France becoming a form of social-imperialist, in the sense that they might build communism off the backs of their colonized subjects. 

This could very well be what happens in the modern world if we are not careful. Even if a global socialist revolution occurs, the current imperial core will be inherently more advanced in production, infrastructure, etc, and may create another class society of the west over the rest.

Casualties from this can surely be estimated to be unacceptably severe, and the likelihood that such an attack would occur is small.  However, this is the attack that has the greatest chance of ending hostilities with a ‚Äúvictory‚Äù (depending on our definition of the word) in the shortest timeframe - the problem is that it will also be the costliest in terms of lives and equipment.  After all, I have only given the difficulties faced in *staging* such an attack - not *executing* it to its conclusion.  Once such an attack kicked off, our forces would be operating in hostile terrain with long, exposed supply columns and no air umbrella, which we have not done since Korea or arguably since the European Theatre of WWII.  It could get quite bad, and could go on for a very long time.  The only bright spot in this picture is that once the government falls, we will have almost total air &amp; ground superiority, though there is a large amount of quite sophisticated MANPADS and anti-tank equipment in the area which guerrilla fighters would harass us with indefinitely - meaning that we would be conducting a *mostly* peaceful occupation of an area stretching from the western border of Turkey to the eastern border of Tajikistan.  

That is a *shit*load of ground to cover, folks.  There‚Äôs a whole lot of places to hide, and a lot of people within who would be willing to fight to the death to kick us out, and it makes our case to the international community that this is Just War and not imperialist aggression pretty fucking tough, especially as the occupation stretches out over decades.  Let‚Äôs not forget that the occupation of Afghanistan is now old enough to fuck with no end in sight despite the last two Presidents from radically different ‚Äúsides‚Äù and for totally different reasons pledging to end it, and (so far at least in the case of Trump but let‚Äôs be real) failing.

Iran will not win a war against the US in a stand-up 1v1 fight, however besides the superpowers &amp; proto-superpowers which currently exist, Iran has the most experience and best-trained, best prepared troops and doctrines for fighting a protracted and bloody unconventional and asymmetrical defensive war.  They have extensive in-house weapons production for their locally-designed and sourced weapons and systems.  They have oil, and some amount of nuclear, chemical, and biological capabilities.  They have non-local supporters with extensive training and equipment around the entire region, and some capabilities and support overseas.  They have positive relationships with our two main adversary nations who will provide them as much support as they can get away with, meaning basically unlimited funding and up to and including open military support if we are seen to be losing badly enough (though this is quite unlikely and would not occur until this time next year at the earliest, barring any absolute worst-case scenarios).  This is one of the World War III scenarios.  I see it as unlikely, but at the current time there is no less than a 10% chance it may occur.

Because of the strategic and tactical picture, doctrines which the US has trained in and executed throughout the careers of our entire military personnel body are largely invalid for the prosecution of the combat we are likely to face, and those who trained it it are in their old age.  Even those old hands are only trained in such tactics, pretty much everyone with direct experience is in a nursing home or already dead - and these are folks who fought in Korea and Vietnam.  I do not believe we have anyone left alive who has experience planning and / or commanding an invasion into hostile terrain under contested skies, *and even if we did* the weapons and tactics which were employed during such time were so unlike those which would be employed in this fight as to make that memory entirely unusable.  Keep this in mind when considering all of my ‚Äúnot since...‚Äù proclamations - even though we faced somewhat similar conditions in previous wars, *everything* has changed since then including the attitude we have towards the basic concept of war.  Those comparisons are almost useless, I employ them simply to stress how different this is from the Persian Gulf War, Bosnia, &amp; OEF/OIF.

I‚Äôve been out of the military for nearly 15 years now, but I‚Äôve spent my life - ever since I was a toddler touring battlefields with my dad, all the while talking with his veteran friends - researching and talking about military doctrine, history, and possible future battles.  While I was in the Marines, both during my 1st deployment during OIF I &amp; my 2nd during OIF III, my greatest fear was that we were setting up for an invasion of Iran that I would be a part of, so I have looked into such a possibility extensively.  We were better positioned for such a fight in the mid-2000s, but even then it would have been rough.  We will lose aircraft and aircrews, ships up to a Nimitz-class, and many hundreds if not thousands of troops.  Numbers for the wounded will be extreme.  The occupation will take decades and be more difficult than Iraq &amp; Afghanistan combined, *and we will still need to maintain those occupations* under worse conditions.  

In the worst case, we are forced to fully back Sunni Islam as ‚Äúthe true Islam‚Äù and a large component of Shi‚Äôa Muslims, Sunnis who reject the authority we back, and those who sympathize worldwide turn against us, as our nominal allies persecute and massacre them, leading to a global insurgency which goes on into the foreseeable future, perhaps long after I‚Äôm dead.  Such an outcome would see hundreds of thousands of dead - if not millions - and would become a slow-burn non-nuclear (hopefully) global armed conflict consisting of worldwide invasions and occupations, often against civilian &amp; paramilitary forces employing asymmetrical and sacrifice tactics.  At some point, Russia and / or China will probably get involved.  Whether this is in order to return some semblance of balance to the global strategic picture or because we have decided ‚Äúfuck it, let‚Äôs do this global hegemony thing‚Äù and attempt to subjugate them is an open question and there are far too many variables, and it is much too far into the future, to guess about,  This is another World War III possibility, and I give it no less than a 25% chance of eventually occurring in some form, though some would say it is already happening and I can‚Äôt make a solid case to refute that.  

Percentage estimates for outcomes are rough and should be taken with an ocean of salt.  In fact, take it all with a grain of salt because up to all, or even *none* of this could happen.  Trump is virtually an unknown quantity strategically, and while he faces domestic issues he could see a war with Iran as good for his re-election prospects, and he could be totally right or wildly mistaken about that.  Iran is *also* a wildcard, they‚Äôre not likely to instigate a shooting war because they know that the outcome is the inevitable toppling of their regime, but they have been getting aggressive in Iraq, and working closely with Russia &amp; Syria against ISIS.  The assassination of such an important figure, which could be seen or at least spun as totally unprovoked, may embolden them or cause them to feel forced to retaliate.

The battle between intolerance and ecumenism is as old as time itself, dumb revisionists such as yourself who have never even picked up a book and instead parrot dumb shit only serve to continue this perverted suffering.

&gt;Fair enough let's use a more inclusive phrasing then: any religion that actively proselytizes, especially one that does so by threat, has no fair expectation of a warm welcome. 

who decides what proselytizing is? this is a perfect example because proselytizing was forbidden, and most of the crypto-christians had never even contacted a proper bishop for conversion. Is writing the wrong book and selling your books proselytizing? Is praying the wrong way to a statue that looks too much like the virgin mary an example of your betrayal of your country? A more modern example; Is china's state enforced atheism and the suppression of the uyghurs justified because they are poisonous, unchinese, deleterious, and potentially serve the caliph hidden in the deserts of syria?

fucking disgusting, the shogun didn't kill just missionaries, he killed his countrymen whose only crime was reading something that cannot be unread, and being true to themselves. What warped definition of the public good can excuse this crime?

Was it ok to you when the native americans tried to organize their own system of collective rituals, only to be scattered and slaughtered because of the perceived national security threat of their honest ideology?

At least Chewie goes out a hero, which is more than can be said for a lot of characters, especially when Troy Denning's SW books came out which is just...wtf, man.  

Never read the Dark Nest books (thank god) and started Legacy of the Force...and mentally dropped it the moment it said 'all that non-binary viewpoint of the force is sith propaganda, it's totally dark side'.

Of course you can see the problem.  But prove a significant percent of that have to do with frivolous living, vs someone means being too low to survive.

I peaked nearly $100k in debt.  It was *all* medical and dental bills that I had to put on credit cards before they would do the work.  My wife had cancer... and we needed $50k in dental work between us (while it was our fault not affording and not liking dentists),.

I had a friend living paycheck to paycheck on two full time jobs with ZERO frivolous expenses (unless you count a bottle of Soco every year or so) and they had to go $10k into debt to pay to bury his mother.

You talk like people are hitting $9k by buying trips to Disney World or video games.  I've never seen evidence that's true.  If it were one person in a crowd, you might have an argument, but our entire country is in debt.  And it's not $9000.  The average American holds $38,000 in personal debt.  Most of us haven't spent $38,000 in frivolous expenses in their entire adult lives.

But then I think about what that means for the rest of the world and at the end of the day I always think even with our fuck ups we have good intentions and constantly push progress. 

You are not pushing for any kind of progress in the Middle East. You follow a deeply cynical political game there as anyone else, you are allied with countries that aren't progressive at all (Hello, Saudis), your engagement in Iraq left the country ruined and weak and once you left it was quickly overtaken by ISIS.

In the meantime, the now almost 20 years long war in Afghanistan is going nowhere and you are negotiating with Taliban so that you can withdraw from the mess.

Now for whatever reason, you have decided to turn Iran into enemy number 1 even though the nuclear deal actually had the chance to work. Trump just tore it apart and started this circle of escalation that you are in now and for what exactly? Okay, everyone knows that the Iranian regime consists of a bunch of cunts that uses terror tactics as a way to play the power game against Saudis and their allies in the region - but what the fuck is your end game here, are you going to stop them from doing that by invading them and doing a regime change? You already did that in Iraq, it ended in a disaster.

Are you gonna continue with this maxime pressure campaign? Good luck, Iran has been under American sanctions for decades before they were briefly relieved by Obama, they learnt how to operate under them. Europe is tired if you stirring shit in the Middle East with no end game in sight, because if the many different conflicts go worse there, we will be facing another refugee wave. It won't be you or Israel, it will be Turkey and us. We hoped that the nuclear deal may eventually work to boost the moderates in Iran and help to normalize the behaviour of the regime over time, now the hardliners are stronger than ever.

And btw. I am saying this as someone who supports the presence of US troops in Europe. It is something completely different from your engagament in the Middle East. In Europe, you are actually placed in countries with similar culture, with the approval of the democratically elected governments and you serve here a clear strategic objective of deterring Russia.

In 2011 after the terrorist attacks Congress passed a terrible law, [the AUMF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization_for_Use_of_Military_Force_Against_Terrorists), Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists. It gives the executive, the president, the right to use ""all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on 11 September 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons"". This law has been used for targeted killings all over the world, by both Republican and Democrat presidents. Trump has been playing up the historical links between Iran and al-Qaeda for a long time now, specifically so he [could use the AUMF later on](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/07/aumf-iran-slotkin-pompeo/594454/).

Now, maybe you think this is a stretch. Democrats like Pelosi are claiming it is, but [Obama used the AUMF in extreme ways](http://jackgoldsmith.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Obama-AUMF-Legacy.pdf) and while he said he wanted to repeal it he actually relied on it very heavily.

Legally, the situation is skews more toward Trump. Soleimani was a member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which was declared by the US to be a terrorist organization. He also was one of the leaders of Hezbollah in Lebanon. The administration has been [careful to not say that the AUMF](https://sci-hub.tw/https://doi.org/10.1017/ajil.2019.63) doesn't apply to Iran and the Supreme Court recently agreed that the AUMF continues to be relevant. The EU also considered Soleimani to be a terrorist and have links with other terrorists, indeed he was recently sanctioned for that.

In addition, he was one of the main people helping organize Hezbollah. In that time, Hezbollah carried out terrorist attacks [that killed an American and injured several](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_the_United_States_embassy_in_Baghdad).

So that's the justification: congress gave the president power to prevent another 9/11 and take out the people connected to it, he was a leader in a terrorist organization that had links to the people who carried out 9/11, he was himself identified as a terrorist by multiple countries, and he was involved in attacks against US that killed someone.
