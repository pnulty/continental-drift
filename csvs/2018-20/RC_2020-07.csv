&gt; 3.29 The UK has a long tradition of open capital markets’ policies. As noted in Chapter One,
the UK removed all exchange controls in 1979, a full 15 years before Article 63 TFEU
prohibited restrictions on the Free Movement of Capital and on payments within the EU.
As a result, the impact of the TFEU on the UK’s domestic capital policies has been limited,
and so the development of the Free Movement of Capital largely relates to the opening up
of national markets in other Member States to competition.
&gt; 
&gt; 3.63 Given the global nature of financial markets and the international framework which
&gt; establishes overarching standards for financial services regulation, some stakeholders
&gt; considered how different rules would be in the UK if they were not subject to EU
&gt; legislation.

&gt; 3.64 Stakeholders generally regarded the UK as having strong influence and representation
&gt; at the global-level bodies. For instance, the BBA commented that, ‘The UK... maintains a
&gt; leading voice in [international fora] discussions and it can therefore be argued that the UK
&gt; has materially shaped the parameters of debate before the EU implementation process
&gt; begins and remains well placed to continue to shape EU policy-making’. Evidence from
&gt; Sharon Bowles MEP noted that, ‘International level agreements often suit the UK well due
&gt; to UK engagement at the international level and the fact that international standards setters
&gt; are focussed on larger and systemic financial entities that correlates to the structure of
&gt; much of the UK financial sector’.

&gt; 3.65 On the basis that the global level is responsible for the high-level standards which set
&gt; the direction for and shape of EU legislation and that the UK was considered influential
&gt; at the global level, some stakeholders held the view that UK financial services regulation
&gt; would not necessarily be particularly different from current rules if it was not subject to
&gt; EU legislation. The extent to which UK rules would be expected to diverge from EU rules
&gt; should, however, be considered in light of the extent to which the EU is considered to have
&gt; departed from international standards.

&gt; 3.66 Evidence from Lloyd’s of London noted that, ‘UK prudential insurance regulation would not
&gt; be very different if the UK was solely responsible for the rules’. In the banking sector, the
&gt; BBA and RBS similarly considered that UK regulation would not necessarily be particularly
&gt; different, given the UK’s commitment to global standards. They did, however, highlight
&gt; that if the UK had sole responsibility then implementation of rules may be swifter, as would
&gt; be expected if only one Member State needed to agree the rules compared to 28. This
&gt; could make it easier to undertake equivalence assessments and agree access with other
&gt; non-EU countries as well as reduce the scope for fragmentation and arbitrage.

&gt; 3.67 Others argued that the UK’s ability to take advantage of greater flexibility in considering
&gt; specific national characteristics when applying the rules would create some further
&gt; benefits, especially in more domestic and local markets such as the retail financial services
&gt; sector. The British Private Equity &amp; Venture Capital Association (BVCA) suggested that,
&gt; given sole responsibility, the UK would take forward processes that are more ‘evidence-based and principles focused [...] in contrast to the EU’s “rules-based” approach’.

&gt; 3.68 A number of stakeholders noted that in some cases, and based on past experience, UK
&gt; rules may be tougher than EU regulation. The IRSG referred to the UK’s influence in the
&gt; G20 and suggested that, ‘Undoubtedly, there are some areas of EU rules where the UK
&gt; would have taken a different approach. However, there are many examples where the UK
&gt; would have taken a tougher stance’, noting as an example, the structural banking reforms
&gt; in the Financial Services (Banking Reform ) Act 2013 compared to current European
&gt; proposals.

A concept like Kungfu changed over time and also its understanding differs from people to people. I am not sure when this word invented in Chinese but suppose not far from today. Kungfu, in Chinese it literally means hard training or hard study. For example, 'you can polish a rod to a needle if you kungfu is enough'. It actually means nothin another about combat. The traditional kickboxing named Wushu which technically means 'the knowledge of fighting'. In the ancient world, combat skills were indeed used to fight but not for TV or movie show. So it is real but not fantasy while it was nothing different from the skills which used in Europe. But I do know some fantasy fiction was written hundred or thousand years ago that recorded some kungfu expert who can do something incredible like keep running 400 miles overnight,   too fast to kill a person but not being seen by others, etc. While most people understand these are fantasy but not real. It is said the word Kungfu got popular at the end of 19 century which transferred to the western world by missionaries who learned about some tales and fantasies from some local Chinese person(fantasies are always popular especially from a remote country) then western people started to believe Kungfu is something mysterious and powerful. From the 1960s, movies and TV show became widespread and made up a lot of Kungfu scenes which actually made by filming skills but not fighting skills. People took it in. The word Kungfu was then a terminology of mysterious, ancient Chinese invention that can defeat or kill people in an unbelievable way.

I've purchased 50+ products from Aliexpress but most of them have been under €30 and I would not recommend purchasing expensive products. This is why:

First, there is an 18% tax for products over a certain price. You could ask the seller to write a lower price to avoid taxes but that requires breaking the law and most reputable sellers will probably refuse to do so.

Second, there's the warranty issues. The phone might have warranty but what if it breaks? You'd have to send the phone back to China and most probably have to pay the shipping, then you'd have to wait 4-7 months for it to get back.

There's also the stuff that others have mentioned, the 3+ months wait time due to covid and the components made for asian/global market rather than European one which might cause connectivity problems. 

Also, I want to point out that buying phones from Telekom or A1 is only worth it if you sign a postpaid contract and get a good discount, otherwise they are waaay too overpriced. Your best option is to buy from Ledikom or any other reseller. If you're talking about the Xiaomi Note 10 Lite, it's 24k on Anhoch and Neptun.

[https://www.lightreading.com/cable-video/docsis/cable-upstream-growth-went-bonkers-during-early-stages-of-pandemic-andndash-commscope/d/d-id/759279](https://www.lightreading.com/cable-video/docsis/cable-upstream-growth-went-bonkers-during-early-stages-of-pandemic-andndash-commscope/d/d-id/759279) (""Cable upstream growth went 'bonkers' during early stages of pandemic – CommScope"")

&gt;According to data generated from some of CommScope's cable operator  customers around the globe, upstream usage surged in March when  stay-at-home orders became more prevalent. Specifically, upstream usage  during midday hours grew between 30% for some operators and an  astounding 150% for one European-based operator. Plus, during normal  busy primetime hours, upstream demand climbed 20% to 50%.  
&gt;  
&gt;But rather than peaking at night as in pre-COVID-19 times, the upstream  peak now resembles a long, flat curve, starting at 7 a.m. and running  till midnight, according to CommScope's data. ""The upstream was sorta  going bonkers through the whole day like that,"" Cloonan observed.  
&gt;  
&gt;Downstream usage also climbed during this period, but the overall rise  in peak demands put much more pressure on the available upstream  overhead. That's mostly due to the asymmetric nature of the HFC network,  as much more spectrum is currently dedicated to downstream traffic than  the upstream....  
&gt;  
&gt;Possible moves could include a ""mid-split"" that raises the upstream to  85MHz (up from today's 42MHz on most North American DOCSIS networks) or a  ""high-split"" that lifts the ceiling to 204MHz. In tandem, cable  operators could also beef up the spectrum available for the downstream  by upgrading the netwok to 1.2GHz using today's DOCSIS 3.1  technologies, and use that as a stepping stone toward an expansion to  1.8GHz and DOCSIS 4.0.

So, clearly, downstream capacity may have been adequate, but upstream capacity frequently wasn't.

Google the hell out of things in NY until you find one thing that kind of matches.  Ignore anything that doesn't match at all, and with anything that doesn't really match, just declare that you 'need to use your imagination'.  The farther the stretch, the better.  Preiss wasn't really all that imaginative at all in the solved puzzles, he was actually kind of simple and straightforward and prosaic, so he must have *really* gone off the wall in the other ones.

Google Satellite View is your friend.  Use it to find anything that looks remotely like anything in the paintings.  Use red lines in MS Paint to point out how a street looks exactly like the nose of the woman in the painting.  There is only one street in the world that has a turn that kind of looks like a nose.

Google in general is your friend.  If you find that a house was once owned by a man who, in the 1890s once paid the ship fare of a man to come from Europe to the United States to work in a circus, and the man was a circus freak who was abnormally tall and was older and had grey hair, you've probably found the 'gray giant'.  Don't wonder how anybody would have ever found this in the 1980s without spending years in historical societies and libraries and a hell of a lot of luck.

Use capitalization any way you  like.  If a capitalization meaning a proper noun/name is in the verse and it fits your solve, it's a proper noun.  If the next capitalization doesn't fit your solve, just say Preiss was 'being poetic' and ignore it.

Think in isolation.  Don't look at all the 12 verse/images and think about which ones were already solved and such.  Don't think about how one of them has to be Canada, and there are so few left that could be Canada.  If something 'speaks to you', **it's probably right**, even if you can't justify it all that much.  If you think one of the pairs is assigned incorrectly, and it's actually Rochester, NY or Reno, NV, you *are* most likely correct.  Go with your gut.

Think the only way all 12 haven't been found is because we haven't googled enough.  Ignore the fact that the Chicago casque was only found after Preiss sent the two guys that knew the location a photo of the exact dig location.  Or that the Cleveland casque was narrowed down to a specific planter, and they still had to dig and dig for hours  to find it.  Ignore the fact that burying the casques was kind of a bad idea and even if you know the location it's tough to do.

He shunned reading books and playing board games, opting instead to ride his bike, to swim in the pool, to play football. He dashed everywhere he went, his exhausted parents trailing behind, rather than walk sedately like most boys.

When he was six, his parents let him join the local rugby team, and training tired him out enough to let them take a break, but he still never stood still, until he was eleven and visited his school library.

He pulled a book from the shelf, and was curious. When forced to, he read in a rushed, haphazard manner, but this book intrigued him and so he sat down in one of the hard chairs and read. Engrossed in the book, his world dwindled to that single point, and three hours later he looked up from the final page of the novel to find that it was still 12:28, and the rest of the library was slowly moving back into motion.

Amazed, he pulled another book at random from the shelf, and started reading it. Focused on what was happening around him, and not the book, time moved mostly normally, but the strange spluttering was enough for him to realize what was happening.

Time passed, and the boy slowly gained a stronger understanding of this strange phenomenon, and through meditation and mindfulness gained a level of control over it.

Sitting down for the final exam of High School, to obtain his High School Certificate, he relaxed, and focused entirely on the paper in front of him. Over the course of nine hours, he carefully crafted the perfect essay. Spreading his focus once more, he waited long enough to allay any suspicion and handed is paper in with half an hour to go.

A small part of him felt guilty, that he was cheating, but as a whole he believed that there was nothing wrong with it, that it was a talent that he had nurtured and built on like an intellectual student would nurture and build on their natural intelligence.

Time passed, and first Italy, then Germany and then much of Europe fell under the harsh boot of Fascism. It was a tinderbox once more, and when Fascist and Communist troops moved into Poland, it burst into flame.

Sam was working as a surgeon, and he watched the news roll in as the Phony War turned hot and France fell. He watched the desperate attempts to evacuate the British Expeditionary Forces, and celebrated soberly with the rest of the nation for the Miracle at Dunkirk.

During the massive buildup in the years to follow, he enlisted as a Medic in the British Army, and so found himself three years later on a flimsy landing craft at Juno Beach in Operation Neptune.

Dashing ashore, the red cross blazoned on his helmet scant protection against the mines, artillery and machine gun fire of the German defenders, he flung himself down next to a man shot in the chest, scant moments from death. Forgetting the hail of death and destruction all around Sam focused entirely on the wounded man and time drifted to a stop.

He worked, slowly and methodically, with all the time in the world, and when he resumed time the injuries were patched and the man was stable.

Over the course of the next week, he would save dozens of lives that no other medic could save, before he was himself shot trying yet another mortally wounded soldier. He was rushed back across the Channel, where he recovered in the same hospital he had worked in before the war, and shortly after was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for his actions in Europe.

In years to come, he would think back to the war with regret, wondering how many more young men could have been saved had he not been shot.

Time passed, and he returned to work at the hospital, growing in prominence as one of the worlds top surgeons, and there he met Anne, a 32 year old nurse, and two years later, at the age of 41, he married her. Over the years, he would try to tell her about this strange phenomenon that affected him, but he could never work out how and eventually gave up.

Time passed, and Sam developed cancer of the liver. Despite the best treatment, he steadily declined. On his final day on the earth, his wife sat by his bedside, their grown children surrounding them, and through the pain Sam relaxed. Days past, as he gazed at his loved ones frozen in time, until finally he felt ready. He drew outwards once more, and died with 'I love you' on his lips and a soft smile on his face.

US announced the decision hours after China said it would curb visas to some Americans heading to Hong Kong, itself a tit-for-tat response to a US move.
United States has been leading a global uproar over a national security law approved by China, which Hong Kong activists say would destroy the city's freedoms.
""We can no longer distinguish between the export of controlled items to Hong Kong or to mainland China,"" Pompeo said in a statement. ""We cannot risk these items falling into the hands of the People's Liberation Army, whose primary purpose is to uphold the dictatorship of the CCP by any means necessary,"" he said, referring to the Chinese Communist Party.
The State Department last year approved $2.4 million in defense sales to Hong Kong, of which $1.4 million worth were actually sent, including firearms and ammunition for law enforcement, according to official figures.
The Commerce Department simultaneously said it was revoking its special status for Hong Kong. It will now treat the financial hub the same as China for so-called dual-use exports that have both military and civilian applications -- and which are highly restricted when sought by Beijing.
China promised autonomy for Hong Kong before Britain returned the territory in 1997 but wants no repeat of massive and sometimes destructive protests that rocked the territory last year.
""It gives us no pleasure to take this action, which is a direct consequence of Beijing's decision to violate its own commitments under the UN-registered Sino-British Joint Declaration,"" Pompeo said.
President Donald Trump's administration has already declared that Hong Kong is no longer autonomous in US eyes and has been rolling out a series of measures in response. On Friday, the State Department said it was restricting visas for an unspecified number of Chinese officials seen as responsible for infringing on the autonomy of the Asian financial hub.
In response, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Monday that the US ""scheme... to obstruct the passage of the Hong Kong national security law will never prevail.""
""To target the US's above wrongful actions, China has decided to impose visa restrictions against American individuals who have behaved egregiously on matters concerning Hong Kong,"" Zhao said.
While outlawing acts of subversion, secession, terrorism and colluding with foreign forces, the legislation will allow China's security agencies to set up shop publicly in the city for the first time.
Britain, the European Union and the United Nations rights watchdog have all voiced fears the law could be used to stifle criticism of Beijing, which uses similar laws on the authoritarian mainland to crush dissent.
In Washington, some US lawmakers fear that Trump will take primarily symbolic action on Hong Kong, preferring to prioritize trade concerns that could affect his re-election campaign.
Last week, the US Senate unanimously approved a bill that would impose mandatory economic sanctions against Chinese officials, Hong Kong police -- and banks that work with them -- if they are identified as hurting the city's autonomous status.
Zhao, the foreign ministry spokesman, warned that the US ""should not review, advance or implement relevant negative bills concerning Hong Kong, even less impose so-called sanctions on China, otherwise China will firmly take strong countermeasures.""
Hong Kong was upended by seven straight months of protests last year, initially sparked by an eventually abandoned plan to allow extraditions to the mainland. But they soon morphed into a popular revolt against Beijing's rule and widespread calls for democracy.

I'm going to give you my standard condom advice, but I'm going to preface it with a warning that you're still pretty young — enjoy your life, there's no rush to get laid. But if you do, I want you and your partner to be protected.


Girth (circumference) is the most important factor in choosing a condom. Most condoms are longer than most dicks; if it doesn’t unroll all the way, that’s fine, it’s designed with that in mind. Please note that your girth is not the same measurement as the condom width (condom ""nominal"" width is measured by laying the unrolled condom flat, so instead of the diameter you get one half to the circumference — I don’t know why they do it that way — plus a stretch factor because latex).

First step is to [plug your girth measurement into this handy condom size calculator](https://calcsd.netlify.app/condoms). Please note that your girth is not the same measurement as the condom width (condom ""nominal"" width is measured by laying the unrolled condom flat, so instead of the diameter you get one half to the circumference — I don’t know why they do it that way — plus a stretch factor because latex). 

If you’re uncommonly thick, you should give some consideration to getting some specialty-sized condoms. You can get them from [myONE](https://www.myonecondoms.com/) (USA), [TheyFit](https://www.theyfit.co.uk) (UK + International), or [My.Size](https://www.mysize-condoms.com) (Europe).

It may be very difficult for you to find appropriately sized condoms at your local stores, leaving you with no choice but to order online at a possibly higher cost. That's our cross the bear. I cannot overstate how strongly I discourage using a too-small condom — it’s painful, it wrecks your erection, and you’re at a greatly increased risk of breakage and thus accidental pregnancy or STD transmission. No matter what you’ve been told in sex ed, condoms are **not** one size fits all.

Everyone experiences stuff like this. It is only highlighted as a nation wide tragedy when it happens to black people though. This leads to the perception that they are singled out when that is just not the case. There are vids online that never make mainstream media that will show horrible things that happen to people of all races in america from thugs,bad cops, and just straight up assholes.

 I will tell you right now that I have been harassed and attacked for my race, things that happen to all types of people, because we live in a multi-racial society. No matter what, as long as you live in a mulit-racial society then everyone will at one point will be attacked for their race. It is inevitable. 

The difference from the judgement being put on white people and what I gave to my attackers back then is that  I  thought they were just straight-up assholes. Individuals who act out of order.A positive blame-free judgement I make for Brown/Black people that liberals feel non-white people should always get, but not towards White people.  

 I and others when attacked never thought about what it meant to me or them as a person of European descent, nor did I think about other White people at the time and if they went through the same experiences I have. Now after a few years of liberal aggression I might have to start having such a mindset.

The worldwide number of recorded infections is now just over 10 million from the virus that first emerged in China late last year, with fears growing of a full-blown second wave. The rate of contagion has doubled since May 21.
One million new infections were recorded in just six days, according to AFP news agency, even as some countries loosen punishing lockdowns that have devastated their economies and thrown millions out of work.
United States, the hardest-hit country, has more than 2.5 million cases alone, and efforts to reopen the world's biggest economy have been set back by a jump in new infections in big states such as Florida and California.
President Donald Trump was under growing pressure to set an example by wearing a face mask as his health secretary warned the ""window is closing"" for the country to gain control of the situation.
The disease is also rampaging through Latin America, where Brazil alone has over 1.3 million cases.
Infections are up too in some other parts of the world that have reopened, with Europe registering a caseload of over 2.6 million, although daily rates have stabilised.
The US state of California was the latest authority to reimpose restrictions, ordering bars in Los Angeles and six other counties -- an area with 13.5 million residents -- to close because of the rising number of cases. The hardest-hit parts of the US are in the south and west, where many state leaders had pushed for early economic reopenings.
But Los Angeles, the second-largest US city, only re-opened its bars on June 19. California had already ordered some areas to reinstate stay-at-home orders, while San Francisco announced a ""pause"" in its reopening.
In Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis conceded there had been an ""explosion"" in new cases as the state notched a record 9,585 cases in 24 hours. Miami announced beaches would close over the July 4 holiday weekend and bars are also shutting their doors.
New coronavirus cases have been surging in more than half of US states, reaching record highs.
Several other countries have also imposed new restrictions to counter fresh outbreaks. China imposed a strict lockdown on nearly half a million people in a province surrounding Beijing to contain a fresh cluster.
Beijing official Xu Hejian described the situation as ""severe and complicated"".
Iran, which has struggled to curb its outbreak even as it gradually lifted restrictions from April, said it would make mask-wearing mandatory in certain areas from next week.

&gt; Nsala, the man in the picture, was photographed by English missionary Alice Seeley Harris after he arrived at her mission clutching a parcel that contained what was left of his five-year-old daughter. She'd been killed and dismembered as a punishment when his village failed to meet the rubber quotas demanded by the imperial regime. Harris went on to take hundreds of pictures like this, documenting the violence, enslavement, and exploitation inflicted on the Congolese people by agents of the Belgian King Leopold II, Queen Victoria's cousin. 

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48533964

&gt; The photo was taken in 1904 at a missionary outpost in Baringa, in what was then called the Congo Free State. The man's name was Nsala and his wife and children had just been killed. Alice Seeley Harris's photograph of Nsala, looking at his five-year-old daughter Boali's severed hand and foot caused an uproar back in Europe. The resulting public pressure eventually forced Belgium's King Leopold II - Queen Victoria's cousin - to loosen his grip on the colony famously depicted in the novel Heart of Darkness.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_democracy) talks about this (past experience is that wiki is fairly reliable) and it brings up the third way because of neoliberalism:

"" With the rise in popularity of neoliberalism and the New Right by the 1980s, many social-democratic parties incorporated the Third Way ideology, aiming to fuse economic liberalism with social-democratic welfare policies.\[31\] By the 2010s, social-democratic parties that accepted triangulation and the neoliberal\] shift in policies such as austerity, deregulation, free-trade, privatization and welfare reforms such as workfare experienced a drastic decline\[33\] as the Third Way had largely fallen out of favour in a phenomenon known as Pasokification. ""

Which led me to pasokification:

"" **Pasokification** is the decline of centre-left social-democratic political parties in Europe and several other Western countries during the 2010s and the simultaneous rise of nationalist, left-wing and right-wing populist alternatives""

I think what happened to the Greeks was a result of debts put in place by entities like the IMF and World Bank, so it is incumbent upon me to understand if a social democrat is for globalism or nationalism.  Globalism, is an insidious move toward international authoritarianism.  I'm a nationalist because I see the US constitution (on paper) as antithetical to authoritarianism of any kind. Both Trump and Bill Clinton have shown signs of authoritarian rule.\*  As today some people (like Bill Maher) are worried about Trump not leaving office if he was voted out, I was similarly  worried when Bill Clinton was in office.  He transformed this nation in such a profound way and we are just now starting to feel the effects of that transition.  Putting the USA into the WTO was why an American factory can move to China.  NAFTA only allows a USA company to move to Mexico and Canada.  However the controlled media always talks about NAFTA and almost never mentions the WTO because they want people to forget it is there (they can covertly give it more power when the public's gaze isn't upon it).

[],,RoyalWait,1554077353.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_3inuqn5r,False,False,[],"I kind of reject the premise of this argument. let's break it down bit by bit:

* In the 1700s, Germans in America weren’t considered white.

I don't think the problem was seen as Americans are white and germans are not - which I'm pretty sure we can say is definitively false, because whiteness was a prerequisite for citizenship and I think germans were eligible for citizenship. The problem was that Americans were British and Germans were German. They were basically the first major european, non british, immigrant group to the US.

* Later, Germans were fully accepted as White Americans, and their culture is seen as very American with hotdogs or Christmas trees not being even slightly foreign.

Ignoring the white part, which I already dispelled, Germans were really only seen as full Americans really recently --- up to world war 1 they were still speaking the German language, and during world war 2 they were interned in camps similar to the Japanese. Also, in terms of food, it's important to remember how recent a lot of American cuisine is. The cheeseburger and chocolate chip cookies are both under 100 years old. And although there has been pizza in the US since the early 1900s, it was unknown outside of the Italian community until after world war 2 (there is like a NYT article from the 1940s explaining what pizza is). This isn't unique to the US by the way, a lot of cuisine in general is surprisingly young. As examples, Nachos were invented in the 1940s, and Tiramisu was invented in the 1960s.

&gt; In the end of the 19th century and in the early 20th Century, ethnic groups such as Italians, Irish and Polish weren’t considered White.

Again I dispute this a bit, there definitely were some ideas that they were racially inferior (keep in mind that this was a period where social darwinism was a popular concept, and these countries were basically third world at this time period). However, in terms of segregation, which was extensively legally defined, these people were considered white.

Finally, if we consider latinos as a whole, which I'll basically use the definition of anyone from a Portuguese or Spanish speaking country, then we end up with an extremely racially diverse population. It's hard to tell but mestizos (people of mixed amerindian and european descent) probably only make up 50% of the total population there, and it's far from evenly distributed. Compared to the US, Latin America has more Japanese, more Arabs, more Italians, and almost as much germans (much more if you only count people who speak German). It's not rare at all to be a blond haired, blue eyed latino. I think in the US, nobody would question their whiteness, rather, people would question their latino-ness.

I think the most important factor is that while racism is a similar problem in both Latin America and the US, they way people think about race is not. The George Floyd protests kind of reverberated in Brazil, and one post I saw discussed common arguments used by white people there. It read, ""I can't be racist, my grandfather is black"". and the answer was, ""your grandfather might be black, but you aren't"". In some ways, this is the case here already. Someone like shaun king is frankly not going to be racially profiled in the US. But in the US, in addition to race being something which you are profiled by based on appearance (which basically works the same as in Latin America) it is also an identity which people cling to even if it does not at all match their personal appearance.",True,False,False,,,,0,1593589360,,False,0,{},fwk9zni,False,t3_hir0ua,False,False,t3_hir0ua,/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/hir0ua/do_you_think_that_latinos_will_assimilate_and_be/fwk9zni/,False,,1602187204,13,True,False,PoliticalDiscussion,t5_2sfmf,r/PoliticalDiscussion,public,,0,[],

Basically:

1. Don't rush things. There's no good reason to land colonists as soon as you can. Get your required infrastructure up and running before landing. Make sure you've scanned anough sectors to find a good landing spot: flat, easy access to concrete and rare metals. I don't usually land until 20-30 SOLs have passed. I miss a couple of early achievements, but so what.
2. If founders are getting earthsick it's because they have low comfort and/or sanity. So have an infirmary, have a diner, have some comfortable housing, don't work people on night shifts in your production buildings, but DO in service buildings.
3. You don't need 6 people in a farm to begin with. 2/3 is enough to make sure the crop doesn't fail.
4. You don't need to fully man every building at first, when you don't have enough colonists. Right-click the job slots to enable/disable. If you turn off a whole shift it will save power. Stagger the shifts so power usage is spread out.
5. Have the right people in your first rocket. I've already described this in the stickied thread. Go look. tl;dr Sexy.
6. You're short of money. Loads has been written on this but: a) choose a sponsor that gives you regular income (Europe, USA), b) start mining rare metals ASAP. Just a trickle is fine at first.
7. If you're running out of resources during a disaster then you need more stored (batteries, water towers, O2 tanks). Don't overdo the batteries because they eat polymers. Remember that you can collect surface deposits of metals from all over the map with RC collectors.
8. TAKE IT SLOW! 40-50 buildings is far too many if you can't afford to maintain them. Build just *enough* services, not every service. One ""service slice"" per 50 people consisting of infirmary, diner, grocer is plenty. For many, many SOLs, you can survive in just 1 or 2 domes, mining rare metals for export, building up stockpiles, importing small amounts of electronics &amp; machine parts as required.

&gt;Wie der SZ vorliegende Dokumente nahelegen, fühlt sich der Verfassungsschutz vom Ministerium ausgebremst. Anlass ist die AfD. Meyer-Plath wehrt sich gegen Lösch-Anweisungen seines künftigen Nachfolgers, die einen nachrichtendienstlichen Schaden, einen bundesweiten Ansehensverlust im Verfassungsschutzverbund der Länder sowie „einen politischen Schaden für das Innenministerium und Minister Wöller“ persönlich zur Folge hätten.
&gt;
&gt;Demnach soll das Landesamt Daten von AfD-Abgeordneten löschen, die bisher im Rahmen eines Prüffalls in der Behörde erhoben wurden und zur Einschätzung extremistischer Bestrebungen nötig seien. Referatsleiter Christian argumentiert mit dem besonders geschützten Mandat von Abgeordneten, obwohl es Regeln zur Beobachtung extremistischer Bestrebungen gibt, und, obwohl die Löschanweisung einen empfindlichen Schaden für die bundesweite Sicherheitsarchitektur bedeutet.
&gt;
&gt;„Der Freistaat Sachsen würde öffentlich wahrnehmbar in einem der dynamischsten Felder des modernen Rechtsextremismus, der auch als Nährboden für gewaltbereite Rechtsextremisten von Bedeutung ist, seine Arbeit einstellen“, heißt es in einer Stellungnahme Meyer-Plaths vom Mai an Christian. Werde die Erkenntnislage auf nahe Null reduziert, verliere der sächsische Verfassungsschutz die Bewertungs- und Prognosefähigkeit zur AfD und wegen der Vernetzung auch im gesamten Bereich der „Neuen Rechten“. Einstufungen von Pegida oder der seit einer Woche vom Bundesverfassungsschutz beobachteten Gruppe „Ein Prozent“, die nationalistische und völkische Initiativen verbindet, seien nicht mehr zu bewerkstelligen. Das Landesamt würde in dem Bereich „nicht nur blind, sondern auch sprachlos“. Unter dem Eindruck rechtsextremistischer Anschläge in Kassel, Halle und Hanau sei das untragbar.
&gt;
&gt;Das große Löschen dürfte massive Kapazitäten in Anspruch nehmen. So müssten Gutachten des Bundesamtes für Verfassungsschutz in Gänze gelöscht oder aufwendig geschwärzt werden. Das betreffe über 1.000 Seiten zum „Flügel“, sowie das 443 Seiten starke AfD-Gutachten. Für das Schwärzen von 1.020 betroffenen Dokumenten, so Meyer-Plath, wäre eine Arbeitszeit von 1.500 Stunden nötig. Das Material kann in allen anderen Bundesländern weiter genutzt werden, nur in Sachsen nicht.
&gt;
&gt;Konkret geht es im Streit mit dem Ministerium um mutmaßliche extremistische Aktivitäten von vier Abgeordneten des Sächsischen Landtags, eines EU-Parlamentariers sowie drei Bundestagsabgeordneten, darunter AfD-Bundeschef Tino Chrupalla, deren Daten das Amt löschen soll. Im Unterschied zu Verfassungsschutzbehörden anderer Bundesländer darf in Sachsen wegen der Gesetzeslage die Öffentlichkeit nicht transparent über laufende Prüf- und Verdachtsfälle informiert werden. (...)
&gt;
&gt;Ein neuer Geist sollte [mit Gordian Meyer-Plath] in den Verfassungsschutz einziehen. Mehr Beratung für Kommunalpolitiker und Schulen, weniger Abschottung. Der Verfassungsschutzbericht wurde um Informationen auf Landkreisebene erweitert. Der von vielen geforderte Mentalitätswechsel stieß bald an Grenzen. So schlug der Verfassungsschutz vor, Pegida nach eingehender Prüfung zum Beobachtungsfall zu erklären. Die Fachaufsicht im Innenministerium lehnte ab. Die Anhaltspunkte sollen Referatsleiter Dirk-Martin Christian entgegen der Einschätzung der Fachleute des Landesamtes nicht gereicht haben. (...)
&gt;
&gt;Auch in Sachen AfD beansprucht das Ministerium das letzte Wort – trotz gegenteiliger Einschätzung der Fachleute. Ausländer-, islam und demokratiefeindliche Äußerungen begründeten keine Bestrebungen gegen die Verfassung, schrieb Referatsleiter Christian im Zuge der Auseinandersetzung um die Löschanweisung. Selbst völkisch-nationalistisch geprägte Argumentationsmuster fielen seiner Ansicht nach nur ins Gewicht, wenn belegbar sei, dass der Parlamentarismus des Grundgesetzes durch eine völkische Gesellschaftsordnung ersetzt werden solle. Meinungsäußerungen seien kein Beleg für eine verfassungsfeindliche Zielsetzung, so Christian. Auch die Mitgliedschaft im rechtsextremistischen „Flügel“ der AfD wie im Fall von Landeschef Jörg Urban rechtfertige allenfalls eine vorübergehende Beobachtung.
&gt;
&gt;Verfassungsschutzchef Meyer-Plath widerspricht. Reden und die Teilnahme an entsprechenden Veranstaltungen seien eine Aktivität mit dem Ziel, Mehrheiten für Meinungen zu schaffen, die mit der freiheitlich-demokratischen Grundordnung eben nicht im Einklang stünden. Würden solche Beiträge zur Meinungsbildung nicht berücksichtigt, entfiele der Charakter des Landesamtes als Frühwarnsystem. Als solches scheint Referatsleiter Dirk-Martin Christian den Verfassungsschutz nicht zu betrachten. Als Chef des Landesamtes soll er nun eben jenes „Frühwarnsystem für eine wehrhafte Demokratie“ führen, das umfassende Lagebilder für sämtliche extremistische Bedrohungen brauche. (...)
&gt;
&gt;Meyer-Plath schreibt an seinen künftigen Nachfolger, die Vermerke zu den AfD-Abgeordneten seien nach Anforderungen des Bundesverfassungsgerichts im bundesweiten Verfassungsschutzverbund und nach einem vom Bundesinnenministerium geprüften Handlungsleitfaden erstellt worden. „Ein alleiniges Abweichen Sachsens von dieser Linie wäre mehr als erklärungsbedürftig.“ Sachsen wäre das erste und einzige Bundesland, das mit den Datenlöschungen auch die Bearbeitung der als rechtsextremistische Verdachtsfälle eingestuften Organisationen „Flügel“ und „Junge Alternative“ einstellen müsste. Der Freistaat müsste auch jede Information, die aus dem Bundesamt oder anderen Länderbehörden kommt, sofort löschen. Meyer-Plath zufolge sind alle für die Extremismusaufklärung und -bewertung relevanten Akteure direkt oder indirekt dem Kreis der AfD-Abgeordneten zuzurechnen. (...)
&gt;
&gt;Meyer-Plath war, das zeigt der Schriftwechsel, nicht bereit, die Lösch-Anweisung klaglos hinzunehmen.

Fettgedruckt geht es weiter: „Es wird der Eindruck entstehen, dass das LfV Sachsen und damit auch das Sächsische Staatsministerium des Innern den Kampf des Freistaates gegen Rechtsextremismus – konkret die Auseinandersetzung mit der AfD – nicht, beziehungsweise nur sehr nachlässig wahrnimmt.“ Außerdem müssten das Bundesamt sowie das Bundesinnenministerium informiert werden, dass keine Dokumente mehr entgegen genommen und keine Dokumente mehr ungeschwärzt versandt werden könnten.

Brexit had filled my heart with anxiety and sorrow throughout. Seeing how the media pushed it day after day in the newspapers yet nobody at work would voice or even invite to discuss the subject made me feel left alone.

Only in very small forums you'd get people's opinions on Brexit and to my surprise many of my acquaintances were ok with it. When I told them I was worried they said I'd be fine cause of my other nationality, assuming I had a visa and wasn't there as a EU citizen. My concern wasn't so much about me, I'm just a regular person, with a normal job, not too much to offer. But I do see the world polarising more and more as days go by, like we're driving ourselves into war with one another by just refusing to talk to each other. I spent time talking to open brexiteers about why I thought Brexit was untimely. I don't care if the UK wants to leave the EU. But in the context of a world were being openly stupid, refuse fact checking and where basically the loudest voice is relevant regardless of the substance of their speech, dividing us is not something I'm okay with.

It felt to me like the people I met on a daily basis just let it happen, it felt like if they didn't talk about it, it would go away,  (99% of them, I recall 2 people being openly against it) or maybe they do want Brexit, but they're too worried to assume they're kinda racist, kinda classist kinds of people. Politics turned into drama in the past decade... or sports, we need to learn how to talk to one another again, even if we stand in opposing sides of a subject. That will be the challenge for our echo-chambered trivially obsessed youth. The world in general is racing towards a dark place. And that's terrifying to me, in the same way I just saw the Elephant walk the room and nobody even looking at it.

Then this information could be used to search for them, as this was a registered trait in your documents and in the official records.

Now, while worldwide Jews -- as a religion -- have *very* diverse phenotypes, think e.g. of the black Jews of Ethiopia, within each region/country which is not a typical immigration country (unlike the US or Israel) they were in fact noticably homogenous, exactly because their religion promotes endogamous relationships, ie. marrying outside of the community is frowned upon or even forbidden by religious laws. Even in more open communities which would allow marrying outside of the community (if the groom would convert), in the context of 19th and 20th century Europe this wouldn't noticably dilute the genetics, because such converts were very rare due to widespread antisemitism: even if some Jewish communities would have accepted others, there were no candidates interested in such a course of action.

That means, that in a place with little recent Jewish immigration you indeed had a median Jewish face that was distinct from the median local face.


This chart is not stereotyping for a racist reason. (""I think it's fun to make fun of the traits of others they cannot change. Let's exaggerate it"" -- like in minstrel shows). It is stereotyping for a practical reason. Naturally, being a stereotype it will fail in some concrete instances of its application.

EDIT: because you hanged up on the word ""race"": that word is due to OP. The word ""race"" or equivalent was never used by the people who commissioned the chart or those who drew it. It's OP that used that word in the title. The actual term used in Russian was *nationalnost'*, literally ""nationality"" but the best translation into today's American or British English would be ""ethnicity"", as it did not overlap, was in fact independent of the concept of *grazhdanstvo* ""citizenship"" which was the term used for the *legal relationship* between a state and a person which is captured in the English word ""nationality"" and using that would be thus misleading.

At the same time, your claim ""The whole premise of race is something the nazis propagated through Europe"" is a historically naive statement.

For example, instead of using the term ""police"" they will will ""state security forces.""

Here is a really great portrayal of how American media would write about the current BLM protests if it took place in some other country,

&gt; **Foreign Affairs: Unrest continues for a seventh day in former British colony**

&gt; Unrest and protests continued for a seventh straight day in the former British colony of the United States as the government vowed to use its military to end the demonstrations, US media reported on Tuesday.

&gt; The protests began in the small province of Minnesota, located in the agrarian ‘Middle West,’ over the killing of an ethnic minority by state security forces.

&gt; Protests led by the minority ‘black’ community have erupted throughout the country with the minority group calling for equal rights and better treatment from the government. Protesters have set fire to government installations and looted buildings throughout the country as clashes with security forces continue. The security forces have tried to disperse the protesters with tear gas, rubber bullets and batons but to no avail.

&gt; US President Donald Trump, who was ‘elected’ in 2016 despite the majority of votes going to his rival candidate, vowed in a speech to bring in the military to end the protests.

&gt; “I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,” Trump said in a national address.

&gt; Trump used the opportunity to walk to a religious temple in the national capital Washington DC to proclaim his religious affiliation. Holding a Christian bible in his hand, Trump declared the US “a great nation.”

&gt; **Religious Fundamentalism and persecution of minorities**

&gt; Religious fundamentalism and minority suppression has long been a problem in the former British colony.

&gt; The United States has had a long history of suppressing and persecuting its various ethnic minorities since the country gained its independence from the United Kingdom in 1776.

&gt; The treatment of its indigenous ‘Native Americans,’ its imported Asian and Black communities, and its Hispanic community has long been a source of friction.

&gt; American black minority groups were under a program similar to South Africa’s Apartheid policy until as recently as 1964. Today, the ethnic black community is still detained and killed with impunity by the state security forces and black Americans make up the majority of those incarcerated under the country’s archaic judicial system.

&gt; Religion also plays a major role in governance with religious beliefs separating key state organs including the country’s highest court where many social laws are passed based on the justices personally held religious convictions.

&gt; [Disclaimer: Native Americans is in quotations because it is a blanket term used by the ruling class of the US to call the country’s original inhabitants before the Anglo-European invasion. The ‘Native Americans’ are comprised of thousands of tribes, all with their own culture, language and traditions.]

De NAVO blijft in de voorzienbare toekomst de hoeksteen van het Nederlandse defensiebeleid. Daarnaast wordt er al grootschalig internationaal samengewerkt; de landmacht werkt zeer nauw samen met de Duitsers, de marine met de Belgen etc. De investeringen die nu gedaan worden betreffen puur het herstellen van jarenlange verwaarlozing. 

&gt;Misschien was mijn vraag niet duidelijk, maar: waarom? Wat is er onrealistisch of naief aan? Je ziet nu ook al dat Nederland in NAVO-verband vaak kiest om specifieke taken op zich te nemen en andere taken aan andere landen over te nemen. Waarom zou je dat principe niet breder kunnen toepassen?

In het specifieke voorbeeld dat genoemd wordt: Frankrijk specialiseert zich in luchtverdediging. Dat zou dan betekenen dat Frankrijk een taak toebedeeld krijgt die veel minder risico op personele verliezen met zich meebrengt dan bijvoorbeeld het leveren van infanterietroepen die in direct gevechtscontact staan.

Buiten al deze hypothetische scenario’s wordt ik persoonlijk een beetje moe van de hele EU-leger discussie.

## Area

I am not saying every town should have public transport, that simply is not possible in the US. What I am saying is that there is a lack of it where it is possible. I know that in the pretty large space between metropolitan areas there is't much potential. But the towns *around* metropolitan areas, do have potential.

A lot of people there quite often have to visit the larger metropolitan area for anything from their job to groceries. **This is a potential for public transport.** Instead of taking the car and being stuck in traffic every morning because a lot of people have to get there, if more people took public transport, the traffic would lessen and it would be more beneficial for everyone. The companies behind the public transport could heighten the amount of busses and trains going towards it during the rush hour and the other way in the evening to meet the demand.

Other than that traffic, longer distance trains could travel between the larger cities. On a train people can still work on things on their laptop if they want to and generally it causes less stress than being in the car, possibly stuck in traffic, again. If public transport companies would work with subscriptions to a certain route you travel often that make it cheaper you might even be able to save on the cost in comparison to fuel, maybe they could lower the cost a bit more if it's job traffic and the company you work for has a deal with the train company. They could also advertise it as an easy way to do a city trip without having to worry about parking your car during holidays.

## Government Subsidisation

The US government already has an infrastructure problem that should be solved first. A redistribution of funds to put a bit more emphasis on maintaining the current infrastructure first before building new infrastructure certainly is a hurdle that should be tackled before even trying to do this.

## Everyone owns a car

I don't expect everyone to give up their car. For some things you'll obviously still need your car. Public transport cannot do everything. What it can do is lessen the burden on high traffic routes. They wouldn't be giving up any freedom.

## Efficiency

The main reason it's currently so inefficient is because of the lack of public transport present. If there would be more it would be about as fast. This is simply put a circular argument, if it's not efficient no one will use it, so we won't use public transport, which causes it to be inefficient.

Something else to consider is comfort, if it was slightly slower, but you had to spend less time sitting behind a steering wheel frustrated at traffic, *for some people*, it would be a better option. I'm not saying this would be a valid argument for all people, but there definitely is a market.

## Impossible infrastructure

I live in Belgium, in Flanders more specifically. Belgium is one of the most densely *""infrastructured""* places. It is possible, you just need to actually plan and maintain (admittedly Belgium doesn't do as good a job as it could, but good enough to keep it working). It's not so much that the infrastructure is impossible, it's more the government being unwilling to assign funds to a project like that.

## Uber

The Uber idea certainly is a good temporary solution but it's vastly less efficient than actual public transport. It still has way more cars on the road which causes more traffic, and with that, traffic jams.

## EU vs US

I am well aware you can't just copy the EU system into the US. It would quite frankly be idiotic to think so. This however does not mean that you cannot look at the public transport systems around the world and see what could work in the US.

## More Availability = More Usage

If you need proof that availability of public transport leads to usage, look at all the countries that installed public transport, and look at the usage of the public transport. It does work. All you need is funds to start it, and a bit of advertising of the reasons it is worth using.

After 25 years in Health, have gone from direct patient care to managing statewide projects. Am still ""lucky"" to have gotten the job I did. Funny that. I went to the interviews, achieved what I did, went to more interviews. Worked *harder*.  Seemingly, I should've just rolled dice with the other applicants.

Now, it's, ""Happy to help you with a deposit like we've done with your brothers, but we want you to pay it back with interest"". Hmmm. I've paid off $44K in debt by myself. My wife and I have saved $62K for a home deposit. Over the last five years. We had a trip to Europe for 5 weeks during that period (pre-DR!). And I didn't ask for help.

No. Don't need your money. Thanks for offering, but. No.

I'm not worried about keeping up with the Jones's. I don't know them. They don't know me. I don't care.

Rant. Over.

Your personal finances are exactly that. They are personal.

Family can (and will) snipe from the sidelines. So? It may sting, but bankruptcy and worries will ache you like you have no idea. This is why DR says to be weird.

At my work, many of us are OK during this craziness. But some aren't. It's no joy on my part, but yearly holidays overseas and overspending on home improvements hasn't worked for them in these days.

I wish them well, despite being snickered at for my position on debt. You can only control you. And. Be. Weird. It works!

[],,Cantholdaggro,1465001870.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_yfr0n,False,False,[],"Damn, I mean it’s definitely possible but it will be tough. You’d have to always place at speed 4, always be at war, and always be at 90%+ OE. You’d do this by fighting 3-5 wars at a time. 

Typically I’ll fight 3~ easy wars and fight 1 hard war simultaneously. The purpose of the easy wars are you get you instantly at 90%+ OE so that the months/years I spend at war with the hard nation aren’t wasted.

Sit on nations for years if you have to and just peace them out when they fit into your OE requirements. Also, with big nations that require multiple wars, don’t be obsessed with 100% WS. Click on a province to see how much it’ll cost in WS to take the entire nation and divide that by 100. If they have 340 WS for example, you know you can’t take them out in a single war, or even 3, so don’t aim for that. Instead, aim for 4 80~ WS wars. 80 WS is way easier to get than 99 and subsequent wars will be even easier so you can save the higher WS costing wars for those.

Also, big tip would be to take overseas territory first in peace deals with massive colonial powers. You’ll never go out there to take over territory in war, so it’s better to let them keep their power base in Europe where you can easily siege them down and get a larger amount of WS in subsequent wars because it’s a higher portion of their territory.

Also, for colonial nations, put a stack on a big fleet the enemy won’t fight and bring the fleet to a colonial nation’s capital and take it, then take 5 provinces to core for the CN to spawn once you’ve done it. In subsequent wars you can ask them to cede the land in that colonial region without having to take a fort or even win. 

Speaking of colonial nations, after you make an enemy cede their entire colony to your colony, your colony will have like 400% OE. Keep an army (or in Mexico’s case, 3-4) there to put down rebels. Micromanage then otherwise your CN May implode.

Also, give your colonial nations like 20-30g in subsidies. This will allow them to merc up and stabilize way faster. It’ll also let them be an actual asset in wars sooner. The sooner you get your CN strong enough to beat enemy CN’s the faster your wars with colonial powers will be and the easier, because you won’t have to do anything on the western hermisphere.

Backtracking to your power base, take your low hanging fruit. You can take all of what’s left in Africa in 5~ years which will allow you to move armies out of there and concentrate on your wester and eastern fronts which are the most important. 

You can and should ignore Russia as best you can. Worst case scenario you can truce break with them and take all their land in like 20 years, but your eastern and western fronts are made up of huge composites of different nations. By constantly being at war there, you can make massive gains in a short time because truce timers won’t be a factor.

Lastly, your manpower should never be 0 at this point. In a WC you would’ve wanted Quantity like within first 5 ideas. Be sure to get it now. Also make sure you have humanist, Administrative, and Diplomatic (and quantity). 

Humanist = no rebels = can always be 99% OE
Administrative = CCR
Diplomatic = province WS cost reduction, gives you opportunity to go over 100 OE to 1 shot a nation.
Quantity = infinity manpower.

Generally those 4 along with influence are mandatory for an efficient WC, but by now you’re past the point where influence is going to do much for you, and frankly as the ottoman already have massive CCR bonuses, vassal feeding isn’t super useful.

That being said, i’d really just take this campaign as lessons for future campaigns. Unless you’re experienced. You should know your campaign goals from day 1. The age of discovery is easily the most important age for WC. In the age of discovery, you can neutralize your future end game competition before they’re a threat. For example, you can take the age objective of vassal demand reduction to take Naples and Aragon from Castillo, ensuring they fall off. You can take Norway/Sweden from Denmark to then take novgorod from Novogorod or Muscovy, ensuring that Russia is never formed. You can invade England early through Ireland or directly over the channel and take London and ensure they can never be GB. You can attack Ottoman and take 1 Bulgarian, 1 Byzantine, and 1 Serbian, and 1 Karaman, Serbian, or walloncian province to release them as vassals and then hit the ottomans with a reconquest CB. In 3 50% wars you can kill them. 

You can also plan to min-max more, potentially taking HRE emperorship, or choosing your eary-mid game conflicts better to have a stronger base of power.

For example, your trade income is hurting because you don’t own an end node. If earlier in the campaign you took Venezia, your trade income would be like 20% higher.

Also if you know you’re going to WC, you’ll play more meta orientated and will stick to late game idea groups that I mentioned rather than shit like economic, espionage, early military ideas.",True,False,False,,,,0,1593600659,,False,0,{},fwkl49b,False,t3_hj55mm,False,True,t3_hj55mm,/r/eu4/comments/hj55mm/my_best_run_so_far_but_is_it_still_doable_to_get/fwkl49b/,False,,1602193322,3,True,False,eu4,t5_2uqat,r/eu4,public,,0,[],

*Period competition history including 1929 TT

*No expense-spared maintenance

*In-period competition history

Re-bodied as a saloon whose coachwork was scrapped following a wartime raid, this Boulogne was intended for restoration and after a long time those intentions became reality when it was re-bodied as a Super Sport. An ultra-lightweight body was built by Frazer Nash Car Club captain Bill Roberts and it saw many racing outings before being campaigned by Roberts' son, Steve Stanton: in 1999 it was part of the FNCC's Raid to Bolzano. One year later it was bought by the vendor. The engine was re-built and other mechanicals overhauled, without replacing any original parts. Since then it has taken part in numerous mainland European events including the 2010 Alpenfahrt and Vernasca in 2011 and 2012. Today it is described by the vendor as being in 'top condition', with a 'marvellous patina'.

With much competition history and much expenditure over the years this Boulogne Super Sport is an important part of 'Nash history and should delight any lover of 'true' British sporting cars.

I was warned that reintroducing meat into my diet might be a problem, that my gut would have ""forgotten"" how to digest it after being vegetarian for ten years. But my first steak was actually the best I've ever felt gut-wise after a meal. Go figure!

Are you noticing any problems from grains and dairy specifically? For me, I had felt digestive discomfort (and the post-meal slump) all my life and gotten so used to it, that I didn't notice it was there until it went away and I felt a lot of relief. (There is no slump after eating a steak!) So I would say if you are suspicious, it's certainly worth a try. Only took me a week or two to notice a significant difference in my energy levels and emotional stability.

Have you cut out refined sugar (and ideally. all processed foods) already? For me, that made a huge difference too.

I mean think of it this way. When I ask myself, is this something I'm supposed to be eating, I have to ask.. How many animals breastfeed their entire lives? Using the breast of a different species? Yeah, exactly.

&gt; When you think about it, the purpose of cow's milk is to turn a 65-pound calf into a 400 pound cow as rapidly as possible. Cow's milk is baby calf growth fluid. That's what the stuff is! Everything in that white liquid -- the hormones, the proteins, the lipids, the sodium, the growth factors, the IGF -- every one of those is meant to blow that calf up into a great big cow, or it wouldn't be there.

“the amazon is not the lungs of the world”
- Sure, it’s not a majority oxygen producer for the whole world. But it’s got tens of thousands of species found nowhere else that are losing habitat and going extinct. If the bullet was meant to justify continued deforestation of the amazon, he should remove bullet point 1. This is one way we are extincting species en masse.

But the majority of the world are not taking these measures; if he’s signaling these nations example as a reason there is no crisis, then the wider trajectory of world nations would suggest there is.

“The direct killing of species and habitat loss pose more of a threat to species than climate change”
- in itself, this statement only says that there are bigger threats, not that climate change is not also a serious threat.

&gt; Die USA haben nahezu alle Vorräte des Covid-19-Medikaments Remdesivir aufgekauft. Das berichtet der „Guardian“. Mindestens in den nächsten drei Monaten werde kein anderes Land auf der Welt den Wirkstoff kaufen können.

Das stimmt so einfach nicht. Der [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/30/us-buys-up-world-stock-of-key-covid-19-drug) selbst schreibt ja ganz in den letzten Absätzen etwas kryptisch (das habe ich dann mal gegoogelt):

&gt; Hill said there was a way for the UK to secure supplies of this and other drugs during the pandemic, through what is known as a compulsory licence, which overrides the intellectual property rights of the company. That would allow the UK government to buy from generic companies in Bangladesh or India, where Gilead’s patent is not recognised.

Immerhin hat die [Tagesschau](https://www.tagesschau.de/newsticker/liveblog-coronavirus-mittwoch-119.html) inzwischen bessere Informationen:

&gt; Zwischen den USA und der EU ist ein Streit um das Mittel Remdisivir ausgebrochen. Während das US-Gesundheitsministerium mitteilte, einen Großteil der bis September anvisierten Produktionsmenge des Mittels Remdesivir gesichert zu haben, er wartet das Bundesgesundheitsministerium ""noch in dieser Woche"" die Zulassung des Medikaments Remdesivir für die Behandlung von Covid-19-Patienten in der EU. ""Mit der Zulassung ist die Verpflichtung verbunden, auch in angemessenem Umfang liefern zu können. Wir gehen davon aus, dass Gilead dieser Verpflichtung auch nachkommt"", sagte ein Sprecher des Ministeriums.

The french revolution led to wars as every other country in europe was led by a parasitic aristocratic class who saw that the french were becoming democratic, were rightfully afraid that the people they were oppressing would also, quite rightfully and justly, do away with them, and so the kings &amp; queens and assorted parasites of Europe wanted to strangle democracy in its crib, so the entire rest of europe went to war with France, and France still, sort of, won in the end.

I don't know how education or propaganda went so badly wrong that people are thinking that the french would have been better off if they'd remained serfs. Yeah, *sure* the aristocrats would have just given them all their money in the end anyway. Every right by the common man has been won through force or the threat of force.

&gt;Het voorbeeld toont aan dat met de invulling zoals de AIV die voorstelt bepaalde landen een veel hoger risico op personele verliezen zullen lopen. Bepaalde landen zullen dus onevenredig veel manschappen verliezen in het geval van een conflict, niet wenselijk natuurlijk.

En dat zou nuttig zijn als de wereld morgen vergaat. Als we nu investeren, heeft dat pas resultaat in de toekomst, dus moet je weten wat nodig is voor het uitvoeren van de toekomstige taakinstelling.

Can you get your hands on a whole crab or two for cheap where you are?

So anyway, in a time when I was mostly an atheist, but before I cared about labels or epistemology or really any depth diving of the big questions, I was surrounded by friends who thought very much like me and came to similar conclusions. None of us save one we’re raised religiously. We’d heard some bible stories but never read them ourselves - and we thought they were insane and silly.

So all of a sudden, when reading Chaucer in a grade twelve literature class, when one of my peers got offended by the portrayal of religious leaders, it dawned on me christians were real. I had actually until that point never considered there were still people that believed the bible.

And then shortly thereafter, I discovered I was in fact in the minority - and the vast majority of people in Canada, USA, and Europe are christians.

&gt; But then why its mods literally remove different take on the situation? how is this liberal? they censored people, who didn't defend accused casters, but only questioned some of the accusations and how fast industry decided to cancel their careers.

You have stumbled upon the issue with these two paragraphs without realizing it. You cannot create a community that does not tolerate racism, sexism, fascism, alt-right behavior, and other such behaviors without removing certain takes on situations. To use your DotA 2 example, it would be racist to say ""Russians and Ukranians have cheating in their blood"" in response to the huge amounts of cheating present on Eastern Europe/Russian servers, but it's also a different take on that situation. You cannot simultaneously let me post that *and* be creating an anti-racist community, and banning me for posting it would be totally justified.

Anyway, let's look at your post history on the issue:

* Reddit cancelled X and Y personality, why not Z and Q?
* Video link to ""the privilege game"" as if it's relevant to current events
* An article defending personality R from accusations of misconduct.
* A post claiming girls have privilege in Esports, not removed.
* A removed post that appears to have been a Russian personality basically dismissing certain actions/pressuring people into sex as not bad (also, funnily enough, a *literal Nazi* with 1488 in his username is the most upvoted post explicitly supporting the argument.) Based on the comments, it explicitly said female personalities were lying.
* A post saying that Personality X was always nice to her, implying the accusations against him are false.
* A removed post from a Russian personality that was definitely dismissing certain actions/pressuring people into sex as not bad, and only implicitly argued that the women were lying.

It is *very clear* your intent was to defend certain casters, and that you were repeatedly posting ""different takes"" that were outright attacking the women claiming they were being abused. It is not possible to create a community free of sexism while allowing these sort of things, because by nature many of these takes were promoting the idea that women in general, and especially specific women, make up abuse for attention. Further, the fact that you weren't open about what you were doing, and your comments being extremely combative towards the moderation of the subreddit, make me question your version of events surrounding the action taken against you.

If you truly want a community free of sexism, as you claim, you have to understand that means removing posts and comments that are sexist, promote sexism, or foster support for sexists in the community. Now that you're a few days removed from your ban, you should be able to look back at your posts and realize that *maybe* if you're getting support from Nazis and almost exclusively doubting women in the community, you might have been one of those people promoting and supporting sexism in the community and it was justifiable to remove your posts.",True,False,False,,,,0,1593609058,,False,0,{},fwkvy3c,False,t3_hj9gx6,False,True,t3_hj9gx6,/r/changemyview/comments/hj9gx6/cmv_many_subreddits_here_declare_liberal_values/fwkvy3c/,False,,1602198981,21,True,False,changemyview,t5_2w2s8,r/changemyview,public,,0,[],

Lastly, there are different kinds of racism. There is aversive racism (that is, you avoid interacting with them), cultural racism (you beliefe your culture is superior to other cultures and take measures to demote them) and institutional racism (goverment and law are set up in a way, which disadvantages certain races).


Whereas nobody doubts that many European countries have aversive and cultural racist prople, they tend to be very little institutional racist. That is because many European countries have very strict equality-treatment-laws baked into their constitutions, which stops institutional racism to manifest itself in these countries (or at least those only exist, as long as unnoticed).

In contrary, the US has a big history of institutional racism, up to this day. For example, many US banks still evaluate estate based on the racial make up of the neighborhood. In Europe such practices are forbidden (that is not to say, that they do it silently anyway). A more subtle example: Private banks in the US give student loans based on the parents savings.

CONTROVERSIAL! CONTROVERSIAL! BUY! BUY!""**  I'm pretty sure he's decided that despite all his work over the decades everything is totally fucked, so he might as well cash in and enjoy his last decade or two in luxury.

Most of the article is just auto-fellatio, so let's look at his list of actual points. Many of his bullet-list statements are accurate only under the most rigorously deceptive terms. Others are irrelevant.

&gt;    Humans are not causing a “sixth mass extinction”

True if you mean ""people are not going out to deliberately hunt and kill enough creatures to cause a mass extinction."" Utter bollocks when you factor in habitat erosion, pollution, pesticides, and industrialisation. 

&gt;    The Amazon is not “the lungs of the world”

True -- that's the oceans, but we're acidifying those too, and the Amazon is one of our great reservoirs of biodiversity, as well as a decent indicator of what's going on in less famous natural places.

&gt;    Climate change is not making natural disasters worse

This seems the closest thing to a flat-out lie. I dare say he has some weasel definition of 'climate change' to base it off, but any meteorologist will tell you this is shite. Even I know that high sea surface temps are (a) a thing and (b) add power to hurricanes, and that's the most ""babby's first weather feedback"" thing there is.

&gt;    Fires have declined 25% around the world since 2003

Declined by what metric? By affected area? By affected human population? By number of police incident reports? This is too vague to meaningfully comment on.

&gt;    The amount of land we use for meat — humankind’s biggest use of land — has declined by an area nearly as large as Alaska

Maybe true -- since when though? Also, what about the huge chunks of Amazon razed, used for two years, and then abandoned as new waste/scrubland?

&gt;    The build-up of wood fuel and more houses near forests, not climate change, explain why there are more, and more dangerous, fires in Australia and California

It could certainly be a factor, if it's true, which it may well be. It's vanishingly unlikely to be the ONLY factor.

&gt;    Carbon emissions have been declining in rich nations including Britain, Germany and France since the mid-seventies

Yes, IF you include carbon-offsetting, aka paying other places to plant some trees. Which doesn't help as much as it should. And often isn't even done, a third party somewhere just takes your money and says it'll do it. And even so, SO WHAT? The planet is not just rich north-west Europe. 

&gt;    Adapting to life below sea level made the Netherlands rich not poor

... and? Are we supposed to assume, from that, that Florida will be stronger when the sea is 10m higher? Utterly irrelevant.

&gt;    We produce 25% more food than we need and food surpluses will continue to rise as the world gets hotter

Yes, we do, and corruption and supply-line inefficiency leave billions hungry. And there's no way to know how food surpluses will perform as the climate heats. That part of it is just a wild guess.

&gt;    Habitat loss and the direct killing of wild animals are bigger threats to species than climate change

SO FAR, Chupo. So far. On average. If you ignore polar creatures. Not for much longer, though.

&gt;    Wood fuel is far worse for people and wildlife than fossil fuels

On a Gigawatt by Gigawatt comparison, sure. Much more smoke from wood. I don't remember St. Greta and her little wizards calling on us to convert our trucks and planes to wood-burners.

&gt;    Preventing future pandemics requires more not less “industrial” agriculture

Again, just wild nonsense. There's absolutely no way to know how the industrialisation of agriculture will change future disease development. I _think_ he's saying ""If we pave the Earth then we can't get any pesky bat diseases because they'll all be dead"", but even that is irrelevant.

Anyway, i dont think this statue has, as of now, any particular intrinsic value. It's a hundred years hold, and doesnt look like a breakthrough in artistic technique either. If it does make the majority of belgian peoples uncomfortable, I think it can be removed. If belgians really dont want it anymore, they shouldn't be obliged to keep it, would be absurd. Like saying you have to keep the same tint on the walls of the house you bought. And, I mean, Popes used the colosseum as marble cave. These things, removing or devaluing a monument, or a future piece of art, happened before too. On the other hand I wouldn't like fascist architecture or fasci inscriptions to be removed, or devalued, or vandalized, here in Italy. Because I think they have historic relevance, do not directly offend pretty much anyone, and have often artistic value too. Despite not being belgian myself, I dont think these things apply instead to that particular leopold statue. On the other hand,  it could also serve as a monitus, remembering belgians of the atrocities their country committed, while just removing could simply be a quick way to forget those crimes, rather than an apology, but maybe a celebrative statue like this can hardly be converted to such function.",True,False,False,,,,0,1593610291,,1593610603,0,{},fwkxyah,False,t3_hj3fya,False,False,t1_fwkkhpv,/r/europe/comments/hj3fya/belgium_removes_statue_of_king_responsible_for/fwkxyah/,False,,1602200004,7,True,False,europe,t5_2qh4j,r/europe,public,,0,[],

Background: I have had my business since October 2018. Things have been going very well and I was able to take on an employee to help out in March 2020. Covid hit, and we were actually doing okay for a bit, so I chose not to take out any loans. However, the nature of my business thrives on people going to work or traveling (dog walking biz) and more and more people are either being laid off as opposed to furloughed, as well as cancelling travel far in advance, especially now the EU decided not to allow travelers from America.

I just spoke with my accountant about options, because I am really starting to feel the financial pressure. He suggested the PPP loan, but upon trying to apply I am seeing that I literally just missed the deadline by a day. He mentioned that they extended it by 26 weeks, but I am not seeing that anywhere. To be totally honest I am not the most savvy person with the lingo used on the SBA or gov websites, so I’m trying to figure out what my options are. Anyone hear anything or know better than I?

 Coincidentally or as a consequence, the countries with the highest mortality from COVID-19 are also the countries that have demonized chloroquine the most, i.e. Western Europe and part of the United States. There is therefore a geographical pro- or anti-chloroquine correlation, on the one hand North-South, on the other hand West-East, which is beyond scientific data. A total of 4.6 billions of people live in countries where chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine are recommended for COVID-19.

Kristoff is another rider who has a better chance to win a sprint when it has been a very long and tough race. 200 km is some kind of boundary. Some very good riders are losing a bit of their punch or energy after the 200km mark. And classics riders do better since those races are longer.

I think a results like [this](https://www.procyclingstats.com/race/gent-wevelgem/2019/result) Gent Wevelgem last year is a good example, although arbitrary chosen. A 250 km race with cobbles and hills. 30 man bunch sprint at the end with a huge number of fast men. But the first riders where Kristoff, Degenkolb, Naesen and VDP. 4 classics riders. While the more true sprinters like Viviani and Gaviria got 19th and 21th. Probably not much energy left after 250 km.

And Mathieu imo has enough experience with long races. 300 km for Milan San Remo is long, but it doesn't have that many hills. Amstel is 265 km with many many hills, he did well too in Flanders and GW, which are both around the same length as Amstel. Even in Dwars door Vlaanderen (and Brabantse Pijl too) I felt like he had plenty of energy left after 200 km by stomping fast man like Alaphilippe and Matthews. They didn't have a chance.

During the Middle Ages, Jewish people under Muslim rule experienced tolerance and integration. Some historians refer to this time period as the ""Golden Age"" for the Jews, as more opportunities became available to them. In the context of day-to-day life, Abdel Fattah Ashour, a professor of medieval history at Cairo University, states that Jewish people found solace under Islamic rule during the Middle Ages.The Muslim rule at times didn't fully enforce the Pact of Umar and the traditional Dhimmi status of Jews; i.e., the Jews sometimes, as in eleventh-century Granada, were not second-class citizens. Author Merlin Swartz referred to this time period as a new era for the Jews, stating that the attitude of tolerance led to Jewish integration into Arab-Islamic society.

Social integration allowed Jews to make great advances in new fields, including mathematics, astronomy, philosophy, chemistry and philology, with some even gaining political power under Islamic rule. For example, the vizier of Baghdad entrusted his capital to Jewish bankers, Jews were put in charge of certain parts of maritime and slave trade, and Siraf, the principal port of the caliphate in the 10th century, had a Jewish governor. Increased commercial freedom increased their integration into the Arab marketplace. 

Leon Poliakov writes that in the early ages of Islam, Jews enjoyed great privileges, and their communities prospered. No laws or social barriers restricted their commercial activities, and exclusive trade and craft guilds like those in Europe did not exist. Jews who moved to Muslim lands found themselves free to engage in any profession, resulting in less stigma than in Europe where such restrictions were still in force.",True,False,False,,,,0,1593611729,,False,0,{},fwl0e5p,False,t3_hj7pfr,False,False,t1_fwkzj8r,/r/anime_titties/comments/hj7pfr/italy_seizes_world_record_14tonne_of_isismade/fwl0e5p/,False,,1602201236,44,True,False,anime_titties,t5_2n4vyh,r/anime_titties,public,,0,[],

“I don’t view humanity as a single species...”  
  
“The whole breeding arena of the species needs to be cleaned the fuck up!”  
  
""Screaming 'racism' at people because blacks are collectively less intelligent...is insane.""  
  
“You cannot run a high IQ [white] society with low IQ [non-white] people…these [non-white] immigrants are going to fail...and they're not just going to fail a little, they are going to fail hard…they're not staying on welfare because they’re lazy...they’re doing what is economically the best option for them...you are importing a gene set that is incompatible with success in a free-market economy.”   
Note: for this one the things in brackets were added for context. It's from a video about how non-white immigrants going to Europe will destroy European society, so the implications are pretty clear in context.  
  
“...the Germans were in danger of being taken over by what they perceived as Jewish-led Communism. And Jewish-led Communism had wiped out tens of millions of white Christians in Russia and they were afraid of the same thing. And there was this wild overreaction and all this kind of stuff.”  
Note: this is him ""describing"" (read: intentionally down-playing) the Holocaust  
  
“One of the biggest questions in America is ethnic crime rates...and y’know the [Asians] are the model minority…[while] the American blacks and blacks around the world have truly shockingly high levels of criminality and the general explanation is y’know slavery plus racism plus poverty, whatever it is which creates this unholy brew...but as far as I understand it there are significant contributions that your field can make to help people untangle [why] there are such differences in ethnic positive and negative behaviours in society...American blacks have roughly a standard IQ below whites... ”  
  
“If we could just get people to be nice to their babies for five years straight, that would be it for war, drug abuse, addiction, promiscuity, sexually transmitted diseases. Almost all would be completely eliminated, because they all arise from dysfunctional early childhood experiences, which are all run by women.”

 O gabinete de curiosidades e aberrações que se constituiu em torno do presidente é sinal de seu isolamento político. Bolsonaro simplesmente não parece ter ideia de onde se virar.

Lembro o que foi o ocaso do governo Collor. A abertura do processo de impeachment seria aprovada pela Câmara em setembro de 1992.

 Em plena desmoralização, Collor contava com ministros altamente respeitados.

 O célebre Adib Jatene foi nomeado para a Saúde em fevereiro daquele ano. Em março, entrava na Justiça um histórico jurisconsulto, Célio Borja. Considerado gênio em matéria de infraestrutura, Eliezer Batista foi para os Assuntos Estratégicos. Um intelectual de altíssimo nível, Hélio Jaguaribe, ocupou a Ciência e Tecnologia.

  O sempre admirado Fernando Henrique Cardoso só não entrou para as Relações Exteriores porque, numa reunião na cúpula do PSDB, Mário Covas fechou o tempo.

 Xingador, descontrolado, [adepto do jet-ski ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/painel/2020/05/apos-passeio-de-jet-ski-collor-avisa-bolsonaro-nas-redes-se-continuar-assim-vai-afundar.shtml)e com uma enfática agenda neoliberal, Collor ainda assim mantinha algumas alianças à esquerda.

 Em julho de 1992, Leonel Brizola participou de um comício com ele. Não sem malevolência, o livro “Collor Presidente”, de Marco Antonio Villa, recorda que Ruth Escobar, grande personalidade do teatro e da luta contra a ditadura, detinha um posto de adida cultural nos Estados Unidos.

Cavalheiros de fino trato e alta erudição, como Celso Lafer (Ministério das Relações Exteriores) entraram para o governo Collor em abril, seis meses antes do impeachment.

 Nomeado para a Cultura em 1991, Sérgio Paulo Rouanet —autor de ótimos livros sobre Walter Benjamin e Freud— ficaria com Fernando Collor até o seu amargo fim.

 Agora, nem Alexandre Frota apoia o presidente Bolsonaro. Até Olavo de Carvalho reclama.

 Os movimentos virtuais contra o governo vão de Alckmin a Boulos, dos que derrubaram Dilma aos que a apoiarão sempre. Na onda oposicionista, muitos se dão ao luxo de vetar adesões: “Sarney, Sergio Moro, Janaina Paschoal? Com esses eu não faço aliança”.

 O último vínculo de Bolsonaro com as “elites” fica sendo, assim, o economista Paulo Guedes

 Vejo-o sem máscara, o pobre, numa recente palhaçada presidencial. Ao fundo, o presidente da Embratur entoava a [“Ave Maria” na sanfona](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/joaopereiracoutinho/2020/06/sanfoneiro-de-bolsonaro-vandalizou-ave-maria-com-talento-de-um-iconoclasta.shtml), em homenagem aos mortos do coronavírus.

 Guedes parece ser convocado nos momentos solenes (como o da foto oficial pela saída de Moro) e costuma tomar cuidado com a contaminação.

 Pela cara, ou melhor, pela ausência de cara que demonstrou durante a récita religiosa, Guedes já parecia estar sob os efeitos da cloroquina; ou então aprendeu com Nelson Teich o uso tático da “facies cadaverica” nos momentos de estresse.

 Como ele aguenta? Um economista acostumado a ler (ainda por cima em inglês)... Um homem fino, à vontade nos salões do George V e do Crillon, capaz sem dúvida de distinguir um Château Margaux de um Saint-Émilion Cheval Blanc! 

 Ei-lo no mundo do guaraná Dolly, da sanfonada, do torresminho. Nem no governo Lula se viu uma coisa dessas. Triste situação para qualquer representante do “mercado”. Adaptando uma frase conhecida, é o caso de dizer que Delfim Netto, se estivesse morto, estaria se revirando na tumba.

 Claro que Paulo Guedes, a exemplo de tantos gênios das finanças, não tem problema com ditadores e generais.

 Mas pelo menos, quando trabalhou no [Chile de Pinochet](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2018/10/exemplo-de-guedes-chile-tem-contrarreforma-da-previdencia.shtml), havia alguns vinhos medianos e boas estações de esqui.

 É o que se chamaria de um retrocesso.

 Com Bolsonaro se sustentando graças ao auxílio mensal de R$ 600, Paulo Guedes se põe numa espécie de quarentena. Sua cloroquina é a crença de que, com novas reformas, e com a retomada de cortes e privatizações, haverá de voltar “a confiança do investidor”.

 Eis uma fórmula mágica que já deveria ter sido abandonada há muito tempo. Que confiança pode ter alguém —a menos que seja algum aventureiro da especulação— num país dominado por malucos, pistoleiros e destruidores do meio ambiente?

And to think all religions start from worshipping the sun. 


. This is the sun. As far back as 10,000 B.C., history is abundant with carvings and writings reflecting people’s respect and adoration for this object.
Numerous artifacts prove these points, such as from the sun-worshipping cultures of the Egyptians, Indians, Babylonians and Greeks, among many others, including the peoples of the Levant and ancient Israel. Concerning the antiquity of sun worship, UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador Dr. Madanjeet Singh relates:
The tool-making hominids, as anthropologists call them, emerged about one-and-a-half million
years ago. But the sun‘s identification with the animals they hunted became evident much later as
in the striking circular engravings representing the sun, discovered in the Central Asian regions
(thirteenth millennium BC) in Siberia and western Turkistan. They seem to have eventually
influenced the earliest artifacts made in Iran and Mesopotamia... Apart from the animals depicted
in the Lascaux caves in France, at Altamira in Spain, at Adduara in Sicily (15,000 to 10,000 BC),
and at the prehistoric Tassili N‘Ajjer in the Sahara region (7000 to 4000 BC), are also strange
human figures such as the dancing man with horns on his head and a stallion tail, as in the cave
paintings at Trois Frères in Ariège. These are comparable to similar figures seen on the third-
millennium-BC Mohenjo-daro seals found in the Indus Valley—symbols that are identified with the

This solar religion continued for millennia, well into the common or ―Christian‖ era. As stated by Dr. Lee I.A. Levine, a professor at the Jewish Theological Seminary:
On the religious plane, belief in the supremacy of the sun god was widespread. The cult of Mithra, as well as other Oriental cults in the late Roman era, identified the supreme deity with the sun. In fact, the tendency in Late Antiquity to unify the creeds allowed [the Greek sun god] Helios to be identified in many circles as the highest deity. On an intellectual level, Neoplatonic thought throughout these centuries likewise addressed the centrality of the sun... Closer to Palestine, sun- worship is amply attested...in Palmyra, among the Essenes, in Nabataea, as well as on a plethora

In the late Roman era, the figure of Helios, or Sol Invictus, occupied a central role in a variety of settings, from the Imperial circles of Rome to the eastern provinces... Throughout the Greco- Roman period generally, and especially in the first centuries of the Common Era, the cult of this

Sun worship persists to this day, as described in Dr. Singh‘s The Sun: Symbol of Power and Life, an extensive survey with many images of solar religious traditions and iconography from the earliest periods into the modern era.

&gt; If there is no trade deal there will be a border or you could just transport forbidden goods.

Even if there is a trade deal, there needs to be a border because regulatory and customs checks happen regardless of trade deals. To remove the border, you would need a customs union and full regulatory alignment (essentially, staying in the EU customs union and the single market). The UK has made it very clear that it doesn't want that (but has long retained a rather cavalier attitude about the consequences of that decision).

Due to the WA, the border will be implemented in the Irish sea (or rather the UK ports on the UK side of it) and Northern Ireland will, for all intends and purposes, remain in the single market with a few special provisions for goods meant for local consumption.

My only point is that ""no deal"" used to mean ""no withdrawal agreement"" (which implies no trade deal because the EU would never sign one without agreement on outstanding issues) and what is currently meant by ""no deal"" is ""no trade deal"".

We (the US and Europe over the course of 200yrs) knowingly and intentionally created, funded and protected Wahhabism (the satanic offshoot of Islam that has given birth to groups like Hamas, ISIS, Al Queda and almost all the others). 

We knowingly and intentionally instigated and funded sectarian conflicts and tribal conflicts and successfully got the whole region to be at each other’s throats THEEEEN we turn around and say: “oh they’ve always been like this there’s no hope for them” like WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK... not only does it dehumanize Arabs and vilify Islam but it is also factually incorrect and that’s the most frustrating part of it.

Solang du nicht in Geld schwimmst oder professionell Sport auf deinem Fahrrad machen willst, ist ein gebrauchtes immer die richtige Entscheidung, würd ich sagen.

[https://www.bergfreunde.eu/bike-frame-size-calculator/](https://www.bergfreunde.eu/bike-frame-size-calculator/) da kannst du deine Schritthöhe eingeben und kriegst eine daumenmalpi Vermutung, was eine gute Rahmengröße für dich ist. (zum Stadtradfahren völlig ausreichend)

Vielleicht bist du schonmal Citybike gefahren, dann weißt du, dass die 3-Gänge haben, was völlig ausreichend ist fürs Stadtrad. (gibt auch singlespeeds/fixies, die mit sog. ""magic gear"" ein gutes Übersetzungsverhältnis haben, d.h. Steigungen sind möglich und auf der Ebene kann man noch halbwegs schnell fahren). Vorteil von weniger Gängen ist Gewichtersparnis - ein klassischer, älterer MTB-Antrieb mit 3 Ringen vorne und 7 hinten wär ziemlich übertrieben, ist aber im Grunde überhaupt kein Problem und Geschmackssache.

Am allerwichtigsten ist bei der Inspektion, dass du den Rahmen auf Risse/Beschädigungen/Rost kontrollierst (vorallem die unterseite der Rohre, die zur Straße schauen wegen Steinschlag). Dann schau, dass der Sattel nicht feststeckt, die Felgen nicht eiern. Wenn du dir ein Rad mit Felgenbremsen kaufst (definitiv zu empfehlen), kannst du entlang der Felge, wo der Bremsbelag die Felge berührt, mit dem Finger entlangfahren. Je eingekerbter, u-förmiger das ist, desto abgenutzter ist die Felge. Abnutzung der Zahnräder des Antriebs kannst du neben Betrachtung der einzelnen Zähne und ihrer Abnutzung (Achtung, sind meistens dreckig und schaun schlimmer aus, als es ist, du suchst nach Materialverformung/starker Materialabrieb) so feststellen, dass du die Kette beim vorderen, großen Ring vom Ring wegziehst und schaust, wie weit du sie ziehen kannst. (Ketten leiern sich mit der Zeit immer mehr aus, und ab einer gewissen Länge ist das schlecht für die Zahnräder, wenn man dann lange damit fährt, nutzen die sich ab und dann ist ein ziemlich teurer Komponent des Fahrrads reif für den Müll.) Schau, ob Umwerfer (falls vorhanden, das Ding das vorne die Kette auf ein anderes Kettenblatt umwirft) und Schaltwerk (das Ding hinten, dass dasselbe macht) nicht kaputt, verbogen sind, wenns nicht komplett einwandfrei schaltet, kann das auch an schlechter Einstellung liegen, muss nicht zwingend bedeuten, dass die kaputt sind. (aber je mehr funktioniert von vornherein, desto besser)

Der Rest kann relativ zu diesen primären Punkten kostengünstig neu eingestellt und erneuert werden (z.B. Schaltungeinstellen, Reifen, Bremsen/Bremsbeläge, Bremskabeln)

Ich würd dir für die Stadt einen Rennrad - Stahlrahmen empfehlen, bissi schwerer als Aluminium, fährt sich aber angenehmer, außer du findest so ein neueres Trekkingrad mit Federgabel (die Dämpfer vorne) und dir taugt sowas (wiegt mehr als starre Gabel). Kommt auch drauf an, ob du vllt irgendwann einen Gepäckträger montieren willst, das geht auf älteren Rennrädern eher schwerer. Mein Herumgurker, Arbeitsstute und Vorstellung von Idealfahrrad ist ein 26inch Stahlrahmen MTB mit starrer Gabel, Flatbar und dünneren Slickreifen, leider noch mit 3x vorne, aber das wird hoffentlich bald geändert. :3

Und zu guter Letzt, aber eigentlich am wichtigsten, ist, dass du drauf fährst und schaust, ob dir das Gefühl auf dem Fahrrad taugt. :)

Bin ein extremst schlechter Fahrradmechaniker, also hoffentlich melden sich noch Leute, die dir genauer erklären können wie man z.B. Abnutzung vom Antrieb feststellt usw.

Full disclosure, I do not or never have worked for IKEA but I have studied their supply chain and set-up a while ago (some of this may not be up-to-date). This may or may not ease your frustration…I am not defending IKEA by any means, just trying to shed some light on the situation.   
 

It can be suggested that IKEA has been late to the e-commerce game and this was admitted by a former CEO Peter Angefjäll in an annual report so it's been a game of catch-up to change a well-oiled flat pack empire, with the emphasis on you the customer doing the last mile.  
 

There are two major types of distribution flow that IKEA has created for itself. Direct delivery from the supplier to the store(s) or from a supplier to a DC and then to a store - what product goes in what flow depends on what it is.   
 

If it's something that has a high turnover then it will mostly likely be sent directly to the store (this is where the driver shortage and supply chain disruptions come in, most famously pre-corona it was the port problems on the East and West Coast of the US. A container would come in and then be stuck in a queue until a truck could come and pick it up and deliver it to the store.   
 

If it's low turnover it will sit in a DC and be sent to a store when needed, typically kitchens, appliances. Now, the stores themselves work on JIT with little actual warehouse space of their own. Where you pick up the furniture as a customer is effectively the warehouse. They are also optimised to hold a certain amount of articles…I think it’s 9000 permanent ones (as in SKUs and then there’s local variations so it pushes it up to about 12 000). In theory, high, predictable volumes mean that with planning, a solid supplier base you could have a store refilled from the supplier the night before. 

So in order to make something of the shift to e-commerce the self-serve area in the store where you pick up items is also the same stock that gets sent out to you as a customer if you order online. Then you could argue that if the store is closed and no-one is visiting then the store just becomes a DC. In the US this may not be so easy because as you’re aware the ratio of stores close enough to people is actually quite low compared to Europe, I have read that some people need to travel 4 hours one way to get to their nearest store. However, LOTS more people have the internet and the geographical reach is thus greater…so, yep order shock etc. Combined with this, the market hall in a store with all your bedding, cookware etc is ALSO part of the e-commerce stock so you’re actually taking stock from the shop floor and sending it out. 

Also, the DCs themselves aren’t designed to send stock directly to a customer (sounds a bit odd because a DC can be changed to however you want in theory). In order to try and solve this is the creation of e-commerce DCs with a more diverse range of items, smaller ones etc but these are few and far between, the only one I’m aware of is in place called Torsvik in Sweden. Ingvar famously said that to keep costs low every part of the container should be filled so you don’t transport air. But if you order 16 mugs, a few towels, a sofa and some plants then you have a lot of air and packaging that works in a store layout and to be carried home by you and not via a box in a FedEx truck. 

The store itself is an old concept and will become even more so in the future. You will probably seem them becoming mini DCs in order to make up for the fact that people just won’t want to pay a visit. 

So in short, IKEA is still not as nimble as the likes of Amazon or other retailers because the logistics is optimised still for the store.",True,False,False,,,,0,1593616021,,False,0,{},fwl8gc3,False,t3_hioh85,False,False,t3_hioh85,/r/IKEA/comments/hioh85/whats_really_going_on_with_ikeas_online/fwl8gc3/,False,,1602205416,6,True,False,IKEA,t5_2s9a5,r/IKEA,public,,0,[],

&gt; Segundo a ministra de Estado e da Presidência, Mariana Vieira da Silva, o objetivo é perceber aspetos como a forma de propagação deste discurso nas plataformas ‘online’, **as mensagens que contém, identificar autores**, monitorizar processos de queixas, entre outros aspetos.

&gt; O Governo foi ainda questionado sobre o inquérito à origem etnicorracial dos portugueses que o Instituto Nacional de Estatística (INE) pretende desenvolver, um tema polémico depois de ter sido recusada a inclusão de uma pergunta nesse sentido nos censos de 2021, **tendo a ministra referido que o INE está agora a trabalhar na identificação dos recursos necessários para que o inquérito possa avançar em 2021 ou 2022**.

A comunidade cigana não vai ficar contente com este ultimo, tendo em conta que foi pelo seu representante que a ideia de aplicar isto nos Census não foi aplicada, tendo até levado a SOS Racismo, que era a favor, a ser afectada pela decisão.

Quanto ao resto, só posso esperar para ver como é que isto será aplicado mas tenho questões sobre o que é que **um governo** vai considerar como discurso de ódio. Porque seguindo certas [**coisas**](https://old.reddit.com/r/portugal/comments/hgqqo9/european_social_survey_62_dos_portugueses/fw5p9pm/), vai ser interessante ver que medidas de controlo e censura podem resultar daqui. Porque vão resultar, isso nem é exactamente uma questão, só depende da interpretação que **o governo** irá ter. Se for a mesma linha da União Europeia, será interessante.

Por mera curiosidade, o que é que a malta de esquerda pensa disto? Eu sei que alguns já batem palminhas quanto a controlar e perseguir fachos, tudo certo com isso porque é o esperado. Mas, com 3 passos atrás e a ver a pintura geral, o que pensam desta ferramenta de identificação de conteúdo nas mãos de um Estado? E digo Estado porque o PS não vai governar para sempre.

Quer dizer, o tal inquérito étnico não passa porque uma comunidade das minorias tem preocupações sobre como esses dados podem ser usados nas mãos de um governo de Direita, segundo as fontes naquela altura. Mas esta ferramenta que irá englobar conteúdo de toda a gente, online, já não preocupa? Espero que preocupe.

I think it’s because people at one point were trying to use it to make dawah, but didn’t think twice about the implications. Frankly, I think that is the unfortunate consequence of many da’ees not having a thorough enough background in the sciences. Thus, many jumped to using science to appeal to some modern day folk. However, now they’re perhaps recognizing it may not be the best approach? 

Using science to confirm the Qur’an is the same as using a manmade and inherently prone-to-error method to prove a text that is from God and is perfect. Yes, it is our belief that it is from God and that it is perfect. However, when we do choose to believe in the Qur’an, it should be based on what the Qur’an says, not on what man says about what’s in the Qur’an. That’s common sense. Before major scientific discoveries of the modern world, people still believed in the Qur’an. They didn’t need to know all the modern day ideas expressed by the scientific community. 

If you study the history of science in Islam, you’ll notice that Muslim thinkers, scholars, and scientists always used the Qur’an to understand reality and the world, and didn’t try to use their observation of the world to dictate their belief in the Qur’an. Yet, they were often hundred of years ahead of their European inheritors. Read books like “Islamic Science and the Making of the European Renaissance” by George Saliba. You’ll see that modern day scientific thinking owes much of itself to Islamic thinkers.

This is not to vilify science or suggest that it is not good. In fact, science is neither morally good nor bad, it is merely a methodology. This methodology isn’t a set of laws of the world, it serves to help humans understand laws of the world. It doesn’t help us understand those laws perfectly always. Sometimes we are fortunate enough to find some laws in nature that are consistent. However, we always continue to discover that our previous assumptions about the world aren’t exactly correct. Thus, science as a field is under constant modification. Should we use a constantly modifying chain of thought to judge the validity of book from God? No. We can use it to help increase us in faith, but not make it the foundation of our faith. 

You can see that what the Qur’an says about the universe and other facts of nature are correct, but sometimes scientists come up with alternate ideas that they think are correct. Take the evolution of man for example. The Qur’an and evolutionary science as a field are in disagreement over how modern humans came to be. Thus, if one is to say “science can be found in the Qur’an always and that’s why I believe in it”, they’d be lying. Much of modern science agrees with the Qur’an, but not all of it.

Science is not law- it helps us discover laws. However, since it is developed entirely by our flawed, inconsistent, and severely limited abilities of observation, it is many times flawed, inconsistent, and severely limited. What we know about reality is less than a drop, and what we don’t know is more vast than all the oceans on the earth. You can’t use such limited assumptions about reality, no matter how many times you validate it, as a foundation of your faith. It should rather be used a confirmation of your faith. Whatever “science” you want to use to believe in the Qur’an should be understood in the way the Qur’an wants you to understand it. Meaning, if we take the idea that the universe is expanding, which is referenced in the Qur’an according to some or many interpretations, then we should believe that it is. We can then look at the concept of universe’s expansion discovered by Hubble and say “the Qur’an agrees with this according to my observation, so it must be correct.” In this case, the Qur’an confirms your reality first, and then reality in turns agrees with what you read in the Qur’an. Thus, the science could have helped you increase in faith, not made you develop faith from scratch. Now, when we look at the idea of the evolution of man from lesser apes according to science, and we see that the Qur’an disagrees- we shouldn’t try to mold what the Qur’an says to fit science. Instead, we confirm our disagreement with the idea of evolution of man from lesser ape, and agree with the Qur’an. We don’t suddenly disbelieve in the Qur’an. We confirm that God knows best and that man’s knowledge on the origin of man is incomplete. 

God always tells us to observe the universe around us as having proofs for His existence and power. We should do that as God wants us to, but not be so arrogant to assume that we know what’s best about the universe.

But to offer a perspective.  I think these thing operate on a spectrum and not a binary.  I think its easier to justify a right of return for people who often had a living relative who lived in Palestine, or have photos and other memorbilia including property deeds,  and who currently live in refugee camps as a direct result of the displacement.

Its harder for a group of Europeans who had no real material connection to the area outside of religious text for two millenia.

Racism and sexism exist in every sector. They manifest differently in tech than on other sectors, but are hardly unique to tech. 

As for overworking, I hear this a lot, and i know some places like EA are famous for abusing it, but at the places I’ve worked, it’s more individuals choosing to work more hours than any insititutional demand for it. I think a big part of it is the reality that some people can do more in 10 hours than other people can do in 50. Those rare, highly efficient people don’t need to work insane hours (though some still do), but the less efficient/productive ones might feel a need to work insane hours to feel like they’re meeting expectations.

This organization also conveniently sidesteps the fact that honey bees are direct competitors of native bees and are in fact one of the pressures threatening them.

People have to eat, but that doesn’t mean agriculture is conservation. No one would think that donating to corn and soybean production saves endangered plants.

A single heavy tank (or tank destroyer since it is cheaper) contributes to armor (formula is 30% or 40% of the highest unit plus 70% to 60% of the average) Inability to pierce the target means the target does 50% more org damage and takes 50% less.

Om te antwoorden op:

&gt;Ik denk dat als je de resultaten net buiten de multiculturele steden bekijkt, dat je het antwoord krijgt.

De regio Leuven en Mechelen en omliggende gemeentes hebben ongeveer een gelijkende trend, nl vooral liberaal en socialistisch met een beetje Groen. Al valt het op dat in de landelijke dorpen (e.g. Haacht, of Kampenhout) NVA en CDV een beetje hogere percentages neertellen, maar ik denk niet dat dit ook maar enig statistisch bewijs is. Vooral aangezien dorpen sowieso al vaker centrum of centrum rechts stemmen tegenover steden. Dit was ook al zo voor migrantenstemrecht.

Dus zeggen dat migranten (niet-EU) een grote bijdrage leveren aan bepaalde partijen grenst mijns inziens aan het statistisch onwaarschijnlijke. aka. mochten migranten niet meestemmen zou de percentages voor centrum-rechts een beetje hoger zijn, maar extreem breed zou het verschil waarschijnlijk niet zijn.

Yes, both are interested in not being a part of the EU. However, I find that for Swiss this is often stated in terms of a desire to keep the representational democracy, monetary independence (stability .. banking .. a few themes there), and similar themes. It's more of a ""things aren't broken, let's not fix them"" sort of mindset, coupled with a difference of opinion on what a democracy can and ought to look like. It also does not seem like a very controversial point of view here, perhaps because it is the status quo. It is a conservative stance, however, in the traditional meaning of that word (as opposed to the modern political stance that shares that word in name).

In Britain, most people would actually like to be part of the EU now, and it was even pretty close when the vote was taken. Aside from that difference, for those who are in favor of Brexit (then or now) it is far more about ""things are broken, we need to fix them"". There is a much bigger emphasis on the more xenophobic topics (not saying this doesn't exist at all in Switzerland; it is are found everywhere there are large numbers of people), and a far more confused and confusing take on the economic realities in their country. They had a good handle on their own currency, so that isn't *really* a big part of it; if anything Brexit was (correctly) seen as a risk to their business dealings and currency stability (which is why there was so much ""no, no.. it'll be fine!"" from the Brexit leadership on the topic of economic impact). Their democracy is pretty crap (the parliamentary system is not optimal; first-past-the-post is ridiculous; a constitutional monarchy is not exactly cutting edge governance; etc.) and it wasn't under threat anyways. Much of the push to leave the EU was because of concern over things not going well enough, not a fear that things would get worse if they didn't.

It is a conservative perspective in Britain that pushes Brexit, this is true, but it is modern political ""conservatism"".

Yes, they should.   Stagflation is incredibly rare, if it happens that's why we have politicians to enact sensible laws when the unexpected occurs.

&gt; France, which has received little public support from NATO allies in its escalating conflict with Turkey, is making its return to Operation Sea Guardian conditional on four demands: that NATO allies reaffirm their commitment to the arms embargo; outlaw the use of NATO call signs when ships are on national operations; improve coordination between Sea Guardian and the EU Operation IRINI; and the setting up of a mechanism to defuse conflict and avoid incidents among allies.

&gt; On June 10, the French frigate Le Courbet, operating under NATO command, attempted to inquire about the intended destination of a Tanzanian-flagged cargo ship, the Cirkin, but was aggressively barred from doing so by three Turkish naval ships escorting the Cirkin, according to French officials.

&gt; On June 17 and 18, French Defense Minister Florence Parly lodged a complaint at a NATO ministerial meeting and only got the support of eight allies out of a total of 30, for its criticism of Turkey&amp;#039;s behavior.

Transportation of electricity is hardly an unsolved problem.

Nuclear has a large upfront cost compared to gas power plants, and even those are partly being closed down and replaced by huge power storage units (yes, batteries!) for solar... That's why it's not being invested in right now.

Despite what many tout around, renewables are very reliable on the scale of something like the US, EU or China. There are wind streams that don't ever just stop, wave power is a constant and solar is insanely predictable and has the power output at the time where consumption matters. It's also all incredibly cheap and a fast ROI.

&gt; Voor de gemeenteverkiezingen van 2018 (redelijk representatief denk ik) liggen de percentages stemmers van niet-EU afkomst in Vlaanderen op 6,23% en in Bxl op 12,85%. Aangezien deze ook divers stemmen vaak (als in vooral links (dat 3 partijen bevat) en centrum (VLD) en heel soms zelfs centrum-rechts (NVA)) zou ik me serieuze vragen stellen bij deze extrapolaties.  
  
niet akkoord; dit zijn *niet-Belgen* in gemeenteraadsverkiezingen.  
Ik heb het zeker ook over het federale &amp; Vlaamse niveau; en dus over 'allochtone' en 'autochtone' Belgen.  
Dat aandeel zit op iets boven de 20%, in Vlaanderen (&amp; idem België)  
  
denk-experiment:  
stel:  
Groen &amp; SPA, halen beide ong 12% van de stemmen.  
een 'allochtoon', is 2x zo waarschijnlijk om Groen/SPA te stemmen, als een 'autochtoon'. (dit is absoluut een stelling; ik heb hier geen cijfers voor; het stemgeheim blijft behouden en dat is maar goed ook vanuit democratisch standpunt).  
Dan is: 12% = 80% x Y + 20% x 2 Y.  
gevraagd: Y.  
12% = 120% Y.  
Y = 10%.  
  
Dit is nog een kleine afwijking.. maar we weten gewoon niet wat % allochtonen op Groen &amp; SPA stemmen.  
Toch: 12% -&gt; 10%, dat is 1/6de minder. Naar zetels toe kan dat al een verschil opleveren.

Vooral aangezien dorpen sowieso al vaker centrum of centrum rechts stemmen tegenover steden. Dit was ook al zo voor migrantenstemrecht.

La 14 ani, in toiul lui ianuarie, am ieșit pe la 19 afara sa-mi plimb câinele. Cand m-am întors si am intrat in bloc, un nene care s-io dadea viguros a intrat dupa mine. Am luat-o repede la goană pe scari sa intru in apartament si i-am spus tatei ce s-a întâmplat, dar chiar daca el a ieșit imediat (nici nu și-a luat geaca pe el, iarna) nu l-a mai găsit pe tip.

A doua oara aveam 15 ani, si era prin martie. Eu stăteam in autobuz pe scaun (langa usa, unde sunt panouri de sticla în fata scaunelor). In fata mea, rezemat de spatele autobuzului, statea un nene la vreo 65 de ani. Pe la jumatea călătoriei, imi îndrept privirea catre el si il vad cu trompeta scoasă. M-am uitat in ochii lui încercând sa-mi comunic dezgustul, dar nimic, nenea chiar si îndreptat trompeta si mai înspre mine. Autobuzul era plin de lume dar nimeni nu zicea nici pâs, si as fi făcut scandal dar am citit ca la astia daca le zici ceva numai le dai apa la moara (au ceva fetișuri dubioase cu a fi certați, dracu știe), asa ca am sărit de pe scaun si am fugit im capătul opus al autobuzului, ca sa nu ma vada cand cobor.

&gt; **Gut:** The coronavirus infects cells that line the inside of the large and small intestine, called gut enterocytes. That likely accounts for the **diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain that about one-third of Covid-19 patients experience**, said MD Anderson’s Maitra: “The GI symptoms reflect physiological [dysfunction] of cells of the lower GI tract.”
&gt;
&gt; **Kidney:** The cells lining the tubules that filter out toxic compounds from the blood are rife with ACE2 receptors. Last month, scientists studying **1,000 Covid-19 patients at a New York City hospital reported that 78% of those in intensive care developed acute kidney injury.**
&gt;
&gt; **Smell:** An analysis of 24 studies with data from 8,438 Covid-19 patients from 13 countries found this month that **41% had lost their sense of taste or smell, or both.** That shouldn’t be surprising, said Fabio Ferreli of Humanitas University in Milan: “Perhaps the highest levels of ACE2 receptors are expressed in cells in the nasal epithelium.” The sensory loss isn’t due to nasal inflammation, swelling, or congestion, he said, “but to direct damage” to these epithelial cells. Loss of smell also impacts taste, but the virus may also have a direct effect on taste: The nference analysis found high levels of the ACE2 gene in tongue cells called keratinocytes, which contribute to the sense of taste.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lungs:** This is where a respiratory virus should strike, and SARS-CoV-2 does. The lungs’ type II alveolar cells — among other jobs, they release a compound that allows the lungs to pass oxygen to the blood and take carbon dioxide from it — are studded with ACE2 receptors. **Once infected with the coronavirus, they become dysfunctional or die, and are so swarmed by immune cells that this inflammatory response can explode into the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that strikes many patients with severe Covid-19**, Walensky said.
&gt; 
&gt; **Pancreas:** In April, scientists in China reported that there was higher expression of the gene for ACE2 in the pancreas than in the lungs. Genetic data are an indirect measure of ACE2 receptors themselves, but could have been a tip-off to physicians to monitor patients for symptoms there. As it happens, the Chinese researchers also **found blood markers for pancreas damage in Covid-19 patients, including in about 17% of those with severe disease.**
&gt;
&gt; **Heart:** **Patients with severe Covid-19 have a high incidence of cardiac arrests and arrhythmias**, scientists at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania recently found. That’s **likely due to an extreme inflammatory response, but there might be more direct effects of the coronavirus, too**. A large team of European researchers reported in April that arrhythmia (including atrial fibrillation), heart injury, and even heart failure and pulmonary embolism might reflect the fact that ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in cells along the inside walls of capillaries. When these “vascular endothelial” cells become infected, **the resulting damage can cause clots**, MGH’s Walensky said, which in turn **can cause Covid toe, strokes, and ischemic bowel** (too little blood flow to the gut). Studies from around the world suggest that **7% to 31% of Covid-19 patients experience some sort of cardiac injury**.
&gt;
&gt; **Gallbladder:** Specialized cells in this organ, too, have high levels of ACE2 receptors. **Damage to the gallbladder (like the pancreas) can cause digestive symptoms.**",True,False,False,,,,0,1593628595,,False,0,{},fwlz817,False,t3_hjfyvy,False,False,t3_hjfyvy,/r/Coronavirus/comments/hjfyvy/not_just_the_lungs_covid19_attacks_like_no_other/fwlz817/,False,,1602219046,190,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],

&gt;  
&gt;The  U.S. government announced Monday that it had an agreement with Gilead  Sciences to make the bulk of their production of remdesivir available to  Americans during the next three months. The Department of Health and  Human Services said it had secured 500,000 treatments of the drug  through September, representing 100% of Gilead’s July production  capacity and 90% of its capacity in August and September.  
&gt;  
&gt;“To  the extent possible, we want to ensure that any American patient who  needs remdesivir can get it,” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex  Azar said in a statement.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ohid Yaqub, a senior lecturer at the University of Sussex, called the U.S. agreement “disappointing news.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“It so clearly signals an unwillingness to cooperate with other countries  and the chilling effect this has on international agreements about  intellectual property rights,” Yaqub said in a statement  
&gt;  
&gt;Until now, Gilead had donated treatment courses to the U.S. and other  countries. That ended Tuesday and Gilead this week announced the price  of the treatment going forward. In 127 poor or middle-income countries,  Gilead is allowing generic makers to supply the drug.  
&gt;  
&gt;In  a statement Wednesday, the California-based Gilead said its agreement  with the U.S. allows for unneeded supplies to be sent to other  countries. The company said it is “working as quickly as possible” to  enable access worldwide. But it noted that U.S. is seeing a significant  rise in COVID cases, while “most EU and other developed countries have  reduced their levels of disease considerably.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Early trials testing remdesivir in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 found  that those who received the drug recovered quicker than those who  didn’t. It is the only drug licensed by both the U.S. and the European  Union as a treatment for those with severe illness from the coronavirus.    
&gt;  
&gt;Dr. Peter  Horby, who is running a large study testing several treatments for  COVID-19, told the BBC that “a stronger framework” was needed to ensure  fair prices and access to key medicines for people and nations around  the world. He said that as an American company, Gilead was likely under  “certain political pressures locally.”   
&gt;  
&gt;British  Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman, James Slack, declined to  criticize the United States for the move, but said the U.K. had a  “sufficient stock” of remdesivir for patients who need it, but didn’t  specify how much that was.   
&gt;  
&gt;Thomas  Senderovitz, head of the Danish Medicines Agency, told Danish  broadcaster DR that the move could endanger Europeans and others down  the road.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I  have never seen anything like that. That a company chooses to sell their  stock to only one country. It’s very strange and quite inappropriate,”  he said. “Right now we have enough to make it through the summer if the  intake of patients is as it is now. If a second wave comes, we may be  challenged.”   
&gt;  
&gt;Gilead  had been developing remdesivir for years as a viral treatment, aided by  millions in funding from the U.S. government, before it was tried for  coronavirus. The company’s statement said that Gilead is exploring ways  to support access to remdesivir beyond the U.S. and the 127 developing  countries.  
&gt;  
&gt;Dr.  Penny Ward of King’s College London, noted that many countries have  legal provisions that allow them to prohibit the exportation of drugs to  other countries during an emergency.   
&gt;  
&gt;“It  is unreasonable to expect that the U.S. government should deny their  population access to drugs manufactured in the USA,” she said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ward  pointed out that another drug that has recently shown may help people  with severe COVID-19, the cheap steroid dexamathasone, is long  off-patent and available globally.  
&gt;  
&gt;The  U.S. has the worst coronavirus outbreak in the world, with 2.6 million  reported infected and 127,000 confirmed virus-related deaths, according  to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. To date, COVID-19 has sickened  more than 10.5 million people worldwide, killing around 512,000,  according Johns Hopkins.

First I think it's better to say ""Anti-PRC"" than ""anti-China"" because I don't think most people are really against the average Chinese people. The PRC hasn't been static with public opinion on it arbitrarily shifting. Their influence globally has been rising sharply the last decade with economic growth and the blatant anti-humanitarian and anti-democratic tendencies have been getting worse the longer Xi Jinping has been in office. 

It wasn't perfect, and arguably not aggressive enough, but there was a framework and a strategy for dealing with PRC influence internationally under Obama. We were more closely allied with a lot of European countries, more actively participated in multinational agreements/organizations and he was working towards the Trans Pacific Partnership. Trump made it a trade war and made it more us-against-them but the rise of PRC influence isn't a problem that he manufactured.

&gt;The Invention of the White Race

&gt;Groundbreaking analysis of the birth of racism in America.

&gt;When the first Africans arrived in Virginia in 1619, there were no “white” people, nor, according to colonial records, would there be for another sixty years. In his seminal two-volume work, The Invention of the White Race, Allen details the creation of the “white race” by the ruling class as a method of social control, in response to labor unrest precipitated by Bacon’s Rebellion. Distinguishing European Americans from African Americans within the laboring class, white privileges enforced the myth of the white race through the years and has been central to maintaining ruling-class domination over the entire working class.

&gt;Since publication in the mid-nineties, Invention has become indispensable in debates on the origins of racial oppression in America. Volume One utilizes Irish history to show the relativity of race and racial oppression as a form of social control. Volume Two details the development of racial oppression and racial slavery in colonial Virginia and, more broadly, Anglo-America. A new introduction by Jeffrey B.

O morador do Jardim Peri, na zona Norte de São Paulo, trabalhava como técnico de amostragem em um laboratório que decretou falência. Desempregado com duas filhas para sustentar, decidiu começar a trabalhar como motorista de [Uber](https://brasil.elpais.com/tag/uber). Financiou um carro em 60 meses e hoje chega a trabalhar até 16 horas por dia para pagar as contas no fim do mês. Desde então, nunca mais tirou férias. “É um serviço quase em tempo integral. Trabalho de domingo a domingo, só paro no rodízio do meu carro na quinta-feira. Ser Uber vale a pena, mas é preciso ralar muito para pagar o aluguel. Eu estou com várias contas atrasadas, no vermelho”, lamenta Silva.

Sem muitas alternativas de empregos formais em[ um cenário de lenta recuperação econômica](https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2019/12/03/economia/1575369338_271431.html), não são poucos os brasileiros que como Silva resolveram atuar como motorista por aplicativo, inclusive alugando carros para cumprir o ofício. O número de pessoas que trabalha em veículos, que também inclui taxistas, motoristas e trocadores de ônibus, atingiu recorde e aumentou 29,2% em 2018, chegando a 3,6 milhões. O que significa 810.000 pessoas a mais em relação a 2017, segundo a Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicílios Contínua (PNAD Contínua), divulgada em dezembro pelo IBGE.

Já os que trabalham em local designado pelo empregador, patrão ou freguês, grupo que inclui os entregadores a bordo de motos e bicicleta[, muitos recrutados por aplicativo](https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2019/08/06/politica/1565115205_330204.html), também registraram a maior alta desde 2012. O número desses trabalhadores avançou quase 10% em relação a 2017, chegando a 10,1 milhões em 2018. Em um ano, 905 mil pessoas optaram por esse tipo de emprego.

“As recentes altas podem estar relacionadas ao crescimento dos serviços de transportes de passageiros e de entregas por aplicativos de celular, refletindo as mudanças na economia atual”, afirmou a pesquisadora do IBGE, Adriana Beringuay.

Aos 23 anos, Mike Nunes Bizerra resolveu tentar ganhar a vida como entregador de aplicativo após ser demitido de um supermercado, onde era registrado. Há três meses, ele paga um plano de 20 reais para alugar as bicicletas do Itaú diariamente para fazer entregas em Pinheiros, na Zona Oeste da cidade. Morador de Itaquaquecetuba, na região metropolitana de São Paulo, ele precisa viajar duas horas de ônibus para chegar ao local. “Trabalho cinco dias por semana, do meio-dia até de noite. Ganho cerca de 400 reais por semana. No fim do mês, é algo parecido com o que recebia no supermercado, mas sem nenhum direito trabalhista”, diz.

Enquanto tenta procurar um emprego formal para ter mais estabilidade financeira para sustentar a mulher, que está desempregada, e as duas filhas, Bizerra torce sempre para que um dia chuvoso não atravesse o seu caminho. “Dia de chuva fico em casa e perco um dia de trabalho, não tem jeito”, lamenta. Em 2020, ele espera conseguir tirar uma habilitação para fazer as entregas de moto. “Vai facilitar um pouco o trabalho. É cada subida que pego, mas o melhor mesmo seria um emprego com carteira”.

Há mais de dois anos, o também entregador de aplicativo, Daniel Carlos César não consegue assinar sua carteira de trabalho. O último emprego registrado foi como repositor em um mercado. “Tive um acidente doméstico, machuquei a mão e não consegui completar nem os três meses de experiência”, conta o entregador que só conseguiu uma nova renda na informalidade.

Já a vendedora ambulante Maria Elenice Alves, de 62 anos, trabalha por conta própria há mais de 20 anos e, apesar de estar vendo suas vendas diminuírem nos últimos cinco anos, não pensa em mudar de ocupação. Com o marido desempregado há mais de um ano, sua preocupação é que não tem conseguido poupar quase nada para a aposentadoria.

Ainda que nos últimos dois trimestres a taxa de desemprego tenha registrado queda -no fim de novembro atingia 11,9 milhões de pessoas- e[ a taxa de ocupação tenha chegado ao recorde de 94,4 milhões de pessoas,](https://brasil.elpais.com/economia/2019-12-27/emprego-tem-leve-melhora-e-mais-vagas-com-carteira-assinada-mas-informais-superam-e-desafiam-recuperacao.html) o grande desafio continua sendo reduzir a informalidade do mercado de trabalho. Atualmente, 38,8 milhões de brasileiros estão dentro da categoria, cerca de 41%, incluindo os que trabalham por conta própria. A informalidade gera consequências negativas, segundo especialistas, como a renda menor para os trabalhadores por ser, em geral, ocupações que pagam menos e também uma queda da contribuição para a Previdência, já que são poucos os que contribuem para o INSS.

“Analisamos a evolução do ponto de vista qualitativo ou quantitativo?

I’m italian so i’m definitely off topic, but i read all your text, and it is definitely interesting. 

I think what you said can be enlargened to a europe vs north america discussion.

I live near a base used by americans at the feet of the alps and i lived in a lot of touristic places. I noticed that canadians and US people are generally enthusiastic, always say “sorry” and are generally “happy”. At the same time, they are more dramatic in some things. Body shaming, slut shaming or racism are treated in italy in a less dramatic way and given less importance, that is a chiller but careless attitude. Like: under frollo’s videos of the disney film, when he gropes esmeralda, in the english version “omg disney went so far!” Omg disgusting, pedophilia!”

The comments on the italian version were more like “frollo ruined everything for a bit of pussy” “frollo, jerk off and get a life!” Or “esmeralda looks like x politician”. This attitude is worse, but sometimes americans overdramatize everything, and it looks somehow connected to the fact that they always look enthusiastic.

Our humorism is darker also, that’s why some consider us “racist”, while we joke on everyone, included the next town. We are still different in bitterness tha the french though.

French characters in movies look more “existentialist”, like “i’m tired of life and i look it harmless” the video of je ne peux plus dire que je t’aime in “la guerre est declarè” exudes frenchness, even if the female protagonist has an italian surname and the guy a turkish one. They all feel the weight of life.  

But their sad and sarcastic characters are not bad, they are only lost. The italian ones in the italian comedy genre, with films like Il sorpasso in the past (the head of all road movies, easy rider’s director took from it) and perfetti sconosciuti in the present, the italian characters look like buffons, make laugh, but are teared down and vivisectioned in all their pettiness, they are monsters, capable of more wickedness, maybe because we suffered hunger in the past while the french didn’t. Alberto Sordi in I mostri represent perfectly the bitterness of the commedia all’italiana.

For the theoric thing i also guess it’s a southern/western europe vs anglosaxon countries.

Our high school are super theorical, in italy it is frequent to have greek and latin as subjects (translation and literature) for all five years and even uni is pretty theorical, with a lot of oral exams. This is good because we don’t study this thing to do that thing only, but is bad because we invest less in research. 

For the nationalism: i always think the french can be autocritical but not like the italians or greeks. We are older and it’s centuries that we are not a conquerer, while the french seem to feel somehow the missing of their recent napoleone’s era.

A lot of emphasis has been placed by historians and philologists on the linguistic effects of Luther’s translation of the Bible into vernacular German. The famous story, originally stated by Luther, is that he used the every-day German of the surrounding towns to create a Bible that could be read and understood by all Germans. For historians and philologists of the 19th and early 20th centuries, this lead to teleological arguments that Luther’s Bible created a definitive form of German that allowed Germans to digest the ‘Word of God’ and thereby further adopt Luther’s Saxon dialect as the standard. But the degree to which Luther’s translation influenced the creation of modern-day Hochdeutsch is not agreed on by historians. In fact, many have instead argued against the adoption of the Luther Bible as the most significant force in creating a more standardized German language. Other factors need to be considered, especially as a Low German Bible followed soon after Luther’s (translated from Luther’s Bible into Low German), thereby ensuring that the Hanseatic dialect (based in Lübeck) would also continue to propagate in the north. And there was considerable demand for bibles in Low German! By the end of 1525 there were 13 authorized translations (compared to 22 in High German) (187). 

So Luther’s Bible cannot be the sole reason for establishing a standardized German dialect, although it most certainly did play a part. Another area given more attention by historians and linguists is the development of imperial chancelleries. The Habsburgs used das gemeine Deutsch, a dialect of western Upper Germany (around Swabia), as their chancellery language in the 1500s. Therefore, starting from Maximilian I, all Habsburg lands from the Netherlands, Burgundy, Württemburg (until Duke Ulrich was reinstalled through French funds), and Austria used das gemeine Deutsch as the language of edicts, laws, and reports (52). But what about electoral Saxony, the land where Luther was protected after the Reichstag of Worms in 1521? 

Another chancellery language developed in Saxony (Meissen). This Meissen chancellery was adopted by Mainz, and came to be used as the language of Imperial decrees and laws (Reichsabschied). This is significant as the Meissen chancellery would continue to be used as the language of the Reich until 1806 (when the Reich ceased to exist). This language continued to spread across the north for administration functions. Again, quoting from Whaley: “It was the Meissen style, too, that soon after 1500 was gradually adopted by chancelleries further north, starting with Brandenburg, and which thus contributed significantly to the long-term decline of Low German as a written language of administration” (53). Low German would continue to be used, especially in the Hansestädte for commerce, centuries after adoption of Meissen chancellery language. Whaley also carefully states that by 1550 the decline of Low German could not be considered as inevitable. 

Now all of this was just to say: Luther’s Bible was not so significant in “standardizing” language across the Reich as many had been led to believe! So far, all of this is to argue contrary (although please correct me if my interpretation was wrong!) about what you said: “I never understood why that was the case, considering the Northern cities adopted Luther's and in those days the Northern standards seem to have been extremely similar to the Dutch ones - people in the North had to learn Standard German almost as a foreign language for hundreds of years until Low German dialects became rare.”
As I hope to have shown, the Northern lands did adopt Luther’s translation from Greek and parts of the Old Testament, but 13 variations of Low German bibles printed show they did not adopt Luther’s German dialect. The adoption of Luther’s translation happened for the Dutch in this time as well (in that Luther’s German was translated into Dutch). It was not until 1637 a Dutch Bible (Statenbijbel) was printed based on a new translation of the New Testament, not based on Luther.

Nevertheless, I would be careful in assigning a singular, definite point of separation. As maybe outside of the legal and inter-polity recognized independence in 1648, there were always gradations of separation (or integration) from the Reich. As I argued above, legal scholars and Nationalists in the 1830s - 1880s created the boundaries of Deutschland based on the centuries of historical debate about what the Reich (and Germany) were. The Netherlands were not significant in this tradition. But did the Dutch consider themselves separate as a result of this Bible? I am hesitant to agree with this. I would argue that their decades of practical independence through fighting the Habsburgs, Spanish, and Holy Roman Emperors from 1566 would be a much larger, formative experience from the peasantry to the numerous members of the estates general. The act of raising funds through privateering, securing trade routes, colonization, taxation, development of textile industries and shipbuilding, etc. (I would argue) led to greater systemic changes (and thus, greater cultural separation) in Dutch society than the publishing of the Statenbijbel itself. The Dutch Bible would have played a role to many, of varying grades of importance, in defining separation from the Germans, but it is difficult to evaluate a Dutch Bible (not to reduce the importance of the Bible for early modern Dutch people!) in comparison to the multitude of changes and factors that also affected the Dutch economically, politically, geographically, culturally, societally, etc.. 

I would argue against the publishing of the Statenbijbel as the moment of separation and, if pressed, make the claim that independence in 1648 was true the breaking point. Not purely due to recognition by numerous polities across Europe of independence, but rather the enormous changes the Dutch undertook for decades to gain independence from the Habsburgs and the Reich as well as the multitude of sacrifices made along the way.

&gt; You're of the mindset that it's better to not experience anything in order to spare yourself any potential negative feelings or outcomes, and complain about how ""oh woe is me I wish I wasnt alive"" rather than make the best out of your situation or just end it. You're a hypocrite.

That's not hypocritical; I have tried and failed, and will try again if I ever believe I have a chance at succeeding. You're confused because you take the naive view that a person's nature is one monolithic, atomic thing. Rather, all of us are a compound of at least two (and maybe multiple) conflicting drives. In Schopenhauer's ontology, he pits the part of us that is Will against the part that is Reason. In von Hartmann's, we have the interests of the Unconscious pitted against our own. In the case of both Schopenhauer's Will and von Hartmann's Unconscious, it is in their interest that we continue to live and ours (as rational individuals) that we die. In the Katha Upanishad - a scripture that forms a core part of Hinduism - the idea of the duality of our nature is restated in several forms: Will vs Desire, Shreya vs. Preya, higher mind vs. lower mind, etc. We also see it in literature, like in Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.

Empirically speaking, this duality of our nature is down to the fact that evolution favours genes that produce ""evolutionarily fit"" individuals, which includes genes that irrationally predispose us to want to survive and reproduce. A gene (or set of genes) that predispose us to believe ""life is good"" despite any evidence to the contrary will be selected for and become dominant within the gene pool. This is why the opinion that life is good is a natural, instinctively formed one. It is when we try to reflect on things like life or having children that we may find logic says one thing, while our instincts say another. In this case, our conflicting drives are revealed. Even though a person might rationally want to die, they have to contend with another part of them that forces them to live. And yet an outsider is blind to these conflicting forces and so whenever we see someone behave a certain way, we imagine that ""they"" have chosen to act that way, even if the part of them that constitutes their genuine, rational self is acting as a slave to the aspect of them that craves continued life at any cost - a craving that is common to every single form of life on this planet that has any semblance of consciousness at all, and is therefore very much *not* representative of the individual.

The reason that you likely haven't understood this yet is because you haven't reflected much on life yourself - you've just gone ahead and lived it (in a way that's enviable). On account of this, most of your beliefs will be those you have inherited from instinct, and the compound nature of your individuality will not be evident.

---

&gt; I'm in the same boat. I truly believe humans have no inherent purpose on earth, I especially believe my life holds no value outside of familial relations. The difference is, rather than wallow in self pity and brood about it, I work towards something akin to a purpose for myself.

Right, existentialism. There's no objective point to life, so just make one for yourself. I don't fault you for that. If it makes your time here happier, all power to you.

&gt; And, if I should so choose to have a child or two, pass on my knowledge to them to see what they can make of it, for better or worse.

See, this is the problematic part. You and I are alive, there's not much we can do about that, so we might as well make the best of it. But that doesn't mean we need to drag others into this world. I know that no amount of argument will convince you that having kids is wrong on purely philosophical grounds. If you want to have kids, you'll just block out everything I'll say and have forgotten it all tomorrow.

Bear in mind, though, that we live in a relatively interesting time. Maybe you can look at the life you have now, imagine your children having similar lives and believe that's a fair deal for them. The thing is, their lives will probably be substantially worse than yours. This world is falling apart due to human-induced climate change. We've had 420 consecutive months where the global temperature was above the 20th-century average. We're seeing temperatures of nearly 40C (104F) in Siberia and the Arctic. By the time your future children are adults, the Arctic ice cap will no longer exist. Warming oceans will cause more frequent and intense storms and lead to increased occurrences of flooding and drought. Southern Europe will begin to desertify; central Africa will turn from savannah to hyper-arid desert. Crop yields will fall, and crops themselves will become less nutritious. Locust swarms and other pests will become increasingly problematic, as we've already witnessed this year. Insects and bees will continue to die out.

You would be making the choice to bring your children into this increasingly uninhabitable world. Even people who share the same general worldview as you, who are happy enough with their own life, are choosing not to have children out of consideration for the lives they might have. How do you justify it to yourself? Do you believe we're going to fix these problems, despite not having made a dent in the past 50 years of climate scientists warning us about this? Or do you just not really care and want to have kids to please yourself, no matter how damned they are?

---

&gt; You can actually use this as fuel in order to change yourself and add meaning to your worthless life, like many are trying to do whether they realize it or not.
&gt;
&gt; Or you can continue to sit and brood and hate the world and the concept of continuing the human race while doing nothing to pursue your thoughts for change them.

Why do you believe these are mutually exclusive? A person can make active changes and improvements in their life, bettering themselves, and still believe that the world is better off never having been. Do you not understand that many of the people who held these views have gone on to have a greater impact on the world than you or I will ever have? Do you not grasp that this isn't a worldview that a few jaded individuals hold, but is the foundation of major world religions like Hinduism and Buddhism, that paint this earthly life as an *objectively bad thing* and attempt to point the way towards salvation towards it?

&gt; If you want a safe compass to guide you through life, and to banish all doubt as to the right way of looking at it, you cannot do better than accustom yourself to regard this world as a penitentiary, a sort of a penal colony, or [Greek: ergastaerion] as the earliest philosopher called it. Amongst the Christian Fathers, Origen, with praiseworthy courage, took this view, which is further justified by certain objective theories of life. I refer, not to my own philosophy alone, but to the wisdom of all ages, as expressed in Brahmanism and Buddhism, and in the sayings of Greek philosophers like Empedocles and Pythagoras; as also by Cicero, in his remark that the wise men of old used to teach that we come into this world to pay the penalty of crime committed in another state of existence—a doctrine which formed part of the initiation into the mysteries. And Vanini—whom his contemporaries burned, finding that an easier task than to confute him—puts the same thing in a very forcible way. Man, he says, is so full of every kind of misery that, were it not repugnant to the Christian religion, I should venture to affirm that if evil spirits exist at all, they have posed into human form and are now atoning for their crimes. And true Christianity—using the word in its right sense—also regards our existence as the consequence of sin and error.",True,False,False,,,,0,1593632549,,False,0,{},fwm82ey,False,t3_hi437k,False,True,t1_fwllm4t,/r/NoahGetTheBoat/comments/hi437k/beyond_sad/fwm82ey/,False,,1602223331,1,True,False,NoahGetTheBoat,t5_117wt6,r/NoahGetTheBoat,public,,0,[],

Boulder, Colorado. I’m actually born and raised there so this might be a little biased :) I moved away with my family when I was about 13, but I visit every year. it’s famous for being right on the edge of the Rocky Mountains (perfect for hiking, white water rafting, camping, etc.), which are a beautiful backdrop for the city. Incredible food and craft beers galore, and there’s no shortage of things to do (including the states flagship university - CU Boulder). Colorado actually also has the lowest rate of obesity in America and some of the highest health stats around the country! Living in the city can be expensive but you can easily commute from any of the surrounding towns. It was also named the happiest city in the US in 2017. See also, Colorado Springs and Denver. 

Austin, Texas. This is the capitol of Texas and it’s really nothing like the rest of the state, it’s motto is even “keep Austin weird”! They’ve got a massive river running through the city that’s famous for paddle boarding, kayaking, and boating. They are also famous for food trucks and being the “live music capitol of the world”, and they have a strong academic game including UT Austin and St. Edwards University. North of Austin is also Southwestern University, the oldest university in Texas. See also, San Antonio. 

Santa Fe, New Mexico. This is a wonderful place in New Mexico that’s famous for its “artsy” scene, delicious food, and Pueblo-style architecture. It has some of the richest American history that you can get in such a new country, including the Palace of Governor’s (built in 1610). It’s in the foothills of a lovely mountainous region and has lots of ski resorts nearby. You can see a lot of Native American influence there and all over New Mexico, and learn all about the cowboy lifestyle that ruled the west. See also, Taos and Albuquerque. 

San Diego, California. This beach city is consistently ranked a top tourist destination among many other categories, which include culture, entertainment, sightseeing, sports and adventure, and food, etc. It’s beautiful beaches are spread out over 70 miles of coastline, and it has a plethora of gardens, parks, and museums - plus it’s famous zoo! See also, San Francisco. 

Portland, Maine. This northeastern seaside city is famous for its lighthouse photo ops, lobster rolls, and much more. From classic seafood joints to craft breweries, Portland boasts a bustling dining scene and lovely Victorian homes. The Old Port district has great shopping along quaint cobblestone streets and 19th-century warehouses. Eastern Promenade, a 68-acre waterfront park, is home to tons of trails and beaches. A perfect location for watching the sun set. See also, Camden. 

St. Augustine, Florida. This southeastern city was founded by the Spainish back in 1565. St. Augustine is the oldest permanent European settlement in the continental U.S., and is home to some of the country's first Spanish-colonial architecture and many historic buildings. They also had a big role in the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, and there is a Freedom Trail where you can walk in the footsteps of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. It’s also home to Castillo de San Marcos, a 17th-century fortress that features drawbridges and daily cannon fire. See also, Miami and St. Petersburg. 

I could list so much more, Charleston, S.C.; Annapolis, Maryland; Sedona, Arizona; Bozeman, Montana; Newport, RI; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Boston, Massachusetts, etc.

Não é difícil ver que ele em quase 20 anos só acertou uma vez num bom treinador. Não há um projecto ou um plano; quando ele fala em projectos e planos, está a falar do lado financeiro apenas.

Ele está aflito com a contestação e quer poder gastar muito num treinador de nomeada para acalmar os adeptos (e porque seria muito mais caro investir em reforços). O mais provável que ele vai fazer, é insistir novamente no Jesus até ele aceitar. Porque é a única coisa que ele sabe que talvez funcione.

[],,[deleted],,,,,,,dark,,,,,[],"It's not luck though, is it? My club isn't quite at the level of Germany where the fans have a seat on the board but we have a very active and influential fans representative group which has a regular dialogue with the board. I try not to self doxx, otherwise I'd point out a couple of fairly high profile things we've achieved with through this in recent years. 

Further to this though, the club has a number of finance professional fans who scrutinize the club's finances (in conjunction with the club) and the general consensus that the fans want a prudent, financially stable club is one of the guiding principles the club runs on. 

For more high profile examples of fans challenging poor financial practice, look at Blackpool (for those not familiar the majority of Blackpool fans boycotted the club's games for years, some disrupted fixtures via pitch invasions, ran leaflet and media campaigns to remove the Oyston family ftom the club).

Far too many English fans are just too placid though. It's a mark of the English love of the game thst many seem to forget that football is a discretionary spend and they can withdraw their support at any time if the club heads in a direction they don't like. Worse still are fans who turn a blind eye to their club's dodgy dealings for a hint of promised success (looking at you, bury fans).

On your point about reduction in home games, you'd see smaller squads and clubs having to take more of a chance on home grown talent instead of journeymen or premier league rejects, something I think most lower league fans would welcome.  

For instance, my club is one of many to announce it's looking at disbanding its academy (one that's produced several top flight players including two internationals over the last ten or 15 years and made the club millions of pounds) in favour of sweeping up all the premier league dropouts as their view is prem scouting operations are just too good. A change like this might reverse that policy and force clubs to keep investing in their local area instead of just recruiting identikit Scouse or glaswegian dropouts from the big academies. 

What the EFL should also look at doing is insist, like some of its European counterparts, that young players at the very least get educated to A level, if not study for a degree or profession qualification alongside plating football. That would make the decision to leave the game and pursue something else a damn sight easier in a new era of reduced wages (or more accurately fewer opportunities for marquee players) and smaller squads. 

Imagine that; teams where you had 4 or 5 players from the local community consistently who actually give a fuck about the club and might stay for a few years instead of 11 mercenaries who will fuck off at the end of their 1 or 2 year contract and never look back. Seasons where there's something riding on most games instead of waiting for that one genuinely exciting season in 5. Bigger crowds, more excitement. 

Or..... we could just plod on as we are. Biggest mistake football can make is taking the fans for granted though.

&gt; The civic malaise was clearly linked to the Covid-19 pandemic, which had already affected voter turnout in the March 15 first round, when only 55.4 percent of voters nationwide cast their ballots, obvservers said.


&gt; Many observers see the high abstention rate as a repudiation of mayors, although opinion polls show they are still the most appreciated by the French among those holding political office.


&gt; But the low turnout is the result of a wider political saturation trend, according to experts. ""With the exception of the May 2019 European parliamentary elections, which saw a resurgence in voter participation, we are gradually seeing a form of democracy based on abstentions in France,"" warned Cautrès, noting that while turnout is high for the presidential poll, other elections fail to motivate voters to cast their ballots.



&gt; In the Sopra Steria poll, 38 percent of respondents said they did not vote since they believed the elections will not change anything in their daily lives, while 27 percent said it was because they didn’t like any candidate or list.


Those I think summarize it, but its a short article.

Does anyone know if France has vote by mail or anything similar? It says nearly 60% stayed away then offers a poll saying 38% think it's pointless and 27% say they didn't like anyone.

The story is mainly based in another world, the Honkai Kingdoms world, so let's introduce the world first.


There are three nations;

- Emberya (basically China) is ruled by the Grand Seeress. This is the main nation. The capital is called Moon Emberya.

- The Holy Schicksal Empire (lies North of Emberya, basically a medieval European monarchy) is ruled by the Arch Imperator

- Jormungond (a kingdom of pirates on the coasts of Emberya and Schicksal) is ruled by the Queen Corsair


Important Characters:

(From the main world)

- Captain.

- Vodka Twins, Rozaliya and Liliya.

(From Honkai Kingdoms world)

- Zhuge Kongming [pronounced ""joo-guh kong-ming""], the 1st Grand Seeress of Emberya.

- Rita, Grand Chancellor of Emberya.

- Theresa ""TeRiRi the Magical Girl Emperyus"", popular Emberyan idol.

- Fu Hua, Arch Imperator of Schicksal.

- Himeko, Corsair Queen of Jormungond.

- Golem, a wishmaker statue hidden in the Abyssal Altar.


Note: the Abyssal Altar is the name of the ruins where Golem resides and where it's easiest to make a portal to another world. So far, three apocalyptic beasts have appeared from here.


*Event 1: Honkai Kingdoms*


Captain(you) get summoned to another world by the Vodka Twins. (The year is 1001 of the Imperial Calendar) You find out that the three nations of Schicksal, Jormungond and Emberya are at war for the wishmaker. You find out that the twins were summoned here to stop the war, they tried to use the Golem's wish-granting power but failed, so then they summoned you to help. Eventually, you figure out that Rozaliya's wish put the world into a time loop because the Golem takes wishes very literally (wishes must be grammatically and semantically foolproof). You wish that Roza's wish is cancelled out, and Golem goes to sleep, which ends the war, but you and the Vodka Twins are stuck in this world. The three of you go to the current Grand Seeress of Emberya, Theresa (who's also an idol star going by ""TeRiRi the Magical Girl Emperyus""). She tells you that the 1st Grand Seeress of Emberya, Zhuge Kongming, got immortality from Golem, and is a genius, but currently lives as a hermit, and she should know something. You and the Twins go to her, and you find out she actually summoned the twins to solve the war, and then they stole her formation(spell) to summon you. She agrees to send you back, but your thoughts of wishing for a perfect world where everyone happy messes up the transportation, and that leads into the next event.


*Event 2: Odd Drifter*


Unbeknownst to you, the isekai transportation messed up. But you return to the main world normally.

*Three years pass*

A mysterious island is found which shouldn't exist. You're knocked out and arrive stranded at this island, which is made up of four dimensions that got smushed into one island. After a few hijinks with alternate universe characters, you arrive at the central tower of the island which seems to have caused the anomalies. You then get kidnapped by the Vodka Twins at the tower. While all this happens, at the same time, a second Captain(also you) arrives on the other side of the island, and after alternate universe hijinks, arrives at the tower, teams up with everyone and saves Captain1 who was kidnapped. They then fuse into one Captain and you get your memories back. You then reach the top of the tower where Zhuge Kongming awaits. She says that she was trapped in the transportation with you because of your messup and it was your ""pathetic obsession"" with a happy world that caused you to split into two, (it's implied you split into many more instances of Captain beforehand), and caused the anomalous island. Apparently, Zhuge was trapped on the island for all those three years and observed you as Captain all that time. She timed the abduction of Captain1 to coincide with the arrival of Captain2 on the island so that you could fuse into one again and then meet her. All went according to her plan (she made use of the Vodka Twins by buying them with food).

Zhuge prepares yet another transportation formation to send herself back to her world, and you and the Vodka Twins back to yours. This time your thoughts are pure and you don't mess up, but... (this then leads on to Starlit Astrologos, the current event).


*Event 3: Honkai Kingdoms Zero*


The event before Starlit Astrologos was a prequel story-wise. It sets a lot of important character development between Captain and Zhuge.


The story opens with Captain and Kongming playing Chinese chess on the Hyperion (in the future). Apparently, in the past, Kongming's life was in grave danger and someone changed the past to save her, but this intervention wasn't good enough or did something wrong, because Captain and Kongming want to change the past again, (this future seems dark as the Hyperion is quiet and empty). So Captain uses Tesla-Zero, a time machine robot developed by Tesla, to go back in time, however, he doesn't go back in time in his own body, but possesses the body of someone in that world.


It is the year 72 of the Imperial Calendar (Jormungond and Schicksal don't exist yet). The old Emperor of Emberya has died and the realm is rife with internal conflict. The princess, heir to the throne, and granddaughter of the old Emperor, Zhuge Kongming, has gone missing. You know exactly where she is and that the 12-year old princess's life is in danger. You find her, she mistakes you for an assassin and treats you with hostility, only calling you Mr. Assassin, even after you risk your life for her many times. She eventually warms up to you. As an inventor, she loves Tesla-Zero, though Tesla-Zero dislikes Zhuge. Kongming eventually warms up to you and you find out that the her grandfather died fighting an apocalyptic beast called Amorphous. There was another apocalyptic beast before it, Yama, that destroyed half of Emberya's army before being defeated. Now Zhuge escaped the capital because she wants to set up protective formations (spells) to lessen the damage from the third apocalyptic beast that's soon to come, Houdou. With your help, she does so, while avoiding actual assassins and finding allies. In the end, Zhuge likes you so much that she drugs you to stop you going after her, as she wants to be the only one to face Houdou and seal it. Despite this, you arrive at the Abyssal Altar (where the previous two apocalyptic beasts appeared) with your allies, Rita, Tesla-Zero and others. Together, after a hard fight, Kongming hastily seals Houdou in the Abyssal Altar. Golem wakes up and asks her for her wish. She wishes for eternal peace and prosperity for Emberya. Golem says that since she and Rita make such great rulers, peace and prosperity is guaranteed if Zhuge and Rita rule Emberya, so Golem makes them both immortal (specifically ""with no greater interference, your lives will last forever"", so they stopped aging). You leave the possessed body saying to Zhuge ""see you in the distant future"", and leave Tesla-Zero behind, which runs out of power and goes into sleep mode. She and Rita then rule Emberya well, but Zhuge says she needs to maintain Houdou's seal, and becomes a hermit in the Abyssal Altar. Rita rules Emberya well as chancellor and regent to many Grand Seeresses, but centuries later, the Northern third of the Empire splits off and becomes the Holy Schicksal Empire and a pirate kingdom begins thriving on the coasts. Meanwhile at the Abyssal Altar, Zhuge tries for a 1000 years to make a world transportation formation by using Tesla-Zero (probably to try find her Mr. Assassin), and finally succeeds when she brings the Twins into her world during the wishmaker war (this leads into Honkai Kingdoms).

Russia wants what every major country wants. To grow into a competitive leading nation on par with the United States and China.

The western European countries are slowly reversing some of the progress they have made under the EU. Brexit may well be a catalyst for accelerating the return to nationalism and the breakup of the EU.

For the 3rd time, not hypothetical, me. You keep trying to talk about vague hypotheticals, I am talking about the real, concrete and tangible situation I am in. I am talking about the difference between the US system and the French system - the latter allowed me, an immigrant, to get a PhD at no cost, while the former doesn't, which makes it fundamentally flawed.

&gt;Cal grants are only available to those seeking a bachelor's of ""inferior degree."" What does that even mean?

Bachelor's OR inferior degree. Typo. Look up Cal  Grants, they aren't available for Masters and Doctorates. The basic requirement for one is to not have a bachelor's degree. So out of 10 years, only 4 will be covered by the grants in the best case scenario.

&gt;If you don't have $500 saved up, then even if school is completely free, you're not going to be able to go to school as eating is pretty important.

Wrong. In France, again, university is free and YOU ARE PAID TO ATTEND. You can have a salary as a student, which is safer income than any job (although it's less money overall) and you educate yourself at the same time. Again, the point of education is NOT AND NEVER WAS to get a job at the end, it is to become educated. Americans need to use ruses to cut all possible corners to spend as little time in university and half of their bachelor's in a lower-quality college due to financial difficulties - the objective isn't to be educated, in the US, it is to get a piece of paper to get a job, so education itself becomes the last priority for students.

&gt;But that barrier to entry is an entirely separate argument unrelated to the cost of school.

It's not. In fact, it is the very heart of the entire argument.

&gt;Also, the European system is not completely free for the type of scenarios you're talking about. Specifically non-citizen/resident.

Funny, when was the last time you did that? I spent 20+ years in the French education system and never paid a cent, *how strange.*

But you keep trying to veer away from the concrete example of my case, so ok. Let's look at actual facts instead of vague hypotheticals. You claim that anyone in the US - or at least the average American person - can get a Bachelor's degree at virtually no cost with financial aid. So that would mean that American students rarely have student loan debt, and if they do it's rather small, right? Even without any financial aid, you estimate college costs to be $32k TOTAL for a Bachelor's in California. We've been discussing what opportunities are available, let's look at the actual result of the American system.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/current/default.htm - Source

45 million Americans have student loans adding up to a total of 1.67 TRILLION dollars, which is about $35,000 per person. 69% of 2019 graduates had student loans. These are the facts for Americans in all situations combined, not just me. You cannot deny them.

Your claim is that anyone who cannot afford college has access to financial support that let them get out of the education circuit with minimal costs ($4k in California), and anyone who does not qualify for financial aid can afford the cost to begin with. Then, why does a vast majority of American students have such massive debt if the US system works?

If your only answer is ""Well **I** managed to do it with little to no debt,"" then you're one of the kittens who didn't eat the poisoned food, congratulations! But a system that fails to address the needs of at least 69% of its members is a failed system.

Additionally, the facts above are only from students who did, in fact, get an education. It does not account for the biggest part of my argument, which is that the US does not give a fair path to education to its poorest and underprivileged residents. 69% of American students have debt, yes, but a large amount of Americans don't have student loan debt **because it was too expensive to even attempt to get an education to begin with.** 63% of Americans cannot afford $500, you really think that they're ready to take on a $35,000 loan just for a basic diploma? And even among the ones who do take on that expense, how many are willing to go beyond the most basic of education and get another loan for a Master's or PhD? The US system is structurally made to incentivize students to get their job-requirement paper as fast as possible by achieving as little actual education as possible.

Because it's was came up with by one as a result of doing some Marxian analysis?  I mean, it doesn't get much more Marxist than that does it?

&gt;I don't expect people to just accept it. I expect people to try to understand it before getting all pissy about it, especially when it's often people who are pointing out, quite rightly at times, that word racist is overused. Yet there they are using it in a case where it clearly doesn't apply.

I have attempted to do that.  And it's bullshit.  As far as the UK is concerned I find it pretty unarguably bullshit, maybe in the US it might have some valid points but even the guy who came up with it was talking about colonial history in the context of what is now the US, not Europe.  And his empirical evidence is minimal.  ""White people are not mentioned until 1650"", uh what?I don't talk about 'white people' in my general discourse either if everybody around me is white.  Why differentiate?  It's the same reason why 'white couple' is inadvertently google bombed with bad news, because the word is only used to contextualise in a mixed environment which probably didn't exist in the very earliest days of colonial settlement, I kinda doubt the very first wave of settlers had African slaves in large numbers.  The triangle trade came later.

It's not surprising because the whole thesis is begging the question.  It's not describing reality, he's trying to come up with a reason to justify his position.  Its ass backwards, like a lot of social science.  A lot of garbage is built on this.  Having a Theodore Allen citation to your reasoning is not proof you are correct.  It means you're on a foundation of sand.  This stuff is fundamentally pretty evidence free / anecdotal.  You could survey this stuff, if you wanted to.

But I'm not really interested in arguing the toss about its validity in the US as that side of the debate has nothing to do with us here in the UK.

&gt;'m also not so sure that I agree with it. While American and European history are linked, the language comes from an imbalance that is more pronounced there than here.

Right.

&gt;Terms keep changing, I think it's worth getting better terms, and not holding to the old ones, especially when they are demonstrably false, or not useful.

I find the Merriam-Webster version of the term quite helpful myself?  What's demonstrably false about it.  What meaning do you think the guy who wrote that label had in mind - is it completely unintelligible to you?  Somehow I doubt it.   I think it's pretty clear what it means.  i also think it's pretty clear to the person who tore it up, which is why they got angry and virtue signalled on social media.

If I genuinely believed what these cultural studies types profess they do, and someone stuck that label on my bike, and I wasn't a massive racist, I would say something like this.

""This man is talking at cross purposes with me, we are using radically different versions of this word.  I am using it to mean a system of invented colonial oppression which is nothing to do with this 'white race or culture' that he thinks.  I don't think that even meaningfully exists, because of course I'm not talking about skin pigmentation or even white culture, which are the meanings of the word that he is probably familiar with, the dictionary meanings.  If I was using the word as he is, the dictionary definition, I wouldn't have a problem with it, because of course all lives matter.  However, that is not what I was saying, this structure of oppression exists outside of that, and therefore blahblah.  We need to explain this more so that people don't get the wrong message - I'm not saying this man and other pale-skinned people's lives don't matter, I'm not saying their culture is under threat, I'm just trying to help the racially disadvantaged..""  You get the picture.  That's internally logical and constructive, with their professed beliefs.

They never do that though, do they.  They get angry, they rant about fascists, they want the people who are just using the word wrong ruined.  If they are just using a different definition there's absolutely no reason to get so worked up.  They merely need to explain they are using a different definition, not get so emotional.

Dr Gopal's pet research seems to focus on how the oppressed peoples in the British Empire contributed to British identity and indeed the empire itself.  Okay.   That doesn't mean the British didn't contribute the majorty though, and it doesn't mean British culture (for thats what she really means by 'white culture' it seems to me) doesn't exist.  obviously it does.  And it pisses her right off!

Seems much more likely to me that this quibbling over definition is just a smokescreen.  They certainly act like it is.  They don't talk like people who are misunderstood or misunderstand.  They do like posting inflammatory shit with mealy mouthed cop-outs though to cover their ass.  I find the current narrative a lot closer to 20th century totalitarianism than any new definitions.

It seems that later Snori perhaps took inspiration from this and also included Hengist to be descended from Woden in the Prose Edda.


The thing I find most interesting is the idea of the ""divine horse twins"" from the Indo-European culture and that this somehow inspired the notion of Hengist and Horsa. It probably existed deep within the psyche and folklore of the Germanic people. The idea of conquering twins coming from the east would have been a very familiar idea to the people at the time. We see this myth repeated in other European cultures, like the twins Castor and Pollux in the Roman and Greek mythology for example.

* Jim Broadbent wrote a fine and broadly fantastical graphic novel, [**Dull Margaret**](https://www.comicsbeat.com/review-jim-broadbents-dull-margaret-is-dark-humanity-distilled-to-its-essence/) based on the Bruegel painting. Follows Margaret herself as she makes potions of sorts, does things with a broomstick, goes on trippy vision quests. Her depiction here, as drawn by artist Dix, pulls from Bruegel and Bosch but also a lot from the witches of Goya's black paintings. It's a very murky sort of narrative but she's a well-realised character: angry, sad, unpleasant, intensely lonely, justifiably aggrieved with the world. Apart from the trippy bits and hellish visions it's overall sadder, eerier, more mundane and more menacing than Bosch's chaotic works but it's well worth a look.

* Kate Heartfield’s **Armed in her Fashion** also works. Hell has come to earth, specifically 14th century Bruges and specifically a mountain-sized hellbeast from whose jaws demonic legions march. Everything is chaos and plague, cities are falling and everything is borderline apocalyptic. It follows the widow Margriet de Vos (eh? eh?), who has seen her dead husband come back as a revenant to steal a cache of gold hidden under her house, which Margriet could have used for their daughter's dowry had he ever told about it. She is furious. She gets her big knife and sets out to take back what is rightly hers, even if she has to venture into the Hellmouth itself. Without spoiling anything, Hell has a lot of Boschian chimeric soliders, former humans who have had their body changed so they have, say, grasshopper's legs or other things plucked straight from the paintings. It even has a clever reference to the *other* Mad Meg, the [colossal cannon in Ghent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dulle_Griet).

* I'd also recommend Christopher Buehlman's **Between Two Fires**.

Overall, from what the WSJ reported, if they succeeded in getting both Fox and Sky with private equity involved, the US entertainment operations would've been handed over to private equity control and Comcast controlling both Star and Sky.

Since i don't live at your place, first we will have just online relationships for a couple months, until we decide to have me visit you, and in the time of my visit we will see if we want to marry

Perfect time for me from the day we start chatting to the day we marry is something like 6 months, but ofcourse its depends on many things

It's ok if you want to discuss details and timings of this, i can talk about it for sure, but if you don't interested in this plan at all, then you can not waste your time reading next 🙂

Medium answer is: I'm not against international cooperation but the European Union is institutionalizing a neoliberal political project I don't like, mostly through propaganda and political blackmail when some citizens complain about the human costs of economical reforms. Here is the long answer: the European Union is actually weakening the citizens of the member nations in the global economy, because the change from european community to european union has been develloped to create a neoliberal political entity. Neoliberalism believes a natural selection of the most efficent companies through free market policies would bring prices down increasing the purchase power of the citizens and in the meantime create jobs in other sectors, this has yet to happen after 20 years of reforms, truth is the nations that went into the euro currency with higer debt are stuck in (and loosing) a race to the bottom with the eastern european countries that thanks to the educational system and the relative poverty can provide fairly qualified workers at a cost that has no match for the other economies, but there is a cieling to the growth they are experiencing right now, while in the euro zone periphery we are chipping away so many worker rights that the advantages as consumer are one order of magnitude smaller, this is an effect of the euro currency fixed exchange and the schoengen agreement combined. Meanwhile te recipt is always to privatize services to reduce national debt, because of the maastrict agreement combined with the ECB ban on debt relieve, and also anti dumping laws included in the schoengen agreement push for privatizations. Having no rules on fiscal policies combined with the schoengen agreement makes so that less populated countries can lower taxes attracting foreign capitals while providing services with the new revenues, while bigger countries would never be able to attract so much capital to be significant at a per capita level and see their tax revenue ""stolen"" by countries like malta, or the netherlands. The ECB price stability main mission combined with the fixed exchancge rates makes so that unemployment in the euro zone is growing in time. I also don't like how the parlament is elected, smaller countires have more representation than bigger ones, I think a maltese citizen's vote has 10 times more value than a german citizen's one, so centrist parties can focus just on the smaller countires to keep their majority while neglecting the interests of the majority of the population.

So basically it reduced labour strikes frequency killing working rights, it opened the possibility to seek working opportunities abroad but in a growing unemployment enviroment, it reduced consumer prices but raised basic services' costs more, it reduced inflation making credit harder to repay, could keep countires at peace but just those that were military allied even before it's creation.

By your logic, EVERY flag on earth is a symbol of hatred. Pick any country on earth. Somewhere on earth, someone hates that country. So to them, the flag of that country is a symbol of hate.

&gt;The US flag was flown, on the way to Africa to literally rape, pillage, steal, murder, and buy slaves to bring them back to the US,

No it wasn't. Even at the height of the slave trade, that was illegal. We literally made that illegal in the USA in 1700s just a few short years after we won the Revolutionary War. Look up the Slave Trade Act of 1794. Perhaps a few Americans still did? But if so, they were outlaws and pirates.

The people who were actually raiding African tribes to kidnap people and sell them as slaves were mostly other Africans.

On another note, slavery was ALWAYS illegal in the northern USA, which at the time of the Civil War accounted for about 2/3 of our nation's population. The only reason we didn't outlaw slavery entirely in 1776 was because we knew it would cause the South to defect, and we couldn't beat England without staying united. But we literally outlawed slavery everywhere within our country within a single human lifetime of the founding of our country, just 87 years later. That's not bad, considering at the time that only a handful of other nations had taken such extreme anti-slavery measures. It was still legal in most of the world.

If anything, the American flag is a symbol AGAINST slavery... not for it...

&gt;On top of this, it's been flown in unjust wars against people who didn't even attack us. Japan, and Afghanistan aside, as those are a bit more complicated, it was flown against Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Iran, Mexico, and others. Millions of innocent people...dead.

We fought in Vietnam and Korea to PREVENT the spread of Communism. We were fighting against cruel dictators, not against Korea or Vietnam. We fought WITH Korea and Vietnam. Yes, millions dead... BUt Communism was responsible for over 100 million dead in the 20th century alone. Had we not slowed the spread of it where we did, far more people would have died. And they wouldn't have died quickly by gunshot in a war... They would have died being tortured and worked to death in a prison camp.

Iran? We have literally never been at war with Iran. Iraq invaded peaceful Kuwait in an attempt to take over the country and enslave it's people under a cruel dictatorship. We stopped that. We stood for freedom. The 2nd war in Iraq didn't have the same justification, but let's be honest, Saddam needed to go. Numerous human rights violations within his country. We didn't foresee that war leading to so much other war and destruction, but we can't be perfect. We tried to do a good thing for the most people, and sometimes it doesn't work out.

&gt; Not even enslaved, just straight up murdered.

It's not murder when a guy is trying to kill and enslave a bunch of innocent people, and we kill that guy to prevent that...

I people hate us for standing against tyranny and slavery... then so be it... That's their problem, but it's not a problem with us, or our flag.

This same flag that you believe stands for hatred flies over Hong Kong right now, flown by people who have never even been to America, simply because they believe it stands for freedom and justice... not hatred...

The same flag you believe stands for hatred was flown over the beaches of Normandy, where American men gave up their lives to help the European people living under the Nazi regime. We did not have to do that. We could have left them alone to solve their own problems. But we saw a people in need, and we willingly came to help, because we believe all people should be free...

That same flag is flown by soldiers, as they hand out food and clean water to the people of any nation we invade, after their own country has failed to provide them these basic needs. It is flown by our soldiers and volunteers as we rebuild their homes and their schools, so that when we leave their country, we leave it in better shape than when we found it.

That same flag you believe stands for hatred was flown by politicians and leaders who pushed through landmark Civil Rights Acts, ensuring equality for all. It is flown by missionaries, and charitable organizations, who travel to the poorest regions of the world to build schools and libraries, feed and clothe children, all at the expense of the American people who willingly gave up some of their wealth in order to help others.

The same flag you believe stands for hatred is the only flag to stand on the moon, as a testament to our cultural and scientific achievements, of not just America, but for all of mankind.

The American flag is the flag is flown in secret all over the world by millions of poor and oppressed people, who hope to one day live here, where they can have freedoms not allowed in their home country, and where they hope to build a new life. It is flown PROUDLY by over a million people very year, of all races and nationalities, as they finally gain US citizenship...

I did think about it, and thought about who Rapinoe would be in men's football and how dumb it would be if they won the Ballon d'Or. It's hard to make a fair comparison for multiple reasons: women's football doesn't have an established system of market values (like the ones from Transfermarkt), there is less European dominance which makes it harder to establish which are the best leagues, and the WC obviously bears more weight relative to the national leagues or to the CL than in men's football.

.... however, this is what I have thought of:

* It's hard to say how good the NWST is relative to the European leagues (which are themselves ranked in the UEFA coefficient ranking). Basing it on the quality of players, I would most likely rank it **second or third in the world,** after the French league (first in the UEFA rankings) and either before the German league (second in the UEFA rankings) or after the German league and before the English league (third in the UEFA rankings). This puts it on par with the second or third league in the UEFA coefficient rankings (as there are obviously no non-European leagues so high up), which are currently the **English Premier League** and the **German Bundesliga**.
* Now that we have established the possible leagues, which team would she be in? Her team, Reign FC, finished the 2019 season 4th out of 9, so at mid-table, slightly in the upper half (or exactly at half since there's an uneven number), so that can be the 8th, 9th or 10th place in the Prem, or the 7th, 8th or 9th place in the Bundesliga. Taking last season's standings, these teams would be **Everton, Leicester, West Ham, Eintracht Frankfurt, Werder Bremen or Hoffenheim**.
* Next, what time of player she is? She is mostly deployed as a winger, although she can also play as a second striker or attacking midfielder. So that defines her tactical profile, but what about her place in the team and record last season? Out of 24 games, she has played 5 (21%), although only 3 as a starter (12.5%). Out of Reign's attacking-minded players, there are 8 players (Balcer, Yanez, Onumonu, Jenkins, Taylor, Groom, White, Fishlock) who have had more minutes than her in 2019 in the NWSL, so she seems far from being a first choice and usually not even a second choice in her team. In terms of key stats, she hasn't had a single goal or assist in the league in 2019.
* Which brings me to the comparable players: attacking players from the teams I mentioned above who haven't managed to break into the first team (also not on a rotation basis), and who have had poor returns last season. I get the following list:
   * Ademola Lookman
   * Harvey Barnes
   * Rachid Ghezzal
   * Andy Carroll
   * Grady Diangana
   * Florian Kainz
   * Steven Zuber
   * Vincenzo Grifo

So yeah, imagine any of these 8 lads getting the Ballon d'Or. Or even being nominated. Or even being in the non-ironic discussion. Or even being in the ironic discussion (well, maybe except for Andy Carroll).

I know that I didn't consider the World Cup and it played a huge role, but I wanted to look over what is generally supposed to be assessed in the Ballon d'Or - being *constantly* good over a whole year.

I don't want to take anything away from her because she is still a decent player and she showed it in the World Cup, but there are so many good players out there who are actually putting in great performances every week, not just 1-2 games per year. Like others pointed out already, it's also not her fault that she won this prize, so I am not blaming her here, but the muppets who never watched a women's game but voted her because they saw her on the news.

Here is what you got wrong and apparently they are not still teaching the full history as they did when I was in school. The fact that Black Powder production was highly controlled in Europe and Nitre, a critical part of making Black Powder is a leachate from manure, and in 1700's Europe and colonial America the contents of barnyards, outhouses, and bat-cave deposits were considered the property of the government.   The next point is that the logistical lines of the American colony was not as short as you think since many of the caves, and plantation in the south mainly allied with the British so a lot of the powder came from France which had to be shipped from across the same ocean.

&amp;#x200B;

 Part 2 - Manifest Destiny 

You completely missed the reason, or left it out because it didn't support your view, why was because of the searching for the northwest passage and were entering what was considered American territorial waters. You also failed to mention how Britain had been kidnapping American ship crews at sea to supplement their navies needs due to the war with France that was not going that well for them and only had ended about a year or so earlier. If you had done any research you would know the four reasons for the Monroe Doctrine. 1)  the United States would not interfere in the internal affairs of or the wars between European powers 2)  the United States recognized and would not interfere with existing colonies and dependencies in the Western Hemisphere 3)  the Western Hemisphere was closed to future colonization 4)  any attempt by a European power to oppress or control any nation in the  Western Hemisphere would be viewed as a hostile act against the United  States.  Remember that during this time frame that we had fought Britain twice, we had put our Marines boots up the Barbary coast pirates butts which Europe was too afraid to deal with. The Monroe Doctrine actually worked until 1933 when Britain re-invaded the Malvina Island which are also know as the Falkland Islands and the US did not get involved like promised.

&amp;#x200B;

 Part 3 - World War II History 

Oh my, I just don't know which of the incorrect information to start point out as wrong and why because there are so many points. Your comments of how nothing could reach us is so wrong since if you care to look at all of the huge number of tonnage of sunken, over 3,000,000 tons, by sinking 609 merchant ships from WWII that lay off the coast of North Carolina alone that it got the name Torpedo alley. The Germans were so bold about it that not only did they send their type 9 boat which was intended to cross oceans, but they also sent their much smaller type 7 U-boats which were intended only for waters from Germany to England. The American Navy, the American Coast Guard for their much forgotten efforts during WWII, Army Air Corp often working together sank a good number of them. German was also had a group of U-boats that had been converted specially for launching both V-1 and the newer V-2 and was such an issue that the Navy deployed forty-six ships and dozens of aircraft to  annihilate the incoming submarine wolf pack. The battle that followed  saw hundreds of lives lost at sea, and showed American intelligence  services at their very best—*and* worst. If you had paid attention in history class you would also know that America's faith in the distance of the Oceans protecting us was  **destroyed** by the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor. Also the Germans were almost finished working on the Amerika rocket also known as the A-10. If you are thinking but they didn't I would also point out to you that if people had paid attention the US would have not only had the first jet fighter, but also the first supersonic jet fighter before WWII started because of the Lockheed L-133 and more than likely playing the same game of what if nobody would have attacked us because of how fast the planes could have caught up to their planes and shot them down.",True,False,False,,,,1,1593645306,,False,0,{},fwmzp0u,False,t3_hjbo8h,False,True,t1_fwlq7qq,/r/nottheonion/comments/hjbo8h/no_thank_you_dr_fauci_lt_gov_patrick_says_he_wont/fwmzp0u/,False,,1602236628,0,True,False,nottheonion,t5_2qnts,r/nottheonion,public,,0,[],

That being said, the main issue I have with it is that it sounds like the crafter class will still only exist on paper at the end of this 90 days. I do see that as a problem. Crafters are supposed to be a huge cornerstone of this game and they need to be in the game during this 90 days, not next year. If crafters aren't important enough to balance into the combat systems of the game, what is the point of having a separate crafter class at all?

&gt; [A] group of doctors who spoke for two and a half hours in a live, “they said that **Ivermectin**, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are capable of stopping the malignancy of the virus, it is able to greatly reduce viral load and the person does not get sick.

That would be an interesting video, if it's captured somewhere (and has English subtitles!).

The article:

&gt; Anesthetist Dr. Eliomar Andrade da Silva defended the use of a medication still under study, **Ivermectin** against the prevention of the new coronavirus at Live do Voz da Bahia in the program Half-Day and Half this Tuesday (30). According to the anesthetist, the controversial medication still under study is not new, but for him, not everyone has the necessary knowledge.

&gt; #IVERMECTIN :

&gt; Although unknown to many people, **Ivermectin** is a dewormer responsible for one of the largest health interventions in African and Latin American countries in the last 40 years. It is a medication that is part of the group of antiparasitic agents with action on various worms and parasites, in addition to combating mites. This drug **can only be sold under medical prescription** and due to the wide use of this drug for more than 60 years, it is considered very safe. However, it is important to use it rationally, appropriately, in the right dose and for an adequate time.

A number of Brazilians have posted that you can buy **ivermectin** over-the-counter in Brazil. This guy would know, though. Has the drug's OTC status changed?

&gt; #ANESTHESIST DR. ELIOMAR:

&gt; Eliomar starts his speech by saying he is against isolation. According to him, there should be no quarantine for healthy people, “the quarantine is for sick people or at most people who were at risk of becoming infected and seriously ill, so from the beginning even before Europe and certain countries they all leave for street wearing a mask and gloves to remind you that, you should not touch your hand on your face, because the virus does not enter through the skin, it enters through the nasal mucous membranes in the eye or mouth, so what is to advocate, from the beginning it is all on the street, everyone working in masks and gloves ”, he explains.

&gt; The anesthetist reinforces that the use of the mask prevents the proliferation of the virus, because when the person sneezes, coughs or speaks the mask protects the person.

&gt; Eliomar also states that the coronavirus is not lethal like Ebola, “if it were lethal, I would particularly stay in the bush so as not to contaminate myself, but we know that the huge percentage of people, they do not even have the disease. I'm not going to say a little flu to not think that I am a Bolsonarist, but Dr. Drauzio Varella had this initial conversation and that Bolsonaro simply copied it, but it's true, the truth is that the huge percentage of people, maybe 80%, so why can't I say that a small fraction of the population has a cold and the other even smaller fraction gets seriously ill to the point of needing an ICU? So it has been known since the beginning that the virus is not violent and is not lethal to most. I am not talking lethal to those who have low immunity, ”he explains.

&gt; Still on social isolation, Eliomar Andrade says that leaving the large mass of productive people at home is a catastrophe, “if the productive mass were working we would not have this second one, which is unemployment, people in Brazil already have difficulty in finding a job, our poor already have difficulties, they live with great difficulty, most people earn less than a minimum wage. The world is divided into two types of people: employee and employer there is no third type, only the employee and the employer. Those people who have the skill and money to start a company, who have the skill and the money will be employed and who have neither the skill nor the money will be employed as well, so we need to keep employers and employees, but they are arresting everyone and we will not have taxes,

&gt; Regarding testing, Dr. Eliomar states that if there was the knowledge that is being presented today, there would be no need to carry out such tests, “prevention is cheap and easy, prophylaxis is that you don't get sick. These substances we are going to comment on already existed before the pandemic and if it were well placed, if Brazil were not divided as it is divided and they were all for each other, specialists would have sat down, passing on the knowledge about the medications and from the beginning, everyone was working, ”he says.

&gt; The anesthetist points out that he is not a researcher, just a scholar who accompanies a group of doctors who spoke for two and a half hours in a live, “they said that **Ivermectin**, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are capable of stopping the malignancy of the virus, it is able to greatly reduce viral load and the person does not get sick. **Ivermectin** has no side effect, and when I say side effect, it is the use of it in the therapeutic dose, the drug has a toxic effect if you take five, six or ten times more than the therapeutic dose, then you will have a toxic effect , but for those who use the therapeutic dose it has no side effect ”, he says.

Doctors think ivermectin works!

I assume that the therapeutic dose is defined as 200mgc/kg -- the usual dose everywhere, apparently because the FDA approved that dose for scabies.

It's been shown that 10 times that dose is safe.

&gt; Still on **Ivermectin**, the anesthetist clarifies that it is the Ivomec drug, “veterinarians prescribe 07 mg per kilogram of live weight and the animal can only be slaughtered 6 months later, and during this period, the medication is effective in the the animal's body and also our body because **Ivermectin** has trophism (maintaining healthy muscles) by fat; the fat absorbs and stays attached to it, it leads visceral fat ”, he explains.

Another statement that ivermectin accumulates in fat. TIL for me, today. That's two statements of this fact -- the other applying to bugs.

&gt; #CAN NOT BE USED:

&gt; On counter-recommendation, Dr Eliomar clarifies that the drug should not be used by pregnant women or those who are breastfeeding, in addition, children under five years or under 15 pounds are also not recommended to use the medicine , “And it should not be used in people who are affected by this barrier, and we only know meningitis with inflamed cells, because it will give **Ivermectin** to the brain and the person will have seizures, delusions or things that affect the central nervous system ”, he explained.

The meningitis concern may be valid, I don't know. The others are nonsense: a study safely dosed infants and children under 15kg, and literally millions of pregnant women have taken the drug in Mass Drug Adminstrations against parasites without reports of birth defects -- 100s of millions or more, over the 20+ years of MDAs.

Edit: Meningitis is not mentioned in [WebMD's list of ivermectin contraindations](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-1122/ivermectin-oral/details/list-contraindications). This case study of [recurring meningitis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4350558/) recommends ivermectin over another drug.

&gt; #“THE POOR DO NOT USE IT”:

&gt; Andrade explains that **Ivermectin** and hydroxychloroquine are being used, according to him, by doctors, politicians and authorities, “all the people who have good information are using these substances, except that they are not using **Ivermectin** are the poor. So I tell you the following: health is a right of the people and a duty of the state, the free will we have and the right to come must also be respected in Brazil and in the world. Arrest people inside the house? They are contaminating themselves in the same way. The authorities should take care of people's health; those who have money have already been using **Ivermectin** and the other doses and they are not getting sick, it is rare for you to hear that a person well positioned in society both culturally and economically died, we do not see this, so I propose that they all come back working, open the city and may governors and mayors who have usurped our right to come and go, liberate us. I don't want to get into controversy or say anything from the right or the left, but I want to say that these people have betrayed our people, they are shaming our people, they are all trapped inside the house, we are going to release all people, take people to to work, these governors and mayors I consider as traitors to the people, they need to let the people work and I tell you the poor people of this country, you need at home to pray for the authorities to have the wisdom to truly care for the population ”, he concludes.

Not following the logic: wealthy people are using ivermectin, so open the economy?

&gt; #THE CONTRADITORY:

&gt; As it is a remedy widely used in cases of worms, the gastroenterologist and endoscopist Roseane Bicalho Assis is familiar with **ivermectin** and Jornal Gazeta points out the risks of the population following such guidance. In short, she said that using it prophylactically does not make sense.

&gt; According to the label of an **ivermectin** brand, the substance can cause malaise, diarrhea, headache and lack of disposition - symptoms reported by Covid-19 patients in Espírito Santo. ""It is a drug considered safe, but it can lead to liver (liver) and kidney changes"", warned the doctor.

Mas já tive experiência como motorista de Uber em 2019.

Na minha capital, há uma população em torno de 1 milhão.

Na época da discussão da regulamentação aqui em Maceió, a prefeitura tinha calculado haver em torno de 7 mil motoristas de aplicativo.

Eu acredito que seja menor, mas por não ser uma cidade tão grande como São Paulo, a concentração é muito grande na parte baixa da cidade.

Em dia bom, você fazia uns 12 reais por hora, talvez até conseguia uma viagem de uma hora para o aeroporto para tirar uns 35 reais mas voltava batendo lata. O aeroporto não tem um grande número de vôos saindo e chegando ao mesmo tempo, então você ficava até 3 horas na fila do aeroporto para conseguir uma viagem de volta, então muita gente preferia voltar.

Pessoal costumava trabalhar 12 a 14 horas por dia.

Em dia ruim, você tirava uns 7 reais por hora, as vezes sem receber chamada durante uma hora.

Tinha dia que você voltava para casa com seus 140 reais.

Tinha dia que era 70 reais. Já tive dia de voltar com 40 reais.

Tinha horário de pico, principalmente nas horas do rush, almoço e final da tarde, início da noite, assim como algum evento. Mas costumava durar pouco, talvez 10 minutos. 30 minutos se for muito movimentado. Mas geralmente só dava para completar uma viagem antes de acabar esse pico.

Fins de semana costumava ser bom mais no início da manhã e final da noite, com pessoal indo para os bares e voltando dos bares. As vezes tinha algum movimento por volta das meia noite tmbm.

Dava para tirar uns 180 reais com 12hs de trabalho em um sábado. Mas dependia muito do movimento.

Diria que no mês mediano seria em torno de 2.400 reais, com 6 dias de trabalho de 12 a 14hs por dia.

Aluguel de carro particular para Uber, girava em torno de 300 reais por semana (1200 reais por mês), com gás.

Aluguel de carro por uma empresa como a Localiza, em torno de 1350 a 1500 reais por mês, dependendo da km contratada, flex.

Carro próprio, vai depender muito do valor que pagou no carro, prestações, seguro, manutenção...

Como motorista de Uber, na minha cidade, nem sempre vale a pena. Ganhar 2.400,00 para sobrar 1.000 reais ou menos? Parece bom, mas sinceramente acredito que as pessoas fazem por necessidade, mas tão logo elas entram nessa vida, já estão procurando outro emprego. Que não faça ele trabalhar 14hs por dia, muitas vezes sem almoçar ou jantar para não perder corrida e não gastar dinheiro comendo fora.

Acredito que os motoboys devem ter custos bem menores, e por ser entrega, acaba sendo mais rápido e ágil. Acredito que o que deve ser foda é chegar no restaurante e o pedido não estar pronto.

Motorista não. Você pega uma entrega para um lugar a 5 mins de distância que acaba se tornando 20 minutos. A pessoa desce do prédio, entra no carro, você pega um sinal, algum trânsito, para o carro, a pessoa demora para sair, as vezes tem alguma mala ou carrinho de bebê no porta-malas.

Wrong. I threw your argument back on your face. I was clearly talking about radical Islam. I asked you a question that forced you to see the fact that bringing up Christianity... When talking about radical Islam... Is nothing but a strawman argument. 

**Mr_Fraunces:** Christianity was spread to Central and South America on the point of a sword. 

Not exactly. The physical conquest was done to force the original inhabitants to accept Spain's rule over their territories. Gold and other valuable resources were the main driving force behind the Conquistadores' actions. 

The Conquistadores were Soldiers, the task of evangelizing was done at the hands of the Christian Friars.  

Not all of the  Indians were initially required to convert to Christianity. Evangelization occurred in conjunction with colonization. More subtle means were used, by the colonial government, to try to force the Indians to convert, like denying them certain rights, taking their property, etc. Was violence also used? Yes, but not to the extent that people believe. It had gotten to the point that the Spanish Friars themselves argued against forced conversions... They actually advanced equal rights arguments with regards to those who were Christians and the natives who did not convert to Christianity... A concept that exists in scripture. 

**Mr_Fraunces:** As a way to celebrate the Reconquista the king and queen sent Columbus in search of new lands to conquer. When Columbus ships sailed their sails bore the cross of the Templars. 

No, it wasn't a way to celebrate the Reconquista... Something that had been occurring for centuries. They completed the Reconquista by defeating the last Islamic hold on the Iberian Peninsula. But that did not cause them to send Columbus out west. 

What drove Columbus's push out west were actions by the actions of the Muslims in the Eastern Mediterranean. They shut Europe out from the Silk Road. The Europeans had to trade directly on the Mediterranean end of the Silk Road, with Muslim Merchants. European merchants paid more for goods than what they normally would if they were able to transit the silk road or to trade directly with the Asians via the silk road. 

Result? The Europeans worked on ways to circumvent the Silk Road to get to East Asia. The Portuguese circumnavigated Africa. 

Christopher Columbus recommended the breaking of a paradigm... Pushing straight west. Columbus didn't go out to search for new land to conquer. He wanted to establish a maritime trade route to China straight from Europe via a westward transit.  

When he landed on one of the islands in the Americas, he thought that he had landed in the Asian Indies. 

The age of exploration started out partly as a way to re-establish what was lost when the Muslims shut the Silk Road. It wasn't until they realized that they discovered new lands that they set out exploring, then conquering, the Americas. 

**Mr_Fraunces:** Christianity is just as expansionist as Islam. **[STRAWMAN]**

This is a strawman argument, as there's a difference between their current objectives. The Christians want to evangelize, but not take over countries. Calling for the conquest of the entire world for Christianity is not something that you'd hear at most Christian services, regardless of denomination. The Church isn't calling for people to refuse to adapt to the laws and customs of the local nation. 

Contrast this with the following, from a Islamic Scholar on a video posted to his mosque's Facebook page: 

""No one should be fooled, no one should be beguiled, to think that Muslims are to be sitting around pacifist kumbaya when the revolution comes. That's not Quranic."" 

""Yes, it is what Quran says. Yes, it is what Muhammad did. That is the model. That's the model that we are using when we go out and engage the world and take over the world and make the world look like Allah wants it to be."" 

These are a couple of statements that Islamic Scholar Soleiman Hamed made during a speech he uploaded onto his Mosque's Facebook page. This is not an anomaly. It's a part of the norm, I've seen numerous video such as this for 15/16 years.

&gt;First, it was always there even when Italy was doing better than EURO4. 

&gt;Second, in regards to taxing shadow economy for example, people in low-wage informal employment may not pay income tax, but also don't receive social benefits. As a result, the % of unemployed people in Italy who effectively receive unemployment benefits is really low. Usually people at the lower end of the labour market receive more in benefits than they pay in taxes, and informal employment is mostly low-wage.

A thing about how Italians are not actually 3x richer than Dutch(Also Slovenians dont have 20k more in wealth than dutch per capita, that would have given it away)

&gt;Although private wealth is lower in Italy, wealth distribution is more equal; in Germany and Austria, wealth is more heavily concentrated in richer households. One of the main reasons for this is that private-property ownership plays a greater role in Italy. This has a lot to do with the relative underdevelopment of the public safety net: social and co-operative housing, which provides many people in Germany and especially in Austria with affordable housing of a reasonable size, is rare. Social housing and co-operatives do not however count as private assets, even if people there live occasionally more comfortably than in Italian condominiums of poor standard. But it remains simply wrong to say that Italians are wealthier than Germans or Austrians.

&gt; Graph: https://www.socialeurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image.png

""We may be wealthy as a country, but it is not the case for the citizens"" 

&gt;This is just wrong on every level. Take financial assets for example where Dutch have almost double the italian assets . [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_financial_assets_per_capita) 

&gt;Or disposable income where Netherlands household has 6000 dollars higher yearly disposable income than Italy [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_household_and_per_capita_income)



""but the Italian government needs to fix it's finances internally instead of expecting other nations to help them. Expecting others to pay is just selfish and isn't going to get them any support from ""frugal"" nations.""

&gt;I think that would be the best solution but we would have to dismantle euro. But, since euro is a big benefit for northern countries I doubt that will happen.

From wikipeida:
Fascism (/ˈfæʃɪzəm/) is a form of far-right, authoritarian ultranationalism[1][2] characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, as well as strong regimentation of society and of the economy[3] which came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe.[4] The first fascist movements emerged in Italy during World War I, before spreading to other European countries.[4] Opposed to liberalism, Marxism, and anarchism, fascism is placed on the far right within the traditional left–right spectrum.[4][5][6]

Strong regimentation of the economy != Communism. Fascism is about control, not redistribution.

You can definitely argue that USSR and China rapidly went from redistribution to self distribution (by the ruling class) but I’d argue the people that put in communism were using it as a vehicle to gain power from the get go. It was cold, cynical and self-serving. Even so, this is basically universally acknowledged as the problem with mass wealth redistribution. The people making the decisions send more to themselves.

All European Union countries have (had) until Jan. 1, 2003 to open up international and domestic postal markets to competition. (Privatization of the Post Office)


**Royal Mail Group plc** is the postal service and courier company in the United Kingdom, originally established in 1516. Under the Post Office Act 1969 the General Post Office was changed from a government department to a statutory corporation. The UK government initially retained a 30% stake in Royal Mail, but sold its remaining shares in 2015, ending 499 years of state ownership.


The **Deutsche Post** (DHL) is the successor to the German mail authority Deutsche Bundespost, which was privatized in 1995 and became a fully independent company in 2000.

**PostNL** In 1989, Royal PTT Netherlands was incorporated as the privatized mail provider. In 1993, mail offices were privatised, and became KPN.  KPN was listed on the stock exchange in 1994. In 1996, the Australian company TNT Ltd.  and KPN merged to form TNT Postal Group.  In May 2011, due to growing divergence of two major TNT N.V. divisions, mail and express, TNT N.V. changed its name to PostNL after demerging TNT Express

**PostNord Denmark** is the company responsible for the Danish postal service. Established in 1995 following political liberalization efforts, it has taken over the mail delivery duties of the governmental department Postvæsenet

**La Poste** is a postal service company in France, operating in Metropolitan France as of 1991

**Bpost**, also known as the Belgian Post Group, is the Belgian company responsible for the delivery of national and international mail as of 2000.   In 2017 Belgian Post Group has acquired Radial, the fulfilment company formerly known as eBay enterprise.  As of 2017 Belgian’s postal operator bpost is still pursuing its proposal for a merger with the Netherland’s PostNL

**Posten AB** In 1994, when the “Swedish Post Office” was transformed into “Posten AB”.  In 2009 it merged with PostNord 

After the establishment
of **Japan Post Group** in 2007 following privatization, the Group has increased its lineup of
services that support the lives of its customers and local communities.

It has been bothering me that Xitler (Xi Jinping) disappeared for about two weeks from the public media around the beginning of February, when it was the most dangerous time of the pandemic. People guess he was hiding in some secret military base of bunker. After that his ugly face showed up again and the propaganda “how successfully China controls the virus under the leadership of President Xi“ continued. Also, Xitler didn’t go to Wuhan until the pandemic there was completely under control in about April. Such a great leader who stayed away when people need him most and who lied to his countrymen all the time. I support anyone who's against this incompetent despot.

In addition, I would like to say “If you continue to support the CCP - FUCK YOU!”. The propaganda of CCP has extended to US definitely because of entanglement between CCP and someone in US. In China a lot of people are actually dissatisfied with CCP and Xitler, including those who entered Wuhan when Xitler was nowhere to be found.

Chunghas staff also caught it which you might've read which caused me to self-quarantine for 2 weeks).

Many Kpop idols attend shows and I've by chance seen them on the streets, attending shows or sat behind them for shows. Most of the time I don't actually go ask for photos and stuff because I'd be with a client and I am *professional*. But sometimes I just get press passes without business obligations. Baekho was at Dunhill where I had a client cancel on me but still have me RSVP'd so I was there, and we sat kind of close to one another and he was super nice, we talked and took a photo and he has the greatest smile. I saw Lisa from far, far away in Prada and she was swarmed by people. Minhyun was as Moncler and he stopped for so many photos with fans and he had glowing skin (it was at night and highkey cold AF so he kinda looked like a vampire). I was apparently eating at the same table as ONE where I didn't notice it was him lmao. We were all hiding from the heavy rain that day and I didn't realize who he was until a friend told me later. I met Jessica multiple times and everytime she was super great, and the only thing she asked was for me to take more pics of her left side instead of her right side lol.

I didn't say that, but nice try. I'm saying that history has been violent forever, all cultures have these problems, but most people who tend to bash America for her history overlook that it happened everywhere else and act like other countries are utopias where violence against other groups simply didn't happen. Pre-Columbian America is an example. Violence among tribes happened on mass scales before Columbus arrived, where's the outrage over that? Oh, wait, that's right, it's easier to be historically illiterate and woke to get fake internet points.


&gt;I get it can be emotionally distressing to talk about your ancestors in a negative light

My ancestors? Again, nice try, my ancestors are Poles and Italians. Hell, my great-great-grandfather came here and was granted his citizenship after he fought in WW1. Please, though, tell me again how it was my ancestors who did this.


&gt;you yourself have said that all history is violent, so acknowledging what has been done, who did it, and what the effects of it were, is only a logical next step.

Yes. History is violent. Cancelling all of recorded history because everyone has done something shitty to varying degrees isn't the way to go about it.



&gt;A) that series of conquests ended by the 1400s,

Okay? Recorded American history (by the Europeans, of course) didn't even begin until that time period. Fuck them for not arriving sooner, I guess? Does that mean if what they did happened earlier, it would be okay to forget about? If the Mongol conquest started later, would it be more appropriate than it is now to bring it up?


&gt;B) Because all Mongol lands since went back to their original peoples in the proceeding 600 years, due to the nature of a Mongol conquest

So I guess we'll just conveniently forget about the millions who were slaughtered and raped at his hand? It's okay, their land is back, fuck everyone who lived there though.


&gt;C) because the current issues - at least as far as East and South East Asia - largely stem from Cold War-era policies and alliances, to give a brief rundown

Okay, I didn't argue that Asian issues are directly caused by Genghis Khan's influence, but thank you for telling me what I already know.

You claim there is white privilege so please define white. Is that American white, Australian, European, British, Scottish....? Would you be referring to the white slaves of our past? What shade of ""white"" fits the bill? The ""white"" is a convenient misnomer used to sell a false truth. America is the most diverse culture on the planet and yet white always seems to be pitched as a global universal. There is certainly a long history of white controlling much of the wealth in this country but if you look closer, it's more about specific lineage than heritage. This is true in many countries no matter the ""color"" of that lineage, because the money doesn't drift far from the family line. 

Minority only exists because people refuse to stop segregating themselves as sub-cultures yet white; no matter the diversity is called a majority? So if all Spanish decent people globally, or Asian, or middle eastern etc were each to be categorized as vaguely as ""white"" is, what would the majority become? 

There are many things that need fixed in this country, but it isn't a white issue nor were the problems caused by ""white"" people. 

There is one thing I will give in to as far as ""keeping minorites down"" and that is social programs like welfare. These programs do target specific demographics, but not by color. These programs are used to keep low income, low education people dependents of the system for compliance. Sadly our past did create a reality where much of the poverty is endured by minorities, but that was not the design, merely the outcome. The system was designed to keep privilege specific to wealth, so you ""give"" just enough to keep the lowest class suppressed and obedient. You remove opportunity and replace it with sustainable dependence. You spend as much as you have to in order to keep people from gaining the chance of becoming self-sufficient. Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day, but teach a man to fish and he will not need your ""generosity"" tomorrow. The money squandered on these programs would be better served creating opportunities in areas where there is little chance of being financially independent but it serves a higher desire to keep those areas and their people suppressed with handouts. Welfare is the tool that keeps people beholden to a system designed to keep them down.

The worldwide number of recorded infections is now just over 10 million from the virus that first emerged in China late last year, with fears growing of a full-blown second wave. The rate of contagion has doubled since May 21.
One million new infections were recorded in just six days, according to AFP news agency, even as some countries loosen punishing lockdowns that have devastated their economies and thrown millions out of work.
United States, the hardest-hit country, has more than 2.5 million cases alone, and efforts to reopen the world's biggest economy have been set back by a jump in new infections in big states such as Florida and California.
President Donald Trump was under growing pressure to set an example by wearing a face mask as his health secretary warned the ""window is closing"" for the country to gain control of the situation.
The disease is also rampaging through Latin America, where Brazil alone has over 1.3 million cases.
Infections are up too in some other parts of the world that have reopened, with Europe registering a caseload of over 2.6 million, although daily rates have stabilised.
The US state of California was the latest authority to reimpose restrictions, ordering bars in Los Angeles and six other counties -- an area with 13.5 million residents -- to close because of the rising number of cases. The hardest-hit parts of the US are in the south and west, where many state leaders had pushed for early economic reopenings.
But Los Angeles, the second-largest US city, only re-opened its bars on June 19. California had already ordered some areas to reinstate stay-at-home orders, while San Francisco announced a ""pause"" in its reopening.
In Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis conceded there had been an ""explosion"" in new cases as the state notched a record 9,585 cases in 24 hours. Miami announced beaches would close over the July 4 holiday weekend and bars are also shutting their doors.
New coronavirus cases have been surging in more than half of US states, reaching record highs.
Several other countries have also imposed new restrictions to counter fresh outbreaks. China imposed a strict lockdown on nearly half a million people in a province surrounding Beijing to contain a fresh cluster.
Beijing official Xu Hejian described the situation as ""severe and complicated"".
Iran, which has struggled to curb its outbreak even as it gradually lifted restrictions from April, said it would make mask-wearing mandatory in certain areas from next week.

The only time you reduce the area under the curve is when you eradicate the disease which would, in any country with the disease, virtually require a total travel ban until the rest of the world is fixed and a 6-week lockdown with 0 exceptions. Some is only better than nothing if your hospitals are at risk of being overwhelmed which ours aren't and never were. The consequences of eradicating the disease are far, far worse than the consequences of living with it now that we're aware of its capabilities.

Just wearing masks probably isn't going to elongate the curve out until mid-2021. You'd have to take other measures.

FAQ:

**Which tools do you use?**
The background map is here: https://mapchart.net/europe-detailed.html. I did some minor changes to the boundaries (removed or added) with Paint and Photopea.
I use https://photopea.com to add the flags to the map.
Currently, most flags are from Wikipedia. I might need to use this page for some countries: https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/x-sub.html
It appears that many of you are interested in how I make this map. I might make a tutorial video at some point.

**How will you make X country?**
You will see... :-) However, I'm happy to see advice on more ""irregular"" areas.

**Wow, X country is really dense, good luck...**
I might simplify the borders if it works better. I cannot go as small as I want, as I'm limited by the resolution of the background map. Please do not have too high expectations about places with lots of subdivisions. I will simplify them, don't get disappointed.

**Why did you use the old French regions?**
Contrary to the modern regions, they (most of them) have proper flags. Also, they technically still exist as NUTS2 regions. 

**Why didn't you use provinces for Belgium?**
I use the highest-level subdivision for each country that still has flags. This means provinces for the Netherlands and regions for Belgium. Also, as far as my research went, Belgian regions are much more important than provinces.

**Why is only Kaliningrad included from Russia?**
I wanted to avoid having gaps. When I will come to Russia, I will do a federal district each day. All of Russia would be too much for a single day.

**Why did you use the unofficial flag for Scania?**
Based on my poll about French regions, you seem to prefer unofficial, but popular flags over official, but barely used flags. I stuck to your wish for Sweden as well.

**Why did you fill up the IJsselmeer?**
It was already filled on the original map from MapChart.

Nyamko Sabuni (L): Sju procent av Sveriges vuxna befolkning, över en halv miljon, utgörs av utrikes födda med risk för fattigdom.

Det är Sveriges integrationsskuld. Liberalerna presenterar i dag en plan med tydliga delmål för att minska Sveriges stora integrationsskuld. Dessutom kräver vi att svenska regeringar varje år redovisar hur stor integrationsskulden är.


Coronakrisen är en av de svåraste prövningarna för Sverige i modern tid. I dagsläget har över 5.000 människor dött och många människor har förlorat sina jobb eller sina företag.

Coronakrisens mest akuta skede ebbar ut i takt med att smittspridningens första våg nu avtar. Liberalerna har i vårt samarbete med regeringen bidragit till viktiga reformer för att rädda jobb och företag för att undvika en akut finanskris i Sverige. Men trots detta är den ekonomiska nedgången oundviklig och de strukturella problem vi såg före corona kommer att förvärras.

Redan före krisen har integrations­problemen i Sverige varit alarmerande. Alltför många människor lever i utanförskap. Mångas frihet och möjligheter är begränsade eftersom de saknar jobb och har bristande språkkunskaper. Framför allt många utrikes födda kvinnors situation är allt annat än vad vi kan förvänta oss i ett av världens mest jämställda länder. I landets utanförskapsområden är arbetslösheten mer än dubbelt så hög och andelen som lever med försörjningsstöd mer än tre gånger så hög som i övriga Sverige. Liberalerna vill vända denna utveckling.

I nya siffror från riksdagens utredningstjänst, som på Liberalernas uppdrag har bearbetat data från Eurostat, jämförs dessa 7 procent med övriga Europa. EU-snittet för utrikes födda med risk för fattigdom är 4,3 procent. 

Med coronakrisen kommer den redan höga arbetslösheten bland utrikes födda att öka. Vår misslyckade integrationspolitik, där vi öppnat dörren till Sverige som land, men inte till vårt samhälle, kommer att bli förödande. För att återstarta Sverige krävs det att Sveriges främsta prioritering i spåren av corona ska vara att lösa integrationen och vända utvecklingen i våra utsatta områden.

Vårt parti varnade tidigt för problemen: Redan år 2004 tog Liberalerna fram rapporten ”Utanförskapets karta” där en kartläggning gjordes såväl av omfattningen som av utvecklingen av utanförskapet i utsatta områden. Den illavarslande utveckling vi då larmade om har, inte minst efter flyktingkrisen, fördjupats långt mer. En ny underklass växer fram och vi ser nu, i vissa områden i Sverige, en återgång till ett Fattigsverige.

Det går inte blunda för denna utveckling. Människor som fastnar i utanförskap har begränsade möjligheter att bygga en framtid för sig och sina barn. Detta tar sig uttryck på många sätt och kräver åtgärder inom många sektorer och från en mängd ansvarstagande samhällsaktörer.

När en politik nu formuleras för att resa oss ur coronakrisen måste vi samtidigt utforma en politik som reser oss ur den integrationskris som rådde före pandemin. Integrationskrisen har byggts upp under lång tid genom att nyanlända invandrare gjorts bidragsberoende och maktlösa, ofta i utsatta och otrygga områden. Denna skuld efter politisk underlåtelse måste nu betalas av.

Sverige ska inte vara ett delat land. Vi vägrar acceptera en återgång till ett nytt Fattigsverige. Därför måste vi sätta ord på den skuld som byggts upp. Vi väljer att kalla denna skuld för integrationsskuld, inte för att det är en skuld som några enskilda bär utan för att vårt samhälle har en skuld mot alltför många enskilda.

Politiken måste under lång tid handla om vårt samhälles avgörande glapp i egenförsörjning mellan grupper. Politiken måste också komma att handla om den skuld många år av politisk bidragsmentalitet och lågt satta förväntningar på nya medborgare bidragit till att skapa. En missriktad välvilja har lämnat ett stort antal migranter utanför samhället därför att samhället inte har ställt upp med tydliga förväntningar om att också människor som har flyttat till vårt land ska kunna försörja sig själva, tala svenska och bidra till samhället. Denna skuld efter politisk underlåtelse måste nu betalas av.

Vad är det då som ska mätas? Vilken fråga ska politiker behöva svara på varje år tills integrationsskulden är avbetald? Samhällsekonomiskt fångas integrationsmisslyckandet väl av skillnaden i medianinkomst mellan utrikes födda och samhället i stort. Bakom sådana siffror döljer sig arbetsmarknadsetablering och humankapital men också pensionsutsikter, arbetsplats­gemenskap och ekonomiska möjligheter i vardagen. Räknat på detta sätt tydliggörs hur Sverige sticker ut från viktiga jämförbara länder. EU-gemensamma definitioner visar att gruppen utrikes födda med oroande låga inkomster (under 60 procent av median­inkomsten) uppgår till cirka 560.000 personer. Det motsvarar 7 procent, var femtonde person, av den totala vuxna befolkningen i Sverige. Dessa personer måste få förutsättningar att bli delaktiga och lyckas.

I nya siffror från riksdagens utredningstjänst, som på Liberalernas uppdrag har bearbetat data från Eurostat, jämförs dessa 7 procent med övriga Europa. EU-snittet för utrikes födda med risk för fattigdom är 4,3 procent. I Norge och Danmark är siffran 4,6 respektive 4,9 procent. Tyskland utmärker sig likt Sverige med ett generöst flyktingmottagande under åren runt flyktingkrisen 2015. Trots detta är motsvarande siffra i Tyskland 4 procent av befolkningen.

Ett första delmål i Sveriges integrationspolitiska arbete bör vara att upprätta en plan för att integrationsskulden ska sjunka till tyska nivåer. En sådan bör bland annat innehålla åtgärder för kunskaper i svenska språket, morötter för kvinnors deltagande i arbetslivet, åtgärder för att till exempel bekämpa hedersrelaterat våld och förtryck, förenklade villkor för små­företag och samverkan för upprustade förorter.

Vi föreslår att detta delmål ska beslutas av riksdagen och regeringar ska årligen berätta hur arbetet går. Sedan 1994 lämnar svenska regeringar årligen en fördelningspolitisk redogörelse. Liknande redogörelser görs också om jämställdhet och klimatet. Det behövs en redogörelse också för integrationen och integrationsskulden.

Liberaler ser varje människas värdighet. Det är hennes frihet och möjligheter vi slåss för. Integrationskulden innebär ett enormt svek mot varje människa som kommit till vårt land utan att ges chansen att lyckas här och mot varje enskilt barn som växer upp i utsatta områden utan förhoppningar att lyckas i skolan eller att få ett bra jobb.

Liberalerna har satt upp ett över­gripande mål: Sverige ska inte ha några utsatta stadsdelar 2030. Vi ska inte vara ett delat land med ett utanförskap som föder förakt, frustration och konflikter.

Vi löser bara detta genom att i arbetet med politiken här och nu, med coronakrisens första fas till ända, skapa nya möjligheter till klassresor.

The worst problem about the hunger games is the environment, not the players. Most people die from the environment, but some do end up dead at the start from looting.

Along with African countries (and middle eastern countries and south American) all having the skills needed to harvest whatever they need if the environment has it. The fighting aspect is more tailored towards the wildlife, the the players.

&gt;Moon made the remarks during a video conference with European Council President Charles Michel on Tuesday, saying another summit between Trump and Kim would help resume the stalled nuclear negotiations, an official at Moon's office told reporters.

&gt;""I believe there's a need for North Korea and the United States to try dialogue one more time before the U.S. presidential election,"" the official quoted Moon as saying.

US announced the decision hours after China said it would curb visas to some Americans heading to Hong Kong, itself a tit-for-tat response to a US move.
United States has been leading a global uproar over a national security law approved by China, which Hong Kong activists say would destroy the city's freedoms.
""We can no longer distinguish between the export of controlled items to Hong Kong or to mainland China,"" Pompeo said in a statement. ""We cannot risk these items falling into the hands of the People's Liberation Army, whose primary purpose is to uphold the dictatorship of the CCP by any means necessary,"" he said, referring to the Chinese Communist Party.
The State Department last year approved $2.4 million in defense sales to Hong Kong, of which $1.4 million worth were actually sent, including firearms and ammunition for law enforcement, according to official figures.
The Commerce Department simultaneously said it was revoking its special status for Hong Kong. It will now treat the financial hub the same as China for so-called dual-use exports that have both military and civilian applications -- and which are highly restricted when sought by Beijing.
China promised autonomy for Hong Kong before Britain returned the territory in 1997 but wants no repeat of massive and sometimes destructive protests that rocked the territory last year.
""It gives us no pleasure to take this action, which is a direct consequence of Beijing's decision to violate its own commitments under the UN-registered Sino-British Joint Declaration,"" Pompeo said.
President Donald Trump's administration has already declared that Hong Kong is no longer autonomous in US eyes and has been rolling out a series of measures in response. On Friday, the State Department said it was restricting visas for an unspecified number of Chinese officials seen as responsible for infringing on the autonomy of the Asian financial hub.
In response, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Monday that the US ""scheme... to obstruct the passage of the Hong Kong national security law will never prevail.""
""To target the US's above wrongful actions, China has decided to impose visa restrictions against American individuals who have behaved egregiously on matters concerning Hong Kong,"" Zhao said.
While outlawing acts of subversion, secession, terrorism and colluding with foreign forces, the legislation will allow China's security agencies to set up shop publicly in the city for the first time.
Britain, the European Union and the United Nations rights watchdog have all voiced fears the law could be used to stifle criticism of Beijing, which uses similar laws on the authoritarian mainland to crush dissent.
In Washington, some US lawmakers fear that Trump will take primarily symbolic action on Hong Kong, preferring to prioritize trade concerns that could affect his re-election campaign.
Last week, the US Senate unanimously approved a bill that would impose mandatory economic sanctions against Chinese officials, Hong Kong police -- and banks that work with them -- if they are identified as hurting the city's autonomous status.
Zhao, the foreign ministry spokesman, warned that the US ""should not review, advance or implement relevant negative bills concerning Hong Kong, even less impose so-called sanctions on China, otherwise China will firmly take strong countermeasures.""
Hong Kong was upended by seven straight months of protests last year, initially sparked by an eventually abandoned plan to allow extraditions to the mainland. But they soon morphed into a popular revolt against Beijing's rule and widespread calls for democracy.

this statement is misleading.

- Turkey

- Malaysia

- Indonesia

the following states have criticized the USA, and have not stopped criticizing USA to this day:

- turkey

- syria

- pakistan

- iran

- iraq

&gt; Turkey is a NATO ally with military bases that the US can use and stores nuclear weapons.

exactly, that's what i mean: Turkey criticizes its own allies (and not just against USA, but also against European allies). Turkey for example repeatedly threatened to unleash its Syrian refugees into Europe, unless it gets what it wants. 

with friends like that, who needs enemies? 

&gt; As mentioned the goals of several of those terror groups is to set up a caliphate in Xinjiang. This is not much different from ISIS itself. This goal necessarily involves overthrowing the CCP in Xinjiang, just like terror groups aim to overthrow the US in the mideast.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, as a theoretical aspiration, all these extremist organisations hope to overthrow every non-islamic government in the very distant future, including both the entire CCP in China and the US government. A global caliphate is the dream aspiration.

in theory yes.  but in reality: ask yourself, which country has borne the brunt of their attacks: USA or China?

It would kind of explain why the entire article is about finding a way to explain away mountains of evidence *cited in the article itself*. Stuff like:

&gt;Several neuroimaging studies investigated the functional pattern of transgenders’ brain during task performance. Berglund et al.49) found that MtF transgenders exhibited a hypothalamic activation similar to control females when smelling odorous steroids. Burke et al.50) found that adolescents with GD exhibited a hypothalamus response to androstadienone similar to their gender identity. The authors observed less clear findings in children; that is, boys with GD showed an activation pattern similar to their biological sex, while girls with GD showed a different activation pattern of the hypothalamus from controls. Ku et al.51) and Gizewski et al.52) investigated functional patterns in transgenders when watching erotic videos. They found that brain activation patterns of MtF transgenders were similar to control females. Soleman et al.53) found underactivation of the superior temporal lobe in FtM transgenders compared to control females during processing of positive affective pictures. Junger et al.54) found significant differences in the precuneus, the insula and the medial prefrontal gyrus in MtF transgenders compared to control males and females during responding to male versus female voices. The authors suggested an intermediate position between male and female for MtF transgender subjects. Schöning et al.55) reported significant differences in the left parietal and the temporal-occipital regions in MtF transgenders compared to control males when subjects performed a visuospatial task. However, Soleman et al.,56) in another study, investigated brain activation of adolescents with GD and healthy controls when performing a semantic and phonetic verbal fluency task. They did not found significant differences in neuronal activation between adolescents with and without GD. Staphorsius et al.57) also found no significant sex differences in untreated adolescents with GD when performing an executive function task.

The argument in the article you listed was basically ""sure, there are all these brain areas that do behave with consistent differences, but *other* brain areas aren't different at all!"" Which in no way negates the other findings. Do you see the difference?

Do you think the people who did take that land disappeared and left the country when it was unified under the British Empire? Modern Canada is clearly founded on the expropriation of land from the First People so to say that Canada (through it's immediate forerunners) stole that land isn't really inaccurate. Also Modern Canada didn't appear ex nihilo but itself expanded and built into formerly native lands and as you admit violated treaties (that they themselves made as the canadian government) i.e. essentially annexing sovereign land or stealing it. 

&gt;The Natives had no guns, no stone or metal architecture, and no roads that could be recognized as such.

Is this a bad thing? sure people from the modern day have a society would miss those but that's not the same as being an inherently good thing. This is hardly worth the deaths of over a million people.

&gt;Western Civilization is more than a buzzword-

It really is and an incredibly poorly defined one at that. Also the contrast between the civilised and the savage is a deeply racist one. It's also frequently ironic. What was at all civilised about the DRC under Belgium? what was civilised about the famines in india caused directly by British colonialism? what was civilised about the whole raft of genocides across the globe either committed directly by so-called ""western civilisation"" or indirectly caused by ethnic tensions stoked by empires trying to maintain control over areas they purposefully underdeveloped?

&gt;They claim Europeans committed genocide against them, but tribal warfare was by nature exterminatory and several of their practices- enslaving children, burning captives, SCALPING settlers that their tribe was opposed to, including women and children-those things are terrible, and yet you'll never hear acknowledgement of that.

Many parts of the USA are not helpful examples. Several states that re-opened bars did so with few restrictions in place - normally just something along the lines of ""we'll reduce our capacity by 25%."" Pubs in the UK will have to provide table service only, ensure tables are spaced out, and ensure people don't stand or congregate inside the venue. They have to limit their capacity such that people can stay two metres apart and they have to supervise to ensure people are doing so. Unless pubs willingly break the rules, or there's some sort of mass mutiny that pubs can't bring under control, then we really *can't* see scenes like those in the US. (As an aside, calling the people attending the bars 'knuckleheads' seems preposterous when you're not placing firm restrictions on the bars themselves. Regulate, for goodness' sake!)

Secondly, the idea that's been mentioned elsewhere, that the rest of Europe isn't a good point of comparison because ""they don't have the same drinking culture"" is a little misleading. There seems to be this peculiar notion that, everywhere else in Europe, when people go out they just sit with a glass of wine, a croissant and a novel, and head home to bed at 6:30PM.

The salary varies a lot though, and how much you have to pay in tuition too. In North America, you typically pay bigger tuition and get less salary. I believe the norm is also that you apply for the grant but not necessarily, so it can get quite hard. A PhD is there is also typically longer and has some differences like the candidacy exam (which isn't unique to North America, but I haven't yet heard of it in Europe).

The PhD salaries in Germany are decent, and the tuition is practically not there I think. In switzerland, where I am, the salary is possibly the highest in the world (think 3-4ish thousand chf per month depending on your year and whether you're saving or taking the pension). A lot of PhD students that have an MD here choose to do it alongside their residency (which is also paid), but that depends on where the position is (if you do it in the lab of a physician in a university hospital for instance).

The life of a PhD student can range from miserably depressed to very content and happy. It all depends on whether you know what you're getting into, the nature of the lab and the boss, and the nature of the project itself. All of these can be known beforehand, so it's reasonably in your control you just need to look into where you're going carefully. Here in Europe a PhD is pretty much a job, you take a few classes but basically negligible, it's mostly coming to the lab every work day and doing experiments. Sometimes there are deadlines, sometimes you chose a tough boss, etc and you end up staying late a lot and coming on weekends. You stay 3.5 to 6 years (depends on the lab, university and country), and then if you hopefully published something or two in the PhD, you defend your thesis and present your data to your committee and then they give you the green light to graduate.

That's not an incredibly unfair assumption to make on Reddit. While you're technically correct that the ""average person is Chinese or Indian,"" that's not really a useful consideration *most* of the time. 

1. They're speaking in very natural English, which means they're more likely to be from somewhere in the cultural west. Not a guarantee, but makes it more likely. 

2. Reddit's userbase is more western than Asian. As far as I know, the majority of people on Reddit are European or American. I think something close to 50% of the userbase is American. 

3. OP specifically mentioned US and UK politics. Honestly, the fact that they included the UK makes me more inclined to believe they're in the UK rather than the US, given that US politics are pretty far reaching as far as how it effects the rest of the world. 

And even ignoring all of those points, what the person you responded to said was

&gt;It doesn't really have anything to do with the day to day politics of an American unless you're bringing it up to justify war.

Which isn't really out of place given that OP themselves said

&gt;Are moderate people **in the UK and US** too hesitant to criticise the more extreme ideas of Islam?

Well, germans are relatively sensible.

Also, yes, the US is a mess. It's not the Repubs are like Hitler (that's a stretch unworthy of you. And actually not even true because economically the nazis were kind of ""socialists"" though not in a good way), and the dems went to the right of every right wing party in Europe, except when it comes to migrants (who they adore because...potential voters). In some areas the Dems now moved even to the right of the Republicans! for example they are even more hawkish than Trump and Graham! who'd have thought? they are feting now Bolton who is actually the worst man in the world in terms of blood covering hands.

There's another factor though: the Repubs still have a modicum of respect for laws that govern elections (not totally, I know). They let Trump through for example, bitching and tearing at their cloths all the way. But the Dem party is so utterly corrupt that they couldn't run a clean primary if their life depended on it. They cheated Bernie and likely who knows, even Booker, and all manner of other candidates for office for quite a while.

The Dem party is also only a pretend leftist. Economically they suck just slightly less than Repubs (talk is cheap. They love obscene defense budgets!). Plus they are completely compromised by IDPols since they think that plays to their base (no, the party big wigs don't give a hoot about people. Only about power).

So there you have it - a very conservative party on one side and very corrupt, super hawkish but socially super-liberal party on the other side.

It's just a question of which shit sandwich you want.

Plus the whole world is paying a price for America's dysfunction.

I actually see no hope other than the country undergoing a painful break-up into regions. Which conforms with my post-capitalist economic theory anyways, just that there'd be so many innocent victims!

It *is* completely at odds with the culture of Bristol. Bristol is one of the most diverse, open, liberal cities in Europe - celebrating a slaver is completely at odds with that.

The point I was trying to highlight is this:

There has been an ongoing debate *for decades* about what to do with this statue; at no point that I'm aware of has there been a vocal majority in favour of doing nothing. So, there was a consensus among the city that **something** had to be done. Whether that was a plaque, or moving the statue to a museum, it doesn't matter. The consensus was that **something** needed to happen to the statue. 

The most popular solution was to remove the statue entirely, but for some reason that was seen as controversial so in the end a compromise was agreed that a plaque should be erected (appeasing, mostly, the Society of Merchant Venturers).

The people interrupting that process were the Society of Merchant Venturers.

So you have as close to a city-wide consensus as can be that something should be done, one historical Boys' Club standing in the way, and a poll from 2014 showing that 54% of one news papers' readership was in favour of *not* dismantling the statue.

And there are a lot of downsides to national healthcare, especially in bigger countries, like the UK for example, the NHS is a total embarrassment with long waiting lines and not being able to get proper care since they have a budget they need to stick to and can't just order tests for people without being almost sure they are gonna get a diagnosis out of it.

&gt;I said this before, and I'll say it again. All this talk from the government about ""reducing reliance on China"" and their ""condemnation"" of China's actions is just that... talk. They have absolutely no intention on following through with these threats.

Sanctions is not something you can apply blindly.

China is a global powerhouse and plays a key role in many fields.  China is the 5th most important trading partner of the UK  [http://www.worldstopexports.com/united-kingdoms-top-import-partners/](http://www.worldstopexports.com/united-kingdoms-top-import-partners/) .

If sanctions start to be used you can expect a response from China and I am not sure it would be in the favor of the UK. One should also not forget that China plays a key part in western economies as it is the largest producer of manufactury goods.

Finally, let's not underestimate the big potential that the Chinese domestic market represents on the long term. It will hard to tell British companies that they must forget about selling in China because the CCP also applies sanctions in return.

Despite the oft-memed stereotype that Tumblrinas are preteens, there is a distressing amount of people your age or older on that site with the *exact* same lack of acumen you display.

&gt; I am a well educated and travelled individual. I lived in Africa for several years. I work in development cooperation (advising governments to alleviate poverty), I know these problems (and worse than in the US) from trying to solve them. I am in Palestine for several times a year, so I know structural oppression. 

And yet despite never setting foot in the United States, apparently, you feel qualified to tell us all about how bad we are, what our problems are, and how to solve them.

And how you're *so proud* of anarchists setting up miniature police states and ***doing practically every single fucking thing they claim to be protesting***.

You lost all credibility from the very first comment you made on this post, when you smugly defended the type of people who are tearing apart this society, victimizing the very people whose lives they say ""Matter."" 

Trying to tell us after the fact how you're ""qualified"" to pass judgement on American society because of all the time you spend in Africa and Palestine after the effect just isn't going to fly.

&gt; Nobody keeps ypu from celebrating. Go ahead. I dont celebrate the founding of my country myself cause it means little to me other than i am happy to live in a developed country like germany. I am not proud of my country neither the times before, nor after the world wars. Its not my accomplishments.

Well, that narrows it down further. A German. Come to think of it, not too recently there was another German that came to this sub to argue with me, with the same diction and typing style as yours. And trying to defend the wanton destruction and rioting before finally tearing the mask off, revealing himself to be a LateStageCapitalism tankie and accusing us of being ""bootlickers.""

&gt; The problem witb 4th of july is, its not a celebration of founding the country. Its a celebration of AMERICA NUMBER 1 FUCK YEAH WERE ARE THE GREATEST. 

Funny how foreigners ***always*** claim this kind of shit about displays of American patriotism. Of course, when it comes to your soccer teams, you guys look the other way....

&gt; And frankly, current events and politics dont justify that.

I currently live in North Wales, and the Welsh language is clearly very important to a lot of the people I know and work with. I've lived in Ireland, and while people generally complain about being forced to learn Irish in school, many are happy to understand it to some degree, and many do speak it fluently- especially to the west. I'm an immigrant from a small European country myself which had its language targetted during occupation, and I am glad that part of my culture is still alive. If these things matter to people, they matter to people, and that's that. How old a language is barely matters either. Languages are dynamic creatures, and how easy is it really for a modern-day English speaker to read medieval English? When students need translations, is it really even the same language? Why does it matter? Why do we preserve old English texts, read them, and have people learn the dialects to be able to keep reading them? Because it matters on a cultural level. That's it. 

If there are people around that want to preserve the language, they have every right to. Being around the folk scene a little myself, I know there are certainly people who wish some of the british dialects that have died out were still around, and that's valid to feel because these things will never come back and have been lost as they were forever. We could only make guesses to try to rebuild what's been lost when we could have attempted to preserve the languages instead.

It worked well but unfortunately he was in a situation where the cancer had been so devastating that his body could not hold up to the chemo and they had to stop it which caused the cancer to start spreading again. They suggested immunotherapy to him which is not covered for that cancer anywhere in Europe (it is in a lot of USA insurance programs though - Matts brother Mark from Demolitionranch got similar treatment I believe and was covered) and he paid over 4000 euros per treatment (every 2 weeks). It had also spread to his lungs so they had to drain the lungs from water periodically so he could breathe properly. Since he had lived in UK for a long time and had a house there he wanted to visit it to get some things done there (which included a court case against NHS). In his time there, he had to be take to hospital in ambulance because his lungs were filling up again.

&gt;This book has a lot in common with certain core elements of TheRedPill's philosophy. Namely, that men and women have biological differences, which drive conscious and unconscious differences in behavior, which in turn drive differences at a sociological scale.

Crediting The Red Pill for this philosophy is not correct. There is a whole scientific field, Evolutionary Psychology, which derives from basic Darwinian evolutionary theory, and which states exactly this. Under this view, denying the biological and behavioral differences of men and woman would be denying basic Darwinism. Seeing that you even mention it, I am a bit perplexed. Isn't that taken for granted in here?

What is the main consensus in here, in your opinion? Do you think that LWMA accepts the tenet that ""males and females are practically the same""?

&gt;There were a couple of passages that I raised an eyebrow at and wanted to see more supporting data, and a few sections where I took the provided supporting data with a heavy grain of salt though.

Yes, of course. It would take a 1000-page dissertation to *both* propose a new theory *and* fully document it. It would exhaust the reader, rather than the subject.

&gt; To me, the most interesting part was seeing a liberal version of redpill philosophy (hopefully that's a fair characterization)

Terms are under heavy interpretation, these days :) In some of Europe, *""liberal""* would not be considered ""left-wing"". Also, a lot of ""progressives"" are just a bunch of elite hypocrites. So I've taken to calling my approach ""radical humanitarian"".
 
&gt; overall I found it a thought-provoking read.

Thanks, that's what I was aiming at.

Civil partnership is simply the basic idea which says: these people represent more than the sum of two individuals, **they do stuff together and they love eachother**. Let official documents and procedures reflect that in a similar way to ""traditional"" married couples.

It is progressive because a place that didn't recognize this as a right for LGBT people, now does. It is also progressive because not having marriage for every couple, or civil partnership stems from our past centuries of history and some of the dumb ideas that we got during those times.

This change suggests a change in policy due to public perception finally catching up to what anyone that is not irrationally scared already knew.

Under the  contractual agreements, we never had any issues, apart from the times  where issues between Ukraine and Russia threatened supply for Germany.

This is formal answer. Formally you are correct, in essence, this is irrelevant which legal entity it was. Russia uses energy as a weapon and tool to achieve political goals. Thinking that Germany is some kind of exception from this rule is naive.

&gt;Funnily enough, you country does not have any issues with german  ""reliance"" on russian gas as long as the transit happens via Ukraine.

It makes it harder for Russia to  maneuver. If you have one button for all, it's harder to press it. If you have many buttons for each country, it's easier to press them individually.

In essence, Ukraine's argument isn't that different from what Germany is saying. It's in Ukraine's interest to force Russia into cooperation to achieve peace. If feeding Russia is inevitable, it should at least be done in a such a way that would make it harder for Russia to utilize this against other countries.

&gt;It  also has nothing to do with american protection. What exactly would  change about gas as a tool if american troops weren't here? Nothing. At  least not for Germany.

This isn't just about troops, but about complex of measures that grant free protection. This includes troops, NATO membership and other things that contributed greatly to success of German economy. Arguments that ""we don't have enemies, and there are no threats"" are wrong, simply because you don't have enemies and there are no threats, because you have free American protection, lose it, and you'll see the difference.

* We met when I lived in the United Kingdom, through mutual friends! He's Danish so Denmark to the UK isn't very far; he visited a bunch and we got closer. We did NOT date at this point though.

* It took eight months from when we became official to me moving overseas to Denmark!

* He is from Denmark. I am a dual national of Slovakia/Canada; I was living in Canada at the time though.

* Sorry if this is irrelevant but there was no visa process as I just exercised my EU treaty rights to move to Denmark. I booked a flight, flew here, and went to register at the office in Copenhagen that I am from the EU, I am here to live, here's my ID, here's proof I can support myself. It was all done in like half an hour LOL.

* Job hunting has been tough as I don't speak fluent Danish (been here for about one year). I did have a job but I got laid off, and now with the whole pandemic situation it's been hard to find work as lots of others are in the same boat..

* Yes, he found an apartment to rent and I moved into it with him!

* I was in Canada at this point so I just left it up to him, really. He was living at home, but found this apartment to rent. He used a well-known Danish rental site to find it and went through the whole rental/deposit process; pretty standard.

* Not really, since I've known him for four years now and we hung out a LOT/got to know each other quite slowly, and had some visits as a couple before I moved over here, we both pretty much knew what to expect. I was - and still get - a little homesick sometimes since I am here alone (family is in Slovakia/Canada), but it's nothing serious that I can't handle!

* Make sure you realise how hard it can be to relocate, and make sure your partner knows this too if you are the one moving. I've lived in many different countries in my life, but didn't really struggle with culture shock or anything until I moved here to Denmark. The language barrier is a lot harder when you're older too. I don't absorb languages as easily as I did when I was a teenager moving to Canada learning English, for example. It's taken me a lot longer to settle and become comfortable with living here, and I underestimated how homesick I could become at times!!! If your partner is moving to you from a very different country than where you live, please try to be patient with them if they struggle or don't 'get their shit together' right away. Plus you should make sure you make a decent wage and/or have a good chunk of savings, since you shouldn't expect your partner to work right away; unless of course they have a job lined up LOL, or they are fluent in the language of the country they are moving to.

Well it will reduce immigration for the lowest paid jobs... just not the overall total

Except they were already competing for good jobs with europeans. So actually the only change is removing competition for low paid jobs. Competition was always there for good jobs.

The lead make up wasn't just for their face either, some sources I've encountered over many years of finding this stuff fascinating also mention how because the aristocracy could afford copious amounts of sugar for the first time in Western European history (and it was only going to get worse from the 17th century onwards), they often had severe tooth decay and in a way this became fashionable, because tooth decay meant you were wealthy enough to afford sugar. 

So those in the upper class who could afford make up but couldn't afford a lot of sugar used yellow lead to paint their teeth to look decayed, thus creating the appearance that they could afford a high sugar diet.

Yellow lead (which is a pigment made from lead oxide and tin oxide) was used in oil paintings, and also used as a dye for pastals/candies, and to try and pass watery curdled milk off as more creamy and buttery.

&gt; AFP France&amp;#039;s armed forces ministry has provided local authorities with a guide to 100 Africans who fought for France in World War Two, so that streets and squares may be named after them.

&gt; French Junior Defence Minister Genevi&amp;egrave;ve Darrieussecq, presenting the 210-page booklet, said &amp;quot;The names, faces, lives of these African heroes must become part of our lives as free citizens, because without them we would not be free&amp;quot;.

&gt; After the Nazi invasion of France in 1940 many Africans in French colonies volunteered for Gen Charles de Gaulle&amp;#039;s Free French Forces, though many were also drafted into service.

&gt; Yeah, things went great after the French Revolution

Actually it did. It was arguably the single most transformative event of the long 19th century. The legacy of the revolution modernized France and numerous other regions across Europe.

&gt; The Petrograd Soviet and the provisional government were a lot better than the monarchy. If only the Bolsheviks hadn't kept fighting for control after that

The ProvGov was basically a phantom authority with no legitimacy. A cabal of Kadets, SRs, and Mensheviks pretty much just had Grand Duke Mikhail sign an abdication that also effectively ""transferred"" the authority of the tsar to their self-declared cabinet. They refused to consult the Duma whatsoever, and were a rival to the Petrograd Soviet only insofar as the Soviet was the de facto legislature as acknowledged by the spontaneous self-organization of the workers and soldiers.

The Soviet itself refused to take action to actually seize power for itself despite having the capabilities to do so.

The widespread ""freedom"" during this period was effectively the result of total anarchy. Neither rival organ was either willing or able to enforce any kind of stability. By October, things had degenerated to the point that many Russians were simply wishing for a restoration of order.

&gt; If the White government didn't try to keep fighting in WWI, it could have been better odds they wouldn't be overthrown by the reds

&gt; &gt; The problem was that the Prov Govt were trapped in the war by their Entente Allies. They were so stupidly indebt and their entire economy only functioned due to British loans.

&gt; &gt; Considering Lvov, Kerensky, Tsereteli and even Trotsky’s views in early-mid 1917, they could have possibly stabilised but probably as a Social-Democrat style Government

Extremely, extremely wrong. Arguably the most fatal act of the the ProvGov was attempting an *offensive* in June. This was a catastrophic failure, further radicalized the soldiers, and fatally destroyed any semblance of legitimacy the ProvGov had. This was only reversed temporarily because the Bolsheviks hesitated to seize power during the July Days, Kerensky took power, and cracked down. What remaining legitimacy Kerensky had restored was again eradicated in September due to the Kornilov Affair.

Had the ProvGov decided to engage in a purely defensive effort instead of the baffling decision to launch an offensive, things might have turned out differently. But the ProvGov was basically illegitimate and prone to endless bickering, it was highly unlikely to survive. By September the army was basically disintegrating due to mutiny and desertion. The soldiers' soviets and Petrograd Soviet had been driven into the hands of the Bolsheviks, the only faction to have indefatigably called for immediate peace and land reform throughout. The October coup merely pe-empted what would be established fact within days due to elections to the Soviet, and when the Right-SRs and Mensheviks walked out of the Congress they effectively abdicated any say in the new government. The ProvGov and the non-Bolshevik socialists destroyed themselves through countless unforced errors.

&gt; There were many bloodless revolutions in former socialist countries that resulted in much better conditions for everyone

&gt; &gt;  For former soviet satellite states yes, for former USSR countries, not quite as much

&gt; &gt; &gt; How about the Baltic countries? We are much better now than we were before.

For references to the kinds of governments that now control the Baltic states: Latvia has an annual holiday honoring Latvian Waffen-SS veterans.

&gt; I mean Hitler’s revolution was bloodless too.

The Nazis did not take power through a revolution. They took power via a backstairs conspiracy in collaboration with the conservatives and reactionaries, and then exploited the Reichstag Fire to give themselves unlimited emergency powers, rig a new election for a majority, and physically slaughter the political left. The wing of the Nazi Party that advocated a ""second revolution"" to sweep away the last vestiges of the Weimar constitution, led by the SA, was purged in the Night of Long Knives.

Would prefer some theme_bw() over the default ggplot graphs but eh that's just my taste. I'm super interested in checking out that dataset myself, though I would be surprised if I did anything greater than recreating what you did.

That being said, I wonder what a more robust data collection system could be possible that could give us a better look at the world's political views in aggregate. Like you had pointed out, there would a difference in the context between a conservative party which is trying to keep the status quo for social safety net programs in nations with little or a lot of robust programs. They don't start from a common baseline which means that by default this may push the needle further left. This may not be a bad thing to consider, but I think people could also argue that this would an example of the Overton Window for each country's political system. I think this always runs into the problem (at least I've found) on doing statistical analysis: what question are we trying to answer here, and is it the right question? Do we we want an aggregated comparison between the Democratic Party's views vs other Liberal parties in Europe? Or do we want to focus mainly on social safety net and economic policy (as many leftists seem hyper-focused on)? I don't know if the right answer is one of these things or the other, but I think the questions are healthy to ask (and I also think you address them very well in your write-up).

As well I think this model does help in telling us about individual parties and their relationship w/ each other, however I don't think it does well for telling us how left or right a nation's political system as a whole is. For example, if a nation has one consolidated conservative party and 2-4 liberal/socialist parties it may look much more left leaning; however if the conservative party is winning elections w/ 75% of the vote this would mean that the balance of power is much closer to the conservative side than looking at the parties alone would tell us. Going into this direction runs us into a couple issues. At least in the US the balance of power is very cyclical (though the raw proportions of support are much closer to 50/50), which means that simply weighting by who is in power would result in massive swings, while weighting by support may be more stable. However, the US (and many other nations) have parties which are big-tents, so changes in party-platform might capture power dynamics w/ in the party but not necessarily reflect the actual balance of political views of the nation/party. Individual-issue polling could help, but that might be extremely hard (and also very nation-specific) to implement as a system.

It seems a tough problem to solve and I don't think we should treat this as set in stone.

It has also affirmed the nation’s global primacy beyond any doubt. Fear not for your columnist’s grip on logical reasoning, at least any more than usual. These contrary claims are reconcilable.
&gt; 
&gt; The first comes from a mere glance at the facts. The US accounts for a quarter of the world’s recorded deaths from Covid-19. Its people are ignominiously barred from entry to the EU and other allied territories. Unemployment is at its highest rate for a human lifetime. The killing of George Floyd has exposed racial inequities and highlighted once more a homicide rate that marks America out among rich countries.
&gt; 
&gt; Even if the Depression was more acutely harrowing, there was no pandemic and, from 1933, people had Franklin Roosevelt to lead them, not a thrown, lost-looking Donald Trump. On that point, with the logistical test of a presidential election still ahead, the year has ample room to get worse.
&gt; 
&gt; Compounding these traumas is intense scrutiny from the rest of the world. And so to the second claim. The US is the only nation today whose domestic failings could set off vast protests in other continents. For all its heft, China does not draw young Europeans to the streets on behalf of Uighurs or the cause of democracy in Hong Kong. At least not in such awesome numbers. It took the Floyd killing at the hands of police to do that. And, while the US has botched its response to the coronavirus pandemic, other countries with dismal records (namely Britain) escape without the same volume or tenor of foreign coverage.
&gt; 
&gt; Such exposure was the price America once paid for its overwhelming superiority in economic scale and military potential. It was a tax on world leadership and, as such, eminently affordable. With China’s gains in both gross domestic product and armaments, however, even this consolation no longer applies.
&gt; 
&gt; The US, then, finds itself in the worst of all possible worlds. Its external power and internal cohesion are manifestly in decline. Its psychic hold on the rest of humanity is not. The result is a level of scrutiny that no other nation, not even the other superpower, has to experience — or, perhaps, could withstand. The tighter the inspection, the more numerous the revealed flaws, and the more compromised is America’s ability to command global deference. The whole process is viciously circular. What is a boon for a Washington correspondent — everyone, everywhere has an opinion on the US — can be a bane for Americans themselves.
&gt; 
&gt; As the tussle develops, China’s obvious advantages over the US include a four-times-larger population and a one-party system’s ability to plan long-term. But a less discussed one is the world’s lower level of obsession with it, for now. This is more often framed as a liability: a lack of soft power, of cultural magnetism, compared with the land of Netflix and all-conquering pop stars. But the corollary is greater freedom from outside invigilation.
&gt; 
&gt; A discreet rise is what China is said to have achieved over recent decades. The US is condemned to the exact opposite: to wane in public, like an actor who no longer commands the plum roles but remains hounded by paparazzi. Its crimes and mistakes are still aired like no other nation’s.
&gt; 
&gt; It was natural that America held the world rapt when that world was unipolar. That it continues to do so in 2020 needs some explaining. One reason is the country’s relative openness to media coverage. Another, reinforcing the first, is the English language: it is easier for the average European (or Australian or Nigerian) to follow US public life than China’s. Yet a third reason, it has to be said, is America’s self-image as a standard bearer for the species. Claim city-on-a-hill status, and cynics will comb the city for blemishes and signs of subsidence, even if they do so with tasteless relish or with great hypocrisy. Mr Trump, a raw nationalist, tends to avoid talk of the US as a moral experiment on behalf of mankind. His successors should retain this if no other feature of his presidency.
&gt; 
&gt; This week, the UK government named some policies after Roosevelt’s New Deal, a now almost 90-year-old programme of disputed effectiveness undertaken in different circumstances in a different continent. The way the US continues to serve as a reference point is impressive. It is a vestigial mark of its time as a truly unchallenged power. But it comes at the cost of painful exposure. The world is moving on from American hegemony. It is not moving on from the American spectacle.

nu trebuie sa faca ceva sau sa nu faca ceva.

din punctul meu de vedere este mai degraba vorba despre a oferi o sansa organizatiilor politice care vor sa reformeze administratia publica si statul roman.

iti place cum arata orasele din Romania?

iti place cum functioneaza institutiile statului roman?

ne plangem zi de zi de faptul ca  (nu) functioneaza tot si toate, insa cand avem posibilitatea sa facem o diferenta, sa participam la a produce o schimbare - asteptam politicieni mesianici, asteptam sa ne motiveze altii, asteptam sa muneasca altii

eu daca mi-as dori o schimbare in orasul meu (si chiar imi doresc) pentru ca m-am saturat de:

* lipsa de transparenta
* trafic infernal
* lipsa digitalizarii in administratia publica
* poluare fonica si poluare a aerului ingrozitoare
* lipsa de consultare publica a oamenilor si a comunitatilor
* sute si mii de arbori defrisati
* mizerie peste tot
* trotuare care au devenit parcari
* bani publici aruncati pe propaganda la televizor pentru institutii publice
* bani aruncati in televiziuni pe contracte de tip ""servicii video""
* transport in comun infect
* lipsa infrastructurii pentru transport alternativ
* lipsa spatii verzi
* lipsa de spatii culturale

as vota altceva decat a fost pana acum si a facut ca toate acestea sa se intample ani si ani de zile incat sa devina normalitate.

si mai mult, m-as implica in campania electorala pentru ca oamenii aceia sa aiba sansa de a-si atinge obiectivele si angajamentele si de a-si implementa solutiile. as vorbi cu familia, cu prietenii, as lua legatura cu echipa candidatului, m-as inscrie ca voluntar, as dori sa vad daca omul chiar este cine spune ca este si as iesi cu el pe strada.

si le-as spune ca am incredere in ei si nu o fac pentru ei, ci pentru mine, ai mei si pentru cei care vor veni dupa mine. iar daca ajung acolo si imi tradeaza increderea, nu o vor mai avea.

atat de simplu.

schimbarea se produce doar prin implicare. atat cat poate fiecare. ideea in care eu cred este voluntariat. giving back. participare la schimbare.

US announced the decision hours after China said it would curb visas to some Americans heading to Hong Kong, itself a tit-for-tat response to a US move.
United States has been leading a global uproar over a national security law approved by China, which Hong Kong activists say would destroy the city's freedoms.
""We can no longer distinguish between the export of controlled items to Hong Kong or to mainland China,"" Pompeo said in a statement. ""We cannot risk these items falling into the hands of the People's Liberation Army, whose primary purpose is to uphold the dictatorship of the CCP by any means necessary,"" he said, referring to the Chinese Communist Party.
The State Department last year approved $2.4 million in defense sales to Hong Kong, of which $1.4 million worth were actually sent, including firearms and ammunition for law enforcement, according to official figures.
The Commerce Department simultaneously said it was revoking its special status for Hong Kong. It will now treat the financial hub the same as China for so-called dual-use exports that have both military and civilian applications -- and which are highly restricted when sought by Beijing.
China promised autonomy for Hong Kong before Britain returned the territory in 1997 but wants no repeat of massive and sometimes destructive protests that rocked the territory last year.
""It gives us no pleasure to take this action, which is a direct consequence of Beijing's decision to violate its own commitments under the UN-registered Sino-British Joint Declaration,"" Pompeo said.
President Donald Trump's administration has already declared that Hong Kong is no longer autonomous in US eyes and has been rolling out a series of measures in response. On Friday, the State Department said it was restricting visas for an unspecified number of Chinese officials seen as responsible for infringing on the autonomy of the Asian financial hub.
In response, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Monday that the US ""scheme... to obstruct the passage of the Hong Kong national security law will never prevail.""
""To target the US's above wrongful actions, China has decided to impose visa restrictions against American individuals who have behaved egregiously on matters concerning Hong Kong,"" Zhao said.
While outlawing acts of subversion, secession, terrorism and colluding with foreign forces, the legislation will allow China's security agencies to set up shop publicly in the city for the first time.
Britain, the European Union and the United Nations rights watchdog have all voiced fears the law could be used to stifle criticism of Beijing, which uses similar laws on the authoritarian mainland to crush dissent.
In Washington, some US lawmakers fear that Trump will take primarily symbolic action on Hong Kong, preferring to prioritize trade concerns that could affect his re-election campaign.
Last week, the US Senate unanimously approved a bill that would impose mandatory economic sanctions against Chinese officials, Hong Kong police -- and banks that work with them -- if they are identified as hurting the city's autonomous status.
Zhao, the foreign ministry spokesman, warned that the US ""should not review, advance or implement relevant negative bills concerning Hong Kong, even less impose so-called sanctions on China, otherwise China will firmly take strong countermeasures.""
Hong Kong was upended by seven straight months of protests last year, initially sparked by an eventually abandoned plan to allow extraditions to the mainland. But they soon morphed into a popular revolt against Beijing's rule and widespread calls for democracy.

Drug use, for example, is found to be about even across \*all\* races/ethnicities, but you're far more likely to be arrested/prosecuted for a drug crime if you're BAME; if you want to start using racial stats to 'prove' crime or anything 1) you look very foolish and 2) you're going to have to get into decades of the racial context of this country. That isn't a 'fact' its a statistic that can easily be misinterpreted. Not to mention the stats you've linked are just arrests and not convictions. Again, I'm really sorry to upset your 'right is right' world-view but in reality, things are more complicated than 'this race does more crime &gt;:('

Next up; again, sorry bro but none of those things are evidence.

So, there's some actual evidence and not just some tabloid articles written \*explicitly\* to make you angry. I'd especially stop reading the Express if you do regularly as it's routinely found to be the 2nd most dishonest paper in the country.

Also I keep seeing the word 'playstation' thrown around like it's some horrendous crime to let people play a bit of FIFA in prisons, the punishment is being taken away from society, all your mates, your parents, the people you love, \*any\* opportunity to do \*anything\* outside of the prison walls. I'm not trying to make you feel bad for them because that's not the point, but this bloody stupid idea that prison needs to be dehumanising is dangerous because that's literally how you make career criminals who are incapable of doing anything that isn't crime. I know it feels good to want the bad man to have a bad time but that attitude has \*proven\* to increase the chance of people reoffending. Not that I'm saying prisons should just be rooms of lads playing PlayStation, I'd actually suggest that work or education programmes would be a far better use of their time and taxpayer money, but right now the system is just content to let prisoners loaf around all day. I'm not annoyed they've got a PlayStation but if they have time for anything more than a couple of rounds of FIFA at lunch/before bed then I'd say they need to be given more work.

And I'm sorry to break it to you, but not being near criminals \*is\* asking too much. There has never been a society in world history that has entirely eliminated crime, and there won't be until we start to address the root causes of why people turn to crime in the first place, which is wealth inequality and lots of young poor kids having fuck all to do and fuck all ways to improve their situation. You can chart, almost exactly, the closure of youth centres with the increase in knife crime over the past ten years, a significant amount of this country is \*literally\* in poverty. I don't want to get into any arguments about 'oh well being poor doesn't excuse you doing crime', no it doesn't but we have evidence from all of human history that, no matter what you threaten to do to them, when people are desperate and feel disenfranchised they are \*more likely\* to turn to crime.

I've spent a lot of time with people who've done prison for violent crimes too, I lived with some for about a year.

Unfortunately you personally being sick of the phrase 'rehabilitation' doesn't make a damn bit of difference to its necessity in the justice system. I'm also unsure why you're so dead-set on deportation as, obviously, the vast majority of prisoners are British citizens so this would be pretty ineffective. Moral panicking will not help anyone in this situation, least of all you and your family.

Also, again I think this is a statistic you're getting off dodgy newspapers, by \*no metric whatsoever\* is the UK in the top ten most dangerous places to live in Europe, this is a pure fabrication by whoever told you it. Some large cities like London or Glasgow have above-average crime rates, but the same is true for almost every other large city in the world, and as a whole, the country is \*incredibly\* safe, with crime falling year on year.

I do also, tentatively, respect your opinion that prison should be different, I think we can both agree there. Also, I'd like to express that my views don't come from sympathy for people who commit horrible crimes, or a belief that they're 'good deep down' or some rubbish; I just believe that, according to the evidence, there is \*less\* recidivism, \*less\* violence in prisons, \*less\* money spent overall on prisons and \*better\* outcomes for prisoners when a humane approach is taken.

However, **if both parties**, between now and the end of December, decide that it's in their interests to extend, **their hands are not bound.** They can amend the agreement, allowing themselves to extend until whenever they want.

It does not require the *parliaments* of every member state to ratify the change, it requires the heads of each state to agree, and then for the EU Parliament to vote - same as it did for extending Article 50.

Amending the agreement would not be subject to legal challenge, as they would not be breaking a law (or, in this case, a treaty) - they would be amending it. 

The key point is that is possible only all parties agree. The UK can't force the EU to do it, and neither could the EU force the UK to do it.

I'll counter your question by arguing that both schools actually have great layman prestige, and are indeed seen as true Ivy equivalents. I'll elaborate a bit more on NU, since that's where I graduated! (Granted, this is all going to sound biased.)

Northwestern commands a lot of respect regionally in the Midwest, and pockets across the country (for some random reason, I know a lot of people from Florida who think very highly of Northwestern). For traditional prestige industries, Northwestern places less emphasis on finance/banking, but is neck-and-neck with HYPMS for consulting, where it shines. It was also one of three schools that the Ivy League seriously considered adding when it was thinking of expanding in the '80s, so its prestige isn't some recent phenomenon.

The really interesting thing about Northwestern is that because it's so well-rounded, it's independently famous for a really wide variety of reasons depending on what angle you're coming at it from. I've met people whose only perception of Northwestern was ""a good engineering school."" Among college football fans nationwide, Northwestern is grouped with Stanford and Duke for being the ""brainy"" D1 private schools. I've had conversations with people from East Asia and Europe in the marketing industry who were really impressed by Northwestern, where it's known as a huge marketing school. In the U.S., it's been known as a preferred training ground for Hollywood's elite for generations, thanks to its theater and comms program. And of course, perhaps its most legendary program is journalism, where it's often considered tops across the board.

This is all to say that Northwestern's prestige is *inconsistent*, with variable name recognition determined across different fields and geographic areas (you could maybe argue this is the case for any elite university outside of Harvard). I actually don't think it's a weakness, and is one of the things that stands out about Northwestern. I also sort of like that Northwestern typically *isn't* the type of school that elicits a huge response, either negative or positive. I have friends who went to Harvard who have the most uncomfortable relationship with their school name. The people who know Northwestern know about it, and the people who matter (like academics and employers) definitely know about it.

Finally, I think Northwestern is one of the few top schools that will continue to see some really positive momentum. It has the right mix of old-school prestige, an established engineering school, forward-thinking investments in STEM, a relative lack of pretentiousness compared to its peers, and a sports program that's now known as having the best academics for athlete-graduates.",True,False,False,,,,0,1593702007,,False,0,{},fwpbd9q,False,t3_hjwwgz,False,False,t3_hjwwgz,/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/hjwwgz/thoughts_on_northwestern_and_jhu/fwpbd9q/,False,,1602281095,8,True,False,ApplyingToCollege,t5_2y2r8,r/ApplyingToCollege,public,,0,[],

&gt; The latest negotiations in Brussels on an EU-UK trade and security deal have broken up early, with the EU&amp;#039;s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, complaining of a lack of respect and engagement by the British government.

&gt; The two sides ended the week&amp;#039;s talks - the first held in person since February - a day ahead of the jointly agreed schedule amid evident frustration at the lack of progress in bridging what both Barnier and his UK counterpart, David Frost, described as &amp;quot;Serious&amp;quot; disagreements.

&gt; A row continues over the failure of both sides to provide &amp;quot;Equivalence&amp;quot; judgements by the end of June to allow financial service operators to continue to work across the UK and the EU. Last year, it had been agreed that decisions on the equivalence of the two sides&amp;#039; regulatory regimes should be completed by 1 July.

Are they? Are they fighting for, let's say, Muslim people who suffer from racism in Europe?

They are not. And that's fine, it's a movment that originated on the US and that fights against racism in the US, a country where black people is the main group suffering from racism. But there are other minorities, and BLM, as seen by something as obvious as the name being ""*Black* Lives Matter"", is not about fighting for the minorities, but about the lives of black people killed by police brutality. A kind of police brutality that is unheard of in Europe.

Other minorities do not feel represented by BLM because what they are fighting for is an issue that doesn't even exist outside of the US. Even the most racist of european police officers will not dare shooting or killing an unarmed man here. The worst thing they'll do is assume you're on the country illegaly and demand you to show the residence permission. That's it. Police is civilized and follows the law outside of the US.

&gt;It is proven that police view Black and brown men as more of a threat than they would a white man.

Fully true, *on the US*, which is not the entire world. Police has far better filters to keep brainless people away from the badge and far better training on civilized countries.

You see. And here lies the problem

&gt;You can show me as many Yaxley propaganda videos you like I don't believe a word that comes out of his mouth.

The problem being that you so strongly oppose a man and everything related to him without knowing anything about what he is actually trying to do. You've gone into this topic with such strong beliefs that him and his message is worth opposing that you haven't stopped to learn what it is you're fighting against.

I don't believe everything he says. I routinely fact check everything I read or hear, especially from him, before I form an opinion backed with enough evidence to back it up before I voice them. Before I attack them and before I defend them.  You? You don't even know what he says. You've been told how to feel about him and that you should oppose him by third parties. You feel like you're doing good by opposing a fascist monster and the only justification you need for it being the right thing to do is is a nod of approval from your peers.. who are all just as clueless. 

What you are opposing doesn't exist. You're fighting a fictional character and it's fictional  agenda. 

If you spent the time you have posting this nonsense in this sub learning about the persons motives and reasonings that this character was loosely based on you'd probably have something worthwhile to say by now.

We rented a car, which was really reasonable. Gas is not, but you most likely would get a car with good mileage.

Even Zurich is really beautiful and you can see the mountains from there. I totally recommend it, but also try to get out to the mountains. It's a tiny country.

Greenland doesn't even have a population of 100k, so I'd say it's not relevant to consider for such a statistic. I'd say that statistic indicates that the US have a homicide problem though.

A better statistic would be the comparison of homicide rates in US states that have liberal gun laws vs. those who haven't. I couldn't find it now but I know it exists since I've seen it. I believe the takeaway was that in states that heavily restrict gun ownership, the ratio of illegally obtained guns used in crimes was higher. And since you can just buy a gun in one state and carry it to another, that makes sense to me.

The main problem I see in the discussion of gun violence in the US is that the key question is never answered - how do you protect a society that's already full of guns if you start by taking away those that are legally obtained? European countries don't have those problems. But then, European countries have different histories, are often less rural and in general can't be compared to the US in that aspect.

&gt; Ok and? I should disarm my self because another country does not have as many guns?

That's just a stupid conclusion of somebody who think that cure A might work for illness B. Disarming in the US makes zero sense, just as arming the general population in Europe doesn't make sense.

 A reunião marcou também a primeira vez em que os presidentes de Brasil, Jair Bolsonaro, e Argentina, Alberto Fernández, encontram-se, ainda que de modo virtual.

 Ambos os mandatários haviam [trocado farpas](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/10/bolsonaro-lamenta-eleicao-de-fernandez-e-diz-que-nao-vai-cumprimentar-argentino.shtml) durante a campanha eleitoral argentina, no ano passado, quando Bolsonaro apoiou o então presidente Mauricio Macri.

 O líder brasileiro [não foi à posse de Fernández](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/12/bolsonaro-decide-enviar-mourao-a-posse-de-fernandez-na-argentina.shtml) e, mesmo após mais de seis meses de mandato do argentino, não manteve diálogo direto com o chefe de Estado do vizinho mais importante do Brasil.

 Durante a cúpula, enquanto Bolsonaro apenas mencionou as dificuldades criadas pela crise da Covid-19, o tema foi o principal assunto tratado por Fernández.

 Bolsonaro leu seu discurso acompanhado do chanceler Ernesto Araújo e do ministro da economia, Paulo Guedes. Nele, reforçou que o Brasil estava avançando nas reformas para atrair investimentos e disse que a da Previdência havia sido uma ""conquista histórica"".

  Também afirmou que instruiu membros do governo a ""[desfazer opiniões distorcidas sobre o Brasil](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/05/imagem-de-bolsonaro-derrete-no-exterior-e-mundo-teme-brasil.shtml)"" no exterior, elogiou a liderança temporária do bloco pelo Paraguai e desejou sorte a Luis Lacalle Pou. O presidente uruguaio, que [assumiu o cargo em março](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/02/lacalle-pou-assume-no-uruguai-com-457-projetos-de-mudanca-na-constituicao.shtml), estreou em reuniões do Mercosul.

 Bolsonaro encerrou dizendo que espera que a [Venezuela](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/especial/2018/venezuela/) ""retome o caminho da liberdade"".

 Já Alberto Fernández discursou da sala de audiências virtuais montada na residência de Olivos, em Buenos Aires. Ele está confinado no local devido a recomendações médicas após pessoas próximas a ele terem contraído o coronavírus.

 Durante sua fala, tratou basicamente da pandemia e da ideia de que ""é preciso reforçar a ideia da América Latina como um só país, como foi a ideia de [Simón] Bolívar e de [José de] San Martín"", heróis da independência de diversos países hispano-americanos.

 Também afirmou que o coronavírus ""derrubou tudo, apareceu de repente e revirou o mundo"", enfatizando que a [crise econômica](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/04/maior-mercado-popular-da-america-latina-tem-30-mil-familias-sem-trabalho.shtml) que virá depois não será apenas da Argentina, mas de todo o bloco. ""A crise que virá será mundial e de dimensões nunca vistas.""

 Por isso, argumenta, a integração regional deveria colocar o foco na eliminação das ""arestas"" entre as relações dos governos.

 ""A reunião do Mercosul é uma reunião dos nossos povos, isso deve ser colocado adiante daqueles que governam hoje"", pedindo que a questão ideológica ficasse num segundo plano nas discussões.

 Fernández também evocou o espírito da fundação do bloco, ""um esforço original dos ex-presidentes Raúl Alfonsín [Argentina] e José Sarney [Brasil], depois acompanhado pelo Uruguai e o Paraguai"".

 Nesta parte da cúpula, de apresentações iniciais, cada chefe de Estado discursa sem interrupções. Por isso, não houve interação entre os líderes argentino e brasileiro.

 Fernández, no entanto, chamou o presidente do Paraguai de ""meu querido Marito"" e, ao se dirigir ao do Uruguai, mencionou que conhece a família de Lacalle Pou ""há muitos anos"". Nada disse sobre Bolsonaro.

 Ambos só mencionaram o nome um do outro ao darem ""bom dia"" aos presentes: além de Bolsonaro, Fernandez, Lacalle Pou e Abdo Benítez, compareceram o presidente da Colômbia, Iván Duque, o chefe da diplomacia da União Europeia, Josep Borell, e a presidente interina da Bolívia, Jeanine Añez, todos convidados.

 Abdo Benítez, presidente do Paraguai, discursou sobre o coronavírus com dramaticidade, dizendo que a pandemia era um ""flagelo"" para a região e que seria necessária uma ""plena integração regional para reativar nossas economias"".

 Deu como bom exemplo a integração da indústrias automobilísticas e o aumento do comércio digital.

 Já o uruguaio Lacalle Pou, em sua intervenção de estreia, disse que ""não podemos ser 'mercopessimistas' nem 'merco-otimistas', e sim 'mercorrealistas'"", e que uma das prioridades seria afinar as discordâncias surgidas nos debates sobre o [acordo do bloco com a União Europeia](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/06/ue-poe-acordo-com-mercosul-na-geladeira-a-espera-de-melhor-momento-diz-consultoria.shtml).

 Depois das falas iniciais, os presidentes passaram a uma reunião interna, à qual a imprensa não teve acesso.

 Nos últimos seis meses, o bloco esteve em segundo plano, uma vez que a pandemia do coronavírus se impôs como preocupação regional.

 Assim, a Argentina também anunciou, no fim de abril, que [se afastaria de ""novas negociações"" do bloco com outros países](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/04/argentina-suspende-participacao-no-mercosul.shtml), e a gestão de Fernández colocou ressalvas no acordo assinado, mas ainda não aprovado, do Mercosul com a União Europeia.

 Na abertura da cúpula, na quarta-feira (1º), o chanceler argentino, Felipe Solá, reforçou que essa posição não significa a saída da Argentina do Mercosul, mas que o país apenas será mais exigente sobre os impactos de novos possíveis pactos.

 O Uruguai assume a presidência do bloco depois de uma [crise interna na cúpula do governo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/07/chanceler-uruguaio-renuncia-em-reuniao-do-mercosul.shtml), iniciada há algumas semanas, quando o ministro das Relações Exteriores do país, Ernesto Talvi, recebeu a informação de Lacalle Pou de que seria afastado do cargo.

 Na reunião dos chanceleres, na quarta, Talvi postou sua carta de demissão nas redes sociais.

 Membro do Partido Colorado e ex-candidato a presidente, ele vinha enfrentando diferenças em relação a Lacalle Pou, do Partido Nacional. Talvi tem intenção de presidir a legenda da qual faz parte, e isso seria impossível à frente do Ministério das Relações Exteriores.

 Sua gestão como chanceler, porém, foi muito elogiada, por conta da repatriação exitosa de uruguaios no exterior durante a pandemia do coronavírus e no trato com estrangeiros que estiveram inicialmente impedidos de desembarcar de cruzeiros no porto de Montevidéu.

1) The value of the US dollar is backed my military power. 

2) US does not have conscription like in Vietnam war. 

3) To funnel people into the army you therefore need economic inequality to limit their options (either be homeless or join up).

4) This requirement for inequality is achieved with neoliberal economic policies that leave individuals to fend for themselves, and it is not possible to provide collective solutions to large scale problems in society.

5) Defeating the virus requires a collective solution and planing and is not possible in the current ideological situation.

6) Therefore, the US status as an empire, makes incapable of dealing with the virus like other European countries.

**2nd Mechanized Squadron Werewolf Recruitment Post**

Who are we?

2nd Mechanized Squadron ""Werewolf"" was founded in late October 2019. We are focused around a fictional Mechanized Squadron that is part of the 1st EU-Battlegroup ""Europa"". We have members from all around the globe, but most members are from various European countries (Norway, UK, Netherlands, Belgium, US, Germany etc).

What do we do?

We host missions twice a week (Fridays and Saturdays) at 19:00 GMT +1, where we run story driven campaigns that span multiple missions. Our campaigns usually have in depth briefings and backstories such that the members in our community feel immersed in the current AO. These missions are also hosted by our zeuses that make these missions all the more immersive.

What’s special about us?

Our Unique fictional Universe is something we pride ourselves in having. We also have small scale but intimate operations where every player has their own moments that have impacts on the missions outcome. And lastly, we would say that we are very community focused. Everything that we do is for the better of the community. almost all our decisions are put through a vote before being decided upon. This makes for a more democratic system where people can bring forth suggestions and makes sure everyone’s interests get a fair chance at being represented

&gt; If you WOULD want to reach carbon goals by 2030, then doing nothing, or even increasing carbon emissions, then hoping that in 2030 you will suddenly stop using coal fired plants is delusional at best.
It also doesn't take into account the not insignificant fact that the emissions you create until 2030 are pretty significant.

Goal is to move to renewables, which is why our government invests heavily into hydrogen as energy storage. A plan would be to cooperate with e.g. Marocco to produce large amount of solar energy, and then use pipelines etc. to transport hydrogen to Europe.

&gt;Using nuclear (before you demolish powerplants) is carbon free as soons as you start to use it.
It costs more than coal fired plants in the first years, as you need to pay back the interests on the large costs (compared to conventional powerplants).
All that being said, cost is in money, not in CO2 emissions.

Nuclear isn't carbon free as soon as you start using it. Construction work and all the resources that go into it is a huge initial carbon investment. Way better than coal still, but not necessarily better than renewables. Again, I am not arguing for coal here. I am on your side: Nuclear is way better than coal and our government did a mistake in not building new nuclear plants decades ago to be able to phase out coal sooner. But now we need a quite drastic, immediate effect. And renewables can get that effect quicker than nuclear plants, which likely wouldn't even be finished by the time 2030 hits

&gt;With a strong space lift infrastructure, its not exactly hard to go with the solar shades approach, in fact it can be cheaper, than phasing out fossile fuels.

The City exists because it offers a perfect regulatory-capture environment for a large segment of the international financial services sector, including an unusually close relationship between that sector, the central bank, and the local government. These things do not exist in Europe partly because of London sucking the oxygen out, but partly because most European governments are not capable of tolerating that sort of policy - they have socialists in them on a regular basis, and those socialists will (wisely) ensure that one sector does not come to dominate the economy and the development of society in the way that it has done in the financialisation of the UK. As such, the traditional approach of international capital - that is, regulatory arbitrage - will continue; with most participants structuring their affairs in ways that allow them maximum opportunity with minimum regulation. The departure of the UK from Europe means that it will not be a 'gateway to the Eurozone' as it was (as passporting will cease) and so some capital will invariably leave - but (and this is the important bit) it will not leave for Frankfurt, Dublin and Marseilles except where it is *absolutely* necessary to become subject to additional regulation.

Other than a specific bike... A folding bike with a 20"" or 16"" wheel and a geared hub motor could help with those hills. The smaller wheels actually get a little bit more torque to the road out of hub motors which can help with the hills on a commute. Not to mention they can be nimble little bikes when it comes to traffic. Downside to a small wheeled bike and/or geared hub motors (instead of direct hub motors) is that the top speed they can assist with is lower. In the EU with the low speed limit that isn't a big deal. Not sure on UK limits.

Doesn't sound like you need a fat tire version for off-road use.

American/New World slavery was definitely uniquely brutal in terms of it's generational effect and emphasis on racism. But having done some reading into history, I discovered some things that I didn't learn in all my years of public school history classes, or at least not nearly as much as I should've. Slavery was a very extensive institution, that every race participated in in some form, enslaving war prisoners, criminals, etc. But also, white people have been enslaved in the Islamic world for a very long time, and pirate raids by corsairs in North Africa would raid European ships and coastal villages taking their Christian prisoners to be ransomed for money called tribute or even enslaving them, subjecting them to harsh labor and treatment. Even US ships would be attacked, prompting the Barbary Wars(To the shores of Tripoli!) The Arab Slave Trade is said to have gone on longer and include a greater sum of Africans than the Atlantic trade, and the common practice of Arabs castrating their slaves led to extremely high mortality rates, among other harsh treatment. And slavery is unfortunately still common to this day in many countries.




Aside from that, the Middle East of course has quite the bit of human rights issues with regards to LGBT and women's rights, with some even trying to escape persecution or even death. And during the 2nd World War, Japan well...was basically a dick to it's neighboring Asian nations, what with the Rape Of Nanking massacre, ''comfort women'' service, and their overall subjugation of their neighbors, which apparently still fuels animosity among the older generations and [Japan can still be not-so-apologetic about it.](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/05/29/tokyo-keeps-defending-world-war-ii-atrocities/)

Canada has more-successfully implemented Trump's proposed strategy of limited testing.

Canada has tested around half as many as the US, per capita, and despite that, their two most-populous provinces have been hit just as hard as most US states.  Imagine what the real numbers could be, if they were to test as much as the US is.

&gt;Lets be honest. The US has done an absolutely horrendous job at dealong with this

And Canada has done slightly better, at best, mostly due to there simply not being very many Canadians.  That's my point.  If there were 330M Canadians, the virus would spread among them just as it has in the US.

&gt;Ontario would be the the 5th largest in population if it was a state, however would be the 23rd most infected state. Now you want to use testing, it woild be the 5th most tested state which lines up well with being the 5th largest state.

Ontario would also be the 40th densest US State.  You cannot directly compare testing numbers between the two countries, since as I already explained, the US does not count tests administered at private facilities, while Canada does.  In reality, Ontario is less-tested than many, if not most, US States.

&gt;Now you wanted to go after Quebec, which has handled this as poor as america for the most part. However if we compare it to somewhere of comparable sizes... lets say, Arizona. Its doing very well.

Population density is a lot more important than gross population.  That said, Arizona has half the deaths that Montreal alone does.   Quebec has over triple the deaths that Arizona does.  Your claim is found to be ridiculous.   Do not waste my time with this nonsense.

Firstly, the people condemned as ‘cucks’ and ‘libs’ are mostly pretty staunchly right of centre by the standard of most Western Liberal Democracies.

Then you have the absurdity of a fairly blue-collar base clamouring for the primacy of a government that champions the causes of big business rather than of their workers. 

This base contents itself with miserly wage rates, low holiday / paternity / maternity entitlements and expensive healthcare. It swallows the age-old lie that business ‘can’t sustain’ those policies.

Did you know the UK spends less per person in tax to pay for universal healthcare than the US does? Yep. It’s true - and yet you don’t have universal healthcare. Because the medicine and pharmaceutical industry pay a heck of a lot of money in bribes (they call it ‘lobbying’ but no other country allows corporate bribery on the same scale).

Same with the armaments industry. The NRA ‘lobbies’ the Senate and  markets guns as ‘freedom’ somehow, and people lap it up. That’s how the arms industry bribes its way to keep a huge, lucrative domestic market open.

Same with the Covid response. Elsewhere, people are put first. Americans are told business can’t afford that! They literally demand that you sacrifice your grandparents to keep the cash flowing and the profits piling up. And people buy into it! They refuse to wear masks, they equate safety measures to ‘government intrusion’ ‘liberal agenda’... 

It’s like an enormous cultural delusion. 

It’s more efficient for corporations to bribe, dupe and steal from the population and con them with right-wing propaganda than it is to behave ethically. And it’s worked. 

People like this actually think ‘the mainstream media’ and independent international media agencies are ‘fake news’ while the Fox Media group is a beacon of truth and human dignity.

No, generally evocative practices are not part of the belief. 

&gt; Is there anything analogous to siddhis in Shinto?

We have mediums which factor into certain sects strongly. You'd need to ask someone like ""livingwithkami"" or on /r/Konkokyo for more information, it isn't a practice I'm overly familiar with. 

&gt; Are all kami good people, or do they have a variety of personalities? 

Kami exist across the moral spectrum, much like Roman or Greek gods.

&gt; Do kami have their own society, government, etc., or do they just hang out alone and do whatever they want?

They're not humans, so no. Amaterasu is said to be the chieftain of the Amatsukami, but that's not to say she's superior to them. In fact there were kami who lived much earlier than her who simply declined the role. They're moreorless gods, that's what the term kami encompasses (gods and spirits both)

&gt; Do kami have jobs, like perhaps the job of a forest kami is to keep the forest healthy?

Not exactly. Kami arise as a result of natural objects, animals and phenomena in the environment and can through a form of apotheosis become kami. However, I generally only apply the term kami to those originating from Japan. I certainly don't worship those in my area of the US because not only are there precedents against this, but in my view I would be worshiping the gods of Native American religions in a manner they never agreed to. Same if I was from Europe. I disagree with enshrinement of ""local kami"" for this reason.
