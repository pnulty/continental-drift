&gt; 3.29 The UK has a long tradition of open capital markets’ policies. As noted in Chapter One,
the UK removed all exchange controls in 1979, a full 15 years before Article 63 TFEU
prohibited restrictions on the Free Movement of Capital and on payments within the EU.
As a result, the impact of the TFEU on the UK’s domestic capital policies has been limited,
and so the development of the Free Movement of Capital largely relates to the opening up
of national markets in other Member States to competition.
&gt; 
&gt; 3.63 Given the global nature of financial markets and the international framework which
&gt; establishes overarching standards for financial services regulation, some stakeholders
&gt; considered how different rules would be in the UK if they were not subject to EU
&gt; legislation.

&gt; 3.64 Stakeholders generally regarded the UK as having strong influence and representation
&gt; at the global-level bodies. For instance, the BBA commented that, ‘The UK... maintains a
&gt; leading voice in [international fora] discussions and it can therefore be argued that the UK
&gt; has materially shaped the parameters of debate before the EU implementation process
&gt; begins and remains well placed to continue to shape EU policy-making’. Evidence from
&gt; Sharon Bowles MEP noted that, ‘International level agreements often suit the UK well due
&gt; to UK engagement at the international level and the fact that international standards setters
&gt; are focussed on larger and systemic financial entities that correlates to the structure of
&gt; much of the UK financial sector’.

&gt; 3.65 On the basis that the global level is responsible for the high-level standards which set
&gt; the direction for and shape of EU legislation and that the UK was considered influential
&gt; at the global level, some stakeholders held the view that UK financial services regulation
&gt; would not necessarily be particularly different from current rules if it was not subject to
&gt; EU legislation. The extent to which UK rules would be expected to diverge from EU rules
&gt; should, however, be considered in light of the extent to which the EU is considered to have
&gt; departed from international standards.

&gt; 3.66 Evidence from Lloyd’s of London noted that, ‘UK prudential insurance regulation would not
&gt; be very different if the UK was solely responsible for the rules’. In the banking sector, the
&gt; BBA and RBS similarly considered that UK regulation would not necessarily be particularly
&gt; different, given the UK’s commitment to global standards. They did, however, highlight
&gt; that if the UK had sole responsibility then implementation of rules may be swifter, as would
&gt; be expected if only one Member State needed to agree the rules compared to 28. This
&gt; could make it easier to undertake equivalence assessments and agree access with other
&gt; non-EU countries as well as reduce the scope for fragmentation and arbitrage.

&gt; 3.67 Others argued that the UK’s ability to take advantage of greater flexibility in considering
&gt; specific national characteristics when applying the rules would create some further
&gt; benefits, especially in more domestic and local markets such as the retail financial services
&gt; sector. The British Private Equity &amp; Venture Capital Association (BVCA) suggested that,
&gt; given sole responsibility, the UK would take forward processes that are more ‘evidence-based and principles focused [...] in contrast to the EU’s “rules-based” approach’.

&gt; 3.68 A number of stakeholders noted that in some cases, and based on past experience, UK
&gt; rules may be tougher than EU regulation. The IRSG referred to the UK’s influence in the
&gt; G20 and suggested that, ‘Undoubtedly, there are some areas of EU rules where the UK
&gt; would have taken a different approach. However, there are many examples where the UK
&gt; would have taken a tougher stance’, noting as an example, the structural banking reforms
&gt; in the Financial Services (Banking Reform ) Act 2013 compared to current European
&gt; proposals.

A concept like Kungfu changed over time and also its understanding differs from people to people. I am not sure when this word invented in Chinese but suppose not far from today. Kungfu, in Chinese it literally means hard training or hard study. For example, 'you can polish a rod to a needle if you kungfu is enough'. It actually means nothin another about combat. The traditional kickboxing named Wushu which technically means 'the knowledge of fighting'. In the ancient world, combat skills were indeed used to fight but not for TV or movie show. So it is real but not fantasy while it was nothing different from the skills which used in Europe. But I do know some fantasy fiction was written hundred or thousand years ago that recorded some kungfu expert who can do something incredible like keep running 400 miles overnight,   too fast to kill a person but not being seen by others, etc. While most people understand these are fantasy but not real. It is said the word Kungfu got popular at the end of 19 century which transferred to the western world by missionaries who learned about some tales and fantasies from some local Chinese person(fantasies are always popular especially from a remote country) then western people started to believe Kungfu is something mysterious and powerful. From the 1960s, movies and TV show became widespread and made up a lot of Kungfu scenes which actually made by filming skills but not fighting skills. People took it in. The word Kungfu was then a terminology of mysterious, ancient Chinese invention that can defeat or kill people in an unbelievable way.

I've purchased 50+ products from Aliexpress but most of them have been under €30 and I would not recommend purchasing expensive products. This is why:

First, there is an 18% tax for products over a certain price. You could ask the seller to write a lower price to avoid taxes but that requires breaking the law and most reputable sellers will probably refuse to do so.

Second, there's the warranty issues. The phone might have warranty but what if it breaks? You'd have to send the phone back to China and most probably have to pay the shipping, then you'd have to wait 4-7 months for it to get back.

There's also the stuff that others have mentioned, the 3+ months wait time due to covid and the components made for asian/global market rather than European one which might cause connectivity problems. 

Also, I want to point out that buying phones from Telekom or A1 is only worth it if you sign a postpaid contract and get a good discount, otherwise they are waaay too overpriced. Your best option is to buy from Ledikom or any other reseller. If you're talking about the Xiaomi Note 10 Lite, it's 24k on Anhoch and Neptun.

[https://www.lightreading.com/cable-video/docsis/cable-upstream-growth-went-bonkers-during-early-stages-of-pandemic-andndash-commscope/d/d-id/759279](https://www.lightreading.com/cable-video/docsis/cable-upstream-growth-went-bonkers-during-early-stages-of-pandemic-andndash-commscope/d/d-id/759279) (""Cable upstream growth went 'bonkers' during early stages of pandemic – CommScope"")

&gt;According to data generated from some of CommScope's cable operator  customers around the globe, upstream usage surged in March when  stay-at-home orders became more prevalent. Specifically, upstream usage  during midday hours grew between 30% for some operators and an  astounding 150% for one European-based operator. Plus, during normal  busy primetime hours, upstream demand climbed 20% to 50%.  
&gt;  
&gt;But rather than peaking at night as in pre-COVID-19 times, the upstream  peak now resembles a long, flat curve, starting at 7 a.m. and running  till midnight, according to CommScope's data. ""The upstream was sorta  going bonkers through the whole day like that,"" Cloonan observed.  
&gt;  
&gt;Downstream usage also climbed during this period, but the overall rise  in peak demands put much more pressure on the available upstream  overhead. That's mostly due to the asymmetric nature of the HFC network,  as much more spectrum is currently dedicated to downstream traffic than  the upstream....  
&gt;  
&gt;Possible moves could include a ""mid-split"" that raises the upstream to  85MHz (up from today's 42MHz on most North American DOCSIS networks) or a  ""high-split"" that lifts the ceiling to 204MHz. In tandem, cable  operators could also beef up the spectrum available for the downstream  by upgrading the netwok to 1.2GHz using today's DOCSIS 3.1  technologies, and use that as a stepping stone toward an expansion to  1.8GHz and DOCSIS 4.0.

So, clearly, downstream capacity may have been adequate, but upstream capacity frequently wasn't.

Google the hell out of things in NY until you find one thing that kind of matches.  Ignore anything that doesn't match at all, and with anything that doesn't really match, just declare that you 'need to use your imagination'.  The farther the stretch, the better.  Preiss wasn't really all that imaginative at all in the solved puzzles, he was actually kind of simple and straightforward and prosaic, so he must have *really* gone off the wall in the other ones.

Google Satellite View is your friend.  Use it to find anything that looks remotely like anything in the paintings.  Use red lines in MS Paint to point out how a street looks exactly like the nose of the woman in the painting.  There is only one street in the world that has a turn that kind of looks like a nose.

Google in general is your friend.  If you find that a house was once owned by a man who, in the 1890s once paid the ship fare of a man to come from Europe to the United States to work in a circus, and the man was a circus freak who was abnormally tall and was older and had grey hair, you've probably found the 'gray giant'.  Don't wonder how anybody would have ever found this in the 1980s without spending years in historical societies and libraries and a hell of a lot of luck.

Use capitalization any way you  like.  If a capitalization meaning a proper noun/name is in the verse and it fits your solve, it's a proper noun.  If the next capitalization doesn't fit your solve, just say Preiss was 'being poetic' and ignore it.

Think in isolation.  Don't look at all the 12 verse/images and think about which ones were already solved and such.  Don't think about how one of them has to be Canada, and there are so few left that could be Canada.  If something 'speaks to you', **it's probably right**, even if you can't justify it all that much.  If you think one of the pairs is assigned incorrectly, and it's actually Rochester, NY or Reno, NV, you *are* most likely correct.  Go with your gut.

Think the only way all 12 haven't been found is because we haven't googled enough.  Ignore the fact that the Chicago casque was only found after Preiss sent the two guys that knew the location a photo of the exact dig location.  Or that the Cleveland casque was narrowed down to a specific planter, and they still had to dig and dig for hours  to find it.  Ignore the fact that burying the casques was kind of a bad idea and even if you know the location it's tough to do.

He shunned reading books and playing board games, opting instead to ride his bike, to swim in the pool, to play football. He dashed everywhere he went, his exhausted parents trailing behind, rather than walk sedately like most boys.

When he was six, his parents let him join the local rugby team, and training tired him out enough to let them take a break, but he still never stood still, until he was eleven and visited his school library.

He pulled a book from the shelf, and was curious. When forced to, he read in a rushed, haphazard manner, but this book intrigued him and so he sat down in one of the hard chairs and read. Engrossed in the book, his world dwindled to that single point, and three hours later he looked up from the final page of the novel to find that it was still 12:28, and the rest of the library was slowly moving back into motion.

Amazed, he pulled another book at random from the shelf, and started reading it. Focused on what was happening around him, and not the book, time moved mostly normally, but the strange spluttering was enough for him to realize what was happening.

Time passed, and the boy slowly gained a stronger understanding of this strange phenomenon, and through meditation and mindfulness gained a level of control over it.

Sitting down for the final exam of High School, to obtain his High School Certificate, he relaxed, and focused entirely on the paper in front of him. Over the course of nine hours, he carefully crafted the perfect essay. Spreading his focus once more, he waited long enough to allay any suspicion and handed is paper in with half an hour to go.

A small part of him felt guilty, that he was cheating, but as a whole he believed that there was nothing wrong with it, that it was a talent that he had nurtured and built on like an intellectual student would nurture and build on their natural intelligence.

Time passed, and first Italy, then Germany and then much of Europe fell under the harsh boot of Fascism. It was a tinderbox once more, and when Fascist and Communist troops moved into Poland, it burst into flame.

Sam was working as a surgeon, and he watched the news roll in as the Phony War turned hot and France fell. He watched the desperate attempts to evacuate the British Expeditionary Forces, and celebrated soberly with the rest of the nation for the Miracle at Dunkirk.

During the massive buildup in the years to follow, he enlisted as a Medic in the British Army, and so found himself three years later on a flimsy landing craft at Juno Beach in Operation Neptune.

Dashing ashore, the red cross blazoned on his helmet scant protection against the mines, artillery and machine gun fire of the German defenders, he flung himself down next to a man shot in the chest, scant moments from death. Forgetting the hail of death and destruction all around Sam focused entirely on the wounded man and time drifted to a stop.

He worked, slowly and methodically, with all the time in the world, and when he resumed time the injuries were patched and the man was stable.

Over the course of the next week, he would save dozens of lives that no other medic could save, before he was himself shot trying yet another mortally wounded soldier. He was rushed back across the Channel, where he recovered in the same hospital he had worked in before the war, and shortly after was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for his actions in Europe.

In years to come, he would think back to the war with regret, wondering how many more young men could have been saved had he not been shot.

Time passed, and he returned to work at the hospital, growing in prominence as one of the worlds top surgeons, and there he met Anne, a 32 year old nurse, and two years later, at the age of 41, he married her. Over the years, he would try to tell her about this strange phenomenon that affected him, but he could never work out how and eventually gave up.

Time passed, and Sam developed cancer of the liver. Despite the best treatment, he steadily declined. On his final day on the earth, his wife sat by his bedside, their grown children surrounding them, and through the pain Sam relaxed. Days past, as he gazed at his loved ones frozen in time, until finally he felt ready. He drew outwards once more, and died with 'I love you' on his lips and a soft smile on his face.

US announced the decision hours after China said it would curb visas to some Americans heading to Hong Kong, itself a tit-for-tat response to a US move.
United States has been leading a global uproar over a national security law approved by China, which Hong Kong activists say would destroy the city's freedoms.
""We can no longer distinguish between the export of controlled items to Hong Kong or to mainland China,"" Pompeo said in a statement. ""We cannot risk these items falling into the hands of the People's Liberation Army, whose primary purpose is to uphold the dictatorship of the CCP by any means necessary,"" he said, referring to the Chinese Communist Party.
The State Department last year approved $2.4 million in defense sales to Hong Kong, of which $1.4 million worth were actually sent, including firearms and ammunition for law enforcement, according to official figures.
The Commerce Department simultaneously said it was revoking its special status for Hong Kong. It will now treat the financial hub the same as China for so-called dual-use exports that have both military and civilian applications -- and which are highly restricted when sought by Beijing.
China promised autonomy for Hong Kong before Britain returned the territory in 1997 but wants no repeat of massive and sometimes destructive protests that rocked the territory last year.
""It gives us no pleasure to take this action, which is a direct consequence of Beijing's decision to violate its own commitments under the UN-registered Sino-British Joint Declaration,"" Pompeo said.
President Donald Trump's administration has already declared that Hong Kong is no longer autonomous in US eyes and has been rolling out a series of measures in response. On Friday, the State Department said it was restricting visas for an unspecified number of Chinese officials seen as responsible for infringing on the autonomy of the Asian financial hub.
In response, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Monday that the US ""scheme... to obstruct the passage of the Hong Kong national security law will never prevail.""
""To target the US's above wrongful actions, China has decided to impose visa restrictions against American individuals who have behaved egregiously on matters concerning Hong Kong,"" Zhao said.
While outlawing acts of subversion, secession, terrorism and colluding with foreign forces, the legislation will allow China's security agencies to set up shop publicly in the city for the first time.
Britain, the European Union and the United Nations rights watchdog have all voiced fears the law could be used to stifle criticism of Beijing, which uses similar laws on the authoritarian mainland to crush dissent.
In Washington, some US lawmakers fear that Trump will take primarily symbolic action on Hong Kong, preferring to prioritize trade concerns that could affect his re-election campaign.
Last week, the US Senate unanimously approved a bill that would impose mandatory economic sanctions against Chinese officials, Hong Kong police -- and banks that work with them -- if they are identified as hurting the city's autonomous status.
Zhao, the foreign ministry spokesman, warned that the US ""should not review, advance or implement relevant negative bills concerning Hong Kong, even less impose so-called sanctions on China, otherwise China will firmly take strong countermeasures.""
Hong Kong was upended by seven straight months of protests last year, initially sparked by an eventually abandoned plan to allow extraditions to the mainland. But they soon morphed into a popular revolt against Beijing's rule and widespread calls for democracy.

I'm going to give you my standard condom advice, but I'm going to preface it with a warning that you're still pretty young — enjoy your life, there's no rush to get laid. But if you do, I want you and your partner to be protected.


Girth (circumference) is the most important factor in choosing a condom. Most condoms are longer than most dicks; if it doesn’t unroll all the way, that’s fine, it’s designed with that in mind. Please note that your girth is not the same measurement as the condom width (condom ""nominal"" width is measured by laying the unrolled condom flat, so instead of the diameter you get one half to the circumference — I don’t know why they do it that way — plus a stretch factor because latex).

First step is to [plug your girth measurement into this handy condom size calculator](https://calcsd.netlify.app/condoms). Please note that your girth is not the same measurement as the condom width (condom ""nominal"" width is measured by laying the unrolled condom flat, so instead of the diameter you get one half to the circumference — I don’t know why they do it that way — plus a stretch factor because latex). 

If you’re uncommonly thick, you should give some consideration to getting some specialty-sized condoms. You can get them from [myONE](https://www.myonecondoms.com/) (USA), [TheyFit](https://www.theyfit.co.uk) (UK + International), or [My.Size](https://www.mysize-condoms.com) (Europe).

It may be very difficult for you to find appropriately sized condoms at your local stores, leaving you with no choice but to order online at a possibly higher cost. That's our cross the bear. I cannot overstate how strongly I discourage using a too-small condom — it’s painful, it wrecks your erection, and you’re at a greatly increased risk of breakage and thus accidental pregnancy or STD transmission. No matter what you’ve been told in sex ed, condoms are **not** one size fits all.

Everyone experiences stuff like this. It is only highlighted as a nation wide tragedy when it happens to black people though. This leads to the perception that they are singled out when that is just not the case. There are vids online that never make mainstream media that will show horrible things that happen to people of all races in america from thugs,bad cops, and just straight up assholes.

 I will tell you right now that I have been harassed and attacked for my race, things that happen to all types of people, because we live in a multi-racial society. No matter what, as long as you live in a mulit-racial society then everyone will at one point will be attacked for their race. It is inevitable. 

The difference from the judgement being put on white people and what I gave to my attackers back then is that  I  thought they were just straight-up assholes. Individuals who act out of order.A positive blame-free judgement I make for Brown/Black people that liberals feel non-white people should always get, but not towards White people.  

 I and others when attacked never thought about what it meant to me or them as a person of European descent, nor did I think about other White people at the time and if they went through the same experiences I have. Now after a few years of liberal aggression I might have to start having such a mindset.

The worldwide number of recorded infections is now just over 10 million from the virus that first emerged in China late last year, with fears growing of a full-blown second wave. The rate of contagion has doubled since May 21.
One million new infections were recorded in just six days, according to AFP news agency, even as some countries loosen punishing lockdowns that have devastated their economies and thrown millions out of work.
United States, the hardest-hit country, has more than 2.5 million cases alone, and efforts to reopen the world's biggest economy have been set back by a jump in new infections in big states such as Florida and California.
President Donald Trump was under growing pressure to set an example by wearing a face mask as his health secretary warned the ""window is closing"" for the country to gain control of the situation.
The disease is also rampaging through Latin America, where Brazil alone has over 1.3 million cases.
Infections are up too in some other parts of the world that have reopened, with Europe registering a caseload of over 2.6 million, although daily rates have stabilised.
The US state of California was the latest authority to reimpose restrictions, ordering bars in Los Angeles and six other counties -- an area with 13.5 million residents -- to close because of the rising number of cases. The hardest-hit parts of the US are in the south and west, where many state leaders had pushed for early economic reopenings.
But Los Angeles, the second-largest US city, only re-opened its bars on June 19. California had already ordered some areas to reinstate stay-at-home orders, while San Francisco announced a ""pause"" in its reopening.
In Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis conceded there had been an ""explosion"" in new cases as the state notched a record 9,585 cases in 24 hours. Miami announced beaches would close over the July 4 holiday weekend and bars are also shutting their doors.
New coronavirus cases have been surging in more than half of US states, reaching record highs.
Several other countries have also imposed new restrictions to counter fresh outbreaks. China imposed a strict lockdown on nearly half a million people in a province surrounding Beijing to contain a fresh cluster.
Beijing official Xu Hejian described the situation as ""severe and complicated"".
Iran, which has struggled to curb its outbreak even as it gradually lifted restrictions from April, said it would make mask-wearing mandatory in certain areas from next week.

&gt; Nsala, the man in the picture, was photographed by English missionary Alice Seeley Harris after he arrived at her mission clutching a parcel that contained what was left of his five-year-old daughter. She'd been killed and dismembered as a punishment when his village failed to meet the rubber quotas demanded by the imperial regime. Harris went on to take hundreds of pictures like this, documenting the violence, enslavement, and exploitation inflicted on the Congolese people by agents of the Belgian King Leopold II, Queen Victoria's cousin. 

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48533964

&gt; The photo was taken in 1904 at a missionary outpost in Baringa, in what was then called the Congo Free State. The man's name was Nsala and his wife and children had just been killed. Alice Seeley Harris's photograph of Nsala, looking at his five-year-old daughter Boali's severed hand and foot caused an uproar back in Europe. The resulting public pressure eventually forced Belgium's King Leopold II - Queen Victoria's cousin - to loosen his grip on the colony famously depicted in the novel Heart of Darkness.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_democracy) talks about this (past experience is that wiki is fairly reliable) and it brings up the third way because of neoliberalism:

"" With the rise in popularity of neoliberalism and the New Right by the 1980s, many social-democratic parties incorporated the Third Way ideology, aiming to fuse economic liberalism with social-democratic welfare policies.\[31\] By the 2010s, social-democratic parties that accepted triangulation and the neoliberal\] shift in policies such as austerity, deregulation, free-trade, privatization and welfare reforms such as workfare experienced a drastic decline\[33\] as the Third Way had largely fallen out of favour in a phenomenon known as Pasokification. ""

Which led me to pasokification:

"" **Pasokification** is the decline of centre-left social-democratic political parties in Europe and several other Western countries during the 2010s and the simultaneous rise of nationalist, left-wing and right-wing populist alternatives""

I think what happened to the Greeks was a result of debts put in place by entities like the IMF and World Bank, so it is incumbent upon me to understand if a social democrat is for globalism or nationalism.  Globalism, is an insidious move toward international authoritarianism.  I'm a nationalist because I see the US constitution (on paper) as antithetical to authoritarianism of any kind. Both Trump and Bill Clinton have shown signs of authoritarian rule.\*  As today some people (like Bill Maher) are worried about Trump not leaving office if he was voted out, I was similarly  worried when Bill Clinton was in office.  He transformed this nation in such a profound way and we are just now starting to feel the effects of that transition.  Putting the USA into the WTO was why an American factory can move to China.  NAFTA only allows a USA company to move to Mexico and Canada.  However the controlled media always talks about NAFTA and almost never mentions the WTO because they want people to forget it is there (they can covertly give it more power when the public's gaze isn't upon it).

[],,RoyalWait,1554077353.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_3inuqn5r,False,False,[],"I kind of reject the premise of this argument. let's break it down bit by bit:

* In the 1700s, Germans in America weren’t considered white.

I don't think the problem was seen as Americans are white and germans are not - which I'm pretty sure we can say is definitively false, because whiteness was a prerequisite for citizenship and I think germans were eligible for citizenship. The problem was that Americans were British and Germans were German. They were basically the first major european, non british, immigrant group to the US.

* Later, Germans were fully accepted as White Americans, and their culture is seen as very American with hotdogs or Christmas trees not being even slightly foreign.

Ignoring the white part, which I already dispelled, Germans were really only seen as full Americans really recently --- up to world war 1 they were still speaking the German language, and during world war 2 they were interned in camps similar to the Japanese. Also, in terms of food, it's important to remember how recent a lot of American cuisine is. The cheeseburger and chocolate chip cookies are both under 100 years old. And although there has been pizza in the US since the early 1900s, it was unknown outside of the Italian community until after world war 2 (there is like a NYT article from the 1940s explaining what pizza is). This isn't unique to the US by the way, a lot of cuisine in general is surprisingly young. As examples, Nachos were invented in the 1940s, and Tiramisu was invented in the 1960s.

&gt; In the end of the 19th century and in the early 20th Century, ethnic groups such as Italians, Irish and Polish weren’t considered White.

Again I dispute this a bit, there definitely were some ideas that they were racially inferior (keep in mind that this was a period where social darwinism was a popular concept, and these countries were basically third world at this time period). However, in terms of segregation, which was extensively legally defined, these people were considered white.

Finally, if we consider latinos as a whole, which I'll basically use the definition of anyone from a Portuguese or Spanish speaking country, then we end up with an extremely racially diverse population. It's hard to tell but mestizos (people of mixed amerindian and european descent) probably only make up 50% of the total population there, and it's far from evenly distributed. Compared to the US, Latin America has more Japanese, more Arabs, more Italians, and almost as much germans (much more if you only count people who speak German). It's not rare at all to be a blond haired, blue eyed latino. I think in the US, nobody would question their whiteness, rather, people would question their latino-ness.

I think the most important factor is that while racism is a similar problem in both Latin America and the US, they way people think about race is not. The George Floyd protests kind of reverberated in Brazil, and one post I saw discussed common arguments used by white people there. It read, ""I can't be racist, my grandfather is black"". and the answer was, ""your grandfather might be black, but you aren't"". In some ways, this is the case here already. Someone like shaun king is frankly not going to be racially profiled in the US. But in the US, in addition to race being something which you are profiled by based on appearance (which basically works the same as in Latin America) it is also an identity which people cling to even if it does not at all match their personal appearance.",True,False,False,,,,0,1593589360,,False,0,{},fwk9zni,False,t3_hir0ua,False,False,t3_hir0ua,/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/hir0ua/do_you_think_that_latinos_will_assimilate_and_be/fwk9zni/,False,,1602187204,13,True,False,PoliticalDiscussion,t5_2sfmf,r/PoliticalDiscussion,public,,0,[],

Basically:

1. Don't rush things. There's no good reason to land colonists as soon as you can. Get your required infrastructure up and running before landing. Make sure you've scanned anough sectors to find a good landing spot: flat, easy access to concrete and rare metals. I don't usually land until 20-30 SOLs have passed. I miss a couple of early achievements, but so what.
2. If founders are getting earthsick it's because they have low comfort and/or sanity. So have an infirmary, have a diner, have some comfortable housing, don't work people on night shifts in your production buildings, but DO in service buildings.
3. You don't need 6 people in a farm to begin with. 2/3 is enough to make sure the crop doesn't fail.
4. You don't need to fully man every building at first, when you don't have enough colonists. Right-click the job slots to enable/disable. If you turn off a whole shift it will save power. Stagger the shifts so power usage is spread out.
5. Have the right people in your first rocket. I've already described this in the stickied thread. Go look. tl;dr Sexy.
6. You're short of money. Loads has been written on this but: a) choose a sponsor that gives you regular income (Europe, USA), b) start mining rare metals ASAP. Just a trickle is fine at first.
7. If you're running out of resources during a disaster then you need more stored (batteries, water towers, O2 tanks). Don't overdo the batteries because they eat polymers. Remember that you can collect surface deposits of metals from all over the map with RC collectors.
8. TAKE IT SLOW! 40-50 buildings is far too many if you can't afford to maintain them. Build just *enough* services, not every service. One ""service slice"" per 50 people consisting of infirmary, diner, grocer is plenty. For many, many SOLs, you can survive in just 1 or 2 domes, mining rare metals for export, building up stockpiles, importing small amounts of electronics &amp; machine parts as required.

&gt;Wie der SZ vorliegende Dokumente nahelegen, fühlt sich der Verfassungsschutz vom Ministerium ausgebremst. Anlass ist die AfD. Meyer-Plath wehrt sich gegen Lösch-Anweisungen seines künftigen Nachfolgers, die einen nachrichtendienstlichen Schaden, einen bundesweiten Ansehensverlust im Verfassungsschutzverbund der Länder sowie „einen politischen Schaden für das Innenministerium und Minister Wöller“ persönlich zur Folge hätten.
&gt;
&gt;Demnach soll das Landesamt Daten von AfD-Abgeordneten löschen, die bisher im Rahmen eines Prüffalls in der Behörde erhoben wurden und zur Einschätzung extremistischer Bestrebungen nötig seien. Referatsleiter Christian argumentiert mit dem besonders geschützten Mandat von Abgeordneten, obwohl es Regeln zur Beobachtung extremistischer Bestrebungen gibt, und, obwohl die Löschanweisung einen empfindlichen Schaden für die bundesweite Sicherheitsarchitektur bedeutet.
&gt;
&gt;„Der Freistaat Sachsen würde öffentlich wahrnehmbar in einem der dynamischsten Felder des modernen Rechtsextremismus, der auch als Nährboden für gewaltbereite Rechtsextremisten von Bedeutung ist, seine Arbeit einstellen“, heißt es in einer Stellungnahme Meyer-Plaths vom Mai an Christian. Werde die Erkenntnislage auf nahe Null reduziert, verliere der sächsische Verfassungsschutz die Bewertungs- und Prognosefähigkeit zur AfD und wegen der Vernetzung auch im gesamten Bereich der „Neuen Rechten“. Einstufungen von Pegida oder der seit einer Woche vom Bundesverfassungsschutz beobachteten Gruppe „Ein Prozent“, die nationalistische und völkische Initiativen verbindet, seien nicht mehr zu bewerkstelligen. Das Landesamt würde in dem Bereich „nicht nur blind, sondern auch sprachlos“. Unter dem Eindruck rechtsextremistischer Anschläge in Kassel, Halle und Hanau sei das untragbar.
&gt;
&gt;Das große Löschen dürfte massive Kapazitäten in Anspruch nehmen. So müssten Gutachten des Bundesamtes für Verfassungsschutz in Gänze gelöscht oder aufwendig geschwärzt werden. Das betreffe über 1.000 Seiten zum „Flügel“, sowie das 443 Seiten starke AfD-Gutachten. Für das Schwärzen von 1.020 betroffenen Dokumenten, so Meyer-Plath, wäre eine Arbeitszeit von 1.500 Stunden nötig. Das Material kann in allen anderen Bundesländern weiter genutzt werden, nur in Sachsen nicht.
&gt;
&gt;Konkret geht es im Streit mit dem Ministerium um mutmaßliche extremistische Aktivitäten von vier Abgeordneten des Sächsischen Landtags, eines EU-Parlamentariers sowie drei Bundestagsabgeordneten, darunter AfD-Bundeschef Tino Chrupalla, deren Daten das Amt löschen soll. Im Unterschied zu Verfassungsschutzbehörden anderer Bundesländer darf in Sachsen wegen der Gesetzeslage die Öffentlichkeit nicht transparent über laufende Prüf- und Verdachtsfälle informiert werden. (...)
&gt;
&gt;Ein neuer Geist sollte [mit Gordian Meyer-Plath] in den Verfassungsschutz einziehen. Mehr Beratung für Kommunalpolitiker und Schulen, weniger Abschottung. Der Verfassungsschutzbericht wurde um Informationen auf Landkreisebene erweitert. Der von vielen geforderte Mentalitätswechsel stieß bald an Grenzen. So schlug der Verfassungsschutz vor, Pegida nach eingehender Prüfung zum Beobachtungsfall zu erklären. Die Fachaufsicht im Innenministerium lehnte ab. Die Anhaltspunkte sollen Referatsleiter Dirk-Martin Christian entgegen der Einschätzung der Fachleute des Landesamtes nicht gereicht haben. (...)
&gt;
&gt;Auch in Sachen AfD beansprucht das Ministerium das letzte Wort – trotz gegenteiliger Einschätzung der Fachleute. Ausländer-, islam und demokratiefeindliche Äußerungen begründeten keine Bestrebungen gegen die Verfassung, schrieb Referatsleiter Christian im Zuge der Auseinandersetzung um die Löschanweisung. Selbst völkisch-nationalistisch geprägte Argumentationsmuster fielen seiner Ansicht nach nur ins Gewicht, wenn belegbar sei, dass der Parlamentarismus des Grundgesetzes durch eine völkische Gesellschaftsordnung ersetzt werden solle. Meinungsäußerungen seien kein Beleg für eine verfassungsfeindliche Zielsetzung, so Christian. Auch die Mitgliedschaft im rechtsextremistischen „Flügel“ der AfD wie im Fall von Landeschef Jörg Urban rechtfertige allenfalls eine vorübergehende Beobachtung.
&gt;
&gt;Verfassungsschutzchef Meyer-Plath widerspricht. Reden und die Teilnahme an entsprechenden Veranstaltungen seien eine Aktivität mit dem Ziel, Mehrheiten für Meinungen zu schaffen, die mit der freiheitlich-demokratischen Grundordnung eben nicht im Einklang stünden. Würden solche Beiträge zur Meinungsbildung nicht berücksichtigt, entfiele der Charakter des Landesamtes als Frühwarnsystem. Als solches scheint Referatsleiter Dirk-Martin Christian den Verfassungsschutz nicht zu betrachten. Als Chef des Landesamtes soll er nun eben jenes „Frühwarnsystem für eine wehrhafte Demokratie“ führen, das umfassende Lagebilder für sämtliche extremistische Bedrohungen brauche. (...)
&gt;
&gt;Meyer-Plath schreibt an seinen künftigen Nachfolger, die Vermerke zu den AfD-Abgeordneten seien nach Anforderungen des Bundesverfassungsgerichts im bundesweiten Verfassungsschutzverbund und nach einem vom Bundesinnenministerium geprüften Handlungsleitfaden erstellt worden. „Ein alleiniges Abweichen Sachsens von dieser Linie wäre mehr als erklärungsbedürftig.“ Sachsen wäre das erste und einzige Bundesland, das mit den Datenlöschungen auch die Bearbeitung der als rechtsextremistische Verdachtsfälle eingestuften Organisationen „Flügel“ und „Junge Alternative“ einstellen müsste. Der Freistaat müsste auch jede Information, die aus dem Bundesamt oder anderen Länderbehörden kommt, sofort löschen. Meyer-Plath zufolge sind alle für die Extremismusaufklärung und -bewertung relevanten Akteure direkt oder indirekt dem Kreis der AfD-Abgeordneten zuzurechnen. (...)
&gt;
&gt;Meyer-Plath war, das zeigt der Schriftwechsel, nicht bereit, die Lösch-Anweisung klaglos hinzunehmen.

Fettgedruckt geht es weiter: „Es wird der Eindruck entstehen, dass das LfV Sachsen und damit auch das Sächsische Staatsministerium des Innern den Kampf des Freistaates gegen Rechtsextremismus – konkret die Auseinandersetzung mit der AfD – nicht, beziehungsweise nur sehr nachlässig wahrnimmt.“ Außerdem müssten das Bundesamt sowie das Bundesinnenministerium informiert werden, dass keine Dokumente mehr entgegen genommen und keine Dokumente mehr ungeschwärzt versandt werden könnten.

Brexit had filled my heart with anxiety and sorrow throughout. Seeing how the media pushed it day after day in the newspapers yet nobody at work would voice or even invite to discuss the subject made me feel left alone.

Only in very small forums you'd get people's opinions on Brexit and to my surprise many of my acquaintances were ok with it. When I told them I was worried they said I'd be fine cause of my other nationality, assuming I had a visa and wasn't there as a EU citizen. My concern wasn't so much about me, I'm just a regular person, with a normal job, not too much to offer. But I do see the world polarising more and more as days go by, like we're driving ourselves into war with one another by just refusing to talk to each other. I spent time talking to open brexiteers about why I thought Brexit was untimely. I don't care if the UK wants to leave the EU. But in the context of a world were being openly stupid, refuse fact checking and where basically the loudest voice is relevant regardless of the substance of their speech, dividing us is not something I'm okay with.

It felt to me like the people I met on a daily basis just let it happen, it felt like if they didn't talk about it, it would go away,  (99% of them, I recall 2 people being openly against it) or maybe they do want Brexit, but they're too worried to assume they're kinda racist, kinda classist kinds of people. Politics turned into drama in the past decade... or sports, we need to learn how to talk to one another again, even if we stand in opposing sides of a subject. That will be the challenge for our echo-chambered trivially obsessed youth. The world in general is racing towards a dark place. And that's terrifying to me, in the same way I just saw the Elephant walk the room and nobody even looking at it.

Then this information could be used to search for them, as this was a registered trait in your documents and in the official records.

Now, while worldwide Jews -- as a religion -- have *very* diverse phenotypes, think e.g. of the black Jews of Ethiopia, within each region/country which is not a typical immigration country (unlike the US or Israel) they were in fact noticably homogenous, exactly because their religion promotes endogamous relationships, ie. marrying outside of the community is frowned upon or even forbidden by religious laws. Even in more open communities which would allow marrying outside of the community (if the groom would convert), in the context of 19th and 20th century Europe this wouldn't noticably dilute the genetics, because such converts were very rare due to widespread antisemitism: even if some Jewish communities would have accepted others, there were no candidates interested in such a course of action.

That means, that in a place with little recent Jewish immigration you indeed had a median Jewish face that was distinct from the median local face.


This chart is not stereotyping for a racist reason. (""I think it's fun to make fun of the traits of others they cannot change. Let's exaggerate it"" -- like in minstrel shows). It is stereotyping for a practical reason. Naturally, being a stereotype it will fail in some concrete instances of its application.

EDIT: because you hanged up on the word ""race"": that word is due to OP. The word ""race"" or equivalent was never used by the people who commissioned the chart or those who drew it. It's OP that used that word in the title. The actual term used in Russian was *nationalnost'*, literally ""nationality"" but the best translation into today's American or British English would be ""ethnicity"", as it did not overlap, was in fact independent of the concept of *grazhdanstvo* ""citizenship"" which was the term used for the *legal relationship* between a state and a person which is captured in the English word ""nationality"" and using that would be thus misleading.

At the same time, your claim ""The whole premise of race is something the nazis propagated through Europe"" is a historically naive statement.

For example, instead of using the term ""police"" they will will ""state security forces.""

Here is a really great portrayal of how American media would write about the current BLM protests if it took place in some other country,

&gt; **Foreign Affairs: Unrest continues for a seventh day in former British colony**

&gt; Unrest and protests continued for a seventh straight day in the former British colony of the United States as the government vowed to use its military to end the demonstrations, US media reported on Tuesday.

&gt; The protests began in the small province of Minnesota, located in the agrarian ‘Middle West,’ over the killing of an ethnic minority by state security forces.

&gt; Protests led by the minority ‘black’ community have erupted throughout the country with the minority group calling for equal rights and better treatment from the government. Protesters have set fire to government installations and looted buildings throughout the country as clashes with security forces continue. The security forces have tried to disperse the protesters with tear gas, rubber bullets and batons but to no avail.

&gt; US President Donald Trump, who was ‘elected’ in 2016 despite the majority of votes going to his rival candidate, vowed in a speech to bring in the military to end the protests.

&gt; “I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,” Trump said in a national address.

&gt; Trump used the opportunity to walk to a religious temple in the national capital Washington DC to proclaim his religious affiliation. Holding a Christian bible in his hand, Trump declared the US “a great nation.”

&gt; **Religious Fundamentalism and persecution of minorities**

&gt; Religious fundamentalism and minority suppression has long been a problem in the former British colony.

&gt; The United States has had a long history of suppressing and persecuting its various ethnic minorities since the country gained its independence from the United Kingdom in 1776.

&gt; The treatment of its indigenous ‘Native Americans,’ its imported Asian and Black communities, and its Hispanic community has long been a source of friction.

&gt; American black minority groups were under a program similar to South Africa’s Apartheid policy until as recently as 1964. Today, the ethnic black community is still detained and killed with impunity by the state security forces and black Americans make up the majority of those incarcerated under the country’s archaic judicial system.

&gt; Religion also plays a major role in governance with religious beliefs separating key state organs including the country’s highest court where many social laws are passed based on the justices personally held religious convictions.

&gt; [Disclaimer: Native Americans is in quotations because it is a blanket term used by the ruling class of the US to call the country’s original inhabitants before the Anglo-European invasion. The ‘Native Americans’ are comprised of thousands of tribes, all with their own culture, language and traditions.]

De NAVO blijft in de voorzienbare toekomst de hoeksteen van het Nederlandse defensiebeleid. Daarnaast wordt er al grootschalig internationaal samengewerkt; de landmacht werkt zeer nauw samen met de Duitsers, de marine met de Belgen etc. De investeringen die nu gedaan worden betreffen puur het herstellen van jarenlange verwaarlozing. 

&gt;Misschien was mijn vraag niet duidelijk, maar: waarom? Wat is er onrealistisch of naief aan? Je ziet nu ook al dat Nederland in NAVO-verband vaak kiest om specifieke taken op zich te nemen en andere taken aan andere landen over te nemen. Waarom zou je dat principe niet breder kunnen toepassen?

In het specifieke voorbeeld dat genoemd wordt: Frankrijk specialiseert zich in luchtverdediging. Dat zou dan betekenen dat Frankrijk een taak toebedeeld krijgt die veel minder risico op personele verliezen met zich meebrengt dan bijvoorbeeld het leveren van infanterietroepen die in direct gevechtscontact staan.

Buiten al deze hypothetische scenario’s wordt ik persoonlijk een beetje moe van de hele EU-leger discussie.

## Area

I am not saying every town should have public transport, that simply is not possible in the US. What I am saying is that there is a lack of it where it is possible. I know that in the pretty large space between metropolitan areas there is't much potential. But the towns *around* metropolitan areas, do have potential.

A lot of people there quite often have to visit the larger metropolitan area for anything from their job to groceries. **This is a potential for public transport.** Instead of taking the car and being stuck in traffic every morning because a lot of people have to get there, if more people took public transport, the traffic would lessen and it would be more beneficial for everyone. The companies behind the public transport could heighten the amount of busses and trains going towards it during the rush hour and the other way in the evening to meet the demand.

Other than that traffic, longer distance trains could travel between the larger cities. On a train people can still work on things on their laptop if they want to and generally it causes less stress than being in the car, possibly stuck in traffic, again. If public transport companies would work with subscriptions to a certain route you travel often that make it cheaper you might even be able to save on the cost in comparison to fuel, maybe they could lower the cost a bit more if it's job traffic and the company you work for has a deal with the train company. They could also advertise it as an easy way to do a city trip without having to worry about parking your car during holidays.

## Government Subsidisation

The US government already has an infrastructure problem that should be solved first. A redistribution of funds to put a bit more emphasis on maintaining the current infrastructure first before building new infrastructure certainly is a hurdle that should be tackled before even trying to do this.

## Everyone owns a car

I don't expect everyone to give up their car. For some things you'll obviously still need your car. Public transport cannot do everything. What it can do is lessen the burden on high traffic routes. They wouldn't be giving up any freedom.

## Efficiency

The main reason it's currently so inefficient is because of the lack of public transport present. If there would be more it would be about as fast. This is simply put a circular argument, if it's not efficient no one will use it, so we won't use public transport, which causes it to be inefficient.

Something else to consider is comfort, if it was slightly slower, but you had to spend less time sitting behind a steering wheel frustrated at traffic, *for some people*, it would be a better option. I'm not saying this would be a valid argument for all people, but there definitely is a market.

## Impossible infrastructure

I live in Belgium, in Flanders more specifically. Belgium is one of the most densely *""infrastructured""* places. It is possible, you just need to actually plan and maintain (admittedly Belgium doesn't do as good a job as it could, but good enough to keep it working). It's not so much that the infrastructure is impossible, it's more the government being unwilling to assign funds to a project like that.

## Uber

The Uber idea certainly is a good temporary solution but it's vastly less efficient than actual public transport. It still has way more cars on the road which causes more traffic, and with that, traffic jams.

## EU vs US

I am well aware you can't just copy the EU system into the US. It would quite frankly be idiotic to think so. This however does not mean that you cannot look at the public transport systems around the world and see what could work in the US.

## More Availability = More Usage

If you need proof that availability of public transport leads to usage, look at all the countries that installed public transport, and look at the usage of the public transport. It does work. All you need is funds to start it, and a bit of advertising of the reasons it is worth using.

After 25 years in Health, have gone from direct patient care to managing statewide projects. Am still ""lucky"" to have gotten the job I did. Funny that. I went to the interviews, achieved what I did, went to more interviews. Worked *harder*.  Seemingly, I should've just rolled dice with the other applicants.

Now, it's, ""Happy to help you with a deposit like we've done with your brothers, but we want you to pay it back with interest"". Hmmm. I've paid off $44K in debt by myself. My wife and I have saved $62K for a home deposit. Over the last five years. We had a trip to Europe for 5 weeks during that period (pre-DR!). And I didn't ask for help.

No. Don't need your money. Thanks for offering, but. No.

I'm not worried about keeping up with the Jones's. I don't know them. They don't know me. I don't care.

Rant. Over.

Your personal finances are exactly that. They are personal.

Family can (and will) snipe from the sidelines. So? It may sting, but bankruptcy and worries will ache you like you have no idea. This is why DR says to be weird.

At my work, many of us are OK during this craziness. But some aren't. It's no joy on my part, but yearly holidays overseas and overspending on home improvements hasn't worked for them in these days.

I wish them well, despite being snickered at for my position on debt. You can only control you. And. Be. Weird. It works!

[],,Cantholdaggro,1465001870.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_yfr0n,False,False,[],"Damn, I mean it’s definitely possible but it will be tough. You’d have to always place at speed 4, always be at war, and always be at 90%+ OE. You’d do this by fighting 3-5 wars at a time. 

Typically I’ll fight 3~ easy wars and fight 1 hard war simultaneously. The purpose of the easy wars are you get you instantly at 90%+ OE so that the months/years I spend at war with the hard nation aren’t wasted.

Sit on nations for years if you have to and just peace them out when they fit into your OE requirements. Also, with big nations that require multiple wars, don’t be obsessed with 100% WS. Click on a province to see how much it’ll cost in WS to take the entire nation and divide that by 100. If they have 340 WS for example, you know you can’t take them out in a single war, or even 3, so don’t aim for that. Instead, aim for 4 80~ WS wars. 80 WS is way easier to get than 99 and subsequent wars will be even easier so you can save the higher WS costing wars for those.

Also, big tip would be to take overseas territory first in peace deals with massive colonial powers. You’ll never go out there to take over territory in war, so it’s better to let them keep their power base in Europe where you can easily siege them down and get a larger amount of WS in subsequent wars because it’s a higher portion of their territory.

Also, for colonial nations, put a stack on a big fleet the enemy won’t fight and bring the fleet to a colonial nation’s capital and take it, then take 5 provinces to core for the CN to spawn once you’ve done it. In subsequent wars you can ask them to cede the land in that colonial region without having to take a fort or even win. 

Speaking of colonial nations, after you make an enemy cede their entire colony to your colony, your colony will have like 400% OE. Keep an army (or in Mexico’s case, 3-4) there to put down rebels. Micromanage then otherwise your CN May implode.

Also, give your colonial nations like 20-30g in subsidies. This will allow them to merc up and stabilize way faster. It’ll also let them be an actual asset in wars sooner. The sooner you get your CN strong enough to beat enemy CN’s the faster your wars with colonial powers will be and the easier, because you won’t have to do anything on the western hermisphere.

Backtracking to your power base, take your low hanging fruit. You can take all of what’s left in Africa in 5~ years which will allow you to move armies out of there and concentrate on your wester and eastern fronts which are the most important. 

You can and should ignore Russia as best you can. Worst case scenario you can truce break with them and take all their land in like 20 years, but your eastern and western fronts are made up of huge composites of different nations. By constantly being at war there, you can make massive gains in a short time because truce timers won’t be a factor.

Lastly, your manpower should never be 0 at this point. In a WC you would’ve wanted Quantity like within first 5 ideas. Be sure to get it now. Also make sure you have humanist, Administrative, and Diplomatic (and quantity). 

Humanist = no rebels = can always be 99% OE
Administrative = CCR
Diplomatic = province WS cost reduction, gives you opportunity to go over 100 OE to 1 shot a nation.
Quantity = infinity manpower.

Generally those 4 along with influence are mandatory for an efficient WC, but by now you’re past the point where influence is going to do much for you, and frankly as the ottoman already have massive CCR bonuses, vassal feeding isn’t super useful.

That being said, i’d really just take this campaign as lessons for future campaigns. Unless you’re experienced. You should know your campaign goals from day 1. The age of discovery is easily the most important age for WC. In the age of discovery, you can neutralize your future end game competition before they’re a threat. For example, you can take the age objective of vassal demand reduction to take Naples and Aragon from Castillo, ensuring they fall off. You can take Norway/Sweden from Denmark to then take novgorod from Novogorod or Muscovy, ensuring that Russia is never formed. You can invade England early through Ireland or directly over the channel and take London and ensure they can never be GB. You can attack Ottoman and take 1 Bulgarian, 1 Byzantine, and 1 Serbian, and 1 Karaman, Serbian, or walloncian province to release them as vassals and then hit the ottomans with a reconquest CB. In 3 50% wars you can kill them. 

You can also plan to min-max more, potentially taking HRE emperorship, or choosing your eary-mid game conflicts better to have a stronger base of power.

For example, your trade income is hurting because you don’t own an end node. If earlier in the campaign you took Venezia, your trade income would be like 20% higher.

Also if you know you’re going to WC, you’ll play more meta orientated and will stick to late game idea groups that I mentioned rather than shit like economic, espionage, early military ideas.",True,False,False,,,,0,1593600659,,False,0,{},fwkl49b,False,t3_hj55mm,False,True,t3_hj55mm,/r/eu4/comments/hj55mm/my_best_run_so_far_but_is_it_still_doable_to_get/fwkl49b/,False,,1602193322,3,True,False,eu4,t5_2uqat,r/eu4,public,,0,[],

*Period competition history including 1929 TT

*No expense-spared maintenance

*In-period competition history

Re-bodied as a saloon whose coachwork was scrapped following a wartime raid, this Boulogne was intended for restoration and after a long time those intentions became reality when it was re-bodied as a Super Sport. An ultra-lightweight body was built by Frazer Nash Car Club captain Bill Roberts and it saw many racing outings before being campaigned by Roberts' son, Steve Stanton: in 1999 it was part of the FNCC's Raid to Bolzano. One year later it was bought by the vendor. The engine was re-built and other mechanicals overhauled, without replacing any original parts. Since then it has taken part in numerous mainland European events including the 2010 Alpenfahrt and Vernasca in 2011 and 2012. Today it is described by the vendor as being in 'top condition', with a 'marvellous patina'.

With much competition history and much expenditure over the years this Boulogne Super Sport is an important part of 'Nash history and should delight any lover of 'true' British sporting cars.

I was warned that reintroducing meat into my diet might be a problem, that my gut would have ""forgotten"" how to digest it after being vegetarian for ten years. But my first steak was actually the best I've ever felt gut-wise after a meal. Go figure!

Are you noticing any problems from grains and dairy specifically? For me, I had felt digestive discomfort (and the post-meal slump) all my life and gotten so used to it, that I didn't notice it was there until it went away and I felt a lot of relief. (There is no slump after eating a steak!) So I would say if you are suspicious, it's certainly worth a try. Only took me a week or two to notice a significant difference in my energy levels and emotional stability.

Have you cut out refined sugar (and ideally. all processed foods) already? For me, that made a huge difference too.

I mean think of it this way. When I ask myself, is this something I'm supposed to be eating, I have to ask.. How many animals breastfeed their entire lives? Using the breast of a different species? Yeah, exactly.

&gt; When you think about it, the purpose of cow's milk is to turn a 65-pound calf into a 400 pound cow as rapidly as possible. Cow's milk is baby calf growth fluid. That's what the stuff is! Everything in that white liquid -- the hormones, the proteins, the lipids, the sodium, the growth factors, the IGF -- every one of those is meant to blow that calf up into a great big cow, or it wouldn't be there.

“the amazon is not the lungs of the world”
- Sure, it’s not a majority oxygen producer for the whole world. But it’s got tens of thousands of species found nowhere else that are losing habitat and going extinct. If the bullet was meant to justify continued deforestation of the amazon, he should remove bullet point 1. This is one way we are extincting species en masse.

But the majority of the world are not taking these measures; if he’s signaling these nations example as a reason there is no crisis, then the wider trajectory of world nations would suggest there is.

“The direct killing of species and habitat loss pose more of a threat to species than climate change”
- in itself, this statement only says that there are bigger threats, not that climate change is not also a serious threat.

&gt; Die USA haben nahezu alle Vorräte des Covid-19-Medikaments Remdesivir aufgekauft. Das berichtet der „Guardian“. Mindestens in den nächsten drei Monaten werde kein anderes Land auf der Welt den Wirkstoff kaufen können.

Das stimmt so einfach nicht. Der [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/30/us-buys-up-world-stock-of-key-covid-19-drug) selbst schreibt ja ganz in den letzten Absätzen etwas kryptisch (das habe ich dann mal gegoogelt):

&gt; Hill said there was a way for the UK to secure supplies of this and other drugs during the pandemic, through what is known as a compulsory licence, which overrides the intellectual property rights of the company. That would allow the UK government to buy from generic companies in Bangladesh or India, where Gilead’s patent is not recognised.

Immerhin hat die [Tagesschau](https://www.tagesschau.de/newsticker/liveblog-coronavirus-mittwoch-119.html) inzwischen bessere Informationen:

&gt; Zwischen den USA und der EU ist ein Streit um das Mittel Remdisivir ausgebrochen. Während das US-Gesundheitsministerium mitteilte, einen Großteil der bis September anvisierten Produktionsmenge des Mittels Remdesivir gesichert zu haben, er wartet das Bundesgesundheitsministerium ""noch in dieser Woche"" die Zulassung des Medikaments Remdesivir für die Behandlung von Covid-19-Patienten in der EU. ""Mit der Zulassung ist die Verpflichtung verbunden, auch in angemessenem Umfang liefern zu können. Wir gehen davon aus, dass Gilead dieser Verpflichtung auch nachkommt"", sagte ein Sprecher des Ministeriums.

The french revolution led to wars as every other country in europe was led by a parasitic aristocratic class who saw that the french were becoming democratic, were rightfully afraid that the people they were oppressing would also, quite rightfully and justly, do away with them, and so the kings &amp; queens and assorted parasites of Europe wanted to strangle democracy in its crib, so the entire rest of europe went to war with France, and France still, sort of, won in the end.

I don't know how education or propaganda went so badly wrong that people are thinking that the french would have been better off if they'd remained serfs. Yeah, *sure* the aristocrats would have just given them all their money in the end anyway. Every right by the common man has been won through force or the threat of force.

&gt;Het voorbeeld toont aan dat met de invulling zoals de AIV die voorstelt bepaalde landen een veel hoger risico op personele verliezen zullen lopen. Bepaalde landen zullen dus onevenredig veel manschappen verliezen in het geval van een conflict, niet wenselijk natuurlijk.

En dat zou nuttig zijn als de wereld morgen vergaat. Als we nu investeren, heeft dat pas resultaat in de toekomst, dus moet je weten wat nodig is voor het uitvoeren van de toekomstige taakinstelling.

Can you get your hands on a whole crab or two for cheap where you are?

So anyway, in a time when I was mostly an atheist, but before I cared about labels or epistemology or really any depth diving of the big questions, I was surrounded by friends who thought very much like me and came to similar conclusions. None of us save one we’re raised religiously. We’d heard some bible stories but never read them ourselves - and we thought they were insane and silly.

So all of a sudden, when reading Chaucer in a grade twelve literature class, when one of my peers got offended by the portrayal of religious leaders, it dawned on me christians were real. I had actually until that point never considered there were still people that believed the bible.

And then shortly thereafter, I discovered I was in fact in the minority - and the vast majority of people in Canada, USA, and Europe are christians.

&gt; But then why its mods literally remove different take on the situation? how is this liberal? they censored people, who didn't defend accused casters, but only questioned some of the accusations and how fast industry decided to cancel their careers.

You have stumbled upon the issue with these two paragraphs without realizing it. You cannot create a community that does not tolerate racism, sexism, fascism, alt-right behavior, and other such behaviors without removing certain takes on situations. To use your DotA 2 example, it would be racist to say ""Russians and Ukranians have cheating in their blood"" in response to the huge amounts of cheating present on Eastern Europe/Russian servers, but it's also a different take on that situation. You cannot simultaneously let me post that *and* be creating an anti-racist community, and banning me for posting it would be totally justified.

Anyway, let's look at your post history on the issue:

* Reddit cancelled X and Y personality, why not Z and Q?
* Video link to ""the privilege game"" as if it's relevant to current events
* An article defending personality R from accusations of misconduct.
* A post claiming girls have privilege in Esports, not removed.
* A removed post that appears to have been a Russian personality basically dismissing certain actions/pressuring people into sex as not bad (also, funnily enough, a *literal Nazi* with 1488 in his username is the most upvoted post explicitly supporting the argument.) Based on the comments, it explicitly said female personalities were lying.
* A post saying that Personality X was always nice to her, implying the accusations against him are false.
* A removed post from a Russian personality that was definitely dismissing certain actions/pressuring people into sex as not bad, and only implicitly argued that the women were lying.

It is *very clear* your intent was to defend certain casters, and that you were repeatedly posting ""different takes"" that were outright attacking the women claiming they were being abused. It is not possible to create a community free of sexism while allowing these sort of things, because by nature many of these takes were promoting the idea that women in general, and especially specific women, make up abuse for attention. Further, the fact that you weren't open about what you were doing, and your comments being extremely combative towards the moderation of the subreddit, make me question your version of events surrounding the action taken against you.

If you truly want a community free of sexism, as you claim, you have to understand that means removing posts and comments that are sexist, promote sexism, or foster support for sexists in the community. Now that you're a few days removed from your ban, you should be able to look back at your posts and realize that *maybe* if you're getting support from Nazis and almost exclusively doubting women in the community, you might have been one of those people promoting and supporting sexism in the community and it was justifiable to remove your posts.",True,False,False,,,,0,1593609058,,False,0,{},fwkvy3c,False,t3_hj9gx6,False,True,t3_hj9gx6,/r/changemyview/comments/hj9gx6/cmv_many_subreddits_here_declare_liberal_values/fwkvy3c/,False,,1602198981,21,True,False,changemyview,t5_2w2s8,r/changemyview,public,,0,[],

Lastly, there are different kinds of racism. There is aversive racism (that is, you avoid interacting with them), cultural racism (you beliefe your culture is superior to other cultures and take measures to demote them) and institutional racism (goverment and law are set up in a way, which disadvantages certain races).


Whereas nobody doubts that many European countries have aversive and cultural racist prople, they tend to be very little institutional racist. That is because many European countries have very strict equality-treatment-laws baked into their constitutions, which stops institutional racism to manifest itself in these countries (or at least those only exist, as long as unnoticed).

In contrary, the US has a big history of institutional racism, up to this day. For example, many US banks still evaluate estate based on the racial make up of the neighborhood. In Europe such practices are forbidden (that is not to say, that they do it silently anyway). A more subtle example: Private banks in the US give student loans based on the parents savings.

CONTROVERSIAL! CONTROVERSIAL! BUY! BUY!""**  I'm pretty sure he's decided that despite all his work over the decades everything is totally fucked, so he might as well cash in and enjoy his last decade or two in luxury.

Most of the article is just auto-fellatio, so let's look at his list of actual points. Many of his bullet-list statements are accurate only under the most rigorously deceptive terms. Others are irrelevant.

&gt;    Humans are not causing a “sixth mass extinction”

True if you mean ""people are not going out to deliberately hunt and kill enough creatures to cause a mass extinction."" Utter bollocks when you factor in habitat erosion, pollution, pesticides, and industrialisation. 

&gt;    The Amazon is not “the lungs of the world”

True -- that's the oceans, but we're acidifying those too, and the Amazon is one of our great reservoirs of biodiversity, as well as a decent indicator of what's going on in less famous natural places.

&gt;    Climate change is not making natural disasters worse

This seems the closest thing to a flat-out lie. I dare say he has some weasel definition of 'climate change' to base it off, but any meteorologist will tell you this is shite. Even I know that high sea surface temps are (a) a thing and (b) add power to hurricanes, and that's the most ""babby's first weather feedback"" thing there is.

&gt;    Fires have declined 25% around the world since 2003

Declined by what metric? By affected area? By affected human population? By number of police incident reports? This is too vague to meaningfully comment on.

&gt;    The amount of land we use for meat — humankind’s biggest use of land — has declined by an area nearly as large as Alaska

Maybe true -- since when though? Also, what about the huge chunks of Amazon razed, used for two years, and then abandoned as new waste/scrubland?

&gt;    The build-up of wood fuel and more houses near forests, not climate change, explain why there are more, and more dangerous, fires in Australia and California

It could certainly be a factor, if it's true, which it may well be. It's vanishingly unlikely to be the ONLY factor.

&gt;    Carbon emissions have been declining in rich nations including Britain, Germany and France since the mid-seventies

Yes, IF you include carbon-offsetting, aka paying other places to plant some trees. Which doesn't help as much as it should. And often isn't even done, a third party somewhere just takes your money and says it'll do it. And even so, SO WHAT? The planet is not just rich north-west Europe. 

&gt;    Adapting to life below sea level made the Netherlands rich not poor

... and? Are we supposed to assume, from that, that Florida will be stronger when the sea is 10m higher? Utterly irrelevant.

&gt;    We produce 25% more food than we need and food surpluses will continue to rise as the world gets hotter

Yes, we do, and corruption and supply-line inefficiency leave billions hungry. And there's no way to know how food surpluses will perform as the climate heats. That part of it is just a wild guess.

&gt;    Habitat loss and the direct killing of wild animals are bigger threats to species than climate change

SO FAR, Chupo. So far. On average. If you ignore polar creatures. Not for much longer, though.

&gt;    Wood fuel is far worse for people and wildlife than fossil fuels

On a Gigawatt by Gigawatt comparison, sure. Much more smoke from wood. I don't remember St. Greta and her little wizards calling on us to convert our trucks and planes to wood-burners.

&gt;    Preventing future pandemics requires more not less “industrial” agriculture

Again, just wild nonsense. There's absolutely no way to know how the industrialisation of agriculture will change future disease development. I _think_ he's saying ""If we pave the Earth then we can't get any pesky bat diseases because they'll all be dead"", but even that is irrelevant.

Anyway, i dont think this statue has, as of now, any particular intrinsic value. It's a hundred years hold, and doesnt look like a breakthrough in artistic technique either. If it does make the majority of belgian peoples uncomfortable, I think it can be removed. If belgians really dont want it anymore, they shouldn't be obliged to keep it, would be absurd. Like saying you have to keep the same tint on the walls of the house you bought. And, I mean, Popes used the colosseum as marble cave. These things, removing or devaluing a monument, or a future piece of art, happened before too. On the other hand I wouldn't like fascist architecture or fasci inscriptions to be removed, or devalued, or vandalized, here in Italy. Because I think they have historic relevance, do not directly offend pretty much anyone, and have often artistic value too. Despite not being belgian myself, I dont think these things apply instead to that particular leopold statue. On the other hand,  it could also serve as a monitus, remembering belgians of the atrocities their country committed, while just removing could simply be a quick way to forget those crimes, rather than an apology, but maybe a celebrative statue like this can hardly be converted to such function.",True,False,False,,,,0,1593610291,,1593610603,0,{},fwkxyah,False,t3_hj3fya,False,False,t1_fwkkhpv,/r/europe/comments/hj3fya/belgium_removes_statue_of_king_responsible_for/fwkxyah/,False,,1602200004,7,True,False,europe,t5_2qh4j,r/europe,public,,0,[],

Background: I have had my business since October 2018. Things have been going very well and I was able to take on an employee to help out in March 2020. Covid hit, and we were actually doing okay for a bit, so I chose not to take out any loans. However, the nature of my business thrives on people going to work or traveling (dog walking biz) and more and more people are either being laid off as opposed to furloughed, as well as cancelling travel far in advance, especially now the EU decided not to allow travelers from America.

I just spoke with my accountant about options, because I am really starting to feel the financial pressure. He suggested the PPP loan, but upon trying to apply I am seeing that I literally just missed the deadline by a day. He mentioned that they extended it by 26 weeks, but I am not seeing that anywhere. To be totally honest I am not the most savvy person with the lingo used on the SBA or gov websites, so I’m trying to figure out what my options are. Anyone hear anything or know better than I?

 Coincidentally or as a consequence, the countries with the highest mortality from COVID-19 are also the countries that have demonized chloroquine the most, i.e. Western Europe and part of the United States. There is therefore a geographical pro- or anti-chloroquine correlation, on the one hand North-South, on the other hand West-East, which is beyond scientific data. A total of 4.6 billions of people live in countries where chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine are recommended for COVID-19.

Kristoff is another rider who has a better chance to win a sprint when it has been a very long and tough race. 200 km is some kind of boundary. Some very good riders are losing a bit of their punch or energy after the 200km mark. And classics riders do better since those races are longer.

I think a results like [this](https://www.procyclingstats.com/race/gent-wevelgem/2019/result) Gent Wevelgem last year is a good example, although arbitrary chosen. A 250 km race with cobbles and hills. 30 man bunch sprint at the end with a huge number of fast men. But the first riders where Kristoff, Degenkolb, Naesen and VDP. 4 classics riders. While the more true sprinters like Viviani and Gaviria got 19th and 21th. Probably not much energy left after 250 km.

And Mathieu imo has enough experience with long races. 300 km for Milan San Remo is long, but it doesn't have that many hills. Amstel is 265 km with many many hills, he did well too in Flanders and GW, which are both around the same length as Amstel. Even in Dwars door Vlaanderen (and Brabantse Pijl too) I felt like he had plenty of energy left after 200 km by stomping fast man like Alaphilippe and Matthews. They didn't have a chance.

During the Middle Ages, Jewish people under Muslim rule experienced tolerance and integration. Some historians refer to this time period as the ""Golden Age"" for the Jews, as more opportunities became available to them. In the context of day-to-day life, Abdel Fattah Ashour, a professor of medieval history at Cairo University, states that Jewish people found solace under Islamic rule during the Middle Ages.The Muslim rule at times didn't fully enforce the Pact of Umar and the traditional Dhimmi status of Jews; i.e., the Jews sometimes, as in eleventh-century Granada, were not second-class citizens. Author Merlin Swartz referred to this time period as a new era for the Jews, stating that the attitude of tolerance led to Jewish integration into Arab-Islamic society.

Social integration allowed Jews to make great advances in new fields, including mathematics, astronomy, philosophy, chemistry and philology, with some even gaining political power under Islamic rule. For example, the vizier of Baghdad entrusted his capital to Jewish bankers, Jews were put in charge of certain parts of maritime and slave trade, and Siraf, the principal port of the caliphate in the 10th century, had a Jewish governor. Increased commercial freedom increased their integration into the Arab marketplace. 

Leon Poliakov writes that in the early ages of Islam, Jews enjoyed great privileges, and their communities prospered. No laws or social barriers restricted their commercial activities, and exclusive trade and craft guilds like those in Europe did not exist. Jews who moved to Muslim lands found themselves free to engage in any profession, resulting in less stigma than in Europe where such restrictions were still in force.",True,False,False,,,,0,1593611729,,False,0,{},fwl0e5p,False,t3_hj7pfr,False,False,t1_fwkzj8r,/r/anime_titties/comments/hj7pfr/italy_seizes_world_record_14tonne_of_isismade/fwl0e5p/,False,,1602201236,44,True,False,anime_titties,t5_2n4vyh,r/anime_titties,public,,0,[],

“I don’t view humanity as a single species...”  
  
“The whole breeding arena of the species needs to be cleaned the fuck up!”  
  
""Screaming 'racism' at people because blacks are collectively less intelligent...is insane.""  
  
“You cannot run a high IQ [white] society with low IQ [non-white] people…these [non-white] immigrants are going to fail...and they're not just going to fail a little, they are going to fail hard…they're not staying on welfare because they’re lazy...they’re doing what is economically the best option for them...you are importing a gene set that is incompatible with success in a free-market economy.”   
Note: for this one the things in brackets were added for context. It's from a video about how non-white immigrants going to Europe will destroy European society, so the implications are pretty clear in context.  
  
“...the Germans were in danger of being taken over by what they perceived as Jewish-led Communism. And Jewish-led Communism had wiped out tens of millions of white Christians in Russia and they were afraid of the same thing. And there was this wild overreaction and all this kind of stuff.”  
Note: this is him ""describing"" (read: intentionally down-playing) the Holocaust  
  
“One of the biggest questions in America is ethnic crime rates...and y’know the [Asians] are the model minority…[while] the American blacks and blacks around the world have truly shockingly high levels of criminality and the general explanation is y’know slavery plus racism plus poverty, whatever it is which creates this unholy brew...but as far as I understand it there are significant contributions that your field can make to help people untangle [why] there are such differences in ethnic positive and negative behaviours in society...American blacks have roughly a standard IQ below whites... ”  
  
“If we could just get people to be nice to their babies for five years straight, that would be it for war, drug abuse, addiction, promiscuity, sexually transmitted diseases. Almost all would be completely eliminated, because they all arise from dysfunctional early childhood experiences, which are all run by women.”

 O gabinete de curiosidades e aberrações que se constituiu em torno do presidente é sinal de seu isolamento político. Bolsonaro simplesmente não parece ter ideia de onde se virar.

Lembro o que foi o ocaso do governo Collor. A abertura do processo de impeachment seria aprovada pela Câmara em setembro de 1992.

 Em plena desmoralização, Collor contava com ministros altamente respeitados.

 O célebre Adib Jatene foi nomeado para a Saúde em fevereiro daquele ano. Em março, entrava na Justiça um histórico jurisconsulto, Célio Borja. Considerado gênio em matéria de infraestrutura, Eliezer Batista foi para os Assuntos Estratégicos. Um intelectual de altíssimo nível, Hélio Jaguaribe, ocupou a Ciência e Tecnologia.

  O sempre admirado Fernando Henrique Cardoso só não entrou para as Relações Exteriores porque, numa reunião na cúpula do PSDB, Mário Covas fechou o tempo.

 Xingador, descontrolado, [adepto do jet-ski ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/painel/2020/05/apos-passeio-de-jet-ski-collor-avisa-bolsonaro-nas-redes-se-continuar-assim-vai-afundar.shtml)e com uma enfática agenda neoliberal, Collor ainda assim mantinha algumas alianças à esquerda.

 Em julho de 1992, Leonel Brizola participou de um comício com ele. Não sem malevolência, o livro “Collor Presidente”, de Marco Antonio Villa, recorda que Ruth Escobar, grande personalidade do teatro e da luta contra a ditadura, detinha um posto de adida cultural nos Estados Unidos.

Cavalheiros de fino trato e alta erudição, como Celso Lafer (Ministério das Relações Exteriores) entraram para o governo Collor em abril, seis meses antes do impeachment.

 Nomeado para a Cultura em 1991, Sérgio Paulo Rouanet —autor de ótimos livros sobre Walter Benjamin e Freud— ficaria com Fernando Collor até o seu amargo fim.

 Agora, nem Alexandre Frota apoia o presidente Bolsonaro. Até Olavo de Carvalho reclama.

 Os movimentos virtuais contra o governo vão de Alckmin a Boulos, dos que derrubaram Dilma aos que a apoiarão sempre. Na onda oposicionista, muitos se dão ao luxo de vetar adesões: “Sarney, Sergio Moro, Janaina Paschoal? Com esses eu não faço aliança”.

 O último vínculo de Bolsonaro com as “elites” fica sendo, assim, o economista Paulo Guedes

 Vejo-o sem máscara, o pobre, numa recente palhaçada presidencial. Ao fundo, o presidente da Embratur entoava a [“Ave Maria” na sanfona](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/joaopereiracoutinho/2020/06/sanfoneiro-de-bolsonaro-vandalizou-ave-maria-com-talento-de-um-iconoclasta.shtml), em homenagem aos mortos do coronavírus.

 Guedes parece ser convocado nos momentos solenes (como o da foto oficial pela saída de Moro) e costuma tomar cuidado com a contaminação.

 Pela cara, ou melhor, pela ausência de cara que demonstrou durante a récita religiosa, Guedes já parecia estar sob os efeitos da cloroquina; ou então aprendeu com Nelson Teich o uso tático da “facies cadaverica” nos momentos de estresse.

 Como ele aguenta? Um economista acostumado a ler (ainda por cima em inglês)... Um homem fino, à vontade nos salões do George V e do Crillon, capaz sem dúvida de distinguir um Château Margaux de um Saint-Émilion Cheval Blanc! 

 Ei-lo no mundo do guaraná Dolly, da sanfonada, do torresminho. Nem no governo Lula se viu uma coisa dessas. Triste situação para qualquer representante do “mercado”. Adaptando uma frase conhecida, é o caso de dizer que Delfim Netto, se estivesse morto, estaria se revirando na tumba.

 Claro que Paulo Guedes, a exemplo de tantos gênios das finanças, não tem problema com ditadores e generais.

 Mas pelo menos, quando trabalhou no [Chile de Pinochet](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2018/10/exemplo-de-guedes-chile-tem-contrarreforma-da-previdencia.shtml), havia alguns vinhos medianos e boas estações de esqui.

 É o que se chamaria de um retrocesso.

 Com Bolsonaro se sustentando graças ao auxílio mensal de R$ 600, Paulo Guedes se põe numa espécie de quarentena. Sua cloroquina é a crença de que, com novas reformas, e com a retomada de cortes e privatizações, haverá de voltar “a confiança do investidor”.

 Eis uma fórmula mágica que já deveria ter sido abandonada há muito tempo. Que confiança pode ter alguém —a menos que seja algum aventureiro da especulação— num país dominado por malucos, pistoleiros e destruidores do meio ambiente?

And to think all religions start from worshipping the sun. 


. This is the sun. As far back as 10,000 B.C., history is abundant with carvings and writings reflecting people’s respect and adoration for this object.
Numerous artifacts prove these points, such as from the sun-worshipping cultures of the Egyptians, Indians, Babylonians and Greeks, among many others, including the peoples of the Levant and ancient Israel. Concerning the antiquity of sun worship, UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador Dr. Madanjeet Singh relates:
The tool-making hominids, as anthropologists call them, emerged about one-and-a-half million
years ago. But the sun‘s identification with the animals they hunted became evident much later as
in the striking circular engravings representing the sun, discovered in the Central Asian regions
(thirteenth millennium BC) in Siberia and western Turkistan. They seem to have eventually
influenced the earliest artifacts made in Iran and Mesopotamia... Apart from the animals depicted
in the Lascaux caves in France, at Altamira in Spain, at Adduara in Sicily (15,000 to 10,000 BC),
and at the prehistoric Tassili N‘Ajjer in the Sahara region (7000 to 4000 BC), are also strange
human figures such as the dancing man with horns on his head and a stallion tail, as in the cave
paintings at Trois Frères in Ariège. These are comparable to similar figures seen on the third-
millennium-BC Mohenjo-daro seals found in the Indus Valley—symbols that are identified with the

This solar religion continued for millennia, well into the common or ―Christian‖ era. As stated by Dr. Lee I.A. Levine, a professor at the Jewish Theological Seminary:
On the religious plane, belief in the supremacy of the sun god was widespread. The cult of Mithra, as well as other Oriental cults in the late Roman era, identified the supreme deity with the sun. In fact, the tendency in Late Antiquity to unify the creeds allowed [the Greek sun god] Helios to be identified in many circles as the highest deity. On an intellectual level, Neoplatonic thought throughout these centuries likewise addressed the centrality of the sun... Closer to Palestine, sun- worship is amply attested...in Palmyra, among the Essenes, in Nabataea, as well as on a plethora

In the late Roman era, the figure of Helios, or Sol Invictus, occupied a central role in a variety of settings, from the Imperial circles of Rome to the eastern provinces... Throughout the Greco- Roman period generally, and especially in the first centuries of the Common Era, the cult of this

Sun worship persists to this day, as described in Dr. Singh‘s The Sun: Symbol of Power and Life, an extensive survey with many images of solar religious traditions and iconography from the earliest periods into the modern era.

&gt; If there is no trade deal there will be a border or you could just transport forbidden goods.

Even if there is a trade deal, there needs to be a border because regulatory and customs checks happen regardless of trade deals. To remove the border, you would need a customs union and full regulatory alignment (essentially, staying in the EU customs union and the single market). The UK has made it very clear that it doesn't want that (but has long retained a rather cavalier attitude about the consequences of that decision).

Due to the WA, the border will be implemented in the Irish sea (or rather the UK ports on the UK side of it) and Northern Ireland will, for all intends and purposes, remain in the single market with a few special provisions for goods meant for local consumption.

My only point is that ""no deal"" used to mean ""no withdrawal agreement"" (which implies no trade deal because the EU would never sign one without agreement on outstanding issues) and what is currently meant by ""no deal"" is ""no trade deal"".

We (the US and Europe over the course of 200yrs) knowingly and intentionally created, funded and protected Wahhabism (the satanic offshoot of Islam that has given birth to groups like Hamas, ISIS, Al Queda and almost all the others). 

We knowingly and intentionally instigated and funded sectarian conflicts and tribal conflicts and successfully got the whole region to be at each other’s throats THEEEEN we turn around and say: “oh they’ve always been like this there’s no hope for them” like WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK... not only does it dehumanize Arabs and vilify Islam but it is also factually incorrect and that’s the most frustrating part of it.

Solang du nicht in Geld schwimmst oder professionell Sport auf deinem Fahrrad machen willst, ist ein gebrauchtes immer die richtige Entscheidung, würd ich sagen.

[https://www.bergfreunde.eu/bike-frame-size-calculator/](https://www.bergfreunde.eu/bike-frame-size-calculator/) da kannst du deine Schritthöhe eingeben und kriegst eine daumenmalpi Vermutung, was eine gute Rahmengröße für dich ist. (zum Stadtradfahren völlig ausreichend)

Vielleicht bist du schonmal Citybike gefahren, dann weißt du, dass die 3-Gänge haben, was völlig ausreichend ist fürs Stadtrad. (gibt auch singlespeeds/fixies, die mit sog. ""magic gear"" ein gutes Übersetzungsverhältnis haben, d.h. Steigungen sind möglich und auf der Ebene kann man noch halbwegs schnell fahren). Vorteil von weniger Gängen ist Gewichtersparnis - ein klassischer, älterer MTB-Antrieb mit 3 Ringen vorne und 7 hinten wär ziemlich übertrieben, ist aber im Grunde überhaupt kein Problem und Geschmackssache.

Am allerwichtigsten ist bei der Inspektion, dass du den Rahmen auf Risse/Beschädigungen/Rost kontrollierst (vorallem die unterseite der Rohre, die zur Straße schauen wegen Steinschlag). Dann schau, dass der Sattel nicht feststeckt, die Felgen nicht eiern. Wenn du dir ein Rad mit Felgenbremsen kaufst (definitiv zu empfehlen), kannst du entlang der Felge, wo der Bremsbelag die Felge berührt, mit dem Finger entlangfahren. Je eingekerbter, u-förmiger das ist, desto abgenutzter ist die Felge. Abnutzung der Zahnräder des Antriebs kannst du neben Betrachtung der einzelnen Zähne und ihrer Abnutzung (Achtung, sind meistens dreckig und schaun schlimmer aus, als es ist, du suchst nach Materialverformung/starker Materialabrieb) so feststellen, dass du die Kette beim vorderen, großen Ring vom Ring wegziehst und schaust, wie weit du sie ziehen kannst. (Ketten leiern sich mit der Zeit immer mehr aus, und ab einer gewissen Länge ist das schlecht für die Zahnräder, wenn man dann lange damit fährt, nutzen die sich ab und dann ist ein ziemlich teurer Komponent des Fahrrads reif für den Müll.) Schau, ob Umwerfer (falls vorhanden, das Ding das vorne die Kette auf ein anderes Kettenblatt umwirft) und Schaltwerk (das Ding hinten, dass dasselbe macht) nicht kaputt, verbogen sind, wenns nicht komplett einwandfrei schaltet, kann das auch an schlechter Einstellung liegen, muss nicht zwingend bedeuten, dass die kaputt sind. (aber je mehr funktioniert von vornherein, desto besser)

Der Rest kann relativ zu diesen primären Punkten kostengünstig neu eingestellt und erneuert werden (z.B. Schaltungeinstellen, Reifen, Bremsen/Bremsbeläge, Bremskabeln)

Ich würd dir für die Stadt einen Rennrad - Stahlrahmen empfehlen, bissi schwerer als Aluminium, fährt sich aber angenehmer, außer du findest so ein neueres Trekkingrad mit Federgabel (die Dämpfer vorne) und dir taugt sowas (wiegt mehr als starre Gabel). Kommt auch drauf an, ob du vllt irgendwann einen Gepäckträger montieren willst, das geht auf älteren Rennrädern eher schwerer. Mein Herumgurker, Arbeitsstute und Vorstellung von Idealfahrrad ist ein 26inch Stahlrahmen MTB mit starrer Gabel, Flatbar und dünneren Slickreifen, leider noch mit 3x vorne, aber das wird hoffentlich bald geändert. :3

Und zu guter Letzt, aber eigentlich am wichtigsten, ist, dass du drauf fährst und schaust, ob dir das Gefühl auf dem Fahrrad taugt. :)

Bin ein extremst schlechter Fahrradmechaniker, also hoffentlich melden sich noch Leute, die dir genauer erklären können wie man z.B. Abnutzung vom Antrieb feststellt usw.

Full disclosure, I do not or never have worked for IKEA but I have studied their supply chain and set-up a while ago (some of this may not be up-to-date). This may or may not ease your frustration…I am not defending IKEA by any means, just trying to shed some light on the situation.   
 

It can be suggested that IKEA has been late to the e-commerce game and this was admitted by a former CEO Peter Angefjäll in an annual report so it's been a game of catch-up to change a well-oiled flat pack empire, with the emphasis on you the customer doing the last mile.  
 

There are two major types of distribution flow that IKEA has created for itself. Direct delivery from the supplier to the store(s) or from a supplier to a DC and then to a store - what product goes in what flow depends on what it is.   
 

If it's something that has a high turnover then it will mostly likely be sent directly to the store (this is where the driver shortage and supply chain disruptions come in, most famously pre-corona it was the port problems on the East and West Coast of the US. A container would come in and then be stuck in a queue until a truck could come and pick it up and deliver it to the store.   
 

If it's low turnover it will sit in a DC and be sent to a store when needed, typically kitchens, appliances. Now, the stores themselves work on JIT with little actual warehouse space of their own. Where you pick up the furniture as a customer is effectively the warehouse. They are also optimised to hold a certain amount of articles…I think it’s 9000 permanent ones (as in SKUs and then there’s local variations so it pushes it up to about 12 000). In theory, high, predictable volumes mean that with planning, a solid supplier base you could have a store refilled from the supplier the night before. 

So in order to make something of the shift to e-commerce the self-serve area in the store where you pick up items is also the same stock that gets sent out to you as a customer if you order online. Then you could argue that if the store is closed and no-one is visiting then the store just becomes a DC. In the US this may not be so easy because as you’re aware the ratio of stores close enough to people is actually quite low compared to Europe, I have read that some people need to travel 4 hours one way to get to their nearest store. However, LOTS more people have the internet and the geographical reach is thus greater…so, yep order shock etc. Combined with this, the market hall in a store with all your bedding, cookware etc is ALSO part of the e-commerce stock so you’re actually taking stock from the shop floor and sending it out. 

Also, the DCs themselves aren’t designed to send stock directly to a customer (sounds a bit odd because a DC can be changed to however you want in theory). In order to try and solve this is the creation of e-commerce DCs with a more diverse range of items, smaller ones etc but these are few and far between, the only one I’m aware of is in place called Torsvik in Sweden. Ingvar famously said that to keep costs low every part of the container should be filled so you don’t transport air. But if you order 16 mugs, a few towels, a sofa and some plants then you have a lot of air and packaging that works in a store layout and to be carried home by you and not via a box in a FedEx truck. 

The store itself is an old concept and will become even more so in the future. You will probably seem them becoming mini DCs in order to make up for the fact that people just won’t want to pay a visit. 

So in short, IKEA is still not as nimble as the likes of Amazon or other retailers because the logistics is optimised still for the store.",True,False,False,,,,0,1593616021,,False,0,{},fwl8gc3,False,t3_hioh85,False,False,t3_hioh85,/r/IKEA/comments/hioh85/whats_really_going_on_with_ikeas_online/fwl8gc3/,False,,1602205416,6,True,False,IKEA,t5_2s9a5,r/IKEA,public,,0,[],

&gt; Segundo a ministra de Estado e da Presidência, Mariana Vieira da Silva, o objetivo é perceber aspetos como a forma de propagação deste discurso nas plataformas ‘online’, **as mensagens que contém, identificar autores**, monitorizar processos de queixas, entre outros aspetos.

&gt; O Governo foi ainda questionado sobre o inquérito à origem etnicorracial dos portugueses que o Instituto Nacional de Estatística (INE) pretende desenvolver, um tema polémico depois de ter sido recusada a inclusão de uma pergunta nesse sentido nos censos de 2021, **tendo a ministra referido que o INE está agora a trabalhar na identificação dos recursos necessários para que o inquérito possa avançar em 2021 ou 2022**.

A comunidade cigana não vai ficar contente com este ultimo, tendo em conta que foi pelo seu representante que a ideia de aplicar isto nos Census não foi aplicada, tendo até levado a SOS Racismo, que era a favor, a ser afectada pela decisão.

Quanto ao resto, só posso esperar para ver como é que isto será aplicado mas tenho questões sobre o que é que **um governo** vai considerar como discurso de ódio. Porque seguindo certas [**coisas**](https://old.reddit.com/r/portugal/comments/hgqqo9/european_social_survey_62_dos_portugueses/fw5p9pm/), vai ser interessante ver que medidas de controlo e censura podem resultar daqui. Porque vão resultar, isso nem é exactamente uma questão, só depende da interpretação que **o governo** irá ter. Se for a mesma linha da União Europeia, será interessante.

Por mera curiosidade, o que é que a malta de esquerda pensa disto? Eu sei que alguns já batem palminhas quanto a controlar e perseguir fachos, tudo certo com isso porque é o esperado. Mas, com 3 passos atrás e a ver a pintura geral, o que pensam desta ferramenta de identificação de conteúdo nas mãos de um Estado? E digo Estado porque o PS não vai governar para sempre.

Quer dizer, o tal inquérito étnico não passa porque uma comunidade das minorias tem preocupações sobre como esses dados podem ser usados nas mãos de um governo de Direita, segundo as fontes naquela altura. Mas esta ferramenta que irá englobar conteúdo de toda a gente, online, já não preocupa? Espero que preocupe.

I think it’s because people at one point were trying to use it to make dawah, but didn’t think twice about the implications. Frankly, I think that is the unfortunate consequence of many da’ees not having a thorough enough background in the sciences. Thus, many jumped to using science to appeal to some modern day folk. However, now they’re perhaps recognizing it may not be the best approach? 

Using science to confirm the Qur’an is the same as using a manmade and inherently prone-to-error method to prove a text that is from God and is perfect. Yes, it is our belief that it is from God and that it is perfect. However, when we do choose to believe in the Qur’an, it should be based on what the Qur’an says, not on what man says about what’s in the Qur’an. That’s common sense. Before major scientific discoveries of the modern world, people still believed in the Qur’an. They didn’t need to know all the modern day ideas expressed by the scientific community. 

If you study the history of science in Islam, you’ll notice that Muslim thinkers, scholars, and scientists always used the Qur’an to understand reality and the world, and didn’t try to use their observation of the world to dictate their belief in the Qur’an. Yet, they were often hundred of years ahead of their European inheritors. Read books like “Islamic Science and the Making of the European Renaissance” by George Saliba. You’ll see that modern day scientific thinking owes much of itself to Islamic thinkers.

This is not to vilify science or suggest that it is not good. In fact, science is neither morally good nor bad, it is merely a methodology. This methodology isn’t a set of laws of the world, it serves to help humans understand laws of the world. It doesn’t help us understand those laws perfectly always. Sometimes we are fortunate enough to find some laws in nature that are consistent. However, we always continue to discover that our previous assumptions about the world aren’t exactly correct. Thus, science as a field is under constant modification. Should we use a constantly modifying chain of thought to judge the validity of book from God? No. We can use it to help increase us in faith, but not make it the foundation of our faith. 

You can see that what the Qur’an says about the universe and other facts of nature are correct, but sometimes scientists come up with alternate ideas that they think are correct. Take the evolution of man for example. The Qur’an and evolutionary science as a field are in disagreement over how modern humans came to be. Thus, if one is to say “science can be found in the Qur’an always and that’s why I believe in it”, they’d be lying. Much of modern science agrees with the Qur’an, but not all of it.

Science is not law- it helps us discover laws. However, since it is developed entirely by our flawed, inconsistent, and severely limited abilities of observation, it is many times flawed, inconsistent, and severely limited. What we know about reality is less than a drop, and what we don’t know is more vast than all the oceans on the earth. You can’t use such limited assumptions about reality, no matter how many times you validate it, as a foundation of your faith. It should rather be used a confirmation of your faith. Whatever “science” you want to use to believe in the Qur’an should be understood in the way the Qur’an wants you to understand it. Meaning, if we take the idea that the universe is expanding, which is referenced in the Qur’an according to some or many interpretations, then we should believe that it is. We can then look at the concept of universe’s expansion discovered by Hubble and say “the Qur’an agrees with this according to my observation, so it must be correct.” In this case, the Qur’an confirms your reality first, and then reality in turns agrees with what you read in the Qur’an. Thus, the science could have helped you increase in faith, not made you develop faith from scratch. Now, when we look at the idea of the evolution of man from lesser apes according to science, and we see that the Qur’an disagrees- we shouldn’t try to mold what the Qur’an says to fit science. Instead, we confirm our disagreement with the idea of evolution of man from lesser ape, and agree with the Qur’an. We don’t suddenly disbelieve in the Qur’an. We confirm that God knows best and that man’s knowledge on the origin of man is incomplete. 

God always tells us to observe the universe around us as having proofs for His existence and power. We should do that as God wants us to, but not be so arrogant to assume that we know what’s best about the universe.

But to offer a perspective.  I think these thing operate on a spectrum and not a binary.  I think its easier to justify a right of return for people who often had a living relative who lived in Palestine, or have photos and other memorbilia including property deeds,  and who currently live in refugee camps as a direct result of the displacement.

Its harder for a group of Europeans who had no real material connection to the area outside of religious text for two millenia.

Racism and sexism exist in every sector. They manifest differently in tech than on other sectors, but are hardly unique to tech. 

As for overworking, I hear this a lot, and i know some places like EA are famous for abusing it, but at the places I’ve worked, it’s more individuals choosing to work more hours than any insititutional demand for it. I think a big part of it is the reality that some people can do more in 10 hours than other people can do in 50. Those rare, highly efficient people don’t need to work insane hours (though some still do), but the less efficient/productive ones might feel a need to work insane hours to feel like they’re meeting expectations.

This organization also conveniently sidesteps the fact that honey bees are direct competitors of native bees and are in fact one of the pressures threatening them.

People have to eat, but that doesn’t mean agriculture is conservation. No one would think that donating to corn and soybean production saves endangered plants.

A single heavy tank (or tank destroyer since it is cheaper) contributes to armor (formula is 30% or 40% of the highest unit plus 70% to 60% of the average) Inability to pierce the target means the target does 50% more org damage and takes 50% less.

Om te antwoorden op:

&gt;Ik denk dat als je de resultaten net buiten de multiculturele steden bekijkt, dat je het antwoord krijgt.

De regio Leuven en Mechelen en omliggende gemeentes hebben ongeveer een gelijkende trend, nl vooral liberaal en socialistisch met een beetje Groen. Al valt het op dat in de landelijke dorpen (e.g. Haacht, of Kampenhout) NVA en CDV een beetje hogere percentages neertellen, maar ik denk niet dat dit ook maar enig statistisch bewijs is. Vooral aangezien dorpen sowieso al vaker centrum of centrum rechts stemmen tegenover steden. Dit was ook al zo voor migrantenstemrecht.

Dus zeggen dat migranten (niet-EU) een grote bijdrage leveren aan bepaalde partijen grenst mijns inziens aan het statistisch onwaarschijnlijke. aka. mochten migranten niet meestemmen zou de percentages voor centrum-rechts een beetje hoger zijn, maar extreem breed zou het verschil waarschijnlijk niet zijn.

Yes, both are interested in not being a part of the EU. However, I find that for Swiss this is often stated in terms of a desire to keep the representational democracy, monetary independence (stability .. banking .. a few themes there), and similar themes. It's more of a ""things aren't broken, let's not fix them"" sort of mindset, coupled with a difference of opinion on what a democracy can and ought to look like. It also does not seem like a very controversial point of view here, perhaps because it is the status quo. It is a conservative stance, however, in the traditional meaning of that word (as opposed to the modern political stance that shares that word in name).

In Britain, most people would actually like to be part of the EU now, and it was even pretty close when the vote was taken. Aside from that difference, for those who are in favor of Brexit (then or now) it is far more about ""things are broken, we need to fix them"". There is a much bigger emphasis on the more xenophobic topics (not saying this doesn't exist at all in Switzerland; it is are found everywhere there are large numbers of people), and a far more confused and confusing take on the economic realities in their country. They had a good handle on their own currency, so that isn't *really* a big part of it; if anything Brexit was (correctly) seen as a risk to their business dealings and currency stability (which is why there was so much ""no, no.. it'll be fine!"" from the Brexit leadership on the topic of economic impact). Their democracy is pretty crap (the parliamentary system is not optimal; first-past-the-post is ridiculous; a constitutional monarchy is not exactly cutting edge governance; etc.) and it wasn't under threat anyways. Much of the push to leave the EU was because of concern over things not going well enough, not a fear that things would get worse if they didn't.

It is a conservative perspective in Britain that pushes Brexit, this is true, but it is modern political ""conservatism"".

Yes, they should.   Stagflation is incredibly rare, if it happens that's why we have politicians to enact sensible laws when the unexpected occurs.

&gt; France, which has received little public support from NATO allies in its escalating conflict with Turkey, is making its return to Operation Sea Guardian conditional on four demands: that NATO allies reaffirm their commitment to the arms embargo; outlaw the use of NATO call signs when ships are on national operations; improve coordination between Sea Guardian and the EU Operation IRINI; and the setting up of a mechanism to defuse conflict and avoid incidents among allies.

&gt; On June 10, the French frigate Le Courbet, operating under NATO command, attempted to inquire about the intended destination of a Tanzanian-flagged cargo ship, the Cirkin, but was aggressively barred from doing so by three Turkish naval ships escorting the Cirkin, according to French officials.

&gt; On June 17 and 18, French Defense Minister Florence Parly lodged a complaint at a NATO ministerial meeting and only got the support of eight allies out of a total of 30, for its criticism of Turkey&amp;#039;s behavior.

Transportation of electricity is hardly an unsolved problem.

Nuclear has a large upfront cost compared to gas power plants, and even those are partly being closed down and replaced by huge power storage units (yes, batteries!) for solar... That's why it's not being invested in right now.

Despite what many tout around, renewables are very reliable on the scale of something like the US, EU or China. There are wind streams that don't ever just stop, wave power is a constant and solar is insanely predictable and has the power output at the time where consumption matters. It's also all incredibly cheap and a fast ROI.

&gt; Voor de gemeenteverkiezingen van 2018 (redelijk representatief denk ik) liggen de percentages stemmers van niet-EU afkomst in Vlaanderen op 6,23% en in Bxl op 12,85%. Aangezien deze ook divers stemmen vaak (als in vooral links (dat 3 partijen bevat) en centrum (VLD) en heel soms zelfs centrum-rechts (NVA)) zou ik me serieuze vragen stellen bij deze extrapolaties.  
  
niet akkoord; dit zijn *niet-Belgen* in gemeenteraadsverkiezingen.  
Ik heb het zeker ook over het federale &amp; Vlaamse niveau; en dus over 'allochtone' en 'autochtone' Belgen.  
Dat aandeel zit op iets boven de 20%, in Vlaanderen (&amp; idem België)  
  
denk-experiment:  
stel:  
Groen &amp; SPA, halen beide ong 12% van de stemmen.  
een 'allochtoon', is 2x zo waarschijnlijk om Groen/SPA te stemmen, als een 'autochtoon'. (dit is absoluut een stelling; ik heb hier geen cijfers voor; het stemgeheim blijft behouden en dat is maar goed ook vanuit democratisch standpunt).  
Dan is: 12% = 80% x Y + 20% x 2 Y.  
gevraagd: Y.  
12% = 120% Y.  
Y = 10%.  
  
Dit is nog een kleine afwijking.. maar we weten gewoon niet wat % allochtonen op Groen &amp; SPA stemmen.  
Toch: 12% -&gt; 10%, dat is 1/6de minder. Naar zetels toe kan dat al een verschil opleveren.

Vooral aangezien dorpen sowieso al vaker centrum of centrum rechts stemmen tegenover steden. Dit was ook al zo voor migrantenstemrecht.

La 14 ani, in toiul lui ianuarie, am ieșit pe la 19 afara sa-mi plimb câinele. Cand m-am întors si am intrat in bloc, un nene care s-io dadea viguros a intrat dupa mine. Am luat-o repede la goană pe scari sa intru in apartament si i-am spus tatei ce s-a întâmplat, dar chiar daca el a ieșit imediat (nici nu și-a luat geaca pe el, iarna) nu l-a mai găsit pe tip.

A doua oara aveam 15 ani, si era prin martie. Eu stăteam in autobuz pe scaun (langa usa, unde sunt panouri de sticla în fata scaunelor). In fata mea, rezemat de spatele autobuzului, statea un nene la vreo 65 de ani. Pe la jumatea călătoriei, imi îndrept privirea catre el si il vad cu trompeta scoasă. M-am uitat in ochii lui încercând sa-mi comunic dezgustul, dar nimic, nenea chiar si îndreptat trompeta si mai înspre mine. Autobuzul era plin de lume dar nimeni nu zicea nici pâs, si as fi făcut scandal dar am citit ca la astia daca le zici ceva numai le dai apa la moara (au ceva fetișuri dubioase cu a fi certați, dracu știe), asa ca am sărit de pe scaun si am fugit im capătul opus al autobuzului, ca sa nu ma vada cand cobor.

&gt; **Gut:** The coronavirus infects cells that line the inside of the large and small intestine, called gut enterocytes. That likely accounts for the **diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain that about one-third of Covid-19 patients experience**, said MD Anderson’s Maitra: “The GI symptoms reflect physiological [dysfunction] of cells of the lower GI tract.”
&gt;
&gt; **Kidney:** The cells lining the tubules that filter out toxic compounds from the blood are rife with ACE2 receptors. Last month, scientists studying **1,000 Covid-19 patients at a New York City hospital reported that 78% of those in intensive care developed acute kidney injury.**
&gt;
&gt; **Smell:** An analysis of 24 studies with data from 8,438 Covid-19 patients from 13 countries found this month that **41% had lost their sense of taste or smell, or both.** That shouldn’t be surprising, said Fabio Ferreli of Humanitas University in Milan: “Perhaps the highest levels of ACE2 receptors are expressed in cells in the nasal epithelium.” The sensory loss isn’t due to nasal inflammation, swelling, or congestion, he said, “but to direct damage” to these epithelial cells. Loss of smell also impacts taste, but the virus may also have a direct effect on taste: The nference analysis found high levels of the ACE2 gene in tongue cells called keratinocytes, which contribute to the sense of taste.
&gt; 
&gt; **Lungs:** This is where a respiratory virus should strike, and SARS-CoV-2 does. The lungs’ type II alveolar cells — among other jobs, they release a compound that allows the lungs to pass oxygen to the blood and take carbon dioxide from it — are studded with ACE2 receptors. **Once infected with the coronavirus, they become dysfunctional or die, and are so swarmed by immune cells that this inflammatory response can explode into the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that strikes many patients with severe Covid-19**, Walensky said.
&gt; 
&gt; **Pancreas:** In April, scientists in China reported that there was higher expression of the gene for ACE2 in the pancreas than in the lungs. Genetic data are an indirect measure of ACE2 receptors themselves, but could have been a tip-off to physicians to monitor patients for symptoms there. As it happens, the Chinese researchers also **found blood markers for pancreas damage in Covid-19 patients, including in about 17% of those with severe disease.**
&gt;
&gt; **Heart:** **Patients with severe Covid-19 have a high incidence of cardiac arrests and arrhythmias**, scientists at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania recently found. That’s **likely due to an extreme inflammatory response, but there might be more direct effects of the coronavirus, too**. A large team of European researchers reported in April that arrhythmia (including atrial fibrillation), heart injury, and even heart failure and pulmonary embolism might reflect the fact that ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in cells along the inside walls of capillaries. When these “vascular endothelial” cells become infected, **the resulting damage can cause clots**, MGH’s Walensky said, which in turn **can cause Covid toe, strokes, and ischemic bowel** (too little blood flow to the gut). Studies from around the world suggest that **7% to 31% of Covid-19 patients experience some sort of cardiac injury**.
&gt;
&gt; **Gallbladder:** Specialized cells in this organ, too, have high levels of ACE2 receptors. **Damage to the gallbladder (like the pancreas) can cause digestive symptoms.**",True,False,False,,,,0,1593628595,,False,0,{},fwlz817,False,t3_hjfyvy,False,False,t3_hjfyvy,/r/Coronavirus/comments/hjfyvy/not_just_the_lungs_covid19_attacks_like_no_other/fwlz817/,False,,1602219046,190,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],

&gt;  
&gt;The  U.S. government announced Monday that it had an agreement with Gilead  Sciences to make the bulk of their production of remdesivir available to  Americans during the next three months. The Department of Health and  Human Services said it had secured 500,000 treatments of the drug  through September, representing 100% of Gilead’s July production  capacity and 90% of its capacity in August and September.  
&gt;  
&gt;“To  the extent possible, we want to ensure that any American patient who  needs remdesivir can get it,” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex  Azar said in a statement.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ohid Yaqub, a senior lecturer at the University of Sussex, called the U.S. agreement “disappointing news.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“It so clearly signals an unwillingness to cooperate with other countries  and the chilling effect this has on international agreements about  intellectual property rights,” Yaqub said in a statement  
&gt;  
&gt;Until now, Gilead had donated treatment courses to the U.S. and other  countries. That ended Tuesday and Gilead this week announced the price  of the treatment going forward. In 127 poor or middle-income countries,  Gilead is allowing generic makers to supply the drug.  
&gt;  
&gt;In  a statement Wednesday, the California-based Gilead said its agreement  with the U.S. allows for unneeded supplies to be sent to other  countries. The company said it is “working as quickly as possible” to  enable access worldwide. But it noted that U.S. is seeing a significant  rise in COVID cases, while “most EU and other developed countries have  reduced their levels of disease considerably.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Early trials testing remdesivir in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 found  that those who received the drug recovered quicker than those who  didn’t. It is the only drug licensed by both the U.S. and the European  Union as a treatment for those with severe illness from the coronavirus.    
&gt;  
&gt;Dr. Peter  Horby, who is running a large study testing several treatments for  COVID-19, told the BBC that “a stronger framework” was needed to ensure  fair prices and access to key medicines for people and nations around  the world. He said that as an American company, Gilead was likely under  “certain political pressures locally.”   
&gt;  
&gt;British  Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman, James Slack, declined to  criticize the United States for the move, but said the U.K. had a  “sufficient stock” of remdesivir for patients who need it, but didn’t  specify how much that was.   
&gt;  
&gt;Thomas  Senderovitz, head of the Danish Medicines Agency, told Danish  broadcaster DR that the move could endanger Europeans and others down  the road.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I  have never seen anything like that. That a company chooses to sell their  stock to only one country. It’s very strange and quite inappropriate,”  he said. “Right now we have enough to make it through the summer if the  intake of patients is as it is now. If a second wave comes, we may be  challenged.”   
&gt;  
&gt;Gilead  had been developing remdesivir for years as a viral treatment, aided by  millions in funding from the U.S. government, before it was tried for  coronavirus. The company’s statement said that Gilead is exploring ways  to support access to remdesivir beyond the U.S. and the 127 developing  countries.  
&gt;  
&gt;Dr.  Penny Ward of King’s College London, noted that many countries have  legal provisions that allow them to prohibit the exportation of drugs to  other countries during an emergency.   
&gt;  
&gt;“It  is unreasonable to expect that the U.S. government should deny their  population access to drugs manufactured in the USA,” she said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ward  pointed out that another drug that has recently shown may help people  with severe COVID-19, the cheap steroid dexamathasone, is long  off-patent and available globally.  
&gt;  
&gt;The  U.S. has the worst coronavirus outbreak in the world, with 2.6 million  reported infected and 127,000 confirmed virus-related deaths, according  to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. To date, COVID-19 has sickened  more than 10.5 million people worldwide, killing around 512,000,  according Johns Hopkins.

First I think it's better to say ""Anti-PRC"" than ""anti-China"" because I don't think most people are really against the average Chinese people. The PRC hasn't been static with public opinion on it arbitrarily shifting. Their influence globally has been rising sharply the last decade with economic growth and the blatant anti-humanitarian and anti-democratic tendencies have been getting worse the longer Xi Jinping has been in office. 

It wasn't perfect, and arguably not aggressive enough, but there was a framework and a strategy for dealing with PRC influence internationally under Obama. We were more closely allied with a lot of European countries, more actively participated in multinational agreements/organizations and he was working towards the Trans Pacific Partnership. Trump made it a trade war and made it more us-against-them but the rise of PRC influence isn't a problem that he manufactured.

&gt;The Invention of the White Race

&gt;Groundbreaking analysis of the birth of racism in America.

&gt;When the first Africans arrived in Virginia in 1619, there were no “white” people, nor, according to colonial records, would there be for another sixty years. In his seminal two-volume work, The Invention of the White Race, Allen details the creation of the “white race” by the ruling class as a method of social control, in response to labor unrest precipitated by Bacon’s Rebellion. Distinguishing European Americans from African Americans within the laboring class, white privileges enforced the myth of the white race through the years and has been central to maintaining ruling-class domination over the entire working class.

&gt;Since publication in the mid-nineties, Invention has become indispensable in debates on the origins of racial oppression in America. Volume One utilizes Irish history to show the relativity of race and racial oppression as a form of social control. Volume Two details the development of racial oppression and racial slavery in colonial Virginia and, more broadly, Anglo-America. A new introduction by Jeffrey B.

O morador do Jardim Peri, na zona Norte de São Paulo, trabalhava como técnico de amostragem em um laboratório que decretou falência. Desempregado com duas filhas para sustentar, decidiu começar a trabalhar como motorista de [Uber](https://brasil.elpais.com/tag/uber). Financiou um carro em 60 meses e hoje chega a trabalhar até 16 horas por dia para pagar as contas no fim do mês. Desde então, nunca mais tirou férias. “É um serviço quase em tempo integral. Trabalho de domingo a domingo, só paro no rodízio do meu carro na quinta-feira. Ser Uber vale a pena, mas é preciso ralar muito para pagar o aluguel. Eu estou com várias contas atrasadas, no vermelho”, lamenta Silva.

Sem muitas alternativas de empregos formais em[ um cenário de lenta recuperação econômica](https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2019/12/03/economia/1575369338_271431.html), não são poucos os brasileiros que como Silva resolveram atuar como motorista por aplicativo, inclusive alugando carros para cumprir o ofício. O número de pessoas que trabalha em veículos, que também inclui taxistas, motoristas e trocadores de ônibus, atingiu recorde e aumentou 29,2% em 2018, chegando a 3,6 milhões. O que significa 810.000 pessoas a mais em relação a 2017, segundo a Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicílios Contínua (PNAD Contínua), divulgada em dezembro pelo IBGE.

Já os que trabalham em local designado pelo empregador, patrão ou freguês, grupo que inclui os entregadores a bordo de motos e bicicleta[, muitos recrutados por aplicativo](https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2019/08/06/politica/1565115205_330204.html), também registraram a maior alta desde 2012. O número desses trabalhadores avançou quase 10% em relação a 2017, chegando a 10,1 milhões em 2018. Em um ano, 905 mil pessoas optaram por esse tipo de emprego.

“As recentes altas podem estar relacionadas ao crescimento dos serviços de transportes de passageiros e de entregas por aplicativos de celular, refletindo as mudanças na economia atual”, afirmou a pesquisadora do IBGE, Adriana Beringuay.

Aos 23 anos, Mike Nunes Bizerra resolveu tentar ganhar a vida como entregador de aplicativo após ser demitido de um supermercado, onde era registrado. Há três meses, ele paga um plano de 20 reais para alugar as bicicletas do Itaú diariamente para fazer entregas em Pinheiros, na Zona Oeste da cidade. Morador de Itaquaquecetuba, na região metropolitana de São Paulo, ele precisa viajar duas horas de ônibus para chegar ao local. “Trabalho cinco dias por semana, do meio-dia até de noite. Ganho cerca de 400 reais por semana. No fim do mês, é algo parecido com o que recebia no supermercado, mas sem nenhum direito trabalhista”, diz.

Enquanto tenta procurar um emprego formal para ter mais estabilidade financeira para sustentar a mulher, que está desempregada, e as duas filhas, Bizerra torce sempre para que um dia chuvoso não atravesse o seu caminho. “Dia de chuva fico em casa e perco um dia de trabalho, não tem jeito”, lamenta. Em 2020, ele espera conseguir tirar uma habilitação para fazer as entregas de moto. “Vai facilitar um pouco o trabalho. É cada subida que pego, mas o melhor mesmo seria um emprego com carteira”.

Há mais de dois anos, o também entregador de aplicativo, Daniel Carlos César não consegue assinar sua carteira de trabalho. O último emprego registrado foi como repositor em um mercado. “Tive um acidente doméstico, machuquei a mão e não consegui completar nem os três meses de experiência”, conta o entregador que só conseguiu uma nova renda na informalidade.

Já a vendedora ambulante Maria Elenice Alves, de 62 anos, trabalha por conta própria há mais de 20 anos e, apesar de estar vendo suas vendas diminuírem nos últimos cinco anos, não pensa em mudar de ocupação. Com o marido desempregado há mais de um ano, sua preocupação é que não tem conseguido poupar quase nada para a aposentadoria.

Ainda que nos últimos dois trimestres a taxa de desemprego tenha registrado queda -no fim de novembro atingia 11,9 milhões de pessoas- e[ a taxa de ocupação tenha chegado ao recorde de 94,4 milhões de pessoas,](https://brasil.elpais.com/economia/2019-12-27/emprego-tem-leve-melhora-e-mais-vagas-com-carteira-assinada-mas-informais-superam-e-desafiam-recuperacao.html) o grande desafio continua sendo reduzir a informalidade do mercado de trabalho. Atualmente, 38,8 milhões de brasileiros estão dentro da categoria, cerca de 41%, incluindo os que trabalham por conta própria. A informalidade gera consequências negativas, segundo especialistas, como a renda menor para os trabalhadores por ser, em geral, ocupações que pagam menos e também uma queda da contribuição para a Previdência, já que são poucos os que contribuem para o INSS.

“Analisamos a evolução do ponto de vista qualitativo ou quantitativo?

I’m italian so i’m definitely off topic, but i read all your text, and it is definitely interesting. 

I think what you said can be enlargened to a europe vs north america discussion.

I live near a base used by americans at the feet of the alps and i lived in a lot of touristic places. I noticed that canadians and US people are generally enthusiastic, always say “sorry” and are generally “happy”. At the same time, they are more dramatic in some things. Body shaming, slut shaming or racism are treated in italy in a less dramatic way and given less importance, that is a chiller but careless attitude. Like: under frollo’s videos of the disney film, when he gropes esmeralda, in the english version “omg disney went so far!” Omg disgusting, pedophilia!”

The comments on the italian version were more like “frollo ruined everything for a bit of pussy” “frollo, jerk off and get a life!” Or “esmeralda looks like x politician”. This attitude is worse, but sometimes americans overdramatize everything, and it looks somehow connected to the fact that they always look enthusiastic.

Our humorism is darker also, that’s why some consider us “racist”, while we joke on everyone, included the next town. We are still different in bitterness tha the french though.

French characters in movies look more “existentialist”, like “i’m tired of life and i look it harmless” the video of je ne peux plus dire que je t’aime in “la guerre est declarè” exudes frenchness, even if the female protagonist has an italian surname and the guy a turkish one. They all feel the weight of life.  

But their sad and sarcastic characters are not bad, they are only lost. The italian ones in the italian comedy genre, with films like Il sorpasso in the past (the head of all road movies, easy rider’s director took from it) and perfetti sconosciuti in the present, the italian characters look like buffons, make laugh, but are teared down and vivisectioned in all their pettiness, they are monsters, capable of more wickedness, maybe because we suffered hunger in the past while the french didn’t. Alberto Sordi in I mostri represent perfectly the bitterness of the commedia all’italiana.

For the theoric thing i also guess it’s a southern/western europe vs anglosaxon countries.

Our high school are super theorical, in italy it is frequent to have greek and latin as subjects (translation and literature) for all five years and even uni is pretty theorical, with a lot of oral exams. This is good because we don’t study this thing to do that thing only, but is bad because we invest less in research. 

For the nationalism: i always think the french can be autocritical but not like the italians or greeks. We are older and it’s centuries that we are not a conquerer, while the french seem to feel somehow the missing of their recent napoleone’s era.

A lot of emphasis has been placed by historians and philologists on the linguistic effects of Luther’s translation of the Bible into vernacular German. The famous story, originally stated by Luther, is that he used the every-day German of the surrounding towns to create a Bible that could be read and understood by all Germans. For historians and philologists of the 19th and early 20th centuries, this lead to teleological arguments that Luther’s Bible created a definitive form of German that allowed Germans to digest the ‘Word of God’ and thereby further adopt Luther’s Saxon dialect as the standard. But the degree to which Luther’s translation influenced the creation of modern-day Hochdeutsch is not agreed on by historians. In fact, many have instead argued against the adoption of the Luther Bible as the most significant force in creating a more standardized German language. Other factors need to be considered, especially as a Low German Bible followed soon after Luther’s (translated from Luther’s Bible into Low German), thereby ensuring that the Hanseatic dialect (based in Lübeck) would also continue to propagate in the north. And there was considerable demand for bibles in Low German! By the end of 1525 there were 13 authorized translations (compared to 22 in High German) (187). 

So Luther’s Bible cannot be the sole reason for establishing a standardized German dialect, although it most certainly did play a part. Another area given more attention by historians and linguists is the development of imperial chancelleries. The Habsburgs used das gemeine Deutsch, a dialect of western Upper Germany (around Swabia), as their chancellery language in the 1500s. Therefore, starting from Maximilian I, all Habsburg lands from the Netherlands, Burgundy, Württemburg (until Duke Ulrich was reinstalled through French funds), and Austria used das gemeine Deutsch as the language of edicts, laws, and reports (52). But what about electoral Saxony, the land where Luther was protected after the Reichstag of Worms in 1521? 

Another chancellery language developed in Saxony (Meissen). This Meissen chancellery was adopted by Mainz, and came to be used as the language of Imperial decrees and laws (Reichsabschied). This is significant as the Meissen chancellery would continue to be used as the language of the Reich until 1806 (when the Reich ceased to exist). This language continued to spread across the north for administration functions. Again, quoting from Whaley: “It was the Meissen style, too, that soon after 1500 was gradually adopted by chancelleries further north, starting with Brandenburg, and which thus contributed significantly to the long-term decline of Low German as a written language of administration” (53). Low German would continue to be used, especially in the Hansestädte for commerce, centuries after adoption of Meissen chancellery language. Whaley also carefully states that by 1550 the decline of Low German could not be considered as inevitable. 

Now all of this was just to say: Luther’s Bible was not so significant in “standardizing” language across the Reich as many had been led to believe! So far, all of this is to argue contrary (although please correct me if my interpretation was wrong!) about what you said: “I never understood why that was the case, considering the Northern cities adopted Luther's and in those days the Northern standards seem to have been extremely similar to the Dutch ones - people in the North had to learn Standard German almost as a foreign language for hundreds of years until Low German dialects became rare.”
As I hope to have shown, the Northern lands did adopt Luther’s translation from Greek and parts of the Old Testament, but 13 variations of Low German bibles printed show they did not adopt Luther’s German dialect. The adoption of Luther’s translation happened for the Dutch in this time as well (in that Luther’s German was translated into Dutch). It was not until 1637 a Dutch Bible (Statenbijbel) was printed based on a new translation of the New Testament, not based on Luther.

Nevertheless, I would be careful in assigning a singular, definite point of separation. As maybe outside of the legal and inter-polity recognized independence in 1648, there were always gradations of separation (or integration) from the Reich. As I argued above, legal scholars and Nationalists in the 1830s - 1880s created the boundaries of Deutschland based on the centuries of historical debate about what the Reich (and Germany) were. The Netherlands were not significant in this tradition. But did the Dutch consider themselves separate as a result of this Bible? I am hesitant to agree with this. I would argue that their decades of practical independence through fighting the Habsburgs, Spanish, and Holy Roman Emperors from 1566 would be a much larger, formative experience from the peasantry to the numerous members of the estates general. The act of raising funds through privateering, securing trade routes, colonization, taxation, development of textile industries and shipbuilding, etc. (I would argue) led to greater systemic changes (and thus, greater cultural separation) in Dutch society than the publishing of the Statenbijbel itself. The Dutch Bible would have played a role to many, of varying grades of importance, in defining separation from the Germans, but it is difficult to evaluate a Dutch Bible (not to reduce the importance of the Bible for early modern Dutch people!) in comparison to the multitude of changes and factors that also affected the Dutch economically, politically, geographically, culturally, societally, etc.. 

I would argue against the publishing of the Statenbijbel as the moment of separation and, if pressed, make the claim that independence in 1648 was true the breaking point. Not purely due to recognition by numerous polities across Europe of independence, but rather the enormous changes the Dutch undertook for decades to gain independence from the Habsburgs and the Reich as well as the multitude of sacrifices made along the way.

&gt; You're of the mindset that it's better to not experience anything in order to spare yourself any potential negative feelings or outcomes, and complain about how ""oh woe is me I wish I wasnt alive"" rather than make the best out of your situation or just end it. You're a hypocrite.

That's not hypocritical; I have tried and failed, and will try again if I ever believe I have a chance at succeeding. You're confused because you take the naive view that a person's nature is one monolithic, atomic thing. Rather, all of us are a compound of at least two (and maybe multiple) conflicting drives. In Schopenhauer's ontology, he pits the part of us that is Will against the part that is Reason. In von Hartmann's, we have the interests of the Unconscious pitted against our own. In the case of both Schopenhauer's Will and von Hartmann's Unconscious, it is in their interest that we continue to live and ours (as rational individuals) that we die. In the Katha Upanishad - a scripture that forms a core part of Hinduism - the idea of the duality of our nature is restated in several forms: Will vs Desire, Shreya vs. Preya, higher mind vs. lower mind, etc. We also see it in literature, like in Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.

Empirically speaking, this duality of our nature is down to the fact that evolution favours genes that produce ""evolutionarily fit"" individuals, which includes genes that irrationally predispose us to want to survive and reproduce. A gene (or set of genes) that predispose us to believe ""life is good"" despite any evidence to the contrary will be selected for and become dominant within the gene pool. This is why the opinion that life is good is a natural, instinctively formed one. It is when we try to reflect on things like life or having children that we may find logic says one thing, while our instincts say another. In this case, our conflicting drives are revealed. Even though a person might rationally want to die, they have to contend with another part of them that forces them to live. And yet an outsider is blind to these conflicting forces and so whenever we see someone behave a certain way, we imagine that ""they"" have chosen to act that way, even if the part of them that constitutes their genuine, rational self is acting as a slave to the aspect of them that craves continued life at any cost - a craving that is common to every single form of life on this planet that has any semblance of consciousness at all, and is therefore very much *not* representative of the individual.

The reason that you likely haven't understood this yet is because you haven't reflected much on life yourself - you've just gone ahead and lived it (in a way that's enviable). On account of this, most of your beliefs will be those you have inherited from instinct, and the compound nature of your individuality will not be evident.

---

&gt; I'm in the same boat. I truly believe humans have no inherent purpose on earth, I especially believe my life holds no value outside of familial relations. The difference is, rather than wallow in self pity and brood about it, I work towards something akin to a purpose for myself.

Right, existentialism. There's no objective point to life, so just make one for yourself. I don't fault you for that. If it makes your time here happier, all power to you.

&gt; And, if I should so choose to have a child or two, pass on my knowledge to them to see what they can make of it, for better or worse.

See, this is the problematic part. You and I are alive, there's not much we can do about that, so we might as well make the best of it. But that doesn't mean we need to drag others into this world. I know that no amount of argument will convince you that having kids is wrong on purely philosophical grounds. If you want to have kids, you'll just block out everything I'll say and have forgotten it all tomorrow.

Bear in mind, though, that we live in a relatively interesting time. Maybe you can look at the life you have now, imagine your children having similar lives and believe that's a fair deal for them. The thing is, their lives will probably be substantially worse than yours. This world is falling apart due to human-induced climate change. We've had 420 consecutive months where the global temperature was above the 20th-century average. We're seeing temperatures of nearly 40C (104F) in Siberia and the Arctic. By the time your future children are adults, the Arctic ice cap will no longer exist. Warming oceans will cause more frequent and intense storms and lead to increased occurrences of flooding and drought. Southern Europe will begin to desertify; central Africa will turn from savannah to hyper-arid desert. Crop yields will fall, and crops themselves will become less nutritious. Locust swarms and other pests will become increasingly problematic, as we've already witnessed this year. Insects and bees will continue to die out.

You would be making the choice to bring your children into this increasingly uninhabitable world. Even people who share the same general worldview as you, who are happy enough with their own life, are choosing not to have children out of consideration for the lives they might have. How do you justify it to yourself? Do you believe we're going to fix these problems, despite not having made a dent in the past 50 years of climate scientists warning us about this? Or do you just not really care and want to have kids to please yourself, no matter how damned they are?

---

&gt; You can actually use this as fuel in order to change yourself and add meaning to your worthless life, like many are trying to do whether they realize it or not.
&gt;
&gt; Or you can continue to sit and brood and hate the world and the concept of continuing the human race while doing nothing to pursue your thoughts for change them.

Why do you believe these are mutually exclusive? A person can make active changes and improvements in their life, bettering themselves, and still believe that the world is better off never having been. Do you not understand that many of the people who held these views have gone on to have a greater impact on the world than you or I will ever have? Do you not grasp that this isn't a worldview that a few jaded individuals hold, but is the foundation of major world religions like Hinduism and Buddhism, that paint this earthly life as an *objectively bad thing* and attempt to point the way towards salvation towards it?

&gt; If you want a safe compass to guide you through life, and to banish all doubt as to the right way of looking at it, you cannot do better than accustom yourself to regard this world as a penitentiary, a sort of a penal colony, or [Greek: ergastaerion] as the earliest philosopher called it. Amongst the Christian Fathers, Origen, with praiseworthy courage, took this view, which is further justified by certain objective theories of life. I refer, not to my own philosophy alone, but to the wisdom of all ages, as expressed in Brahmanism and Buddhism, and in the sayings of Greek philosophers like Empedocles and Pythagoras; as also by Cicero, in his remark that the wise men of old used to teach that we come into this world to pay the penalty of crime committed in another state of existence—a doctrine which formed part of the initiation into the mysteries. And Vanini—whom his contemporaries burned, finding that an easier task than to confute him—puts the same thing in a very forcible way. Man, he says, is so full of every kind of misery that, were it not repugnant to the Christian religion, I should venture to affirm that if evil spirits exist at all, they have posed into human form and are now atoning for their crimes. And true Christianity—using the word in its right sense—also regards our existence as the consequence of sin and error.",True,False,False,,,,0,1593632549,,False,0,{},fwm82ey,False,t3_hi437k,False,True,t1_fwllm4t,/r/NoahGetTheBoat/comments/hi437k/beyond_sad/fwm82ey/,False,,1602223331,1,True,False,NoahGetTheBoat,t5_117wt6,r/NoahGetTheBoat,public,,0,[],

Boulder, Colorado. I’m actually born and raised there so this might be a little biased :) I moved away with my family when I was about 13, but I visit every year. it’s famous for being right on the edge of the Rocky Mountains (perfect for hiking, white water rafting, camping, etc.), which are a beautiful backdrop for the city. Incredible food and craft beers galore, and there’s no shortage of things to do (including the states flagship university - CU Boulder). Colorado actually also has the lowest rate of obesity in America and some of the highest health stats around the country! Living in the city can be expensive but you can easily commute from any of the surrounding towns. It was also named the happiest city in the US in 2017. See also, Colorado Springs and Denver. 

Austin, Texas. This is the capitol of Texas and it’s really nothing like the rest of the state, it’s motto is even “keep Austin weird”! They’ve got a massive river running through the city that’s famous for paddle boarding, kayaking, and boating. They are also famous for food trucks and being the “live music capitol of the world”, and they have a strong academic game including UT Austin and St. Edwards University. North of Austin is also Southwestern University, the oldest university in Texas. See also, San Antonio. 

Santa Fe, New Mexico. This is a wonderful place in New Mexico that’s famous for its “artsy” scene, delicious food, and Pueblo-style architecture. It has some of the richest American history that you can get in such a new country, including the Palace of Governor’s (built in 1610). It’s in the foothills of a lovely mountainous region and has lots of ski resorts nearby. You can see a lot of Native American influence there and all over New Mexico, and learn all about the cowboy lifestyle that ruled the west. See also, Taos and Albuquerque. 

San Diego, California. This beach city is consistently ranked a top tourist destination among many other categories, which include culture, entertainment, sightseeing, sports and adventure, and food, etc. It’s beautiful beaches are spread out over 70 miles of coastline, and it has a plethora of gardens, parks, and museums - plus it’s famous zoo! See also, San Francisco. 

Portland, Maine. This northeastern seaside city is famous for its lighthouse photo ops, lobster rolls, and much more. From classic seafood joints to craft breweries, Portland boasts a bustling dining scene and lovely Victorian homes. The Old Port district has great shopping along quaint cobblestone streets and 19th-century warehouses. Eastern Promenade, a 68-acre waterfront park, is home to tons of trails and beaches. A perfect location for watching the sun set. See also, Camden. 

St. Augustine, Florida. This southeastern city was founded by the Spainish back in 1565. St. Augustine is the oldest permanent European settlement in the continental U.S., and is home to some of the country's first Spanish-colonial architecture and many historic buildings. They also had a big role in the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, and there is a Freedom Trail where you can walk in the footsteps of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. It’s also home to Castillo de San Marcos, a 17th-century fortress that features drawbridges and daily cannon fire. See also, Miami and St. Petersburg. 

I could list so much more, Charleston, S.C.; Annapolis, Maryland; Sedona, Arizona; Bozeman, Montana; Newport, RI; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Boston, Massachusetts, etc.

Não é difícil ver que ele em quase 20 anos só acertou uma vez num bom treinador. Não há um projecto ou um plano; quando ele fala em projectos e planos, está a falar do lado financeiro apenas.

Ele está aflito com a contestação e quer poder gastar muito num treinador de nomeada para acalmar os adeptos (e porque seria muito mais caro investir em reforços). O mais provável que ele vai fazer, é insistir novamente no Jesus até ele aceitar. Porque é a única coisa que ele sabe que talvez funcione.

[],,[deleted],,,,,,,dark,,,,,[],"It's not luck though, is it? My club isn't quite at the level of Germany where the fans have a seat on the board but we have a very active and influential fans representative group which has a regular dialogue with the board. I try not to self doxx, otherwise I'd point out a couple of fairly high profile things we've achieved with through this in recent years. 

Further to this though, the club has a number of finance professional fans who scrutinize the club's finances (in conjunction with the club) and the general consensus that the fans want a prudent, financially stable club is one of the guiding principles the club runs on. 

For more high profile examples of fans challenging poor financial practice, look at Blackpool (for those not familiar the majority of Blackpool fans boycotted the club's games for years, some disrupted fixtures via pitch invasions, ran leaflet and media campaigns to remove the Oyston family ftom the club).

Far too many English fans are just too placid though. It's a mark of the English love of the game thst many seem to forget that football is a discretionary spend and they can withdraw their support at any time if the club heads in a direction they don't like. Worse still are fans who turn a blind eye to their club's dodgy dealings for a hint of promised success (looking at you, bury fans).

On your point about reduction in home games, you'd see smaller squads and clubs having to take more of a chance on home grown talent instead of journeymen or premier league rejects, something I think most lower league fans would welcome.  

For instance, my club is one of many to announce it's looking at disbanding its academy (one that's produced several top flight players including two internationals over the last ten or 15 years and made the club millions of pounds) in favour of sweeping up all the premier league dropouts as their view is prem scouting operations are just too good. A change like this might reverse that policy and force clubs to keep investing in their local area instead of just recruiting identikit Scouse or glaswegian dropouts from the big academies. 

What the EFL should also look at doing is insist, like some of its European counterparts, that young players at the very least get educated to A level, if not study for a degree or profession qualification alongside plating football. That would make the decision to leave the game and pursue something else a damn sight easier in a new era of reduced wages (or more accurately fewer opportunities for marquee players) and smaller squads. 

Imagine that; teams where you had 4 or 5 players from the local community consistently who actually give a fuck about the club and might stay for a few years instead of 11 mercenaries who will fuck off at the end of their 1 or 2 year contract and never look back. Seasons where there's something riding on most games instead of waiting for that one genuinely exciting season in 5. Bigger crowds, more excitement. 

Or..... we could just plod on as we are. Biggest mistake football can make is taking the fans for granted though.
