Europe was a slaughterhouse during the middle-ages (called dark ages for a reason) and before nation states, so much that it makes the 20th century world wars look casual, and the concept of borders has brought us an unprecedented era of peace because we've learned to respect those arbitrary lines.

We rank 12/36 for healthcare spending to GDP in the OECD, or 13/36 for public spending alone. We did however rank 34/36 for efficiency in 2009, so that‚Äôs nothing new. 

It also seems to be increasingly left out of the debate that Blair used PFI deals which mean we owe 6x the actual cost of the projects in debt, ¬£300B as opposed to ¬£55B, which we are still saddled with today, instead of cheap public borrowing, just to keep it off of the official deficit figures. This was done so that they could borrow huge sums will feigning some level of fiscal discipline, while lining a few strategic pockets. 

No doubt the awkward fact that Labour left behind a trail of terrible decisions, not just the Tories (who certainly did too), won‚Äôt sit well with Reddit politics, so I expect to get downvoted for pointing it out, as I say, awkward.

Hello I am from Germany, do you think that today our countries are true friends or friendly rivals? I think the second, but this is your post so I want to know about you. Also what stereotypes of your country do you think is correct?|I honestly believe that the rivalry between France and Germany is over now. I know that both our countries have history, but from my perspective, both sides have been working hard to pick up the pieces. I haven't seen anyone trying to outdo the other in terms of political achievements either, but again I'm not super into the subjectn so take what I'm saying with a grain of salt ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø  I think the one stereotype I've seen around that actually holds true is that French people complain a lot, all the time, about literally anything. We really do lol  You'll see us complain about it being too windy, not windy enough, about being tired, about the weather being too dry or about people in general doing this or that wrong. We're not trying to be depressing or anything, it's just kinda our thing. It feels good to vent about the most mundane of things. It gives us something to talk about :)|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/gu9i3s/im_french_ama/fsh2o8v/)

Most of the oil and commodity trade is settled in dollars. Dollar debt is rising in developing countries and was valued at 3.8T USD. Therefore being the world reserve currency allows USA significant leeway in monetary policy.

Compare this to the Euro and the Kroner, the Euro share of central bank reserves is 20 percent compared to 2009 where it was 28 percent. The EU demographic is declining at a faster rate than USA. You can note this by comparing the median age which the EU median age is around 43 whilst USA is 38. As such, printing money for EU and Norway etc companies do not work because their currency is not a reserve currency, they have an aging demographic which basically mean their future economic prospects are limited. Moreover the EU has generous pension schemes whereby significant monetary policy might even cause political ramifications since pensioners remain an increasingly powerful political group. 

Therefore, the EU cannot print money endlessly but the US can as demand for dollar debt and dollars are generally high.

Very different brain and abilities. 
My logic is sound. I have pointed out many times how yours is not. Take that as you may. I suspect you'll ignore it. 
As far as communication, the numerous upvotes on my original comment would suggest I'm not doing too bad. As would the fact I scored in the top one percent of all people in the nation on English ACT and SAT. Your numerous and constant grammatical errors, along with your inability see basic inconsistencies and fallacies in what you write, would suggest your communication is what needs a little help (to be fair, you can't communicate anything other than drivel if your brain doesn't produce anything other than).

\&gt; Governments across Europe and North America have showed an almost callous disregard for the health of their citizens, and the world

\&gt; In Asia, meanwhile, oases of single-minded purpose have sprung up, sincere in their efforts to ‚Äòflatten the curve‚Äô of transmission

Citing Italy, Spain, France, and Britain as having ‚Äúarrogantly ignoring the signs of a creeping killer‚Äù, the article represented these nations as having treated the coronavirus as a distant foreign illness, ‚Äúthus stoking xenophobia among their populations‚Äù.

In contrast, the article cites Singapore, Taiwan, and Hong Kong as ‚Äúoases of calm‚Äù, characterizing them as having shown ‚Äúsingle-minded purpose and sincerity‚Äù in their efforts to contain the virus. South Korea os also praised highly, with Korea‚Äôs rapid and well organized implementation of effective containment measures being contrasted repeatedly with the comparatively slow, ineffectual, and poorly organized responses of Western nations.

In this article Western nations are depicted as xenophobic, lacking in communal spirit, and suffering from ‚Äúwilful ignorance of how interconnected the world is‚Äù. Their citizens are described as passive and inactive in the face of the pandemic, waiting helplessly for their inept governments to solve the problem for them.

Asian citizens in contrast, are depicted as socially responsible, full of public spirit, and dynamically active in the face of peril.

Recent scholarly literature indicates that the traditionally accepted dichotomy of Western societies as predominantly individualist and Eastern societies as predominantly collectivist is not as accurate as it once was, with several papers demonstrating a shift in values and attitudes on both sides, in particular individualism becoming more popular in the East.

Nevertheless, the traditional dichotomy is still widely viewed as accurate in Asia itself, where Western individualism is often equated with selfishness, and collectivism is seen as distinctly Asian. This article from the Shanghai China Morning Post is therefore not an anomaly, but an exhibition of mainstream Eastern perceptions of the West. The article also illustrates the fact that a specifically anti-Western sentiment still prevails in Asia, with so-called Western values contrasted unfavorably with so-called Asian values. 

There's a lengthy history of the concept of uniquely Asian values being used by governments of nations in the South East Asia Pacific region to attribute their rapid modernization to distinctively Asian modes of thought, and to argue for the superiority of their socio-economic status over supposedly economically stagnant and morally degenerate Western nations.",True,False,False,,,0,1590981095,,False,0,{},fshmwj4,False,t3_gtvere,False,True,t1_fsgceow,/r/Anarchism/comments/gtvere/unpopular_opinion_this_year_in_some_ways_is_one/fshmwj4/,False,,1596925203,2,True,False,Anarchism,t5_2qh5j,r/Anarchism,public,,0,[],

The meeting was attended by the Ministers of State H.S.Puri and Som Parkash, Secretaries of the Department of Commerce, and Pharmaceuticals, and Officers from Departments of Commerce, Pharmaceuticals and Health.
During his interaction, Goyal lauded the pharma industry for making India proud, by rising to the occasion during the Covid crisis.¬†
He said that India has been recognized as the ‚ÄòPharmacy of the World‚Äô, as over 120 countries got some essential medicines, during the last two months, including 40 of them getting them in the form of grant, free of cost.¬†
He said that during the crisis, the officials of DGFT, MEA, Health and DoP burnt midnight oil to ensure that the export consignments are delivered at the earliest.¬†
The whole world appreciated India‚Äôs gesture, and this has swelled India‚Äôs goodwill and reputation.¬†
He said that India had adequate production capacity and abundant stock of HCQ and PCM for its projected domestic requirements, and putting restrictions on their exports was to ensure that the medicines are made available to all the needy nations, and no unscrupulous element stocks them for unwarranted gains.
The Pharma industry received accolades from the Minister for their extra-ordinary performance, in ensuring that the Country did not face any type of shortage of medicines during this period. ¬†
Goyal said that early announcement of the Lockdown helped the country in preventing and containing the scourge of pandemic, and also scaling up the health infrastructure and build capacity, besides generating awareness among the people about the precautions and preventive measures.¬†
He said that India has set an example, under the able guidance and leadership of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in being pro-active in management of Covid-19, and also following it up with welfare and relief packages for mitigating its consequences.
Goyal assured the industry that the Government will fully support the industry in its expansion, diversification and strengthening.¬†
He said that the industry has an important role to play in the Aatamnirbhar Bharat campaign. The country should become Aatmanirbhar in APIs as early as possible, as the government has taken a number of steps in this regard.¬†
It has already approved the scheme on Promotion of Bulk Drug Parks for financing Common Infrastructure Facilities in 3 Bulk Drug Parks.¬†
Also, Production Linked Incentive Scheme for promotion of domestic manufacturing of critical KSMs/Drug Intermediates and APIs in the country has been given a go ahead.
The Minister said that anti-dumping investigation process has been expedited. The Minister said that in case of ongoing bilateral FTAs, if any roadblock or unfair competition is being noticed, the Government may be informed and prompt remedial action will be taken. He said they should look at large untapped market in Eastern Europe and Russia.¬†
Calling upon a collaborative route in the R&amp;D efforts, Goyal said the Academicians, Universities, ICMR and private sector should join hands.¬†
Informing the gathering that the Government has decided to disinvest in certain Pharma PSUs, the Minister invited the Indian companies to use PSUs for plug and play model of manufacturing.¬†
The Minister assured the industry that all suggestions presented in the meeting will be quickly examined and wherever required, the inter-ministerial consultations will be completed at the earliest.

In english, that doesn't need to be said because the verb rarely changes. For example, for the verb ""to write"", if you are giving an order, you just say, for example ""hey, write this down for me"". In portuguese, however, the verb changes. Check out for example, the verb escrever (to write):

Eu escrevo (I write)

Tu escreves / Voc√™ escreve (you write)

Ele/ela escreve (he/she writes)

N√≥s escrevemos (we write)

V√≥s escreveis (you (plural) write - really really really not common in brazilian portuguese, we just use ""voc√™s escrevem"")

Eles escrevem (they write)

However, when you are giving an order, the verb is used like this:

Escreve (tu) - (You) write

Escreva (voc√™) - (You) write


This form is called the imperative. Same thing for the verb chamar in the post, which becomes ""chama"" or ""chame"" in the imperative form. Usually, you just take out the ""ar/er/ir"" and slap on ""a/e"" in its place (any of these two will mean basically the same thing, so don't worry about it). There are exceptions, though, for example the verb ""dormir"" (to sleep) becomes either ""dorme"" or ""durma"". 

Portuguese verbal conjugation is extremely complex, there are several situations and auxiliary verbs used to indicate various different times of the verb.

The whole idea of french settlers in NA was to build trading forts to trade with the native (Algonquin). No nation was displaced, or went to war with (not in the beginning, cultural assimilation happened during the 1800's-1900's). Most early colonist settled on unclaimed land on the east coast.

The big 2 groups where already a war with each other: Iroquois vs Algonquin. They were fighting for control of territory. You could argue that the european trade increased their need to more territory.

The french allied with their closest tribe (Algonquin), and the english/dutch with their closest tribe (Iroquois).

The iroquois displaced the Algonquin, and then they asked their french allies to help them. The french tried to negotiate a treaty, and after it failures, joined the war to help their allies. Iroquoi were stronger, took some land with the direct help of dutch weapons, and launched attacks on french settlers.

And, to do the story quick, the dutch got defeated by the english, the english didn't really helped the Iroquoi that much, the french really got tired of getting attacked and losing territory and France sent an army against them. The Iroquoi surrendered after that.

A peace treaty was formed afterward, and the Iroquoi started attacking the english instead. (lol)

The iroquoi, especially the Mohawk, is a weird case where their land claimed aren't cultural, or ancestral, but a land conquered from the french and Algonquian, that was recognized to them after a war treaty with the french. You can see the map drawn after the treaty:

And you haven't pointed to me having flawed logic at all, you've said I couldn't see the nuance over and over, but never pointed to where i've had some logical inconsistency or something.  Please, feel free to point to that so it can be addressed.  Where have I been illogical in some form?

&gt; As far as communication, the numerous upvotes on my original comment would suggest I'm not doing too bad.

Did you seriously just point to the comment that you edited after it got upvoted to say ""I'm getting upvotes on Reddit, so I'm assuming I'm being misunderstood.""  Like seriously?  Are you just trolling at this point, or am I missing some ""nuance"" again?  Not to mention upvotes being a metric of how well something was communicated is a pretty silly concept.

&gt;As would the fact I scored in the top one percent of all people in the nation on English ACT and SAT

I also scored quite well on those, though I do not recall the exact percentile since that was well over a decade ago and I do not repeat my test scores to random people frequently.  Those tests are a joke though.

&gt;Your numerous and constant grammatical errors

Ah the classic grammar rebuttal I see.  I find it fantastic that you bring this up in a post you don't bother using paragraphs in...

&gt;I know you people love to throw incel around, but I have some news for you. There is a 99.9 percent chance I get more pussy and ass than you do, seeing as I'm bisexual and attractive. I spent three years before college getting paid to wear stupid shit and walk down runways in Europe and NYC. Regardless of anything else, people want my cock because of my looks.

Hey, you come across as a classic incel pretty strongly (the whole Women should dress conservatively and then saying I should get back to the ktichen thing) is pretty classic.  Asking if you were one was totally justified I think.  Glad to know your not.

&gt;Not only this, I come from a very well off family. As in top one percent.

Hmmmmm, someone who was born into great circumstances expects others to just make their own success like you did (except you partially didn't, trust fund and all that).  You are aware of how crazy lucky you are and how much of a boost to your chances of success you had from that right?  And that it goes the other way, people born into shittier circumstances have a far harder time succeeding and getting out of where they are.

&gt;I'm also a diagnosed sociopath, so I just don't like people. Especially idiots, such as yourself.

Id believe it.  Its pretty clear you have little to no ability to shift your perspective and view things from other peoples standpoint.  Or put yourself in their position and imagine what it might be like.

So you a born into an affluent family, and lack empathy.  I feel like that basically 100% explains how your view on this thing can be so hilariously off.

&gt;I'm sure you won't believe all of this, because why would that guy be on Reddit talking to you right? Believe what you may, because I will still be me, you still be you, and reality will still be reality.

Most of what you've said is totally believeable because of how well it lines up actualy.  So you got that going for you sexy.

&gt;Decent effort at being an ass and sticking it to the man. Sorry you failed so horribly, not that you could have succeeded.

What, I wasn't attempting to stick it to the man or anything, you are very clearly not ""the man"" in that sense...  

&gt;When you're me, the vast majority of people are below in at least one significant way. 

Look, its the same for me (I guess not in the attractiveness department as I'm maybe above average face wise at best, but I am physicaly fit and athletic).  But its way better to not treat people as if they are below you so much.  If nothing else, your easy dismissal of others may make you miss something insightful on the rare occasion it comes around and make your position/stance on something less good then it could be.

Really it looks like this comes down to you being born in fantastic circumstances and not having the ability to see how ridiculous your idea of ""just shape up guys"" is when there is so much stacked against them.  TONS of people born in shitty conditions try as hard or harder then you have in your life, but get nowhere due to how stacked it was against them.  We need to eliminate that and bring the floor up.  Black communities and culture would get ""better"" as you say if we did that.  Fuck, thats demonstrably true in several areas.  It really seems like the no brainer thing to do to me.

There are numerous situations where it has been shown that researchers falsify data to ensure further funding, especially in areas related to smoking, oil and other hot button issues.  But if you look below the surface they are not so much lying as manipulating the data to support something.  

The overall rate of false discoveries is about 11% for the top 6 medical journals.  But if you dig deeper you see that it is not so much ""false"" as statistically not significant, but being touted as significant.  So an exaggeration rather than a lie. 

Meaning the ""scientists"" are not really ""lying"".  If this were really the case we'd best give up airplanes, elevators, aspirin, iPhones, plastic, microwave ovens, and so on. 

The studies on penis size are from various times and various areas.   Big ones (meaning large numbers of participants) on western male genitalia have been done in the US (2000+), Europe (2000+) and UK (15000+).  While worldwide we have large studies in China (5000+), Turkey (2000+), South Korea (a series of studies with 1000+).   

And somehow, across languages, across boarders and 10000s of miles and across 70 years all these scientists were able to work together and collude on an average penis size just to help us all feel better.  

I'm not seeing it.  I'm sorry, I want to help you out here.  But I just cannot see it.  Why would anyone falsify this data?  Who is to gain?  Someone somewhere would have to gain monetarily for this to really work.  But no one makes any money from a fake average.  

I would guess the opposite.  Let's try this ""logic"" thing again and see if it works any better than this silly ""science""...

If the real average was larger, then condom companies would loose money.  If the companies were producing condoms that were too small they would loose piles of money.  They would have to invest in their own studies to ensure that the product was successful.  Companies like Trojan or Durex would have to put in the time and effort to find the real average to ensure they were not producing a whole bunch of unusable product.

Most know the name to hold some level of disappointment. All of that changes in June. It's poised to grow like never before. Conservatively a doubling but it could push to a 1$.

Here's the bull case for it.

Let's start with the potential impending news. In their recent quarterly conference call they address two upcoming catalysts.

-One is their move into the European market. They mentioned that they were ""in the final stages of preparation to make the first batch of Probuphine next month for Molteni Farmaceutici, their EU partner"". This is a major milestone as the expand internationally.

-The next, but less significantly is the long awaited FDA approval of their virtual REMS training program (a response to the shelter in place). This would allow them to train health care workers to administer Probuphine in the states.
Now for the biggest concern in a penny stock: dilution and RS.

Rest assured, that concern does not exist here- for the time being. Primarily because the Reverse Split that was raised in the last shareholder meeting in December did not get a full turnout until March. They kept pushing it back month after month. Granted, the results did come in favor of ""Yes"" but they fell short the 10 million shares to get majority.

Here was the readout: Favor: 30,434,934 . Against: 25,292,616. Abstain: 798,345. They needed 41,614,025 in order for it to pass.

Which brings on the the upcoming shareholder meeting for June 30th. They're opting to go for an Authorized Share increase this time, seeking majority approval. Seeing the fate that befell them on the previous shareholder meeting, they would need to prove some level of competency going into this one. If management is able to convince the shareholder that they aren't completely worthless in the month of June, it may tilt the votes in their favor.

Immediate dilution would be the next biggest concern. And I can say with confidence that it will not happen in the month of June. They have only ""5,121,069 shares of common stock available for issuance"" according to the Def14A filing for the vote. That issued at a discount would hardly keep the lights on for a month. They also stated in their quarterly conference call that they had cash on hand until Q3.

With money running low and compliance (and continued listing) questionable, they need dazzle existing shareholders into giving them the second change they want- even if may not be deserved.

The Play:
Load up shares from .25-.30. Anything within the current range should be fine. The probability of new hitting grows with every passing week. If nothing drops this week, I'm confident in a W2 or W3 Press Release. The biggest headwind is the health of the market and it looks to be holding its own.

More recently they typically will have badly spoken Chinese instead and I think that is a much better option in comparison to fake Chinese, so I don't mind.

Japanese films often have people who supposedly lived in Germany and America speak horrible English and German. Chinese films have a lot of Eastern European non-native English speakers play Brits, so it goes the other way around too. 

I think as long as the actors can get the tone across I am completely fine with it. Often I just ignore the Chinese and pretend he is just speaking some dialect I have never heard of and read the text instead. There are only a few hundred thousand Chinese speakers in Germany and too insignificant of the target market population to cater to in any particular way.

I think that you have no idea what the ""North"" demanded.  If you had, you would have been using the term ""Nazi"" yourself.  In fact, as far as Greece goes, the creditors got everything they asked for.  The result was utter destruction, and tens of thousands of additional deaths by the contraction of the health care system.  Wages and pensions were cut, people starved or committed suicide, or just packed and left.   I do not know what was fuck**g noticed in the Netherlands, but whatever it was, it came from their collective arses....It was not the truth, or even close to the truth.  

Greece, Portugal and Ireland should have been allowed to default, as they should.  But Germany would have seen its banks destroyed (as they should have, for taking silly risks).  Thus, the Germans came up with the great idea of ""rescuing"" Greece and forcing the average Greek to pay the German banks!!  Thus, 93% of all ""rescue"" funds went straight back to the German banks with interest!!!  The money came from the outrageous taxing of the citizens (today Greece has the highest tax burden in the EU).  Even so, Greece, Cyprus, Portugal and others are still in ""debtor's prison"" from which they are not expected to exit before 2067!!!  So, now tell me again what was actually noticed in the ""North""???  Anything resembling reality or just the typical racist rants????

&gt; This might have happend faster if the South haven't pushed for month for Eurobonds that are simply not happening because they violate the democratic principle fundamentally. 

This utter bullshit passes for reality???  Eurobonds violate democratic principles???  Which are those, in particular????   I really have it up to here with these kinds of cheap tricks in which the thiefs get to keep their ill-gotten gains.

For real democracy in the EU, we need to dissolve the Euro.  Period.  The southern states will get their more flexible currencies and they would make the products of the North much more expensive, thus, boosting their exports and limiting their imports.  The North gets to take back its unemployment, which it has been ""exporting"" so nicely with its ""beggar thy neighbor"" policies.

It is crazy for Greece, Portugal, or Ireland (or Slovenia) to have the same currency as Germany.  The value of the Euro reflects mostly the German economy, not the economies of these countries.  Without their own currency, they are ""naked"" in the German attack on their markets.  It is progressively obvious that the Euro is a ""sick"" currency and it is getting sicker all the time.  

No solution is satisfactory for the south because we are dealing with open warfare.  It is preposterous to believe that a small economy can be as competitive as a major one.  Even if a Greek firm has a great idea, it simply does not have the capital, nor can it raise the capital to increase productivity to a level at which it would beat the German company.  Productivity depends on the introduction of new and improved methods and machinery (computers, integrated systems, robots, etc).  A vast economy can commandeer these resources, a small cannot, irrespective of the desire to work hard or having great ideas.  On top of that, having an unrepresentative currency is totally ridiculous.

Connectivity wise umidigi wins with wider range of lte connectivity in both fdd and udd ranges, doogee only works on limited range of fdd which makes me wonder how will mobile internet work on it in my country (poland)

Also umidigi comes with usb c which is less likely of breaking than typical micro usb port

There is also z2 with android 8.1 but i feel like its bit too dated to be worth investing into which as well fits in the price range and has more 6gb ram as opposed to 4gb on both a7 pro and n20

The n20 on the other hand wins by price it costs as little as 403pln which is around 70 usd the camrea, processor and gpu are both the same, screen is bigger but the tradeoff is 9ppi less, less lte range and micro usb port and older os than a7pro

Do you have a weighted vest? I've have one where you can vary the weight ([this one](https://www.bulldoggear.eu/products/weighted-vest)) - going from unweighted to 20lb is a too big a jump. Start out light and build up.

Where are you naturally gifted? I find push-ups the easier part of the exercise (which according to the posts I see here others find hard) and the squats hard (whereas others find them easy). Identify your weaknesses and make a plan. 

Break the exercise down:

* Can you run a mile with 10lb? How about 15lb or 20lb?
* Same with the pull-ups, push-ups and squats

Just doing WODs isn't the best plan here. Work on each of the exercises - I've found the [Russian Fighter Pull-Up Program](https://www.t-nation.com/training/tip-do-the-russian-fighter-pull-up-program) really useful. 

You say you're ""willing to workout everyday towards this goal"" - in my opinion this is a bad plan, your body needs rest. I know it's hard, but don't risk an injury as it will delay your progress. Build slowly over time, you have a year.

C'√® una nota azienda di telecomunicazioni che sta lavorando con una grossa azienda di automobili (non posso fare nomi perch√© √® ancora sotto NDA) per collegare tutte le varie macchine in 5g. Prima del 5g non si poteva fare, perch√© la latenza era troppo elevata. Sistemi propietari, per definizione, costano troppo: quando si standardizza una tecnologia, rendendola disponibile a chiunque, si abbassa il prezzo del prodotto. Inoltre, il vantaggio pi√π grande √® la semplicit√† con cui si riorganizza la fabbrica: dopo che hai finito di produrre il prodotto A, la catena passa a produrre il prodotto B. Bisogna riorganizzare completamente tutto, e ci vuole molto tempo per cambiare tutti i collegamenti in fibra ottica (diverse settimane, anche qui non posso dirti il tempo esatto). Usando il 5g, il tempo per cambiare la topologia della rete si riduce di molto, cosa che fa risparmiare una barca di soldi alle aziende.

Smart cities, per farla pi√π breve di prima, vuol dire automatizzare una citt√†: pensa per dire, che i cestini abbiano dei sensori, e mandino un segnale per essere svuotati solo quando sono pieni. In questo rendi molto pi√π efficiente il processo di svuotamento. Oppure, quando in sismografo sente una scossa sopra il 3 della scala Richter, fa diventare rossi tutti i semafori, cos√¨ evita incidenti.

La guida autonoma √® pi√π vicina di quanto si pensi. Tutte le case automobilistiche sono molto avanti con gli sviluppi. Ovviamente uscir√† prima su auto da 100k ‚Ç¨ e solo tra 15 anni sulla panda. In ogni caso, la comunicazione tra veicoli √® anche diretta (non solo in rete) e usa il 5g (bassa latenza e standardizzato). Al di l√† della vera e propria guida autonoma, molte tecnologie di sicurezza stanno venendo fuori, e l'unione europea dovrebbe standardizzarle a breve, che richiedono la comunicazione diretta dei veicoli.

Per quando riguarda il numero di utenti, anche l√¨ no: per gli utenti umani chiaramente s√¨, ma nei posti affollati andr√† decisamente meglio costando molto meno. Esempio, il concerto di Vasco ha richiesto l'installazione di una rete ad hoc, sia per i cittadini che per la polizia (di sicurezza). Se ci fosse stato gi√† il 5g, il numero di base station installate sarebbe diminuito a meno del 20% (anche qui non posso darti i numeri esatti, penso sia ancora sotto NDA). 
Per gli utenti iot invece i dispositivi aumentaranno sempre di pi√π, le proiezioni parlano di miliardi di utenti a breve. Per le comunicazioni iot la prima cosa che si vuole √® efficienza: un dispositivo vuoi che funzioni per 5-10 anni, senza dovergli cambiare batteria. In Italia, paese delle banane, LoRaWAN (standard iot)  non √® utilizzabile per motivi stupidi. Si potrebbe usare il NB-IoT, che √® uno standard molto recente del 4G, ma ha delle limitazioni, e appunto, con l'uscita ora del 5G non ha molto senso implementarlo, visto che il 5G garantisce pi√π utenti (decine di migliaia per km2) e consumi minori.",True,False,False,,,0,1590997694,,False,0,{},fsi8vwl,False,t3_gtfp74,False,False,t1_fshaqno,/r/italy/comments/gtfp74/un_club_delle_democrazie_per_il_5g_lidea_di/fsi8vwl/,False,,1596936372,3,True,False,italy,t5_2qkhk,r/italy,public,,0,[],

It was a war for territory in our case, tovarish. A war you forced us to join after annexing, as it is your custom, parts of our territories. In any case, Romania paid huge war reparations to the USSR, we lost territories, we were under the Soviet yoke for 40 years etc. We paid the price. When are you paying the price for all the millions of people that your country killed while ""liberating"" Eastern Europe? The millions killed for opposing the Soviet regime? The ones who were deported? The ones who died in gulags? 

&gt;Oh, eastern europeans are different, and those for them who are sellouts - well it's their choice, we don't wanna pay them for loyalty anymore.

Pay us for loyalty? No tovarish, you cannot afford to pay anyone for loyalty, you point a gun at their head and demand loyalty. Those times are gone for us, fortunately. 

&gt;If Germany is willingful to sponsor Poland-Baltics-Czechia-Bulgaria-Romania - let it be so. From other side they pay you from your own money by using you as market, bu-u-ut who cares, right?

Oh yes, look at Belarus, how rich they are and how well off they are, being Russian allies. 

&gt;Whoever thinks americans would fight for anyone except themselves - wasn't really paying attention to history.

No one claimed otherwise. It just so happens that our interests and their interests coincide: we both dislike you. There's a saying in Romanian: the enemy of my enemy is my friend. That's what we are doing.

&gt;Do they teach you how good NATO is in schools? You are so confident in this belief... Unless some bomb falls in your kitchen.

NATO is indeed great for us. Bombs fall in the kitchen of countries that are the enemies of NATO, not its own members. 

&gt;But a country with nukes and missiles to carry them can ;)

Sure, but no economy to support a war. Your economy kinda crashed after annexing Crimea and the sanctions were pretty light in my opinion, imagine in a full out war. You'd end up starving in no time, tovarish. Is that why you're trying to be buddies with the Chinese, so they would invest in your country a bit if war comes? 

&gt;Plus Italy internal market goes in euros, and Russian in rubles, which changes picture drastically. But why would dear mr. Antonescu care.

Oh yeah, the ruble is such a strong currency. 

&gt;But both of them were trained and equipped by your NATO. That's the saddest part of both conflicts.

I fail to remember the moment when Ukraine or Georgia joined NATO. The mere thought of joining it is what made you invade them. 

&gt;When your USA idols corrupt countries to organize wars (Saakashvili and Chinval and second maidan respectively) and later benefit from that. Trump-Zelensky, Biden-Burisma, Poroshenko military contracts etc. Well, if that's what you want for Romania - good luck.

Ah yes, it was Americans who started the wars in Georgia and Ukraine, of course. Poor Russia, just fighting for what's best for the Ukrainian people. Honestly, you're so far behind when it comes to some reasonable excuses, you're using the same old KGB theories from the 50s that no one with half a brain would believe.

You're argument implies that not speaking out against something can be construed as tacit support of it. Lewis has spoken out about the protests in America whereas he hasn't about the problems in the middle east, therefore, according to your post, he must have no real problem with it, or, at least, not overly care about it. 

My argument would be that caring for one thing is better than caring for nothing - even if you are a hypocrite.

I doubt you would argue that Kimi, in silently agreeing to race in Russia is a supporter of Russian foreign policy.

&gt; There is an aspect of history and British tastes involved here.
&gt; 
&gt; British fishermen for most of the 20th century actually had the reputation they ascribe to the Spanish and French - fairly in their case. The UK adopted steam trawlers early, along with power winches and equipment - indeed pre World War I. The result was the British (English and Scottish) fishermen 'raped' the fishing grounds of Norway, Iceland and the Newfoundland Grand Banks. These fisheries recovered during WW I and WW II, to start collapsing again when UK fishermen accessed them at the end of each war. A major factor in all of this was the UK national taste for deep sea white fish, Cod in particular, but also Haddock, etc. These fish are/were less abundant in British waters - preferring instead the northern colder waters of Norway, Iceland and the Grand Banks. The British public then and now largely eschew much of the inshore waters fish from UK waters, prawns, monkfish, etc. Moreover, in the absence of a single market, these fish landed from UK couldn't make it sufficiently quickly to French, Spanish and the mainland European markets that actually like them.
&gt; 
&gt; The whole thing started to go 'pear-shaped' with the Norwegian Fishing Case which started in 1933, but was only ruled by and international tribunal on in 1951 - in which Norway gained the right to exclude UK trawlers from its fishing grounds. This caused the UK's rapacious fishing industry to increase its catches from the Grand Banks and Iceland, with two results - the Grand Banks Cod fishery slowly collapsed between 1969-1986, and the Icelanders decided they wanted UK trawlers controlled, which led to the successive Cod Wars from 1958-1976 during which the UK deployed the Navy to force access to Icelandic waters - but the UK lost in 1976.
&gt; 
&gt; Why does all of this matter. Because the UK was negotiating accession in the early 1970s - and at that time, the UK fishing industry had little serious interest the waters close to the UK, since its market was the UK - where the consumers preferred the deep water white fish from the Grand Banks and Iceland - and the UK was confident that it could continue to force access to those fish. The result was that the UK took a very relaxed view of UK waters with respect to the common fisheries policy.
&gt; 
&gt; What changed - well the UK lost the Cod Wars and due to the imminent collapse of the Grand Banks fisheries, by 1978 the Canadians started to take steps to restrict access to those waters for US and UK (and other) boats. Even so, the UK kept the lions share of the fishing quotas for UK inshore waters - 60-80%, allocating them to UK fishermen. The problem was, under the Thatcher administration, with its extreme capitalism, those quotas turned into property rights that could be sold - and retiring British fishermen sold them (screwing their heirs) in large quantities - so that Spanish, Netherland and French fishermen, so called quota hoppers, came to buy well over ¬Ω of those UK quotas. In this note the inherent dishonesty of the British fishermen's complain - their families chose to sell the quotas, 'trouser' the cash, then whinge about 'not having their cake and eating it.' By the way, this is going to add a multibillion cost to the Brexit bill if UK fishermen get what they want, as I'll explain below.
&gt; 
&gt; The second thing that changed was the Single Market - and seamless fast transport to the European mainland. All of a sudden fish landed in UK (and Irish) fishing ports could be at Les Halles for example, while still reasonably fresh - the fish the British public disdained could make it to France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain in time to secure a premium price. Suddenly the UK fishermen were resenting the deals that had been made in 1973 - and their own sale of quotas. But remember, the UK fishing industry had largely screwed itself, in part because they though they could keep screwing Iceland and Newfoundland.
&gt; 
&gt; Now the awkward details. UK fishermen dream of revoking the quota-hoppers rights to use the fishing quotas those UK fisherman sold; but international law would deny expropriation without compensation. So if those quotas are to be revoked, their EU owners will have to be compensated at current value - that bill will run into billions of pounds. And if the UK doesn't compensate for such expropriation, the consequences for foreign inward investment (in all UK assets and industries) would be dire. The second awkward problem addressed in this article, the UK industry needs seamless access to EU markets for the UK fish, because the UK public still doesn't really like those fish varieties.",True,False,False,,,0,1591004315,,False,0,{},fsiflkr,False,t3_gs20f1,False,True,t1_fsgz14m,/r/brexit/comments/gs20f1/what_are_the_ramifications_for_the_eu_27_in_a_no/fsiflkr/,False,,1596939710,1,True,False,brexit,t5_33mm8,r/brexit,public,,0,[],

I‚Äôve tried the pros cons list, and in my free time I‚Äôve explored the subjects that I value even tho they don‚Äôt provide traditional success or money. But I can‚Äôt escape the feeling that I‚Äôm wasting my potential. 

For example, I really like biology, animals, and most specifically monkeys. But dedicating my life to studying monkeys or working with monkeys seems like such a waste because it would require financial sacrifices for lower status. 

Part of my issue is that I do value success and money.  So combining that with a passion or interest is the difficult part. 

Honestly I think I will end up going to law school or start the track of graduate studies to become a professor. I always arrive at the conclusion that my interests aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive to my ambition. I could easily be a lawyer that focuses on animal abuse, for example. 

ENTJs typically don‚Äôt chart a middle course though and I‚Äôm also aware enough to realize once I‚Äôm in law school, I‚Äôll feel the same pull or push towards the more prestige or well paying types of law. 

The big issue I face more than career, is location. I‚Äôm not tied to any state. I‚Äôve lived in several already. And I‚Äôm completely clueless about where I want to live. I spend hours looking at google maps, comparing housing prices, job listings, making lists of my desired attributes, and I get stuck in decision paralysis.

[],,Fra_Bernardo,,,,[],,,,text,t2_4enm9dft,False,False,[],"The National Crime Agency hopes to turn illegal immigrants into whistleblowers against traffickers by offering them the possibility of improving their chances of staying in the UK.

The approach is aimed at achieving more arrests and convictions. Rob Richardson, head of the NCA slavery and human trafficking unit, said that prosecutions were difficult to secure unless victims went on the record.

In return for helping the police, they could have any potential immigration offences handled more sensitively, Mr Richardson said.

The NCA‚Äôs Operation Fort smashed a trafficking ring in the West Midlands last year. As many as 400 people, many of them Polish, were saved from rat- infested homes and menial, unpaid work.

The organisation‚Äôs intelligence gathering has been hampered by the coronavirus pandemic, with lockdown pushing [trafficking gangs](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/gangs-use-top-schools-to-traffic-asian-girls-p0vphpbmx) further underground and with fewer opportunities for the public to spot suspicious activities.

The new approach is intended to tackle one of the main problems: that those enslaved by the gangs fear speaking out because they are in the country illegally.

‚ÄúWe are saying to these people, through non-government organisations, that if they come forward we will look after them and safeguard them as a priority and their immigration status will be considered as a secondary factor,‚Äù Mr Richardson told *The Times*. ‚ÄúThe first thing we will do is look after these individuals and look after their wellbeing before we consider their immigration status.‚Äù

While this initiative stops short of a get-out-of-jail-free card for illegal workers, Mr Richardson said: ‚ÄúThere is a balance to be had. If people are in exploitative situations or are being exploited, we have a duty of care to them as well. If an immigration offence has been committed that would have to be investigated, but it would be investigated sensitively.‚Äù

There has been a ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù increase in [migrants crossing the Channel](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ministers-accused-of-paralysis-as-3-000-migrants-cross-the-channel-tqtj2pgg7) in dinghies in recent weeks. Lockdown has greatly restricted the activities of more accessible modes of illicit transport: lorries, the Channel Tunnel and ferries.

Fine weather has also improved conditions for risky crossings of the busiest shipping channel in the world. Many illegal migrants continue to come from Eritrea, China, eastern Europe and Vietnam, from where 39 men and women who suffocated in a lorry in Essex last year started their journey.

As lockdown lifts, the public are being warned to be wary of offers that seem too good to be true from businesses keen to win back customers. The NCA said that these discounts could be signs of modern slavery.

‚ÄúIf you are getting your nails done super cheaply or your car is getting washed for ¬£5, it‚Äôs usually because the people are not being paid properly to do that. Cheap takeaway food is another area of concern,‚Äù Mr Richardson said.

‚ÄúThere is a huge amount of information now about sweatshops abroad, but there is less awareness of things happening here. We need to get the public to ask questions. They need to ask, ‚ÄòHang on a minute, how can this possibly be so cheap? Is somebody suffering somewhere along the line?‚Äô ‚Äù

The NCA expected that the closure of many services for lockdown would result in illegal workers being abandoned on to the streets by gangs who had no use for them.

However, NCA intelligence and local police reports suggest that trafficked workers have been switched to other jobs. Sex workers have been forced instead into pay-per-view video sites where they work for online customers. Car wash workers may have been shifted into agriculture, factories and distribution centres to meet changing public demand.

Mr Richardson added: ‚ÄúOrganised crime moves to where there is an opportunity to make money. If it cannot make money where it is, it will move elsewhere.‚Äù

**Six in ten voters want tougher action against Channel dinghies**

Six out of ten people do not believe that the government is doing enough to tackle the increase in the number of crossing the Channel in small boats, a poll suggests (Richard Ford writes).

The number of migrants who have reached the UK this year will soon overtake the total who made the journey from France in the whole of last year. By last Thursday about 1,730 migrants had crossed the Channel, compared with 1,890 in 2019.

The government has paid almost ¬£62 million to the French in the past five years for joint initiatives intended to tackle illegal immigration.

Priti Patel, the home secretary, is looking at whether laws are needed to enable UK Border Force cutters to turn vessels back to France.

The Deltapoll, on behalf of Migration Watch UK, which campaigns for lower immigration, suggests that 60 per cent of those questioned did not believe the government was doing enough to stop the crossings.

The view was shared by supporters of all three major parties, with 66 per cent of Conservative supporters saying not enough was being done, 55 per cent of Labour supporters and 52 per cent of Liberal Democrats.

Alp Mehmet, chairman of Migration Watch UK, said: ‚ÄúThe public want their government to deliver on their promise to tackle illegal Channel crossing. If Priti Patel really is serious about getting a grip on this then that is good news. But it is deeds, rather than words, that will restore public confidence, stem the flow and ensure the taxpayer gets value for money.‚Äù

**Suspected online assaults on water plant and port offer clues to next stage of rivalry**

In early April, municipal workers at a water pumping station in central Israel noticed a warning from their computer systems ‚Äî a few pumps had been malfunctioning, turning off and on without being told to.

At first, it seemed innocuous ‚Äî water pumps are finicky and the malfunctions did not seem to disrupt the supply ‚Äî but within hours, investigators found something more ominous.

A piece of Iranian-written code had travelled around the world, passing through servers in the US and Europe to hide its origins, and finally to the commercially manufactured software controllers that operated the water pumps, according to four Israeli officials and a western intelligence official briefed on the findings.

Its suspected goal? To trick the computers into increasing the amount of chlorine added to the treated water that flows to Israeli homes, the western official said.

An Israeli official said the suspected attack ‚Äî the latest salvo in the four-decade hostility between the two countries ‚Äî had opened the door to ‚Äúan unpredictable risk scenario‚Äù. The official added that it had created a precedent for tit-for-tat cyber attacks on civilian infrastructure that both countries have so far avoided ‚Äî and may still be keen to avoid.

An Iranian regime insider dismissed the allegations.

‚ÄúIran cannot politically afford to try to poison Israeli civilians. And even if Iran did so, where is the Israelis‚Äô appropriate response?‚Äù the regime insider said. ‚ÄúOur suspicion is that Israelis want more money from the US and made up the whole thing. But the Americans are no idiots.‚Äù

Alireza Miryousefi, spokesman for Iran‚Äôs mission to the UN, said Iran‚Äôs cyber activities ‚Äúare purely defensive and protective‚Äù.

‚ÄúAs a victim of cyber warfare‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâand other cyber sabotages, we know well how destructive it can be,‚Äù Mr Miryousefi said. ‚ÄúWe have been continuously a target by malevolent forces, and will continue to defend against any attack.‚Äù

Both governments regularly accuse each other of nefarious activities and engage in propaganda.

The alleged Iranian cyber attack on the water plant could have triggered fail-safes that would have left tens of thousand of civilians and farms parched in the middle of an Israel heatwave, as the pumping station shut down when the excess chemical was detected. In the worst-case scenario, hundreds of people would have been at risk of becoming ill, said the western official, whose government was briefed on the attack.

‚ÄúIt was more sophisticated than they [Israel] initially thought,‚Äù the official said. ‚ÄúIt was close to successful, and it‚Äôs not fully clear why it didn‚Äôt succeed.‚Äù

Israel is now braced for further cyber attacks.

‚ÄúCyber winter is coming and coming even faster than I suspected,‚Äù Yigal Unna, the head of Israel‚Äôs National Cyber Directorate told a conference last week, without mentioning Iran‚Äôs alleged role in the suspected attack on the water station. ‚ÄúWe are just seeing the beginning ‚Äî we will remember this as a changing point in the history of modern cyber warfare.‚Äù

Israel officials said the Jewish state retaliated last month for the alleged Iranian attack.

Under orders from Naftali Bennett, then acting defence minister, Israel carried out a small, but sophisticated attack on the Shahid Rajaee Port, which handles nearly half of Iran‚Äôs foreign trade, according to two of the Israeli officials, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorised to discuss the issue in public.

‚ÄúIt was small, very small ‚Äî like a knock on the door,‚Äù said one official. ‚ÄúThink of it [as] a gentle reminder. ‚ÄòWe know where you live.‚Äô‚Äù

Neither Israel nor Iran have officially acknowledged targeting each other‚Äôs civilian infrastructure, nor have they publicly described the severity of the cyber attacks.

The Iranian regime insider said: ‚ÄúIranian ports are usually chaotic and disruptions happen.‚Äù

The Washington Post first reported the Israeli attack on the Iranian port, citing US intelligence officials. An Iranian government statement said Tehran was investigating the possibility of a cyber attack at the port.

Striking at Iranian civilian infrastructure was an escalation taken at the behest of Mr Bennett, who insisted on a visible response to the suspected attack on the water infrastructure, according to two Israeli officials. At the time, Mr Bennett‚Äôs tenure as caretaker defence minister was close to ending, as a new Israeli government had been agreed upon, but not sworn in.

Mr Bennett, who served in an elite military unit, and is considered more rightwing than prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, demanded a list of targets from the Israeli military, said two of the Israeli officials. His office declined to comment.

The Israel Defense Forces has a small cyber security unit specifically dedicated to probing enemy defences, including a still unclaimed attack using malware that ended up crippling Iran‚Äôs centrifuge program around 2010 that is widely attributed to Israel.

The port was ‚Äúroughly in the middle of the page of options,‚Äù said an Israeli official. ‚ÄúAny disruption would be economic, nobody‚Äôs safety would be placed at risk, they would be reminded we are here, we are watching.‚Äù

It is unclear how successful the attack was in disrupting the port‚Äôs activities, which are already chaotic due to sanctions that have crippled Iran‚Äôs economy. The western official said he was shown evidence of lines of trucks waiting to enter the port as the authorities sought to fix the damage.

‚ÄúSo Iran may have caused a temporary water shortage, and Israel may have caused a temporary traffic jam,‚Äù the official said. ‚ÄúIn the grand scheme of things, it‚Äôs nothing. But it never stops at that.‚Äù",True,False,False,,,0,1591012033,,False,0,{},fsinmas,True,t3_guj67f,False,True,t3_guj67f,/r/IntelligenceNews/comments/guj67f/israeliran_attacks_cyber_winter_is_coming/fsinmas/,False,,1596944381,1,True,False,IntelligenceNews,t5_3pmzv,r/IntelligenceNews,public,,0,[],

-Also research part is 1st person ""I am"", rest is 3rd person e.g. ""Created an open source pipeline to downsample 3D point clouds created from LiDAR scans displayed using Unity VR"", should be no I dids ever. Grammar and spelling are important for the dumbest of reasons, you have to remember there is someone underpaid doing the initial sift of CVs and they're bored out of their brain as all CVs are the same and they spend about 10 seconds having looking at each one and are just looking for any reason to put one above another. To you your CV is a pet, to them cattle.

-Decide what kinds of dev roles you're targeting have version for each: a backend core system one, a webapp fullstack type one, AI one

-Listing out all the subjects you did in your degree is overkill unless its relevant to the role you're going for, like if you're applying to Google Engineering and you did a module in compiler design cool, but Bank of X IT department not so much. No one will mark you down for this as this stage of you're career but when doing CVs always  think do I need this line, can the real estate be better used.

-Remember recruiters at the lower levels are basically human Regex expressions doing keyword pattern matching for commision, they don't know that if you know Java then you also can blag C#,C++, Kotlin or whatever.

-If you really like the look of a particular role, literally take the job description and rewrite your CV around it. How far you go is up to you, changing payment system to trading system to reporting systems etc might make all the difference. Java can turn to C# etc, if you get through to next round just cram for the tech interview.

-If you have a foreign sounding name, put ""Full right to live &amp; working in EU unsponsored"" down at the bottom. Just because you're not racist doesn't mean other people aren't and visa stuff is hassle.

Source for Ruthenian nobility is the fact that more than half of known Lithuanian noble families are in fact Ruthenian in origin. That includes Chodkiewicz, Oginski, Sapieha, Tyszkiewicz, Borkowski to name few.

Source for Ruthenian origin of GDL famous statutes is not only the language (Ruthenian) but also that their contents are based on old Rus' statutes, also known as ""ruskaja pravda"" which will become obvious if you will try reading them both. In fact, many parts are exact match.

GDL adopted Ruthenian titles as ""knyaz"", ""hetman"", ""boyar"" to name the better known. Most of which even have entered Lithuanian language itself.
In fact, as far as I know, there is not a single pre-renaissance historical source which calls any of Lithuanian rulers with any Lithuanian language-based title. GDL based sources, including the statutes, call the ruler ""velikij knyaz"" and country ""velikoye knyazstvo Litovskoje"".

Main language in a way that it was the language of court and majority of population. Lithuanian language was simply a vernacular which did not have any serious recognition back then. Same way as it was with practically all non written languages back then, which include English which did not have any recognition in England for more than 400 years when official language was French.


And in my opinion Scotland definitely is as much successor of British empire as England are. Because they obviously were an integrated and recognised part of the said entities titulary nation.

In reality, neither - nor Belarus, nor Lithuania are a real successor of GDL as lineage of succession was broken and there is nothing common between GDL and said countries juridically, ideologically or in any other way except some state symbols and matching territory. Just as it doesn't make a real sense to call Germany the successor of Holy Roman Empire because they share part of territory and the eagle or to call Romania the successor of the Roman empire because they share the name.

Slavery was not a concept that existed in these native cultures. 

They also did not fight other humans by principal. Which, was likely why they were sold into slavery by the English. They fought back when being massacred and raped by white colonists, sure... 

‚ÄúThe first slaves in the Americas were Native American and this business that the Native Americans died off as a result of disease and war [is inaccurate]‚Äîthose were not the only reasons for their demise, there was the Indian slave trade, which is something we do not discuss a lot.‚Äù - Dr. Arica Coleman ‚Äúthe Blood that Stay Pure‚Äù

Here‚Äôs a nice history lesson about the English‚Äôs first contact with the indigenous Australians:

‚ÄúAnother consequence of British colonisation was European seizure of land and water resources, with the decimation of kangaroo and other indigenous foodstuffs which continued throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries as rural lands were converted for sheep and cattle grazing. Settlers also participated in the rape and forcible prostitution of Aboriginal women.‚Äù

Lots of tribes counted only to 2 or 3. Anything more was ‚Äútoo many‚Äù. They didn‚Äôt feel they had the right to count, for only the Godhead or ‚Äúcounting god‚Äù had that right. Greed was not in ‚Äúnature‚Äù.

Instinctual survival is a thing, sure. If someone comes into your house to burn it, rapes your wife and tries to capture you to enslave you, would you defend yourself? This fear based defence only started when man became a great threat. These ideas of ‚Äúrape‚Äù, ‚Äúmurder‚Äù, ‚Äúslavery‚Äù, were unfathomable to the indigenous.

Saying these treacherous traits are in ‚Äúhuman nature‚Äù is a naive dismissal of these great problems. They do not belong in humanity, and I truly hope the world can see this eventually.

In fact, I loaded a backup save I made just before taking the MoH that I made in case I misunderstood its mechanics (you can never be too careful after spending 100 years doing ridiculous, stressful stuff in a challenge run).

If you didn't see that post: basically you no-CB and annex a Brazilian minor in colonial range, bankrupt off its province once all land is granted to vassals right before declaring a war in Europe to keep your allies, colonize to China, and then go to war with Ming for the mandate.

PHASE 1: UNIFYING CHINA

As we intend to keep the title of Emperor of China in this run rather than provoke the AI into usurping us, it's a great idea to actually be a good Emperor. That starts with taking Canton, Nanjing, and Beijing, each of which provides a ticking mandate penalty if the Emperor doesn't own *and* control it. So in the peace deal with Ming here, I took Nanjing and Canton on top of the Mandate, and I made sure to grab Beijing from the large neighboring Shun ASAP.

As the Emperor of china, you gain a handful of features that can be really helpful or really not. These were the focus of the run as I was constantly going to war with Chinese minors for a century until about 1635. I took advantage of a handful of things:

1.  The Unify China CB is ridiculous (50% cost, 150% prestige, and 50% AE for all provinces in China). I was constantly at war, taking 99% of overextension for ~68% warscore, leaving more than 30% for cash and miscellaneous demands. This was really important in keeping my economy afloat.

2. It's not actually all that hard to get to high mandate, provided you don't ever tank it for events or imperial reforms. 100 Mandate gives -2.5 national unrest, -10% stability cost modifier, and -0.03 ticking war exhaustion, which when combined with Humanist ideas is phenomenal at keeping an entire region full of non-accepted-culture, non-state-religion land happy with your Imperial reign.

3. Meritocracy bonuses can be quite helpful, especially the -10% dev cost + -10% core cost one.

4. Tributary states are a game-changer. With Exploration ideas, you can colonize every country-bordering uncolonized province in the game, and if you make the countries you briefly border happy with you, they'll gladly send you monetary or mana tribute every year for the rest of the game even if you lose your border. I was able to keep a large army and recklessly spend money on institutions and advisors, because large tributaries like Chagatai, Kilwa, and Venice would provide the bulk of the ~600 ducats (or like 35 admin/dip/mil) a year I was getting out of having Imperial tributaries.

PHASE 2: UNIFYING THE EMPIRE

So once all of the China region was taken (+ the one state in the Manchuria region that is charterable, I didn't want any AI European neighbors over there), it was time shift focus back to Europe. I began by taking Diplomatic ideas, but realized I needed to convert to Protestant to gain the favor of the electors. Despite being the Papal State tag, I could freely switch to protestant via the normal mechanics as I didn't have the Papacy government type.

At that point, it was a matter of making nice with electors, getting prestige up, and wondering what my legitimacy score was calculated off of for the purposes of the HRE election; it certainly wasn't Mandate or Meritocracy. Once elected, I set my sights on provinces in Europe that I could add for imperial authority -- I targetted the Ottomans first, who have a lot of land that HRE princes do not care if you annex. Using the power base I'd developed in China, I was able to raise an army to match theirs and cut a path from Lika to Constantinople+across the Sea of Marmara during the first war, then take more of the Balkans during the second and border Russia. From there on out, I rotated wars vs. The Ottomans, Russia, and any miscellaneous neighboring countries (poland was 98% warscore, which was nice) and allied any HRE countries with land outside the Empire (Bohemia, Switzerland, Sweden, and Pomerania).

During this span of time, I had a monthly ticking IA of either 0.0 or 0.10 during war/peace, so I added provinces to the HRE when I got them or when I converted them to Protestant if they started out Sunni (hence Religious Ideas 3).

After the second Ottoman war, I triggered and won Court and Country, which would have sent my country into permanent financial ruin if not for my large tributary network. I think this was worth it, as it represented a decent speeding up of the conquest for the run.

This series of wars eventually led to me getting the ~95 IA needed to convince former emperor Sweden to become my vassal, and from there it was easy to clean up borders and gain the necessary IA to press Renovatio Imperii -- and that was that.",True,False,False,,,0,1591017009,,1591106361,0,{},fsiubfr,True,t3_gujqay,False,False,t1_fsiqn2f,/r/eu4/comments/gujqay/the_holiest_roman_empire_youve_ever_seen_the/fsiubfr/,False,,1596947694,16,True,False,eu4,t5_2uqat,r/eu4,public,,0,[],

Here in France, we have also this defiance against police because of racist acts (hopefully not as many as in other places) and mostly for the way they treat protesters (mutilations have happened way too much with the Yellow Vest movement, which I participated to).

Police is the authority you are supposed to turn to when you need protection. When you see police brutality against people you compare yourself to, let's just say it makes people have noone to turn to in times of need. When you're a minority that's already feeling oppressed, I can only imagine how just another spark would lead to bigger riots.

Anger for being betrayed from those that sworn to defend you is pretty normal IMO. Generalization (even if I hate it) is also kind of explained by the fact the police forces never clean themselves. We (citizens) can hear everyone is not bad in the police, but if they don't single out and punish those bad ones, then it makes us think that the police can't make the difference between right or wrong when they investigate themselves.

I know I shouldn't expect to see the police force fix its issues online in a subreddit debate or even see pro police force talk about their issues. But when you compare the content of subs like this one or r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut you realize the gap between those protesting and those supporting police no matter what. 

&amp;#x200B;

To answer OP, u/mandolin6648, unless the police realizes they need to change, they just won't. In France, despite many videos and many witnesses of police brutality, nothing happened also because the politics behind not only supported the police but also gave them full access to the anti-riot tools even if the rioting only got up to one burnt car here and there and banks walls with graffitis and smashed doors.

With Trump's way of handling the situation, nothing will happen. Things would sadly need to escalate very very high for things to really happen.

It depends on how much you like medieval Europe! I have a history degree and focused a lot on European history during my studies so I find it to be really interesting and fun to play ""Europe, but the magic is real."" But the most important part of Ars to me is its dedication to the concept of playing a game as a wizard across a long span of time through its magic, Covenant, and aging systems.

Most of the principles should translate pretty smoothly to any given fantasy setting if you want them to. For example, wizards can still be distrusted because of The Gift and they can still be banned from meddling in politics using their magic (e.g. the ""no court wizards"" case law established on page 14 of the 5e core book). They can still be broken into Tribunals, they can still interact with religion as a real entity and delve into the philosophy of how separate their hermetic arts are from religious miracles (pending some changes given your setting wouldn't have the Roman church in it), and cities can still ruin magical auras and be poor places to set up magical residences. You may need to do slightly more work in dealing with the Infernal realm, which is rather directly based on the real-world cosmology of Christian Hell.

Basically the main thing you'd lose, aside from a niche appeal to history buffs like me, is that a lot of the adventures and setting materials outside the core book tie pretty closely to real historical events and places. But with a few judicious name changes even that could be overcome.

Hy everyone! New seller here, eager to do his first deal here on this sub!

Zenith's caliber 146D was the last chronograph movement produced until the introduction of the El Primero in 1969.

Overall, about 7/10 condition. It recently had a full service. The case and dial appear original. Case edges are nice and crisp. The dial does have some light spotting that is more noticeable indoors than out. The chronograph functions smoothly and as it should, resetting back to zero without issue. The crystal is clean and the watch keeps accurate time. It measures 35mm diameter without crown, 42mm lug to lug, and 18mm lug width.

I will send a watch in a watch box but I do not have the original one.

No one was paying attention in the crossroads of New York as I was giving my speech.

""M-m-mine...""

However, one person was intrigued in what I was saying.

""M-m-m-minecraft...""

Then it was just a domino effect, ten more people are watching.

""Minecraft...""

A hundred were now watching, this had caught the attention of even the busy drivers in rush hour. Their faces in anticipation, some were even scared. Others were complaining that this isn't the real deal.

""MINECRAFT...""

But they all suddenly started cheering, shaking, praying. When they heard my tone, my pitch, my timbre.... they all knew what was going to come next. They realized... that salvation of the human race has finally come.

""Minecraft good Fortnite bad""

And then the silence broke

""OOOIOIIUUUUUGHHHhJJHHHHHWAASEAAAa//::""

Thousands of people fell to their knees, yelling orgasmically. People starting crying tears of joy, others were running and thanking God, News reporters were already on the scene, broadcasting the entire thing nationwide and consequently the entire world. Hundreds of people came out of their cars, buses, taxis, stores, and subway stations hooting and hollering. It was a miracle unfolding.

I started to say the next sentence relayed to me by our Lord and Savior.

""M-m-mi... Mine...""

Already some people fainted at just the mere sound of my voice. Even more people came. Some were jumping from planes thousands of feet in the air, others ran or swam miles to here in mere seconds. I think I even spotted a few famous people.

""MINE...""

Nearly a million people were here now. There's now Europeans, Canadians, Mexicans, Latin Americans, West Coasters, Africans, and even several Asians and one Australian. They were screaming hysterically, bringing gifts for me, taking pictures and videos. Fireworks and confetti everywhere, helicopters, and even Donald Trump was here with his family bowing down to me.

""MINEC-C-C-CRAFT voice crack""

A billion people were here now. Even animals from all over the world were coming in herds. I could see Pewdiepie &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Martiza, Elon Musk, Keanu Reeves, Lil Nas X, 50 Cent, Oprah Winfrey, the Kardashians, and so many other people. Many people were having seizures, heart attacks, and strokes from the sheer excitement, and some were being trampled to death because of the huge crowd. The screaming was deafening. Some just came straight out of their bathroom, school, work, or their parenting... but it doesn't matter now.

""MMMMMMIIIIINNNNEEECRAAAFTTTTT""

No matter what was your race, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, religion, economic class, etc... it didn't matter. All of humanity has come together for this one moment. Millions of people have died to due plane crashes, car crashes, doctors abandoning their patients, parents abandoning their children... just to be here, but it will all be worth it.

Nearly half of humanity is here now. Even the dead came out their graves for this. Everyone is climbing on top of each other and on the walls of skyscrapers since they couldn't fit. So many lights, music, dancing, feasts... yet barely a minute passed. Humanity is very interesting.

10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

I look at the smiling faces of the crowd in front of me. I look at the death and destruction that came from sacrifice to attend this event. This is it. We're ready.

Billions of people around the world disintegrated into their pure chemical compounds that composed their bodies, then their atoms, then their protons/neutrons/electrons, and finally their quarks... as they heard that holy sentence. The distant echoes of yelling can heard from thousands of miles. This... this was their ultimate purpose in life. This is the culmination of everything that has happened in human history, it is reason why life even existed in the first place. They weren't screaming in terror, they were shouting in orgasmic joy. They could finally die happy. Their entire lives flashed before their eyes as they saw their loved ones. They saw their ultimate fantasy. They can finally be freed from their imperfect bodies in this imperfect world.

The Sun blinked out. The Moon crashed into the Earth. The Earth turned into dust. The Solar System collapsed into a state of entropy. The Milky Way hosts a firework show of supernovas. All the galaxies of the universe colliding with one another. Reality is falling apart. That's because reality doesn't need to exist anymore. It has reached its goal. Spacetime has fallen. Matter ceases to exist. Not even the concept of nothing exists. The universe was never born.

Humanity is gone. Everything is gone. We are now one. Evil doesn't exist anymore. Insecurities don't exist anymore. Fear, sadness, anger don't exist anymore. Just hope, love, and harmony for eternity. This is what we were meant to be. This is our final evolution stage.

This is heaven. This is what it means to be happy.

This is a genuine, honest and transparent response from a human being. Yes, Georgia has been able to partially open back up a few weeks ago. First of all - not everything is really open: many many stores are still closed. Best Buy is a good example (they only have curbside).

However, three things have happened:

\- Due to COVID and GA shutdown (but similar story in our UK facility), we had to shutdown a big amount of our operations for several weeks - with only a skeleton crew shipping pre-built controllers, accessories, and receiving inventory), creating a backlog for new orders and repairs that we're working tirelessly to catch up on (and doing so).

\- Due to a majority of the population being home (not just in the US, but worldwide), we've had increased demand that was something no one could have planned, and that also translated to a huge increase in ticket volume. With operations being slower, demand higher, transitioning employees and systems to WFH (+ of course not being able to on-board new employees to cope with the increased volume in a middle of a global pandemic), in order to ensure we can actually process all requests, we've moved everything to tickets and are currently clearing through the backlog. Again - the CS team is working hard on that, but it doesn't help when someone creates 3 separate tickets for the same issue and floods the system even more. Once we've caught up, I'm sure we'll open the phone lines as soon as possible.

\- Due to everyone being home, people have been gaming a lot more, thus, wearing their controllers faster, we've also had more repair requests, but our factory was shut down so we couldn't get controllers back. In the case of Europe, a lot of shipping carriers also no longer offered pick up or drop off for repairs too, creating an other backlog there that's completely outside of our control.

I genuinely understand your frustration, and we've repeatedly offered you our help via our reddit mods, and are doing so as much as we can here, so please bare with us as we deal with an un-precedented situation and I can ensure you - we have a lot of people working really hard to work through all backlog.",True,False,False,,,0,1591021584,,1591021885,0,{},fsj1um0,False,t3_grtfk9,False,True,t1_fs10mhq,/r/scufgaming/comments/grtfk9/controller_triggers/fsj1um0/,False,,1596951319,1,True,False,scufgaming,t5_345qp,r/scufgaming,public,,0,[],

&gt;Currently, a chemical under intense scrutiny is RoundUp, which has a bunch of problems of its own (including the possibility for pesticide-resistance and decimation of beneficial insects in the ecosystem).

An herbicide is 'decimating' beneficial insects? You sure about that?

&gt;they are actively eliminating biodiversity of plants by pushing limited strains. For example, 95% of bannanas are identical and could be wiped out by one disease - while GMO could help save the bannana, companies like Monsanto take advantage of situations like these and replace 1 strain with another, as to retain their monopoly. 

GMOs aren't clones. They don't reduce biodiversity because there aren't fewer GMO strains when compared to their non-GMO counterparts. 

You're repeating an unfounded myth with no basis in reality. 

&gt;Independent farmers often save seeds from their crop one year and plant the same ones the next, saving seed-buying costs and growing sustainably.

Modern commercial farmers haven't done this for decades. Not since the introduction of hybridization and the associated yield gains. 

This is a talking point repeated by people who have no understanding of farming. 

https://www.thefarmersdaughterusa.com/2016/02/no-farmers-dont-want-save-seeds.html

&gt;However, when farmers use Monsanto's plants, which are engineered to produce unviable seeds

Nope. No seeds have been engineered to be sterile. You seem to be hitting all of the easily debunked lies and misinformation.

&gt;In addition, if the GMO seeds are used again the next year, farmers are forced to pay a fee due to patent laws.

This isn't remotely a thing. And you need to consider your own beliefs here. If the seeds *were* sterile, how could they be planted the next year at all?

&gt;It's kind of messed up how companies like Monsanto lobby congress as well, allowing laws like these to be put into place.

What laws are you referring to? Farmers sign a contract to not save seed. There's no lobbying needed. 

Seriously, you should listen to farmers themselves.

And now you cite the most discredited person ever when talking about GMOs. Did you know that Seralini is secretly funded by homeopathic corporations?

&gt;Competing interests

&gt;The authors declare that they have no competing interests.

Let's see. Do you think being paid to come up with a homeopathic ""glyphosate detox"" product is a competing interest? Because anyone with a shred of common sense would say so. But you seem to find this charlatan credible.

After WW2, the USA was practically the only world superpower that hadn't experienced warfare within its borders. As a result, our manufacturing and transportation systems made it uniquely profitable to various industries. The economy boomed and created an era of unsustainable wealth.

For white people. 

During the 50's, POC  were still subjugated by redlining and discriminatory laws that exluded them from this boom, both in the north and especially in the south. The US was continuously engaged in coups and destabilization in South America to maximize our interests at the costs of hispanic lives. That's not to mention women's rights issues, as this was pre Roe v. Wade and divorce was more taboo, and the dismal state of LGBT rights back then.

Also note that, athetical to conservative dogma, this boom was when the US had record-high corporate taxes and taxes for the rich, lessening the burden on the low and middle classes.

So for those who personally experienced this time (I'm not one of them), the implicit fact is that the prosperity of that time was limited to heteronormitive European American nuclear families, and was only possible due to systematic subjugation of minority groups.

A non-zero percentage of MAGA people know all of the above and want it anyway, which is impossible without bringing back discriminatory policies or some sort of ethnostatism.

Some of my closest friends are immigrants from several European countries, one owns his own business and the others work in decent jobs and contribute to the economy much more than several people I know who preach your rhetoric. One of my former employers was an immigrant who sold his business for many millions. He came to this country not even knowing the language looking for a better life and managed it with great success. Our problems are more systemic than mere immigration.

Nationalism does nothing more than divide us.

One person I know who hates immigrants is a brick layer and handyman who complains that he is constantly undercut while basically only taking cash in hand jobs and paying virtually no tax.

I lived in and worked in an area with a lot of immigration in the past and the people I met were generous hard working and very pleasant people.

I always wonder how a country such as the USA for example that was built on immigration is now so hostile to it. 

People are the same the world over they just want a better life if not for themselves then for their children. The UK can provide that and they are willing to work hard to do so. 

You could argue it was the right that destroyed the working class cities by destroying manufacturing and moving out over seas. 

I'm a 'moderate' so the left and right hate me equally, there are policies from both sides I would agree with. 

Austerity and the right has done nothing but increase the divide in our society, both economically and socially. 

Why don't we tackle the spiralling cost of housing, the children born into poverty in areas neglected for decades set to repeat the cycle? Why not tackle our crumbling infrastructure? Why not stop the corporations being able to get away with paying virtually no tax while cuts are made everywhere. 

London is one of the most diverse cities on earth with people from all over the world and despite this is also one of the richest. 

From my experience in life so far immigration has done nothing but bring new businesses and people willing to work hard to get ahead for themselves and their kids.

One look at the history of the 20th century tells me nationalism ends in nothing but problems. 

That's my thoughts. Your opinion would hold more water with me if you didn't suggest it with such a condescending and insulting tone. Might I add that a lot of the people I know who also hold your views are particularly unpleasant people because of this.

Most of the smear is based on an interview where he said he experienced/witnessed evil while posing as the godson of a Hungarian official. 

It's more than a stretch to refer to him as a collaborator, it's a disgusting smear. As much as I don't like Soros or the politicians he backs, but by any honest accounting, he would be considered a Holocaust survivor. He was in his early teens and hiding from the Nazis. Had his identity been discovered he would have been murdered along with nearly a half a million other Hungarian Jews.

QAnon &amp; MAGA chuds have said things to me like: ""You participate in confiscation..you are a collaborator""

But he wasn't a participant in the confiscation, he was a kid who was posing as someone's godson who happened to be involved in confiscations. They weren't even in the midst of confiscating the property, as the Arrow Cross already had the estate in question in their possession. The official had to travel to Iregszemcse, 150km outside of Budapest, to itemize the estate. The official was to be gone for three days, so he brought young Soros with him. 

The family whose estate was being inspected had signed over ownership of the estate to the SS in return for their safe passage to Portugal. The owner of the home would eventually relocate to the U.S. and die of natural causes in the late 1960s. But I suppose MAGA conspiracy folk would consider those Jews collaborators, too, seeing as the Nazis benefitted materially from the deal they cut with them.

Soros is one of many billionaire capitalists who uses his money to influence politics,. The reason he is focused on because he is the most high-profile capitalist who happens to throw some money at progressive causes (these are then spun into hysterical fantasies about him directly hiring ANTIFA thugs to interrupt campus appearances by various clickbait propagandists (who then position themselves as freedom of speech warriors, capitalizing on their phony status as 'rebels' or 'resistance').    


That Soros is Jewish helps give credence to the Soros Puppetmaster conspiracy theories (though chuds seem perfectly capable of blocking out Sheldon Adelson, the Mercer family, etc.) as none of the deranged ideas (like those in the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion, etc.) that made their way into the ideology of the NSDAP (or Russian Empire or Henry Ford) ever fully dissipated.   


For years prior to Trump's election RT comments sections were overflowing with frothing with antisemitic conspiracy theories about Angela Merkel being a crypto-Jew or the daughter of Hitler (who, it was claimed, worked for the Jewish cabal) who was working to destroy the fabric of Christian-European society by letting Muslim migrants and refugees in to rape white women (itself an old Nazi trope). Who was behind Merkel in these fantasies but George Soros? The same Soros, it was claimed, that was behind the promotion of ""Cultural Marxism"" (also a Nazi trope, they referred to it as ""Cultural Bolshevism""). As with the Nazi propaganda that claimed that the Jews were the puppetmasters of capitalism AND communism, the billionaire capitalist Soros is projected as a communist (which is conflated with globalism). I don't like Soros either, but the suggestions that billionaire capitalist Soros is promoting left-wing socialism or is a ""literal Nazi"" (the opposite of left-wing or socialist) is patently absurd.  


That the Viktor Orban government has promoted anti-Soros conspiracies is also unsurprising. The nationalists in Hungery aren't exactly honest about their own history. I visited Hungary a few years ago and was shocked by the revisionism that dominated their museums and memorials. There are plenty of Hungarians who are aware of the truth and have erected displays to counter the warped history promoted by officialdom, but they don't hold the levers of power.  


Nationalists like to pretend that they were victims of the Nazis and that they came into the country and killed all the Jews. They will minimize involvement and claim that only a small minority of Hungarians in the fascist Arrow Cross Party helped in the deportation of  440,000 Hungarian Jews in only 55 days between May 1944 and July 1944. This is partly true, but does not alter the fact that Hungarian nationalists helped murder nearly half a million Jews.  


More importantly, they ignore that this was essentially an extension of the policies of the previous conservative nationalist government of Miklos Horthy. The same happened in Vichy France and other nations allied to the Axis powers or occupied by them: they always started with foreign Jews. Also, Horthy passed antisemitic laws long before Hitler came around. He knowingly expelled 18,000 foreign Jews into SS hands for extermination in August 1941, culminating in the Kamianets-Podilskyi Massacre, one of the first mass killings of the Holocaust.

    Server = https://manjaro.moson.eu/arm-stable/$repo/$arch

and that allowed me to update ... once. Because what the dude didn't think through is that there is a known issue with the backwards compat wireless card drivers, so updating led to a dead network card after reboot.

So what I ended up doing was downloading and installing the 20.04 i3 release (that  hadn't known existed when I wrote the original post, because I followed links from the Pine64 pages. 20.04 also has fixed wi-fi driver). Now, I am not a fan of i3 and that hasn't changed. The hurdle here was that the installer either doesn't set screen brightness or does set it but sets it so low that it defaults to 0.2 (ie 20%).  ***So I couldn't see anything on the screen without squinting really hard.*** The way to set it via commnad line is with xrandr, but xrandr can't get the screen name on a Pinebook, so i3 was a useless pile of poo.

i3 has no working slider or icon in the panel for brightness, I had 4 terminal windows open before I even realised the kb command was working. I had to guess type to open a terminal and then guess type install xfce.

With that done and almost able to see enough of the screen to log out, change session to use xfce and log back in, and then use the panel slider to adjust the brightness enough to actually see the screen.

So, I did eventually manage a working xfce  install.

* proofing - i used a heat gun to measure temp in my cold oven - it's about 80-85%. 2 hours in that oven is good for the final prove... with minimal butter melting

That's my problem with Chief in Halo 4, his arc in the game is actively at odds with his depiction in the books. Halo 4 doesn't make Chief like his characterization in the novels, it outright contradicts it. 

The Master Chief, Spartan-IIs in general, have *never* questioned their humanity because nothing about their depictions in the EU ever suggested that the Spartans were at odds with their humanity. In fact it's quite the opposite, Spartan-IIs routinely demonstrate behavior that would support them being fully human. They laugh and make, tease one another, 

The singular time a Spartan-II did question her humanity, it was because she was feeling immense guilt for killing an entire planet. And even then, the fact that she felt guilt at all is evidence enough that she does have humanity, otherwise she wouldn't have felt guilt for essentially committing genocide. 

Before Chief essentially had two characterizations, how he acted in the original trilogy and how he acted in the EU. Post Halo 4 he has *three* main characterizations: how he acts in the original trilogy, how he acts in the EU and how he acts in Halo 4.

Because it's not like anything published after Halo 4 builds towards his characterization in it. Even in media that takes place before Halo 4, where it would make sense to retcon in Chief wrestling with his humanity, Chief is written to be in line with his EU characterization. In fact I'd argue that the post Halo 4 works lean into that aspect of his character a bit more (although that's also because Silent Storm, Collateral Damage and Oblivion are far more focused on the Chief than the Nylund trilogy was).

And even then, I only differentiate the EU and the original trilogy because people view them differently. Unlike Halo 4, the original trilogy and the EU can successfully coexist with one another as valid depictions of the Chief. Unlike Halo 4, the original trilogy, whether it was intended to or not, justifies Chief difference in personality by putting him in situations where the story isn't able to conflict with the EU. We don't get Chief's internal monologue in the games and we don't have other Spartans for him to interact with and those were the two primary ways to showcase Chief's character at the time. There's Johnson, but that was also before Johnson's role as one of Chief's mentors and their 3 decade long history together was ever established.

Both matches were fine margins. While Chelsea should have won, it was mostly a bunch of peno calls that Barcelona got away with. Largely individual errors. 

United had a few problems coming into that final. Rio injury and the bogus fletcher suspension were two big ones. Fergie fucked up his tactics too. He abandoned the midfield battle and went for Park over old Scholes. And Ronaldo absolutely fucked it up in the final. I mean, the posession was equal against a tiki taka Barcelona. United were far better than given credit for. Understandably so. That was Pep's first season and tiki taka was really oppressive. 

If United and Chelsea played in the semis, I actually suspect United would have won. Fergie was always brilliant against English opposition.

I am afraid, there is no way to anticipate, if a revolution is successful or not. It mostly depends on certain factors: How many people have weapons? Are they willing to use them? How desperate are they? How organized are they? Do real mighty people expect to get better along for more money/stability/resources/influence with the old regime or the new one? Is there support from the public opinion? Is there a leader/opponent who is willing to sacrifice everybody? How old (and incrusted) is the system?

If you do decide to pursue a degree in a non-English speaking country, you should absolutely learn the language, but you don‚Äôt need to have it mastered before you move there. If you don‚Äôt already know a language, I‚Äôd recommend you apply only to English degrees. Another thing to keep in mind is what you want to study: there are many Englis-speaking degrees offered for things like business, political science, and STEM, but few for other types of degrees.

Language skills are especially important for admin stuff (getting a visa, finding housing/signing paperwork, getting a bank account), performing day-to-day activities (ie grocery shopping), and making friends. 

The language barrier is certainly something you‚Äôd need to work to overcome, but it‚Äôs definitely not impossible, and friends you make in university will probably be willing to help develop your language skills and help with paperwork etc. The uni I attend offers French up to the C2 level, and people in the English speaking track have to take English their first semester even if they already are fluent in French. 

One thing I recommend you absolutely review about a program or uni before you enroll is research the pedagogic format. The style of learning, assignments expected, and schedule format can all vary widely from university to university and will most likely be very different from an American style. For example, instead of the American thesis-style essay, in France the main essay style is very different and revolves around a central probl√©matique. 

As for after your degree after university, it depends a lot on what you what to do. You can certainly apply to grad schools, there are lots of highly rated universities in the EU for many subjects. If you‚Äôre worried about employment and you don‚Äôt want to get a masters or a PHD, then look into dual degrees. A lot of times, you‚Äôll get reduced tuition for half of your degree, but you‚Äôll still have an American degree to show to employers. Look into dual ba degrees if you‚Äôre worried about employment in the US (not an unwarranted concern, people in the US know Oxbridge in Europe and that‚Äôs usually it). 

Finally, you have to consider what it will logistically mean to be going to university in Europe. You‚Äôll miss Thanksgiving. Your winter/spring breaks won‚Äôt align with your American friends. You probably will only fly back over the winter break, so you‚Äôll go for months without seeing people back home. Can you deal with that?   
European universities also have a much more hands-off approach to student life, so clubs will be student run, most student activities will probably include (legal, often heavy) drinking, and you‚Äôll have to find housing for yourself and cook for yourself. Also, it will definitely be more difficult to find mental health support if you do struggle with academics or living in a foreign country. 

Emotionally, you need to be more mature than your American-university-attending peers, ready to be intrinsically motivated, and confident in your self-reliance. I have loved attending uni in France, it has challenged me immeasurably and now I‚Äòm more self reliant than my friends who have gone to American schools.

Fait : Nous sommes en r√©cession (2 trimestres √† la suite o√π le PIB baisse).  
Cons√©quences :   


* Impact sur l'emploi &amp; donc sur les recettes fiscales
* C√¥t√© business, changement  probable de dogme √† venir : tentatives de relocalisation, de  d√©mondialisation. r√©duction des couts &amp; profits ne seront plus les priorit√©s, d'o√π un impact sur la rentabilit√© des actions (dividendes), et donc sur leurs prix. 
* La dette des √©tats, d√©j√† tr√®s endett√©s va exploser (c'est en cours). l'aust√©rit√© n'est pas une option cette fois-ci. l'autre option, c'est de mon√©tiser la dette (= cr√©ation de monnaie par la BCE pour financer les √©tats). 
* D√©flation ou stagnation sauf inflation cibl√©e sur les produits tr√®s demand√©s dans les prochains moins. Pour les autres produits, les prix n'augmentent pas, et donc le revenu des salari√©s &amp; actionnaires non plus. 
* Beaucoup d'entreprises vont faire faillite du fait du choc de demande n√©gatif d√©j√† en cours --&gt; ch√¥mage. Il va y avoir des d√©fauts de cr√©dit en masse chez les particuliers et chez les entreprises (dangereux du fait de la propagation dans les r√©seaux fournisseur - clients)
* Il y aura un choix politique √† faire entre le nombre d'entreprises qu'on laisse faire faillite &amp; l'intensit√© de l'inflation (si l'on distribue trop d'argent)
* Les assureurs sont en danger (ils √©mettent les swaps, des produits d√©riv√©s qui permettent de se couvrir contre le risque), en cas de faillite, les banques sont en danger car les instruments de couverture qu'ils ach√®tent aux assureurs ne marchent alors plus. Il faut savoir que la France a les plus grosses banques d'Europe, elles repr√©sentent une grosse part de son √©conomie
* La bulle de l'immobilier risque d'√©clater, car les taux vont augmenter pour compenser le co√ªt du risque et les conditions se durcir dans un contexte difficile
* En r√©sum√©, on revient dans un contexte √† risque pour quelques ann√©es avec de la volatilit√© :)

A hundred were now watching, this had caught the attention of even the busy drivers in rush hour. Their faces in anticipation, some were even scared. Others were complaining that this isn't the real deal.

""MINECRAFT...""

But they all suddenly started cheering, shaking, praying. When they heard my tone, my pitch, my timbre.... they all knew what was going to come next. They realized... that salvation of the human race has finally come.

""Minecraft good Fortnite bad""

And then the silence broke

""OOOIOIIUUUUUGHHHhJJHHHHHWAASEAAAa//::""

Thousands of people fell to their knees, yelling orgasmically. People starting crying tears of joy, others were running and thanking God, News reporters were already on the scene, broadcasting the entire thing nationwide and consequently the entire world. Hundreds of people came out of their cars, buses, taxis, stores, and subway stations hooting and hollering. It was a miracle unfolding.

I started to say the next sentence relayed to me by our Lord and Savior.

""M-m-mi... Mine...""

Already some people fainted at just the mere sound of my voice. Even more people came. Some were jumping from planes thousands of feet in the air, others ran or swam miles to here in mere seconds. I think I even spotted a few famous people.

""MINE...""

Nearly a million people were here now. There's now Europeans, Canadians, Mexicans, Latin Americans, West Coasters, Africans, and even several Asians and one Australian. They were screaming hysterically, bringing gifts for me, taking pictures and videos. Fireworks and confetti everywhere, helicopters, and even Donald Trump was here with his family bowing down to me.

""MINEC-C-C-CRAFT voice crack""

A billion people were here now. Even animals from all over the world were coming in herds. I could see Pewdiepie \&amp;amp;amp;amp; Martiza, Elon Musk, Keanu Reeves, Lil Nas X, 50 Cent, Oprah Winfrey, the Kardashians, and so many other people. Many people were having seizures, heart attacks, and strokes from the sheer excitement, and some were being trampled to death because of the huge crowd. The screaming was deafening. Some just came straight out of their bathroom, school, work, or their parenting... but it doesn't matter now.

""MMMMMMIIIIINNNNEEECRAAAFTTTTT""

No matter what was your race, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, religion, economic class, etc... it didn't matter. All of humanity has come together for this one moment. Millions of people have died to due plane crashes, car crashes, doctors abandoning their patients, parents abandoning their children... just to be here, but it will all be worth it.

Nearly half of humanity is here now. Even the dead came out their graves for this. Everyone is climbing on top of each other and on the walls of skyscrapers since they couldn't fit. So many lights, music, dancing, feasts... yet barely a minute passed. Humanity is very interesting.

10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

I look at the smiling faces of the crowd in front of me. I look at the death and destruction that came from sacrifice to attend this event. This is it. We're ready.

Billions of people around the world disintegrated into their pure chemical compounds that composed their bodies, then their atoms, then their protons/neutrons/electrons, and finally their quarks... as they heard that holy sentence. The distant echoes of yelling can heard from thousands of miles. This... this was their ultimate purpose in life. This is the culmination of everything that has happened in human history, it is reason why life even existed in the first place. They weren't screaming in terror, they were shouting in orgasmic joy. They could finally die happy. Their entire lives flashed before their eyes as they saw their loved ones. They saw their ultimate fantasy. They can finally be freed from their imperfect bodies in this imperfect world.

The Sun blinked out. The Moon crashed into the Earth. The Earth turned into dust. The Solar System collapsed into a state of entropy. The Milky Way hosts a firework show of supernovas. All the galaxies of the universe colliding with one another. Reality is falling apart. That's because reality doesn't need to exist anymore. It has reached its goal. Spacetime has fallen. Matter ceases to exist. Not even the concept of nothing exists. The universe was never born.

Humanity is gone. Everything is gone. We are now one. Evil doesn't exist anymore. Insecurities don't exist anymore. Fear, sadness, anger don't exist anymore. Just hope, love, and harmony for eternity. This is what we were meant to be. This is our final evolution stage.

This is heaven. This is what it means to be happy.

This is why ships like Alabama and Kidd have the same camo. It's simply a representation of what was used at the time (in this case, Measure 22).

Bernie's policies are considered solidly left wing in Europe; I have no idea where Bernie's policies are considered anything else. Maybe in Venezuela, his policies might be ""centrist"" or in the failing economies of Spain, France and Italy they might be only ""centre-left"". The better an economy gets, the more 'left wing"" his policies become, I'm sure you might have observed this. **Policies should never be made in favor of renters, but home owners**, which is what the US prides itself on. **US has 73.5% white home ownership rate, and a 67% overall home ownership rate, higher than any Western European country and most American homes are actual houses, not apartments; most countries in the EU have a sub 5% home ownership rate if you only count detached housing and non leaseholds. Almost all apartments are leaseholds and have a 100-year lifespan before they get knocked down. Moreover,** the US should seek to increase that to over 80-90%. Home ownership builds wealth and prevents state dependency while ensuring economic productivity. Even Biden's ""housing policy"" is in realizing how retarded rent control is. It is an abjectly selfish policy to push for rent control and it goes against the common good of the middle class and upper class. Rent control ONLY assists the least productive members of society and harms everyone else. Rent control, in a hilarious enough way, is seen as one of the worst forms of economic rent seeking. **Most economists agree on this, it's a consensus issue:** [**rent control is retarded**](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/09/19/rent-control-will-make-housing-shortages-worse)**.** 
2. Depends what you consider ""acceptable living"". [**Most Poor Americans actually live lives identical to middle class Europeans**](https://fee.org/articles/the-poorest-20-of-americans-are-richer-than-most-nations-of-europe/)**;** **living in a project with medicaid in an ""inner city"" is exactly how Europeans live.** The INEQUALITY and effort put into said life is more in the US, maybe. But the lifestyle exactly is identical. Its just that America is more inequal, and people are naturally envious. **Poor Americans are JEALOUS, to put it simply, because the rich in America own houses and Teslas and the super rich own private jets and yachts.** In Europe, the poor European will get to live in a rent controlled apartment in the city center of Berlin with the same rent, forever, will be materially actually slightly poorer than the equal American, but the rich European will be regulated and taxed into being forced to live in an apartment as well, just to pay rents and live only marginally better in a similar location. Meanwhile the poor American will live in an irrelevant city making slightly more money and paying much less rent, while the rich American can afford to own an apartment in Manhattan.
3. Since you're here in Munich too, why don't you stop lying to everyone here and explain the fact it takes 1 hour to get from a place like Mittersendling to Olympiazentrum, minimum. Especially given the walking time to U-Bahn stations, and the switch ups necessary to go from U-6 to U-3 and so on? Or the fact that people here who can afford to, still buy a BMW so they dont waste 1 hour taking third world tier transport to go 10-15km? Also you're wrong, the US has comprehensive bus public transit by law covering nearly every 1 square mile of space in urban areas. I lived there, I know. Its just that literally ZERO Americans would tolerate taking 1 hour to go 10km. While people here happily do. The reason you'd make barely anything is German costs of living and car costs, in the US car costs are extremely low. Blame the ""green new deal"" for this. I worked as a software engineer in the US, I was making $100k net. Here I work as a SWE, I make $52k gross, roughly. Im making $33k net. And post rent I save $200 a month. In the US I was saving about $5500 a month. Let that sink in. Isarcard here is $60 for within the M-Zone, but I live outside the M-Zone and it costs $150 a month. $1800 a month on a fucking train that takes forever. In the US I was spending roughly $250 a month including gas and insurance. So I was spending $100 more monthly for a car I actually owned and convenience I had 100x more and I could go ANYWHERE with no limits. 
4. **Germany has UBI it is Hartz IV ALG II, anyone can be a NEET and live at home and shop for for for 200 euro a week**, have rent covered for a studio apartment and play video games all day and get paid for it by the German government because **you get statutory 432 + rent + heating** without preconditions. If you strategize with a girlfriend and get a union it doubles the sum. This is the problem, these shitty programs take up so much money that is the reason our tax system is so high. Pensions are already high due to the retiring boomers and they add in these dumb welfare programs. **It's not a BIT LESS for middle class, stop lying, look at the graph its THIRTY PERCENT**, that is the amount spent on housing. **THIRTY PERCENT IS HUGE. That is the difference between Italy and Poland in avg incomes**.  "" you are right people in higher income stratas in europe will probably pay more in taxes than in the states "" [In the US THIRTY PERCENT of the households earns more than $100k a year](https://www.census.gov/content/census/en/library/publications/2018/demo/p60-263.html), in Germany its THREE PERCENT.  Literally 80-90% of society is worse off here and I find it extremely irritating that Germans here are blind to how worse off they are. **You think renting an apartment, paying your landlord, and never being able to own anything is ""good"" lifestyle?** **It's the lifestyle of a slave**, except you are enslaved here to both the unproductive rent seeking poor and the unproductive government socialists.  "" give up on owning the newest porsche for last years model "" **Again stop fucking lying, jesus. Why do people here always do this? Its not a porsche, most people here cant even own their own fucking house or a 100m2 apartment, let alone a car. Most Germans have no savings, and you are fine with this so ""NEETs"" can do nothing and play video games all day? I am not, I am going to leave to Switzerland in 3 months, have fun as this shitty system collapses.

&gt; There was no production of jeans in the Soviet Union, but like all their peers abroad, Soviet youth wore jeans. The price was 180‚Äì250 rubles for a pair depending on the brand, which was almost twice as much as the monthly wage of an entry-level engineer. A visiting nurse charged 1 ruble for one injection if a patient lived below the fifth floor. The price reached 1.5 rubles for patients who lived on the fifth floor and up. A plumber happily repaired a faucet for just a bottle of vodka.

This wasn't a magic scenario where a plumber just barters away vodka for a service or good. Again, this is exactly how bartering looked under feudalism too--the important thing to note is that these transactions actually **required** the existence of money, which all the items kind of refer to for their value. Feudal peasants in Europe still used the old Roman Empire currency system if and when they bartered (as in, ""this thing is worth **BLAH** amount of Roman silver coins, your thing is worth **BLAH** amount of Roman silver coins"") it was usually in reference to the money system.

Like, we know for a fact that the amount of coins that circulated in feudal Europe was WAAAAAAAAAY below the amount of wealth that actually circulated in the economies of Europe at the time. We also know for a fact that peasants would rarely if ever actually **use** coin--but they still depended on it heavily, because it aided referencing value in other situations, such as bartering.

Similarly, your scenario is that in the USSR there was WAAAAY less of actual concrete money than the transactions actually circulating would suggest.

The campaign map is larger. Way larger. There is both more detail and regions than can be found in Vanilla M2:TW, in addition to having the game map expanded eastward past the Caucusus and the Caspian Sea. The eastern edge of the map is therefore deeper into Russia, and includes a large chunk of Persia. Further south includes almost all of the Arabian peninsula. The Aztecs and the Americas have been removed.

-There are new factions. Aragon, Genoa (replaces Milan), Norway, the Teutonic Order*, the Kievan Rus, the Cumans, the Crusader States, and Khwarezmia, and two starting times of the Campaign: 1100 or 1220. *Teutons are only in the late start game.

-You can play as the Mongols if you choose the option of a Late start campaign.

-More diverse and historical unit rosters. Many units have been retextured and some entirely new. This is especially true for the Eastern European factions. Some units from the Kingdoms expansion have been included.

-Heavy cavalry got buffed to be even more devastating in a charge. Knights are nasty but a limited resource because:

-""Real Recruitment"" is one of the submods that is on by default. This makes the unit pool replenish much slower, especially for elite units. Certain units can only be recruited in certain regions, and higher tech units cannot be recruited until certain dates throughout the game. So even if you somehow have a maxed out citadel with every building in 1200, you can't build a 16th century pike army with plate armor. This is my favorite of the smaller features.

-Time rate per turn is switched to a slower pace (I believe it is a year/turn). The game also ends way later in the early 1600s. Therefore the Campaign is much longer. I have yet to progress even close to that.

-Population growth is much slower and high taxes can be devastating to the long term success of your regions.

-""Army Resupply System"" is another submod included by default. I personally play with this feature off as I found it to be buggy/unpolished but I may give it another shot in the near future as this was a couple releases ago that I last played it.

-Agents seem to be buffed a bit, especially princesses, in the sense that they start with higher experience than in Vanilla. Enemy generals will actually want to marry into your family.

-A ton of new character traits and retinues are added. In addition ""Titles"" from M1:TW have been added to the game as a part of this increase. For example if you move a general to Bordeaux the next turn or so he will receive the title of ""Duke of Aquitaine,"" given that he doesn't already have a title and another character doesn't also already have that specific title.

-Forts are small castles

-Gates spew out burning oil like in R:TW and Kingdoms.

-Regions actually have names instead of just the city like they did in R:TW.

-Campaign AI. You have an option to choose from 3 AI submods, each one differing mostly in aggression level. I play with the moderate one and the CAI seems much better.

-Battle AI seems slightly better. I have actually lost to the AI in battles I should have won by underestimating them. But don't get too excited; it's still a TW game.

-Pathfinding is still utter shit in sieges.

It is completely fine to go from one perfect interval (the unison here) into another perfect interval (the P5) and again into the octave. However, this is only allowed if the motion is contrary motion. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. Now, in 2-voice counterpoint, the harmonic interval of a P4 is not acceptable, since it is not a very nice harmony (melodically it is excellent, and actually the strongest melodic leap we have in classical Western European music). Now in this case, the unison moves into the P4, by contrary motion, however, the P4 immediately goes into the P5. So the P4 is 'in passing'. Whenever we deal with dissonances, we use them in passing. Yes it is on the downbeat, however, our ears hear this pass onto the P5 (you may have dissonance on or off the beat). Then into the octave, again, in contrary motion which is perfectly fine. 

I hope this sheds some light on the situation. I may create a video specifically on this topic, and a few more rules and details regarding 2, 3 or 4 voice counterpoint, motion, and context in regard to dissonances in passing.

&gt;Secondly, would you compare life expectancy between a poor and rich country ? Stop coping and compare what's comparable. Anyway, even if whites have more T than most of other ethnic groups, they certainly don't beat blacks in this field.

Oh now it's the comparison that's getting in the way of your argument. Lmao stop swollowing words.

&gt;Blacks have higher T than any other ethnic group. People are ready to say black females are too masculine, yet they contest the fact black men are the most masculine. JFL... the cope is insane...

It might have something to do with their bone structure but honestly at this point trying to reason with a person who tries to use the fact that some mamals with darker fur have a slightly higher % of T in their blood as proof that T and skin pigmentation are correlated is almost as retarded as you.

&gt;You're completely deluded. I can say genetics have no impact on height since you can be short with poor nutrition

false equivalence. Btw race has almost zero impact on testostorone. 

&gt;With or without adjustment for covariates, there were no significant differences in testosterone, bioavailable testosterone, or SHBG levels by race/ethnicity.¬†

The meeting was attended by the Ministers of State H.S.Puri and Som Parkash, Secretaries of the Department of Commerce, and Pharmaceuticals, and Officers from Departments of Commerce, Pharmaceuticals and Health.
During his interaction, Goyal lauded the pharma industry for making India proud, by rising to the occasion during the Covid crisis.¬†
He said that India has been recognized as the ‚ÄòPharmacy of the World‚Äô, as over 120 countries got some essential medicines, during the last two months, including 40 of them getting them in the form of grant, free of cost.¬†
He said that during the crisis, the officials of DGFT, MEA, Health and DoP burnt midnight oil to ensure that the export consignments are delivered at the earliest.¬†
The whole world appreciated India‚Äôs gesture, and this has swelled India‚Äôs goodwill and reputation.¬†
He said that India had adequate production capacity and abundant stock of HCQ and PCM for its projected domestic requirements, and putting restrictions on their exports was to ensure that the medicines are made available to all the needy nations, and no unscrupulous element stocks them for unwarranted gains.
The Pharma industry received accolades from the Minister for their extra-ordinary performance, in ensuring that the Country did not face any type of shortage of medicines during this period. ¬†
Goyal said that early announcement of the Lockdown helped the country in preventing and containing the scourge of pandemic, and also scaling up the health infrastructure and build capacity, besides generating awareness among the people about the precautions and preventive measures.¬†
He said that India has set an example, under the able guidance and leadership of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in being pro-active in management of Covid-19, and also following it up with welfare and relief packages for mitigating its consequences.
Goyal assured the industry that the Government will fully support the industry in its expansion, diversification and strengthening.¬†
He said that the industry has an important role to play in the Aatamnirbhar Bharat campaign. The country should become Aatmanirbhar in APIs as early as possible, as the government has taken a number of steps in this regard.¬†
It has already approved the scheme on Promotion of Bulk Drug Parks for financing Common Infrastructure Facilities in 3 Bulk Drug Parks.¬†
Also, Production Linked Incentive Scheme for promotion of domestic manufacturing of critical KSMs/Drug Intermediates and APIs in the country has been given a go ahead.
The Minister said that anti-dumping investigation process has been expedited. The Minister said that in case of ongoing bilateral FTAs, if any roadblock or unfair competition is being noticed, the Government may be informed and prompt remedial action will be taken. He said they should look at large untapped market in Eastern Europe and Russia.¬†
Calling upon a collaborative route in the R&amp;D efforts, Goyal said the Academicians, Universities, ICMR and private sector should join hands.¬†
Informing the gathering that the Government has decided to disinvest in certain Pharma PSUs, the Minister invited the Indian companies to use PSUs for plug and play model of manufacturing.¬†
The Minister assured the industry that all suggestions presented in the meeting will be quickly examined and wherever required, the inter-ministerial consultations will be completed at the earliest.

Let's analyse Japan: 

bare bones history: they were always isolated from the world and didn't take immigrants. No immigration means no culture mixing, no culture mixing means no slave trade with Europe in medieval times. The Japanese were so fascinated with the first black man to step on the island that they though his skin was purely tattoed (look up the Black Samurai, it's really cool if maybe a bit fictional). They opened up after the US invasion and, well... Bombing. So their culture has had about 70 years to get accustomed to black people not just existing somewhere in the vast world, but actually living in their country.

Then we must remember, they were Americanised, and racism stopped being funny to Americans in the 60s, so the Japanese had around 20 years of American media portraying blackface and stereotypes as their practically only contact with African Americans. We go all the way to the 80s and the first rise of anime, and we fist see real interest in immigration to Japan. So without being too exaggerated, it's only been 40 years since Japan has needed to socially accept black people.

It's a bizarre world. And it's not a pretty story.

1. The first one is from genealogical perspective. I think the correct term would be Astronesian. A more crude definition is the brown people in Nusantara. I believe this concept was popularised by the early European. 
2. Second one is from nationalist perspective. This is defined as those who practice Malay culture and Muslim. This is a shitty definition because the term Malay here is recursive. Most people would attribute Malay culture here as in Johore Malay culture aka Srivijayan culture. People tends to forget Langkasukan or the old Malay culture which originates from north part of peninsular. This eventually leads to common phrase MalAy CaMe FroM InDoNesia (which is partly true).

When people said Philippines are Malay they are referring to term 1.

Same goes to Orang Asli are Malay. What they meant is both Malay and orang Asli are from Astronesian root. (This is not completely correct though because Negritos are not considered as Astronesian).

Here is my shitty analogy. 

Imagine Malaysia as a country, break apart. Sabah and Sarawak become independent. For a few hundred years, people in each state intermarry and create a mixed culture. Dominant language overpower less popular sub-ethic language. Later on, Sabah and Sarawak decided to join Brunei and Kalimantan to form a new country, Bornesia.

They create a new language called Borney which a mix of English (because it's the world standard), Malay (because some of them were parts of Malaysia) , Chinese and local words. 

After another few hundred years..

a) Some will claim that Bornesian came from Peninsular, because Borney sounds like Malay and they eat nasi lemak just like Peninsular people.

He was happy with it, and off he went... only to come back about two hours later as the power supply didn't fit. He seemed legit as he didn't want a refund and wanted to keep the console.

This is copied from a previous comment I've written:

A few countries I like to visit frequently though:

* Portugal: A really wonderful country with good beaches and nature. Highly developed yet affordable. It gets a bit frustrating to stay in after a while so I keep my trips to only a few months.

* Georgia: Very affordable, good government, efficient businesses. Can be a bit frustrating to work with Georgian people due to the culture difference (Georgians are not known for being hard workers). I actually prefer working with Armenians; on occasion I work with a law firm in Armenia and have an assistant in Georgia. I don't like spending too much time in Georgia since culturally it's not the best fit for me, but a few weeks a year to do business works well.

* Turkey: Wonderful culture, terrible government. The internet is awful so it's not a good place to do work. I keep trips to only a few days as a result.

* Mexico: Amazing food. Possibly some of the best food in the world. This is reason enough to stay long term in Mexico. It's not without its faults, but I can stay long periods (e.g. 6 months) of time in Mexico and still enjoy it.

* Serbia: This is one of my favorite countries. I'm not sure if I can exactly pinpoint why I like it so much. Maybe it's I just fit in culturally with the people.

How to turn Vampires Human Again:

&amp;#x200B;

**The Graft:**

Some Verbena have a process called ""the Graft"" to reverse undeath for a full turn of the seasons. This spell rebinds the undead back into the flow of life and the bright side of the goddess. It is a fickle spell, though, and sensitivity of the witch greatly affects how long the graft lasts before the hunger arises and darkness reasserts itself.  In order to graft a vampire, the mage needs to bind a living ""root"" for the creature, a second pattern to serve as host and channel to the flow of life. In the few successful attempts either an particularly large and ancient tree or a willing human volunteer were used as a tap through which the vampires pattern could drink from the natural cycle of life.  As long as the spell lasts, the root organism has its force and vitality shared with the vampire. It craves for a large amound food and sleep and his health is more fragile for sustaining his partner. During spring, the root suffers very little, but as seasons progress, passing summer and autum, the drain becomes severe and by the first snowfall, the connection tends to be abruptly severed with risk of death if it for some reason lingers.  During the whole proccess, though, the vampire is restored to a perfect human state. It's health dwindles a little during the year, though. In the dark nights of winter, though, the curse reasserts itself with unmatched intesity, the beasts craving to take the blood it was dennied during the rest of the year feels the thirst of the goddess herself reaping the world if cold and darkness.  Old tales instruct witches to lock down the undead in thse periods, starving them into torpor under the roots of their trees or the house of their hosts until spring provides not only the blood but also strenght for a new root to be reatached.

A master in life with the right amount of study and reasearch is able to properly graft a vampire for a whole year, but desperate or daring disciples and initiates have been able to accomplish weaker versions of the rite hat last for a lunar month or even a single day. One thing in common in all version of the rite, though, is that a lingering bound is created between root and graft, and if one is hurt before the other is surely to feel the waves. In a particularly terrible account of this spell, the reborn graft was killed in an accident and the root later on inherited the curse of caine as soon as the moon shone later that year in the first winter night.

&amp;#x200B;

**Baptism of  Flames**

A saint of the chorus  is attributed to have performed this miracle in medieval europe. To rebaptize a pious cainite who truly craved redemption.  A dangerous rite and a proof of faith, this cerimony must be is performed at the cusp of dawn. The cainite must bath in the sacred waters of a holy place, and allow the heavenly nectar inside his body through the transmogrification of the blood of christ in the substance of holy wine. If the cainite can fully face the sun with the wine firmly kept in his gut, the flames that erupt from his skin will be soothed just enough the curse of caine will be consumed but his raw black flesh will slowly heal as a mortal in the months and years that follow.

Hermetics that witnessed the rite theorize that a prodigial amount of vis is being suffused in the pattern of the vampire, reinforcing and protecting whatever is left of the mortal fiber while the mystical underpinnings of the curse are allowed to burst in full exposure to the solar emanation.

**Transmigration of the Soul**

A modern thanatoic solution to the unbalance state of undeath. The transmigration of the soul allow a vampire spirit to be severed from his undead form and replaced in the body of a mortal. Although simple in design, this arbitration leaves a lot of very difficult karmic strands to be unknotted by the former vampire.  The curse of undeath is manifested in the cravings and hungers of the beast and the more a soul ressonates with those base desires, the stronger the chains that binds it to them. The transmigration is a second chance at life, the first step in a long journey of attoning for the debts and vices that chain man and beast. Only when the newly reincarnated individual has surpassed his previous flaws and repaid the debt of blood and violence, he is truly and finally freed from his connection.

During the transmigration, two being exist. A savage mindless monster that stalks the night and carries fleeting memories of his previous existence and a indebted soul that walks the living world in a borrowed mortal body.  Fate binds these two creatures as their paths will cross over and over again until the former vampire pay all his debts and grows into a more enlightened individual. To destroy the undead monster only frees the immaterial beast to try to merge with the transmigrated soul once again, and the borrowed body must come from a being that genuinely lost its grip on life and its will to live.

&amp;#x200B;

**Experimental Hemoetherical Transfusional Dialysis**

This whole design is based on the observation that the vampiric condition seems tied to a proccess in which antropossential animal aether is removed from the afflicted and is substituted through a infusion of mutagenic hemophagic essence.  The EHTD is vicious theoretical machine that extracts residual antropossential aether from the vampire sire (vector) and reconstitutes a near human-serum that can be injected as a supplement for the vampire child. A few minutes after the supplement is injected, most of the symptoms of vampirisms subsumes becoming more manageable mild version of allergies, irritability and photosensibility.

the injections are produced at great cost for the donor, though, as it is a excruciating and   exhausting process that, in time, end up aggravating his own vampiric affliction. The higher the serum concentration, the longer the effects last but the more it drains the sire. which leads to depletion and weakening of subsequent extractions.

While the current treatment is not definitive, further research seems to point that a complete rescontitutive serum can be achieved by making incremental compounds using older vampires of a given lineage . Thus, a theoretical fully humanizing extract can be developed for an individual after collecting and reconstituting the human essences of three to four generations of previous vectors. At this time, the further a Scientist has come from testing this hypothesis is to use extracted samples of older vampires to refine a intermediate serum to strenghten and recover the vivacity of a deepleted vampiric donor.",True,False,False,,,0,1591039621,,1591040686,0,{},fsk1o86,False,t3_gunp45,False,False,t3_gunp45,/r/WhiteWolfRPG/comments/gunp45/become_human_again/fsk1o86/,False,,1596968359,10,True,False,WhiteWolfRPG,t5_2u6fa,r/WhiteWolfRPG,public,,0,[],

Nothing you've posted indicates the media orgs were being mislabeled due to a particular narrative.

&gt;it is, in fact, a slippery slope.

Again, logical fallacy. I'm not sure why you keep admitting your argument is baseless without the assumption that it will lead to greater levels of restriction. Since this is the only example and it was resolved in 2018, that suggests the ""slippery slope"" never occurred.

&gt;You also point out that there were probably media that had the same narrative, but that they were not labeled. That is incorrect.

Doesnt matter if research studies are included. The validity of it means nothing. I'm instantly racist. Rather than have open conversations about issues that no one wants to even contemplate are possible, these subjects just get tossed to the side.

I can't imagine why. 


&gt;I'm not sure I support the lack of nutrition hypothesis. It goes against some other thoughts I have.

&gt;Humans aren't immune from evolution within the species. Blacks adapted to hotter temperatures by producing increased melanin in their skin to prevent sunburn. Asians developed slanted eyes because they adapted to more direct sunlight at higher altitudes.

&gt;Certain African cultures cannot see certain colors because they dont have words for them. Blue is a big one. To them, the sky is black. That's how they actually see the sky, too. However, they have multiple words for green and can see hues of green traditional Europeans cannot see.

&gt;So what does this all mean? Well, why is IQ off the table for evolutionary purposes? 

I simply cannot fathom why nobody is giving you the benefit of the doubt, here. 

^(Also, no, that's not how human biology works, lol.)



&gt;He's not saying its their fault. He's saying it's their responsibility.

&gt;The Jews were largely put at fault because the Germans couldn't rely on any financial institutions to turn their economy around. You forget that the Allies have as much blame as Hitler in starting WWII. The Allies fucked over the German's economy, forced them to pay for ALL of WWI, and global financial institutions chiefly controlled by Jews refused to give Germany a loan. Turns out the holocaust was completely avoidable.

&gt;You also forget that neither the north or south gave a shit about slave rights. By the end of the civil war, there were more slaves than non slaves. The north feared a government overthrow and they didnt have the resources to support the slaves. To make matters worse, the slaves were too uneducated to work in the north's predominant manufacturing industries.

&gt;It was never about the rights of slaves. It was about the economy.

&gt;And yes, as fucked up as these situations were, if the demographic of choice proved their value to the aggressors, this shit never would have happened.

I'm quite excited by your suggestions on a personal level, they fit quite perfectly with my views.

I would suggest that, for the sake of making it better for everyone, both countries could adopt ""Euro-English"" as their primary language with German and French still official as well; and have all three be taught since pre-school. 

Luxembourg does that (with Luxembourgish + DE + FR, but also with English) before 10 years old, and it works *wonders*, they are polyglots by excellence).

The reason I'm bringing Euroenglish into the mix is that, if you're gonna teach a second language early on, it might as well be ""the best"" overall, in this case both internationally and as far as other members of a European Federation would fit too. And I particularly like the idea that it would forge a ""new"" culture so to speak at the same time both for Germans and the French, that's binding generations together (youth having shared the same experience).

&gt; TV like ARTE

Yes, please, where do I sign. I want that yesterday :(

I've long admired the BBC for the historical quality of its programs (e.g. documentaries featuring, in writing, actual PhDs breaking new grounds: how refreshing compared to most basic ""TV"" production). And ARTE is truly a worthy comparison to make, it sits up there with the giants. I think such cultural cornerstones are, in retrospect, instrumental in building both intelligent and lasting cultures. They need to adapt to the times and push to TikTok all the way back from TV, though, passing by the Tubes and whatnot. *If your 15 years old doesn't know it, it doesn't exist as far as the future is concerned (haha, j/k, but you get the idea).*

Agreed on constitutional difficulties in finding a good enough common regime at a Federal level; it is in my opinion the biggest cultural gap between France and Germany: the political culture of institutions. The gist of it is a centralized versus federalized culture, and you might well be looking at two of the most dramatically opposed countries on that spectrum within the EU. I mean, there's Switzerland beyond Germany; and maybe small states are more centralized than France... but at that scale?

I very much fear the clash of cultures, and I'm hard at work trying to research/think political systems that allow both mechanisms (extreme forms of decentralization, extreme forms of concentration) to coexist and even feed each other nicely, synergistically.

In what other manner of freedoms? Like to bear arms? How about to elect every single member of our representative body? There are no monarchies here. As for happiness - that's entirely subjective. I would not be happy in Norway. The culture is too different and Europeans tend to be a bit stuck up apart from the Brits (if you subscribe to the idea they're European...I'm not even sure if they all agree on that point).
2. Why would we need to? There's nothing to be gained with Norway. Further evidence of how meh your nation is, geopolitically speaking.
3. I don't either. I have a job and insurance. I do agree changes need to be made in our healthcare, but the simple fact is that not all Americans are in the ""bankruptcy"" bubble of insurance. Many of us are not because we have careers with well paying and well benefitted job. Not to say we cannot improve the situation for those who are not so fortunate. And as far as safety: you can be stabbed. You can be beaten. Yes we have gangs and violence.
4. Of the top 10 pharmaceutical companies the US itself has 4 and it has the #1 and the #4 by revenue.

Hitler (like many like him elsewhere) was a populist demagogue who tapped into the racism already rampant in German society at the time. And that was far from only prevalent in Germany - see the pogroms all over eastern Europe that triggered large immigration waves of Jews to America in the late 19th &amp; early 20th century. 

I remember talking in Berlin to a German Jew who lived in western Germany in the 70s and he was saying how it was totally normal to hear ""mild"" anti-Semitic comments all the time when he was a kid at school &amp; that it's much rarer today. His teacher apparently put him as an example in-front of the class to show the other pupils some thing about ""typical Jewish traits"". When I myself was a student at the TU Wien in the early 00s I remember an older professor talking about ""how Muslims are"" (there were students with headscarves in the class looking very uncomfortable as he said that) - this was already walking on thin ice back then but I'm pretty sure it would get him into deeper shit today.

Look at how Sinti and Roma are treated (and have been treated) all over Europe. Ask any German of Turkish decent whose parents came to Germany or Austria as Gastarbeiter in the 60s or 70s what it was like at the time to be Turkish in these countries. Ask any Black person who has been here for a long time what it was like to be Black in western Germany 10-20-30 years ago compared to now (not that it's great now). Heck Milo≈°eviƒá was in power in the 90s, so during the time the photographed people's parents' were roughly their age today - and that wasn't in Germany.

If you are ""white"" it is easy to think there was no or not much racism but it is much more likely that it was simply invisible to you as you were not the target. And also naturally when there were fewer visible immigrants racism was less of a media topic, doesn't mean they didn't experience it - rather that you didn't hear of it.

And more to your point - why mention they are white? Because the current protests are against police brutality against Black people (one of many manifestations of the common problem of white on black racism - more pressing in America for historical and demographic reasons but it's not a purely American problem).

&gt;I think that this question of our identity is the Canadian Identity

I believe you are correct in this statement, but that is where I believe perhaps the identity problems arise in Canada. We are stuck in this paradox like situation of both possessing and not possessing a sense of identity. 

&gt; we measure to the low bar of the US and pretend like we're different even though we're very similar. 

Hit the nail on the head there. We have some sort of superiority complex with regards to the States. It seems as though we see how the world reacts to the States, and then we make reactionary moves for better optics, but simultaneously ignoring things within our own society that need to be addressed. That is why I am frustrated with the protests right now. It took and American death from American hands for Canadians to march in the streets, but meanwhile Canadian indigenous get racially profiled and have police brutality conducted against them and we ignore it, which you pointed out.

&gt;  similar policing issues, weather that's indegenous or people of colour being targeted or the fact that the police are somewhat of an occupying force. 

I have been to The Northwest Territories and it is bad. Every RCMP car that passed got flipped off by the indigenous kids I was with. Canadians are happy to be activists for American problems because it is popular online, but ignore real issues that need to be addressed in this country.  

&gt;  ""I like to say we're like siblings with the US, but we're the younger more chill one that the parents tried hard to not screw up after the older brother got edgy and revolted. ""  
&gt;  
&gt;"" Our identity now is still routed in European traditions, but the cultural gravity of the US also pulls us in. We are aware of that and try to distinguish ourselves as not American and this is where I think we stand out.  ""

This is where I disagree, because I don't believe that this can be a national identity (if that is what you were trying to say). I'd argue that if we are reliant on another nation with a more well defined identity to form our own identity, then we do not have one of our own. If we do have one based on that, it is not very a strong identity. I love my country of Canada, but I always struggle with what it means to be Canadian. ""Politeness, acceptance, tolerance"" are well and good, but that is how people ought to act anyway.

By Islam women should dress like that, and she dresses like that. I'm saying that people of Balkan have tribe like nature, so do Muslims who come from different countries. Very tight familial relationships, I don't live on Balkan anymore, I live in western Europe, I hang out with Muslim immigrant population, and they all have strong familial relationship, like I do, they feel like they belong in that group, and that is hard to change. In west you are taught to be an individual, so you behave like a one, but in the east we form clans, groups, and we are connected. Being rejected by that group falls hard on people. That's my point. Are you claiming that Muslim families don't have strong relationship and don't stick with their own in UK?

What a poor response. I am simply restating what they said they are going to do. That the protests and often rioting is going to go through Europe. That is what they said. They said it about UK before the protests happened.

Policing in the U.S. is very local. Most states don‚Äôt have a state police force, and if they do, they only handle select issues. There are no national police, and no organization at the national level. 

You asked who they answer to, and that depends. In nearly all cases, they answer to local elected officials ‚Äî mayors, district attorneys, police commissioners, or sheriffs (yes, elected). In most cases their immediate leaders are career professionals, but they are sometimes politicians, as is the case with sheriffs. 

So how police act, are regulated, trained, disciplined, and handle situations varies a lot from town to town, county to county, and state to state. It‚Äôs all about the local recruiting, training, professionalism, leadership, and culture. It‚Äôs why you see some police in areas participating in the protests, and in others, actively agitating them. 

Not all American police are monsters, or even bad people. Some, in some places, are terrible, and that‚Äôs often a result of the local situation there. 

American police do have more authority than their European counterparts in most cases (though not always, French police seem to be able to detain anyone who looks at them...), and are faster to use force.

The part that intrigues me is that the early nudist culture in America was not THAT different than that of Europe, but for whatever reason, the family naturist thing took root in Europe where the puritan values of the US seemed to kill those ideals dead as we made our way into the swinging sixties.

I also find it interesting that the first place most Americans think of when they think of naked in Europe is Cap d'Adge, France, which to most French people is the antithesis of family naturism and more like closely aligned with those trendy nudist US destinations that cater to adults. But as it happens, there are well over 200 ""naturist campings"" in France alone, and we have yet to visit one that doesn't have a fairly even demographic ranging from young families to pensioners. Some of them even belong to a consortium of naturist venues so they can share the expense of producing a simple website and marketing materials, but in the last place, those materials are more appealing than ANYthing produced by 80% of nudist places in the US. For that matter, you can put up a website on a wordpress blog with a built in theme and formatting, good to go, for less that $100 a year. In 2020, any prospective naturist is going to make the web search the first stop for any potential outing, ESPECIALLY if they're simply trying to figure out what family oriented nudism is all about. 

As to demand, I spend a lot of time with college-aged kids, and I think we're entering a time where a new audience could be won over pretty easily if they could figure the whole thing out and it was affordable to participate. Just as it has been in the past, we have a generation of young humans who are fed up with societal norms, and would likely get naked if there were a few more places for people in their demographic where it's comfortable to do so. This COULD be the golden moment, but if a 25 year-old lands on the antiquated page about Saturday's lingerie dance and covered dish dinner, it's gonna be a non-starter.

Just because there are Jews indigenous to Palestine, doesn't mean European Jews can invade Palestine by association. That's such a pathetically weak argument. You also seem to forget that Judaism was a religion before jt became an ethno-religion, so most Jews would've converted to Christiniaty and then Islam 1-2 thousand years ago.

-US people: ""haha, they are so funny using umbrellas and building road blockades, let's make memes about them... What are you saying? .... Nooo, we have guns, this can't happen to us. *

*Riot happens in the US because of the same reason*
-US people: ""THIS IS SERIOUS, YOU SHOULDN'T JOKE ABOUT THINGS LIKE THIS, PEOPLE DIED!!!""

And the irony is the recovery of those ex-mining areas was part funded by the EU, you cant throw a stone in the village I grew up with without hitting one of those blue 'funded by the EU' plaques.

It is about harmony of the laws which stemmed from the same/similar ethics shaped by religion in olden times. The other person might be an atheist or not. It is easier if they had contact with christian relatives.

And ethnicity doesn't play big role here. Europeans go along relatively well with people from latin america, Russia (ethnically diverse) and far east (as in: far eastern religions leave a room for dialogue with everyone).

Britain and germany - they speak in different tounges, but the laws and customs are similar, becouse they had common roots as far as culture goes.

&gt; Oi Polloi's first studio recording was a demo entitled Destroi the System, which is believed to have been released in 1984 or 1985. After the now defunct music weekly Sounds gave their previous home-recorded demo a favourable review, demand increased for gigs further afield. A second studio demo, Green Anarchoi followed before the release of the first vinyl offering, Resist the Atomic Menace. The line-up of the group has starred an impressive fifty members since their formation, making up the countless incarnations of the band. The band is currently based in Scotland.

&gt; 
Attacking world leaders and multi-national companies with humour and anger in different languages The band holds a political view which some call ultra-hardline ecologism, with the motto ""No compromise in defence of our earth"". They support direct action in defence of the environment, and endorse resistance against racialism, fascism and imperialism. They are considered by many to be one of the premier faces of anarcho-punk. They have recently started singing in Scottish Gaelic and use the language in day to day communications. They see the use of Gaelic and other endangered languages as important to maintaining the biocultural diversity of life. They recently toured Europe with Seattle-based punk band Mill a h-Uile Rud who sing entirely in Scots Gaelic. Singer Derek has recently become involved in Gaelic television and has appeared as Moses on a Gaelic comedy programme. Despite what some believe, the band did not start out as a ""skinhead band"" but was in fact formed by a bunch of teenage schoolkids (with a long haired lead singer who had a fear of skinheads!!) who played their first gig at Stewarts Melville College in Edinburgh in late 1981. After numerous other gigs in the Edinburgh area and the recording of the group's first cassette demo ""Last of the Mohicans"" on a home hi-fi, drummer Stu ""Doccy"" Dunn left to become a karate instructor and was replaced by Muz who later recorded with the Apostles. Apostles and Political Asylum original drummer Chris Low also did a stint on the kit for a time while various other one time Oi Polloi members went on to play in such varied bands as Disorder, Exploited, Gin Goblins, Newtown Grunts, Moniack and In Decades Decline. Drummer Murray Briggs who played on several of the band's 7"" records as well as the ""Fuaim Catha"" LP now plays in Scottish Indie band Aberfeldy along with brother Riley who himself had a brief spell as Oi Polloi guitarist back in the '90s. David 'Rat' Connolly was the guitarist through much of the early years, playing his last gig and album in 1991. Rat wrote the music for classic songs such as Pigs for Slaughter and Boot down the Door, he went on to become an Archaeologist and Middle Eastern adventurer.

&gt; The name Oi Polloi is a greeklish(Greek with Latin characters) spelled noun (Greek : ŒüŒπ œÄŒøŒªŒªŒøŒØ). It's literal meaning is ""the many"", however it is extended to mean ""the masses"" or ""the common people"". Oi! also refers to a form of punk music.  Their last LP - Ar C√†nan, Ar Ceol, Ar-a-Mach - was recorded entirley in Scottish Gaelic. Read more on Last.fm.

About what your relative told you about being french, the basque country is formed by 2 sides: the spanish side and the french side. The spanish side is in the north of the iberian peninsula and the french side is on the southwestern part of france. Depending on the family your relative grew up in, they might have considered themselves as french as being basque is not an oficial nationality nowadays (and hasn't been since quite a long time ago). Nowadays being basque is a, let's say  a ""pride""  thing because officially you are either spanish or french. 

Us, basque people have a very long tratiditon and one of the hardest to learn and most antique language in the world, because it doesn't share any other similarities with the rest of european languages. If you want to check some more information about it, look for basque or euskera on the internet.

Another thing that I find very interesting is that our traditional culture is based in nature and all of our mithology is also related to that.

The dangers are concrete, providing people with power to abuse has lead to abuse of power.  Look at China's long list of human rights abuses, including illegal organ harvesting.  For a more democratic example, look at Eastern/Southern Europe and the US pharmaceutical industry.

Hamilton is more talented than Prost, if by talent we should mean a constellation of a few essential things, foremost among them being inherent speed and car-control.

Also, if you are willing, could you point me in the direction of sources and data on international distribution efforts (particularly where different groups source their vaccines from), and European production and distribution in English?  Detailed information from other countries would also be fine though.

&gt;That isn't an inherent problem of  vaccines tho. A sufficiently corrupt country could price gouge whatever  they want. They could price-gouge education, healthcare, insurance,  property, labor, food, entertainment, etc.  
&gt;  
&gt;Heck,  of all the things a ""Sufficiently corrupt country"" could meddle with to  do evil, vaccines are on the bottom of the list. The inherent  complexity, low impact and high visibility of such an act would make  them a very poor choice.

Excellent point.  

&gt;Also probably grounds for intervention by the UN, and several international bodies.

Plenty of corrupt countries do get away with things like mass organ harvesting, large scale drug distribution, and political violence and censorship, with little more than a slap on the wrist.  The UN, while useful as a vent and a platform, is pretty toothless anywhere where a sufficiently strong government's interests lie or don't lie.

&gt;A similar situation has happened already btw. Look up the baby formula  problem with china. Even Chinese people no longer buy baby formula from  China. If you ever see someone buy a ton of baby formula in your store  it's to import to china.

I don't know about this argument.  If effects are limited and difficult to pass off as intentional, people have also historically ended up just shrugging their shoulders.

That leaves one more point that bothers me, and that is the practice of mandating vaccines being used as a precedent to mandate other, more invasive things.  I'm all for public education campaigns.

[],,urUnPopularBoomer,,,,[],,,,text,t2_5xmzbvyh,False,False,[],"This has got to be one of the most stupid thing done by Americans. These are my reasons:

1. These riots are happening in places totally UNRELATED to the initial wrongdoing, involving people who are not related to this wrongdoing. I know I‚Äôm only arguing beliefs and ethical standpoints but this is what I believe in. I live in the Bay Area (East Bay) so I might not be the most informed upon their objective but what I‚Äôm saying is what I believe and I am not saying the reason is a bad reason but what they‚Äôre doing is going way beyond their initial objective. These riots started in Minneapolis where the initial wrongdoing happened but now has spread to Europe, which has absolutely NOTHING to do with this. 

2. This is terrorism. No matter how much they say, ‚Äúit‚Äôs not okay! The police killed George Floyd! An innocent BLACK man!‚Äù they are crossing the thin line between terrorism and protest. Burning down, crushing down,  and looting small businesses that they, a while back, had been supporting saying ‚Äúsmall businesses matter!‚Äù (Yeah. ‚ÄúSmall businesses matter‚Äù my ass). It all makes no difference. They are using George Floyd, an innocent man who‚Äôd probably never have wanted this to happen, and his death as an excuse to commit worse crimes. And no matter what, from my ethical standpoint, I think this is a worse moral statement than killing an innocent black person because of a longstanding prejudice against black people. And what‚Äôs worse is that they can cover it up and do their own thing because they don‚Äôt care. I know that people who do things like this have nothing to lose. They might not have money, a house, a family, or something that means a lot to them. That‚Äôs why those people do it. Because they have nothing to lose. And if they‚Äôre going to die doing it, why not make an ‚Äòimpact‚Äô before they die whether it be good or bad? They don‚Äôt care about themselves, others, and it might just be survival. 

3. We all know this was a mistake on the police officer but they don‚Äôt need to burn down small businesses. Because THEY aren‚Äôt going to pay for the damaged property. The small businesses, that have done nothing wrong, THEY have to pay the price. The people who burn down, ravage, and loot other homes, stores, and buildings are just. So. Selfish. They don‚Äôt care about others, they block up roads, emit so many toxins into the atmosphere by setting fires to house after house, store after store, building after building, don‚Äôt even deserve jail. Because OUR tax money goes into maintaining the jails. They don‚Äôt deserve pity, they don‚Äôt deserve any of it. Because they took everything from some families, who owned a small shop and were living their lives barely afloat, slowly drowning from this pandemic. They took that small, well meaning family‚Äôs only hope of survival. They burnt down their little restaurant. For little to no reason. 

I‚Äôm sorry if you don‚Äôt agree with everything I said, but one, this is a place for unpopular opinions, two, I‚Äôm saying all of this from a personal moral/ethical standpoint, and three, I‚Äôm really annoyed. I know that the last one makes little sense, but I know my area has a little chance of being overrun by rioters. I also know that the area a little down the hill has a larger chance of this happening. I understand that I‚Äôm one of the lucky percentage that didn‚Äôt get very affected by this pandemic and that others have it way worse than I do. But I‚Äôm just saying, i don‚Äôt want my classmates to get caught in their riot. I don‚Äôt want it to affect the people I know. The dialysis center where my mom works has a pretty large mall next to it. And that mall was just affected. Who knows, they might target the dialysis center. Then they will be responsible for so many more damages. The loss of my mother‚Äôs job, the loss of my mother‚Äôs coworkers jobs, so many dialysis patients who got their blood cleaned three times a week. If they think that all of that is worth proving their point, I don‚Äôt want to see them. Because I know I‚Äôll completely lose it.

There's no explicit deadline on when it needs to be done, but we still need to finish casting the parts, a cast reading, recording, editing, then finally it goes live on the Patreon in December, with a clip released on the main feed around the same time.

As for the bulk of the show... it's an ""urban fantasy-horror actual play rpg"". Meaning that I run a tabletop game I designed while my friend Brannigan plays it and explores the world in the context of a perpetually evolving narrative. The game is set in a world where magic has historically always existed, so events like the pilgrims landing at Plymouth Rock went *wildly different*. Most of Europe is divided up between an occult-friendly proto-Germanic kingdom and a czarist police state Russia.  What would be the US and Canada is instead the United States of Kanata. And because the Spanish conquistadors were murdered on sight, Mezico has risen as a powerhouse nation with a real hatred for outsiders.

The show so far primarily follows Alex Oberlin, a troubled young adult constantly questioning their sense of self while facing down notably deadly opponents.

(Human) Colonialism is not a modern phenomena and predates factories.

I'll repeat that your idea is very narrow, modern, wrong and your use of 'nature' in conjunction reads well with human exceptionalism.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Colonialism is not a modern phenomenon. World history is full of examples of one society gradually expanding by incorporating adjacent territory and settling its people on newly conquered territory. The ancient Greeks set up colonies as did the Romans, the Moors, and the Ottomans, to name just a few of the most famous examples. Colonialism, then, is not restricted to a specific time or place. Nevertheless, in the sixteenth century, colonialism changed decisively because of technological developments in navigation that began to connect more remote parts of the world. Fast sailing ships made it possible to reach distant ports and to sustain close ties between the center and colonies. Thus, the modern European colonial project emerged when it became possible to move large numbers of people across the ocean and to maintain political sovereignty in spite of geographical dispersion. This entry uses the term colonialism to describe the process of European settlement and political control over the rest of the world, including the Americas, Australia, and parts of Africa and Asia.

Over time this evolved in the plantation owners creating a system of propagating a sense of white supremacy in order to defend their action to themselves and to convince all the poor non-slaves to not get along with the blacks so they wouldn't work together and wrestle back control of the region from the plantation owners who had something of a despotic control of the area.",True,False,False,,,0,1591072676,,False,0,{},fslqefu,False,t3_gus3sg,False,True,t1_fslo9qs,/r/conspiracy/comments/gus3sg/this_is_a_pretty_big_conspiracy/fslqefu/,False,,1597000697,1,True,False,conspiracy,t5_2qh4r,r/conspiracy,public,,0,[],

For example, the plebeian-patrician conflict, was not a working class-upper class struggle as it is often portrayed, it is actually, a conflict between a class of urban capitalists, and agrarian aristocrats, respectively, and in the end, that upper class infighting ended up giving better and sometimes even nominally equal rights to proletarians and foreigners in Rome. 

Another case is how the unification of laws and the birth of academic common law reduced the almost unlimited privileges of feudal nobility, benefiting religious and ethnic minorities, as well as urban and rural commoners along with it. Despite the process being a long and complicated conflict of interests across Christian Europe, that involved the peasantry and urban poor revolting in some occasions, it was far more centered upon the centralist interests of monarchs, the church‚Äôs strive for influence and relevance and nobilities‚Äô defense of their privilege. 

The Reform was also a process that ended reducing the churches sway over European politics and daily life, doing away with an important amount of corruption and abuse along the way. It started as an internal, ecclesiastical divide and then to an all out schism that did indeed involve the poor, yet could not have solidified without the aid of north European princes looking out for their own interests.

These two processes led to the rise of absolutism, which created the modern nation-states, and then gave way to illustration and liberalism, as the conflict erupted between tradition and power in one side and reason and liberty on the other. This culminated on the end of several oppressive forms of government at its best and the granting of important civil rights at its worst, but let‚Äôs not forget this was again a conflict fought by the people‚Äôs and led by elites, the old aristocracy against the intellectuals and entrepreneurs.

There‚Äôs a lot to miss when simply interpreting history as a permanent class struggle, when in reality is a process that, in a way, runs on multiple, interconnected avenues. Sure, relations between the privileged and the disenfranchised exist, but interpreting everything else just as mere superstructure is foolish and blind. The progress of individual rights and liberties cannot be simply attributed to conquests of the oppressed. It is much more. History is a tale of several clashing interests, groups, leaders and ideas that lead to the world of today, just looking at it on a pure, bidimensional axis is denying oneself of the true scope of mankind‚Äôs mark upon existence.

Cotton was less available due to the lack of automation in American cotton processing and military farmers were still growing flax and spinning linen. I work more towards the mid nineteenth century new England but I assume the same holds true for earlier time periods: city America working class is 5-10 years behind European fashions, and rural American working class is at least 10 years behind city American fashions. In fact, French visitors to rural new England in the 1820s and 30s were so struck by the distinct (read: old) clothing that rural new englanders wore that they wrote about it. 

As for colors, choosing a region and working with colors that exist within the natural local dyestuffs is always safe. For example, in new England that might include colors derived from onion skins, tansy, black walnut hulls, sage, and other local dyes. Things that are edible are not commonly used as dyes because their colors create a less colorfast stain and prone preferred to eat what they could. That means ""dyes""/stains derived from beets, berries, and cabbages are highly unlikely. 

Paper patterns had not yet been invented so most gowns (the word dress wasnt commonly used until the later 19th century, also used occasionally was the word mantua) were relatively simple patterns that could be replicated and altered by a home sewer. Fancier patterns would be achieved by taking nice cloth to a mantuamaker who would make a pattern based on your measurements and cut the gown out for you, then send the pieces home for you to assemble. Shifts or chemises were typically cut fairly square with a wide neckline and assembled from simple pieces. Morgan Donner has a great video on shift making, and even though hers is medieval shifts really didn't change that much.

Don't pretend like the first amendment only protects white supremacist extremists.

True, all of which are problematic, but who is killing whom?

&gt;So wanting to be able to say things without the government persecuting you is extremist?

Yes, wanting to be able to say anything without limits is extremist.

&gt;That's a major reason so many people, especially from Eastern Europe, China, Africa, and the Middle East immigrate here.

Not really, people move to the US because of a possibility of having better economic opportunities, mostly, or fleeing from persecution, not because their governments don't protect nazi apology.

&gt;it doesn't make you look good supporting suppression of speech (which hurts religious/ethnic/political minorities).

Actually it does, most places in the world disagree with this idea that wanting people dead is fair game as long as you don't act on it. And it doesn't harm minorities to be against hate speech and inciting violence, much on the contrary. The US itself is not exactly known for its fair treatment of minorities.

&gt;Other countries don't have this ""American Dream"" aspect, which is why people don't choose to move there as much as here.

That's factually incorrect. In proportional terms many countries received more immigrants than the US. They simply receive more in absolute terms because they are the largest developed country in absolute size (pop and economy).

&gt;You don't even believe in the marketplace of ideas? I don't even know what to say... You must not believe in debating ideas in order to come to the truth.

It's not that I don't believe in it, it's just that we don't live in a French 19th century Caf√© so pretending ideas float freely and can be logically discussed, discarded and the ""truth"" will come out eventually in the form of a consensus doesn't work in modern societies that have mass media etc. You probably know that, but that's the whole question debated by the School of Frankfurt.

&gt;There is no physical danger of some loser being a Nazi, that's paranoia.

Sure, it's not like they could ever take power, make laws and submit other people to their laws, right? That's ridiculous. It's specially ridiculous when one think of how impossible it would be for an ideology like theirs to influence how people think and institutions are built, and generate biases in that way. It happened once so we can be sure it's impossible to happen again. 

&gt;They should be allowed to speak (and be addressed) to embarrass themselves in front of everyone else, not suppressed to that they fester in the dark.

I don't know whether you live in 1932 or 2015.

&gt;Perjury is a failure to admit the truth and defamation causes demonstrable damage that has to be proven. Both are hard to prove and in practice don't cause significant issues with free speech.

There is damage in nazis proclaiming Nazi ideology, and one could argue reproducing racialist ideology is a lie that causes damage. What do I do then? The truth is you are fine with the amount of restrictions on freedom of speech that are in place in your country and not in others because it's your comfort zone and, maybe, you are also too deep in the whole narrative of American exceptionalism. There is no hard difference between forbidding one to reproduce lies about racial inferiority or forbidding one to lie about someone else, which on the one hand doesn't mean there is *no* difference, but it does mean that the huge amount of noise Americans make about it should be always be put under the microscope because they aren't defending the only (and not even the most) defensible position. 

But well, if by the ""enlightenment"" you meant that the US is a country that believes there is a single knowable universal truth and that one can easily access it if - if only - we discuss hard enough with other unbiased 100% rational individuals who obviously are all also trying to get to the truth in good faith, then maybe in those terms the mainstream US ideology (and self-perception) is the most enlightened of them all, but I don't think so lowly of the philosophers of the enlightenment era to accept that they knew so little about reality and humanity as that, even if some of them were rather more optimistic than history showed they should have been.",True,False,False,,,0,1591075181,,False,0,{},fsltzaw,False,t3_guv2u8,False,True,t1_fsls535,/r/asklatinamerica/comments/guv2u8/why_are_brazilian_musical_artists_posting_antifa/fsltzaw/,False,,1597002675,1,True,False,asklatinamerica,t5_fda8k,r/asklatinamerica,public,,0,[],

Firstly, empirically you're wrong. Black people are more impoverished, more likely to go to jail, more likely to be shot, etc. In the US than in most places in Europe.

That's not why I brought up the protests, it was to show that the UK also protests racism when it happens and that the assertion that media is responsible for it in the US is silly (although I concede they're probably exacerbating it)

Secondly, you're assuming the threshold for action against racism is the same. It's not. The George Floyd situation is far, far, FAR more egregious than the Mark Duggan situation, to the point where people in other developed countries are protesting it outside the US embassy.


To be clear about what I'm trying to say. The guy I was replying to was trying to suggest that Europe is as racist as the US but there's no racism protests there cuz the media isn't antagonising. And I'm saying, no, Europe isn't as racist, but when there is occasional instances of blatant racism (which are less frequent even accounting for populations), then they do also riot.

Actually this is true for any EU country where you have ancestry, thanks to the jus sanguinis path (citizenship through ancestry).   Some countries in Europe especially open to ancestral immigration from the Americas include Italy, Hungary, Germany, the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, Austria and the Baltic nations, among others. My advice would be to talk first with the consulate (ex. the Polish consulate) where you have ancestry--they're doing a lot of remote appts. these days due to COVID-19. Italy for example, will vary some depending on whether you have paternal or maternal ancestry but is quite open. Hungary allows for very distant ancestry to qualify you. For Germany in principle you already have German citizenship, going back even centuries, just so long as the ancestor who came to the US from Germany did not explicitly renounce before the 1st US-born ancestor was born (which very few did, as their kids were already Americans).

The visa through ancestry path is doubly valuable in 2020 due to the issues with the COVID-19 pandemic, and with the surge in skilled Americans looking to move to Europe given recent events. (In Belgium and Sweden where I was working on contract recently, they have been seeing a record leap in Americans inquiring about moving there.) Jus sanguinis is the fastest and most straightforward track.

For immigration with a basis in skills and work, Germany, France, Austria, Benelux and the Nordics are on an intense skilled worker recruitment drive.

Which still make your comment false because it is applied equally. But as you can read in that article, that principle also isn't something decided in a treaty, and Germany are free to challenge it. It's a union of sovereign countries, not a federation, and the countries need to agree unilaterally for legislation to be practically applicable across the union. If Germany hasn't supported the ECB right to issue bonds in law (which should be legislated in EU law though) they can still challenge the other countries in the union about it. 

&gt;Yeah it‚Äôs about wanting to control and dominate southern states because you don‚Äôt like their culture. Germans wanted to add Italians and Spaniards to their sphere but then get pissed that their administration is Italian or Spanish and not rule bound German. 

That's just a ridiculous statement. It makes you sound completely clueless. Also, Germany isn't Northern Europe, it's Central Europe. 

&gt;And, large swaths of European citizens don‚Äôt support further integration and losing more and more national sovereignty to the EU, it‚Äôs not hard to find them they‚Äôre quite loud. 

I also don't want to lose national sovereignty, but that doesn't mean I want to abolish the EU. You are mistaken if you believe opposing a strong central power in the EU which would overrule national sovereignty is the same as a desire to abolish the union entirely. 

&gt;Also calling the EU‚Äôs legislative system a democracy is funny, let me know when MEPs can initiate legislation. 

Not a single EU law can be passed without the approval of the council and parliament, that makes the union democratic by definition.

If you think Nazis are a significant portion of people anywhere on planet earth, then I don't know what to tell you. Nazis are not killing people. 

&gt;Yes, wanting to be able to say anything without limits is extremist.

Well then we agree to disagree. We aren't operating with the same set of values so we aren't going to get anywhere here.

&gt;Not really, people move to the US because of a possibility of having better economic opportunities, mostly, or fleeing from persecution, not because their governments don't protect nazi apology.

You can't just boil down freedom of speech to Nazi apologism, that's disingenuous. I never said freedom of speech was the only reason, but it is a major reason. All you need to do is ask any person from the regions I mentioned that immigrated here. Heck, even people from places like Cuba would agree with that.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Actually it does, most places in the world disagree with this idea that wanting people dead is fair game as long as you don't act on it. And it doesn't harm minorities to be against hate speech and inciting violence, much on the contrary. The US itself is not exactly known for its fair treatment of minorities.

What you are talking about is thought policing, an idea seen in *1984* that is absolutely tyrannical. You can't legislate negative thoughts or sentiments out of existence, and such rules set dangerous precedent. People in many countries are simply complacent in this regard because they think the government won't ever turn against them. Yes, the US doesn't have a good reputation with minorities, and I would know since I am a minority, but I can't think of another country that is better in the handling of minorities. I also never said minorities can  be against hate speech or inciting violence, the latter of which is illegal anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;That's factually incorrect. In proportional terms many countries received more immigrants than the US. They simply receive more in absolute terms because they are the largest developed country in absolute size (pop and economy).

I should have worded what I said differently, what you said is true. My main point was that millions of people have immigrated here for the precise reason that I mentioned, there are plenty of books that are about this or mention this as a strength that America has over other countries. *The Islamist* is one such book.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; doesn't work in modern societies that have mass media etc.

I would say that it does in fact work, because of social media.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Sure, it's not like they could ever take power, make laws and submit other people to their laws, right? That's ridiculous. It's specially ridiculous when one think of how impossible it would be for an ideology like theirs to influence how people think and institutions are built, and generate biases in that way. It happened once so we can be sure it's impossible to happen again.

That assumes a passive America with a preponderance of Nazis seeking to do this. Also, America is becoming less and less white, so I don't see this as realistic at all in the long run.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I don't know whether you live in 1932 or 2015.

It was a new ideology back then, which was ultimately defeated on the battlefield and philosophically. I don't know why you brought up 2015, are you really trying to say that Nazis got Trump elected or some other meme that's been derided to death by this point? As someone who studies and observes the Alt-Right (which, while toxic, aren't really Nazis or a cohesive group) they don't even really like Trump.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;There is damage in nazis proclaiming Nazi ideology, and one could argue reproducing racialist ideology is a lie that causes damage. What do I do then? The truth is you are fine with the amount of restrictions on freedom of speech that are in place in your country and not in others because it's your comfort zone and, maybe, you are also too deep in the whole narrative of American exceptionalism. There is no hard difference between forbidding one to reproduce lies about racial inferiority or forbidding one to lie about someone else, which on the one hand doesn't mean there is *no* difference, but it does mean that the huge amount of noise Americans make about it should be always be put under the microscope because they aren't defending the only (and not even the most) defensible position.

These ""exceptions"" are not censoring any ideas and address material damage to people. Hate speech isn't hurting anyone materially besides possibly the most mentally fragile of people. These weekend warrior Nazis proclaiming their ideology exposes them to the rest of the world and allows for them to be shamed, debated, addressed, etc. I see no damage from letting villains speak, it's not like their ideas are just going to disappear out of human consciousness. Your idea of ""damage from a lie"" is contrived, you couldn't possibly expect racial supremacy to be erased from human thought and discourse. As for American exceptionalism, we certainly are exceptional in certain aspects. From the book that I mentioned:

 ‚ÄúAmerica, in stark contrast to Europe, is a society built on the notion of meritocracy, which offers hope to newcomers in the form of the American Dream, a guarantee of certain rights that, if taken advantage of, can lead to upward mobility within one or two generations. Many young American Muslims feel both fiercely American and fiercely Muslim,without contradiction.The strength of the American Muslim identity has resulted in the emergence of several leading religious authorities in the United States, some of whom serve as advisors and role models to Muslim communities in Europe.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;But well, if by the ""enlightenment"" you meant that the US is a country that believes there is a single knowable universal truth and that one can easily access it if - if only - we discuss hard enough with other unbiased 100% rational individuals who obviously are all also trying to get to the truth in good faith, then maybe in those terms the mainstream US ideology (and self-perception) is the most enlightened of them all, but I don't think so lowly of the philosophers of the enlightenment era to accept that they knew so little about reality and humanity as that, even if some of them were rather more optimistic than history showed they should have been.

There are certainly universal truths, though I never said America was the only country to believe/pursue them. You can mock the marketplace of ideas all you want (which you incorrectly assume includes bad-faith arguments), but it's the best way to cultivate a proper society that can think critically (which we and the rest of the world need dearly).

They don't. They do care about the pro-Brexit radicals within their own party, who might attempt to usurp their control over the Conservative party. The current government originally came into power by toppling Mrs. May's government. They overtook her on the right by going for a more radical pro-Brexit and anti-EU stance. Now they must make sure the same does not happen to them too. Revolutions tend to eat their own children, and Brexit is unlikely to be an exception. I don't think they can afford to take a less radical stance: every compromise will be a betrayal and every trade off a defeat.

They also care about the pro-Brexit tabloids, who can make them or break them.

I might be seeing this wrong (because I'm a foreigner and the intricacies of UK politics escape me) but it seems to me that the current UK government got into power on a mandate that it can not deliver: the UK will not profit from Brexit and will in no practical way become master of its own fate (quite the reverse, it is set to become a pawn in the USA's or the EU's game). So the only thing left now is to play for the optics: make sure you do not look bad and blame it on someone else.

As for games, hoo boy. I got a lot of them. 

#Valkyria Chronicles 3 Extra Edition

My favourite is definitely **Valkyria Chronicles 3: Extra Edition**. 

It has a translation English patch and it is pretty great for a PSP game. Make damn sure that it is Extra Edition, don't waste your time with the original (EE brought in a ton of stuff to the game and is the best version). I strongly recommend this game regardless of who you are, WW2 military style game with real time strategy gameplay. Has a mature storyline with controversial topics and a loveable cast of characters (villains as well) with a good score. The most rewarding game on the entire list. If you want to PM me, I can send a link for this one as I want people to play it or you can find it online. 

#List of games

Other games are in the list. I am not saying you have to try all of these, just pick whatever interests you: 


- Fate Unlimited Codes (2.5D Anime fighting game that actually controls well. You literally cannot buy this game anymore no matter where you go for licencing reasons. I strongly recommend downloading it.)

- Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker (Third person shooter/stealth game, a little clunky but the experience is great once you get used to it)

- Patchwork Heroes (Unique game that is a puzzle and action at the same time, fun and weird)

- Tales Of Eternia (2D JRPG in real time, pretty solid overall. The worst thing is the voice acting but the rest of the game is great for even people who don't like JRPGs in general. Big fan of characters and story.)

- Prinny 1 and 2 (You play as a penguin with knives in a platformer? Looks cute and colourful? Yeah, it is literally Hell. The game looks easy? Dark Souls is a snack compared to this game, it is HARD and damn it, it is fun! Very silly game but enjoyable. Just never throw your PSP Go.) 

- Fate Extra (Really weird JRPG based on a battle royal concept with so much detail put into it, I sunk a ton of hours into this game and find it very charming, save often though. Has a great story overall.)

- LocoRoco 1 &amp; 2 (Unique platformer, really suitable for kids and all ages. You only use L and R to tilt and both buttons to jump. It is a very happy game.)

- Phantom Brave The Bermuda Triangle (SRPG that has a ton of customization that is unrivalled. A moving storyline and the freedom of what you can do is quite fun to have.)

- Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy (a 3D fighting game that is strange but very fun, not much of a fan of FF and I enjoyed this game a lot). 

- Disgaea 2 Dark Hero Days (SRPG that is really customizable, made by the same people as Phantom Brave and in the same world as Prinny games. Silly, fun yet extensive.)

- Half Minute Hero (Only 30 seconds to save the world? That's basically this game, pretty fun for short sessions.)

- Blazblue series (2D fighting game with a large cast of unique characters, each play differently. Nice sprite art)

- Persona 3 Portable (I am torn on this game, it is fantastic for a JRPG as it is rather dark/mature but I feel that Persona 3 FES on PS2/3 is the best way to experience the game due to extras and better graphics. This does have the unique girl mode that changes a lot of things up. About the dark hour where people go insane and die in a world that pops up only at 12am, summon monsters by shooting yourself. Has a ton of choices.)

- Star Ocean 2nd Evolution (JRPG based on space exploration being trapped on a primitive planet and with a real time battle system.)

- Final Fantasy Tactics: The War Of Lions (Rather popular SRPG that is pretty good, based on medieval Europe.)

- Yggdra Union and Knights in the Nightmare (These games are so weird. They are difficult, long with a steep learning curve and with gameplay systems that are unique. Knights is definitely the strangest of the bunch being several genres in one for gameplay.)

- Crazy Taxi Fare Wars (It is crazy taxi but portable. What more could you want?)

- Resistance Retribution (Third person shooter against creepy aliens, decent game)

- Motorstorm Artic Edge (Racing game with bikes and ATV's, easy to control but can get wild with others trying to knock you off track)

- Gran Turismo (Hard to control, difficult but rewarding for those who want a realistic racer on PSP)

- WipeOut series (Future racer with techno music, learning curve at first)

- Crisis Core FFVll (3D JRPG with real time combat, play this before you play FF7 on PS4)

- Danganronpa (Visual Novel that is about teens getting stuck in a facility and they keep getting killed, mystery with strange cast.)

- Tekken 6 (Western style 2.5 fighter, fun for people interested in the series)

So this list went on longer than expected but I had a fun time of going through my save file of games I had tried in the past. You can usually find these games on websites with a quick Google search. 

ISOs are usually bigger but run better with fewer load times, CSO have longer load times but with lower space. Doesn't make too much of a difference.

Dit protest ging tegelijkertijd ook over racisme binnen Nederland en binnen de EU. Niemand ontkent, bijvoorbeeld, dat landen zoals Polen en Hongarije zich xenofobisch opstellen. Als je buiten de grenzen van de EU kijkt - maar nog steeds binnen Europa -, dan zie je landen zoals Turkije en Rusland die genocides ontkennen. Binnen Nederland hebben wij (gelukkig) geen genocides, maar je hebt wel extra belastingcontroles voor buitenlands-klinkende achternamen, ethnisch profileren voor Turks- en Marrokaans-Nederlandse jeugd, en discriminatie op de arbeidsmarkt. Omdat de situatie ergens anders erger is, betekent dat niet dat wij al perfect zijn, helaas.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit; In eerste instantie wilde ik alleen een berichtje achterlaten t.a.v. een misverstand over het onderwerp van het protest. Echter, om teveel berichtjes over corona-maatregelen te voorkomen, wil ik ook mijn mening delen over protesteren tijdens een pandemie. Het kan levensgevaarlijk zijn, voor jezelf en voor anderen, om je aan zo veel mensen bloot te stellen tijdens het virus. Was het protest een ongeleid projectiel? Nee, er waren verschillende maatregelen getroffen, zoals de oproep om mondkapjes te dragen, vrijwilligers die rondliepen met ""1.5m afstand""-bordjes en disinfecteermiddel, en stickers op de grond op 1.5m afstand waar protesteerders konden staan. Waren deze maatregelen voldoende? Nee, er waren te veel mensen aanwezig om aan de 1.5m afstand te voldoen. De politie kon deze maatregel ook niet afdwingen, omdat de agenten zelf geen mondkapjes droegen (wat erg opmerkelijk is), en zichzelf dus in gevaar konden brengen. Als ik het goed heb, dan komt er nog een protest in Den Haag, en een protest in Rotterdam. Ik hoop dat de gemeentes en de protest-organisatie deze protesten op een veiligere manier kunnen organiseren, zoals een boven-limiet op het aantal protesteerders dat toegelaten wordt. Als je dit leest en zelf van plan bent te protesteren, wees alsjeblieft voorzichtig en let op de maatregelen! Ik hoop ook dat wij allemaal meer verantwoordelijkheid kunnen dragen als Nederlanders. Blijf zoveel mogelijk binnen en wacht nog even met een terrasje pakken met je vrienden. Draag ook zoveel mogelijk een mondkapje, het is jammer om te zien dat zoveel mensen compleet weigeren om een mondkapje te dragen.

Edit 2; Als je tegen racisme wilt protesteren, maar je wilt dit doen vanuit de veiligheid van je eigen huis, dan kan je verschillende dingen doen. Je kunt deze petitie ondertekenen als je tegen de moord op George Floyd bent:  [https://www.change.org/p/mayor-jacob-frey-justice-for-george-floyd](https://www.change.org/p/mayor-jacob-frey-justice-for-george-floyd) .

My goal is to get healthy this year and reach probably 85-90kg.

Now I'm back on track and have been tracking my food for 7 days.
Although yesterday have been a bad day since I met up with a friend who wanted to share  a fast food coupon and after that my family made bbq. So the last 7 days I always stayed around 1500~ but yesterday went up to 2100. I did some extra walks so I could see a positive leftover in mfp but still felt kinda bad.

Today: 

- walked 4km to spot a lake near my city where I plan to swim from tomorrow

- had a healthy breakfast

- taking a walk after work

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Some said na it‚Äôs good kasi walang competition and that hahabulin ka kasi UPD graduate ka.

While it's true na wala kang competition for materials science-related jobs (e.g. in DOST), mahina ang demand for MatE in industry. The work you'll find (operations, process engineering) can be done by anyone with an engineering degree.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Tapos wala pa po atang licensure exam???

For me hindi naman naging factor ang engineering license if you're comparing degree programs in terms of their return on investment. Industrial engg and computer engg grads also don't have board exams but their starting salaries are often double that of civil engineers who do have boards. I also know 2 people from chem engg who didn't take their ChE board exams but they were still hired by Shell and P&amp;G immediately after graduating (but take note these people had a lot of extracurriculars in their CV and got awards from UP Engg when they graduated).

&amp;#x200B;

One advantage of the materials engineering program is that it's easy to find MS scholarships once you graduate. These are the places where some of my MatE alumni friends studied:

\- University of Virginia

\- Seoul National University

The rump Union, now a united bloc, continues its genteel decline, but Britain has become the most successful and competitive knowledge-based economy in the region. Our universities attract the world‚Äôs brightest students. We lead the way in software, biotech, law, finance and the audio-visual sector. We have forged a distinctive foreign policy, allied to Europe, but giving due weight to the US, India and other common-law, Anglophone democracies. 

More intangibly but no less significantly, we have recovered our self-belief. As [**Nicolas Sarkozy, President of the European Federation**](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/nicolas-sarkozy/11262713/Nicolas-Sarkozy-back-to-the-frontline-of-French-politics-and-straining-to-seize-the-Elysee.html), crossly put it: ‚ÄúBritain has become Hong Kong to Europe‚Äôs China.‚Äù 

Part of our success rests on bilateral free-trade agreements with the rest of the world. The EU has to weigh the interests of Italian textile manufacturers, French filmmakers, Polish farmers. Even Germany likes to defend its analogue-era giants against American internet challengers such as Google, Amazon, Facebook and Uber. 

Once [**outside the Common External Tariff**](http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/danielhannan/100186074/the-eu-is-not-a-free-trade-area-but-a-customs-union-until-we-understand-the-difference-the-debate-about-our-membership-is-meaningless/), the UK swiftly signed a slew of free-trade agreements, including with the US, India and Australia. Our policy is like Switzerland‚Äôs: we match EU trade negotiators when convenient, but go further when Brussels is reluctant to liberalise, as with China. [**Following Switzerland**](http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/danielhannan/100194407/outside-the-eu-we-should-aim-to-copy-switzerland-not-norway/), we forged overseas relationships while remaining full members of the EU‚Äôs common market ‚Äì covered by free movement of goods, services and capital. 

Non-EU trade matters more than ever. Since 2010, every region in the world has experienced significant economic growth ‚Äì except Europe. The prosperity of distant continents has spilled over into Britain. Our Atlantic ports, above all Glasgow and Liverpool, which were on the wrong side of the country when the EU‚Äôs customs duties were imposed in the Seventies, are entering a second golden age. 

London, too, is booming. Eurocrats never had much sympathy for financial services. As their regulations took effect ‚Äì a financial transactions tax, a ban on short-selling, restrictions on clearing, a bonus cap, windfall levies, micro-regulation of funds ‚Äì waves of young financiers brought their talents from Frankfurt, Paris and Milan to the City. 

Other EU regulations, often little known, had caused enormous damage. [**The Reach Directive, limiting chemical products, imposed huge costs on manufacturers**](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1439637/Christopher-Bookers-Notebook.html). The bans on vitamin supplements and herbal remedies had closed down many health shops. London‚Äôs art market had been brutalised by EU rules on VAT and retrospective taxation. All these sectors have revived. So have older industries. Our farmers, freed from the CAP, are world-beating. Our fisheries are once again a great renewable resource. Disapplying the EU‚Äôs rules on data management made Hoxton the global capital for software design. Scrapping EU rules on clinical trials allowed Britain to recover its place as a world leader in medical research. 

Universities no longer waste their time on Kafkaesque EU grant applications. Now, they compete on quality, attracting talent from every continent and charging accordingly. 

[**Immigration is keenly debated**](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/10534029/A-new-low-in-the-immigration-debate.html). Every year, Parliament votes on how many permits to make available for students, medical workers and refugees. Every would-be migrant can compete on an equal basis: the rules that privileged Europeans over Commonwealth citizens, often with family links to Britain, were dropped immediately after independence. 

[**Britain has been able to tap into its huge reserves of shale gas and oil**](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/oilandgas/11460993/Fracking-Ineos-invests-168m-in-IGas-shale-exploration-deal.html), which came on tap, almost providentially, just as North Sea gas was running out. At the same time, the free-trade deal with China has led to the import of cheap solar panels, which the EU had banned. They are now so integrated into buildings and vehicles that we barely notice them. Cheaper energy means lower production costs, more competitive exports and a boom all round. 

Unsurprisingly, several other European states opted for a similar deal. Some (Norway, Switzerland) came from the old European Free Trade Association; others (Sweden, Denmark) from the EU; yet others (Turkey, Georgia) from further afield. The United Kingdom leads a 21-state bloc that forms a common market with the EU 25, but remains outside their political structures. The EU 25, meanwhile, have pushed ahead with full integration, including a European army and police force and harmonised taxes, prompting Ireland and the Netherlands to announce referendums on whether to follow Britain. 

Best of all, we have cast off the pessimism that infected us during our EU years, the sense that we were too small to make a difference. As we left, we shook our heads, looked about, and realised that we were the fifth largest economy on Earth, the fourth military power, a leading member of the G8, a permanent seat-holder on the UN Security Council, and home to the world‚Äôs greatest city and most widely spoken language.

We are stumbling and groping towards no deal. It‚Äôs not that either side exactly wants the talks to fail: London and Brussels already have quite enough on their plates [with post-Covid recessions](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/05/29/coronavirus-has-derailed-eus-defence-dreams/). Rather, it‚Äôs that the EU has locked itself into a position that was designed not to get the best result for its 27 members, but to stop Brexit. Although several of the 27 now see the need for flexibility, flexibility is not the EU‚Äôs forte. Like a mastodon, ponderous and purblind, it pounds towards the precipice.

To understand how we got here, we need to go back to the aftermath of the 2016 referendum. Eurocrats were feeling shocked and bruised. They had not seen the result coming. Some of them felt a batsqueak of regret that they had so airily rejected David Cameron‚Äôs requests for decentralisation; but that only worsened their mood, for we are rarely so cross as when we inwardly blame ourselves.

In order to show the recalcitrant British that they were in no mind to compromise, they appointed a hardline federalist who had previously enraged the City of London as their Brexit negotiator. ‚ÄúI will have done my job,‚Äù Michel Barnier told EU leaders, ‚Äúif, in the end, the deal is so hard on the British that they‚Äôd [prefer to stay in the EU](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/05/12/covid-19-has-completely-sunk-chances-swift-eu-trade-deal/).‚Äù

His position had a certain logic. After all, the EU had overturned Eurosceptic referendum results in Denmark, France, Greece, the Netherlands and (twice) Ireland. Barnier duly began making deliberately outrageous demands in a bland tone. As long as he remained loftily dismissive, there [could be no deal](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/05/17/pesky-brexit-war-rear-head/); and since British MPs were not prepared to leave without a deal, that meant no Brexit. Even when, in late 2018, Theresa May offered to adopt EU standards unilaterally, to accept continuing jurisdiction from EU judges, to stay inside the EU‚Äôs tariff arrangements and to pay for the privilege, Barnier continued to say no.

In retrospect, that was the best offer he was going to get. Had it been made by any other country, the EU would have snatched at it greedily. But the moment passed and, when Boris Johnson took over as PM, he made no attempt to revive the model that Eurocrats had thrown back in his predecessor‚Äôs face. Instead, he took Barnier at his word. The Frenchman liked to brandish a chart with a staircase that supposedly showed that the only deal available to Britain was one like Canada‚Äôs. ‚ÄúFine then,‚Äù said Johnson. ‚ÄúCanada it is.‚Äù

At which point, Barnier swerved again, issuing another set of calculatedly impossible demands in his poker-faced manner. No, Britain could not, after all, have the sort of stripped-down deal that Canada has. It must first agree not to out-compete its neighbours, to open its waters to EU fishing vessels and to accept a continuing role for the European Court of Justice.

Perhaps three years of dealing with Theresa May had convinced Barnier that Britain would again bluster and fold. But things had changed across La Manche. December‚Äôs election had removed Parliament‚Äôs Brexit-blocking majority. The EU‚Äôs anti-Brexit strategy was redundant.

Understandably, perhaps, Eurocrats struggled to adapt to the new circumstances. They [still hated Brexit](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/2020/05/19/country-cannot-afford-extend-brexit-deadline/). Despite having promised in the Withdrawal Agreement to deliver a trade deal before the end of 2020, they began to agitate for an extension of the transition.

Johnson was never going to agree to that. The transition leaves Britain in the worst of all worlds, subject to the costs and obligations of EU membership but with no vote, no voice and no veto. A commitment not to prolong it is written into parliamentary statute.

But EU negotiators carried on trotting out the same tired old lines about cakes and cherries. They continued to demand that Britain postpone its final departure. When [the coronavirus hit](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/09/covid-19-has-put-eu-intensive-care/), EU negotiators saw yet another argument for delay. It did not seem to occur to them that, from a British point of view, the epidemic had the opposite effect.

The single biggest concern about a no-deal outcome in Whitehall had been the prospect of delays at the Channel ports. Not now. Global trade and international travel have collapsed. While both will have picked up by December, the prospect of queues in Kent is no longer a worry.

Indeed, the end of this year is precisely when British companies, emerging butterfly-like from the pupa of lockdown, will be spreading their wings. In a changed world, many firms will be looking for new suppliers and customers. That is the moment to [alter our terms of trade](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/05/29/exclusive-stilton-whisky-pork-pies-become-next-brexit-battleground/). It would be senseless ‚Äì reprehensible, indeed ‚Äì to leave our emerging businesses in limbo and then to impose the changes later.

For Britain, no deal will bring gains as well as losses. Yes, we will face more obstacles when we trade with the EU. But, from January 1, we shall have total freedom to deregulate, cut costs and remove trade barriers vis-√†-vis non-EU states. For the EU, by contrast, there is no upside. Its trade with Britain will be less straightforward and its budget smaller but, otherwise, nothing will change.

Some politicians in the 27 national capitals are uneasily aware that they are heading for a needless bust-up, and wonder why the Commission doesn‚Äôt offer [Britain the same basic deal](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/05/26/economy-track-rapid-v-shaped-recovery-says-bank-englands-chief/) as, say, Japan or South Korea. No one takes Barnier‚Äôs stated reason (geographical proximity) seriously. In any case, the UK has made clear that, if the EU doesn‚Äôt want a comprehensive trade deal, it will cheerfully settle for a looser one.

The fundamental problem is that, though Eurocrats are now intellectually reconciled to Brexit, they are not emotionally reconciled. If they can no longer stop it happening, at least they can try to stop it working.

But they can‚Äôt make life tougher for Britain without making it much tougher for their own countries. We keep being told, for example, that British banks and investment services might lose their unhindered access to Continental consumers. But this is the kind of mercantilist thinking that causes self-inflicted poverty. To the extent that the EU imposed barriers in financial services, it would be denying its companies access to the world‚Äôs best and cheapest money markets precisely when they need to recapitalise.

Stand back and look at how the EU is behaving. Faced with the [worst slump anyone has known](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/0/coronavirus-has-affected-economy-will-recession/), it is still more interested in teaching the British a lesson than in the prosperity of its own citizens.

Christ alive. I have explained this so many bloody times now. 

eSIMs existing does not mean that SIM cards cease to exist. Carriers will not implement this arbitrary fee when all the customer has to do is just say ""no thank you, I think I'll stick to my SIM card"". This then drives down the adoption rates of eSIMs, meaning it becomes economically infeasible to switch over to them wholesale because they will lose so many customers.

&gt;bellicose rhetoric mostly   

1) Turkey ran the Gaza blockade with the terrorist Mavi Mamara flotilla way back in 2010. I not gonna provide sources since you have to be under a rock to have missed that. The same IHH that ran that flotilla later reemerged as a big player supporting Islamic terrorists in Syria:   

https://www.investigativeproject.org/4278/turkish-charity-still-not-on-terror-list-despite

2) Turkey has a long history of blocking Israel's co-operation with NATO since as a member it can use a veto and it does: 

https://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Greek-ambassador-Despite-apology-Ankara-nixes-Israel-NATO-cooperation-325921

Turkey even blocks the EU often from co-operating with NATO even though most EU states are NATO members, saying that the Organization of the Islamic Conference(OIC) should be allowed to be participate also, first! See:   

&gt;http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/155284

&gt;Turkey said it will block EU participation in NATO summit unless the Organization of the Islamic Cooperation (OIC) is allowed to participate

Unbelievable and lunatic actions in the concrete, not just in rhetoric. Turkey also frequently blocks Cypriot(since ultra-nationalist Turkey doesn't recognize Cyprus as a state), Austrian(since they are Nazis for trying to get un-assimilate-able Turkish migrants to try to actually integrate to where they live instead of remaining Islamists or Turkish ultra-nationalists), co-operation, etc. See:   

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-referendum-nato-idUSKBN16M2OR

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40013507

3) Turkish navy forces an Israeli research ship out of the Cypriot EEZ since Turkey illegally claims that EEZ as its own and Cyprus is a midget state of less than 1 million(and thus can't afford a powerful navy):   

https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Turkish-Navy-engages-with-Israeli-research-ship-deporting-it-out-of-Cyprus-610923

I also have another post where I list some more very concrete and real Turkish actions:    

https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/gkbur9/israel_seeking_to_rebuild_full_diplomatic_ties/fqs4hi1?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x

But I remember you being very Turkophile in the past also, so I doubt facts sway you much.  

&gt;Also, Turkey's dispute over maritime borders is not necessarily part of his islamist vision

Yes, that makes it worse because even the fake secularist faction of Turkey also supports such bellicose revision and ultra-nationalism. So contrary to the lies of the fake secular faction, just Erdogan or the AKP in charge is not the issue. Here is a very good article I read on Dogu Perincek a leftist ultra-nationalist(which isn't much of a contradiction in Turkey) who is very influential in Turkish military circles. That article shows how deep and profoundly anti-Western is in Turkey, since the military circles that support are anti-NATO Eurasianists that want co-operation instead with China and Russia:

https://investigativejournal.org/the-strange-case-of-perincek-erdogan-and-the-russia-triangle/

Another article in the same vein:     
https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2020/01/turkey-ultra-secularist-man-said-to-be-behind-erdogan-policy.html  

So even if Erdogan is replaced it could likely be by a coup by Eurasianist anti-Western military officers supported by Percinek, as anti-Western sentiment is so strong in Turkey and always has been. 

&gt;They can't eat shit from Russia, Iran and Arab states who supply much of their fossil fuels to their power hungry industrial sectors for much longer.

What are you a Turkish ultra-nationalist, why do you care? And Turkey not having fossil fuel resources is ""eating shit""? So would you prefer the Turkish military bully regional countries including Israel that has companies like Delek Group and Avner that earned concessions in the Cypriot EEZ and which have had problems exploring in their concessions because of the Turkish navy? 

&gt;Turkey is a key trade partner of Israel and an important player in the region. 

That claptrap is why Turkey will likely never change. Turkey is screwing over Greece, Cyprus, Israel, Egypt, UAE, Saudi Arabia and so many others with its insurgent Islamist and ultra-nationalist(a lot of the fake secular Kemalists such much of this lunacy) foreign policy. These countries need to band together and start punish Turkey in the concrete especially economically. Putting out tourist advisories against visiting Turkey would be a good first step. None of the countries send millions of tourists to Turkey, but their combined tourist numbers to Turkey are very significant. Also selective sanctions should placed on Turkish goods.

We were made every 2-3 classes to watch videos on how great the EU is, yeah they helped built some roads but they have completely off railed our country.

In just a short amount of time they have eroded the Irish identity, put us in billions of euros of debt and taken any sovereignty we had, why did we even bother fighting England for 800 years to lower the Union Jack and raise the EU state flag, a powerful image 2 weeks ago of the Irish tricolour lowered and the EU flag at full mast in the Irish Parliament building says it all.

All the EU ever was, is that of a Neo-Empire ran by corrupt politicians and Bankers, the ECB (European central bank) has private owners, and German and French interests use it to whip smaller countries into shape.

The reason they imported a flood of migrants who are as I will say mostly not refugees but economic migrants is so they can give them benefits so they can act as future voters whilst crashing the economy cyclically so the rich bankers and ECB can buy up everyone‚Äôs assets with quantitative easing.

If you haven‚Äôt copped onto this yet just look at what the EU has done to Spain, Ireland, Greece, Italy and many others.....whilst Germany gets richer and France gains more political power.",False,False,False,,,0,1591098265,,False,0,{},fsmk31p,False,t3_guewhe,False,True,t1_fsjrzze,/r/europe/comments/guewhe/the_end_of_europes_chinese_dream/fsmk31p/,False,,1597016561,3,True,False,europe,t5_2qh4j,r/europe,public,,0,[],

In size and population America is not at the number one spot and the furthest from ongoing problems in comparison.

You can play the Texas example card but how much of the land is baron or unused?

&gt; BRUSSELS - The European Union on Tuesday joined a growing chorus of members of the Group of Seven major economic powers to insist that Russia must not be allowed back into the fold, after U.S. President Donald Trump said that he plans to invite the country to a G7 summit next fall.

&gt; Trump said Saturday that he is postponing next month&amp;#039;s G7 summit, and plans to invite Russia, Australia, South Korea and India when it does take place.

&gt; Asked whether Russia should be let back in, he said &amp;quot;We&amp;#039;re yet to see evidence of changed behavior that would justify its readmittance.""

Measuring total numbers is essentially useless when comparing a country of 330 million to a country of 50 million people.

Spain has an active secessionist movement with a decent portion of around 8 million people wanting to be completely independent. There is no similar movement in the US because there is no region there so culturally different from another region as Catalonia is from the rest of Spain. 

Spain has about 1 million native speakers of a language that is not even remotely related to Spanish (or indeed any other European languages). This region also had a secessionist movement at one point with an active independence seeking group (classified as a terrorist group).

As noted elsethread, ""Chinese style tea brewing"" means about as much as ""European style coffee brewing."" If you're OK with ""a style"" that encompasses commercial espresso, stovetop espresso, cafetiere, and various kinds of drip brewing and calls them all the same thing... I'm not sure what to say. Other than that you might want to examine your concepts a little more closely.

There are not many books about Chinese tea culture in English that survey methods of tea preparation. One such is Blofeld's [*Chinese Art of Tea*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0394737997/), though it's somewhat dated and limited to what the author encountered as he wandered around China before WWII. It was an amazing book 35 years ago, but there are now many China teas accessible to English-speakers that were uncommon or obscure regional productions back then.

There is much enthusiasm in this sub for small-pot/short-steep brewing methods, which people like to call ""gongfu"" though I sometimes doubt that ""great skill"" really describes what people are doing. For starting out with this, a good brewing vessel is a gaiwan.

Regardless of what you mean here by ""more democratic"", liberal democracies are all capitalist countries nonetheless and cops serve the same purpose in these countries and simply the fact that they have a ""better"" track record than those of the United States does not serve to imply that they are any less for protecting bourgeois property. As a European, I can vouch that cops in Europe are also terrible and police brutality is definitely an issue in all European liberal democracies: France being a particular case known for its track record against people of immigrant background as well as against protesters, and in Northern Ireland, Catholics are reported having constantly been harassed by predominantly Unionist Protestant cops. Even more heralded countries are no stranger to this; Sweden, for example, has been known to use illegal methods in order to restrain ""illegal"" immigrants. etc etc (examples are by no means limited to the countries I have just mentioned)

&gt; In my experience police officers are there to help and actively support initiatives for a better world 

Then it seems likely that your perception of cops is influenced by your own material conditions. While I have known cops to definitely do good things, such as mainly abandon their police history and work with comrades to expose the crimes of the police, none of this negates what had earlier been referred to by u/RazedEmmer

&gt; Do you honestly feel this way? Because that is a dark, dark pessimistic view you have there my friend.  
&gt;  
&gt; All that which we value as socialists, they will destroy 

The latter statement is absolutely true and in fact the protests erupting across the United States are indicative of this being brought out to a wider public. It has no bearing on any moral conclusion we will come to on cops, but simply, as socialists, our understanding of bourgeois institutions, what they represent and what they serve, hence as socialists we essentially have a duty to be sceptical of bourgeois institutions, not only the cops, but also the military and the feds. If you look at the history of the US for merely the last 100 years, you will see many examples of how government institutions have served to destroy anything we value as leftists: see the COINTELPRO and how they interfered with (to put it lightly) revolutionary movements in the US by imprisoning, humiliating and occasionally even assassinating Black revolutionaries, the American Indian Movement and other Native revolutionaries and Puerto Rican revolutionaries. See how the FBI has been involved in the surveillance and repression of leftist revolutionaries and how the CIA had been involved in the crack epidemic of the 80s and 90s.

O Lu√≠s Gon√ßalves, quando saiu, era o respons√°vel dos scouts. Tinhas uma estrutura muito bem montada e da qual j√° n√£o deve restar um unico profissional. Se ele fosse realmente bom, teria conseguido ir buscar novos jogadores e implementado uma boa metodologia de trabalho.

Description|Finally got this game, I was so excited for Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition on the Nintendo Switch. This game is just breathtaking, the environments, enemy designs and everything about it is just fantastic. I'm having so much fun so far so I thought I would get my thoughts out and tell you the 5 things I love about Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition. I will have my final thoughts on this game in July. I've played Xenoblade Chronicles on 3DS for about 10 hours and I've played loads of Xenoblade Chronicles 2 on Switch a while back, so far I love this series. Thanks so much for watching, I really appreciate it, let me know what your favourite things are about the game in the comments below‚§∂‚§∂Check out my new podcast: https://youtu.be/OFtkoa8eQhk‚§∂Twitter: https://twitter.com/AdziYT‚§∂Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/adziyt/?hl=en‚§∂Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/adzi‚§∂‚§∂#xenobladechronicles #xenobladedefinitiveedition #xenobladechroniclesdefinitiveedition‚§∂‚§∂A little about the game:‚§∂‚§∂Xenoblade Chronicles[b] is an open world action role-playing game developed by Monolith Soft and published by Nintendo for the Wii. Initially released in Japan in 2010, it was later released in the PAL region in 2011 and then in North America in 2012. A port for the New Nintendo 3DS was released in 2015, and a remake[c] for the Nintendo Switch was released in May of 2020. Xenoblade Chronicles is the first entry in the Xenoblade Chronicles series, a subseries which forms part of the Xeno metaseries. Although no direct narrative connections exist to previous Xeno games, it incorporates aesthetic and narrative elements from both fantasy and science fiction. The game features navigation through an open world split into zones, side-quests tied to party members' affinity, and a real-time action-based battle system which incorporates the main character's ability to see glimpses of the future.‚§∂‚§∂Xenoblade Chronicles takes place on the frozen bodies of two warring titans, the Bionis and the Mechonis. The people of Bionis, including the human-like Homs, are in a perpetual war with the Mechon machine race of Mechonis. Key to the Homs' efforts in fighting against the Mechon army is the Monado, a sword that is said to have been wielded by the Bionis. During an attack on his colony, the main protagonist Shulk discovers his ability to wield the Monado and sets out on a quest for revenge with his best friend, Reyn, with others joining in as the game progresses.‚§∂‚§∂The concept for Xenoblade Chronicles originated in June 2006 when the game's executive director and lead writer, Tetsuya Takahashi, visualized and then constructed a model of two giant gods frozen in place with people living on their bodies. Development began in 2007 under the title Monado: The Beginning of the World, though it was eventually rebranded with its current title in honor of Takahashi's previous work. The script was worked on by Takahashi, anime writer Yuichiro Takeda, and Nintendo writer Yurie Hattori. The music was handled by six different composers, including first-timer and lead composer Manami Kiyota and industry veterans Yoko Shimomura and Yasunori Mitsuda, with the latter writing the ending theme.‚§∂‚§∂The game was announced in 2009 under its original title and released in Japan the following year. Despite releasing in Europe and in Oceania, its North American release remained unconfirmed until December 2011, during which time a fan campaign called Operation Rainfall drew considerable attention to the game. Upon release, the game received critical acclaim as one of the best recent role-playing games, while its New Nintendo 3DS port was praised for successfully re-creating the game in portable form. It also met with commercial success in both Japan and the West. A spiritual successor by the same development team for the Wii U, Xenoblade Chronicles X, was released in 2015. A sequel for the Nintendo Switch, Xenoblade Chronicles 2, was released in 2017.

Se achares que deixei alguma coisa de fora 'a qual gostasses que eu respondesse ou clarificasse avisa-me. Vou tentar responder ao que est√° na outra thread aqui tamb√©m para ser mais f√°cil. Os pontos n√£o aparecem necessariamente por ordem.

1) H√° muita coisa que √© ""desnecess√°ria"" e n√£o √© por isso que √© imoral. Mas logo 'a partida eu j√° tenho problemas com a introdu√ß√£o da vari√°vel ""necess√°rio"", uma vez que para definires o que √© que constitui necess√°rio √© preciso teres algu√©m a arbitrar isso. E' necess√°rio eu gastar gastar 4‚Ç¨ numa tablete de chocolate quando h√° tabletes a 1‚Ç¨? N√£o. E' imoral? N√£o. Agora, eu percebo que n√£o √© o √∫nico crit√©rio e achas que s√≥ √© aplic√°vel em conjuga√ß√£o com a quest√£o do sofrimento. Mas se a raz√£o pela qual matar animais √© porque causa sofrimento **e** √© desnecess√°rio, ent√£o tens que definir melhor o que constitui necessidade. Podes dizer que n√£o √© necess√°rio matar animais porque h√° alternativas alimentares mas a√≠ eu dou-te o exemplo da tablete da chocolate.


2) N√£o sei como √© que ficaste com a ideia que os carnistas n√£o podem ser criticados e que acham que os vegans deveriam abandonar os seus valores pelos nossos, mas ok. Acho que nunca disse nem nunca vi ningu√©m a dizer que os vegans s√£o imorais por n√£o comerem carne ou que n√£o deviam faze-lo. Acho que o √∫nico argumento que fazemos ou pelo menos que eu tou a tentar fazer √© que comer carne n√£o √© imoral. Ou seja, a quest√£o e o debate √© apenas se comer carne √© imoral ou n√£o, n√£o estou a pedir para abandonares valores nenhuns teus. At√© podiamos chegar 'a conclus√£o que comer carne n√£o √© imoral e tu mesmo assim optarias por n√£o come-la. 


3) Disseste que que n√£o eras contra o sofrimento em termos absolutos e que √© poss√≠vel encontrar aspectos positivos de certos tipos de sofrimento, i.e. administra√ß√£o de uma vacina, mas que n√£o percebes como √© que o sofrimento de bili√µes de animais n√£o √© imoral em fun√ß√£o de ser completamente desnecess√°rio. Qual √© ent√£o o n√∫mero de animais v√≠timas de sofrimento que deixaria de ser imoral? Bili√µes deles para ti √© imoral. E se fossem centenas? O n√∫mero √© um factor ou usaste o ""bili√µes"" para shock value?

4) Eu dei o exemplo da melga que √© um animal. E tu disseste que as melgas n√£o possuem sistema nervoso central e disseste que √© no sistema nervoso central que tra√ßas a linha. Parece-me a mim ent√£o que matar animais n√£o √© imoral. Parece mais que a tua posi√ß√£o √© que matar animais com sistema nervoso central √© imoral. Queres ent√£o reformular a tua posi√ß√£o?

In spite of Japanese attempts to reinforce air defenses, B-29s would encounter nothing like the terribly bloody European raids of 1943-44. Furthermore, the shift to large night raids meant B-29s often operated in conditions utterly unlike the large daylight raids by B-17s and -24s. Yet further confusing issues are the technical problems (particularly engine issues) which plagued early B-29 operations.

That said: It is well understood that the B-29 flew at an altitude and speed which rendered it much more difficult to intercept. Even where Japanese fighters had sufficient altitude to reach the bombers, potential intercept time was much reduced and fighters were forced to spend much more time catching up; a late interception might even result in a missed encounter altogether. Furthermore, a high-altitude B-29 operated outside of the range of many Japanese anti-aircraft guns - already thin thin compared to German defenses - and those guns also lacked the high-accuracy fire-control radar and computers Germany produced in numbers.

I'm in Europe, and I have an A2 license (limited to 35 kW), and it'll be another year till I can get my unlimited A license. I'm looking for comfort, reasonable wind protection, and the ability to put up with the miles and freeway speeds, with the occasional weekend mountain twisties as an option.

At first I considered the Versys-X 300, but from what I've read it can get tiring on the freeway doing that speed (high revs to output enough power). The G 310 GS is underpowered and overpriced. 

So I moved to researching the CB500X, which looks like a good fit.

However, I've recently stumbled upon the newly released KTM 390 Adventure, and since it's new and with the current state of the world, I couldn't find enough reviews out there.

A brand new 390 Adventure costs LESS than a lightly used 2019+ CB500X, and comes with more equipment as standard! (there aren't any used 390s around at the moment)

The long question is: how do the two compare in expected maintenance/repair costs, usability, comfort, and other areas?

And the short question is: CB500X or KTM? Other recommendations?

I've noticed that you have some problems with reading, but yes ""gulags"" can't be plural physically. It's like saying 2020 romanian governments.

&gt; didn't exist

Of course existed, and repressions existed, and many punishments of 37-38 were unfair. 

&gt;didn't exist and only criminals were sent there

Of course vast majority were criminals by the USSR criminal code. Highly recommend to read ""polytical"" article 58, before continuing. 

So what crimes were considered ""polytical"" in USSR?

&gt;and there was complete freedom of speech

Do you have complete freedom of speech now? Go to romanian government building and test it. Let alone internet moderation.

Fact is - you did 0 research of question and exaggerate things tens-hundreds times at least.

&gt;You are accusing people you've never met

No, I've said that it is a general mechanism of getting rich in village. How else could you get rich? Buy a tractor? Dig gold? Became famous football player in 1940s? 

Thus, unless they are rare exception, they most likely had done things which are considered immoral and shady by todays measure.

&gt;because my great-grandmother's parents were hard working people

Ahahahahahahahah

Ahahahahha, i see, now i'm quite sure in my words above. And what do lazy villagers eat? How do they keep house warm? What do they drink? :)))

SYDNEY‚ÄîOne of Australia‚Äôs biggest states is pushing ahead on an infrastructure deal with China at a time when ties between Beijing and the federal government are at a new low, raising concerns that Chinese money may end up funding projects that are a national-security risk.

Victoria joined [China‚Äôs Belt and Road program](https://archive.is/o/oveqQ/https://www.wsj.com/articles/beijing-spins-a-web-of-chinese-infrastructure-1484560801?mod=article_inline&amp;mod=article_inline)‚Äîa trillion-dollar flagship foreign-policy initiative‚Äîin October. In recent days, the state‚Äôs premier, Daniel Andrews, has been touting it as a ‚Äúpassport to export‚Äù and a way to create jobs in a coronavirus-afflicted economy.

The deal is driving a wedge between the southeastern state and the government in Canberra, where views toward Beijing are hardening as [the two countries spar](https://archive.is/o/oveqQ/https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-clout-loses-punch-as-trading-partners-push-back-over-coronavirus-11589448604) over China‚Äôs handling of its coronavirus outbreak. An influential bloc of nationalist lawmakers is calling on the government to use the pandemic as a way to reshape the economy and reduce Australia‚Äôs reliance on China.

The Victorian deal pledges cooperation on infrastructure projects, as well as on biotechnology, advanced manufacturing and technological innovation. Melbourne, the Victorian capital, is home to many of Australia‚Äôs biotech startups and health-care companies.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison says that he didn‚Äôt support Victoria‚Äôs decision to sign up to the program and that it is ‚Äúusual practice for states to respect and recognize the role of the federal government in setting foreign policy.‚Äù The federal government wasn‚Äôt consulted on the October framework agreement, and the country‚Äôs foreign-affairs department was advised only on the day it was signed, an official said.

Clive Hamilton, a China expert at Charles Sturt University in Canberra, said Beijing‚Äôs strategy is ‚Äúusing the countryside to surround the city,‚Äù ramping up its influence efforts in state capitals. Washington‚Äôs hard-line policies on China means there has been a strong push in the U.S., too, to find alternate channels of engagement via local government leaders, he said.

A summit held in Lexington, Ky., in May last year is one such example, bringing together political officials from U.S. states, including Kentucky, Tennessee, Washington, Michigan and Colorado, and Chinese municipal- and provincial-level governments.

In Australia, tensions with Beijing have been increasing since 2018, when Canberra tightened counterespionage and foreign-interference laws and banned Chinese telecom companies Huawei Technologies Co. and [ZTE](https://archive.is/o/oveqQ/https://quotes.wsj.com/ZTCOY) Corp. [from its next-generation 5G mobile network](https://archive.is/o/oveqQ/https://www.wsj.com/articles/australia-bans-chinas-huawei-from-5g-network-rollout-1534992631), aligning it with U.S. policy on the matter and underscoring concerns about the possibility of cyberspying by Beijing.

The relationship deteriorated further in May when Beijing imposed tariffs on Australian barley exports and threatened a consumer boycott of Australian meat and wine, and visits by Chinese tourists and students, after Australian officials called for an investigation into any missteps that contributed to the coronavirus pandemic.

Beijing has denied the move was meant as economic coercion. But some lawmakers and security experts say the Victoria deal should be halted and reassessed in the rapidly changing geopolitical environment.

‚ÄúThe Victorian government‚Äôs Belt and Road activities are simply out of step with the new international and economic environment, including the now openly coercive directions that Beijing is taking with Canberra over trade and in government relations,‚Äù said Michael Shoebridge, a former top defense intelligence official and China hawk. ‚ÄúThe Victorian political leadership‚Äôs championing of the state‚Äôs tie-up with Beijing on infrastructure is a glaring wedge that Beijing is driving into Australia‚Äîat a time when national cohesion on dealing with the Chinese state is essential.‚Äù

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a television interview on May 24, threatened to ‚Äúsimply disconnect‚Äù from Australia, a defense ally and partner in the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network, if the deal affected the security of U.S. communications. The U.S. ambassador later clarified that Mr. Pompeo had said that he didn‚Äôt know the exact nature of the deal and that the security of Australia‚Äôs 5G telecommunications networks was a federal matter on which the U.S. and Australia are aligned.

A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said Belt and Road is an economic cooperation initiative that is ‚Äúcompletely reasonable, lawful and aboveboard.‚Äù

Some Australian lawmakers say the Belt and Road program heightens the risk of foreign interference. ‚ÄúVictoria needs to explain why it is the only state in the country that has entered into this agreement,‚Äù said Peter Dutton, the home-affairs minister.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all about jobs; it is as simple as that,‚Äù Mr. Andrews, the state premier, told reporters . ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to go to the hundreds and hundreds of businesses who send more products to China than they ever have and say that they shouldn‚Äôt.‚Äù

Many countries, including France, Canada, Australia and India, are stepping up scrutiny of foreign investment amid the economic fallout from the coronavirus, concerned that foreign entities could swoop on strategic assets weakened by the pandemic.

Security agencies are also ramping up their warnings about potential malicious cyberattacks, citing critical infrastructure facilities such as power and water-distribution networks, as well as transport and communications grids, as potential targets.

Australia‚Äôs top military cyber-defense agency, the Australian Signals Directorate, warned recently that malicious actors are actively targeting health-sector organizations and medical research facilities, possibly seeking information and intellectual property relating to vaccine development, treatments and research now of higher value and priority globally.

The agency didn‚Äôt specify, but it referred to Advanced Persistent Threat actors‚Äîthe term given to the most sophisticated and well-resourced type of malicious cyber adversary usually associated with nations.

Mr. Shoebridge, a director of defense, strategy and national security at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a nonpartisan security think tank, said that although they may appear to be just concrete and steel, many new infrastructure projects are ‚Äúlaced with digital technologies.‚Äù

China has framed the Belt and Road initiative as a way to more closely integrate its economy with those across Asia, Africa, Europe, the Middle East and Latin America, primarily through infrastructure projects. But security hawks say it is a coordinated campaign to extend its global political and military clout.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre after a much deeper, much more intrusive partnership,‚Äù said Mr. Shoebridge. ‚ÄúBiotechnology is part of the People‚Äôs Liberation Army‚Äôs vision of a future military power. To say these things are just science and just civilian activity is to misunderstand the Chinese state and the breadth of activities under the Belt and Road.‚Äù

You can make a pretty solid portfolio with only one or two ETFs, but since it sounds like you want to take some risk and speculate, you can always pick up some more ETFs that increase your exposure wherever you'd like. Most people here will tell you to keep things simple, that you only need two funds, no individual stocks, that you should avoid overlap and not speculate-- which is a strategy that definitely works. It's true that over the long term it's unlikely you'll do much better than that. But that doesn't mean there's anything wrong with getting a little more involved if you enjoy it.

My main driver is VTI, but I picked up a significant amount of VDE during the ongoing crisis. It's a bogle-no-no to speculate like that, especially because VTI already contains everything in VDE. But, in effect, what I did was just increase my portfolio's exposure to the energy sector relative to the rest of the market. When VDE recovers I'll sell it and reinvest the earnings back into VTI. VDE seems to have been a good bet so far, but remember that pretty much anytime you venture outside of wider index funds and government bonds, it's nothing more than that-- just a bet. You're gambling. Especially when it comes to individual stocks like airlines, go ahead and buy if you think there's an opportunity for a big return, there's nothing wrong with that, just make sure you only do it with money you're willing to lose.

Contributing more money every month (or more) is better than every three. That money isn't helping you witting around. I contribute a fixed amount out of each of my weekly paychecks, along with any surplus in my budget from the week before. I make at least one deposit every week.

Finally, some parting advice: European markets have been performing quite poorly relative to the American market in recent history. The European and American market have a sort of push-pull relationship where one gains when the other falls. Because of this, a lot of American investors diversify into European markets for when they pull ahead. If you're looking to branch out from a typical  whole market index, perhaps consider increasing your exposure to the American market such as through an S&amp;P500 index fund.

Also, let's even ignore that. Let's say that the 15y Polish kid was allowed to play in Poland full time by his parents, went and did it. It's still a change of environment for the kid, and it takes time to get used to it.

Not to mention going to another country, where the culture is diffrent, people speak a language unknown for you most likely (unless you go to UK), and the people around you in ur team are most likely older and have a different lifestyle from you.

* I installed a felt tongue pad in the right shoe cause i have a low volume right foot.  It can be removed.  I can remove it for you if you would like and clean up any residue.  Or I can leave it for you to decide if you want to remove it.  let me know before i ship the shoes.  
* Unfortunately, I just don't wear them very often cause I have too many shoes (according to my wife).  I am well versed with almost all Meermin lasts (and many other brands) so please feel free to contact with any sizing questions. I love talking about last fit.

9 days after the 1st case, he started up the COVID-19 Taskforce. 10 days after the first case, he started restricting travel to China. Meanwhile, a month after the first case, you had Democrat leaders inviting people out to dense sections to gather and mingle, because ""Trump is racist against Chinese people because he's restricting travel there!""

&gt;I feel like the economic downturn could of been better if he acted sooner and not dismissed a bunch of shit.

How much sooner did you want him to act? The economy wouldn't have been hit so hard, if maybe the Media didn't fear monger the public.

&gt;I do not doubt that. Europe has been more liberal than the US.  The things he has done like pull out of  WHO and weaken NATO and appoint shitty ambassadors has weakened our diplomatic standing and our ability to work with these countries.

WHO, who doesn't recognize Taiwan, and has been pushing Chinese propaganda...

And making nation's pay their fair share... It's cute. When other nations criticize America's Military Spending, yet directly benefit from not having to spend their own fair share...

&gt;If I wanted the US to be like Europe, I would move there. But I value diplomacy and Trump has very much destroyed a large portion of that.

Has he? You do realize, that there have been two clear acts of aggression on US areas, and we could have, in clear conscience, declared War. Yet, we didn't. If that's not being diplomatic, what do you want? The world's only Superpower to kowtow to everyone?

&gt;My issue with this is that this line of thinking leads to the prisoner's dilemma. And it works in reverse. ""Until conservatives can acknowledge when Obama did right, it will make it increasingly more difficult ..."". It works both ways. The left needs to reform the left and the right needs to reform the right. Change needs to happen from within. When some one on the outside tells you what you are doing wrong, most people take it a bad way. 

Depends on if one is just criticism, and the other is ""YER A NAZI! YOU HURT MY FEELINGS!""

I can give Obama credit on some things. But, why can't the Left give Trump credit on... Anything? Even your post does it. ""If he would have acted sooner..."", ""He's divisive..."", etc. Yet, I have never heard the Left give him credit for expanding, and putting more funds into Promise Zones. And that's just one issue.


Everything he does, has been spin to make him appear bad. And if they can't spin it, they don't report it. ""Good people in both sides"" is a prime example.

Sad to see you undermine the effect that Poland‚Äôs economic transformation plan had, and grossly overexaggerate the impact EU funds have instead (which is small, compared to the benefits that the Common EU market or Schengen zone give us)

[Poland grew immensely in the 90s and by the time it joined the EU, it had already been unrecognizable from its late 80s/early 90s times. It was actually poorer than Ukraine in 1990.

This kinda proves the propaganda argument though.

Bureaucrats in Belgium aren't deciding what happens in Britain. At all.

In fact, the UK gets special treatment in the EU.

The EU rules of free movement between countries don't affect the UK. The UK still uses pounds as well because they're not in the euro zone.

UK is literally getting favorite treatment in the EU, but still complain.

I can see why some people wanted to leave the EU for sovereignty, however I think you and me both know that's not why most people voted to leave.

It was mostly pushed by outrageous lies from conservatives about how much money the UK was ""losing"" because of the EU. 

&gt;It's not as though politics in the EU are never going to change.

No but what I'm trying to say is the following.

The EU has been more left than the US for several decades.

There is literally no way that the US will suddenly make a sudden jump to socialism, which is what conservatives use to fear monger.

&gt;You sound liberal and progressive which are admirable qualities but life is long and if the history of the 20th century repeats itself in the 21st I fear your rational thinking liberalism will be left behind by radicals.

And then I will also oppose those radicals.

However history has shown a pendulum effect, instead of a slope effect.

Countries don't continue going left or right until the extreme, in fact they swing back and forth. In a lot of EU countries, right wing parties, including radical fascist ones, are gaining ground and growing.

Those are currently a much more realistic threat than socialism in the EU.

&gt;The issue is that they are also teaching hate, sexism, and racism while claiming they are trying to end them.

I highly, extremely highly, disagree with this.

&gt;I don't care about someone's gender, race, or sexual identity because I consider them irrelevant when interacting with people.

Which is great, that's how it should be.

&gt; Gender, sexuality, race, and social justice studies do the opposite and put them at the forefront of every interaction. I don't deny that people have been and are discriminated against for these things but the solution is not teaching people that straight white men have been dominating them for centuries and that it's their fault we're in the state we're in.

I disagree that these studies are doing the opposite.

If you, by nature, don't care about a person's gender, race, sexual identity, ... that's great. It's amazing in fact.

For a lot of people, including me, it sometimes takes conscious awareness to treat people like that.

There are a lot of ways people get discriminated. Sometimes people even do these things, without knowing they are a sort of discrimination. 

I very often hear the claim that universities are ""teaching people that straight white men have been dominating them for centuries and that it's their fault we're in the state we're in."", but never see any evidence to support this claim at all.

I personally think that's part of conservatives playing the victim, which they often do.

Same way they get offended when a person says ""Black Lives matters"" and retort with ""No, all lives matter.""

Teaching people about the historical atrocities committed by people, making them extra aware of hidden ways systematic racism continues oppressing people, ... is not a bad thing and it's not an attack on ""white people"". 

&gt;True equality means judgment of character and nothing else and so this is what I practice is my day to day life.

I agree and I agree every person should be like this, but that is not the case. 

&gt;True change is only accomplished by individual actions. I learned that in the real world despite what I was told during my 4 years of university.

What exactly do you mean with ""individual actions""? 

True change can be accomplished in many ways, in my opinion. Educating people can cause change. Riots can cause change. Most things in between can cause change.

&gt;I fear automation will destroy the purpose in people's lives and we will no longer function as a society that works together to perpetuate itself because all of the work that goes into that will be done by robots in the name of profit.

I personally think automation is a great thing, but our society (and especially the people) will have to change until it can be used correctly.

Automation means things are cheaper to produce, which means establishing a social floor will become easier.

The purpose in people's lives shouldn't be working, in my opinion. It should be passion. That can be passion for studying engineering, passion for singing, passion for programming, passion for launching rockets, ...

But if automation can establish a social floor for everyone and people are free to chase their passion, I think humanity will be pushed further than ever in many fields.

Scientists will still have break troughs, because for many of them that is their passion. No one is passionate about working in an Amazon warehouse, so it's a good thing that will be automated. As long as the social floor is in place to help the people who lose their jobs.

That's why I think a universal basic income will be critical for society in the coming decades. 

&gt;I agree that wealth is used by people to exert their power over others but how am I supposed to change that except by not doing it myself? I practice and try not to preach. I understand the desire to want to change the entire world but you and I don't have the power. It's more effective to better yourself and watch your immediate surroundings change themselves to fit your positive effect.

You can change that by calling people out who don't do this. You can do this by not financially supporting the people who do this. Stop buying from amazon, delete facebook, ...

These are all tiny steps and won't make a change when it's only you doing it. But you can highlight this inequality and hope that others will take the same actions as you will.

The biggest thing you can do is voting on the correct people. It's a known fact that conservatives will never ever try to change this aspect of society. So if you truly want to help fix this, never vote for a conservative again.

Sadly in the current US climate, the non-conservative candidate also won't fix this, but it's a step in the right direction.

&gt;Of course bribing politicians should be abolished and of course crony capitalism is as broken as communism. It's a balancing act between the two which is why my point from the beginning of this post has been to try to mend the divide between both factions because most people don't want either one. 

I personally disagree that most people don't want either one. The whole ""pull yourself up by your bootstraps"" mentality is still very strong among conservatives. They do seem to want capitalism in it's current state in the US.

I agree that the divide between factions has to be mended, however that can only happen when both sides want to mend it.

You can't be tolerant to intolerance. 

&gt;Despite what you think about Trump supporters, and you certainly have your reason to dislike them, they are human beings trying their best to survive in our strange world and we must treat them as such.

I disagree that they are trying their best. They are trying to survive, but what they want most of all is feel superior to others.

That is why Trump's entire platform revolves around and also why he appeals to insecure people so much. 

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/11/29/how-donald-trump-appeals-to-men-secretly-insecure-about-their-manhood/

I think that insecurity is also tied to the conservatives attacking universities.

It's possible some feel insecure about their own intelligence (because they didn't go to college, for example). Instead of trying to fix that insecurity and learning new things (books, online courses, ...), they prefer to attack the ""other"" group, the ""smart people"", but claiming they are just delusional leftists.

This isn't the case for all conservatives, of course, but I do think that this kind of mindset is prevalent among them. Not only in regards to intelligence by the way.

I just think that when they feel insecure or left behind in this world, they attack ""the other side"" instead of trying to improve themselves.

This is something Trump himself also does constantly. His supporters as well. That's the origin behind the whole ""orange man bad"" spam.

Anything that is against ""them"" is fake, or said by delusional people, or said because people blindly hate Trump,... 

No matter what Trump does, they will never recognize and admit he is wrong. They will never want him to try and improve.

I'm not much good with hymenoptera (ants and wasps and stuff), let alone American ones.

Wikipedia tells me they're the only established hornet species in North America, though they arent native, having been introduced back in the 1800s.

As far as I'm aware, the Asian giant hornet has still only been seen twice in the US: the original sightings in Washington state.

Ironically, having spread panic about Asian 'murder hornets', the media are now reporting how people all over the country are mistakenly killing native wasps.
