Europe was a slaughterhouse during the middle-ages (called dark ages for a reason) and before nation states, so much that it makes the 20th century world wars look casual, and the concept of borders has brought us an unprecedented era of peace because we've learned to respect those arbitrary lines.

We rank 12/36 for healthcare spending to GDP in the OECD, or 13/36 for public spending alone. We did however rank 34/36 for efficiency in 2009, so that‚Äôs nothing new. 

It also seems to be increasingly left out of the debate that Blair used PFI deals which mean we owe 6x the actual cost of the projects in debt, ¬£300B as opposed to ¬£55B, which we are still saddled with today, instead of cheap public borrowing, just to keep it off of the official deficit figures. This was done so that they could borrow huge sums will feigning some level of fiscal discipline, while lining a few strategic pockets. 

No doubt the awkward fact that Labour left behind a trail of terrible decisions, not just the Tories (who certainly did too), won‚Äôt sit well with Reddit politics, so I expect to get downvoted for pointing it out, as I say, awkward.

Hello I am from Germany, do you think that today our countries are true friends or friendly rivals? I think the second, but this is your post so I want to know about you. Also what stereotypes of your country do you think is correct?|I honestly believe that the rivalry between France and Germany is over now. I know that both our countries have history, but from my perspective, both sides have been working hard to pick up the pieces. I haven't seen anyone trying to outdo the other in terms of political achievements either, but again I'm not super into the subjectn so take what I'm saying with a grain of salt ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø  I think the one stereotype I've seen around that actually holds true is that French people complain a lot, all the time, about literally anything. We really do lol  You'll see us complain about it being too windy, not windy enough, about being tired, about the weather being too dry or about people in general doing this or that wrong. We're not trying to be depressing or anything, it's just kinda our thing. It feels good to vent about the most mundane of things. It gives us something to talk about :)|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/gu9i3s/im_french_ama/fsh2o8v/)

Most of the oil and commodity trade is settled in dollars. Dollar debt is rising in developing countries and was valued at 3.8T USD. Therefore being the world reserve currency allows USA significant leeway in monetary policy.

Compare this to the Euro and the Kroner, the Euro share of central bank reserves is 20 percent compared to 2009 where it was 28 percent. The EU demographic is declining at a faster rate than USA. You can note this by comparing the median age which the EU median age is around 43 whilst USA is 38. As such, printing money for EU and Norway etc companies do not work because their currency is not a reserve currency, they have an aging demographic which basically mean their future economic prospects are limited. Moreover the EU has generous pension schemes whereby significant monetary policy might even cause political ramifications since pensioners remain an increasingly powerful political group. 

Therefore, the EU cannot print money endlessly but the US can as demand for dollar debt and dollars are generally high.

Very different brain and abilities. 
My logic is sound. I have pointed out many times how yours is not. Take that as you may. I suspect you'll ignore it. 
As far as communication, the numerous upvotes on my original comment would suggest I'm not doing too bad. As would the fact I scored in the top one percent of all people in the nation on English ACT and SAT. Your numerous and constant grammatical errors, along with your inability see basic inconsistencies and fallacies in what you write, would suggest your communication is what needs a little help (to be fair, you can't communicate anything other than drivel if your brain doesn't produce anything other than).

\&gt; Governments across Europe and North America have showed an almost callous disregard for the health of their citizens, and the world

\&gt; In Asia, meanwhile, oases of single-minded purpose have sprung up, sincere in their efforts to ‚Äòflatten the curve‚Äô of transmission

Citing Italy, Spain, France, and Britain as having ‚Äúarrogantly ignoring the signs of a creeping killer‚Äù, the article represented these nations as having treated the coronavirus as a distant foreign illness, ‚Äúthus stoking xenophobia among their populations‚Äù.

In contrast, the article cites Singapore, Taiwan, and Hong Kong as ‚Äúoases of calm‚Äù, characterizing them as having shown ‚Äúsingle-minded purpose and sincerity‚Äù in their efforts to contain the virus. South Korea os also praised highly, with Korea‚Äôs rapid and well organized implementation of effective containment measures being contrasted repeatedly with the comparatively slow, ineffectual, and poorly organized responses of Western nations.

In this article Western nations are depicted as xenophobic, lacking in communal spirit, and suffering from ‚Äúwilful ignorance of how interconnected the world is‚Äù. Their citizens are described as passive and inactive in the face of the pandemic, waiting helplessly for their inept governments to solve the problem for them.

Asian citizens in contrast, are depicted as socially responsible, full of public spirit, and dynamically active in the face of peril.

Recent scholarly literature indicates that the traditionally accepted dichotomy of Western societies as predominantly individualist and Eastern societies as predominantly collectivist is not as accurate as it once was, with several papers demonstrating a shift in values and attitudes on both sides, in particular individualism becoming more popular in the East.

Nevertheless, the traditional dichotomy is still widely viewed as accurate in Asia itself, where Western individualism is often equated with selfishness, and collectivism is seen as distinctly Asian. This article from the Shanghai China Morning Post is therefore not an anomaly, but an exhibition of mainstream Eastern perceptions of the West. The article also illustrates the fact that a specifically anti-Western sentiment still prevails in Asia, with so-called Western values contrasted unfavorably with so-called Asian values. 

There's a lengthy history of the concept of uniquely Asian values being used by governments of nations in the South East Asia Pacific region to attribute their rapid modernization to distinctively Asian modes of thought, and to argue for the superiority of their socio-economic status over supposedly economically stagnant and morally degenerate Western nations.",True,False,False,,,0,1590981095,,False,0,{},fshmwj4,False,t3_gtvere,False,True,t1_fsgceow,/r/Anarchism/comments/gtvere/unpopular_opinion_this_year_in_some_ways_is_one/fshmwj4/,False,,1596925203,2,True,False,Anarchism,t5_2qh5j,r/Anarchism,public,,0,[],

The meeting was attended by the Ministers of State H.S.Puri and Som Parkash, Secretaries of the Department of Commerce, and Pharmaceuticals, and Officers from Departments of Commerce, Pharmaceuticals and Health.
During his interaction, Goyal lauded the pharma industry for making India proud, by rising to the occasion during the Covid crisis.¬†
He said that India has been recognized as the ‚ÄòPharmacy of the World‚Äô, as over 120 countries got some essential medicines, during the last two months, including 40 of them getting them in the form of grant, free of cost.¬†
He said that during the crisis, the officials of DGFT, MEA, Health and DoP burnt midnight oil to ensure that the export consignments are delivered at the earliest.¬†
The whole world appreciated India‚Äôs gesture, and this has swelled India‚Äôs goodwill and reputation.¬†
He said that India had adequate production capacity and abundant stock of HCQ and PCM for its projected domestic requirements, and putting restrictions on their exports was to ensure that the medicines are made available to all the needy nations, and no unscrupulous element stocks them for unwarranted gains.
The Pharma industry received accolades from the Minister for their extra-ordinary performance, in ensuring that the Country did not face any type of shortage of medicines during this period. ¬†
Goyal said that early announcement of the Lockdown helped the country in preventing and containing the scourge of pandemic, and also scaling up the health infrastructure and build capacity, besides generating awareness among the people about the precautions and preventive measures.¬†
He said that India has set an example, under the able guidance and leadership of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in being pro-active in management of Covid-19, and also following it up with welfare and relief packages for mitigating its consequences.
Goyal assured the industry that the Government will fully support the industry in its expansion, diversification and strengthening.¬†
He said that the industry has an important role to play in the Aatamnirbhar Bharat campaign. The country should become Aatmanirbhar in APIs as early as possible, as the government has taken a number of steps in this regard.¬†
It has already approved the scheme on Promotion of Bulk Drug Parks for financing Common Infrastructure Facilities in 3 Bulk Drug Parks.¬†
Also, Production Linked Incentive Scheme for promotion of domestic manufacturing of critical KSMs/Drug Intermediates and APIs in the country has been given a go ahead.
The Minister said that anti-dumping investigation process has been expedited. The Minister said that in case of ongoing bilateral FTAs, if any roadblock or unfair competition is being noticed, the Government may be informed and prompt remedial action will be taken. He said they should look at large untapped market in Eastern Europe and Russia.¬†
Calling upon a collaborative route in the R&amp;D efforts, Goyal said the Academicians, Universities, ICMR and private sector should join hands.¬†
Informing the gathering that the Government has decided to disinvest in certain Pharma PSUs, the Minister invited the Indian companies to use PSUs for plug and play model of manufacturing.¬†
The Minister assured the industry that all suggestions presented in the meeting will be quickly examined and wherever required, the inter-ministerial consultations will be completed at the earliest.

In english, that doesn't need to be said because the verb rarely changes. For example, for the verb ""to write"", if you are giving an order, you just say, for example ""hey, write this down for me"". In portuguese, however, the verb changes. Check out for example, the verb escrever (to write):

Eu escrevo (I write)

Tu escreves / Voc√™ escreve (you write)

Ele/ela escreve (he/she writes)

N√≥s escrevemos (we write)

V√≥s escreveis (you (plural) write - really really really not common in brazilian portuguese, we just use ""voc√™s escrevem"")

Eles escrevem (they write)

However, when you are giving an order, the verb is used like this:

Escreve (tu) - (You) write

Escreva (voc√™) - (You) write


This form is called the imperative. Same thing for the verb chamar in the post, which becomes ""chama"" or ""chame"" in the imperative form. Usually, you just take out the ""ar/er/ir"" and slap on ""a/e"" in its place (any of these two will mean basically the same thing, so don't worry about it). There are exceptions, though, for example the verb ""dormir"" (to sleep) becomes either ""dorme"" or ""durma"". 

Portuguese verbal conjugation is extremely complex, there are several situations and auxiliary verbs used to indicate various different times of the verb.

The whole idea of french settlers in NA was to build trading forts to trade with the native (Algonquin). No nation was displaced, or went to war with (not in the beginning, cultural assimilation happened during the 1800's-1900's). Most early colonist settled on unclaimed land on the east coast.

The big 2 groups where already a war with each other: Iroquois vs Algonquin. They were fighting for control of territory. You could argue that the european trade increased their need to more territory.

The french allied with their closest tribe (Algonquin), and the english/dutch with their closest tribe (Iroquois).

The iroquois displaced the Algonquin, and then they asked their french allies to help them. The french tried to negotiate a treaty, and after it failures, joined the war to help their allies. Iroquoi were stronger, took some land with the direct help of dutch weapons, and launched attacks on french settlers.

And, to do the story quick, the dutch got defeated by the english, the english didn't really helped the Iroquoi that much, the french really got tired of getting attacked and losing territory and France sent an army against them. The Iroquoi surrendered after that.

A peace treaty was formed afterward, and the Iroquoi started attacking the english instead. (lol)

The iroquoi, especially the Mohawk, is a weird case where their land claimed aren't cultural, or ancestral, but a land conquered from the french and Algonquian, that was recognized to them after a war treaty with the french. You can see the map drawn after the treaty:

And you haven't pointed to me having flawed logic at all, you've said I couldn't see the nuance over and over, but never pointed to where i've had some logical inconsistency or something.  Please, feel free to point to that so it can be addressed.  Where have I been illogical in some form?

&gt; As far as communication, the numerous upvotes on my original comment would suggest I'm not doing too bad.

Did you seriously just point to the comment that you edited after it got upvoted to say ""I'm getting upvotes on Reddit, so I'm assuming I'm being misunderstood.""  Like seriously?  Are you just trolling at this point, or am I missing some ""nuance"" again?  Not to mention upvotes being a metric of how well something was communicated is a pretty silly concept.

&gt;As would the fact I scored in the top one percent of all people in the nation on English ACT and SAT

I also scored quite well on those, though I do not recall the exact percentile since that was well over a decade ago and I do not repeat my test scores to random people frequently.  Those tests are a joke though.

&gt;Your numerous and constant grammatical errors

Ah the classic grammar rebuttal I see.  I find it fantastic that you bring this up in a post you don't bother using paragraphs in...

&gt;I know you people love to throw incel around, but I have some news for you. There is a 99.9 percent chance I get more pussy and ass than you do, seeing as I'm bisexual and attractive. I spent three years before college getting paid to wear stupid shit and walk down runways in Europe and NYC. Regardless of anything else, people want my cock because of my looks.

Hey, you come across as a classic incel pretty strongly (the whole Women should dress conservatively and then saying I should get back to the ktichen thing) is pretty classic.  Asking if you were one was totally justified I think.  Glad to know your not.

&gt;Not only this, I come from a very well off family. As in top one percent.

Hmmmmm, someone who was born into great circumstances expects others to just make their own success like you did (except you partially didn't, trust fund and all that).  You are aware of how crazy lucky you are and how much of a boost to your chances of success you had from that right?  And that it goes the other way, people born into shittier circumstances have a far harder time succeeding and getting out of where they are.

&gt;I'm also a diagnosed sociopath, so I just don't like people. Especially idiots, such as yourself.

Id believe it.  Its pretty clear you have little to no ability to shift your perspective and view things from other peoples standpoint.  Or put yourself in their position and imagine what it might be like.

So you a born into an affluent family, and lack empathy.  I feel like that basically 100% explains how your view on this thing can be so hilariously off.

&gt;I'm sure you won't believe all of this, because why would that guy be on Reddit talking to you right? Believe what you may, because I will still be me, you still be you, and reality will still be reality.

Most of what you've said is totally believeable because of how well it lines up actualy.  So you got that going for you sexy.

&gt;Decent effort at being an ass and sticking it to the man. Sorry you failed so horribly, not that you could have succeeded.

What, I wasn't attempting to stick it to the man or anything, you are very clearly not ""the man"" in that sense...  

&gt;When you're me, the vast majority of people are below in at least one significant way. 

Look, its the same for me (I guess not in the attractiveness department as I'm maybe above average face wise at best, but I am physicaly fit and athletic).  But its way better to not treat people as if they are below you so much.  If nothing else, your easy dismissal of others may make you miss something insightful on the rare occasion it comes around and make your position/stance on something less good then it could be.

Really it looks like this comes down to you being born in fantastic circumstances and not having the ability to see how ridiculous your idea of ""just shape up guys"" is when there is so much stacked against them.  TONS of people born in shitty conditions try as hard or harder then you have in your life, but get nowhere due to how stacked it was against them.  We need to eliminate that and bring the floor up.  Black communities and culture would get ""better"" as you say if we did that.  Fuck, thats demonstrably true in several areas.  It really seems like the no brainer thing to do to me.

There are numerous situations where it has been shown that researchers falsify data to ensure further funding, especially in areas related to smoking, oil and other hot button issues.  But if you look below the surface they are not so much lying as manipulating the data to support something.  

The overall rate of false discoveries is about 11% for the top 6 medical journals.  But if you dig deeper you see that it is not so much ""false"" as statistically not significant, but being touted as significant.  So an exaggeration rather than a lie. 

Meaning the ""scientists"" are not really ""lying"".  If this were really the case we'd best give up airplanes, elevators, aspirin, iPhones, plastic, microwave ovens, and so on. 

The studies on penis size are from various times and various areas.   Big ones (meaning large numbers of participants) on western male genitalia have been done in the US (2000+), Europe (2000+) and UK (15000+).  While worldwide we have large studies in China (5000+), Turkey (2000+), South Korea (a series of studies with 1000+).   

And somehow, across languages, across boarders and 10000s of miles and across 70 years all these scientists were able to work together and collude on an average penis size just to help us all feel better.  

I'm not seeing it.  I'm sorry, I want to help you out here.  But I just cannot see it.  Why would anyone falsify this data?  Who is to gain?  Someone somewhere would have to gain monetarily for this to really work.  But no one makes any money from a fake average.  

I would guess the opposite.  Let's try this ""logic"" thing again and see if it works any better than this silly ""science""...

If the real average was larger, then condom companies would loose money.  If the companies were producing condoms that were too small they would loose piles of money.  They would have to invest in their own studies to ensure that the product was successful.  Companies like Trojan or Durex would have to put in the time and effort to find the real average to ensure they were not producing a whole bunch of unusable product.

Most know the name to hold some level of disappointment. All of that changes in June. It's poised to grow like never before. Conservatively a doubling but it could push to a 1$.

Here's the bull case for it.

Let's start with the potential impending news. In their recent quarterly conference call they address two upcoming catalysts.

-One is their move into the European market. They mentioned that they were ""in the final stages of preparation to make the first batch of Probuphine next month for Molteni Farmaceutici, their EU partner"". This is a major milestone as the expand internationally.

-The next, but less significantly is the long awaited FDA approval of their virtual REMS training program (a response to the shelter in place). This would allow them to train health care workers to administer Probuphine in the states.
Now for the biggest concern in a penny stock: dilution and RS.

Rest assured, that concern does not exist here- for the time being. Primarily because the Reverse Split that was raised in the last shareholder meeting in December did not get a full turnout until March. They kept pushing it back month after month. Granted, the results did come in favor of ""Yes"" but they fell short the 10 million shares to get majority.

Here was the readout: Favor: 30,434,934 . Against: 25,292,616. Abstain: 798,345. They needed 41,614,025 in order for it to pass.

Which brings on the the upcoming shareholder meeting for June 30th. They're opting to go for an Authorized Share increase this time, seeking majority approval. Seeing the fate that befell them on the previous shareholder meeting, they would need to prove some level of competency going into this one. If management is able to convince the shareholder that they aren't completely worthless in the month of June, it may tilt the votes in their favor.

Immediate dilution would be the next biggest concern. And I can say with confidence that it will not happen in the month of June. They have only ""5,121,069 shares of common stock available for issuance"" according to the Def14A filing for the vote. That issued at a discount would hardly keep the lights on for a month. They also stated in their quarterly conference call that they had cash on hand until Q3.

With money running low and compliance (and continued listing) questionable, they need dazzle existing shareholders into giving them the second change they want- even if may not be deserved.

The Play:
Load up shares from .25-.30. Anything within the current range should be fine. The probability of new hitting grows with every passing week. If nothing drops this week, I'm confident in a W2 or W3 Press Release. The biggest headwind is the health of the market and it looks to be holding its own.

More recently they typically will have badly spoken Chinese instead and I think that is a much better option in comparison to fake Chinese, so I don't mind.

Japanese films often have people who supposedly lived in Germany and America speak horrible English and German. Chinese films have a lot of Eastern European non-native English speakers play Brits, so it goes the other way around too. 

I think as long as the actors can get the tone across I am completely fine with it. Often I just ignore the Chinese and pretend he is just speaking some dialect I have never heard of and read the text instead. There are only a few hundred thousand Chinese speakers in Germany and too insignificant of the target market population to cater to in any particular way.

I think that you have no idea what the ""North"" demanded.  If you had, you would have been using the term ""Nazi"" yourself.  In fact, as far as Greece goes, the creditors got everything they asked for.  The result was utter destruction, and tens of thousands of additional deaths by the contraction of the health care system.  Wages and pensions were cut, people starved or committed suicide, or just packed and left.   I do not know what was fuck**g noticed in the Netherlands, but whatever it was, it came from their collective arses....It was not the truth, or even close to the truth.  

Greece, Portugal and Ireland should have been allowed to default, as they should.  But Germany would have seen its banks destroyed (as they should have, for taking silly risks).  Thus, the Germans came up with the great idea of ""rescuing"" Greece and forcing the average Greek to pay the German banks!!  Thus, 93% of all ""rescue"" funds went straight back to the German banks with interest!!!  The money came from the outrageous taxing of the citizens (today Greece has the highest tax burden in the EU).  Even so, Greece, Cyprus, Portugal and others are still in ""debtor's prison"" from which they are not expected to exit before 2067!!!  So, now tell me again what was actually noticed in the ""North""???  Anything resembling reality or just the typical racist rants????

&gt; This might have happend faster if the South haven't pushed for month for Eurobonds that are simply not happening because they violate the democratic principle fundamentally. 

This utter bullshit passes for reality???  Eurobonds violate democratic principles???  Which are those, in particular????   I really have it up to here with these kinds of cheap tricks in which the thiefs get to keep their ill-gotten gains.

For real democracy in the EU, we need to dissolve the Euro.  Period.  The southern states will get their more flexible currencies and they would make the products of the North much more expensive, thus, boosting their exports and limiting their imports.  The North gets to take back its unemployment, which it has been ""exporting"" so nicely with its ""beggar thy neighbor"" policies.

It is crazy for Greece, Portugal, or Ireland (or Slovenia) to have the same currency as Germany.  The value of the Euro reflects mostly the German economy, not the economies of these countries.  Without their own currency, they are ""naked"" in the German attack on their markets.  It is progressively obvious that the Euro is a ""sick"" currency and it is getting sicker all the time.  

No solution is satisfactory for the south because we are dealing with open warfare.  It is preposterous to believe that a small economy can be as competitive as a major one.  Even if a Greek firm has a great idea, it simply does not have the capital, nor can it raise the capital to increase productivity to a level at which it would beat the German company.  Productivity depends on the introduction of new and improved methods and machinery (computers, integrated systems, robots, etc).  A vast economy can commandeer these resources, a small cannot, irrespective of the desire to work hard or having great ideas.  On top of that, having an unrepresentative currency is totally ridiculous.

Connectivity wise umidigi wins with wider range of lte connectivity in both fdd and udd ranges, doogee only works on limited range of fdd which makes me wonder how will mobile internet work on it in my country (poland)

Also umidigi comes with usb c which is less likely of breaking than typical micro usb port

There is also z2 with android 8.1 but i feel like its bit too dated to be worth investing into which as well fits in the price range and has more 6gb ram as opposed to 4gb on both a7 pro and n20

The n20 on the other hand wins by price it costs as little as 403pln which is around 70 usd the camrea, processor and gpu are both the same, screen is bigger but the tradeoff is 9ppi less, less lte range and micro usb port and older os than a7pro

Do you have a weighted vest? I've have one where you can vary the weight ([this one](https://www.bulldoggear.eu/products/weighted-vest)) - going from unweighted to 20lb is a too big a jump. Start out light and build up.

Where are you naturally gifted? I find push-ups the easier part of the exercise (which according to the posts I see here others find hard) and the squats hard (whereas others find them easy). Identify your weaknesses and make a plan. 

Break the exercise down:

* Can you run a mile with 10lb? How about 15lb or 20lb?
* Same with the pull-ups, push-ups and squats

Just doing WODs isn't the best plan here. Work on each of the exercises - I've found the [Russian Fighter Pull-Up Program](https://www.t-nation.com/training/tip-do-the-russian-fighter-pull-up-program) really useful. 

You say you're ""willing to workout everyday towards this goal"" - in my opinion this is a bad plan, your body needs rest. I know it's hard, but don't risk an injury as it will delay your progress. Build slowly over time, you have a year.

C'√® una nota azienda di telecomunicazioni che sta lavorando con una grossa azienda di automobili (non posso fare nomi perch√© √® ancora sotto NDA) per collegare tutte le varie macchine in 5g. Prima del 5g non si poteva fare, perch√© la latenza era troppo elevata. Sistemi propietari, per definizione, costano troppo: quando si standardizza una tecnologia, rendendola disponibile a chiunque, si abbassa il prezzo del prodotto. Inoltre, il vantaggio pi√π grande √® la semplicit√† con cui si riorganizza la fabbrica: dopo che hai finito di produrre il prodotto A, la catena passa a produrre il prodotto B. Bisogna riorganizzare completamente tutto, e ci vuole molto tempo per cambiare tutti i collegamenti in fibra ottica (diverse settimane, anche qui non posso dirti il tempo esatto). Usando il 5g, il tempo per cambiare la topologia della rete si riduce di molto, cosa che fa risparmiare una barca di soldi alle aziende.

Smart cities, per farla pi√π breve di prima, vuol dire automatizzare una citt√†: pensa per dire, che i cestini abbiano dei sensori, e mandino un segnale per essere svuotati solo quando sono pieni. In questo rendi molto pi√π efficiente il processo di svuotamento. Oppure, quando in sismografo sente una scossa sopra il 3 della scala Richter, fa diventare rossi tutti i semafori, cos√¨ evita incidenti.

La guida autonoma √® pi√π vicina di quanto si pensi. Tutte le case automobilistiche sono molto avanti con gli sviluppi. Ovviamente uscir√† prima su auto da 100k ‚Ç¨ e solo tra 15 anni sulla panda. In ogni caso, la comunicazione tra veicoli √® anche diretta (non solo in rete) e usa il 5g (bassa latenza e standardizzato). Al di l√† della vera e propria guida autonoma, molte tecnologie di sicurezza stanno venendo fuori, e l'unione europea dovrebbe standardizzarle a breve, che richiedono la comunicazione diretta dei veicoli.

Per quando riguarda il numero di utenti, anche l√¨ no: per gli utenti umani chiaramente s√¨, ma nei posti affollati andr√† decisamente meglio costando molto meno. Esempio, il concerto di Vasco ha richiesto l'installazione di una rete ad hoc, sia per i cittadini che per la polizia (di sicurezza). Se ci fosse stato gi√† il 5g, il numero di base station installate sarebbe diminuito a meno del 20% (anche qui non posso darti i numeri esatti, penso sia ancora sotto NDA). 
Per gli utenti iot invece i dispositivi aumentaranno sempre di pi√π, le proiezioni parlano di miliardi di utenti a breve. Per le comunicazioni iot la prima cosa che si vuole √® efficienza: un dispositivo vuoi che funzioni per 5-10 anni, senza dovergli cambiare batteria. In Italia, paese delle banane, LoRaWAN (standard iot)  non √® utilizzabile per motivi stupidi. Si potrebbe usare il NB-IoT, che √® uno standard molto recente del 4G, ma ha delle limitazioni, e appunto, con l'uscita ora del 5G non ha molto senso implementarlo, visto che il 5G garantisce pi√π utenti (decine di migliaia per km2) e consumi minori.",True,False,False,,,0,1590997694,,False,0,{},fsi8vwl,False,t3_gtfp74,False,False,t1_fshaqno,/r/italy/comments/gtfp74/un_club_delle_democrazie_per_il_5g_lidea_di/fsi8vwl/,False,,1596936372,3,True,False,italy,t5_2qkhk,r/italy,public,,0,[],

It was a war for territory in our case, tovarish. A war you forced us to join after annexing, as it is your custom, parts of our territories. In any case, Romania paid huge war reparations to the USSR, we lost territories, we were under the Soviet yoke for 40 years etc. We paid the price. When are you paying the price for all the millions of people that your country killed while ""liberating"" Eastern Europe? The millions killed for opposing the Soviet regime? The ones who were deported? The ones who died in gulags? 

&gt;Oh, eastern europeans are different, and those for them who are sellouts - well it's their choice, we don't wanna pay them for loyalty anymore.

Pay us for loyalty? No tovarish, you cannot afford to pay anyone for loyalty, you point a gun at their head and demand loyalty. Those times are gone for us, fortunately. 

&gt;If Germany is willingful to sponsor Poland-Baltics-Czechia-Bulgaria-Romania - let it be so. From other side they pay you from your own money by using you as market, bu-u-ut who cares, right?

Oh yes, look at Belarus, how rich they are and how well off they are, being Russian allies. 

&gt;Whoever thinks americans would fight for anyone except themselves - wasn't really paying attention to history.

No one claimed otherwise. It just so happens that our interests and their interests coincide: we both dislike you. There's a saying in Romanian: the enemy of my enemy is my friend. That's what we are doing.

&gt;Do they teach you how good NATO is in schools? You are so confident in this belief... Unless some bomb falls in your kitchen.

NATO is indeed great for us. Bombs fall in the kitchen of countries that are the enemies of NATO, not its own members. 

&gt;But a country with nukes and missiles to carry them can ;)

Sure, but no economy to support a war. Your economy kinda crashed after annexing Crimea and the sanctions were pretty light in my opinion, imagine in a full out war. You'd end up starving in no time, tovarish. Is that why you're trying to be buddies with the Chinese, so they would invest in your country a bit if war comes? 

&gt;Plus Italy internal market goes in euros, and Russian in rubles, which changes picture drastically. But why would dear mr. Antonescu care.

Oh yeah, the ruble is such a strong currency. 

&gt;But both of them were trained and equipped by your NATO. That's the saddest part of both conflicts.

I fail to remember the moment when Ukraine or Georgia joined NATO. The mere thought of joining it is what made you invade them. 

&gt;When your USA idols corrupt countries to organize wars (Saakashvili and Chinval and second maidan respectively) and later benefit from that. Trump-Zelensky, Biden-Burisma, Poroshenko military contracts etc. Well, if that's what you want for Romania - good luck.

Ah yes, it was Americans who started the wars in Georgia and Ukraine, of course. Poor Russia, just fighting for what's best for the Ukrainian people. Honestly, you're so far behind when it comes to some reasonable excuses, you're using the same old KGB theories from the 50s that no one with half a brain would believe.

You're argument implies that not speaking out against something can be construed as tacit support of it. Lewis has spoken out about the protests in America whereas he hasn't about the problems in the middle east, therefore, according to your post, he must have no real problem with it, or, at least, not overly care about it. 

My argument would be that caring for one thing is better than caring for nothing - even if you are a hypocrite.

I doubt you would argue that Kimi, in silently agreeing to race in Russia is a supporter of Russian foreign policy.

&gt; There is an aspect of history and British tastes involved here.
&gt; 
&gt; British fishermen for most of the 20th century actually had the reputation they ascribe to the Spanish and French - fairly in their case. The UK adopted steam trawlers early, along with power winches and equipment - indeed pre World War I. The result was the British (English and Scottish) fishermen 'raped' the fishing grounds of Norway, Iceland and the Newfoundland Grand Banks. These fisheries recovered during WW I and WW II, to start collapsing again when UK fishermen accessed them at the end of each war. A major factor in all of this was the UK national taste for deep sea white fish, Cod in particular, but also Haddock, etc. These fish are/were less abundant in British waters - preferring instead the northern colder waters of Norway, Iceland and the Grand Banks. The British public then and now largely eschew much of the inshore waters fish from UK waters, prawns, monkfish, etc. Moreover, in the absence of a single market, these fish landed from UK couldn't make it sufficiently quickly to French, Spanish and the mainland European markets that actually like them.
&gt; 
&gt; The whole thing started to go 'pear-shaped' with the Norwegian Fishing Case which started in 1933, but was only ruled by and international tribunal on in 1951 - in which Norway gained the right to exclude UK trawlers from its fishing grounds. This caused the UK's rapacious fishing industry to increase its catches from the Grand Banks and Iceland, with two results - the Grand Banks Cod fishery slowly collapsed between 1969-1986, and the Icelanders decided they wanted UK trawlers controlled, which led to the successive Cod Wars from 1958-1976 during which the UK deployed the Navy to force access to Icelandic waters - but the UK lost in 1976.
&gt; 
&gt; Why does all of this matter. Because the UK was negotiating accession in the early 1970s - and at that time, the UK fishing industry had little serious interest the waters close to the UK, since its market was the UK - where the consumers preferred the deep water white fish from the Grand Banks and Iceland - and the UK was confident that it could continue to force access to those fish. The result was that the UK took a very relaxed view of UK waters with respect to the common fisheries policy.
&gt; 
&gt; What changed - well the UK lost the Cod Wars and due to the imminent collapse of the Grand Banks fisheries, by 1978 the Canadians started to take steps to restrict access to those waters for US and UK (and other) boats. Even so, the UK kept the lions share of the fishing quotas for UK inshore waters - 60-80%, allocating them to UK fishermen. The problem was, under the Thatcher administration, with its extreme capitalism, those quotas turned into property rights that could be sold - and retiring British fishermen sold them (screwing their heirs) in large quantities - so that Spanish, Netherland and French fishermen, so called quota hoppers, came to buy well over ¬Ω of those UK quotas. In this note the inherent dishonesty of the British fishermen's complain - their families chose to sell the quotas, 'trouser' the cash, then whinge about 'not having their cake and eating it.' By the way, this is going to add a multibillion cost to the Brexit bill if UK fishermen get what they want, as I'll explain below.
&gt; 
&gt; The second thing that changed was the Single Market - and seamless fast transport to the European mainland. All of a sudden fish landed in UK (and Irish) fishing ports could be at Les Halles for example, while still reasonably fresh - the fish the British public disdained could make it to France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain in time to secure a premium price. Suddenly the UK fishermen were resenting the deals that had been made in 1973 - and their own sale of quotas. But remember, the UK fishing industry had largely screwed itself, in part because they though they could keep screwing Iceland and Newfoundland.
&gt; 
&gt; Now the awkward details. UK fishermen dream of revoking the quota-hoppers rights to use the fishing quotas those UK fisherman sold; but international law would deny expropriation without compensation. So if those quotas are to be revoked, their EU owners will have to be compensated at current value - that bill will run into billions of pounds. And if the UK doesn't compensate for such expropriation, the consequences for foreign inward investment (in all UK assets and industries) would be dire. The second awkward problem addressed in this article, the UK industry needs seamless access to EU markets for the UK fish, because the UK public still doesn't really like those fish varieties.",True,False,False,,,0,1591004315,,False,0,{},fsiflkr,False,t3_gs20f1,False,True,t1_fsgz14m,/r/brexit/comments/gs20f1/what_are_the_ramifications_for_the_eu_27_in_a_no/fsiflkr/,False,,1596939710,1,True,False,brexit,t5_33mm8,r/brexit,public,,0,[],

I‚Äôve tried the pros cons list, and in my free time I‚Äôve explored the subjects that I value even tho they don‚Äôt provide traditional success or money. But I can‚Äôt escape the feeling that I‚Äôm wasting my potential. 

For example, I really like biology, animals, and most specifically monkeys. But dedicating my life to studying monkeys or working with monkeys seems like such a waste because it would require financial sacrifices for lower status. 

Part of my issue is that I do value success and money.  So combining that with a passion or interest is the difficult part. 

Honestly I think I will end up going to law school or start the track of graduate studies to become a professor. I always arrive at the conclusion that my interests aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive to my ambition. I could easily be a lawyer that focuses on animal abuse, for example. 

ENTJs typically don‚Äôt chart a middle course though and I‚Äôm also aware enough to realize once I‚Äôm in law school, I‚Äôll feel the same pull or push towards the more prestige or well paying types of law. 

The big issue I face more than career, is location. I‚Äôm not tied to any state. I‚Äôve lived in several already. And I‚Äôm completely clueless about where I want to live. I spend hours looking at google maps, comparing housing prices, job listings, making lists of my desired attributes, and I get stuck in decision paralysis.

[],,Fra_Bernardo,,,,[],,,,text,t2_4enm9dft,False,False,[],"The National Crime Agency hopes to turn illegal immigrants into whistleblowers against traffickers by offering them the possibility of improving their chances of staying in the UK.

The approach is aimed at achieving more arrests and convictions. Rob Richardson, head of the NCA slavery and human trafficking unit, said that prosecutions were difficult to secure unless victims went on the record.

In return for helping the police, they could have any potential immigration offences handled more sensitively, Mr Richardson said.

The NCA‚Äôs Operation Fort smashed a trafficking ring in the West Midlands last year. As many as 400 people, many of them Polish, were saved from rat- infested homes and menial, unpaid work.

The organisation‚Äôs intelligence gathering has been hampered by the coronavirus pandemic, with lockdown pushing [trafficking gangs](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/gangs-use-top-schools-to-traffic-asian-girls-p0vphpbmx) further underground and with fewer opportunities for the public to spot suspicious activities.

The new approach is intended to tackle one of the main problems: that those enslaved by the gangs fear speaking out because they are in the country illegally.

‚ÄúWe are saying to these people, through non-government organisations, that if they come forward we will look after them and safeguard them as a priority and their immigration status will be considered as a secondary factor,‚Äù Mr Richardson told *The Times*. ‚ÄúThe first thing we will do is look after these individuals and look after their wellbeing before we consider their immigration status.‚Äù

While this initiative stops short of a get-out-of-jail-free card for illegal workers, Mr Richardson said: ‚ÄúThere is a balance to be had. If people are in exploitative situations or are being exploited, we have a duty of care to them as well. If an immigration offence has been committed that would have to be investigated, but it would be investigated sensitively.‚Äù

There has been a ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù increase in [migrants crossing the Channel](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ministers-accused-of-paralysis-as-3-000-migrants-cross-the-channel-tqtj2pgg7) in dinghies in recent weeks. Lockdown has greatly restricted the activities of more accessible modes of illicit transport: lorries, the Channel Tunnel and ferries.

Fine weather has also improved conditions for risky crossings of the busiest shipping channel in the world. Many illegal migrants continue to come from Eritrea, China, eastern Europe and Vietnam, from where 39 men and women who suffocated in a lorry in Essex last year started their journey.

As lockdown lifts, the public are being warned to be wary of offers that seem too good to be true from businesses keen to win back customers. The NCA said that these discounts could be signs of modern slavery.

‚ÄúIf you are getting your nails done super cheaply or your car is getting washed for ¬£5, it‚Äôs usually because the people are not being paid properly to do that. Cheap takeaway food is another area of concern,‚Äù Mr Richardson said.

‚ÄúThere is a huge amount of information now about sweatshops abroad, but there is less awareness of things happening here. We need to get the public to ask questions. They need to ask, ‚ÄòHang on a minute, how can this possibly be so cheap? Is somebody suffering somewhere along the line?‚Äô ‚Äù

The NCA expected that the closure of many services for lockdown would result in illegal workers being abandoned on to the streets by gangs who had no use for them.

However, NCA intelligence and local police reports suggest that trafficked workers have been switched to other jobs. Sex workers have been forced instead into pay-per-view video sites where they work for online customers. Car wash workers may have been shifted into agriculture, factories and distribution centres to meet changing public demand.

Mr Richardson added: ‚ÄúOrganised crime moves to where there is an opportunity to make money. If it cannot make money where it is, it will move elsewhere.‚Äù

**Six in ten voters want tougher action against Channel dinghies**

Six out of ten people do not believe that the government is doing enough to tackle the increase in the number of crossing the Channel in small boats, a poll suggests (Richard Ford writes).

The number of migrants who have reached the UK this year will soon overtake the total who made the journey from France in the whole of last year. By last Thursday about 1,730 migrants had crossed the Channel, compared with 1,890 in 2019.

The government has paid almost ¬£62 million to the French in the past five years for joint initiatives intended to tackle illegal immigration.

Priti Patel, the home secretary, is looking at whether laws are needed to enable UK Border Force cutters to turn vessels back to France.

The Deltapoll, on behalf of Migration Watch UK, which campaigns for lower immigration, suggests that 60 per cent of those questioned did not believe the government was doing enough to stop the crossings.

The view was shared by supporters of all three major parties, with 66 per cent of Conservative supporters saying not enough was being done, 55 per cent of Labour supporters and 52 per cent of Liberal Democrats.

Alp Mehmet, chairman of Migration Watch UK, said: ‚ÄúThe public want their government to deliver on their promise to tackle illegal Channel crossing. If Priti Patel really is serious about getting a grip on this then that is good news. But it is deeds, rather than words, that will restore public confidence, stem the flow and ensure the taxpayer gets value for money.‚Äù

**Suspected online assaults on water plant and port offer clues to next stage of rivalry**

In early April, municipal workers at a water pumping station in central Israel noticed a warning from their computer systems ‚Äî a few pumps had been malfunctioning, turning off and on without being told to.

At first, it seemed innocuous ‚Äî water pumps are finicky and the malfunctions did not seem to disrupt the supply ‚Äî but within hours, investigators found something more ominous.

A piece of Iranian-written code had travelled around the world, passing through servers in the US and Europe to hide its origins, and finally to the commercially manufactured software controllers that operated the water pumps, according to four Israeli officials and a western intelligence official briefed on the findings.

Its suspected goal? To trick the computers into increasing the amount of chlorine added to the treated water that flows to Israeli homes, the western official said.

An Israeli official said the suspected attack ‚Äî the latest salvo in the four-decade hostility between the two countries ‚Äî had opened the door to ‚Äúan unpredictable risk scenario‚Äù. The official added that it had created a precedent for tit-for-tat cyber attacks on civilian infrastructure that both countries have so far avoided ‚Äî and may still be keen to avoid.

An Iranian regime insider dismissed the allegations.

‚ÄúIran cannot politically afford to try to poison Israeli civilians. And even if Iran did so, where is the Israelis‚Äô appropriate response?‚Äù the regime insider said. ‚ÄúOur suspicion is that Israelis want more money from the US and made up the whole thing. But the Americans are no idiots.‚Äù

Alireza Miryousefi, spokesman for Iran‚Äôs mission to the UN, said Iran‚Äôs cyber activities ‚Äúare purely defensive and protective‚Äù.

‚ÄúAs a victim of cyber warfare‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâand other cyber sabotages, we know well how destructive it can be,‚Äù Mr Miryousefi said. ‚ÄúWe have been continuously a target by malevolent forces, and will continue to defend against any attack.‚Äù

Both governments regularly accuse each other of nefarious activities and engage in propaganda.

The alleged Iranian cyber attack on the water plant could have triggered fail-safes that would have left tens of thousand of civilians and farms parched in the middle of an Israel heatwave, as the pumping station shut down when the excess chemical was detected. In the worst-case scenario, hundreds of people would have been at risk of becoming ill, said the western official, whose government was briefed on the attack.

‚ÄúIt was more sophisticated than they [Israel] initially thought,‚Äù the official said. ‚ÄúIt was close to successful, and it‚Äôs not fully clear why it didn‚Äôt succeed.‚Äù

Israel is now braced for further cyber attacks.

‚ÄúCyber winter is coming and coming even faster than I suspected,‚Äù Yigal Unna, the head of Israel‚Äôs National Cyber Directorate told a conference last week, without mentioning Iran‚Äôs alleged role in the suspected attack on the water station. ‚ÄúWe are just seeing the beginning ‚Äî we will remember this as a changing point in the history of modern cyber warfare.‚Äù

Israel officials said the Jewish state retaliated last month for the alleged Iranian attack.

Under orders from Naftali Bennett, then acting defence minister, Israel carried out a small, but sophisticated attack on the Shahid Rajaee Port, which handles nearly half of Iran‚Äôs foreign trade, according to two of the Israeli officials, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorised to discuss the issue in public.

‚ÄúIt was small, very small ‚Äî like a knock on the door,‚Äù said one official. ‚ÄúThink of it [as] a gentle reminder. ‚ÄòWe know where you live.‚Äô‚Äù

Neither Israel nor Iran have officially acknowledged targeting each other‚Äôs civilian infrastructure, nor have they publicly described the severity of the cyber attacks.

The Iranian regime insider said: ‚ÄúIranian ports are usually chaotic and disruptions happen.‚Äù

The Washington Post first reported the Israeli attack on the Iranian port, citing US intelligence officials. An Iranian government statement said Tehran was investigating the possibility of a cyber attack at the port.

Striking at Iranian civilian infrastructure was an escalation taken at the behest of Mr Bennett, who insisted on a visible response to the suspected attack on the water infrastructure, according to two Israeli officials. At the time, Mr Bennett‚Äôs tenure as caretaker defence minister was close to ending, as a new Israeli government had been agreed upon, but not sworn in.

Mr Bennett, who served in an elite military unit, and is considered more rightwing than prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, demanded a list of targets from the Israeli military, said two of the Israeli officials. His office declined to comment.

The Israel Defense Forces has a small cyber security unit specifically dedicated to probing enemy defences, including a still unclaimed attack using malware that ended up crippling Iran‚Äôs centrifuge program around 2010 that is widely attributed to Israel.

The port was ‚Äúroughly in the middle of the page of options,‚Äù said an Israeli official. ‚ÄúAny disruption would be economic, nobody‚Äôs safety would be placed at risk, they would be reminded we are here, we are watching.‚Äù

It is unclear how successful the attack was in disrupting the port‚Äôs activities, which are already chaotic due to sanctions that have crippled Iran‚Äôs economy. The western official said he was shown evidence of lines of trucks waiting to enter the port as the authorities sought to fix the damage.

‚ÄúSo Iran may have caused a temporary water shortage, and Israel may have caused a temporary traffic jam,‚Äù the official said. ‚ÄúIn the grand scheme of things, it‚Äôs nothing. But it never stops at that.‚Äù",True,False,False,,,0,1591012033,,False,0,{},fsinmas,True,t3_guj67f,False,True,t3_guj67f,/r/IntelligenceNews/comments/guj67f/israeliran_attacks_cyber_winter_is_coming/fsinmas/,False,,1596944381,1,True,False,IntelligenceNews,t5_3pmzv,r/IntelligenceNews,public,,0,[],

-Also research part is 1st person ""I am"", rest is 3rd person e.g. ""Created an open source pipeline to downsample 3D point clouds created from LiDAR scans displayed using Unity VR"", should be no I dids ever. Grammar and spelling are important for the dumbest of reasons, you have to remember there is someone underpaid doing the initial sift of CVs and they're bored out of their brain as all CVs are the same and they spend about 10 seconds having looking at each one and are just looking for any reason to put one above another. To you your CV is a pet, to them cattle.

-Decide what kinds of dev roles you're targeting have version for each: a backend core system one, a webapp fullstack type one, AI one

-Listing out all the subjects you did in your degree is overkill unless its relevant to the role you're going for, like if you're applying to Google Engineering and you did a module in compiler design cool, but Bank of X IT department not so much. No one will mark you down for this as this stage of you're career but when doing CVs always  think do I need this line, can the real estate be better used.

-Remember recruiters at the lower levels are basically human Regex expressions doing keyword pattern matching for commision, they don't know that if you know Java then you also can blag C#,C++, Kotlin or whatever.

-If you really like the look of a particular role, literally take the job description and rewrite your CV around it. How far you go is up to you, changing payment system to trading system to reporting systems etc might make all the difference. Java can turn to C# etc, if you get through to next round just cram for the tech interview.

-If you have a foreign sounding name, put ""Full right to live &amp; working in EU unsponsored"" down at the bottom. Just because you're not racist doesn't mean other people aren't and visa stuff is hassle.

Source for Ruthenian nobility is the fact that more than half of known Lithuanian noble families are in fact Ruthenian in origin. That includes Chodkiewicz, Oginski, Sapieha, Tyszkiewicz, Borkowski to name few.

Source for Ruthenian origin of GDL famous statutes is not only the language (Ruthenian) but also that their contents are based on old Rus' statutes, also known as ""ruskaja pravda"" which will become obvious if you will try reading them both. In fact, many parts are exact match.

GDL adopted Ruthenian titles as ""knyaz"", ""hetman"", ""boyar"" to name the better known. Most of which even have entered Lithuanian language itself.
In fact, as far as I know, there is not a single pre-renaissance historical source which calls any of Lithuanian rulers with any Lithuanian language-based title. GDL based sources, including the statutes, call the ruler ""velikij knyaz"" and country ""velikoye knyazstvo Litovskoje"".

Main language in a way that it was the language of court and majority of population. Lithuanian language was simply a vernacular which did not have any serious recognition back then. Same way as it was with practically all non written languages back then, which include English which did not have any recognition in England for more than 400 years when official language was French.


And in my opinion Scotland definitely is as much successor of British empire as England are. Because they obviously were an integrated and recognised part of the said entities titulary nation.

In reality, neither - nor Belarus, nor Lithuania are a real successor of GDL as lineage of succession was broken and there is nothing common between GDL and said countries juridically, ideologically or in any other way except some state symbols and matching territory. Just as it doesn't make a real sense to call Germany the successor of Holy Roman Empire because they share part of territory and the eagle or to call Romania the successor of the Roman empire because they share the name.

Slavery was not a concept that existed in these native cultures. 

They also did not fight other humans by principal. Which, was likely why they were sold into slavery by the English. They fought back when being massacred and raped by white colonists, sure... 

‚ÄúThe first slaves in the Americas were Native American and this business that the Native Americans died off as a result of disease and war [is inaccurate]‚Äîthose were not the only reasons for their demise, there was the Indian slave trade, which is something we do not discuss a lot.‚Äù - Dr. Arica Coleman ‚Äúthe Blood that Stay Pure‚Äù

Here‚Äôs a nice history lesson about the English‚Äôs first contact with the indigenous Australians:

‚ÄúAnother consequence of British colonisation was European seizure of land and water resources, with the decimation of kangaroo and other indigenous foodstuffs which continued throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries as rural lands were converted for sheep and cattle grazing. Settlers also participated in the rape and forcible prostitution of Aboriginal women.‚Äù

Lots of tribes counted only to 2 or 3. Anything more was ‚Äútoo many‚Äù. They didn‚Äôt feel they had the right to count, for only the Godhead or ‚Äúcounting god‚Äù had that right. Greed was not in ‚Äúnature‚Äù.

Instinctual survival is a thing, sure. If someone comes into your house to burn it, rapes your wife and tries to capture you to enslave you, would you defend yourself? This fear based defence only started when man became a great threat. These ideas of ‚Äúrape‚Äù, ‚Äúmurder‚Äù, ‚Äúslavery‚Äù, were unfathomable to the indigenous.

Saying these treacherous traits are in ‚Äúhuman nature‚Äù is a naive dismissal of these great problems. They do not belong in humanity, and I truly hope the world can see this eventually.

In fact, I loaded a backup save I made just before taking the MoH that I made in case I misunderstood its mechanics (you can never be too careful after spending 100 years doing ridiculous, stressful stuff in a challenge run).

If you didn't see that post: basically you no-CB and annex a Brazilian minor in colonial range, bankrupt off its province once all land is granted to vassals right before declaring a war in Europe to keep your allies, colonize to China, and then go to war with Ming for the mandate.

PHASE 1: UNIFYING CHINA

As we intend to keep the title of Emperor of China in this run rather than provoke the AI into usurping us, it's a great idea to actually be a good Emperor. That starts with taking Canton, Nanjing, and Beijing, each of which provides a ticking mandate penalty if the Emperor doesn't own *and* control it. So in the peace deal with Ming here, I took Nanjing and Canton on top of the Mandate, and I made sure to grab Beijing from the large neighboring Shun ASAP.

As the Emperor of china, you gain a handful of features that can be really helpful or really not. These were the focus of the run as I was constantly going to war with Chinese minors for a century until about 1635. I took advantage of a handful of things:

1.  The Unify China CB is ridiculous (50% cost, 150% prestige, and 50% AE for all provinces in China). I was constantly at war, taking 99% of overextension for ~68% warscore, leaving more than 30% for cash and miscellaneous demands. This was really important in keeping my economy afloat.

2. It's not actually all that hard to get to high mandate, provided you don't ever tank it for events or imperial reforms. 100 Mandate gives -2.5 national unrest, -10% stability cost modifier, and -0.03 ticking war exhaustion, which when combined with Humanist ideas is phenomenal at keeping an entire region full of non-accepted-culture, non-state-religion land happy with your Imperial reign.

3. Meritocracy bonuses can be quite helpful, especially the -10% dev cost + -10% core cost one.

4. Tributary states are a game-changer. With Exploration ideas, you can colonize every country-bordering uncolonized province in the game, and if you make the countries you briefly border happy with you, they'll gladly send you monetary or mana tribute every year for the rest of the game even if you lose your border. I was able to keep a large army and recklessly spend money on institutions and advisors, because large tributaries like Chagatai, Kilwa, and Venice would provide the bulk of the ~600 ducats (or like 35 admin/dip/mil) a year I was getting out of having Imperial tributaries.

PHASE 2: UNIFYING THE EMPIRE

So once all of the China region was taken (+ the one state in the Manchuria region that is charterable, I didn't want any AI European neighbors over there), it was time shift focus back to Europe. I began by taking Diplomatic ideas, but realized I needed to convert to Protestant to gain the favor of the electors. Despite being the Papal State tag, I could freely switch to protestant via the normal mechanics as I didn't have the Papacy government type.

At that point, it was a matter of making nice with electors, getting prestige up, and wondering what my legitimacy score was calculated off of for the purposes of the HRE election; it certainly wasn't Mandate or Meritocracy. Once elected, I set my sights on provinces in Europe that I could add for imperial authority -- I targetted the Ottomans first, who have a lot of land that HRE princes do not care if you annex. Using the power base I'd developed in China, I was able to raise an army to match theirs and cut a path from Lika to Constantinople+across the Sea of Marmara during the first war, then take more of the Balkans during the second and border Russia. From there on out, I rotated wars vs. The Ottomans, Russia, and any miscellaneous neighboring countries (poland was 98% warscore, which was nice) and allied any HRE countries with land outside the Empire (Bohemia, Switzerland, Sweden, and Pomerania).

During this span of time, I had a monthly ticking IA of either 0.0 or 0.10 during war/peace, so I added provinces to the HRE when I got them or when I converted them to Protestant if they started out Sunni (hence Religious Ideas 3).

After the second Ottoman war, I triggered and won Court and Country, which would have sent my country into permanent financial ruin if not for my large tributary network. I think this was worth it, as it represented a decent speeding up of the conquest for the run.

This series of wars eventually led to me getting the ~95 IA needed to convince former emperor Sweden to become my vassal, and from there it was easy to clean up borders and gain the necessary IA to press Renovatio Imperii -- and that was that.",True,False,False,,,0,1591017009,,1591106361,0,{},fsiubfr,True,t3_gujqay,False,False,t1_fsiqn2f,/r/eu4/comments/gujqay/the_holiest_roman_empire_youve_ever_seen_the/fsiubfr/,False,,1596947694,16,True,False,eu4,t5_2uqat,r/eu4,public,,0,[],

Here in France, we have also this defiance against police because of racist acts (hopefully not as many as in other places) and mostly for the way they treat protesters (mutilations have happened way too much with the Yellow Vest movement, which I participated to).

Police is the authority you are supposed to turn to when you need protection. When you see police brutality against people you compare yourself to, let's just say it makes people have noone to turn to in times of need. When you're a minority that's already feeling oppressed, I can only imagine how just another spark would lead to bigger riots.

Anger for being betrayed from those that sworn to defend you is pretty normal IMO. Generalization (even if I hate it) is also kind of explained by the fact the police forces never clean themselves. We (citizens) can hear everyone is not bad in the police, but if they don't single out and punish those bad ones, then it makes us think that the police can't make the difference between right or wrong when they investigate themselves.

I know I shouldn't expect to see the police force fix its issues online in a subreddit debate or even see pro police force talk about their issues. But when you compare the content of subs like this one or r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut you realize the gap between those protesting and those supporting police no matter what. 

&amp;#x200B;

To answer OP, u/mandolin6648, unless the police realizes they need to change, they just won't. In France, despite many videos and many witnesses of police brutality, nothing happened also because the politics behind not only supported the police but also gave them full access to the anti-riot tools even if the rioting only got up to one burnt car here and there and banks walls with graffitis and smashed doors.

With Trump's way of handling the situation, nothing will happen. Things would sadly need to escalate very very high for things to really happen.

It depends on how much you like medieval Europe! I have a history degree and focused a lot on European history during my studies so I find it to be really interesting and fun to play ""Europe, but the magic is real."" But the most important part of Ars to me is its dedication to the concept of playing a game as a wizard across a long span of time through its magic, Covenant, and aging systems.

Most of the principles should translate pretty smoothly to any given fantasy setting if you want them to. For example, wizards can still be distrusted because of The Gift and they can still be banned from meddling in politics using their magic (e.g. the ""no court wizards"" case law established on page 14 of the 5e core book). They can still be broken into Tribunals, they can still interact with religion as a real entity and delve into the philosophy of how separate their hermetic arts are from religious miracles (pending some changes given your setting wouldn't have the Roman church in it), and cities can still ruin magical auras and be poor places to set up magical residences. You may need to do slightly more work in dealing with the Infernal realm, which is rather directly based on the real-world cosmology of Christian Hell.

Basically the main thing you'd lose, aside from a niche appeal to history buffs like me, is that a lot of the adventures and setting materials outside the core book tie pretty closely to real historical events and places. But with a few judicious name changes even that could be overcome.

Hy everyone! New seller here, eager to do his first deal here on this sub!

Zenith's caliber 146D was the last chronograph movement produced until the introduction of the El Primero in 1969.

Overall, about 7/10 condition. It recently had a full service. The case and dial appear original. Case edges are nice and crisp. The dial does have some light spotting that is more noticeable indoors than out. The chronograph functions smoothly and as it should, resetting back to zero without issue. The crystal is clean and the watch keeps accurate time. It measures 35mm diameter without crown, 42mm lug to lug, and 18mm lug width.

I will send a watch in a watch box but I do not have the original one.

No one was paying attention in the crossroads of New York as I was giving my speech.

""M-m-mine...""

However, one person was intrigued in what I was saying.

""M-m-m-minecraft...""

Then it was just a domino effect, ten more people are watching.

""Minecraft...""

A hundred were now watching, this had caught the attention of even the busy drivers in rush hour. Their faces in anticipation, some were even scared. Others were complaining that this isn't the real deal.

""MINECRAFT...""

But they all suddenly started cheering, shaking, praying. When they heard my tone, my pitch, my timbre.... they all knew what was going to come next. They realized... that salvation of the human race has finally come.

""Minecraft good Fortnite bad""

And then the silence broke

""OOOIOIIUUUUUGHHHhJJHHHHHWAASEAAAa//::""

Thousands of people fell to their knees, yelling orgasmically. People starting crying tears of joy, others were running and thanking God, News reporters were already on the scene, broadcasting the entire thing nationwide and consequently the entire world. Hundreds of people came out of their cars, buses, taxis, stores, and subway stations hooting and hollering. It was a miracle unfolding.

I started to say the next sentence relayed to me by our Lord and Savior.

""M-m-mi... Mine...""

Already some people fainted at just the mere sound of my voice. Even more people came. Some were jumping from planes thousands of feet in the air, others ran or swam miles to here in mere seconds. I think I even spotted a few famous people.

""MINE...""

Nearly a million people were here now. There's now Europeans, Canadians, Mexicans, Latin Americans, West Coasters, Africans, and even several Asians and one Australian. They were screaming hysterically, bringing gifts for me, taking pictures and videos. Fireworks and confetti everywhere, helicopters, and even Donald Trump was here with his family bowing down to me.

""MINEC-C-C-CRAFT voice crack""

A billion people were here now. Even animals from all over the world were coming in herds. I could see Pewdiepie &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Martiza, Elon Musk, Keanu Reeves, Lil Nas X, 50 Cent, Oprah Winfrey, the Kardashians, and so many other people. Many people were having seizures, heart attacks, and strokes from the sheer excitement, and some were being trampled to death because of the huge crowd. The screaming was deafening. Some just came straight out of their bathroom, school, work, or their parenting... but it doesn't matter now.

""MMMMMMIIIIINNNNEEECRAAAFTTTTT""

No matter what was your race, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, religion, economic class, etc... it didn't matter. All of humanity has come together for this one moment. Millions of people have died to due plane crashes, car crashes, doctors abandoning their patients, parents abandoning their children... just to be here, but it will all be worth it.

Nearly half of humanity is here now. Even the dead came out their graves for this. Everyone is climbing on top of each other and on the walls of skyscrapers since they couldn't fit. So many lights, music, dancing, feasts... yet barely a minute passed. Humanity is very interesting.

10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

I look at the smiling faces of the crowd in front of me. I look at the death and destruction that came from sacrifice to attend this event. This is it. We're ready.

Billions of people around the world disintegrated into their pure chemical compounds that composed their bodies, then their atoms, then their protons/neutrons/electrons, and finally their quarks... as they heard that holy sentence. The distant echoes of yelling can heard from thousands of miles. This... this was their ultimate purpose in life. This is the culmination of everything that has happened in human history, it is reason why life even existed in the first place. They weren't screaming in terror, they were shouting in orgasmic joy. They could finally die happy. Their entire lives flashed before their eyes as they saw their loved ones. They saw their ultimate fantasy. They can finally be freed from their imperfect bodies in this imperfect world.

The Sun blinked out. The Moon crashed into the Earth. The Earth turned into dust. The Solar System collapsed into a state of entropy. The Milky Way hosts a firework show of supernovas. All the galaxies of the universe colliding with one another. Reality is falling apart. That's because reality doesn't need to exist anymore. It has reached its goal. Spacetime has fallen. Matter ceases to exist. Not even the concept of nothing exists. The universe was never born.

Humanity is gone. Everything is gone. We are now one. Evil doesn't exist anymore. Insecurities don't exist anymore. Fear, sadness, anger don't exist anymore. Just hope, love, and harmony for eternity. This is what we were meant to be. This is our final evolution stage.

This is heaven. This is what it means to be happy.

This is a genuine, honest and transparent response from a human being. Yes, Georgia has been able to partially open back up a few weeks ago. First of all - not everything is really open: many many stores are still closed. Best Buy is a good example (they only have curbside).

However, three things have happened:

\- Due to COVID and GA shutdown (but similar story in our UK facility), we had to shutdown a big amount of our operations for several weeks - with only a skeleton crew shipping pre-built controllers, accessories, and receiving inventory), creating a backlog for new orders and repairs that we're working tirelessly to catch up on (and doing so).

\- Due to a majority of the population being home (not just in the US, but worldwide), we've had increased demand that was something no one could have planned, and that also translated to a huge increase in ticket volume. With operations being slower, demand higher, transitioning employees and systems to WFH (+ of course not being able to on-board new employees to cope with the increased volume in a middle of a global pandemic), in order to ensure we can actually process all requests, we've moved everything to tickets and are currently clearing through the backlog. Again - the CS team is working hard on that, but it doesn't help when someone creates 3 separate tickets for the same issue and floods the system even more. Once we've caught up, I'm sure we'll open the phone lines as soon as possible.

\- Due to everyone being home, people have been gaming a lot more, thus, wearing their controllers faster, we've also had more repair requests, but our factory was shut down so we couldn't get controllers back. In the case of Europe, a lot of shipping carriers also no longer offered pick up or drop off for repairs too, creating an other backlog there that's completely outside of our control.

I genuinely understand your frustration, and we've repeatedly offered you our help via our reddit mods, and are doing so as much as we can here, so please bare with us as we deal with an un-precedented situation and I can ensure you - we have a lot of people working really hard to work through all backlog.",True,False,False,,,0,1591021584,,1591021885,0,{},fsj1um0,False,t3_grtfk9,False,True,t1_fs10mhq,/r/scufgaming/comments/grtfk9/controller_triggers/fsj1um0/,False,,1596951319,1,True,False,scufgaming,t5_345qp,r/scufgaming,public,,0,[],

&gt;Currently, a chemical under intense scrutiny is RoundUp, which has a bunch of problems of its own (including the possibility for pesticide-resistance and decimation of beneficial insects in the ecosystem).

An herbicide is 'decimating' beneficial insects? You sure about that?

&gt;they are actively eliminating biodiversity of plants by pushing limited strains. For example, 95% of bannanas are identical and could be wiped out by one disease - while GMO could help save the bannana, companies like Monsanto take advantage of situations like these and replace 1 strain with another, as to retain their monopoly. 

GMOs aren't clones. They don't reduce biodiversity because there aren't fewer GMO strains when compared to their non-GMO counterparts. 

You're repeating an unfounded myth with no basis in reality. 

&gt;Independent farmers often save seeds from their crop one year and plant the same ones the next, saving seed-buying costs and growing sustainably.

Modern commercial farmers haven't done this for decades. Not since the introduction of hybridization and the associated yield gains. 

This is a talking point repeated by people who have no understanding of farming. 

https://www.thefarmersdaughterusa.com/2016/02/no-farmers-dont-want-save-seeds.html

&gt;However, when farmers use Monsanto's plants, which are engineered to produce unviable seeds

Nope. No seeds have been engineered to be sterile. You seem to be hitting all of the easily debunked lies and misinformation.

&gt;In addition, if the GMO seeds are used again the next year, farmers are forced to pay a fee due to patent laws.

This isn't remotely a thing. And you need to consider your own beliefs here. If the seeds *were* sterile, how could they be planted the next year at all?

&gt;It's kind of messed up how companies like Monsanto lobby congress as well, allowing laws like these to be put into place.

What laws are you referring to? Farmers sign a contract to not save seed. There's no lobbying needed. 

Seriously, you should listen to farmers themselves.

And now you cite the most discredited person ever when talking about GMOs. Did you know that Seralini is secretly funded by homeopathic corporations?

&gt;Competing interests

&gt;The authors declare that they have no competing interests.

Let's see. Do you think being paid to come up with a homeopathic ""glyphosate detox"" product is a competing interest? Because anyone with a shred of common sense would say so. But you seem to find this charlatan credible.

After WW2, the USA was practically the only world superpower that hadn't experienced warfare within its borders. As a result, our manufacturing and transportation systems made it uniquely profitable to various industries. The economy boomed and created an era of unsustainable wealth.

For white people. 

During the 50's, POC  were still subjugated by redlining and discriminatory laws that exluded them from this boom, both in the north and especially in the south. The US was continuously engaged in coups and destabilization in South America to maximize our interests at the costs of hispanic lives. That's not to mention women's rights issues, as this was pre Roe v. Wade and divorce was more taboo, and the dismal state of LGBT rights back then.

Also note that, athetical to conservative dogma, this boom was when the US had record-high corporate taxes and taxes for the rich, lessening the burden on the low and middle classes.

So for those who personally experienced this time (I'm not one of them), the implicit fact is that the prosperity of that time was limited to heteronormitive European American nuclear families, and was only possible due to systematic subjugation of minority groups.

A non-zero percentage of MAGA people know all of the above and want it anyway, which is impossible without bringing back discriminatory policies or some sort of ethnostatism.

Some of my closest friends are immigrants from several European countries, one owns his own business and the others work in decent jobs and contribute to the economy much more than several people I know who preach your rhetoric. One of my former employers was an immigrant who sold his business for many millions. He came to this country not even knowing the language looking for a better life and managed it with great success. Our problems are more systemic than mere immigration.

Nationalism does nothing more than divide us.

One person I know who hates immigrants is a brick layer and handyman who complains that he is constantly undercut while basically only taking cash in hand jobs and paying virtually no tax.

I lived in and worked in an area with a lot of immigration in the past and the people I met were generous hard working and very pleasant people.

I always wonder how a country such as the USA for example that was built on immigration is now so hostile to it. 

People are the same the world over they just want a better life if not for themselves then for their children. The UK can provide that and they are willing to work hard to do so. 

You could argue it was the right that destroyed the working class cities by destroying manufacturing and moving out over seas. 

I'm a 'moderate' so the left and right hate me equally, there are policies from both sides I would agree with. 

Austerity and the right has done nothing but increase the divide in our society, both economically and socially. 

Why don't we tackle the spiralling cost of housing, the children born into poverty in areas neglected for decades set to repeat the cycle? Why not tackle our crumbling infrastructure? Why not stop the corporations being able to get away with paying virtually no tax while cuts are made everywhere. 

London is one of the most diverse cities on earth with people from all over the world and despite this is also one of the richest. 

From my experience in life so far immigration has done nothing but bring new businesses and people willing to work hard to get ahead for themselves and their kids.

One look at the history of the 20th century tells me nationalism ends in nothing but problems. 

That's my thoughts. Your opinion would hold more water with me if you didn't suggest it with such a condescending and insulting tone. Might I add that a lot of the people I know who also hold your views are particularly unpleasant people because of this.

Most of the smear is based on an interview where he said he experienced/witnessed evil while posing as the godson of a Hungarian official. 

It's more than a stretch to refer to him as a collaborator, it's a disgusting smear. As much as I don't like Soros or the politicians he backs, but by any honest accounting, he would be considered a Holocaust survivor. He was in his early teens and hiding from the Nazis. Had his identity been discovered he would have been murdered along with nearly a half a million other Hungarian Jews.

QAnon &amp; MAGA chuds have said things to me like: ""You participate in confiscation..you are a collaborator""

But he wasn't a participant in the confiscation, he was a kid who was posing as someone's godson who happened to be involved in confiscations. They weren't even in the midst of confiscating the property, as the Arrow Cross already had the estate in question in their possession. The official had to travel to Iregszemcse, 150km outside of Budapest, to itemize the estate. The official was to be gone for three days, so he brought young Soros with him. 

The family whose estate was being inspected had signed over ownership of the estate to the SS in return for their safe passage to Portugal. The owner of the home would eventually relocate to the U.S. and die of natural causes in the late 1960s. But I suppose MAGA conspiracy folk would consider those Jews collaborators, too, seeing as the Nazis benefitted materially from the deal they cut with them.

Soros is one of many billionaire capitalists who uses his money to influence politics,. The reason he is focused on because he is the most high-profile capitalist who happens to throw some money at progressive causes (these are then spun into hysterical fantasies about him directly hiring ANTIFA thugs to interrupt campus appearances by various clickbait propagandists (who then position themselves as freedom of speech warriors, capitalizing on their phony status as 'rebels' or 'resistance').    


That Soros is Jewish helps give credence to the Soros Puppetmaster conspiracy theories (though chuds seem perfectly capable of blocking out Sheldon Adelson, the Mercer family, etc.) as none of the deranged ideas (like those in the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion, etc.) that made their way into the ideology of the NSDAP (or Russian Empire or Henry Ford) ever fully dissipated.   


For years prior to Trump's election RT comments sections were overflowing with frothing with antisemitic conspiracy theories about Angela Merkel being a crypto-Jew or the daughter of Hitler (who, it was claimed, worked for the Jewish cabal) who was working to destroy the fabric of Christian-European society by letting Muslim migrants and refugees in to rape white women (itself an old Nazi trope). Who was behind Merkel in these fantasies but George Soros? The same Soros, it was claimed, that was behind the promotion of ""Cultural Marxism"" (also a Nazi trope, they referred to it as ""Cultural Bolshevism""). As with the Nazi propaganda that claimed that the Jews were the puppetmasters of capitalism AND communism, the billionaire capitalist Soros is projected as a communist (which is conflated with globalism). I don't like Soros either, but the suggestions that billionaire capitalist Soros is promoting left-wing socialism or is a ""literal Nazi"" (the opposite of left-wing or socialist) is patently absurd.  


That the Viktor Orban government has promoted anti-Soros conspiracies is also unsurprising. The nationalists in Hungery aren't exactly honest about their own history. I visited Hungary a few years ago and was shocked by the revisionism that dominated their museums and memorials. There are plenty of Hungarians who are aware of the truth and have erected displays to counter the warped history promoted by officialdom, but they don't hold the levers of power.  


Nationalists like to pretend that they were victims of the Nazis and that they came into the country and killed all the Jews. They will minimize involvement and claim that only a small minority of Hungarians in the fascist Arrow Cross Party helped in the deportation of  440,000 Hungarian Jews in only 55 days between May 1944 and July 1944. This is partly true, but does not alter the fact that Hungarian nationalists helped murder nearly half a million Jews.  


More importantly, they ignore that this was essentially an extension of the policies of the previous conservative nationalist government of Miklos Horthy. The same happened in Vichy France and other nations allied to the Axis powers or occupied by them: they always started with foreign Jews. Also, Horthy passed antisemitic laws long before Hitler came around. He knowingly expelled 18,000 foreign Jews into SS hands for extermination in August 1941, culminating in the Kamianets-Podilskyi Massacre, one of the first mass killings of the Holocaust.

    Server = https://manjaro.moson.eu/arm-stable/$repo/$arch

and that allowed me to update ... once. Because what the dude didn't think through is that there is a known issue with the backwards compat wireless card drivers, so updating led to a dead network card after reboot.

So what I ended up doing was downloading and installing the 20.04 i3 release (that  hadn't known existed when I wrote the original post, because I followed links from the Pine64 pages. 20.04 also has fixed wi-fi driver). Now, I am not a fan of i3 and that hasn't changed. The hurdle here was that the installer either doesn't set screen brightness or does set it but sets it so low that it defaults to 0.2 (ie 20%).  ***So I couldn't see anything on the screen without squinting really hard.*** The way to set it via commnad line is with xrandr, but xrandr can't get the screen name on a Pinebook, so i3 was a useless pile of poo.

i3 has no working slider or icon in the panel for brightness, I had 4 terminal windows open before I even realised the kb command was working. I had to guess type to open a terminal and then guess type install xfce.

With that done and almost able to see enough of the screen to log out, change session to use xfce and log back in, and then use the panel slider to adjust the brightness enough to actually see the screen.

So, I did eventually manage a working xfce  install.

* proofing - i used a heat gun to measure temp in my cold oven - it's about 80-85%. 2 hours in that oven is good for the final prove... with minimal butter melting

That's my problem with Chief in Halo 4, his arc in the game is actively at odds with his depiction in the books. Halo 4 doesn't make Chief like his characterization in the novels, it outright contradicts it. 

The Master Chief, Spartan-IIs in general, have *never* questioned their humanity because nothing about their depictions in the EU ever suggested that the Spartans were at odds with their humanity. In fact it's quite the opposite, Spartan-IIs routinely demonstrate behavior that would support them being fully human. They laugh and make, tease one another, 

The singular time a Spartan-II did question her humanity, it was because she was feeling immense guilt for killing an entire planet. And even then, the fact that she felt guilt at all is evidence enough that she does have humanity, otherwise she wouldn't have felt guilt for essentially committing genocide. 

Before Chief essentially had two characterizations, how he acted in the original trilogy and how he acted in the EU. Post Halo 4 he has *three* main characterizations: how he acts in the original trilogy, how he acts in the EU and how he acts in Halo 4.

Because it's not like anything published after Halo 4 builds towards his characterization in it. Even in media that takes place before Halo 4, where it would make sense to retcon in Chief wrestling with his humanity, Chief is written to be in line with his EU characterization. In fact I'd argue that the post Halo 4 works lean into that aspect of his character a bit more (although that's also because Silent Storm, Collateral Damage and Oblivion are far more focused on the Chief than the Nylund trilogy was).

And even then, I only differentiate the EU and the original trilogy because people view them differently. Unlike Halo 4, the original trilogy and the EU can successfully coexist with one another as valid depictions of the Chief. Unlike Halo 4, the original trilogy, whether it was intended to or not, justifies Chief difference in personality by putting him in situations where the story isn't able to conflict with the EU. We don't get Chief's internal monologue in the games and we don't have other Spartans for him to interact with and those were the two primary ways to showcase Chief's character at the time. There's Johnson, but that was also before Johnson's role as one of Chief's mentors and their 3 decade long history together was ever established.

Both matches were fine margins. While Chelsea should have won, it was mostly a bunch of peno calls that Barcelona got away with. Largely individual errors. 

United had a few problems coming into that final. Rio injury and the bogus fletcher suspension were two big ones. Fergie fucked up his tactics too. He abandoned the midfield battle and went for Park over old Scholes. And Ronaldo absolutely fucked it up in the final. I mean, the posession was equal against a tiki taka Barcelona. United were far better than given credit for. Understandably so. That was Pep's first season and tiki taka was really oppressive. 

If United and Chelsea played in the semis, I actually suspect United would have won. Fergie was always brilliant against English opposition.

I am afraid, there is no way to anticipate, if a revolution is successful or not. It mostly depends on certain factors: How many people have weapons? Are they willing to use them? How desperate are they? How organized are they? Do real mighty people expect to get better along for more money/stability/resources/influence with the old regime or the new one? Is there support from the public opinion? Is there a leader/opponent who is willing to sacrifice everybody? How old (and incrusted) is the system?

If you do decide to pursue a degree in a non-English speaking country, you should absolutely learn the language, but you don‚Äôt need to have it mastered before you move there. If you don‚Äôt already know a language, I‚Äôd recommend you apply only to English degrees. Another thing to keep in mind is what you want to study: there are many Englis-speaking degrees offered for things like business, political science, and STEM, but few for other types of degrees.

Language skills are especially important for admin stuff (getting a visa, finding housing/signing paperwork, getting a bank account), performing day-to-day activities (ie grocery shopping), and making friends. 

The language barrier is certainly something you‚Äôd need to work to overcome, but it‚Äôs definitely not impossible, and friends you make in university will probably be willing to help develop your language skills and help with paperwork etc. The uni I attend offers French up to the C2 level, and people in the English speaking track have to take English their first semester even if they already are fluent in French. 

One thing I recommend you absolutely review about a program or uni before you enroll is research the pedagogic format. The style of learning, assignments expected, and schedule format can all vary widely from university to university and will most likely be very different from an American style. For example, instead of the American thesis-style essay, in France the main essay style is very different and revolves around a central probl√©matique. 

As for after your degree after university, it depends a lot on what you what to do. You can certainly apply to grad schools, there are lots of highly rated universities in the EU for many subjects. If you‚Äôre worried about employment and you don‚Äôt want to get a masters or a PHD, then look into dual degrees. A lot of times, you‚Äôll get reduced tuition for half of your degree, but you‚Äôll still have an American degree to show to employers. Look into dual ba degrees if you‚Äôre worried about employment in the US (not an unwarranted concern, people in the US know Oxbridge in Europe and that‚Äôs usually it). 

Finally, you have to consider what it will logistically mean to be going to university in Europe. You‚Äôll miss Thanksgiving. Your winter/spring breaks won‚Äôt align with your American friends. You probably will only fly back over the winter break, so you‚Äôll go for months without seeing people back home. Can you deal with that?   
European universities also have a much more hands-off approach to student life, so clubs will be student run, most student activities will probably include (legal, often heavy) drinking, and you‚Äôll have to find housing for yourself and cook for yourself. Also, it will definitely be more difficult to find mental health support if you do struggle with academics or living in a foreign country. 

Emotionally, you need to be more mature than your American-university-attending peers, ready to be intrinsically motivated, and confident in your self-reliance. I have loved attending uni in France, it has challenged me immeasurably and now I‚Äòm more self reliant than my friends who have gone to American schools.

Fait : Nous sommes en r√©cession (2 trimestres √† la suite o√π le PIB baisse).  
Cons√©quences :   


* Impact sur l'emploi &amp; donc sur les recettes fiscales
* C√¥t√© business, changement  probable de dogme √† venir : tentatives de relocalisation, de  d√©mondialisation. r√©duction des couts &amp; profits ne seront plus les priorit√©s, d'o√π un impact sur la rentabilit√© des actions (dividendes), et donc sur leurs prix. 
* La dette des √©tats, d√©j√† tr√®s endett√©s va exploser (c'est en cours). l'aust√©rit√© n'est pas une option cette fois-ci. l'autre option, c'est de mon√©tiser la dette (= cr√©ation de monnaie par la BCE pour financer les √©tats). 
* D√©flation ou stagnation sauf inflation cibl√©e sur les produits tr√®s demand√©s dans les prochains moins. Pour les autres produits, les prix n'augmentent pas, et donc le revenu des salari√©s &amp; actionnaires non plus. 
* Beaucoup d'entreprises vont faire faillite du fait du choc de demande n√©gatif d√©j√† en cours --&gt; ch√¥mage. Il va y avoir des d√©fauts de cr√©dit en masse chez les particuliers et chez les entreprises (dangereux du fait de la propagation dans les r√©seaux fournisseur - clients)
* Il y aura un choix politique √† faire entre le nombre d'entreprises qu'on laisse faire faillite &amp; l'intensit√© de l'inflation (si l'on distribue trop d'argent)
* Les assureurs sont en danger (ils √©mettent les swaps, des produits d√©riv√©s qui permettent de se couvrir contre le risque), en cas de faillite, les banques sont en danger car les instruments de couverture qu'ils ach√®tent aux assureurs ne marchent alors plus. Il faut savoir que la France a les plus grosses banques d'Europe, elles repr√©sentent une grosse part de son √©conomie
* La bulle de l'immobilier risque d'√©clater, car les taux vont augmenter pour compenser le co√ªt du risque et les conditions se durcir dans un contexte difficile
* En r√©sum√©, on revient dans un contexte √† risque pour quelques ann√©es avec de la volatilit√© :)

A hundred were now watching, this had caught the attention of even the busy drivers in rush hour. Their faces in anticipation, some were even scared. Others were complaining that this isn't the real deal.

""MINECRAFT...""

But they all suddenly started cheering, shaking, praying. When they heard my tone, my pitch, my timbre.... they all knew what was going to come next. They realized... that salvation of the human race has finally come.

""Minecraft good Fortnite bad""

And then the silence broke

""OOOIOIIUUUUUGHHHhJJHHHHHWAASEAAAa//::""

Thousands of people fell to their knees, yelling orgasmically. People starting crying tears of joy, others were running and thanking God, News reporters were already on the scene, broadcasting the entire thing nationwide and consequently the entire world. Hundreds of people came out of their cars, buses, taxis, stores, and subway stations hooting and hollering. It was a miracle unfolding.

I started to say the next sentence relayed to me by our Lord and Savior.

""M-m-mi... Mine...""

Already some people fainted at just the mere sound of my voice. Even more people came. Some were jumping from planes thousands of feet in the air, others ran or swam miles to here in mere seconds. I think I even spotted a few famous people.

""MINE...""

Nearly a million people were here now. There's now Europeans, Canadians, Mexicans, Latin Americans, West Coasters, Africans, and even several Asians and one Australian. They were screaming hysterically, bringing gifts for me, taking pictures and videos. Fireworks and confetti everywhere, helicopters, and even Donald Trump was here with his family bowing down to me.

""MINEC-C-C-CRAFT voice crack""

A billion people were here now. Even animals from all over the world were coming in herds. I could see Pewdiepie \&amp;amp;amp;amp; Martiza, Elon Musk, Keanu Reeves, Lil Nas X, 50 Cent, Oprah Winfrey, the Kardashians, and so many other people. Many people were having seizures, heart attacks, and strokes from the sheer excitement, and some were being trampled to death because of the huge crowd. The screaming was deafening. Some just came straight out of their bathroom, school, work, or their parenting... but it doesn't matter now.

""MMMMMMIIIIINNNNEEECRAAAFTTTTT""

No matter what was your race, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, religion, economic class, etc... it didn't matter. All of humanity has come together for this one moment. Millions of people have died to due plane crashes, car crashes, doctors abandoning their patients, parents abandoning their children... just to be here, but it will all be worth it.

Nearly half of humanity is here now. Even the dead came out their graves for this. Everyone is climbing on top of each other and on the walls of skyscrapers since they couldn't fit. So many lights, music, dancing, feasts... yet barely a minute passed. Humanity is very interesting.

10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

I look at the smiling faces of the crowd in front of me. I look at the death and destruction that came from sacrifice to attend this event. This is it. We're ready.

Billions of people around the world disintegrated into their pure chemical compounds that composed their bodies, then their atoms, then their protons/neutrons/electrons, and finally their quarks... as they heard that holy sentence. The distant echoes of yelling can heard from thousands of miles. This... this was their ultimate purpose in life. This is the culmination of everything that has happened in human history, it is reason why life even existed in the first place. They weren't screaming in terror, they were shouting in orgasmic joy. They could finally die happy. Their entire lives flashed before their eyes as they saw their loved ones. They saw their ultimate fantasy. They can finally be freed from their imperfect bodies in this imperfect world.

The Sun blinked out. The Moon crashed into the Earth. The Earth turned into dust. The Solar System collapsed into a state of entropy. The Milky Way hosts a firework show of supernovas. All the galaxies of the universe colliding with one another. Reality is falling apart. That's because reality doesn't need to exist anymore. It has reached its goal. Spacetime has fallen. Matter ceases to exist. Not even the concept of nothing exists. The universe was never born.

Humanity is gone. Everything is gone. We are now one. Evil doesn't exist anymore. Insecurities don't exist anymore. Fear, sadness, anger don't exist anymore. Just hope, love, and harmony for eternity. This is what we were meant to be. This is our final evolution stage.

This is heaven. This is what it means to be happy.

This is why ships like Alabama and Kidd have the same camo. It's simply a representation of what was used at the time (in this case, Measure 22).

Bernie's policies are considered solidly left wing in Europe; I have no idea where Bernie's policies are considered anything else. Maybe in Venezuela, his policies might be ""centrist"" or in the failing economies of Spain, France and Italy they might be only ""centre-left"". The better an economy gets, the more 'left wing"" his policies become, I'm sure you might have observed this. **Policies should never be made in favor of renters, but home owners**, which is what the US prides itself on. **US has 73.5% white home ownership rate, and a 67% overall home ownership rate, higher than any Western European country and most American homes are actual houses, not apartments; most countries in the EU have a sub 5% home ownership rate if you only count detached housing and non leaseholds. Almost all apartments are leaseholds and have a 100-year lifespan before they get knocked down. Moreover,** the US should seek to increase that to over 80-90%. Home ownership builds wealth and prevents state dependency while ensuring economic productivity. Even Biden's ""housing policy"" is in realizing how retarded rent control is. It is an abjectly selfish policy to push for rent control and it goes against the common good of the middle class and upper class. Rent control ONLY assists the least productive members of society and harms everyone else. Rent control, in a hilarious enough way, is seen as one of the worst forms of economic rent seeking. **Most economists agree on this, it's a consensus issue:** [**rent control is retarded**](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/09/19/rent-control-will-make-housing-shortages-worse)**.** 
2. Depends what you consider ""acceptable living"". [**Most Poor Americans actually live lives identical to middle class Europeans**](https://fee.org/articles/the-poorest-20-of-americans-are-richer-than-most-nations-of-europe/)**;** **living in a project with medicaid in an ""inner city"" is exactly how Europeans live.** The INEQUALITY and effort put into said life is more in the US, maybe. But the lifestyle exactly is identical. Its just that America is more inequal, and people are naturally envious. **Poor Americans are JEALOUS, to put it simply, because the rich in America own houses and Teslas and the super rich own private jets and yachts.** In Europe, the poor European will get to live in a rent controlled apartment in the city center of Berlin with the same rent, forever, will be materially actually slightly poorer than the equal American, but the rich European will be regulated and taxed into being forced to live in an apartment as well, just to pay rents and live only marginally better in a similar location. Meanwhile the poor American will live in an irrelevant city making slightly more money and paying much less rent, while the rich American can afford to own an apartment in Manhattan.
3. Since you're here in Munich too, why don't you stop lying to everyone here and explain the fact it takes 1 hour to get from a place like Mittersendling to Olympiazentrum, minimum. Especially given the walking time to U-Bahn stations, and the switch ups necessary to go from U-6 to U-3 and so on? Or the fact that people here who can afford to, still buy a BMW so they dont waste 1 hour taking third world tier transport to go 10-15km? Also you're wrong, the US has comprehensive bus public transit by law covering nearly every 1 square mile of space in urban areas. I lived there, I know. Its just that literally ZERO Americans would tolerate taking 1 hour to go 10km. While people here happily do. The reason you'd make barely anything is German costs of living and car costs, in the US car costs are extremely low. Blame the ""green new deal"" for this. I worked as a software engineer in the US, I was making $100k net. Here I work as a SWE, I make $52k gross, roughly. Im making $33k net. And post rent I save $200 a month. In the US I was saving about $5500 a month. Let that sink in. Isarcard here is $60 for within the M-Zone, but I live outside the M-Zone and it costs $150 a month. $1800 a month on a fucking train that takes forever. In the US I was spending roughly $250 a month including gas and insurance. So I was spending $100 more monthly for a car I actually owned and convenience I had 100x more and I could go ANYWHERE with no limits. 
4. **Germany has UBI it is Hartz IV ALG II, anyone can be a NEET and live at home and shop for for for 200 euro a week**, have rent covered for a studio apartment and play video games all day and get paid for it by the German government because **you get statutory 432 + rent + heating** without preconditions. If you strategize with a girlfriend and get a union it doubles the sum. This is the problem, these shitty programs take up so much money that is the reason our tax system is so high. Pensions are already high due to the retiring boomers and they add in these dumb welfare programs. **It's not a BIT LESS for middle class, stop lying, look at the graph its THIRTY PERCENT**, that is the amount spent on housing. **THIRTY PERCENT IS HUGE. That is the difference between Italy and Poland in avg incomes**.  "" you are right people in higher income stratas in europe will probably pay more in taxes than in the states "" [In the US THIRTY PERCENT of the households earns more than $100k a year](https://www.census.gov/content/census/en/library/publications/2018/demo/p60-263.html), in Germany its THREE PERCENT.  Literally 80-90% of society is worse off here and I find it extremely irritating that Germans here are blind to how worse off they are. **You think renting an apartment, paying your landlord, and never being able to own anything is ""good"" lifestyle?** **It's the lifestyle of a slave**, except you are enslaved here to both the unproductive rent seeking poor and the unproductive government socialists.  "" give up on owning the newest porsche for last years model "" **Again stop fucking lying, jesus. Why do people here always do this? Its not a porsche, most people here cant even own their own fucking house or a 100m2 apartment, let alone a car. Most Germans have no savings, and you are fine with this so ""NEETs"" can do nothing and play video games all day? I am not, I am going to leave to Switzerland in 3 months, have fun as this shitty system collapses.

&gt; There was no production of jeans in the Soviet Union, but like all their peers abroad, Soviet youth wore jeans. The price was 180‚Äì250 rubles for a pair depending on the brand, which was almost twice as much as the monthly wage of an entry-level engineer. A visiting nurse charged 1 ruble for one injection if a patient lived below the fifth floor. The price reached 1.5 rubles for patients who lived on the fifth floor and up. A plumber happily repaired a faucet for just a bottle of vodka.

This wasn't a magic scenario where a plumber just barters away vodka for a service or good. Again, this is exactly how bartering looked under feudalism too--the important thing to note is that these transactions actually **required** the existence of money, which all the items kind of refer to for their value. Feudal peasants in Europe still used the old Roman Empire currency system if and when they bartered (as in, ""this thing is worth **BLAH** amount of Roman silver coins, your thing is worth **BLAH** amount of Roman silver coins"") it was usually in reference to the money system.

Like, we know for a fact that the amount of coins that circulated in feudal Europe was WAAAAAAAAAY below the amount of wealth that actually circulated in the economies of Europe at the time. We also know for a fact that peasants would rarely if ever actually **use** coin--but they still depended on it heavily, because it aided referencing value in other situations, such as bartering.

Similarly, your scenario is that in the USSR there was WAAAAY less of actual concrete money than the transactions actually circulating would suggest.

The campaign map is larger. Way larger. There is both more detail and regions than can be found in Vanilla M2:TW, in addition to having the game map expanded eastward past the Caucusus and the Caspian Sea. The eastern edge of the map is therefore deeper into Russia, and includes a large chunk of Persia. Further south includes almost all of the Arabian peninsula. The Aztecs and the Americas have been removed.

-There are new factions. Aragon, Genoa (replaces Milan), Norway, the Teutonic Order*, the Kievan Rus, the Cumans, the Crusader States, and Khwarezmia, and two starting times of the Campaign: 1100 or 1220. *Teutons are only in the late start game.

-You can play as the Mongols if you choose the option of a Late start campaign.

-More diverse and historical unit rosters. Many units have been retextured and some entirely new. This is especially true for the Eastern European factions. Some units from the Kingdoms expansion have been included.

-Heavy cavalry got buffed to be even more devastating in a charge. Knights are nasty but a limited resource because:

-""Real Recruitment"" is one of the submods that is on by default. This makes the unit pool replenish much slower, especially for elite units. Certain units can only be recruited in certain regions, and higher tech units cannot be recruited until certain dates throughout the game. So even if you somehow have a maxed out citadel with every building in 1200, you can't build a 16th century pike army with plate armor. This is my favorite of the smaller features.

-Time rate per turn is switched to a slower pace (I believe it is a year/turn). The game also ends way later in the early 1600s. Therefore the Campaign is much longer. I have yet to progress even close to that.

-Population growth is much slower and high taxes can be devastating to the long term success of your regions.

-""Army Resupply System"" is another submod included by default. I personally play with this feature off as I found it to be buggy/unpolished but I may give it another shot in the near future as this was a couple releases ago that I last played it.

-Agents seem to be buffed a bit, especially princesses, in the sense that they start with higher experience than in Vanilla. Enemy generals will actually want to marry into your family.

-A ton of new character traits and retinues are added. In addition ""Titles"" from M1:TW have been added to the game as a part of this increase. For example if you move a general to Bordeaux the next turn or so he will receive the title of ""Duke of Aquitaine,"" given that he doesn't already have a title and another character doesn't also already have that specific title.

-Forts are small castles

-Gates spew out burning oil like in R:TW and Kingdoms.

-Regions actually have names instead of just the city like they did in R:TW.

-Campaign AI. You have an option to choose from 3 AI submods, each one differing mostly in aggression level. I play with the moderate one and the CAI seems much better.

-Battle AI seems slightly better. I have actually lost to the AI in battles I should have won by underestimating them. But don't get too excited; it's still a TW game.

-Pathfinding is still utter shit in sieges.

It is completely fine to go from one perfect interval (the unison here) into another perfect interval (the P5) and again into the octave. However, this is only allowed if the motion is contrary motion. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. Now, in 2-voice counterpoint, the harmonic interval of a P4 is not acceptable, since it is not a very nice harmony (melodically it is excellent, and actually the strongest melodic leap we have in classical Western European music). Now in this case, the unison moves into the P4, by contrary motion, however, the P4 immediately goes into the P5. So the P4 is 'in passing'. Whenever we deal with dissonances, we use them in passing. Yes it is on the downbeat, however, our ears hear this pass onto the P5 (you may have dissonance on or off the beat). Then into the octave, again, in contrary motion which is perfectly fine. 

I hope this sheds some light on the situation. I may create a video specifically on this topic, and a few more rules and details regarding 2, 3 or 4 voice counterpoint, motion, and context in regard to dissonances in passing.

&gt;Secondly, would you compare life expectancy between a poor and rich country ? Stop coping and compare what's comparable. Anyway, even if whites have more T than most of other ethnic groups, they certainly don't beat blacks in this field.

Oh now it's the comparison that's getting in the way of your argument. Lmao stop swollowing words.

&gt;Blacks have higher T than any other ethnic group. People are ready to say black females are too masculine, yet they contest the fact black men are the most masculine. JFL... the cope is insane...

It might have something to do with their bone structure but honestly at this point trying to reason with a person who tries to use the fact that some mamals with darker fur have a slightly higher % of T in their blood as proof that T and skin pigmentation are correlated is almost as retarded as you.

&gt;You're completely deluded. I can say genetics have no impact on height since you can be short with poor nutrition

false equivalence. Btw race has almost zero impact on testostorone. 

&gt;With or without adjustment for covariates, there were no significant differences in testosterone, bioavailable testosterone, or SHBG levels by race/ethnicity.¬†

The meeting was attended by the Ministers of State H.S.Puri and Som Parkash, Secretaries of the Department of Commerce, and Pharmaceuticals, and Officers from Departments of Commerce, Pharmaceuticals and Health.
During his interaction, Goyal lauded the pharma industry for making India proud, by rising to the occasion during the Covid crisis.¬†
He said that India has been recognized as the ‚ÄòPharmacy of the World‚Äô, as over 120 countries got some essential medicines, during the last two months, including 40 of them getting them in the form of grant, free of cost.¬†
He said that during the crisis, the officials of DGFT, MEA, Health and DoP burnt midnight oil to ensure that the export consignments are delivered at the earliest.¬†
The whole world appreciated India‚Äôs gesture, and this has swelled India‚Äôs goodwill and reputation.¬†
He said that India had adequate production capacity and abundant stock of HCQ and PCM for its projected domestic requirements, and putting restrictions on their exports was to ensure that the medicines are made available to all the needy nations, and no unscrupulous element stocks them for unwarranted gains.
The Pharma industry received accolades from the Minister for their extra-ordinary performance, in ensuring that the Country did not face any type of shortage of medicines during this period. ¬†
Goyal said that early announcement of the Lockdown helped the country in preventing and containing the scourge of pandemic, and also scaling up the health infrastructure and build capacity, besides generating awareness among the people about the precautions and preventive measures.¬†
He said that India has set an example, under the able guidance and leadership of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in being pro-active in management of Covid-19, and also following it up with welfare and relief packages for mitigating its consequences.
Goyal assured the industry that the Government will fully support the industry in its expansion, diversification and strengthening.¬†
He said that the industry has an important role to play in the Aatamnirbhar Bharat campaign. The country should become Aatmanirbhar in APIs as early as possible, as the government has taken a number of steps in this regard.¬†
It has already approved the scheme on Promotion of Bulk Drug Parks for financing Common Infrastructure Facilities in 3 Bulk Drug Parks.¬†
Also, Production Linked Incentive Scheme for promotion of domestic manufacturing of critical KSMs/Drug Intermediates and APIs in the country has been given a go ahead.
The Minister said that anti-dumping investigation process has been expedited. The Minister said that in case of ongoing bilateral FTAs, if any roadblock or unfair competition is being noticed, the Government may be informed and prompt remedial action will be taken. He said they should look at large untapped market in Eastern Europe and Russia.¬†
Calling upon a collaborative route in the R&amp;D efforts, Goyal said the Academicians, Universities, ICMR and private sector should join hands.¬†
Informing the gathering that the Government has decided to disinvest in certain Pharma PSUs, the Minister invited the Indian companies to use PSUs for plug and play model of manufacturing.¬†
The Minister assured the industry that all suggestions presented in the meeting will be quickly examined and wherever required, the inter-ministerial consultations will be completed at the earliest.

Let's analyse Japan: 

bare bones history: they were always isolated from the world and didn't take immigrants. No immigration means no culture mixing, no culture mixing means no slave trade with Europe in medieval times. The Japanese were so fascinated with the first black man to step on the island that they though his skin was purely tattoed (look up the Black Samurai, it's really cool if maybe a bit fictional). They opened up after the US invasion and, well... Bombing. So their culture has had about 70 years to get accustomed to black people not just existing somewhere in the vast world, but actually living in their country.

Then we must remember, they were Americanised, and racism stopped being funny to Americans in the 60s, so the Japanese had around 20 years of American media portraying blackface and stereotypes as their practically only contact with African Americans. We go all the way to the 80s and the first rise of anime, and we fist see real interest in immigration to Japan. So without being too exaggerated, it's only been 40 years since Japan has needed to socially accept black people.

It's a bizarre world. And it's not a pretty story.

1. The first one is from genealogical perspective. I think the correct term would be Astronesian. A more crude definition is the brown people in Nusantara. I believe this concept was popularised by the early European. 
2. Second one is from nationalist perspective. This is defined as those who practice Malay culture and Muslim. This is a shitty definition because the term Malay here is recursive. Most people would attribute Malay culture here as in Johore Malay culture aka Srivijayan culture. People tends to forget Langkasukan or the old Malay culture which originates from north part of peninsular. This eventually leads to common phrase MalAy CaMe FroM InDoNesia (which is partly true).

When people said Philippines are Malay they are referring to term 1.

Same goes to Orang Asli are Malay. What they meant is both Malay and orang Asli are from Astronesian root. (This is not completely correct though because Negritos are not considered as Astronesian).

Here is my shitty analogy. 

Imagine Malaysia as a country, break apart. Sabah and Sarawak become independent. For a few hundred years, people in each state intermarry and create a mixed culture. Dominant language overpower less popular sub-ethic language. Later on, Sabah and Sarawak decided to join Brunei and Kalimantan to form a new country, Bornesia.

They create a new language called Borney which a mix of English (because it's the world standard), Malay (because some of them were parts of Malaysia) , Chinese and local words. 

After another few hundred years..

a) Some will claim that Bornesian came from Peninsular, because Borney sounds like Malay and they eat nasi lemak just like Peninsular people.

He was happy with it, and off he went... only to come back about two hours later as the power supply didn't fit. He seemed legit as he didn't want a refund and wanted to keep the console.

This is copied from a previous comment I've written:

A few countries I like to visit frequently though:

* Portugal: A really wonderful country with good beaches and nature. Highly developed yet affordable. It gets a bit frustrating to stay in after a while so I keep my trips to only a few months.

* Georgia: Very affordable, good government, efficient businesses. Can be a bit frustrating to work with Georgian people due to the culture difference (Georgians are not known for being hard workers). I actually prefer working with Armenians; on occasion I work with a law firm in Armenia and have an assistant in Georgia. I don't like spending too much time in Georgia since culturally it's not the best fit for me, but a few weeks a year to do business works well.

* Turkey: Wonderful culture, terrible government. The internet is awful so it's not a good place to do work. I keep trips to only a few days as a result.

* Mexico: Amazing food. Possibly some of the best food in the world. This is reason enough to stay long term in Mexico. It's not without its faults, but I can stay long periods (e.g. 6 months) of time in Mexico and still enjoy it.

* Serbia: This is one of my favorite countries. I'm not sure if I can exactly pinpoint why I like it so much. Maybe it's I just fit in culturally with the people.

How to turn Vampires Human Again:

&amp;#x200B;

**The Graft:**

Some Verbena have a process called ""the Graft"" to reverse undeath for a full turn of the seasons. This spell rebinds the undead back into the flow of life and the bright side of the goddess. It is a fickle spell, though, and sensitivity of the witch greatly affects how long the graft lasts before the hunger arises and darkness reasserts itself.  In order to graft a vampire, the mage needs to bind a living ""root"" for the creature, a second pattern to serve as host and channel to the flow of life. In the few successful attempts either an particularly large and ancient tree or a willing human volunteer were used as a tap through which the vampires pattern could drink from the natural cycle of life.  As long as the spell lasts, the root organism has its force and vitality shared with the vampire. It craves for a large amound food and sleep and his health is more fragile for sustaining his partner. During spring, the root suffers very little, but as seasons progress, passing summer and autum, the drain becomes severe and by the first snowfall, the connection tends to be abruptly severed with risk of death if it for some reason lingers.  During the whole proccess, though, the vampire is restored to a perfect human state. It's health dwindles a little during the year, though. In the dark nights of winter, though, the curse reasserts itself with unmatched intesity, the beasts craving to take the blood it was dennied during the rest of the year feels the thirst of the goddess herself reaping the world if cold and darkness.  Old tales instruct witches to lock down the undead in thse periods, starving them into torpor under the roots of their trees or the house of their hosts until spring provides not only the blood but also strenght for a new root to be reatached.

A master in life with the right amount of study and reasearch is able to properly graft a vampire for a whole year, but desperate or daring disciples and initiates have been able to accomplish weaker versions of the rite hat last for a lunar month or even a single day. One thing in common in all version of the rite, though, is that a lingering bound is created between root and graft, and if one is hurt before the other is surely to feel the waves. In a particularly terrible account of this spell, the reborn graft was killed in an accident and the root later on inherited the curse of caine as soon as the moon shone later that year in the first winter night.

&amp;#x200B;

**Baptism of  Flames**

A saint of the chorus  is attributed to have performed this miracle in medieval europe. To rebaptize a pious cainite who truly craved redemption.  A dangerous rite and a proof of faith, this cerimony must be is performed at the cusp of dawn. The cainite must bath in the sacred waters of a holy place, and allow the heavenly nectar inside his body through the transmogrification of the blood of christ in the substance of holy wine. If the cainite can fully face the sun with the wine firmly kept in his gut, the flames that erupt from his skin will be soothed just enough the curse of caine will be consumed but his raw black flesh will slowly heal as a mortal in the months and years that follow.

Hermetics that witnessed the rite theorize that a prodigial amount of vis is being suffused in the pattern of the vampire, reinforcing and protecting whatever is left of the mortal fiber while the mystical underpinnings of the curse are allowed to burst in full exposure to the solar emanation.

**Transmigration of the Soul**

A modern thanatoic solution to the unbalance state of undeath. The transmigration of the soul allow a vampire spirit to be severed from his undead form and replaced in the body of a mortal. Although simple in design, this arbitration leaves a lot of very difficult karmic strands to be unknotted by the former vampire.  The curse of undeath is manifested in the cravings and hungers of the beast and the more a soul ressonates with those base desires, the stronger the chains that binds it to them. The transmigration is a second chance at life, the first step in a long journey of attoning for the debts and vices that chain man and beast. Only when the newly reincarnated individual has surpassed his previous flaws and repaid the debt of blood and violence, he is truly and finally freed from his connection.

During the transmigration, two being exist. A savage mindless monster that stalks the night and carries fleeting memories of his previous existence and a indebted soul that walks the living world in a borrowed mortal body.  Fate binds these two creatures as their paths will cross over and over again until the former vampire pay all his debts and grows into a more enlightened individual. To destroy the undead monster only frees the immaterial beast to try to merge with the transmigrated soul once again, and the borrowed body must come from a being that genuinely lost its grip on life and its will to live.

&amp;#x200B;

**Experimental Hemoetherical Transfusional Dialysis**

This whole design is based on the observation that the vampiric condition seems tied to a proccess in which antropossential animal aether is removed from the afflicted and is substituted through a infusion of mutagenic hemophagic essence.  The EHTD is vicious theoretical machine that extracts residual antropossential aether from the vampire sire (vector) and reconstitutes a near human-serum that can be injected as a supplement for the vampire child. A few minutes after the supplement is injected, most of the symptoms of vampirisms subsumes becoming more manageable mild version of allergies, irritability and photosensibility.

the injections are produced at great cost for the donor, though, as it is a excruciating and   exhausting process that, in time, end up aggravating his own vampiric affliction. The higher the serum concentration, the longer the effects last but the more it drains the sire. which leads to depletion and weakening of subsequent extractions.

While the current treatment is not definitive, further research seems to point that a complete rescontitutive serum can be achieved by making incremental compounds using older vampires of a given lineage . Thus, a theoretical fully humanizing extract can be developed for an individual after collecting and reconstituting the human essences of three to four generations of previous vectors. At this time, the further a Scientist has come from testing this hypothesis is to use extracted samples of older vampires to refine a intermediate serum to strenghten and recover the vivacity of a deepleted vampiric donor.",True,False,False,,,0,1591039621,,1591040686,0,{},fsk1o86,False,t3_gunp45,False,False,t3_gunp45,/r/WhiteWolfRPG/comments/gunp45/become_human_again/fsk1o86/,False,,1596968359,10,True,False,WhiteWolfRPG,t5_2u6fa,r/WhiteWolfRPG,public,,0,[],

Nothing you've posted indicates the media orgs were being mislabeled due to a particular narrative.

&gt;it is, in fact, a slippery slope.

Again, logical fallacy. I'm not sure why you keep admitting your argument is baseless without the assumption that it will lead to greater levels of restriction. Since this is the only example and it was resolved in 2018, that suggests the ""slippery slope"" never occurred.

&gt;You also point out that there were probably media that had the same narrative, but that they were not labeled. That is incorrect.

Doesnt matter if research studies are included. The validity of it means nothing. I'm instantly racist. Rather than have open conversations about issues that no one wants to even contemplate are possible, these subjects just get tossed to the side.

I can't imagine why. 


&gt;I'm not sure I support the lack of nutrition hypothesis. It goes against some other thoughts I have.

&gt;Humans aren't immune from evolution within the species. Blacks adapted to hotter temperatures by producing increased melanin in their skin to prevent sunburn. Asians developed slanted eyes because they adapted to more direct sunlight at higher altitudes.

&gt;Certain African cultures cannot see certain colors because they dont have words for them. Blue is a big one. To them, the sky is black. That's how they actually see the sky, too. However, they have multiple words for green and can see hues of green traditional Europeans cannot see.

&gt;So what does this all mean? Well, why is IQ off the table for evolutionary purposes? 

I simply cannot fathom why nobody is giving you the benefit of the doubt, here. 

^(Also, no, that's not how human biology works, lol.)



&gt;He's not saying its their fault. He's saying it's their responsibility.

&gt;The Jews were largely put at fault because the Germans couldn't rely on any financial institutions to turn their economy around. You forget that the Allies have as much blame as Hitler in starting WWII. The Allies fucked over the German's economy, forced them to pay for ALL of WWI, and global financial institutions chiefly controlled by Jews refused to give Germany a loan. Turns out the holocaust was completely avoidable.

&gt;You also forget that neither the north or south gave a shit about slave rights. By the end of the civil war, there were more slaves than non slaves. The north feared a government overthrow and they didnt have the resources to support the slaves. To make matters worse, the slaves were too uneducated to work in the north's predominant manufacturing industries.

&gt;It was never about the rights of slaves. It was about the economy.

&gt;And yes, as fucked up as these situations were, if the demographic of choice proved their value to the aggressors, this shit never would have happened.

I'm quite excited by your suggestions on a personal level, they fit quite perfectly with my views.

I would suggest that, for the sake of making it better for everyone, both countries could adopt ""Euro-English"" as their primary language with German and French still official as well; and have all three be taught since pre-school. 

Luxembourg does that (with Luxembourgish + DE + FR, but also with English) before 10 years old, and it works *wonders*, they are polyglots by excellence).

The reason I'm bringing Euroenglish into the mix is that, if you're gonna teach a second language early on, it might as well be ""the best"" overall, in this case both internationally and as far as other members of a European Federation would fit too. And I particularly like the idea that it would forge a ""new"" culture so to speak at the same time both for Germans and the French, that's binding generations together (youth having shared the same experience).

&gt; TV like ARTE

Yes, please, where do I sign. I want that yesterday :(

I've long admired the BBC for the historical quality of its programs (e.g. documentaries featuring, in writing, actual PhDs breaking new grounds: how refreshing compared to most basic ""TV"" production). And ARTE is truly a worthy comparison to make, it sits up there with the giants. I think such cultural cornerstones are, in retrospect, instrumental in building both intelligent and lasting cultures. They need to adapt to the times and push to TikTok all the way back from TV, though, passing by the Tubes and whatnot. *If your 15 years old doesn't know it, it doesn't exist as far as the future is concerned (haha, j/k, but you get the idea).*

Agreed on constitutional difficulties in finding a good enough common regime at a Federal level; it is in my opinion the biggest cultural gap between France and Germany: the political culture of institutions. The gist of it is a centralized versus federalized culture, and you might well be looking at two of the most dramatically opposed countries on that spectrum within the EU. I mean, there's Switzerland beyond Germany; and maybe small states are more centralized than France... but at that scale?

I very much fear the clash of cultures, and I'm hard at work trying to research/think political systems that allow both mechanisms (extreme forms of decentralization, extreme forms of concentration) to coexist and even feed each other nicely, synergistically.

In what other manner of freedoms? Like to bear arms? How about to elect every single member of our representative body? There are no monarchies here. As for happiness - that's entirely subjective. I would not be happy in Norway. The culture is too different and Europeans tend to be a bit stuck up apart from the Brits (if you subscribe to the idea they're European...I'm not even sure if they all agree on that point).
2. Why would we need to? There's nothing to be gained with Norway. Further evidence of how meh your nation is, geopolitically speaking.
3. I don't either. I have a job and insurance. I do agree changes need to be made in our healthcare, but the simple fact is that not all Americans are in the ""bankruptcy"" bubble of insurance. Many of us are not because we have careers with well paying and well benefitted job. Not to say we cannot improve the situation for those who are not so fortunate. And as far as safety: you can be stabbed. You can be beaten. Yes we have gangs and violence.
4. Of the top 10 pharmaceutical companies the US itself has 4 and it has the #1 and the #4 by revenue.

Hitler (like many like him elsewhere) was a populist demagogue who tapped into the racism already rampant in German society at the time. And that was far from only prevalent in Germany - see the pogroms all over eastern Europe that triggered large immigration waves of Jews to America in the late 19th &amp; early 20th century. 

I remember talking in Berlin to a German Jew who lived in western Germany in the 70s and he was saying how it was totally normal to hear ""mild"" anti-Semitic comments all the time when he was a kid at school &amp; that it's much rarer today. His teacher apparently put him as an example in-front of the class to show the other pupils some thing about ""typical Jewish traits"". When I myself was a student at the TU Wien in the early 00s I remember an older professor talking about ""how Muslims are"" (there were students with headscarves in the class looking very uncomfortable as he said that) - this was already walking on thin ice back then but I'm pretty sure it would get him into deeper shit today.

Look at how Sinti and Roma are treated (and have been treated) all over Europe. Ask any German of Turkish decent whose parents came to Germany or Austria as Gastarbeiter in the 60s or 70s what it was like at the time to be Turkish in these countries. Ask any Black person who has been here for a long time what it was like to be Black in western Germany 10-20-30 years ago compared to now (not that it's great now). Heck Milo≈°eviƒá was in power in the 90s, so during the time the photographed people's parents' were roughly their age today - and that wasn't in Germany.

If you are ""white"" it is easy to think there was no or not much racism but it is much more likely that it was simply invisible to you as you were not the target. And also naturally when there were fewer visible immigrants racism was less of a media topic, doesn't mean they didn't experience it - rather that you didn't hear of it.

And more to your point - why mention they are white? Because the current protests are against police brutality against Black people (one of many manifestations of the common problem of white on black racism - more pressing in America for historical and demographic reasons but it's not a purely American problem).

&gt;I think that this question of our identity is the Canadian Identity

I believe you are correct in this statement, but that is where I believe perhaps the identity problems arise in Canada. We are stuck in this paradox like situation of both possessing and not possessing a sense of identity. 

&gt; we measure to the low bar of the US and pretend like we're different even though we're very similar. 

Hit the nail on the head there. We have some sort of superiority complex with regards to the States. It seems as though we see how the world reacts to the States, and then we make reactionary moves for better optics, but simultaneously ignoring things within our own society that need to be addressed. That is why I am frustrated with the protests right now. It took and American death from American hands for Canadians to march in the streets, but meanwhile Canadian indigenous get racially profiled and have police brutality conducted against them and we ignore it, which you pointed out.

&gt;  similar policing issues, weather that's indegenous or people of colour being targeted or the fact that the police are somewhat of an occupying force. 

I have been to The Northwest Territories and it is bad. Every RCMP car that passed got flipped off by the indigenous kids I was with. Canadians are happy to be activists for American problems because it is popular online, but ignore real issues that need to be addressed in this country.  

&gt;  ""I like to say we're like siblings with the US, but we're the younger more chill one that the parents tried hard to not screw up after the older brother got edgy and revolted. ""  
&gt;  
&gt;"" Our identity now is still routed in European traditions, but the cultural gravity of the US also pulls us in. We are aware of that and try to distinguish ourselves as not American and this is where I think we stand out.  ""

This is where I disagree, because I don't believe that this can be a national identity (if that is what you were trying to say). I'd argue that if we are reliant on another nation with a more well defined identity to form our own identity, then we do not have one of our own. If we do have one based on that, it is not very a strong identity. I love my country of Canada, but I always struggle with what it means to be Canadian. ""Politeness, acceptance, tolerance"" are well and good, but that is how people ought to act anyway.

By Islam women should dress like that, and she dresses like that. I'm saying that people of Balkan have tribe like nature, so do Muslims who come from different countries. Very tight familial relationships, I don't live on Balkan anymore, I live in western Europe, I hang out with Muslim immigrant population, and they all have strong familial relationship, like I do, they feel like they belong in that group, and that is hard to change. In west you are taught to be an individual, so you behave like a one, but in the east we form clans, groups, and we are connected. Being rejected by that group falls hard on people. That's my point. Are you claiming that Muslim families don't have strong relationship and don't stick with their own in UK?

What a poor response. I am simply restating what they said they are going to do. That the protests and often rioting is going to go through Europe. That is what they said. They said it about UK before the protests happened.

Policing in the U.S. is very local. Most states don‚Äôt have a state police force, and if they do, they only handle select issues. There are no national police, and no organization at the national level. 

You asked who they answer to, and that depends. In nearly all cases, they answer to local elected officials ‚Äî mayors, district attorneys, police commissioners, or sheriffs (yes, elected). In most cases their immediate leaders are career professionals, but they are sometimes politicians, as is the case with sheriffs. 

So how police act, are regulated, trained, disciplined, and handle situations varies a lot from town to town, county to county, and state to state. It‚Äôs all about the local recruiting, training, professionalism, leadership, and culture. It‚Äôs why you see some police in areas participating in the protests, and in others, actively agitating them. 

Not all American police are monsters, or even bad people. Some, in some places, are terrible, and that‚Äôs often a result of the local situation there. 

American police do have more authority than their European counterparts in most cases (though not always, French police seem to be able to detain anyone who looks at them...), and are faster to use force.

The part that intrigues me is that the early nudist culture in America was not THAT different than that of Europe, but for whatever reason, the family naturist thing took root in Europe where the puritan values of the US seemed to kill those ideals dead as we made our way into the swinging sixties.

I also find it interesting that the first place most Americans think of when they think of naked in Europe is Cap d'Adge, France, which to most French people is the antithesis of family naturism and more like closely aligned with those trendy nudist US destinations that cater to adults. But as it happens, there are well over 200 ""naturist campings"" in France alone, and we have yet to visit one that doesn't have a fairly even demographic ranging from young families to pensioners. Some of them even belong to a consortium of naturist venues so they can share the expense of producing a simple website and marketing materials, but in the last place, those materials are more appealing than ANYthing produced by 80% of nudist places in the US. For that matter, you can put up a website on a wordpress blog with a built in theme and formatting, good to go, for less that $100 a year. In 2020, any prospective naturist is going to make the web search the first stop for any potential outing, ESPECIALLY if they're simply trying to figure out what family oriented nudism is all about. 

As to demand, I spend a lot of time with college-aged kids, and I think we're entering a time where a new audience could be won over pretty easily if they could figure the whole thing out and it was affordable to participate. Just as it has been in the past, we have a generation of young humans who are fed up with societal norms, and would likely get naked if there were a few more places for people in their demographic where it's comfortable to do so. This COULD be the golden moment, but if a 25 year-old lands on the antiquated page about Saturday's lingerie dance and covered dish dinner, it's gonna be a non-starter.

Just because there are Jews indigenous to Palestine, doesn't mean European Jews can invade Palestine by association. That's such a pathetically weak argument. You also seem to forget that Judaism was a religion before jt became an ethno-religion, so most Jews would've converted to Christiniaty and then Islam 1-2 thousand years ago.
