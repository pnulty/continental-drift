World War One is not an example of the economic ties and diplomatic strength, it was, in fact, the very lack of strong diplomatic communication that the Seminal Catastrophe. The Seminal Tragedy of the Seminal Catastrophe was that at many opportunities, the war could have been avoided had communication, knowledge and understanding been stronger. Misunderstandings, Miscommunication and political tension made it inevitable for a conflict. Europe was not in a state of positive deterrence, especially considering the arms race, imperialism and militarism at the time. This is not a real-world example. Positive deterrence has played a crucial role in peace and stability from the end of the Suez Canal Crisis to the Iran Nuclear Deal. These are examples of true success that we must follow, not the mistakes and lack of technology of the past.

The Potsdam Declaration was not intended to allow the Japanese to decide how post-war Japan would stand. To quote the preamble ""*We will not deviate from them. There are no alternatives. We shall brook no delay.*"" The Ultimatum had two options, unconditional surrender or face annihilation. As I've already stated, in the end, Japan faced annihilation not through rejection, rather through mistranslation. 

It's important to note, that those nations who attempt to ascertain these nuclear weapons are out of fear themselves from current nuclear powers, they are pushed by this cycle to defend themselves in threats and after Iraq and Libya, that is no surprise. Nuclear perpetuate these cycles of conflict, tension and violence. M.A.D is a redundant doctrine which in itself only creates less trust, less cooperation, more isolation.

First off, I didn't accuse you of racism, quit being such a fucking snowflake.  Am I supposed to read shit like that and take you seriously? 

And yes, WI does have some of the worst race problems in the country. This is so widely established that I'm not really sure what to say.  

* Milwaukee is the most highly segregated city in America.  

* Effectively segregated schools (no wonder they chant racist slurs at visiting sports teams - on multiple occasions).  

* Incarceration rate for blacks that is twice the national average, despite having what is actually a pretty middling murder rate.  (Barely more than one third of Louisiana's, who wears the crown.)  And despite all that talk of violence, most of them are locked up for non-violent drug crime.  Huh, weird.

&gt;To blame the problem entirely on racism is completely disingenuous, you simply did not look at more than a single number to come to this conclusion. I think the Hispanic comparison is an extremely strong counter argument and I'd like to hear a response if you have one. 

I didn't blame this on racism entirely.  I merely said WI has some of the worst racial justice problems in America, which is *factually true.*  There is no coherent argument against this.

So why don't Latinos end up in jail as much?  I don't know, and it doesn't matter.  I said black people have awful outcomes in WI, that's all.

The thing is, you made my argument for me:

&gt;These people are in desperate need of help. The funding of schools comes from the property tax of the surrounding area, so poor neighborhoods remain uneducated, which fuels the poverty, crime, etc. These problems disproportionately affect the Black community because they are also entrenched in cultural problems that reinforce every negative aspect of the system, even when compared to other poverty stricken demographics both White as well as Hispanic as well as Asian.

*I agree.*

These are problems everywhere with disparate race outcomes.  Anywhere in America, Canada, Europe, Sri Lanka, anywhere.  WI has it worse, though.  Why?

Is it because of their low IQ?  Why would it be specifically lower in WI than in NY?

Whether the introduction of the Braves mascot was snarky, nasty &amp; cruel is open for debate, sure. Maybe it is racist. But it is not an example of appopriation. 

The reason it's so murky is because so many people don't know what the words they're using *even mean*.

Learn to identify those people and they won't perplex you. 

But the meaning is definite and clear and the fact that careless angry people don't bother learning it doesn't mean you have to be confused too. Cultural appropriation means taking another group's symbols (images, behaviors or artifacts) and overriding their meaning with something else. So that the original group can't use them the same way in some context.  

That's the key thing. It has to take away some meaning that used to be there. Mere mockery doesn't do it, even if you're mocking the symbols directly. Using the symbols in a way consistent with their meaning doesn't do it either - which is why a European wearing a kimono to a festival is not appropriation, and neither is a Japanese man wearing a tuxedo. One must twist the symbol's usage, or force it out of its original framework of meaning entirely, in order to have a shot at appropriation.

Thank goodness for that.

&gt; I'm saying atheists are idiots like the rest of us

Maybe you're an idiot, I personally am not.

&gt; I'm religious now

Then you were always religious and in denial. No one converts to atheism and then converts back, that doesn't make any logical sense. In order to reject religion you have to understand why its claims are silly, and you can't undo that knowledge.

&gt;although I won't declare which because I'm not entirely sure myself

So you're not actually religious, because knowing what your religion teaches is one of the key parts of religion.

&gt;An atheists who believes that being an atheist is the correct path because the church has killed in the past is silly.

No such person exists.

&gt; The atheists have killed too, they've killed tens of millions.

Well probably, but no one has killed in the name of no god.

&gt;They've actively persecuted many faiths in Russia, China, the Balkans, Catalonia and many more places.

No they haven't.

&gt;Purging the idea of God from people's minds won't make them stop them from killing each other.

No, but a) no atheists are suggesting that people can't choose to be religious, and b) it removes a common excuse for killing.

&gt;So the idea that atheism will liberate people is absurd.

Secular societies are universally better off and less violent.

&gt;Calling humans tiny in the universe we exist in is a massive exaggeration.

You are, compared to the scale of the universe, small. That does not mean anything by itself, size is not a measure of ""goodness"".

&gt;Yet some arrogant human will preach how they're intelligent

Intelligence is not a measure of how big you are, it's the capacity to understand new information.

&gt;we are gargantuan deities of unimaginable size compared to much smaller microscopic life such as viruses

Only humans are observed to believe in gods, likely due to the size of our brains. Viruses aren't even alive in any conventional sense.

&gt;We dont even understand consciousness properly. We dream and we abstract.

Classic god-of-the-gaps. Just because we don't know everything doesn't mean you can cram magic into the holes in our understanding.

&gt;Even if we do get into space and colonize the galaxy, within time nothing out there will be a homo sapien either.

Non-sequitur. This has nothing to do with religion or the lack thereof.

&gt;Religion has been around for as long as humanity has

Longer, in fact.

&gt;it obviously has benefits for us

No more than murder does, which has been around just as long. Non-sequitur.

&gt;It would've died out as many other ideas and beliefs had.

The whole reason religion hasn't died is that people keep reproducing, and brainwashing those children into their religion. That's not proof that religions are useful or (more importantly) true.

&gt;Every culture entered recorded history believing in something

Atheists are fully capable of believing in all manner of things, they just don't believe in a god.

&gt;There's no sacred text of atheism. It just comes to the conclusion that there is no God because well, because, my human mind came to that conclusion.

This suggests that you need a book to tell you what is true. Sorry to tell you, but books don't actually have to be true, quite a lot are fiction. And yes, all evidence indicates that there is no god.

&gt;Its meaningless and damaging to a society, it erodes at its cohesion in very detrimental ways. Are atheists moral? Well yes, most are, just as most religious people are moral as well.

You just refuted your own claim for me.

&gt; If a dog sees two sticks on the ground, it can't count to two, it just sees the sticks. 

But ""twoness"" is a concept we invented, it doesn't actually exist independent of a human observer.

&gt;We as humans can perform some very advanced calculations, in our head. What else goes on in our heads, well we dream.

No connection between these things. A haemorrhage can also occur in the head.

&gt;So how does this apply to God?

Great question!

&gt;If, and strictly if, God does physcially exist, it would definitely be beyond our comprehension

How convenient that normal logical rules don't apply to god. That's special pleading.

&gt;just as consciousness itself is currently

No, it's beyond our *understanding*. We can fully comprehend it, just not fully explain the mechanisms behind it.

&gt; I believe atheism impacts things in different ways, more fundamental ways than just the burning at the stake or throwing homosexuals off of buildings, or sacrificing children at the altar of Melqart. Its spiritually corrosive.

Yes, and all the advanced irreligious societies are a smokescreen for the destruction that will come any day now... any day now. I hope it gets here before Jesus comes back to rule the Earth!

&gt;Dont argue, saying that there is no such thing as spirituality either.

Who is arguing that?

&gt;People can experience very powerful and impactful things throughout their lives.

Yes, but you believe that those experiences mean something, whereas I understand that people can suffer from all kinds of delusions and biases that may cloud their judgement of events.

&gt;Psychedelic drugs for example literally opened another gateway into the minds.

No they didn't ""literally"" open any gates, or figuratively. Drugs do not make your brain better, they make it considerably worse, as you would expect based on the observed effects.

&gt;It's ironic how the most godless society on earth, China

China is not the most ""godless"" society, the vast majority of people follow the traditional religions of the region. The most ""godless"" societies are found in Europe, along with Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

&gt;China, is experiencing the largest growth of Christianity on the planet

Because very few people are christian, and thus conversion is at the maximum. If you count births along with conversions then Africa hosts the largest growing christian populations...

&gt;now secular ones are experiencing mass growth of Islam.

No they aren't. Islam only grows rapidly because its adherents have a high birth rate. And in a stunning case of irony China has a huge population of muslims (some 30 million strong). Comparably the western nation with the highest proportion of muslims, Sweden, are just 8% of its population. The total muslim population in the west is less than 1% of the total.

This book is really an edited together set of peer-reviewed journal articles. It is still a bit jargon-y if you're not super familiar with political science journals, but it's still something that can be picked up and read.

It's going to be a straight-up contrast to Downs. There's lots of critiques that Downs is easy fodder for - but that requires accepting that Downs theory is fundamentally sound albeit in need of improvement. Ferguson's work is based off an observation Downs made regarding the information inequality - with regard to policy preferences - between economic elites and the average voter...but Downs just handwaived that issue away rather than deal with it. Ferguson, and many other since then, actually dealt with it.

Of course the mere interaction with the issue of income inequality and money in politics is itself a highly political topic within the realm of political science. 

Ferguson's approach is something wholly different from Downs. Frankly when his original paper, which is part of the book, came out in 1983 it gained almost no traction. When he published the book in 1995 (with further papers included) it still didn't get much traction. Honestly Thomas Ferguson's professional career was not of much interest outside wonks and polsci people.

In other words just dealing with this topic was toxic. So much of political science depends, sadly, on endowments and other gifts from the well-heeled that are threatened by the examination of how they operate. Another person who's examined this topic, albeit from the sociology point of view, is William Domhoff out of UC Santa Cruz. 

But Ferguson's theories started taking on serious consideration in the 2000s.

And there's also a great review article that is great if you can get access to it

---

In general this whole topic seems to be one that only already-established academics are willing to tackle. I've seen a few PhD students who've done dissertations over Ferguson's or Domhoff's work, and it's like they're toxic when it comes time for job talks. Examining this whole topic is something many academic departments are, it seems, encouraged to stop from occurring. The only reason established academics get away with it is because of the power of being a Full Professor - nothing left to gain and unable to be punished for working on the topic.

All of this to say that if this area *does* interest you and you do decide to go into political science academia realize this is the area where you're likely to be encouraged to not go. Even if your dissertation committee allows it they'll likely strongly discourage you from doing so (albeit this discouragement will be done privately) for the shear reality of the inability to find good employment: getting a job in the academy is hard enough, political science is honestly even harder, and doing all of that with a super-controversial field of interest that steps on the toes of major donors is just a recipe for professional disaster. 

But that doesn't mean you shouldn't be read in the topic. As an academic its your job to know this stuff and to understand how it may impact the qual/quant data you're gather in a completely different area; knowing about the Investment Theory may explain a weird quirk you're seeing that you cannot otherwise explain.

I find it a bit rich to hear from some members of this house that Northern Ireland will be the most affected by our Exit from the European Union -- and thus deserve a special say during the process. The government is negotiating on behalf of our whole United Kingdom, and it has already pledged multiple times to consult and discuss the proceedings of the negotiations with the home nations. Now more than ever, Mr. Deputy Speaker, we must remain united instead of fragmenting based on personal goals and convictions. The United Kingdom voted twice in a row to leave the European Union and it's mechanisms, much like the EU27 it is important for the United Kingdom not to succumb to infighting over the antics of Brexit. We must shed our regional and political skins and come together as one United Kingdom to deliver a Brexit which works for all. For those reasons, Mr. Deputy Speaker, although I am convinced this bill's intentions are good, I can not in good conscience support this bill.

Great, so he's essentially White because the berbers are a basically a White people.

Berbers are Caucasians and most look like southern Europeans. The friend is White.

Secularity (adjective form secular, from Latin saeculum meaning ""worldly"", ""of a generation"", ""temporal"", or a span of about 100 years) is the state of being separate from religion, or of not being exclusively allied with or against any particular religion. Historically, the word ""secular"" was not related or linked to religion, but was a freestanding term in Latin which would relate to any mundane endeavor. The idea of a dichotomy between religion and the secular originated in the 18th century European Enlightenment. Furthermore, since ""religion"" and ""secular"" are both Western concepts that were formed under the influence of Christian theology, other cultures do not necessarily have words or concepts that resemble or are equivalent to them.

That being said it was far left ideas and forms of government that cost millions of people their lives. Fascist were the ones to actually be your typical street thug enforcers (brown shirts) who beat and/or killed any opposition to the nazis in Germany, all the way up the socialist ladder of that particular establishment. Italy was also ripe with fascism under Mussolini who was one of the dictators hung as the war was wrapping up. 

Long story short, it was leftest ideals that were trying to take hold of the world during this very volatile time in our history. And they almost did at the cost of millions of lives.

You can add photos by uploading them externally (e.g. imgur.com), and photos are absolutely necessary to see if it really is a Firecrest or rather your native and very similar Golden-crowned kinglet. 

No matter the species, it should be fine to be released into the wild once healthy. A lone bird doesn't make an invasive species and will also find the habitat it needs in North America. If you feel it does need care, contact your local wildlife rehab centre.

I've never heard of any kinglet species being kept as pets, so if it really is a Firecrest it may have been blown across the Atlantic from Europe, especially seeing as you mentioned a storm (do you live in the eastern US?). Here in Germany we have a law that forbids people from keeping wild animals as pets, but I don't know the American legislation on the topic. Anyway, releasing it into the wild is the better option and, as I mentioned before, not damaging.

Another important point to consider is that you should report the find to the rarities committee. I don't know how it's structured in the US, but in Europe there are local and national raritiy committees that discuss all observations of unusual birds in the area they are responsible for and keep track of all records of vagrants.

&gt; The Police were a new wave band which formed in 1977 in London, England. The band consisted of Sting (vocals, bass), Andy Summers (guitar) and Stewart Copeland (drums).  The band released five albums -- ""Outlandos d'Amour"" (1978), ""Reggatta de Blanc"" (1979), ""Zenyatta Mondatta"" (1980), ""Ghost in the Machine"" (1982) and ""Synchronicity"" (1983) -- before entering a hiatus in 1984 and ultimately disbanding in 1986

&gt; The band reunited in January 2007 for a reunion tour that lasted until August 2008. 

&gt; Biography 

&gt; The Police formed in early 1977 in London by Stewart Copeland (drums), Gordon Sumner, better known as Sting (bass and lead vocals), and Henry Padovani (guitar). Andy Summers later joined the group, and after a very short stint as a quartet, Padovani left the band. The Police became one of the most popular bands in the late 70s and throughout the 80s.

&gt; The Police are notable as one of the first mainstream white pop groups to adopt reggae as a predominant musical form and to score major international hits with reggae-styled material. (The first all-white reggae band with permanent members and frequent recording in Europe was Peps Blodsband, lead by Peps Persson from south Sweden who changed from blues to reggae 1974/75). Although reggae was already very popular in the United Kingdom (due to the large number of Caribbean immigrants) and a number of Western European countries, reggae was little known in the United States and rejected by most black artists in U.S, and prior to the emergence of the Police only a handful of reggae songs had enjoyed any significant chart success. The Police, UB40, The Clash and Bob Marley (Jamaican, partly living in England after being shot in Jamaica, are considered with a number of new wave, rock and ska bands as one of the leaders of the Second British Invasion of the U.S.

&gt; The Police were strongly influenced by reggae (especially reggae drumming and base lines), jazz and, in the beginning, punk rock – something that came to be shifted more and more towards pop during the 80s. Their lyrics also changed from challenging, but yet somewhat politically restrained punk- and new wave lyrics, to after 1982 in some songs emphasize environmental awareness and human oneness. The biggest hits, however, had romantic or sexual themes. The Police met together with other ""white"" British bands which played reggae, as UB40,  criticism from black English rastafarian reggae bands like Aswad (in a BBC documentary on TV) and Steel Pulse, for being accomplices in the music industry of ""Babylon"", stealing the Caribbean slave descendants' musical treasure. This criticism has later been withdrawn. Aswad has even made the covers of Police songs like ""Roxanne"".

&gt; Tension grew between the band members, because unlike most other bands, they did not share songwriting credits. They released their last album, Synchronicity, in 1983, selling over 8 million copies. Synchronicity is critically regarded as their best album, with hits such as Synchronicity II, King of Pain, and probably their best known song, Every Breath You Take. In 1984, after touring in support of Synchronicity, The Police went on hiatus while Sting pursued his acting and solo music careers. Two years later, The Police reformed and played a few concerts for Amnesty International.  Soon after the band went into the studio. Sting wanted to re-record their old songs but Andy and Stewart wanted to leave the originals alone and only two songs were re-recorded during these studio sessions. Although the group is considered to have disbanded in 1984, 1986 was the last time The Police engaged in any musical activity. 

&gt; In 1992 the band released ""Message in a Box"", their 4 CD box set, and performed at Sting's wedding to Trudie Styler.  A live CD was released in June 1995. On March 10, 2003 The Police were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  and performed Message in a Bottle, Roxanne and Every Breath You Take.

&gt; The Police reformed in 2007 and opened the Grammy award ceremony of that year with a performance of Roxanne. Towards the end of May the band began a world tour.  In  2008  the tour ended at Madison Square Garden, New York on August 7, and The Police disbanded for good.  Sting was quoted towards the end of the tour that he had achieved closure with the band and revealed that The Police would never tour or record again. 

&gt; Sting has said that the material on the album Ghost in the Machine were inspired by the writings of Arthur Koestler, and that the Police's final studio album Synchronicity was influenced by the writings of Carl Jung. Sting also peppers his songs with literary allusions: the song ""Don't Stand So Close to Me"" mentions Vladimir Nabokov's  novel Lolita; ""Tea in the Sahara"" alludes to the novel The Sheltering Sky by Paul Bowles; and ""Wrapped Around Your Finger"" refers both to the sea monsters Scylla and Charybdis, from Greek mythology, and to Mephistopheles, from the German legend of Faust .

**Bulgaria secretly sells battle for 3 billion euros**

*We are buying a new Air Force squadron*

The Finance Ministry has displaced 200,000 cops seized by the Prosecutor's Office after a successful operation against customs fraudsters. The transaction was secretly concluded at the most advantageous moment at the end of December 2017 and has brought to the budget 6 billion levs, which means that for one battle we have taken 15 000 euros.

This was reported by Vladislav Goranov to the Security Council at the Prime Minister, who was summoned for the Skripal case. The real topic, however, was what to do with this money. The idea of ​​buying squadrons of new aircraft for the army.

Several sovereign wealth funds and Asian investors have bought the bitch on a secret auction, which was a Deloitte consultant. Experts from the US FBI have helped to ensure the safety of the transactions that have been deferred over time, the latter being scheduled for the early hours of April 1, Goranov reported.

The reshuffle was necessary in order not to collapse the market with such a powerful one-off offering of battlefields, according to an expert from the CoinDesk site, to which Biovoly has consulted. From there, they checked the cryptographic statistics and confirmed that from now until now, an unknown operator had poured a little over 198,000 battleships. According to experts, this is one reason why the price of the crypto-wave drops slowly.

For the confiscated battlefield, it was understood that on May 29, 2017, the Southeast European Crime Counterfeiting Center (SELEC) announced on its official site the large-scale international operation PRAKTA / VIRUS, in which the Bulgarian authorities seized over 200,000 battleships. Subsequently, the Prosecutor's Office and the GDOC disowned it, but it was part of the conspiracy operation - the most successful in our service history.

According to Bivolov, Prime Minister Borisov will offer Sotir Tsatsarov, Vlady Goranov and himself for government awards.

&gt; Your reasoning? [...] What makes your interpretation of this data any more reliable than any other?

I stumbled on another consideration wrt the €Z today which I'd not come across before — and also a very cool practical demonstration of the phenomenon of harmonic entrainment, which is worth watching for its own sake — but I think complements what I said about the € facilitating risk to Europe's economy making Europe *more fragile* rather than more robust:

Because of the unregulated, free flow of €s between otherwise independent economies denominated in €s that I mentioned yesterday, those economies become coupled by a process analogous to harmonic entrainment which is a phenomenon [better demonstrated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aaxw4zbULMs) than explained.  Have a watch, it's less than two minutes long.

The explanation of what's going on in that clip is that each metronome is an independent system that nevertheless exerts a small influence on the environment.  When the five metronomes are on the desk, that tiny influence is entirely absorbed by the much heavier desk.  

But when the board of five metronomes is decoupled from the desk and allowed to move freely, those small influences sum together such that each metronome is influenced by the other four metronomes via the board.  Because each metronome receives four times the influence than it influences the other four, all five metronomes become entrained and eventually synchronise.  

When the board is put back on the desk, the mutual influence is absorbed by the desk again, the influence internal to each metronome reasserts itself and the metronomes return to their desynchronised behaviour since none of them are perfectly set to the same frequency.

In [another of his lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq3s-Ifx1Fo), Mark Blyth draws the analogy between the € and the board and argues that changes to one €Z economy affects all the others because the € provides completely frictionless coupling between each economy.  The effect might be unnoticeable (most fiscal policy decisions) or very large (Greece), and it's often not possible to predict the specific effect of a specific policy on an economy in general (because economic actors try to turn the rules to their advantage, whatever the rules are).

The potential upsides are as profound as the potential downsides: if things go well, they'll amplify and go really, really well.  If things go badly, the pain is equally amplified.  Since we know that things routinely and repeatedly do go badly from time to time, again the € acts as a conduit and to amplify the damage.  

At least when fiscal policy, monetary policy and currency are unified (whether in a member state or federal incarnation), currency exchange rates can absorb economic shocks affecting only trades across the exchange and not trade exclusively within the currency.

For that to happen, there has to be a plurality of currencies, the more the better (within reason).  Contrast a world in which there were only five currencies: the €, US$, Chinese Renminbi, Indian Rupee and Nigerian Naira versus a world in which there are several dozen currencies that really matter plus a hundred more mostly inconsequential ones.

If FX rates act as shock absorbers, then one or more of the other currencies has to take the other side of that shock.  The fewer currencies that exist, the harder the shock the others take.  Worse, the 5-currency world pits those 5 super-economies against one another, inviting trade wars because the size of each economy doesn't make the macroeconomic effects of trade imbalance go away.

Let me reiterate: I don't hate the € but I do perceive it as a grave threat to economic stability (at least, as it now is structured) and maybe, in turn, even to world peace because wars, both international and civil, tend to foment in times of economic trouble.  I pass no moral judgement on the €, but I do want to see problems fixed when identified and threats mitigated when they can't be fixed.",True,False,0,1522586661,,1522586940,0,dwmhue6,False,t3_87gffw,True,t1_dwjv9gb,/r/ukpolitics/comments/87gffw/beleave_revelations_taint_the_brexit_result_there/dwmhue6/,,1525817782,1,False,True,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,public,

[#4](https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17614762223#post-1) - a combination of hating the fact that BGs have templates, russians are in BGs and class changes

[#5](https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/13604831411#post-1) - this guy finds pve boring, despite it being largely unchanged for a decade and a half and pvp unbalanced, despite it never being balanced.

I could go on but yeah, i think i proved my point to some degree. People like these guys generally don't quit the game, they are just upset about something so they mask it as something else - upset that your item didn't drop? twist it and pretend they're upset pve is boring. Upset that you can't get good rating in pvp? Pretend pvp is imbalanced, despite playing the best class of that season, etc.

Of the 5 posts above, 4 of them have not quit. The one that has was the guy complaining about BGs. That guy has 2.5k achievement points and 1.2k of them are in pvp.

“New Iron Harvest look based on your feedback 
Hi guys. As you know, we value your opinion and are all about listening to the community. In our ""What is Kickstarter"" video, we introduced a cute mech and people loved it.



This was the last bit of confirmation we needed to make a big decision: We’re going to change the look &amp; feel of Iron Harvest to something more stylized, colorful. There are plenty of good reasons to do it:

Everybody keeps telling us that international audiences, especially in parts of Asia, want bright colours instead of depressing European “mud colours”.
Realistic materials and colours make some units harder to see.
When you look at the most successful current games – free-to-play mobile games – they are all brightly coloured and friendlier than our current look.
Blizzard does it and learning from Blizzard means learning how to win.
We think we are on the right track here and hope you guys support our decision.



We’ll keep improving Iron Harvest with your help and we wish you all a happy April.

Again what a load of bullshit. You see them at every protest being violent. No one says that the blue-haired chubby art majors that pull fire alarms whenever an 'offensive' speaker is at their campus is antifa. They probably supports antifas actions though since you can often see them wearing antifa pins and saying the same things that antifa does such as ""kill nazis"".

False,Stlieutenantprincess,,,,"Henry Borynski was a Polish priest who disappeared on 13th July 1953 in Bradford, Yorkshire when he left his residence following a phone call.


Borynski was an out spoken anti-communist who had escaped from Poland in 1940. In the early 1950s there were approximately 6,000 European refugees in Bradford, a number of which reported to have been approached by officials from the Soviet Embassy in London who tried to pressured them to return to their home countries. Borynski was one of several Yorkshire-based Polish chaplains who led protests in October 1952 against the activities of Russian Soviet agents.


Borynski received two telephone calls on 13th July 1953. Following the first telephone call, he visited Canon Martynellis (Martynellis was the priest who Borynski had replaced but Martynellis was refusing to relocate). Martynellis told reporters that Borynski had come to see him because he said he had received a call from someone claiming to be speaking on his behalf. Mártynellis said he hadn't phoned Borynski or agreed for anyone to phone on his behalf. Later that evening Borynski received another call from a man speaking Polish (Borynski was heard by his Polish housekeeper speaking in clipped sentences during the call, not his usual cheerful manner). Borynski said ""Now this has come, I go"", and left with his coat and hat but left his wallet and personal papers at home.


A month after Borynski's disappearance Martynellis was found collapsed at his home. Martynellis claimed that he had been visited by two men who had ordered him to keep quiet. However, In 2003 a retired British police detective, Bob Taylor, stated that he believed Borynski was murdered by the Polish Secret Police. Taylor further claimed that Martynellis was involved with Polish agents in arranging Borynski's abduction. Borynski has never been found dead or alive.

But in Takanaa it's not like the person-marking of Indo-European or Uralic languages.

Manual labour and many present day service industry jobs will be highly automated, if it's still under capitalism, a lot of people will be reliant on basic income or welfare (we're already pushing the limits of training for intellectual labour - many people are already below the capacity of being educated to do the higher skilled jobs). If we're under some automated form of socialised production or syndicalism, we might be doing a lot better (sharing the benefits as opposed to hoping for scraps off the table from an uncaring elite that's already leaving us behind). I don't really believe the credit-driven consumer spending trinkets and glitter economy can really survive the coming wave of automation (do we want it to if we can efficiently provid comfortable subsistence with automated tools?). Energy-wise we'll be reliant on Nuclear, Wind, Tidal and solar - oil will be prohibitively expensive and insufficient to serve our energy needs. Maybe rural Ireland can transition back to a preindustrial style cottage industry economy, made comfortable with the aid of machines and the lack of an imperial jackboot on our backs.

We may be debating or grappling with AI, the rights of thinking machines, weighing up the benefits of their enslavement versus the franchise of conscious beings. Maybe the internet will evolve into some kind of networked hivemind thing, a Borg collective or a Matrix type situation where people choose to live in virtual worlds or join a gestalt consciousness.

If there's a major war in the meantime, expect a giant leap in both technological progress and a major regression of personal freedoms and ecological stability. Present day borders, power structures, economic norms could all be burned away in the fire of a post-Nuclear era war.

As regards immigration, I'm optimistic much of the current turmoil in the world will be resolved as the multi-polar imperialist superpowers divide up Africa and the Middle-East among themselves and begin to industrialize (already happening).

No, I am in fact a moderate. All of my positions are moderate. The survival of my people is not an extreme premise. Nothing could be more sensible than survival.

What those who call me extreme and who call themselves ""centrist"" fail to understand, through lack of historical perspective, are two fundamental facts:

1) that the center is always defined relative to the existing political spectrum, and 2) that the existing political spectrum has been almost perpetually shifting to the Left.

It is not a static position nor a persistent ideology. What is called ""centrist"" today would have been called ""progressive"" yesterday, and what you call ""extreme"" today would have been considered ""moderate"" yesterday. You can't be neutral on a moving train.

Let's take an example. During the passage of the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965, the bills supporters had to convince the public that the new law would not change the demographics of the United States (something which ultimately [turned out to be false](http://rightrealist.com/images/race/debate/OriginImmigrants.png)). The reason they had to convince people of this was because the ""moderate"" political desire of the public at that time was the preservation of the largely European demographics of the country. Wanting to preserve a mostly white nation used to be the mainstream, common sense position, while today it is ""extreme"" and ""racist.""

What a ""moderate"" or ""centrist"" today really means is not a person who is ""sensible and rational,"" but a person who meekly conforms to the popular opinions of his day. And those popular opinions were radically progressive just a few short years ago.

Here is data from the Netherlands showing that second generation immigrants commit more crime than first generation immigrants:


&gt;Of native male youths between the ages of 18 and 24, in 2002 2.2% were arrested, of all immigrant males of the same age 4.4%, of second generation non-Western males 6.4%. The crime rates for so‐called ‘Western migrants’ were very close to those of the native Dutch.

And here is more looking at Europe more generally:

&gt; - Understanding variations in crime patterns is necessary in order to properly assist different immigrant groups. This is especially true for the second generation which seems to experience—on average, and in most countries—higher crime rates than their parents’ generation. 




&gt; - Historic and contemporary research findings show that second-generation immigrants in the United States and Western Europe have higher crime rates than their parents’ generation.

False,claremont_waltz,influential anthony image,,Susan B. Anthony,"I agree, moral hazard is important. In a sane monetary regime there's no reason for banks to get FDIC style deposit insurance or to be rescued and the economy would be better off for it. 

Unfortunately because we appoint utter fucking morons like Trichet to central banks and they allow nominal indicators like NGDP to collapse, we have to bail out random sectors or risk total economic collapse. And because the utter fucking morons are from finance, we end up with bailouts of banks. If they were from cement companies you'd see cement company bailouts and it'd be just as helpful for employment in the broader economy (not at all). 

Oh and because Trichet saved his buddies he immediately landed a great paycheck and job at a bank after presiding over the single greatest economic collapse in the history of the Euro zone and the second greatest for Europe. And because governments don't understand how monetary policy works despite the work of Milton Friedman, he also ended up with all sorts of fancy awards and orders of merit after pushing millions of people into unemployment with policies that were obviously wrong even at the time he was making them. Nobody could possibly justify a rate rise in 2008, let alone two more in 2011, but that fucking moron Trichet did it anyway. 

I want to be clear how important nominal factors are. Japan tried stable prices and fiscal stimulus for twenty odd years and got dick all out of it. No growth, no inflation, no real movement in prices. Shinzo Abe comes in and demands the central bank do whatever it takes to hit their inflation target and boom, growth, no more depreciation, pay rises and even jobs for young people. And now the same fucking morons that cost Japan decades of growth are demanding rate rises just as they're starting to return to a more normal situation because ~1% inflation might spiral into Zimbabwe style hyperinflation at any moment...... 

And no, it's not misleading to say QE cost nothing. It's misleading to say it didn't make a profit when it did. IMO if governments had really wanted to do QE in a sane manner they'd have handed free cash to a Euro wide sovereign wealth fund and had it invest in all sorts of European assets. They'd have done better out of it and they'd have dealt with reasonable criticism like yours. Instead, yes, it was used to prop up banks even as they and everyone else were being choked to death by tight money. If someone needed to be choked out it should have been Trichet and people like him. Unfortunately instead it was millions of ordinary people whose sole crime was happening to live in a monetary unions led by a complete and utter fucking boob.

False,El_Kyle,,,Basque is ancient monkey language,"Well, the idea that Lithuanian is the most conservative IE language persists for a few reasons. A few comments have addressed this already but I will go into more detail. 

First, intonation in Lithuanian had attracted scholars throughout the 19th century. They had noticed a correspondence between the Lithuanian acute tone and the Sanskrit long vowel, and between the Lithuanian circumflex tone and the Sanskrit short vowel. e.g. Lithuanian *pílnas* and Sanskrit *pūrás* (meaning 'full'), and Lithuanian *pãdas* and Sanskrit *pád* ('sole' and 'foot' respectively). 

de Saussure came along and claimed that Lithuanian intonation was in fact a continuation of PIE vowel length. He devised some theories that ultimately proved to be wrong, but he laid some *very* important groundwork. In 1927, linguist Jerzy Kuryłowicz recognized a further correspondence with certain Hittite consonants, which led to the Laryngeal Theory. *pílnas* and *pūrás* came from PIE **pḷh1nós* ! 

Accentuation (acute and falling), is also a key element in Lithuanian's perceived similarity to PIE. While other IE languages have developed a fixed stress system (initial, penultimate, ultimate, etc.), Lithuanian retained a free and mobile stress system (even its fellow Baltic language, Latvian, lost this).  PIE also had variable lexical stress, and stressed vowels in PIE reliably have a rising tone in Lithuanian as a reflex, and vice versa for unstressed vowels. 

Lastly, the nominal cases in Lithuanian are remarkably similar to PIE. [Here is a basic table I drew up a couple years ago to spare me from writing more.](https://imgur.com/a/q0pJr)

That applies to pretty much everything.

&gt;Tesla doesn’t drive policy changes or even the research to fight climate change. 

Should tesla start lobbying for policy change or invest in research?  I think the research and guidelines for reducing pollution have been already done and guidelines already established. See Paris Accord


&gt;All it does is say we have zero emission electric cars, we are working towards a sustainable future. 

That's already good enough. 

&gt;e cars are expensive and solar roofs/shingles/panels cost an arm and a leg. How can you possibly think that this is the solution?

Their plan is to target the market that can afford it first. People that have lots of disposable income and are somewhat aware of issues will chose to buy a model s or x over a luxury vehicle from an established brand or install solar shingles even if it costs more because it looks better. Yes this is the luxury market and your average person will make the rational economical choice and stick to your Honda civic ... For now. But like any technology it's always expensive first. Imagine the first gas engine how complex and expensive production was at first... But with mass production and tech updates it got cheap relatively fast.
Again will Tesla succeed... Who knows... But we are cheering that it does because if it can make an affordable and desirable electric car and stay in business the status quo is changed and the way has been paved.  


&gt;Reality is no matter what you do or believe to be true, it won’t make any difference in the grand scheme of things. 
This thinking leads you not to vote because on the grand scheme of things you are irrelevant. Alone yes we are irrelevant, but like ants together we accomplish great things. What I admire Elon Musk for doing is influencing enough of us to put work and money towards changing our transportation and home energy source. 


&gt;Why is Tesla important? If Tesla fails, Toyota or GM or some new company can take over and do what Tesla was intending to do with EV. 
If you ever owned a company you realized how important it is to have a mission. GM and Toyota are established carmakers that have already a business plan, profit and their investors are conservative. They won't drop everything and go full force on electric cars nor will they do Tesla's job because it's not their mission to do so. They will innovate a bit but follow their industry trend. 



&gt;more mass public transportation and electing right officials is the way to do it.
I agree fully with this one. :)  And I can assure you its what's happening in Europe , Japan , China... In North America not that much. We are behind.  We could have a whole debate on the why that is... But remember just how Elon Musk has support politicians need support as well from their constituents... And guess what these constituents live on a land full of non renewable ressources ( coal, oil ) in a culture where mass transit sucks and is for the poor. Asking for people to vote against their interests is hard. I see this in my country Canada... Where you have these die hard oil fans deniers of climate change... I look where they are from... Alberta... Color me unsurprised but their worldview is obviously in their interest.

So back to Tesla, it is fighting on all fronts and it's surprising to see just how far they have made it. People love to criticize others and blame politicians but respect to those that manage to take things into their own hangs to change the world when they see others don't.

Scientific revolution is a concept used by historians to describe the emergence of modern science during the early modern period, when developments in mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology (including human anatomy) and chemistry transformed the views of society about nature. The scientific revolution took place in Europe towards the end of the Renaissance period and continued through the late 18th century, influencing the intellectual social movement known as the Enlightenment. While its dates are debated, the publication in 1543 of Nicolaus Copernicus's De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres) is often cited as marking the beginning of the scientific revolution.

The concept of a scientific revolution taking place over an extended period emerged in the eighteenth century in the work of Jean Sylvain Bailly, who saw a two-stage process of sweeping away the old and establishing the new.

The way that the Holocaust was treated in the Soviet Union and the comunists countries of the east of europe is is very diferent than western europe and America. Stalin and the NKVD (Beria´s secret police, the predecesor of the KGB) were genuily (for their own purposes) curious about the holocaust and their way of killing people, about the system and everything.  Also Stalin was worried that if the Holocaust was too much highlighted, it woudl mean that the soviet jews had a different suffering than the rest of the soviet people, he didnt wanted a ""special"" people in the soviet union, he wanted to build a some sort ""soviet nationalism"", that basically ""all"" suffered and that could lead to some sort of identification among the russian jews that could affect his idea of ""soviet nationalism""; and remember a lot of ukranians worked for the nazis in the holocaust as guards and helped in the killing and deportation of jews, and he didnt want to blame too heavily in the ukranians because that could affect the union in the soeviet union, even today there is a very strong antisemitism in some parts of ukraine; also countries like Hungary cooperated with the holocaust, also a lot of polish were antisemitic, then Stalin and the Soviet Union coudlnt critize too much those countries who were in the Warsaw Pact.

As he said - if we continue to deny genetics and we let unsavory characters control this information, you're giving them more power.





&gt; Reich simply points out that this utopian fiction is in danger of collapse because it is not true and because genetic research is increasingly proving it untrue. On the male-female divide, for example, Reich cites profound differences, “reflecting more than 100 million years of evolution and adaptation.” On race, he is both agnostic about what we will eventually find out with respect to the scale of genetic differences, and also insistent that genetic differences do exist: “You will sometimes hear that any biological differences among populations are likely to be small, because humans have diverged too recently from common ancestors for substantial differences to have arisen under the pressure of natural selection. This is not true. The ancestors of East Asians, Europeans, West Africans and Australians were, until recently, almost completely isolated from one another for 40,000 years or longer, which is more than sufficient time for the forces of evolution to work.” Which means to say that the differences could be (and actually are) substantial.

&gt; This will lead to subtle variations in human brains, and thereby differences in intelligence tests, which will affect social and economic outcomes in the aggregate in a multiracial, capitalist, post-industrial society. The danger in actively suppressing and stigmatizing this inconvenient truth, he maintains, is that a responsible treatment of these genetic influences will be siloed in the academic field of genetics, will be rendered too toxic for public debate, and will thereby only leak out to people in the outside world via the worst kind of racists and bigots who will distort these truths to their own ends. If you don’t establish a reasonable forum for debate on this, Reich argues, if you don’t establish the principle is that we do not have to be afraid of any of this, it will be monopolized by truly unreasonable and indeed dangerous racists. And those racists will have the added prestige for their followers of revealing forbidden knowledge. And so there are two arguments against the suppression of this truth and the stigmatization of its defenders: that it’s intellectually dishonest and politically counterproductive.

I actually spent some time with a group of people I had nothing in common with before finding some people I liked. I still remember how I approached one guy so I could get into his group. I had seen how he hand his friends were nice people and I wanted in, so one day we were changing classrooms and I just started a conversation. I was extremely shy but that is still one of the best choices I have ever made. Although we did not really hang out that much out of class, we had a great time just by being together in class.

I’d suggest taking a semester off but it sounds like you enjoy what you do, so perhaps keep going is the answer. The life of a uni student is amazing. You are an adult but don’t really have adult issues. You can just mainly focus on what you are studying and know that, for as long as your student life lasts, your main problems will be uni-related, which is not that bad. Try to focus on that. Think that you can feel safe right know because you are doing something you like and this time will give you more chances to find a in the future a job you think is better for you.

I have dealt with depression and one thing I realised is that I lost interest in things that I loved. I gradually stopped caring about tv shows I enjoyed and other activities I liked. And I was totally aware of what was going on, but I just could not be bothered to enjoy them but, as soon as I felt slightly better, I made myself go back to those things so they could cheer me up.

Only marginally so.   It was pretty clearly set in an Eastern European country in 1932, luxurious and formerly wealthy but with a sense on oncoming doom from the growing threat of Nazi Germany and the USSR.    IMHO it was pretty obviously supposed to be a just slightly fictionalized version of real world places (partly Budapest, Hungary, but with some details from other Eastern European cities mixed in.)    But he took some really dark parts of the real world history and made it into a mythoigized and stylized version of itself.    

Again, I haven't seen the new movie so I can't comment on it directly, but if he basically just did the same thing in an Eastern setting he has done before in a European setting I have trouble seeing a problem with it.  Would you be happier if he just didn't use the word ""Japan"" even if it clearly was implied?

&gt;
He does the same thing in New York all the time but we see a million depictions of New York, we get a lot fewer depictions of Japan on the big screen.

Ok, I can see that.   But then isn't there a threat we may get even fewer depictions of Japan if people get offended by examples like this?      

&gt;Its not about isolation or segregation. Its about respect.

Well, it seems like it's about holding people who use references from certain cultures to a higher standard of respect, though, maybe an impossible standard for some people to meet.     And it seems the kind of thing that is likely to hit harder against more nuanced and artistic work, while if you give more controversy to someone like Miley Cyrus it probably just helps her.

""It can be useful since Great Britain will leave the European Union. It's the dream of every kid to play for their country and I had the honor to play for Scotland from the U16's.""

**About his life in Portugal:**

&gt;""Adoro estar cá. Falo a língua de forma fluente e é engraçado ver a forma como aprecias as pequenas coisas. Comecei a gostar imenso de café (expresso). Na Escócia custa duas libras (2,30 euros) e aqui anda à volta de 40 pence (50 cêntimos). Por isso, ando o dia todo a tomar...""

""I love being here. I speak the language fluently and it's funny seeing how you appreciate the smallest things. I started loving coffee (espresso). In Scotland it's about £2 (€2.5) and here it's about £0.4 (€0.5). That's why I'm always drinking coffees...""

&gt;""Tive de crescer de forma muito mais rápida. Na Escócia e Inglaterra teria sido mais fácil, mas tive de aprender uma nova língua e cultura. Tornou-me na pessoa que sou agora. Acredito que os meus melhores dias ainda estão para vir. Estou mais forte, melhor do que era, mas preciso de uma oportunidade. Sei que é tudo à base da paciência, mas isso pode ser complicado. Darei tudo para ser bem sucedido aqui. Só quero jogar"", frisou.

""I had to grow in a very fast way. In Scotland or England it would've been easier, but I had to learn a new language and culture. It made me the person I am today. I believe my best days are yet to come. I'm stronger, better than I was, but I need an opportunity. I know it's about patience, but it can be tough. I'll do everything to succeed here. I just want to play.""

**About his changes:**

&gt;""Trabalhei muito nisto. Não se trata de massa muscular, mas sim em tornar-me mais forte no sentido atlético. Já o fiz e continuo a trabalhar nisso. [No plano do jogo] evoluí maioritariamente no plano defensivo. Vim para cá com 17 anos e agora o meu conhecimento defensivo é muito maior. Do ponto de vista tático tenho maiores certezas do meu posicionamento. Tenho de ser capaz disso antes de entrar em campo. Gosto de acredito que sou o miúdo que é capaz de fazer o jogo avançar, criar oportunidades e marcar uns golos. Isso não vai mudar""

""I worked a lot for this. It's not about muscle mass, but becoming stronger athletically. I've done it and keep doing it. I've improved mostly defensively. I came here as a 17 year old and my defensive knowledge is much more. In a tactical point of view I'm more secure about my positioning. I have to be capable of that before entering the pitch. I like to believe I'm the kid that is capable of making the game progress, create opportunities to score and score some goals. That will not change.""

**About the lack of opportunities:**

&gt;""Sabia que não iria acontecer do dia para a noite. Assinei um contrato de seis anos e é tudo à base da paciência. Senti que quanto mais tempo cá ficasse, melhor seria. Sinto isso. Sei que sou um jogador melhor e uma pessoa mais madura agora"", concluiu.

I don't think that is fully the story. A lot of people seem to be not having kids because of the '*why should you have kids*'-sentiment. The pressure to marry and have children has completely disappeared in just a generation.
You also have a lot of people delaying having children in their 30s and even 40s when their human nature catches up to them and they suddenly feel the need as they realize their purpose in life. (this slows down the replacement rate).

Of course, Japan can always bounce back because Japan is japanese. We western-europeans are pretty darn fucked.

Harold Frederick Shipman (14 January 1946 – 13 January 2004) was a British general practitioner and one of the most prolific serial killers in recorded history. On 31 January 2000, a jury found Shipman guilty of fifteen murders for killing patients under his care. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with the recommendation that he never be released.

The Shipman Inquiry, a two-year-long investigation of all deaths certified by Shipman, which was chaired by Dame Janet Smith, examined Shipman's crimes.

**Anders Behring Breivik**

Fjotolf Hansen, (born Anders Behring Breivik (Norwegian pronunciation: [ˈɑnːəʂ ˈbeːriŋ ˈbræiviːk] ( listen); 13 February 1979) also known by his pseudonym Andrew Berwick, is a Norwegian far-right terrorist who committed the 2011 Norway attacks. On 22 July 2011 he killed eight people by detonating a van bomb amid Regjeringskvartalet in Oslo, then shot dead 69 participants of a Workers' Youth League (AUF) summer camp on the island of Utøya. In August 2012 he was convicted of mass murder, causing a fatal explosion, and terrorism.

On the day of the attacks, Breivik electronically distributed a compendium of texts entitled 2083: A European Declaration of Independence, describing his militant ideology.

They bring their police, their soldiers, their militias, their media domination. They attack us in the streets, they send the FBI to dismantle our political parties, they send soldiers to break out protest.

It's because of this that the left today preaches armed revolution. Not because we want to kill, not because we love school shootings or because we want to pay less taxes. But because we have no other option. They other side does not want peace and meanwhile *people are dying* because of right wing policies. 

We have police killing minorities in the streets and the ones not killing are enforcing laws bases on racism. We have enough food to feed the whole world and enough homes for every American and then some and yet we have starving homeless people. We have a nearly 50/50 split between men and women and yet women are still underrepresented in nearly all walks of life. We have far less black people than white people and yet the black people are targeted 8x more by police than the white ones. 

Please just ask yourself. What do you think disarming minorities and arming the police and military will achieve? Europe? A place where from Italy to Sweden the police openly target minorities and racial profile? China? A place where minorities are tagged on their global credit system and possible trouble makers? Canada? Where indigenous people are constantly under attack by government policies? 

Ask yourself this. What has killed more. The past 200 years of school shootings and robberies or the past 200 years of police brutality, union busting, homelessness, and American imperialism. 

After you answer that question I want you to think who should *really* be armed.

No we're not, and there's no such thing as a nation of immigrants. The American people are a nation of Europeans united in their shared white ancestry, and shared history as settlers and conquerors of the American continent. A nation is a people unified in blood, and nothing else.

Italians were always considered white, and your story about grandfather is leftists anti-white bullshit made to deconstruct the concept of a European population group by pretending the definition has changed over time.

I'm actually Canadian-born, but Dansk was a good guess - I lived over there for a while so I know Danish (which is how I can understand Norwegian). I wish I was playing in WCL4! But no, I'm just back living in Australia (grew up there, which is why I got into cricket) and found some discount flights to Malaysia so figured I'd pop across for the tournament. Will try to do some coverage since the official ICC/Cricinfo options are usually pretty poor.

&gt; How far off these world competitions is Norway?

Norway are fairly down the list (for some reason cricket never took hold in the way it did for the Danes); last time they competed in a WCL tournament was a few years back in division 8 (which has since been culled by the ICC's policy of More Opportunities for Associates^^TM - but I digress). Good news for you and skirt-chasing mate though - they're due to compete in the [European regional qualifiers](https://www.icc-cricket.com/news/631096) later this year, which is part of the qualification pathway to the WT20 (and maaaybe also attached to WCL qualification, sometimes these things overlap but I have a hard time keeping it straight - potentially /u/styxwade knows since he's usually better informed). It's being held in the Netherlands 29 August - 3rd September and looks like it should be a pretty fun tournament so see if you can get down there!

International shipping. Sure, I can talk about that. You got a minute? 

I think my second biggest market would be Canada. Canada shipping is probably something I could figure out; but I doubt it'd be free. (If any of my hockey loving breathren want a game PM me and we'll work it out). 

After that would be the EU. I'm pretty sure the site is currently something that'd get me fined there, since I don't warn about cookies. Add figuring out how to deal with VAT on top of that and it's a bit of a hurdle for me. I recall Germany having rules about the content of games; particularly those that include reference to a certain political party that is frequently used as a villain. I can't promise that my products have FIGS translations, which I've heard is a regulatory issue in some countries, above also being a terrible user experience. That's another problem. I hear about regulations that may or may not exist, and I have no easy way of figuring out what might be true. I'm a one man shop with no ability to hire a lawyer versed in EU regulations. It's almost as if the EU wants to discourage foreign businesses from entering their territory. (TLDR: I know when I'm not welcome. The EU doesn't want US companies there right now, and I'm not in a position to bully my way in.) 

Australia and New Zealand I could probably do, but again it wouldn't be cheap. TBH I haven't looked too closely at it; if I hear enough demand from those people I'll take a look at what it'd actually entail.

A lot of the prices I pay for games come from the shipping from China to the US; I'm willing to wager enough 'defective' product has made it out of the factory to satiate that market for English language games. There's also a growing counterfeit market that's spilling over into North America these days. I hate to be presumptuous, but... it's probably coming from China. So it's in my interest to distance myself from that scene in general.

I sent a package to Brazil once. After being held in customs for a month the recipient got about half the items I sent. This has put me off of shipping to South America in general.

Finally, some games are published by different companies internationally, like books and movies. If my distributor or an offended publisher catches wind of me sending games across an ocean without authorization I'm likely to lose my ability to do business. I'd have to jump through quite a few hoops to secure my supply.

Ou simplesmente reescreva o conteúdo, acrescentando explicações e exemplos, não fazendo resumos (Menos ainda aqueles estupros de texto, em que você passa marca-texto amarelo (Ou sublinha) sobre umas partes e lê só elas depois, isso é um método que devia dar cadeia!).

Pra ter memória boa não tem outro jeito, tem que treinar a memória, se exigir lembrar alguns conteúdos as vezes, e... se forçar a situações assim não é tão simples, quando você tem que explicar pra alguém você se força a isso, mas em outras situações acho que não.

America was a more “moral” nation back then than now. There was segregation and a lack of women’s rights but a lot of that was happening everywhere else to varying degrees so it wasn’t seen as being as evil as it is now and/or the other stuff made up for it (in the eyes of the world). America was also *the* place for immigrants to go if they wanted prosperity and a better life. 

Nowadays America is viewed much more negatively both domestically and internationally. America is plagued with a ton of problems that most other western nations of equivalent wealth aren’t faced with. Massive prisons, high crime rates, and draconian punishments for crimes. Lack of universal health care. Extremely lax gun laws, large amounts of mass shootings, and a lack of legislative action addressing them. A huge increase in the amount of racist incidents over the last few years. The ever growing divide between rich and poor. All of these things make America be seen as much worse. 

Obviously you aren’t “racist” for liking America, but there are some pretty valid grievances that people have with America nowadays. I think patriotism can appear to be (and sometimes does actually involve) looking over the wrongdoings of a country, making the groups of people that are being wronged feel ignored and angry. I wouldn’t say that I love America. It does some things right but a LOT of things very wrong. All I’m saying is there are two sides to these things.

&gt; The Rolling Stones are an English rock group that formed in London in 1962. First popular in Europe, they quickly became successful in North America during the ""British Invasion"" of the mid-60s. Since then, their worldwide sales are estimated at more than 200 million albums. In 1989, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and in 2004, they ranked number 4 in Rolling Stone magazine's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. In 2008, Billboard magazine ranked the Rolling Stones at number ten on ""The Billboard Hot 100 Top All-Time Artists"", and as the second most successful group in the Billboard Hot 100 chart.

&gt; The group was formed by Brian Jones, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Ian Stewart, who met as schoolmates in Dartford, Kent. They took their name from a Muddy Waters song called ""Rollin' Stone Blues"", and made their live debut at London's Marquee Club (minus Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts). They start playing pubs and clubs around the city and suburbs. Bill Wyman joined later that year (the popular story is that he was asked because he had his own amplifier).

&gt; In January 1963, Charlie Watts  joined the Stones. The band gigged constantly, with residencies at venues like Ealing Jazz Club, Ken Colyer's Studio 51, and Eel Pie Island in Twickenham.  Their weekly performances at the Crawdaddy at Richmond's Station Hotel resulted in ecstatic press reviews, and in April Andrew Loog Oldham saw them there and signed them to his management company the next day. He started the ""Would you let your daughter marry a Rolling Stone"" press campaign, which set the tone for their career.

&gt; In May 1963, the Stones were signed to Decca Records by the same man who had turned down the Beatles. A month later ""Come On"", the first Rolling Stones single, was released, and reached number two in the U.K. charts.

&gt; The fifth member of the group, Brian Jones, left on 8th June 1969, saying that he wanted to form a new group. He was replaced by Mick Taylor, formerly in John Mayall's Bluesbreakers.

&gt; In 1971 the Stones, whose contract with Decca had expired, launched their Rolling Stones Records label.  In December 1974 Taylor left the group in order to pursue a solo career.  He was replaced in 1975 by Ronnie Wood.

&gt; Since Wyman left the Stones in 1993, the band has consisted of Jagger, Richards, Watts and guitarist Ronnie Wood. In studio and live performances, Darryl Jones (bassist) and Chuck Leavell (keyboardist) also serve as a regular contributors. 

&gt; In 2005, the band released ""A Bigger Bang"". 

&gt; On December 2, 2016, the band released their first studio album in over 10 days, entitled ""Blue &amp; Lonesome"" (2016) on the Polydor label. 

&gt; All the members have also undertaken solo projects of various kinds. The end. Read more on Last.fm.

* [No one factor describes Trump’s supporters. But an array of factors – many of them reflecting five major social psychological phenomena can help to account for this extraordinary political event: authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, prejudice, relative deprivation, and intergroup contact.](https://jspp.psychopen.eu/index.php/jspp/article/view/750/html)

* [Trump supporters are racist? Yes, say University researchers](http://www.citypages.com/news/whoa-trump-supporters-are-racist-yes-say-u-researchers/444020583)

* [Donald Trump is a legendary flip-flopper, but research shows his supporters don't care](http://utahpolicy.com/index.php/features/today-at-utah-policy/14450-donald-trump-is-a-legendary-flip-flopper-but-research-shows-his-supporters-don-t-care)

* [Two initial studies document that Americans blatantly dehumanize Mexican immigrants and Muslims; this dehumanization uniquely predicts support for aggressive policies proposed by Republican nominees, and dehumanization is highly associated with supporting Republican candidates \(especially Donald Trump\).](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167216675334?journalCode=pspc&amp;)

* [Trump supporters share the most fake news: study](http://comprop.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/polarization-partisanship-and-junk-news/)

* [A large majority of Clinton supporters \(70%\) say the Earth is warming mostly because of human activity, but just 22% of Trump supporters share that view.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/10/10/clinton-trump-supporters-worlds-apart-on-views-of-climate-change-and-its-scientists/) 

* [But new analysis of post-election survey data conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute and The Atlantic found something different: Evidence suggests financially troubled voters in the white working class were more likely to prefer Clinton over Trump. Besides partisan affiliation, it was cultural anxiety—feeling like a stranger in America, supporting the deportation of immigrants, and hesitating about educational investment—that best predicted support for Trump.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/white-working-class-trump-cultural-anxiety/525771/)

“This is what the Lord Almighty says... ‘Now go and strike Amalek and devote to destruction all that they have. Do not spare them, but kill both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.’” (1 Samuel 15:3)  
“In the same way also the men, giving up natural intercourse with women, were consumed with passion for one another. Men committed shameless acts with men and received in their own persons the due penalty for their error.” (Romans 1:27)  
“I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be silent.” (1 Timothy 2:12)

Yeah, people do have morals, y'know. Just cause there's something extreme in a religious book you do believe in, doesn't mean you have to follow it. Don't get me started on the Crusades, either. In fact, I just asked my Muslim friend if he wants to kill Jews, and he said: ""Why would I?""

Read my comment. my point was that crime rates are due to other factors (like the amount of poverty and resulting prevalence of gangs), not how strict or laxed gun laws are. 

&gt;Look at their crime rates before those laws and they will likely be much higher than they are today. 

The same is true pretty much across the board in the US.

&gt;By the way if the guns are coming in from other places with lax laws then doesn't that just mean ""gun control doesn't work as long as there are places with weak gun control""?

I could easy just ask why don't those areas with laxed gun laws have nearly as much crime? 

My point here is just that laxed gun laws does not mean more crime. It's other factors such as higher rates of poverty (and the resulting increase of gang activity etc.) that contribute to high crime rates. Crime rates and the strictness of gun laws is all over the place. What isn't all over the place is socioeconomic conditions and crime rates.

&gt;Places with less restrictive laws don't enact them because there is no need. 

I feel like you didn't understand what I was saying. I'd agree with that because I'm saying poverty and other factors are the driving force of crime, not laxed gun laws.

I can't help but look at it all within the view of Europe shifting from feudalism towards modern day capitalism and the Netherlands was really on the forefront of that. There's also a fair argument that there was always a greater sense of individualism and autonomy for the northern Dutch provinces due to their geography. Being a river delta, prone to flooding, the existence of the actual land depended on the people's cohesion in working together against flooding. Building dams, dykes and canals were necessary community projects upon which everyone's survival depended. Everybody has importance (every person is helpful in a flood). 

Also with few natural resources, their economies depended on mercantilism. The ideological schisms of the reformation as well as things like snti-senitism have no place in business, and limits opportunities to make bank. 

The reformation perhaps justified this individualism on a spiritual level. 

Charles V was also relatively lenient to Protestants, was himself born in the Spanish Netherlands (Ghent) and also had a strong paternal relationship with William of Orange (the silent). His son, Phillip II, on the other hand, wanted to destroy the increasing Calvinism in the low lands, with the moral support of the French King, and also sought to crush the now dire geo-political threat of a Protestant Britain.

To me, a lot of people try to hide the fact that they are very disappointed with Luke not being the master, mentor and hero they all know and love from the EU. From this disappointment comes a lot of resentment against the rest of the movies.

Not saying you are one of those people, but you did call it Luke's lightsaber. So in my mind, you were expecting the saber to return to Luke so he could save the galaxy... otherwise you wouldn't have been this disappointed by this turn of events.

But I'm happy you are open to reason. I was expecting a heated discussion with you telling me I'm not a real fan lol...

So what if I said people were set up to be disappointed... I don't think all the hate was what they were going for, but I do think they deliberately set up the movies for Luke to appear the great hero again.

But instead of being the Hero, Luke is now the mentor. He does confront Kylo in the end, but not really. He's just stalling, so the real hero's can escape. 

I know this is not a popular opinion, because a lot of people don't like Rey as the Hero, nor Finn for that matter. It all boils down to the same problem. Most problems with Rey I see discussed are immediately compared to Luke's journey in the OT. 

Rey isn't Luke! But she's not being given the chance to have her story fleshed out because at every turn she's compared to Luke.

And btw, Luke wasn't the only hero in the OT. Han, Leia, Chewy and Anakin were hero's in their own right, just not the focal point of the OT.

Same way Luke isn't the focal point in this story. He's not the Hero people wanted, but he is the mentor the Jedi need.
His single greatest advantage over the rest of the Jedi is the fact he had a 'normal' life before becoming a Jedi, instead of becoming a Padawan at a very young age not knowing or remembering his life before that. A normal life in which the good and the bad, the Light and the Dark, coexist in the same person, trying to balance them so life can be lived to the fullest.

In my opinion, this could be a direction they are taking the Force in. A new kind of Force religion or at least a shift in how the Jedi view their role in the galaxy... A new way for a more balanced galaxy...

Just my thoughts and hopes on this subject though... 

Anyway I'm glad they choose this route and not the superhero Luke one. We saw that already and I'm really curious how this story plays out. Loving it so far!

""But it's not a tax, it's a loan""

Yes, but the way it's structured causes problems.

another reason is economical. whenever the government starts subsidizing something, the prices of that something will increase exactly the same as the subsidy. for a practical example look at first home buyers grant which resulted in increased real estate prices effectively erasing any helpful benefits.

now this is just real estate, but imagine when there is free money to be had in all aspects of economic life. the 'velocity' of cash flow will increase and it means the purchasing power will stay the same, but the inflation will increase. again, the people will loose and the banks will win.

another reason is that this is communism. in communism, in eastern europe and russia, they tried to do the same thing by providing a 'job' for everybody. it was kinda illegal to be without a job and you would be institutionalized (taken away from your home and family and put into working camps or mental hospitals). so, everyone had a job, even if it meant you had nothing to do all day, just stare out the window or solve crossword puzzles at your desk. still you had to show up every day at work and you had a boss. it was very hard to get fired, but they would discipline you by other means. people led pointless lives and resorted to alcoholism and other self destructive, nihilistic behaviour.

and i know they are saying now this is not how it will be implemented in the west today, but i have my doubts about promises billionaires and politicians make. why didnt these politicians and billionaires rely on nanny state to provide for them? why take up a business and government career if they themselves believe in ubi? why didnt they want to be one of the many queing for government handouts? why didnt they choose this fate for themselves?

as an alternative i propose for everyone to study themselves, and to acquire skills steadily during the life, that he/she knows will be right down his/hers alley, given individual circumstances and capabilities, and then to implement those skills to run a small business(es).

not everything will be automated. far, very far from it.

False,KnowNothingtoKnowAll,,,,"Good comment. Russia is in reality a poor country with dying out population and economy size that of a Spain, which has about third of Russia's population. The only thing Russia tries to compete with the west is its military force. Also its political system is completely unaffected by its population at the moment.

They hope that US will back down from Europe and they will have a chance to push EU to accept economic deals that will be bad for EU and beneficial for Russia and do it with the gun pointed at their head. This is what they were doing as USSR with all eastern Europe, this is pretty much the only thing they were trying to achive throughout their history just after they got independent from Mongols inheritating their political system. 

Unfortunately this is regarded as normal in Russia as autocracy that becoming wealthy is by pointing the gun at someone else's head. This is what their political system requires their leaders to do. This is the model behaviour they got from the top of their society since Ivan the terible and Mongols before him. This is also the only way Russia can proceed unfortunately the way it is built. If they were to adopt democratic standards the whole country would split into smaller nation states with ethnic Russians being majority of course, but with other smaller nations in Caucase and possibly near Ural border coming back on the map after centuries of Russian oppression.

Russian people would probably be better of in a long run, being part of European common market, they would start to catch up with the west, just like all other ex-communist nations do in the EU. However people in Kremlin would lose their grip on power and wealth, so they would much rather sell their people the old catch phrase about the great Russia fighting the west, for which they the people should sacrifice their lifes, rather than give their people a chance to become successful. Majority of Russians unfortunately accept this deal. They hope and believe Putin will solve their problems bringing food to the table by pushing other nations with his military force, for which they, Russians, sucrificed significant portion of their lifes. This is the deal.

Of course not everybody in Russia think in this way. People in big cities all over the country understand that politics of military conflict has no future (especially when it comes to NATO which has greater force and can possibly annihilate all of their country.) They want to be part of the western community and to enjoy the freedom of western countries. Rise of Navalny, a political candidate from opposition is the best proof for that. However as long as we are stuck in the old generation way of thinking about Russia as ""a global power"" no change can occure. Younger generation will be more and more willing to let go of this illusion for the benefit of their own future.

Putin is the old generation and also psychopath, his comment after recent tragedy of dozens of people being burnt and buried alive in collapsing shopping center was that it is a shame... becasue they have this bad demography and now this happend. This is psychopaty at its highest. That is why he isn't bothered with people's life neither abroad neither in his country. Also his main point of narration os that Russia is strong, this is what wins him support, that is what he has to keep on proving to his audience at home, so they let him run the show. Now it is and will become harder and harder with economy crippled by sanctions to prove to people that Russia is strong. And he can't afford them changing definition of that strength from relative advantage over neighbouring countries to life quality within the state. Because after that change in mind set occures, he and his colleagues robbing their fellow country men will become public enemies. So he has to run the show, he has to prove his point acting provocative towards the west, invading his neighbors, poisoning ex-spies, so that west response and he can present himself as a defender of Russia, while pocketing all income and telling people they need to sacrifice in fight with the west or else... (they will end up as part of a community and free trade zone or even worse they will end up in it, like Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia... with over 100 billion Euros pumped into their economies over last 13 years in EU funds alone)

Of course not answering Russia from the western point of view is not an option. After all if they don't understand Ukraine is a seperate nation with their own freedom of choice about their furure, why would they understand it about any other nation? They don't and that is the problem, because within their country they have many oppressed nations, so this is the ""normal"" state of affairs. It isn't for us. So the response has to be adequate to Kremlin's moves, but not symmetrical. We are not playing game of domination with them, this is the illusion they would like to create, cos it would serve oligarchs interest to present skewed view to their public. Also this game can only end up in a way, no one is interested in, if it gets out of hand. 

So the way we response has to give Kremlin as well as Russian people clear message, you can either accept that you are a normal nation just like any other and become part of the community or you can try to play an empire, become ever poorer and essentially change into North Korea of Europe. The choice is theirs and let them figure out what they want to become and whether Putin is the guy leading them in the right direction.",True,False,1,1522665205,,1522730886,0,dwo27an,False,t3_88vvxv,False,t1_dwns5cs,/r/europe/comments/88vvxv/russia_to_test_fire_missiles_through_latvian/dwo27an/,,1525860529,2,False,True,False,europe,t5_2qh4j,public,

False,the_phet,,,,"I don't want to generalise and criticise scottish (or british) handymen, painters, plumbers,... but after 6 years here, there are a lot of amazing things in Scotland, and that's why I love it being here, but the quality of handymen, plumbers,... is shocking. It seems like the standards are super low, and people just accepts it. This is a conversation I have had with many other ""Europe main landers"". Cupboards are rarely properly fitted, same with kitchens. Everything seems a ""quick and cheap fix"". Floor tiles never perfect. It just seems that people here accepts lower standards.

I am from Spain. Yes, there are many things in Scotland better than Spain, but the quality of handymen and related jobs is not one them. My mum used to work in a company that sold and fitted kitchens and bahtrooms (she is now retired). And because I was young I used to work there sometimes, just helping them, moving stuff. The fitters, plumbers and electricitians they had were artists. Clients wanted everything fitted perfectly. 1mm gap anywhere and you had to refit the whole kitchen. Cupboard doors not being absolutely perfect, and you need new ones. Sinks not going perfectly into the ground, with 0 gap and nice shape, and you need to redo it. Tiles not being perfectly aligned, 0 gap, perfect match against the wall, and you had to refloor it. This company was not a ""high end"" company, by the way. It was a normal one in a middle class neighborhood. But that's what people expected when they bought a kitchen or a bathroom.

I don't know, I can give many examples in Glasgow. I remember when a broadband company came to my install the DSL. They just drilled a fucking hole, threw the cable in, and that's fucking you. Wires hanging, who cares? In my flat (West end glasgow) where the sink pipe meets the ground there's a decent size hole. And the shower cabin is the worse job I have seen in my life, with leaks everywhere. Everytime I tell my landlord to fix it (he actually is fast to fix stuff) he just drops some silicone and glue. The floor is composed of wooden tiles, and there are gaps between every row. I have been in many houses and flats, and it is always the same. Something like 2 or 3 weeks ago I needed a new fridge (obviously my landlord bought the cheapest one) but the guy who came to fix it, didn't give a shit. He just removed one, put the other, and that's you. I would expect as part of his job (as it is in Spain) to get a perfect fit, but here in Scotland, as long as it is there, and it works, who cares? My experience when speaking with other people, it is the same.

I think british (or scottish people) in general love less their property than in EU mainland. in EU mainland your house is everything about your life. It is your war chest. You want it as perfect as you can have it. Even poor people will generaly be proud home owners and keep as good as they can. In Scotland the attachment of people to their houses is not the same. Same with the building's close. My close is a fucking disaster. It is rough as hell. The street outside is actually nicer. People constantly throws shit around like if they were not living there. I just don't understand it. In Spain you will see people regularly cleaning their portion of the close, putting plants, having it nice. I don't know, it is part of your house.

The commonality of these events are of failures of eroding political systems.  These systems serve the powerful over the majority and are what actually buttress extremes.

Een mooie tuin, die ook goed is voor de bijen

Tuinieren In een mooie tuin kun je ongemerkt veel schade aanrichten. Een tour door het tuincentrum, met tips voor de bloemetjes en de bijtjes.

[Bijensterfte

De laatste jaren is de bijensterfte in Nederland in de winter afgenomen tot normale percentages (rond 10 procent). Wel is duidelijk dat de achteruitgang van de bijenpopulatie wereldwijd mede te wijten is aan insecticiden uit de groep van neonicotinoïden, die ook voor sierplanten en bloemen worden gebruikt.

Sommige tuincentra verkopen geen insecticiden meer met neonicotinoïden. Ook verkopen ze steeds meer gifvrije planten. Maar hoewel bijvoorbeeld Intratuin geen middelen met neonicotinoïden meer verkoopt, garanderen ze het niet voor planten en bloemen.]

Waar zouden de bamboestokken staan?”, vraagt Sytske de Waart. Ze gaat een bijenhotel maken en hoopt bij Intratuin aan de Koningsweg in Utrecht materialen te vinden. Bamboestokken met een doorsnee van 3 tot 8 millimeter en een vogelhuisje van hardhout, zonder splinters, dat dicht is aan de achterkant, zodat het een droog en comfortabel verblijf wordt.

Op zoek naar bamboe dus, en intussen laten we ons rondleiden door De Waart en haar collega Lara Peters van Milieu Centraal, om ons van praktisch milieuadvies te laten voorzien. Want een bijvriendelijke tuin is één ding, maar in elk hoekje van het tuincentrum zijn goede en minder goede keuzes te maken.

Zaden en bollen

Vlak bij de ingang hangen eindeloos veel zakjes met zaden. Het aanbod biologische bollen en zaden is de laatste jaren flink toegenomen, vooral voor in de moestuin. Het wemelt in het tuincentrum van de keurmerken. Het groene blaadje met EU-sterren garandeert teelt zonder kunstmatige bestrijdingsmiddelen, genetische modificatie en kunstmest. Het voordeel van zaden boven volgroeide planten is dat ze lichter zijn – dus minder energie voor vervoer. In de bollenteelt wordt nog veel gif gebruikt, maar ook hier geldt: het aanbod biobollen groeit.

Aarde en mest

Wie niet alleen wil zaaien maar ook oogsten, heeft aarde en mest nodig. Het schap met mest en ‘bodemverbeteraars’ is een broedplaats van verwarring. Wat zegt het dat een merk ‘Eco’ in zijn naam heeft? „Niets”, zegt Peters. Kunstmest is in elk geval geen milieuvriendelijke keuze. Beter is dierlijke mest en compost. Soms staat er ‘bio’ of ‘organic’ op de verpakking. Dat zegt niet veel meer dan dat het toegestaan is in de biologische landbouw. Het groene blaadje is er alleen voor landbouwproducten en daar hoort (pot)grond niet bij. De beste garantie voor milieuvriendelijke potgrond is het EU Ecolabel: in deze producten zit geen veen (turf), maar alleen organisch restafval, zoals kokosvezel. Helaas vinden we in deze winkel geen aarde met dit label. Tweede keus is aarde met een MPS-keurmerk: daarin mag niet meer dan een driekwart turf zitten, die bovendien zo gewonnen wordt dat het veen zich kan herstellen. Derde keus is potgrond met een RHP-certificaat: dat belooft dat de winning van veengrond niet ten koste gaat van natuurgebieden. Je kunt oude (pot)grond trouwens hergebruiken en oppeppen met zelfgemaakte compost.


Aanslag en onkruid

„Vegen, krabben, schrobben, wieden, schoffelen. Zie tuinieren als een work-out”, zegt Peters. Vlak bij het rek met ‘luie’ onkruidbestrijdingsmiddelen en producten tegen groene aanslag staan de voegenkrabbers, staalborstels en ander gereedschap dat de voorkeur krijgt boven chemische middelen. Glyfosaat, het omstreden gif dat door particulieren nog wel mag worden gebruikt, is bij Intratuin niet meer te koop. De vraag is of je überhaupt chemische middelen nodig hebt. „Neem om te beginnen zo weinig mogelijk tegels, kies bodembedekkers, dat scheelt wieden en het helpt bovendien om overtollig regenwater vast te houden en beter af te voeren.” Groene aanslag en mos kun je ook met heet water wegschrobben of wegbranden – er zijn speciale onkruidbranders voor in de handel. Een hogedrukspuit ruwt tegels zo op dat algen juist meer grip krijgen.

Slakken en mieren

Een beetje tuincentrum biedt planken vol middelen tegen slakken, luizen en andere beestjes. „Maar wie bijvoorbeeld slakken bestrijdt met metaldehyde, kan ook egels, vogels en honden vergiftigen”, zegt De Waart. „Er mag wel wat duidelijker op het etiket dat het alleen in de kas gebruikt mag worden.” Ferrifosfaat is minder slecht maar doodt ook slakken die het niet op je planten hebben voorzien. Er zijn talloze andere manieren om slakken af te schrikken. Ze hebben een hekel aan bepaalde planten en kruiden, zoals knoflook, dat ook vaak in strooisels zit.

Het lastige van al die korrels en poeders is vooral te ontdekken wat er nou precies in zit. „Toegelaten middelen krijgen nummers op de verpakking. Soms staat er geen nummer op, maar alleen ingrediënten”, zegt De Waart. „Als er geen nummers én geen ingrediënten op staan: laat het dan staan, want dan heb je dus geen idee wat je strooit.” De voor bijen schadelijke neonicotinoïden zijn weliswaar in de ban, maar welk ander gif is ervoor in de plaats gekomen? Zelfs het woord ‘natuurlijk’ zegt niets. Pyrethrine bijvoorbeeld is gemaakt van chrysant maar kan ook insecten doden die je wél in je tuin wilt. Lok liever natuurlijke vijanden zoals vogels. Lieveheersbeestje (tegen luis) en aaltjes (tegen naaktslakken) zijn online te koop.

Planten en bloemen

Nadat we de bamboestokken en een vogelhuisje hebben gevonden, komen we aan bij de planten. Tafels vol vroege bloeiers, klaar om, als het weer met Pasen een beetje meevalt, in de tuin of het balkon gezet te worden. Dit tuincentrum heeft een speciale tafel met planten die, volgens de labels, aantrekkelijk zijn voor bijen en vlinders. „Handig, maar je hóéft ze niet van deze tafel te halen als je weet waar bijen en vlinders van houden”, zegt Lara Peters. In elk geval iets met veel stuifmeel en nectar – zoals in het vroege voorjaar sneeuwklokjes, krokus, blauwe druif of bosanemoontjes – dat ook zonder label te vinden is.

Een advies voor de keuze tussen eenjarige of meerjarige planten geeft Milieu Centraal niet. „In het algemeen kun je zeggen dat wat lang meegaat beter voor het milieu is. Dus je moet ook een beetje huiswerk doen om planten goed te kunnen verzorgen en ze lang mooi te houden”, zegt De Waart. De meeste planten in tuincentra bevatten overigens nog steeds bestrijdingsmiddelen, bleek vorig jaar uit een steekproef van Greenpeace. Wie gegarandeerd geen gif wil, is aangewezen op de biologische hoek.

Meubels en potten

Het tuincentrum lijkt steeds meer op een woonboulevard. Een aanzienlijk deel van het vloeroppervlak is bestemd voor loungebanken en tuintafels. „Als je hout wilt, kijk dan bij voorkeur naar FSC-gecertificeerd hardhout”, adviseert De Waart. Het is duurzaam verbouwd en kan goed tegen regen en kou. Rotan, erg populair voor de tuin, groeit snel en is daardoor niet al te milieubelastend, maar het verweert veel sneller. Kunststof en metaal gaan lang mee, maar zijn moeilijk te repareren en aluminium vreet energie bij de productie. Peters geeft nog een tip: „Zoek naar tweedehands.”

Ook voor bloempotten geldt dat Marktplaats er vol mee staat. Een dilemma: stenen potten lijken beter voor het milieu, maar als je ze kapot laat vriezen, moet je weer nieuwe kopen. Bij de kunststof potten ziet Peters iets geks: een pot van ‘recyclebare’ kunstvezels. „Wat betekent dat? Ik zou niet weten waar ik met die pot naartoe moet als ik ’m wil laten recyclen.”

Bollen voor blije bijen

Natural bulbs verkoopt duurzame en biologische bloembollen en (groente)zaden. Alle bollen zijn vrij van neonicotinoïden, middelen die medeverantwoordelijk zijn voor de grote bijensterfte. Onder het kopje ‘bollen voor bijen’ staat ook aardpeer (topinamboer), de eetbare knol die met zijn vrolijke gele bloem een echte bijentrekker is. Verder is het nu vooral tijd om de zomerbloeiers te bestellen. Dahlia’s! Gladiolen!

False,TehMephs,,,,"I think people really over estimate how much removing guns from the equation will lower suicide rates.  I just had a pretty long discussion with someone on this sub about the topic, and the studies he linked me I’d already seen (in favor of the thought that guns directly equate to more suicide).  I point out that while it’s true some suicides can be attributed to in-the-moment decisions that can’t be undone, of which a gun can make for a real easy and quick way out, the number of incidents that might be prevented if guns just vanished wouldn’t be significant. 

Most of the studies claimed about .32-.38 per 100,000 fewer people committed suicide in states where mandatory waiting periods existed - this of course hinges on the idea that they didn’t have a gun beforehand anyway.  But if you look into what that number actually adds up to, in a small population state ~5mil, that’s about 15-20 lives saved at most.  In a high pop state like California 100 might be more accurate at a maximum.  Out of the 44,000 suicides annually, about 20k-ish are done with a gun.  This essentially might drop the overall number of suicides to 19,500 based off that number, of which the rest would be dispersed amongst other suicide methods.  (Note this is just an unscientific observation but based on some basic reasoning)

Now, if guns really were directly responsible for rising suicide rates, why are so many countries above us in suicides per capita or around the global average even where guns are heavily regulated?  

The global average is around 11.9 per 100,000.  We’re at 12-13 per 100,000.  Japan had an obscene suicide rate of 24 per 100,000 or so, and Sweden in the 18 range.  Australia is around the global average.  Many European countries are hovering around the global average.  How can we say guns unequivocally cause more suicides when the pattern doesn’t seem to correlate significantly to gun access?  And again, the studies that claim “greater risk” on the surface aren’t wrong, just massively sensationalizing how significant the increase is.  This is to say if somehow we got rid of guns, our suicide rate would still be over the average (11.7-12.7 instead of 12-13)

Gun control advocates purposefully include suicide stats on a discussion that is largely meant to be a homicide/crime discussion - they do this because their argument looks exceedingly weak without 2/3 of the generic “gun deaths” statistic thrown in.  And lately I’ve been seeing more and more people aggressively insist on including injuries to make it seem even scarier (as if all the other things that cause death don’t also cause non lethal damage or injury)

It’s just that suicide is a completely different monster from homicide and has no business being singled out from other methods of suicide to be injected into a discussion about involuntarily theft of life from another.  I also firmly believe that if someone is suffering so badly because of a medical condition or severe mental disorder and don’t want to live on, who the hell am I to tell them to stay and suffer?

He explains his motivation about the players he included in his WC


Burnley: cheap players, DGW and GW 35, he has defence and Barnes.
Newcastle: Kenedy, bargain, good form.


Southampton: Cedric 2DGW, to avoid relegation they need clean sheets and goals.


Monreal: he and mustafi both could be benched, Monreal has more attacking returns, can play in both formations Arsenal used this season.


Chelsea: He has Alonso and Willian, they can turn things around, . Both were a bit unlucky to have no return. 


Leicester: No European commitment, bench and staff celebrated like winning a cup final, so they seem very motivated and a team.


Kane: wait and see, not sure that he will start that much, Spurs have done great without him, one man doesn’t make the team, also looking at the cup final he maybe will get benched during the gameweeks to perform in the cup matches.


Man city: He doesn’t have city players, a lot of rotation, also still participating in the Champions League, maybe boring draw against Man Utd, Mourinho will beparking the bus, and both don’t want to lose


Brighton: He has got r=Ryan, though Dunk and Duffy also seem be good value. 2DGW. Should be motivated after lost against Leicester. Huddersfield failed to score in almost 50% of their matches. 
Stoke also not playing great, so look which opponents they have.


Captains: 33:
Kane: Beware of minutes
Salah beware of rest since champions league, Big Sam could toughen up defence after Man City,

False,Moprollems,yazidi,098c57ce-4d81-11e7-b9d3-0e3f23f65968,Literal Caliphate,"&gt;Actually, Sweden has taken more harsh measures against rape than pretty much every other country, and this includes a reporting system which you might call ""SJW"" if it didn't help your argument against immigration.

Such harsh measures as armbands that say [""please don't rape me""](http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/06/30/wristbands-stop-sex-attacks/) wow, so brave.

&gt;Secondly, gang rape (which has an incidence of about 0.0003% per year, or about 25 convictions whereas the immigrant population is close to 1,500,000) isn't even done primarily by immigrants: 40% were committed by foreign-born individuals, with the rest being white native Swedes.

So 40% of all rape in the country is committed by, what, 14% of the population? Secondly are you defining ""foreign-born"" as being *born outside of the country* or *born to non-whites*, because simply being born in Sweden does not mean you're White and the crimes you commit should be considered committed by the White community.

Secondly since your link isn't even in English I had to find my [own stats](https://muslimstatistics.wordpress.com/2015/03/19/sweden-77-6-percent-of-all-rapes-in-the-country-committed-by-muslim-males-making-up-2-percent-of-population/)

&gt;Is your actual argument here that the Swedish government is deliberately allowing people to immigrate because they like their people being raped? If so, that's pretty fucking stupid.

Well when their cousins to the west feel guilty over reporting rape because their precious migrants would [get deported](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3528236/Male-Norwegian-politician-raped-asylum-seeker-says-feels-GUILTY-attacker-deported-man-suffer-Somalia.html) and you also have the rather unfortunate case of that singer who gave a remix of Sweden's anthem (to include interracial sex) getting brutally raped and killed, I'd say on some level the Swede's love the horde of third worlders and all the rape and murders they bring with them.

&gt;By doing what? Cheering them on?

\&gt;Implying the anti-war side does anything more than cheering anyways.

At most you had some Anons call out targets for Russian bombing runs, which officially means they've done more for Assad than anti-war lefties have done for stopping the damn thing.

&gt;People are going to migrate whether or not the ""left"" squeals ""refugees welcome"".

Not if they're met by guards and physical border walls.

&gt;This is what people tend to do when their homes are destroyed, or when there's a big enough difference in living conditions. The question is what you do with the migrants when they arrive.

No, that's assuming they can just waltz on in, that they *have* to. They don't.

&gt;The ""left"" and liberals tend to see them with sympathy, but the difference is the left sees migration as an anomaly, sees the root cause of the migration crisis, and wishes to eliminate that root cause, whereas liberals see migration as some fundamental reality and do nothing but pat themselves on the back over how virtuous they are for letting migrants in.

The ""wish to eliminate that root cause"" reminds me of an article I read by a fellow Catholic which tried to win the altright over or show its superiority to it by saying that Catholicism ""connected with eternity"" or some other nonsense which is ""so much more superior"" to actively seeking to create a culture with some pride and dignity, it's argument completely ignored the ""AltRight"" and its actual beliefs and essentially boiled down to, ""Oh all those Cathedrals you want to preserve and pride in Church history you love? Uhhh... just ignore that. Something something eternity. Yeah, we're offering you connection with the eternal, whatever that means, and some greater achievement even though we've shown ourselves to be incapable of fucking doing something as small as preserving a single Church.""

In short you can whine about ""root causes"" but the war wont end in a day and can't be undone. Guards and deportation campaigns are faster and more efficient than some idiotic hope that Syria can get its shit together.

&gt;But you, being so far up this nonsense, seem to legitimately buy into the idea that both the ""left"" and liberals are intentionally intensifying the refugee crisis not because of sympathy for those fleeing war-torn lands, but as some ideological means to intentionally attack the white population of the country.

They're willing to give migrants lenient sentences for rape and other crimes because they *want* them there, the white population is in decline, and many left leaning parties have already understood that you don't have to do things like actually have appealing ideas: just let in the fucking third-world hordes and give them a hefty dose of welfare and they'll vote you in constantly, or if they can't, their children will.

Anti-immigration parties generally grow to be some of the largest in Europe, yet no other party in Europe will openly or actively associate with them , that's because getting more migrants is a goal in and of itself for them.

&gt;Even as you acknowledge the root cause of this migration pattern, you still try to wind cause &amp; effect into a knot.

No, I offer a practical solution beyond vague armchair philosophizing over ""the evil nature of war"": shut down the border. Arrest people trying to cross by land. Sink boats that try to arrive by sea. You simply have to sink one, just **one** boat for everyone to get the message that they aren't welcome.

&gt;The sexual abuse case in Rotherham began in the 1980s, way before the recent refugee crisis, and pretty much all of these UK rings have involved Pakistani men, who aren't at all the main group in the recent immigration wave. Why Pakistani men? Almost certainly, it has to do with organized crime and drug trade between the UK and Pakistan, which is the UK's main source of heroin. Generally, drug cartels are a hive of the worst, most degenerate sort of people, and cases of organized child trafficking are nearly always found to be connected to organized crime groups with connections to the drug trade. At least, that's how it was in the UK with previous similar child abuse rings.

Do you think it matters, *at all* why the men were doing what they were doing? Fact was they predominately targeted Sikh and Christian girls, but even that's irrelevant to the main fucking point: the government knew, the police knew, the media knew. They all fucking knew. In fact they went as far as arresting fathers trying to rescue their daughters because they were ""disturbing the peace"", and they did that because they were afraid of *the left* squealing that they were racists, that they were targeting the Pakistani community, and ruining the ""wonderful"" diversity of Britain.

That's the culture the left created: just offer up our people on a fucking platter to foreigners because it's better than upholding the fucking law.

&gt;Do you have a case to make that these sorts of things will increase if more Syrian refugees are allowed into the country?

Anecdotally one need only look at events such as the New Year's sex attacks, or the fact that upon Japan accepting *just* 27 migrants, one of them had to be deported *instantly* because he raped a Japanese woman.

Wouldn't even know where to start.

&gt; You are describing anti-Vanguardist stance, the one supported by the people who defend spontaneous revolution - and suggest waiting.
&gt; 
&gt; Vanguard, on the other hand, is supposed to be consciously created. I.e. no waiting for someone to ""sweep in"". You are the one who will ""sweep in"".

Again, though, kind of requires a large number of similarly minded, armed folks.

&gt; They will. But we still shouldn't be using the incorrect term that does not describe reality.

Good point, no use adding to it.

&gt; Except they don't really have a solution. I.e. they can't keep power while relying on popular support.

Also a good point, any far right governments will still collapse. That'll hardly be a walk in the park for all involved, though.

Yeah I mean doomed to eating shit for a while, the only way that could be avoided is if it collectively decided to go full communist yesterday, and devoted itself to mitigating the oncoming crisis.

Fair enough.

Yes and it silly to blame the PLC for it. It's the equivalent of today's Poles blaming the European Union for people leaving the country and choosing to live abroad. It is their choice to leave Poland. Other EU countries have higher standards of living and it is easier to start a family there. But polish nationalist say it is bad and it is hurting our country, because the next generation of Poles that was born abroad is assimilating fully into those communities thus they feel more like the German, English, French and so on. 

Back then it was similar. Poland was the richer and more powerful partner of the union, so the lithuanian nobility started to polonize themselves by choice so they could achieve that polish standard of living. If you want to blame anyone, blame your ancestors that they only thought about their own personal gains and not the future of their heritage/language. 

But you can't blame PLC for it, just like you can't blame the EU for the mass migration. 

&gt; It's just that Poland had way more power and influence in PLC than Lithuania. 

One of criteria of getting a seat in the Sejm was the size of population in the province. 

&gt;Shortly after the Union of Lublin (1569), at the turn of the 16th to 17th century, the Commonwealth population was around 7 million, with a rough breakdown of 4.5m Poles, 0.75m Lithuanians, 0.7m Jews and 2m Ruthenians.

It's no wonder Lithuania had less power than Poland, but again it's no different from the current EU situation. 

Should we now start calling the EU ""pretty shitty"" because Germany has higher population and thus more seats in the European Parliament, and because of it is harder to convince them to do something? I heard that argument before (again from polish nationalist) and it equally doesn't make sense just like saying that PLC was shitty because of the same reasons. 

If it was shitty for anyone it was for the Ruthenians that didn't have any vote at all and were ruled over by Lithuanian and Polish nobility that really didn't care about them. Which later resulted in catastrophic Khmelnytsky Uprising - the treatment of the Cossacks during that period was just atrocious. 



And let's not kid ourselves - Lithuania joining the PLC was the only chance for them to survive during that period. GDL border was indefensible considering the modest resources it had. (The mistake 2nd Polish Republic will sadly repeat) Lithuanian nobility was ruling over a majority of non-Lithuanians that were second rate citizens in GDL (and unfortunately in the PLC) growing more hostile over time. If GDL wanted to survive it had to form a union with much stronger Poland (which obviously also benefited from the union). 

The more arguments I hear about evil PLC destroying Lithuania the more ridiculous they get. But well, that's human nature, trying to blame everyone for their troubles just not themselves.

That's because Russians don't care about flaming, they do it without exception constantly. They will report you if they blame you for losing the game. They report each other constantly when they lose. Every single game I see it. They will pick a hero into your mid when you took it first, and the team will instantly tilt you and turn on you no matter what you do from that point forward. They will pick Tiny so they can solo on whatever lane they want, and if you go to their lane, they'll toss you to death. If you complain about it, they'll get tilted even further and report you for complaining. So you have actual people who deserve those reports reporting you instead, when you don't.

Murray acknowledges that oppression of minority groups has played a role in European overepresentation.  To copy from another post I made in a different thread:

Specifically, he highlights how achievement among Jews rapidly increased in response to the gradual removal of unfair policies the excluded Jews from mainstream society starting around the 1850's.

Of course, it's possible things could have de-escalated, but that's less likely compared to the large-scale war we ended up getting.

&gt;To go back to your earlier point, the assassination wasn't the important point. It was the fact that one nation choose to declare war on the other for whatever reason, and as a result alliances and defensive pacts were engaged that eventually grew into the conflict.

The assassination is the direct cause of the deterioration of the relations between Serbia and Austria, which caused the war.  Without the assassination, Austria never sends Serbia a list of demands that it can't satisfy, war between those two doesn't break out, and Russia doesn't step in.

It's funny the way people assess countries with stats because so many of the differences that mattered to me were much more subtle and intrinsic to me as a person. 

In the US, I've been told by a lot of friends and people I barely know that I'm intimidating. I'm a stereotypical ""intellectual."" I'm opinionated and not afraid to challenge people. Not in a dick way, but that's just how I was raised. My point is, most people interpret me and treat me like I'm smart first and foremost. 

With that being said, I'm a 5'9"" blonde, white girl with somewhat of a valley girl inflection. I laugh a lot, I do the so-called idiot toothy smile often when I talk. It's just how I present myself. Even so, in the US, that doesn't seem to take away from the aforementioned traits I mentioned. I think the only people who treat me like a vapid girly girl are older men (like 60+) and that's it. 

When I was in Europe, I had to go to GREAT lengths even when I was in an intellectual environment to be taken seriously. The contrast was jarring. I felt like I had to constantly filter my basic personality and mannerisms in order for people to listen to me or look at me like I was more than an idiot, and in some cases, slut.

One of my best friends to this day, who is a highly educated and very liberal Western European admitted to me way later on that he initially only started hanging out with me because he assumed I'd be easy. One time I was sleeping over at the house of a guy who I'd hungout with a few times, who again, was highly educated and very liberal, and I awoke to him saying, I shit you not, ""come on American girl"" and he forced himself inside of me even though I'd made a huge effort that night to tell him I wasn't DTF.

&gt;Real GDP is the measure of overall economic strength. I never argued that it decreased inequality. 

Hmmm. I seem to remember you arguing that capitalism did. But whatever. Yes, it is a measure of overall economic strength, but it doesn't measure how many people who are leaving in fear of crime. It doesn't measure how many are in poverty. So, by your logic, it's useless because it doesn't REALLY measure strength. How can a country be strong when it has a bunch of people in poverty?

&gt;What I'm explaining is that, if you want economic prospects to grow at all, you have to have a capitalist system.

Yes, I agree with that. But I am saying that there are certain problems that government is better at solving than capitalism is. And unless you just want to ignore those problems, you should go the government route to solve them.

&gt; Yes, you have to do additional things to ensure that poorer populations are at least getting something. Wealth redistribution is not one of those things.

No, it literally is. It LITERALLY is. We cannot have a conversation if you do not want to deal in reality. The poor population is literally GETTING SOMETHING. They get housing, food, money, etc. This is just a simple fact unless you change the definition of ""getting"".

&gt;Wealth redistribution is a feel good election-winning response for Republicans that, at best, is zero sum and does nothing, and at worst, puts more money into the hands of people who suck at using it, where they flush it down the financial drain and spend it on things that aren't productive to our country's economic prospects.

That is also false. They spend it on food and other useful goods. It is found that things like foodstamps have a multiplier effect. That is to say, the ultimate economic impact of food stamps is a net gain because of all the jobs and extra business transactions it creates. On the other hand, extra money kept in the hands of the wealthy is more likely to do nothing but accrue in a bank account. 

&gt; Once again, we're talking about the rights of slaves and even the most crooked of prisoners. Having all of the basics doesn't mean you're out of poverty. 

Wow, you really must be losing to pull out this slave argument. Yes, they have the rights of slaves. Just like you do and every rich person does. However, like you and rich people, they have MORE rights than slaves. So to compare them to slaves because of one similarity is a tad disingenuous.

&gt;""Out of poverty means you have choices --

NO, we already established the definition. You are trying once again to change it. It has nothing to do with ""choices"" and nothing to do what the crime rate is in your area. Consequentially, people who are poor do have choices. Just because you get food stamps, that does not mean you're living in government housing. Just because you live in government housing that doesn't mean you don't make some of your own money and have CHOICES about what you can do with it. Please stop with this equivocation. Poverty is not all of the things you are defining it as.

 &gt; ""Yeah, your pipes may burst in the Winter... that's such a pitiful and disgusting standard of people not being in poverty.""

Facts don't care about your feelings man. They are out of poverty by the supplemental poverty rate. This fact just upsets you so you are trying every kind of trick to ignore it, but you CANNOT.

&gt; I believe I said the complete opposite...

OK, so you just totally ignored how i responded. Yes, we spend more, but we still do not have a socialist healthcare system. Ours is the most capitalist-oriented one and we spend the most overall when you look at private and public spending together. This shows that a market-based system does not work, and as I stated, it has worse outcomes. 

&gt; A classic case of not knowing the difference between ""access"" and ""care.""  Venezuela provides free access...

LOL. Why the hell are you bringing up Venezuela! At least bring up a country that is SOMEWHAT similar to us. Either way, you are talking about only a few facets concerning healthcare. When one looks at our overall healthcare system, it fares worse than others.

&gt; ...Lots of healthy people don't feel theneed to see doctors because they take care of themselves, not because they're afraid of the cost.

""Poll 44% of Americans skip doctor visits because of cost"".

https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2018/03/26/poll-44-of-americans-skip-doctor-visits-due-to-cost/#4fdbada16f57


&gt; But even if you consider that cost, that cost is going to exist whether you're talking about a private or a public system. It just gets hidden in a public system, but it's there and every bit as much, because the cost of a doctor is based on the supply and demand of doctors, whether it's government you're talking about or a private system.

But as we established, Americans are spending more on cost ANYWAY. Public AND Private. Other countries not only spend less publically, they spend less privately also.

&gt; Medicare? Medicaid? Those are public systems.

No, you know what I mean. I am talking single-payer. Universal healthcare.

&gt; It's like the all expenses paid vacation to everywhere you want in the world...

Yes, we would pay higher taxes. But the data shows we would be paying that anyway, but if we use socialist systems, we'd get more bang for our buck. So once again, even when you take taxes into consideration education, healthcare, and welfare fare better under socialist systems and fare worse under a capitalist system.

You have had to bend over backwards, change the meanings of words, and deny reality to try to deny this, but it is a fact that all things come with benefits and costs. When it comes to these matters, the benefits outweigh the costs as compared to free market systems. Simply repeating the costs over and over again does not change this.

&gt; There would be a literal civil war if you told people they were going to pay what Europeans already pay in taxes and for commodities.

OK, so you are saying if conservatives didn't get what they wanted at the voting booth, they'd start a war? This is what it has come to? We can't be socialist at all because you and your friends are going to get violent if we do? Wow, now I know you've lost.

False,Rhyseh1,,,,"Back when I was living at my parents house, my parents rescued two dogs from the local pound. This started with a female dalmation x staffy (just shy of a year old), she was originally named J-Lo because she used to ""sing"" in her kennel. We quickly changed this to Jada. Jada was a curious dog, head like a staffy, size of a dalmation but thick and muscular like a staff. Jada is affectionately known as ""the bulldozer"" and is an absolute sweetheart with people and quickly bonded with Mum.

Around 9 months later my mother rescued another dog, this one a female mastiff x great dane x hound x staffy of about 12 months. This one named Tully. Tully was quite possibly the single most intelligent and agile dog I've ever seen. Combine this with her natural power and STRONG hunting instincts, she was incredible. She once snatched a Kookaburruh (Australian bird) out the sky.

Tully was also one hell of a jumper. We had six foot colorbond fences that we had to make taller to stop her just jumping and trying to eat the neighbors cats/rabbits/etc. 

Tully fast became ""my dog"". When we would go for hikes as a family we would take the dogs and Tully was ever walking close behind me, constantly looking to me for direction, just a step behind. If I would sit down of an evening she would curl up at my feet. Basically if I was around, Tully wouldn't be far away.

Anyway the first year the dogs were best friends. They slept together, ate together, played together and basically were inseparable partners in whatever mischief they would get up to while everyone was at work.

At around this time (a year after the arrival of Tully) my parents went on a European holiday for a couple of months. My Sister, her Husband and I agreed to look after the dogs while they were away. I worked long hours at the time, so having my Sister and husband around to help was great!

Around a week or two into my parents being away the issues between the two dogs started. They would fight one another and not just nips and noise, we're talking bites and blood here. I think we all ended up with incidental holes when trying to separate then. I ended up with some in my forearm and the back of my hand when we were separating them (don't wrap your arm around a dogs chest in an attempt to pull them away from another dog who is in the process of trying to seriously bite them).

Anyway there were a few incidents, but they always started when my sister was looking after them. To date there had never been an issue when I was present, I had rushed in when I heard something start, but I was never there for the beginning of an incident... So I thought it must be something to do with my Sister somehow.

Weeks go by, no more incidents, everything is back to normal. Anyway my parents were due back from their holiday the next day. I wanted them to be able to take it easy when they got back. So, as I had done several times before in recent weeks, I pulled out the edger and mower to trim the lawns.

I had done this several times before over the last few weeks, each time the dogs have been out in the yard, calmly watching me from a safe distance. 

This time though.... as I start the edger Jada starts going mental at it. I tell her off.... no effect, she's red zoned. As is usual, Tully is only a few feet away from me and Jada turns towards her in her red zoned frenzy. Tully quickly reacts and these two, powerful dogs are quickly about to come together in a bloody showdown.

Quickly I grasp both of their collars and haul them up so their front legs can't get any purchase. I hold them there, a little of a foot apart as they gnash at each other... I start hauling them back the 10 to 20 meters to the back verandah.

Jada is in full panicked ""fighting for her life"" mode, biting anything her jaws come in contact with. Some these objects included my leg and my stomach.

So I hauls these thrashing hounds up the backs stairs of the verandah, just a few meters from a door I can use to separate these two dogs. I don't  know how I planned to open it, but I never found out. 

When I came around the corner at the top of the landing, Jada slipped her collar and the two hounds came together. Tully quickly latched onto the thick skin on the side of Jada's head. Jada tried to latch onto Tully's head, but didn't quite get the same purchase as her more athletic counterpart. All the same she managed to grab onto Tully's cheek... as well as something else...

That something else was my left hand. My pinky finger was firmly nestled in the crushing rear molars of Jada's maw. If you've ever seen a powerful dog chew chicken wings before, you will know that familar crunch sound that filled my ears.

Strangely I don't really remember there being much pain. Just a cloud of calm logic telling me I needed to get my finger out of there before it gets ripped off. All the same I was screaming loudly, hoping someone would hear and come help me rescue my digit.

While this cold calm was settling, Jada and Tully were, ripping at each other with powerful head shakes, like dogs do when playing tug of war... Only Jada wasn't just ripping at Tully, she was also ripping at my finger. As she would rip I would try and go with her, desperately trying to keep my finger attached.

At this point my finger was compressed into a space around 2 to 3mm in thickness. For my imperial readers out there... Sweet fuck all space.

Just as I was beginning to think I would lose my finger, Jada's jaws opened enough for me to pull my hand free. SUCCESS!

In response to my calls for help my neighbor soon arrived to a bloody mess, both mine abd the dogs. There was little that could be done to separate these two. We tried the hose, buckets pieces of wood. In the end Jada's fight instinct changed to flight. So I grabbed Tully's hind quarters in a kind of bear hug and waited for them to let go. Once that happened Jada ran inside and I separated the two of them. One inside, one outside.

My neighbor took me to the hospital and my sister took the dogs to the vet. They just need a few stitches. Me on ther hand...

My pinky was SHREDDED, it was in a curious state of being held in place by a few strands of skin and, fortunately, the tendons. The webbing between my fingers was torn open, the internal tear between the fingers was about 4cm deep (an inch and a half). The surgeon almost cut the finger off, but fortunately he saved it.

The next day my parents arrived home to the dogs in the vet and me in hospital. WELCOME HOME!

It took four surgeries and countless hours of physio over the next 2 years to gain back 60% of the movement and 80% of my grip strength. My left forearm wasted away crazily, you would be amazed how much your pinky contributes to your grip....

Moral of the story: if you are near a dog fight, keep your hands away from the pointy end.

Wow that was alot longer than I intended it to be. 

For anyone wondering the dogs stayed with the family, we spent a fortune trying to train/solve the problem. The two dogs just both wanted to be boss over the other. In the end we could'nt get them to be nonviolent toward each other so we built separate areas for them in different outdoor areas and kept them fairly separate from one another. At night they were both in with the family, but confined to their beds.

TL;DR: the family dogs got into a fight. I got my finger practically bitten/ripped off and required major reattachment and reconstruction surgery.

Brassica oleracea is a plant species that includes many common foods as cultivars, including cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, Brussels sprouts, collard greens, savoy, kohlrabi, and gai lan.

In its uncultivated form, it is called wild cabbage, and is native to coastal southern and western Europe. Its high tolerance for salt and lime, and its intolerance of competition from other plants typically restrict its natural occurrence to limestone sea cliffs, like the chalk cliffs on both sides of the English Channel, and the windswept coast on the western side of the Isle of Wight.

Wild B. oleracea is a tall biennial plant that forms a stout rosette of large leaves in the first year.

False,unkn0wnedd,,,,"Doesn’t make me feel dirty.  Why would Putin use a chemical weapon obviously traceable to Russia? To send a message possibly, but I don’t buy that.  Just think about WHY Russia would use a distinctly Russian agent and why Western European nations all immediately come to the conclusion that the chemical was “of a type developed by Russia” (specific wording in many statements).  Yet, despite the fact that they haven’t conclusively said it was Russia or provided proof, that is the narrative.

The Novichok agent was developed by Soviets and was under their control in the 90s.

Are we really ignorant enough to believe that any foreign power couldn’t have obtained the agent and used it to frame Russia?

(Skripal was a double agent after all, undoubtedly one of many)

Personally, I have no idea whether it was Russia or not.  I don’t even lean one way or another, I’m clueless.  I am just frustrated with the fact that many see it as fact that Russia perpetrated the attack.  And that the attack is being used to further a narrative of Russian aggression.

You can learn a lot when thinking about WHY people do the things they do.  Putin may have had something to gain by poisoning Skripal, but it’s hard to imagine that he was THAT important of a target, given the repercussions against Russia for it.

I’m mainly concerned about governments pushing the narrative of Russian aggression as it seems to be setting the stage for war.

But I guess it's hard to expect Turkey to not give a boost to islamists when it's slowly turning islamist as well.

You know, the reason that many Europeans sort of close their eyes when it comes to PKK and their links to YPG is that we are so allergic to radical islamism that we tend to support/look leniently at any group that rejects this philosophy. This makes it hard (and impossible for some) to symphatise with Turkey in this conflict and on the contrary it makes it hard to not symphatize with YPG as they were the ones fighting with the ultimate islamist group - ISIS.

**(Habuta's post)**

*A lot of misconceptions here. Firstly to understand the reason why people freak out when a non-black person says the ""n-word"", you can read about etymology of the word and stuff but you can also simply look at the definition of the word here :*

*&gt;Slang: Extremely Disparaging and Offensive. a contemptuous term used to refer to a person of any racial or ethnic origin regarded as contemptible, inferior, ignorant, etc.*

*The important part here is ""contemptible"" and ""inferior"". The word has been mostly used to dehumanize black people. So when a black person says it, it is hard to think that the person is inferiorizing and dehumanizing themselves. That being said, most black people are reluctant to use the word in public anyway. Also many black people got intro trouble for using the word as well, some examples : Rapper Nas, Andrew Harrison, Colin Kaepernick and im sure you can find more if you want.*

*Also by the same logic white people can't be racist against white people unless they have mental issues. You can call white people trash, idiots etc. that doesn't make you racist against white people. Racism by definition means that you see :*

*https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/racism*

*&gt;Prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior*

**(My response)**

The way people use slang or slurs don't always relate towards the original or 'true' definition. (Hypothetical) If someone annoyed me and I called them a 'fаg', that doesn't necessarily mean I'm calling them gay, I'm just calling them a 'fаg' because it's crude and offensive.

&gt; That being said, most black people are reluctant to use the word in public anyway.

You're not being specific enough, I would argue it would depend more on culture rather than race. I'm sure an upper-class European black man is much more reluctant to use such vocabulary over a poor African American - they're both black, but the culture is different.

&gt; Also many black people got intro trouble for using the word as well, some examples : Rapper Nas, Andrew Harrison, Colin Kaepernick and im sure you can find more if you want.

These anecdotes are incomparable to the general societal consensus of how the word can be acceptably used. 

&gt; Also by the same logic white people can't be racist against white people unless they have mental issues.

While someone of a certain race might be more reluctant to being racist agains't 'their own', that doesn't mean they can't be racist.

100% sure we do.

You thought it was going to be a steaming pile of shit with extra shit in your mouth? I guess you want the economy to slow down, trade to buckle, goods to be more expensive, farming crises. I didn't know you were someone who enjoyed those things, funnily enough its not what I hear from many leavers who actually are starting to regret there choice. 

&gt; No we don't. The public has no input at all on when General elections are called.

Not true GE and opinion polls actually have a close connection, but we also don't need to trigger one because we have 5 year fixed terms anyway. The point is when we want a change or when we feel we have made a mistake in our vote, we have a option of change every 5 years. 

&gt; No. We have already eliminated the option of remaining.

Literally haven't even the EU saids we can stop article 50 if we want.

&gt; There won't be a future vote (and nor should there be) but, if there was, the only logical option would be to vote on 'flavours' of Leave only.

I am sure that is what they said in 1972? But here we are. No there should be vote and its clear we need one. how can you not see that? 

&gt; No. It would be the very opposite of being ""democratic""

Well no ""Demos"" meaning people and cratic meaning ""rule"" means that a referendum would be democratic anyway. The only non-democratic thing is to stop another vote.

False,-Soen-,lazio,,Lazio,"Penso di poterti essere d'aiuto, in qualche modo.

Non sono uno studente di Storia, ma frequento Economia, sono al secondo anno. Devo ammettere che al quinto anno di liceo la mia situazione era abbastanza simile alla tua: amo Storia alla follia, ma le prospettive di lavoro che si prospettavano da una laurea in Storia erano o legate all'insegnamento - che, avendo una madre insegnante, sconsiglio fortemente, almeno qui in Italia: per quanto la consideri una professione nobile, le condizioni odierne del docente medio qui sono miserabili; non ne vale assolutamente la pena - oppure mi sarei dovuto accontentare di qualche lavoro che con la Storia in sè c'entra relativamente poco, come il giornalismo. Sta cosa non mi andava proprio bene, e di conseguenza ho ripiegato su Economia, essendo la mia seconda scelta in ogni caso.

Questo semestre è successa una cosa particolare: ho cominciato il corso di Economic History(sto frequentando il corso di laurea in inglese). La materia è fantastica, ti da gli strumenti per analizzare praticamente almeno tutta la storia europea da un punto di vista economico dal 1750 ad oggi. Ed è un corso relativamente basilare sulla materia. Mi è piaciuto talmente tanto che ne ho parlato spesso con l'assistente del mio professore, che la insegna ad Oxford(!). Lui mi ha aperto un mondo, nel senso che mi ha fatto capire che una carriera in Storia Economica è fattibilissima, il problema sta tutto nel fatto che in Italia un corso di studi incentrato su di essa non esiste, nè ha molto peso su come può vederti un qualcuno a cui porti il curriculum. Mi ha messo in contatto con un suo studente che precedentemente ha studiato a Tor Vergata(dove studio io). Dopo aver parlato con entrambi, sto seriamente prendendo in considerazione la decisione di andare a frequentarla a Lund, in Svezia (buona università, retta nulla per i cittadini europei). Sta settimana spero di riuscire a strappare al mio prof di EH una mezz'oretta per parlare anche con lui della cosa.

Insomma, questo è il mio consiglio: non fermarti a Storia nel senso accademico. Se ti piace Economia, ti strasuggerisco di provare Storia Economica, e sono qui per eventuali domande, in caso abbia suscitato una qualche curiosità. Se preferisci cose come Archeologia o Sociologia, ci sono corsi che uniscono le due materie. Non fermarti solo a quello che ti sto dicendo io, però: fai le tue ricerche, e trovati il percorso che secondo te può appassionarti di più. Il fatto di unire la Storia ad altre materie aumenta di gran lunga il numero di professioni disponibili. Storia Economica, ad esempio, ti permette comunque di intrapendere buona parte delle carriere disponibili ad un economista normale.

Una cosa importante che devi considerare però è che se scegli una di queste strade, difficilmente troverai un corso di qualità nelle vicinanze, se lo riesci a trovare in primis. Quindi prova a pensare a come ti sentiresti a studiare all'estero e giudica di conseguenza. E impara bene(Livello C1) almeno l'inglese. Non puoi capire quanta gente conosco, purtroppo, che si rifiuta di farlo.

TL;DR: Il fatto che Storia non ti dia il pane è una cavolata bella e buona, dipende tutto da come e in che modo la fai.

You realize that the 80s and 90s democratic party is basically defined by neoliberalism right?

&gt; it doesn't mean neoliberals truly represent liberal ideals

You realize neoliberalism as an economic philosophy sits further to the left than liberalism right? 

I actually mean no offence by this, but you are throwing around these terms with colloquial meanings but neoliberalism is an economic school of though but not a exactly social school of thought, while liberalism has incredibly specific and different economic and social meanings. In fact liberalism in the economic sense is so different from what modern liberal believe in economics wise (or really have since the 30s when the American liberals pretty much abandoned it but american conservatives have always agreed on some form of economic liberalism to some degree) its rather hard to reconcile. Both economic systems work towards the goal of a liberal society in a social sense but they assume different economic ways to get there. 

Also liberal is not synonymous with left wing. I know it gets used colloquially like that, but liberalism is seen as a rather center left political philosophy in general.

This is based on the fact that English speakers take considerably longer to learn it than most other languages, and that seems to be borne out by the experiences of people from /r/learnjapanese, where you can get a more realistic picture of how much work it'll be.

It's not impossible, but you do have to be prepared to do a lot of work.

It's the same with the other two languages, though.  Chinese and Korean are also in the category of ""hardest languages for an English native to speak.""

If your goal is to become really good at any of these languages, then it doesn't matter which one you pick.  They're going to have different learning curves, but the end result is still going to be many years away.  By the time you master enough vocabulary to be anywhere close to fluent in any of those languages, little things like Kanji or tones will feel like quaint beginner problems to you.

If your goal is to sound like a tourist phrasebook, then Korean will be easiest, since it presents the lowest initial difficulty level of the three (you don't have to learn Hanja right away, and although you have to get used to distinguishing some features that you don't have to distinguish in English, like voiced vs. unvoiced consonants, that's less short term trouble than tones).  In the long run, though, Korean isn't any easier.  You still have to learn tens of thousands of words with almost no help from any language you already speak.

You might also hear people saying, quite incorrectly, that Chinese has easy grammar.  This is very false.  It doesn't require you to memorize tables like many other languages do, but that doesn't make the grammar easy.  It just means the challenges come from elsewhere.

Your background won't help you with any of these languages, so pick the one you would most enjoy studying.  Maybe that's the one spoken in the country you'd most like to spend time in.  Maybe that's the one with the literature you'd most like to read (all three have a *ton* of good literature, much of it not available in English).

Placa en el número 87 de la calle Atocha de Madrid colocada con motivo del tercer centenario del Quijote. El texto dice: «Aquí estuvo la imprenta donde se hizo en 1604 la edición príncipe de la primera parte de El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha compuesta por Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, publicada en mayo [ sic ] de 1605. Conmemoración MDCCCCV».
La novela consta de dos partes: El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha, publicada con fecha de 1605, aunque impresa en diciembre de 1604, momento en que ya debió poder leerse en Valladolid,5​ y la Segunda parte del ingenioso caballero don Quijote de la Mancha, publicada en 1615.b​

Cervantes redactó en agosto de 1604 el prólogo y los poemas burlescos que preceden a la primera parte, fecha en la que ya debía haber presentado el original para su aprobación al Consejo Real,6​ ya que los trámites administrativos y la preceptiva aprobación por la censura se completaron el 26 de septiembre, cuando consta la firma del privilegio real.7​ De la edición se encargó don Francisco de Robles, «librero del Rey nuestro Señor», que invirtió en ella entre siete y ocho mil reales, de los cuales una quinta parte correspondía al pago del autor. Robles encargó la impresión de esta primera parte a la casa de Juan de la Cuesta, una de las imprentas que habían permanecido en Madrid después del traslado de la Corte a Valladolid,8​ que terminó el trabajo el 1 de diciembre, muy rápidamente para las condiciones de la época y con una calidad bastante mediocre, de un nivel no superior al habitual entonces en las imprentas españolas.9​ Esta edición princeps de 1604 contiene además un número elevadísimo de erratas que multiplica varias veces las encontradas en otras obras de Cervantes de similar extensión.10​ Los primeros ejemplares debieron enviarse a Valladolid, donde se expedía la tasa obligatoria que debía insertarse en los pliegos de cada ejemplar y que se fechó a 20 de diciembre, por lo que la novela debió estar disponible en la entonces capital la última semana del mes, mientras que en Madrid probablemente se tuvo que esperar a comienzos del año 1605.5​ Esta edición se reimprimió en el mismo año y en el mismo taller, de forma que hay en realidad dos ediciones autorizadas de 1605, y son ligeramente distintas: la diferencia más importante es que «El robo del rucio de Sancho», desaparecido en la primera edición, se cuenta en la segunda, aunque fuera de lugar.11​ Hubo, también, dos ediciones pirata publicadas el mismo año en Lisboa.12​


Segunda tirada de la primera edición de la primera parte, y primera edición de la segunda parte
Hay una teoría de que existió antes una novela más corta, en el estilo de sus futuras Novelas ejemplares. Ese escrito, si es que existió, está perdido, pero hay muchos testimonios de que la historia de don Quijote, sin entenderse exactamente a qué se refiere o la forma en que la noticia se circulara, fue conocida en círculos literarios antes de la primera edición (cuya impresión se acabó en diciembre de 1604). Por ejemplo, el toledano Ibrahim Taybilí, de nombre cristiano Juan Pérez y el escritor morisco más conocido entre los establecidos en Túnez tras la expulsión general de 1609-1612, narró una visita en 1604 a una librería en Alcalá en donde adquirió las Epístolas familiares y el Relox de Príncipes de Fray Antonio de Guevara y la Historia imperial y cesárea de Pedro Mexía. En ese mismo pasaje se burla de los libros de caballerías de moda y cita como obra conocida el Quijote. Eso le permitió a Jaime Oliver Asín añadir un dato a favor de la posible existencia de una discutida edición anterior a la de 1605. Tal hipótesis ha sido desmentida por Francisco Rico.

El Entremés de los romances y otras posibles fuentes de inspiración
Existe una obrita cuyos paralelos con Don Quijote son indiscutibles: el Entremés de los romances, en que el protagonista labrador enloquece por la lectura, pero de romances. El labrador abandonó a su mujer, y se echó a los caminos, como hizo don Quijote. Este entremés posee una doble lectura: también es una crítica a Lope de Vega, quien, después de haber compuesto numerosos romances autobiográficos en los que contaba sus amores, abandonó a su mujer y marchó a la Armada Invencible. Es conocido el interés de Cervantes por el romancero y su resentimiento por haber sido echado de los teatros por el mayor éxito de Lope de Vega, así como su carácter de gran entremesista. Un argumento a favor de esta hipótesis sería el hecho de que, a pesar de que el narrador nos dice que don Quijote ha enloquecido a causa de la lectura de libros de caballerías, durante su primera salida recita romances constantemente, sobre todo en los momentos de mayor desvarío. Por todo ello, podría ser una hipótesis verosímil. Sin embargo, los eruditos no están de acuerdo ni en la fecha del Entremés de los romances, ni en la fecha de composición de los primeros capítulos de Don Quijote, por lo cual no se sabe, en absoluto, cuál de las dos obras es fuente de la otra.13​
Dadas las extensísimas lecturas de Cervantes, que ningún erudito ha vuelto a leer en su totalidad (tarea imposible14​), se han sugerido una variedad de obras como inspiración de tal o cual episodio o aspecto de la obra. Entre ellas figuran:

Tirante el Blanco de Joanot Martorell.
Morgante de Luigi Pulci.
Orlando Furioso de Ludovico Ariosto.
El asno de oro de Apuleyo.15​
El Relato del peregrino, primera autobiografía de Ignacio de Loyola,16​ muy dado, como don Quijote y el mismo Cervantes, a la lectura de libros de caballerías en un momento de su vida.
Amadís de Gaula.
Estructura
La Primera Parte está dividida, a imitación del Amadís de Gaula, en cuatro partes. Conoció un éxito formidable —aunque como obra cómica, no como obra seria— y hubo varias reediciones y traducciones, unas autorizadas y otras no. No supuso un gran beneficio económico para el autor, quien había vendido todo el derecho de la obra a su editor Francisco de Robles.

Por otra parte, el ataque a Lope de Vega en el prólogo y las críticas del teatro del momento en el discurso del canónigo de Toledo (capítulo 48) supusieron atraer la inquina de los lopistas y del propio Lope, quien, hasta entonces, había sido amigo de Cervantes.

Eso motivó que, en 1614, saliera una segunda parte apócrifa de la obra bajo el nombre autoral, inventado o real, de Alonso Fernández de Avellaneda, y con pie de imprenta falso. En el prólogo se ofende gravemente a Cervantes tachándolo de envidioso, en respuesta al agravio infligido a Lope. No se tienen noticias de quién era este Fernández de Avellaneda, pero se han formulado teorías muy complejas al respecto; además, existió un personaje coetáneo, cura de Avellaneda (Ávila), que pudo ser el autor. Un importante cervantista, Martín de Riquer, sospecha que fue otro personaje real, Jerónimo de Pasamonte, un militar compañero de Cervantes y autor de un libro autobiográfico, agraviado por la publicación de la primera parte, en la que aparece como el galeote Ginés de Pasamonte. Y es incluso posible que se inspirara en la continuación que estaba elaborando Cervantes.

En 1615 se publicó la continuación auténtica de la historia de don Quijote, la de Cervantes, con el título de Segunda parte del ingenioso caballero don Quijote de la Mancha. En ella, el novelista jugaría con el hecho de que el protagonista se entera de que ya la gente ha empezado a leer la primera parte de sus aventuras, en que, tanto él como Sancho Panza, aparecen nombrados como tales, además de la existencia de la segunda parte espuria.",True,False,0,1522705003,,False,0,dwp2alq,False,t3_893tt2,True,t1_dwp2ags,/r/podemos/comments/893tt2/maroto_por_una_vez_tiene_toda_la_razón_lo_de_la/dwp2alq/,,1525878701,1,False,True,False,podemos,t5_31h78,public,

Es conocido el interés de Cervantes por el romancero y su resentimiento por haber sido echado de los teatros por el mayor éxito de Lope de Vega, así como su carácter de gran entremesista. Un argumento a favor de esta hipótesis sería el hecho de que, a pesar de que el narrador nos dice que don Quijote ha enloquecido a causa de la lectura de libros de caballerías, durante su primera salida recita romances constantemente, sobre todo en los momentos de mayor desvarío. Por todo ello, podría ser una hipótesis verosímil. Sin embargo, los eruditos no están de acuerdo ni en la fecha del Entremés de los romances, ni en la fecha de composición de los primeros capítulos de Don Quijote, por lo cual no se sabe, en absoluto, cuál de las dos obras es fuente de la otra.13​
Dadas las extensísimas lecturas de Cervantes, que ningún erudito ha vuelto a leer en su totalidad (tarea imposible14​), se han sugerido una variedad de obras como inspiración de tal o cual episodio o aspecto de la obra. Entre ellas figuran:

Tirante el Blanco de Joanot Martorell.
Morgante de Luigi Pulci.
Orlando Furioso de Ludovico Ariosto.
El asno de oro de Apuleyo.15​
El Relato del peregrino, primera autobiografía de Ignacio de Loyola,16​ muy dado, como don Quijote y el mismo Cervantes, a la lectura de libros de caballerías en un momento de su vida.
Amadís de Gaula.
Estructura
La Primera Parte está dividida, a imitación del Amadís de Gaula, en cuatro partes. Conoció un éxito formidable —aunque como obra cómica, no como obra seria— y hubo varias reediciones y traducciones, unas autorizadas y otras no. No supuso un gran beneficio económico para el autor, quien había vendido todo el derecho de la obra a su editor Francisco de Robles.

Por otra parte, el ataque a Lope de Vega en el prólogo y las críticas del teatro del momento en el discurso del canónigo de Toledo (capítulo 48) supusieron atraer la inquina de los lopistas y del propio Lope, quien, hasta entonces, había sido amigo de Cervantes.

Eso motivó que, en 1614, saliera una segunda parte apócrifa de la obra bajo el nombre autoral, inventado o real, de Alonso Fernández de Avellaneda, y con pie de imprenta falso. En el prólogo se ofende gravemente a Cervantes tachándolo de envidioso, en respuesta al agravio infligido a Lope. No se tienen noticias de quién era este Fernández de Avellaneda, pero se han formulado teorías muy complejas al respecto; además, existió un personaje coetáneo, cura de Avellaneda (Ávila), que pudo ser el autor. Un importante cervantista, Martín de Riquer, sospecha que fue otro personaje real, Jerónimo de Pasamonte, un militar compañero de Cervantes y autor de un libro autobiográfico, agraviado por la publicación de la primera parte, en la que aparece como el galeote Ginés de Pasamonte. Y es incluso posible que se inspirara en la continuación que estaba elaborando Cervantes.

En 1615 se publicó la continuación auténtica de la historia de don Quijote, la de Cervantes, con el título de Segunda parte del ingenioso caballero don Quijote de la Mancha. En ella, el novelista jugaría con el hecho de que el protagonista se entera de que ya la gente ha empezado a leer la primera parte de sus aventuras, en que, tanto él como Sancho Panza, aparecen nombrados como tales, además de la existencia de la segunda parte espuria.",True,False,0,1522705013,,False,0,dwp2awe,False,t3_893tt2,True,t1_dwp2alq,/r/podemos/comments/893tt2/maroto_por_una_vez_tiene_toda_la_razón_lo_de_la/dwp2awe/,,1525878704,1,False,True,False,podemos,t5_31h78,public,

The crusades happened because the Turks invaded Europe and almost wiped out the Europeans. They bolstered up and pushed back. While they were winning they kept on pushing. Religion was an excuse to get men to join, but blaming religion for the crusades is like blaming money for WWII because soldiers got paid for thier service. You're blaming a tool for abuse caused by men. That's completely asinine. 

If there was no religion, the crusades still would have happened. Because they were about land and power. Without religion the men in power would have found another reason to send men to war.

Kings demand to be worshipped by God's so therefore all God's are man-made? That's a total logical fallacy. It doesn't even make sense. 

Also science in the middle ages was boosted by religious men of all kinds, not stifled.

False,Schmidtz,,,,"&gt;Not sure why you call it ""Western""; Christianity isn't much better or anything.

The reason why have our societies today, with the history, religions and ethics stems from not only Christianity, but also the combination of Christianity and Greek ethics. That is essentially the new testament in a nutshell.

You realize that Muslims are the ones suffering under the very religion they adhere to? I know of no Christian nation in the west that calls for the death of homosexuals, apostates, adulturers, force women to wear certain attire or face social/legislative punishment  as a consequence of not wearing ""modest"" clothing etc. But plenty of Muslim nation's that has it codified into their legislature, as they adhere to Sharia laws and the Hadiths. If it is not written in law, it's still carried out in similarity to vigilante justice, with unofficial Sharia courts acting as the possible mediator.

Seriously, if Western nation's had the same level of tolerance as Muslim nations, there wouldn't be anywhere near as many Muslims in Europe and the west as a whole. There are barely any minorities left in MENA region, which even includes subsects of muslims under the tyrannigal rule of Sunni/Shia muslims. Christians are virtually extinct in ratio when comparing them to Muslims.

&gt;There are very few religions which aren't very sexist because religious tend to be old and gender equality is a very new concept that was largely made possible by the medical advancement of contraception. A lot of people often praise Buddhism as something enlightened but you should read on its stance on the relation between the sexes.

Not all religions have equal progress made, nor do they have the same perspective on women. Hence, they're not equally bad. Some are better, some is worse, but let's not beat around the bush with which Abrahamic religion has the most counterproductive view on women.

&gt;Same reason why a lot of feminists cannot let go of high heels and a lot of shit they feel makes them ""feminine"" regardless of how much it clearly disadvantages them because they associate it with what they are which really is what their culture brainwashed them to be since childhood. ""feminine"" and ""female"" have very little to do with each other and are completely arbitrary.

Social constructionism claims that biology and sex vary independently. Evolutionary biology and psychology, based on research on humans and other animals, shows otherwise. There is nothing arbitrary about women wearing high heels, because they are exposing their waist by pertruding forward. It's a sign of sexual proclivity, the same reason why we associate the colour red with ripe fruit and arousal. That's why red lipstick and other makeup exist.

You will find humans and animals sharing the exact same characteristics in many aspects, with some animals sharing the same system as we do. For example, lobsters have the same serotonin system as we do. High serotonin means they will extend themselves a lot more than the average lobster or hunch back if they have low serotonin levels, which happens when they have confrontations between male lobsters.
Humans does the exact same thing. This is why you can give a low serotonin lobster anti depressants, and the lobster will be eager to go back and fight with other lobsters.",True,False,0,1522705113,,False,0,dwp2dti,False,t3_88w4lh,True,t1_dwo8cxl,/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/88w4lh/everything_you_need_to_know_about_antisemitism_in/dwp2dti/,,1525878748,2,False,True,False,TwoXChromosomes,t5_2r2jt,public,

As far as the neighbors, Israel has arguably the most advanced military in the world where every man and woman has to serve. It’s an unconquerable country, at least without resorting to WMDs. Historically, Israel has already beaten invading armies at least three times which were much greater in strength. And they weren’t just defeats for the Arabs, their armies were devastated. 

Economically, Israel has a thriving, high tech economy, which is much stronger than most neighbors. 

Personally, I’ve travelled through israel proper and the West Bank. It’s funny how when you actually see the places and talk to people, most nerratives just become plain wrong. 

People on both sides are neither good, nor bad, and they both want the same things——to be happy. 

For example, Israel-proper is a diverse country. It’s a mix of Palestinians who stayed, Jews that were there since forever, new Jews from Europe, African Jews, and Druze, just to name a few. They are all represented in a democratically-elected Knesset and live with full rights as citizens of Israel. I find it hard to call such a system an apartheid, even if they are committing some atrocities against Palestinians. 

And the Palestinians have many legitimate grievances against Israel and several neighboring countries. Obviously, one of those is not getting shot,  it there are others that I would say hold greater importance, like economic freedom and freedom of movement. In addition, Palestinians have large elements of radicalization, and it’s been a total problem for them getting omg their goals achieved. 

You see? Both are good and bad, and its what makes it so complicated. And I know the argument that Israelis are just an offshoot of European imperialism and should pick up and leave, but what about the Israelis that were born there? (At this point that’s most of them).

Lastly, traveling through Israel and the West Bank is like going from Western Europe to Eastern. Yeah, the West Bank is noticeably shittier than Israel-proper, but it’s far from the hell hole the media paints it out to be. I can’t speak to Gaza as I haven’t been there and I’ve heard it worse than the West Bank.

I don't disagree with you, either, and also I can't say that I've had this experience with Dutch people specifically (in person it's only happened with British and Israelis, online it has just been ""Europeans,"" who could have been from anywhere). I appreciate your explanation.

I also agree that we Americans tackle our race issue the wrong way sometimes. People think that we've accomplished something huge by making the n-word something that is basically the worst thing a white person can possibly say. I'm not saying that's a bad thing. I don't like the word, I don't like hearing it, but I know for a fact that plenty of people still use it. Just because Bob doesn't feel comfortable leaning over and exposing his racist views to his fellow countryman on the bus anymore doesn't mean we solved anything. It just means Bob is bottling all his racism up inside and manifesting it in things like how he votes, how he hires people, how he treats people, who he rents to, etc. So what have we really accomplished by silencing him?

My issue has been that I've come across people who straight up do not think their country has a race problem. It was weird enough to hear it from a British guy, but for an Israeli to tell me that? I live here. I know for a fact that there is a race problem here (although I don't think you need to live here to know that). I wasn't meaning to single out Europeans for this either as Israelis aren't Europeans, but those are who I've had experiences with on this topic. In my experience, Canadians with acknowledge they have issues but still say it's worse in America (and I haven't been to Canada enough to know if that's the case) and Australians say the same (I've only seen that said online for whatever that's worth, and I've also never been to Australia so I can't comment on their racial climate). But with some Europeans and Israelis, I've had people just straight up say they don't have race problems, and there is just no way they're correct.

I don't know who has it worse. I'm not saying America's race issues are better than Netherlands's or anyone else's. And even if our issues are less, they still exist, so that's not really a consolation prize. So please don't think I'm trying to make it out to be some kind of competition, because regardless we're all still losing. But the willingness to recognize that the problems *exists* has been a big difference between Americans and people from other places in the world that I've noticed.

And again, these are all my experiences. I'm sure there are plenty of British people who know you have a problem, plenty of Israeli people who know they have a problem, etc. I don't mean to say everyone is the same. I haven't met or interacted with even close to 1/50th of any of these populations, so what I say is not the golden rule.

Even though information about the Eastern Front was classified, and the state propaganda boasted about successes, he was smart enough to know what's up. Soviets were reorganising themselves. Somehow, they managed to move their factories far east, beyond the range of German bombers. Somehow, they managed to pump out enough tanks to replace ones being destroyed. All of that, while Wehrmachts supply lines were getting thinner and thinner. Third Reich was getting starved of natural and human resources, and couldn't supply even more widening front line. They needed an ally, somebody, anybody who could divert some Soviet attention away from the main front line. Japanese were too focused on Chinese and Americans to be a threat to Russians.
	

It was time for Finland to repay for the Winter War support it got from the Third Reich.
	

Klaus Schmidt entered the Finnish Parliment building without much trouble. Seeing his SS uniform, Finnish guards didn't requred much authentication from him. He didn't even need his ""diplomatic visa"". As he was being led to the Prime Minister Chancellery, the guards were glowering at him. He was not a welcomed guest, that was sure.
	

&amp;nbsp;
	

""Welcome. What's the reason of that lovely visit?"" asked Johan Wilhelm Rangell, Finnish Prime Minister. His face and tone of the voice was sending completely different message. He looked like somebody who for last few decades waged a war on smile, and won.
	

""Finland is beatiful this time of the year. Nature is already prepared for the worst, and now anxiously awaits the malicious winters attack."" Answered Klaus, using this time to get rid of his scarf and heavy cloak. He was already getting sweaty under in the warm Parliment building, and the guards marched too quickly for him to put it down. ""You can say the same about Finland itself.""


""I've already talked to Himmler. We're not going to deport you our jews."" He answered shortly. *Why they're so fond of these pests?* thought Klaus.
	

""You might be surprised, but my visit has nothing to do with the Jewish Question."" Klaus smiled. ""I am looking for an ally in a just war, that's all I ask for""
	
	
""Just war? Are you capable of waging those?""
	
	
Klaus gritted his teeth in silence. This small nation was getting cocky. Who have heard of Prime Minister mocking his most important military ally?
	
	
""I presume you mean one with the Soviets."" Johan must have noticed Klaus reaction to his jab. ""Weren't you winning it?""
	

""Oh yes, we absolutely do Johan. But-""
		

""Please, in internatonal relations I am Prime Minister Rangell, Mister Schmidt.""
	

""Naturally Prime Minister. We do have great advances in the Eastern Front. But the problem is that the Soviet people... they are fanatically dedicated to their cruel dictator. Every day Soviet general send to us waves and waves of warm bodies in hope some of them will avoid our bullets. Body count is absolutely horrible.""
	
	
""It is hard to imagine Russians are still using that tactics."" Replied Johan with discontent. He was right, Soviets stopped using the tactics of idiots promoted to generalhood after the purge just before the Winter War. But it was true, that waves and waves of well equipped Soviet soldiers were being being thrown at German forces with tactical precision, and that Soviet Generals were surely hoping their men won't die. Body count was in milions. So, in a sense, Klaus was telling the truth.


""They adapt slowly but surely."" Replied Klaus. Johan couldn't be made believing that Germans are losing the war, but he shouldn't believe it was too easy. ""In the meantime, milions die. But what milions of people mean to Stallin, if he can stay in power?""
	
	
""Are you trying to get me into the war by appealing to morality?"" Johan snorted with laughter. ""No, I don't wish to join your meatgrinder. I don't see slaying milions of people to save them patricularly moral.""
	

*It is still worth a try.* Thought Klaus. *If Johan thinks of himself as being morally superior to Nazis, then he would surely be compelled to react to atrocities we reacted to. If he doesn't, he risks being a hypocrite. And if you think you've seen through my trick, Johan, you're deeply mistaken.*
	

""Have you got the news from Estonia?"" Asked Klaus with innocent tone.
	
	
""Estonia? What Estonians have to do with us participating in your war with Soviets?""
	

""Well, they used to be occupied by them, until last year. When we we're freeing them, they were cheering and waving flags. We proudly liberated Estonian nation.""
	

""I'd sooner eat my desk than see Estonians cheering at approaching German army."" Johan was highly suspicious, and rightly so. Tiny Estonian nation was for hundreds of years ruled by Germans (under the Russian Tzar), and detested them dearly. Soviets must have done something unspeakable to Estonians for them to change their mind so quickly.
	

""It is true. We even got Estonian volunteer joining us. Before we even attacked, Estonian deserters from the Red Army opened fire on the Soviets."" Klaus conviniently left out the detail where Wehrmacht upon realising that Estonian partisants are fighting the Soviers decided to halt and let partisans do the dying. Later all partisan groups were disbanded, and national Estonian flag was soon replaced with one of Nazi Germany. And it was true that there were people, who were cheering the arrival of Nazis. For a while it looked like Estonia might be free again. For a while.
	

""It is not that surprising. Estonians are most Germanic of the people living in Baltic area. They may resisted us in the past, but I am sure we're going to find a way to coexist."" Klaus was not aware of Generalplan Ost, but he was smart enough to realise that 'coexistence' meant mass death for Estonians. But Johan didn't need to know that. He might've took an offence to what was planned to Finlands sister nation.
	

""And if you learn of atrocities the Soviets have done to them, you would't be surprised they decided to join us. After communists unrurly gained control over them via coup, they imposed a regime of terror. During first year of occupation they arrested 8,000 people who migh have lead the nation. Quarter of them were executed immidately."" Johan flinched. 8,000 was a lot for such tiny nation. ""Others ended in gualg somewhere in Siberia. I don't need ot tell you, that people rarely make it out alive from those.""
	

Of course, in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of Nazi Germany and Soviet Union divided the parts of eastern europe between themselves, including Estonia. That's why Nazi Germany didn't oppose Soviet takeover of Estonia in the slightest. Klaus decided that Johan shouldn't be made aware of that secret agreement.
	

Johans stare at Klaus was as intense as heat of molten iron. * I got him.* Klaus thought. *I just need a bit more...*
	

""This was only the beginning. Soviets organised mass deportations. It didn't even mattered to them if one was communist or not. Stallins paranoia was spreading to all of his people. Even a shadow of doubt was enough to death sentence. At the end, KGB were killing to fill up the quota. We don't know exacly how many of Estonians we're deported, but it's tens of thousands. All in the first year of Soviet occupation.""
	

""It is still time to save them, Johan."" Finnish Prime Minister didn't obect on being called by his name. *Perfect*. ""They're still alive in the gualgs, at the frozen end of the world. I know you don't care about our War with Soviets Johan. And that's fine. But you surely care about thousands of innocent people who were kidnapped from their homes and worked to death in Siberia.""
	

""You can still save them, Johan. But we need your help. The faster we capitulate the Soviets, the more lives we can save. You surely care about that, aren't you?""
	
Johan Wilhelm Rangell, Finnish Prime Minister, was sitting like frozen in his chair. He surely didn't expected that. And he surely he didn't expected Klaus to have any proof, but here it was, that Nazi bastard, opening his breifcase and putting out photos, documents, orders. All written in russian. All filled with Estonian names. Thousands of them. They were similar to Finnish ones. Kalus let him browse through them freely.
	

""I need..."" Johan started.
	

""Yes?""
	

""I-i need time to think"" answered Johan.
	

""Of course. But please be aware, that the more you wait, the more people die"". Klaus left the briefcase with documents for Johan to indulge in, kindly bowed, and exited the room. Things went according to the plan. Hopefully lead by righteous rage Finns will join the offensive.

False,HockeyHokeyHockey,,,,"&gt;Btw, how'd it work out with your parents?

Got a Bible thrown hard enough at my face that I had the black eye up until a couple days ago. 

Been getting random calls from some Catholic counseling service about my alleged ""interest in therapy-ing myself straight."" (Thanks, dad.../s)

Other than my dad doing that, my mom's 100% convinced it's a phase. 

Not a phase, and the only reason I say that - you know how you never really realized you were straight, you just were? No aha moment, just you liked girls/dudes whatever you're not? 

Same for me. 

&gt;I'll guessing we would disagree about how important it is to conform to gender roles. 

That's not only a homerun, that's a rocket launch. 

&gt;There are women that would make great soldiers and would be very competent in their job, but I think it causes scandal because people start to see it as normative.

I mean, female soldiers have been around for a hot minute (Joan of Ark, etc in Europe and ton of ancient Asia). I legitimately don't see it as scandalous, although if you want to elaborate on that feel free. 

&gt;Women are naturally ordered towards bearing and raising children. Obviously, being in the armed services is at odds with that.

I hate to sound like a SJW, but not all women are. Like, me as example A. And, regardless, I know plenty of moms in my unit alone, never mind the Army as a whole. 

&gt;Men, on the other hand are naturally ordered towards protecting their family.

Again, from my point of view at least, gross generalization. 

&gt;So, the armed forces is obviously a better fit there.

I mean, even if the above's true, there's like 150+ jobs in the Army, maybe 10 or 15 of them will see combat under normal operations, and even that's stretching it. 

&gt;but I think they should have a job that is normative for their respective gender because it can cause scandal

I guess this boils down to me trying to say feel free to try and live like Leave It To Beaver all you'd like, I'd just appreciate not having my career fields limited due to being forced into that archetype. 

(Seriously though, I have less than 0% desire to actually have kids, but props to stay at home moms. Entirely not my jam, because I'd go batshit with only little kids to talk to all day. 

Flight medic is a lot more fun and interesting.) 

&gt;cause scandal

The thing is, on top of me entirely disagreeing with this, it quite literally is a slippery slope. 

I can see the ""why should females have dangerous jobs"" train of thought transferring fairly easily into the ""why should females have jobs outside of working with kids"" one. 

The way I see it, because I'm an adult American and (should/) have the freedom to pursue a career I'm qualified for, without taking into regards what's in between my legs. (Don't mean to sound crass, but...)

&gt; think in general we make too many accommodations for exceptions. We should have norms based upon what's best for everyone as a whole not what will make each individual happy or satisfied. I think we're way too worried about ""leaving someone out"".

The way I understand this, I shouldn't be allowed to pursue a career due to it being a ""boys only"" club even if I'm more than qualified (I've gotten great reviews by every level of command that actually gives a crap about an E5, and I got the chest candy to show for it).

So, like I said, the way I understand this is that I shouldn't have been able to pursue a career that I enjoy and, by pretty much all review, am pretty darn good at because someone's morality says that women don't belong there, qualifications be damned? 

&gt;I don't mean to sound crass, but we should have norms that work best for everyone as a general matter, and then be kind and charitable and understanding to those who have a hard time with that stuff, and help them find a good place rather than just changing the norms.
&gt;Not sure if that makes sense.

It really doesn't, but I'm by all means open to hearing elaboration.

False,erissays,,,,"&gt; I'm not sure I can agree with your assertion that ""the academic interest in various specific collections of tales wouldn't really happen until the early 1900s."" Translations of the Grimm collection inspired reactions through much of Europe as would-be collectors recognized that their local oral tradition also needed to be salvaged (as you correctly note, there was an international movement to gather oral narratives). This was an initial reaction to the work by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, and it was usually framed as an academic interest.

I definitely see where you're coming from and how you could interpret my assertion as such (and you're right to do so, especially if I actually had been saying what you had interpreted me as saying). I interpreted that question as being more of a ""when did people start examining the Brothers Grimm tales in particular as an academic pursuit"" in the vein of someone like Maria Tatar writing *The Hard Facts of the Grimm's Fairy Tales* rather than the larger academic/scholarly conversation that was going on in the ""salvage phase"" as a *response* to the publication of *Household Tales*. You, on the other hand, I think are interpreting the question more in the vein of ""when did people start observing the Grimm's tales with a scholarly eye and enter into academic conversation about fairy tales and folklore because of them,"" which is a different question (one you gave an excellent and comprehensive answer to!). I was approaching the question more from an ""evidence of academic criticism of a text"" angle while you were approaching it more from a ""the international scholarly discussion sparked by the publication of the Grimm's Tales"" angle, both of which are completely valid answers and important in different ways to provide a comprehensive answer.

&gt; China&amp;#039;s defunct Tiangong-1 space station hurtled towards Earth on Sunday and was expected to re-enter the atmosphere within hours.

&gt; The European Space Agency forecast that the station, whose name translates as &amp;quot;Heavenly Palace&amp;quot;, will re-enter sometime between Sunday night and early Monday GMT. The Chinese space agency said it should happen during the course of Monday Beijing time.

&gt; Launched in 2011, Tiangong-1 was China&amp;#039;s first space station, serving as an experimental platform for bigger projects, such as the Tiangong-2 launched in September 2016 and a future permanent Chinese space station.

If you want to involve religion then realise the 'jews' wanted to take palestine (or more importantly, the holy land) because that's how its written in their 'holy book'. Is that an excuse for ethnically cleansing hunderds of thousands palestinians? I don't think so.

Furthermore the Palestinians and arab were defending themselves from the en masse immigrating european colonists who were invading the countries in the hunderds of thousands in the fourties and took 56% of arab land, and afterwards started to take more and more.

To be in the global 1% in terms of wealth, however, you need $770,000 USD in equity.

I don't mean to point this out to say that inequality isn't a huge problem. But I suspect many people reading this thread come from families that are part of the global top 1-5%.

&gt;The bar to enter the top 1% wouldn't be this low were it not for the extreme poverty that so much of the globe endures. For example, an adult in India has a median wealth of $608 in total wealth, according to a report by Credit Suisse. The average wealth of adults in Africa is even lower at just $411. 

&gt;Compare that to the wealth of $49,460 for the average adult living in North America and $11,319 for Europeans.

edit: It's important to note that this article is talking about the wealth created in 2017 and not income. The article isn't stating the 1% income earners in the world gained 82% of the income. It's saying that the 1% of wealth holders gained 82% of the wealth.

A lot of people are also mentioning that the cost of living is a lot higher in developed countries which is a good point.

I wish I had written down the day that Leftists discovered ""wealth inequality"".  It wasn't that long ago, less than 20 years.  

Before then, the idea was the Eurosocialism was just ""better"", obviously.  It would make things unquestionable good, while things were unquestionably bad in the US.

But that was obviously not working out.  Europe was sort of puttering along economically, while the US kept getting richer and richer.

Then someone discovered a number that the US didn't excel at: lots of people were richer, most people were richer than Europeans, but not _everyone_ was richer than Europeans.  

Ooh, look at... Sweden.  Sure, it's smaller than North Carolina, but _that_ is the way things are supposed to be run.  Nobody's rich, except the Ikea guy, but at least (except for the Muslims, and that's probably the US's fault) nobody's poor.  And that's important, because reasons.

Of course, the US doesn't have ""multi-generational billionaire dynasties""  (Mark Zuckerberg's father was a dentist; the Koch brothers' dad was a chemist; Jeff Bezos's mother was a 18-year-old single mom divorced from a bike-shop owner) or ""impoverished masses"" (the average ""poor person"" in the US has a car, two televisions, and cable-TV). 

I have to warn you, though: Scandinavia, especially Sweden, is imploding.  They are taking in a lot of immigrants, who consume social services and commit crimes, and the Swedes just don't have the heart to kick them out.

&gt;The British had invested in the education of the Asian minority, &gt;in preference to that of indigenous Ugandans.[4] By the early 1970s, many Indians in Southeast Africa and Uganda were employed in the sartorial and banking businesses and Indophobia was already engrained by the start of Amin's rule in February 1971.[2] While not all Ugandan Asians were well off, they were on average better off than the indigenous communities,[2]constituting 1% of the population while receiving a fifth of the national income.

I identify as mixed, always. I never 100% fit in with either side, yet I also feel so comfortable in both settings. I never really think of myself in a racial way, if that makes sense. I'm never thinking others look at me as different... but then they bring it up. Around my croatian family, I'm ""slightly exotic"". Around my asian sides, I'm ""the white-passing one"". 

I do honestly look more caucasian than east asian. IMO I don't look British white, but I do look Southern European white. I have the big (okay, really big) eyes. But I have asian colouring, asian hair (but mine's wavy/curly, so it's coarse AND curlier than european hair lol), asian skin, a full-on asian name (first name too). So it confuses people a lot. I pass as a lot of things. 

A part of me does slightly lean more towards the asian sides. I do like to identify myself more with asia as a whole. But I'm aware that I'm also tied to europe. I believe I identify slightly (and I do mean slightly) more with the asian side because I grew up in Canada, and because I don't look blonde-and-blue-eyed, and because of my name, I've always had the majority of people (aka white people) identify me as ""other"". So I simply don't fully identify with white people because I've always had that experience here. 

It's weird because when I go to europe, no one really assumes I'm east asian. I do sometimes get middle eastern or Italian but no one stops and says I must be japanese/korean as well. When I've been to asia, people IMMEDIATELY know I'm not full-on asian. Most people think I'm maybe 1/4 asian, and I have to reassure them that I'm half. IDK lol.

Depending on the era of armour the samurai would be effectively immune to any kind of cuts or slashes from a sword, especially if he is using the later era armour which borrowed European elements like single piece breast plates which could even offer protection against matchlock muskets. Combined this with the shitty-grade swords used by the weebs which would probably have difficulty getting through even gambeson and you would need serious skill actually defeating his armour, skills that we are lead to believe that the weebs don't have.

Thus I would argue that the master samurai would be effectively immune to any sword-based attack from the weebs, with their only way to win is to pin the samurai down and go at his weakpoints like his armpits. However again we are lead to believe at the weebs are neither knowledgeable nor coordinated/cooperative enough to do this even if the samurai let them to. Thus the only real way I can see the weebs defeating the samurai is to literally overwhelm him and suffocate him under their combined weight. But then again the weebs are not bloodlusted at all and considering their flimsy motivation for fighting they would probably individually back off whenever they got hurt at all.

In conclusion I believe the amount of weebs that are needed to defeat the master samurai is mostly based on the on the samurai's physical endurance and how long he can spend effectively seal clubbing before tiring he out so much that he literally dies of exhaustion, what I actually think is the most likely way he would be defeated. Of course this is assuming they were fighting on an open field as if it was in an enclosed space death by crushing suddenly becomes more likely.

All that did was offload the most physically intensive parts of combat from the samurai to his horse. Now the amount of weebs needed is the amount required to tire-out both the horse and samurai.

This a great point, I learnt a lot from our discussion. I'm guessing certain states fine them for the pollution caused by flaring and also for not collecting the gas.

I completely understand why you called NatGas essentially free. My argument is mostly about economics: The input= Operating costs, taxes etc. &gt; The output= Oil and Gas.  Anyways you have a really great understanding of this subject and I feel like I'm arguing semantics. 

&gt;US can in fact pressure Europe to diversify and buy more expensive gas in exchange for either security (the ""Russia uses gas as a pressure tool"" narrative) or trade accessibility (don't want to get hit by import taxes? Allow preferential treatment to US natgas shipments).

False,PoliticalDissidents,,,,"Keep in mind that to get industrial rates you'll also need industrial consumption. Where I am you can get 3.5 cent/kwh too (slightly less expensive actually) but you'll need to consume a minimum of 5 megawatts to get that rate. Which means you need a few million dollars worth of hardware. That said for a few kilowatts worth of consumption it'd cost me $0.06/kwh. So I don't know exactly how that applies to you but I'm going to go out on a limb here and say you'll be in a similar situation and won't see that 3.5 cent electricity. That said double that price  is still dirt cheap too. Heck I'm mining at the residential rates of $0.07/kWh and that'd dirt cheap compared to the global market. If you are paying that you are still extremely competitive so electricity price isn't an issue where you are. 

However while price isn't an issue capacity is. Electricity is cheap so you can buy somewhat less efficient hardware if you ROI quick. So let's assume you'll buy Antminer T9s. That's 10.5 TH/s at 1400 watts. If your rent on that industrial property is $1000/m then right now with the low BTC prices as it is then that'll mean you'll need about 10 T9s to cover rent and electricity. With PSU set you back about $8k plus taxes. If prices go up you'll make more than just what is needed for rent and electricity combined but if prices are as is you need more so do that to mitigate risk. 

Now that's the  base line needed to cover those expenses. Now it's nor worth it to buy 11 ASIC because now you spend $9k and you're making the same profit as spending less than $1k and mining at home. So you need to make it worth it. Let's say a $1k/month profit minimum is your goal if you rent a space? Okay now you need 20 ASICs that sets you back a little shy of $18k but throw in taxes let's say $20k.

Now to accommodate that you need 28 kW of power. At 120v that's 233 amps. But you'll want to run at 220/240v as it's more efficient. If you're in Europe or Asia or most of the world  220-240v is the norm but if you're in North  America's then it's 110/120v but it can easily wire it as 220/240v. At 240v we're talking 116 amps.

For some perspective my house has a 200 amp 120v breaker box. Heck in some house they only have 100 amps. Now remember you never want to run any continuous load on your breakers at over 80% capacity so you need more than that 28 kW capacity.

You'll need an electrician to install all of that that'll cost you too. You probably aren't consuming massive amounts of electricity so nothing too outside of the ordinary but its still higher capacity than what a home would consume and most likely the only industrial properties you'll find fitted for that are way too big. Mining is a small space with lots of electricity. Other industrial applications take up way more space for that load so any small space you'll need to pay to have it fitted. 

You'll probably need PDUs to distribute the power.

The  job need lots of ventilation. In distribution grade fans and so forth those ASICs produce a lot of heat.

Okay now you need to set up networking. You'll need a router and some switches lots of ethernet cables. 

You'll also need to set up a security camera system.

With that much hardware you'll probably want redundant internet so go get internet from two different ISPs. One as a backup line. Use pfsense as a router and you can configure redundant WANs. If operation is big enough you'll want redundant routers two so get two router and run each switch to both. 

Anyhow **TL:DR** if you aren't ready to drop about $15-$20k into this investment then it'll be more profitable for you not to mine at an industrial space and to just mine at home and it'll cost you much less in terms of start up capital (as little as $1000 is enough to start). You might want to start there unless you got the money.

There is a garden known from this time for the garden of Eden. There is a city of Jericho. There is a demi-god in another religion called Nimrod credited with creating Jericho in the bible. 

Here is list of some of the stories and places that contributed in part to the stories found in genesis:

* https://www.britannica.com/place/Jericho-West-Bank
* https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/etemenanki.htm
* https://www.ancient.eu/Ninurta/
* http://www.ancient-literature.com/other_gilgamesh.html
* https://www.ancient.eu/article/225/enuma-elish---the-babylonian-epic-of-creation---fu/
* https://www.ancient.eu/article/216/the-myth-of-adapa/

I will note that there are other creation stories and the bible seems to allude to 3 of them. One of them explains the 6 day creation similar to genesis 1:1 to genesis 2:3. One is very brief leading into Adam and Eve about 1 day creation. One seems to be mentioned in the book of Job. 

In the anti-deluvian Sumerian king list (before 2900 BC) there are kings that seem to match up with Seth to Noah in the bible. Adam is linked to the Adapa which may be a demigod. 

The reasons the biblical stories are not identical may come from oral traditions and the combining of many different stories. Now instead of a godly crotch to hold the sky up we have a firmament and instead of the stars, sun, and moon being part of this firmament they lie inside it... since the bible says the earth is flat covered by a crystal dome we have flat earthers. 

The first 5 books called the Torah were compiled *after* many of the other stories and during the Babylonian exile where they reminisced about the good days. They created a David and a Solomon, they created a Moses, they copied stories from Babylon for their own purposes. 

This here establishes that the Torah *is* written by humans and is *not* of divine inspiration. The 4 abrahamic religions (Baha'i, Islam, Christianity, and Judaism) rely on some of these stories being true and/or divinely inspired... and oddly enough you can show all 4 of them are baseless at the same time... outside of the idea Jesus was historical which is for another discussion.


For literalists there is a problem for taking the beginning of earth as 4004 BC because of the evidence against that. A problem with the only flood being 2000 BC when it is clearly described as 2900 BC with Babylonian stories written between 2600 BC and 1100 BC making their way into Torah/Bible stories written between 1000 BC and 250 BC. Also if Noah had a grandson who built Jericho either the flood happened before 9000 BC or the city was built after 2000 BC yet the stories that led to Nimrod are only from around 2600 BC or earlier (meaning he couldn't be the grandson of someone who lived later) and the archeological evidence points to Jericho being one of the constantly inhabited cities all the way back to 9000 BC and it is *not* the oldest settlement. Someone known about only in the third millennium BC and later could not be born in the second millennium BC or build a city in the 10th millennium BC.

She's asked to describe OmiseGO tech and comment on regulation. She does describe the broader strokes of what they're up to, then loses her place and asks, ""Sorry, can you repeat the questions?"" (see https://youtu.be/bFqlq3yPeEQ?t=26m47s / https://youtu.be/bFqlq3yPeEQ?t=28m59s)

When the questions are restated, she declines to make predictions, which is fair in some sense, but comes off as her not knowing the direction of the industry in even the near future. Her only recommendation for regulation is education. While education is necessary, her response is useless in that it includes no context specific information or guidance.

Around 45:31, she again brings up the importance of interoperability and the ability to trade tokens across networks. (see https://youtu.be/bFqlq3yPeEQ?t=45m31s) The Ripple representative's response echoed my immediate thoughts. Those thoughts were something to the effect of ""Oh, what a great idea. Someone should design a protocol like that. Maybe they could call it Inter-Ledger Protocol!"" This moment revealed that she's uneducated enough about the world outside of Omise to not realize that ILP is already becoming the standard.

Similarly, she mentioned building a decentralized exchange earlier in the talk, and even suggests that Ripple could use it. Does she not realize that the XRP ledger *also* includes the ability to issue arbitrary tokens AND a decentralized exchange? In fact, it's the world's highest volume decentralized exchange platform.

Further, she doesn't realize that Ripple is attacking a payments problem, not just a bank to bank problem. She seems to think that micro-payments are not on Ripple's radar, but nothing could be further from the truth. To paraphrase Chris Larsen, it's his vision that not only will international payments of $50 be possible, but also payments of $0.50. Her specific example of paying $63 for a $200 wire transfer is actually the *first* use case of XRP, with xRapid enabling payment service providers  to drastically lower fees.

One other small item to nitpick: she was uncertain about PSD2 (Payment Services Directive), leaving a question mark after the name of the European standard. Why would someone in the payments space be unsure of this?

Apologies to readers of my first comment, which lacked references and probably just seemed like some sort of personal attack. *Now* it's no longer BS, but a harsh, but well-supported criticism of someone who probably understands marketing and the general Omise vision better than the payments space.

If this hypothesis is sound then it will be one more feather in the cap for the general neoreactionary theory of history. To begin with, I'm going to walk through our ""discovery"" process and then talk about the prospects. The following is only a rough and ready outline. 

Ok so we were re-reading the following the other day: 

http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.co.uk/2007/08/james-burnhams-dante-politics-as-wish.html

And this jumped out:

The Guelph faction took its name from the party of Lothair; and the Ghibelline, from the party of the Hohenstaufen. The exact significance of the division varied from period to period, but in general line-up and most of the time, the Guelphs were the party of the Papacy, the Ghibellines, the party of the Empire. On the whole, the greater feudal nobles were Ghibellines, especially in the Germanic states and in Italy. As a counterweight to them, the Pope brought many of the Italian city-states into the Guelph camp, in particular the rising burgher class of the city-states, which was already in internal conflict with the great nobles at home. This distinction, however, holds only in general; often adherence to one or other of the factions was a device to secure special and temporary advantages independent of the over-all division. For example, the House of France during the 13th century inclined toward the Guelphs in order to secure leverage against the Empire. Two of the junior members of the French royal family, Charles of Anjou and Charles of Valois, were among the leading champions of the Guelphs. The Italian cities, similarly, often chose sides in such a way as to aid them most in meeting local and immediate problems.

High&amp;Low V Middle. 



""As a counterweight to them, the Pope brought many of the Italian city-states into the Guelph camp, in particular the rising burgher class of the city-states, which was already in internal conflict with the great nobles at home.""

However, this is not the idea. This observation got us thinking about the role that the Popes have played in history. Started thinking about the Protestant Reformation. Started thinking about Luther complaining about the indulgences. This led us to ask the question: Why did the Catholic Church need the money? We formed an induction that the reason why the Catholic Church needed money was for war-making. This was the hypothesis formed. We then went in search of some plausible evidence that would give some support for this induction. 

Started with this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indulgence#Late_medieval_abuses
Then: "" With the permission of the Church, indulgences also became a way for Catholic rulers to fund expensive projects, such as Crusades and cathedrals, ...""


""Crusades""

This led to: https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=1054
Library : The Historical Origin of Indulgences



The Historical Origin of Indulgences Reflection on the Bull Incarnationis Mysterium.  

""In this problematic transition, however, the ""Crusade"" indulgences (which we mentioned earlier) were particularly significant, since to a great extent they led the way to the plenary indulgence. Paulus9 gives a complete and very informative list of them.""

""particularly significant""



In 1063 Alexander II granted a remission of punishment for those who fought the Moors; in order to rouse Christians for the First Crusade, Urban II declared at the Council of Clermont in 1095 that participation in the Crusade was equivalent to a complete penance: ""Paenitentiam totam peccatorum, de quibus veram et perfectam confessionem fecerint ... auctoritate dimittimus"".

""remission of punishment for those who fought the Moors""

Then we have this interesting claim: ""It was precisely the plenary indulgence of the Crusades that led to the idea of the plenary indulgence for the Jubilee.""

What's this?

But the faithful had already begun to apply the indulgences they had been granted to the souls of the dead as well. It is clear that around 1350 the practice of applying the Jubilee, Crusade and ""Portiuncula"" indulgences to the dead was widespread. The ecclesiastical authorities, however, did not yet grant these indulgences, although there was the practice of granting an indulgence to the living if they prayed for the dead. Only in 1457 did Callistus III grant King Henry IV of Castille a plenary indulgence for the living and, for those who would pay 200 maravedi (a former currency in the Iberian countries) for the Crusade against the Moors, an indulgence for the dead. But the Bull remained unknown outside Spain, where it in fact caused a great deal of surprise.

In 1476 Sixtus IV granted a Bull for the cathedral of Saintes, France, valid for 10 years, with a plenary indulgence for the living and, in modum suffragii, also for the dead. Regarding the application of indulgences to the dead, there has been a long discussion as to whether the application to the person occurs with certainty or only if it is graciously accepted by God; the latter thesis prevailed.

1.	Abuses


But another aspect of indulgences was connected with almsgiving. Permission began to be granted to Catholic kings and princes, particularly on the occasion of Crusades, to retain for themselves a rather considerable part of the alms collected for the gaining of indulgences. Later on, similar permission was frequently granted for many other projects, and princes were not always too scrupulous. The most well-known and debated question is the indulgence granted for building the new St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.


""St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.""


Started looking into this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Peter%27s_Basilica#The_Plan_to_Rebuild
""In 1505 Julius made a decision to demolish the ancient basilica and replace it with a monumental structure to house his enormous tomb and ""aggrandize himself in the popular imagination""""

Who?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Julius_II

"" born Giuliano della Rovere, and nicknamed ""The Fearsome Pope""[1] and ""The Warrior Pope"",""

""The Warrior Pope""


His papacy was marked by an active foreign policy, ambitious building projects, and patronage of the arts—he commissioned the destruction and rebuilding of St. Peter's Basilica, and Michelangelo's decoration of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. In addition to an active military policy, he personally led troops into battle on at least two occasions,

The same year, he founded the Swiss Guard to provide a constant corps of soldiers to protect the Pope.

The Essentials. 

""Julius II entered Rome . . . both as a second Julius Caesar, heir to the majesty of Rome's imperial glory, and in the likeness of Christ, whose vicar the pope was, and who in that capacity governed the universal Roman Church.""[23] Julius, who modelled himself after his namesake Caesar, would personally lead his army across the Italian peninsula under the imperial war-cry, ""Drive out the barbarians.""


However, it was this Pope during the time of Luther: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Leo_X
n 1517 he led a costly war that succeeded in securing his nephew as duke of Urbino, but which damaged the papal finances. 

"" damaged the papal finances.""

He borrowed and spent heavily. A significant patron of the arts, upon election Leo is alleged to have said, ""Since God has given us the papacy, let us enjoy it.""

""borrowed and spent heavily.""

On 3 July 1517 he published the names of thirty-one new cardinals, a number almost unprecedented in the history of the papacy. Among the nominations were such notable men such as Lorenzo Campeggio, Giambattista Pallavicini, Adrian of Utrecht, Thomas Cajetan, Cristoforo Numai and Egidio Canisio. The naming of seven members of prominent Roman families, however, reversed the policy of his predecessor which had kept the political factions of the city out of the Curia. Other promotions were for political or family considerations or to secure money for the war against Urbino. The pope was accused of having exaggerated the conspiracy of the cardinals for purposes of financial gain, but most of such accusations appear unsubstantiated.

"" secure money for the war against Urbino.""

""exaggerated the conspiracy of the cardinals for purposes of financial gain,""

Cardinal Wolsey made England, not the pope, the arbiter between France and the Empire; and much of the money collected for the crusade from tithes and indulgences was spent in other ways.[
In response to concerns about misconduct from some indulgence preachers, in 1517 Martin Luther wrote his Ninety-five Theses on the topic of indulgences. The resulting pamphlet spread Luther's ideas throughout Germany and Europe. Leo failed to fully comprehend the importance of the movement, and in February 1518 he directed the vicar-general of the Augustinians to impose silence on his monks

So, the hypothesis is that, just like with the English Civil War and the French Revolution, the Reformation was a consequence of disagreements and resentments over taxing, financing and revenue generation for the purpose of making war. 

War makes the state and the state makes war. 

The Minotaur of War.

Think of Julius Caesar. One of the primary reasons why he had to raise hell and make a profit in Gaul was to pay off his debts. 

Now, there is a theory (undecided) that the real reason for the American Civil War was that the north wanted to crush the south because they were an economic and thus a political threat. They used the Low (and literally ""Expendable"") Black slaves as a formal excuse. 

So, the research question would be: how much of a weight did the Catholic Church's (or Pope's) need to generate revenue in order to wage war play in causing the Protestant Reformation?

Rounda isn't really a freak. She looks like a kid  when compared to Nia. So, the better utilization of Heyman will be to pair him with Nia &amp; push her as an unstoppable force.

Poi l'appartenenza è davvero qualcosa di personale: parlando con un mio amico è venuto fuori che lui si sentiva in primo luogo Europeo poi Siciliano e infine Italiano, mentre nel mio caso io mi sento principalmente Europeo anche se gran parte del mio background culturale è italiano. 

Poi dipende ancora da cosa intendi per cultura, per quanto mi riguarda mi pare che i principali stati Europei condividano i valori fondamentali della loro cultura, alla fine storicamente e culturalmente l'europa è sempre stata molto intrecciata ed è anche uno dei motivi per cui un associazione come l'UE esiste in primo luogo, proprio perché riconosciamo qualcosa di comune nella nostra cultura anche se ci sono evidenti diversità questo non compromette il senso di appartenenza in nessun modo.
Così come un italiano puo sentirsi siciliano o lombardo un europeo potrà sentirsi italiano o tedesco avendo comunque in comune dei valori cruciali.

È una questione di gerarchia secondo me: 
a un livello generale i paesi europei riconoscono l'importanza di valori come libertà, democrazia parità delle opportunità etc... poi su un livello nazionale puoi avere qualcosa di più specifico tipo l'importanza dei valori cristiani o robe del genere e così via al livello regionale, comunale fino ad arrivare ai valori familiari. 

Francamente vedendo la deriva sempre più estrema di Usa, Russia e Cina, la posizione di leadership morale dei paesi europei con i valori che sono accettati da più o meno tutta la comunità mi pare evidente (almeno dal punto di vista che ho come cittadino europeo, quindi abbastanza bias).

Per concludere non credo ci sia una nemesi tra italianità e comunità Europea perché di fatto l'ue non vuole omogeneità, ma una condivisione di valori generali ( diciamo essere d'accordo sui primi articoli della costituzione; quelli con valore ideologico e basta)

False,TheTwentyFirst,LUflair,,3adè,"First off, let me lead with apologizing for taking this long to reply, you provided a massive amount of links (many of which turned out to be hour-long videos), and I lazily kept putting it off. But anyway.

First Link: Thank you for proving yourself wrong for me? The guy thinks addressing people with their own choice of pronoun is an infringement on his free speech. This is a golden example of the privileged fearing and resisting change simply because it benefits someone else in the power hierarchy. How does simply complying with a trans person's wishes for their gender to be recognized affect him? Why does he feel the need to make decisions for these people? Pathetic.

Second Link: The hearing regarding the bill to disallow discrimination based on gender. Discrimination being the keyword here. I have no idea how you painted this as some Orwellian ruling that will obliterate free speech, the content of that bill is simply: don't be an asshole. You're reacting to it the same way a slave owner would have reacted to a ""please acknowledge your slaves as human beings"" bill. Thanks again for making my points for me?

Third Link: This lunatic is growing on my by now, after listening to him for so long, I wouldn't paint him as an advocate of free speech though, because his speech is just vitriol and ad homonym attacks, a 25 minute video that boils down to him calling people who disagree with him degenerates. Nice. Modern exchange of ideas people.

Fourth Link: This video is pretty misleading, whatever the truth may be, showing a shouting contest between the students and the professor, painting the students as hooligans terrorizing him is just propaganda. With that said, I agree with what the professor said, that a day of absence is a call to consciousness, and to address the heroism of people of color after what they have suffered, while the new twist on the day of absence, is more or less oppressive. These students were motivated by rage after their idea, which I'm sure wasn't meant to be racist, just a twist on their school's tradition, and became what they fear, an oppressive mob. This is the first time where you present something mildly concerning about the extreme left, and as it should be. Extremism is bad wherever found.

Fifth Link: This is hilarious, I'm actually in tears, thanks for the comedic break after that grim 4th link. An actual sexist, fired for his sexist opinions, protests and claims to be the victim. I'm almost speechless. The guy literally rants on in 10 pages, arguing that gender gaps in the technology workforce shouldn’t just be attributed to sexism, but also to the “fact” that women are less equipped to handle the industry than men. Wow. Just wow. So he not only supports the gender gap, but thinks it's supported ""by facts"". Freedom of speech protects you from the government, and ensures your right to express your opinion. It doesn't protect you from the consequences of that opinion. You don't sexist things then complain about being fired for being sexist. This is absolutely hilarious.

Sixth Link: Jordan Peterson again, I think I gave this lunatic enough time and effort in the previous videos about him, I don't understand why you brought him up, what, 3-4 times now? 
Sidenote I love his hate for postmodernism, can't hate a man who openly says I'm afraid of change, regardless of what it might be, especially when he holds pseudo-fascist ideals (not fascist, just almost, because of the need to impose his opinions).

Seventh Link: You posted the same link again. Geez you sure are a fan f this guy.

Eighth Link: I'm not sure I wanna take the word of a channel that has a video named ""The war on boys"" (The idea that effeminate men  are the driving force behind collapsing societies is as old as medieval Europe and just absurd, even if it is funny). But unlike your best friend Jordan Peterson, I'll refrain from ad homonym attacks.
This has been examined multiple times, and people still refer to the wrong, old study about wage gaps, when arguing against it. It's like arguing against evolution today, using only what Darwin thought about it. In truth we came to understand much more about the gender pay gap and evolution in recent years, who would've known?
The current gender wage gap comes not from overtly paying less to females holding the same jobs as their male peers, but from male privilege allowing them to gain higher paid jobs in the first place. Things like hiring discrimination, social pressure for women to decrease their work hours, and opportunities for promotions favoring men.
Read this to better understand it:
http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/goldin/files/dynamics_of_the_gender_gap_for_young_professionals_in_the_financial_and_corporate_sectors.pdf
Was this even in what we were arguing about? Did you just google ""anti-liberalism"" and copy paste the first 13 links?

Ninth Link: Other than this being 7 years old, it just reinforces the idea that the patriarchy still reigns in the most ""equal"" country? I was gonna make the point that we really should be looking at feminism and sexism in the middle east since we are on r/Lebanon but this just shows that gender roles still rule even when there is apparent equality. Women's societal pressures drive them away from manual jobs while men flock to these low-requirement high-effort jobs to secure their futures. This also features toxic masculinity where you'd see men who will support this structure by saying that they need to protect and provide for the women. 
Stop linking videos that make my own point I'm here for that.

Tenth Link: I'm getting tired by now, and since you didn't offer any commentary and just linked videos to do your bidding for you, I'm assuming that's fair game, the article you linked is a scapegoat train of thought that does not explore the intricacies of crime in black communities. Here's a better version 
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GWwiUIVpmNY
(And my videos are entertaining at least, not hours of senseless debate, you're welcome).

11th, 12th, and 13th Links:
Let me be honest here, I'm beyond glad you repeated your points lol, I already spent too much time on this. For all of these, refer to the video linked in the ""Tenth Link"" part. That covers them all.
But also just a little commentary on that, it's always curious to me when people make the argument that statistically, black people commit more crimes in the US. Why do you think that happens?
Are you openly admitting racism and saying that ""well, it's cause they're black! Their race predisposes them to crime!"", or, do you believe, rationally, that there is an underlying cause of this, as discussed in the video, that white privilege is at play here, and these historically marginalized communities cannot simply ""grow up"" overnight.


In conclusion: 
Every link you posted, minus the Bert Weinstein one, has a contradicting, sorry to say, better point to make, I really hope you either have your mind swayed a bit, not necessarily change your view of them, just put more thought into it, and, if you'd like to, extensively argue a specific point directly. (Just be specific cause these lengthy points are just tiring lol).

Have a good day, and again, sorry for the late reply, hope yours comes sooner.

False,[deleted],,,,"*Ce mercredi sort «Gaston Lagaffe» au cinéma. Une sortie qu’on a vendue et défendue chez Dupuis. Question de gros sous. Isabelle Franquin, la fille d’André, regrette, elle, cet énorme gâchis, indigne du travail de son créateur. Et espère que le public ne confondra pas «le bon grain avec l’ivraie».*

*Isabelle Franquin, avez-vous vu le film de Pierre-François Martin-Laval (PEF)?*

J’ai été forcée dans l’exercice du droit moral que j’exerce toujours sur l’œuvre de mon père depuis qu’il a vendu les droits patrimoniaux en 1986 et 1992 à Jean-François Moyersoen (NDLR: homme d’affaires monégasque et fondateur de Marsu Productions, qui les a lui-même revendus à Dupuis en 2013).

*En quoi avez-vous été associée au projet?*

La conception de ce film et la vente de ses droits ne sont pas de mon fait. C’est d’ailleurs une chose que je n’aurais pas faite si ça n’avait tenu qu’à moi. Il ne me reste que le droit moral, lequel m’a permis d’avoir accès au scénario. Et sa première version était inqualifiable, pleine d’aberrations: Gaston y abandonnait son chat et sa mouette. Ou chauffait la start-up où il travaille en introduisant un tuyau d’arrosage dans le derrière d’une vache. Quand on sait la manière dont Gaston traite ses animaux et la façon dont mon père les a mis en scène dans ses séries, sérieusement…

*Vous leur avez fait part de ces remarques? Et ils en ont tenu compte?*

Là, j’ai dit «niet», à ça et une série d’autres détails du même acabit. Et de manière assez abrupte, d’ailleurs, je dois bien le dire. Mais bon, ce scénario était vraiment mauvais. Déjà, placer Gaston dans le contexte actuel, au sein d’une start-up, était une mauvaise idée. C’est comme le couper de son biotope naturel qu’est la rédaction de Spirou. Mais le droit moral, s’il a le mérite d’exister, est assez restreint. Et ne me permet de modifier que quelques détails, tandis que je suis quand même obligée de m’incliner devant d’autres choses. Je n’avais donc pas le pouvoir d’empêcher ce film., même si les acteurs sont mal dirigés, le scénario débile et le rythme des gags catastrophique.

*Vous avez eu des contacts réguliers avec la production? Et Pierre-François Martin-Laval (et interprète de Prunelle, l’autre personnage principal du film)?*

PEF, dès que j’ai reçu son scénario, je n’avais plus du tout envie de le rencontrer. Et je ne l’ai, donc, jamais rencontré. Le producteur, je l’ai vu deux fois. Et je dois dire qu’il a été très franc avec moi: il m’a dit qu’il serait impossible de placer Gaston à l’époque où il a été créé, car le contexte d’une rédaction de journal ne parlerait plus aux jeunes d’aujourd’hui. Il a ajouté que les décors coûteraient aussi moins cher si l’action se déroulait à notre époque. Il a notamment cité Le petit Nicolas, dont l’adaptation se déroulait dans les années 60, et qui avait coûté très cher. Ce qui n’avait pas empêché le deuxième volet de se planter royalement.

*On sent que ce naufrage vous fait mal…*

Ça fait mal, très mal même, car j’assiste impuissante au désastre, en espérant de tout cœur que le public saura distinguer le bon grain de l’ivraie, si je puis dire.

*Quel objectif poursuit, selon vous, Dupuis à travers ce type d’adaptation?*

Dupuis, ou plutôt Média-Participations, sa maison-mère, espère que le film attirera un nouveau jeune public, les 8-10 ans d’aujourd’hui, et que l’on renouvellera ainsi le cheptel de lecteurs. Leur problème avec Gaston, c’est qu’on ne peut plus le faire revivre puisque mon père a bien dit, de son vivant, qu’il ne voulait pas qu’on poursuive ses aventures après lui. C’est, en quelque sorte, un personnage «mort». Mais moi, je pense qu’on peut continuer à le faire exister autrement, en multipliant les initiatives, comme la restauration des couleurs des albums Gaston ou les expositions au C.B.B.D, au Centre Wallonie Bruxelles et à la Bibliothèque du Centre Pompidou à Paris.

*Les porteurs du projet de film disent pourtant être des «amoureux» de l’œuvre de votre père…*

Oui, mais ça, c’est la rhétorique habituelle: ces gens-là n’aiment rien tant que de sortir les violons pour dire leur amour de son œuvre. Mais derrière, il n’y a généralement rien, sauf un appétit pour le lucre. Dans ce cas-ci, c’était assez notable. Et dans le cas, plus précis, de PEF, on peut se demander si ce type a jamais lu un seul album de Gaston. Ce qui m’embête le plus, avec ce genre d’initiative, c’est la dilution du personnage dans des entreprises commerciales comme celles-là. C’est préjudiciable. Il y a peut-être moyen de faire un bon film à partir de Gaston, mais pas comme ça. À la limite, le Fais gaffe à la gaffe de Paul Boujenah (NDLR: sorti en 1981) était plus proche de l’esprit Gaston que celui de PEF. Alors que, franchement, ce n’était déjà pas une franche réussite.

*Pourquoi elle ne peut rien faire*

En France comme en Belgique, le droit d’auteur se divise en deux catégories: le droit moral et le droit patrimonial. Le droit moral protège les intérêts «non économiques» d’un auteur.

Soit, par exemple, le droit au respect de l’intégrité d’une œuvre. Les droits patrimoniaux, cédés par André Franquin à Jean-François Moyersoen en 1986 et 1992 concernant Gaston Lagaffe mais repassés dans le giron de Dupuis à leur rachat en 2013, permettent à son détenteur d’exploiter l’œuvre en question comme bon lui semble à des fins économiques. Ne disposant plus, pour lutter, que du seul droit moral, Isabelle Franquin ne pouvait donc pas s’opposer, légalement, au tournage de Gaston Lagaffe.
PEF: «Ça a été lourd à porter»

Réalisateur de cette adaptation (ratée) qui a été « lourde à porter », Pierre-François Martin-Laval, alias PEF, vient néanmoins contredire Isabelle Franquin: il est un vrai amoureux de Gaston Lagaffe: «C’est un mélange de burlesque de poésie et d’absurde. Et ça, c’est tout ce que j’aime. » L’ex-Robin des Bois savait, quoi qu’il en soit, que ce projet susciterait un rejet fort: «Et c’est bien normal: c’est une BD culte. Moi-même, si on m’avait dit: ‘‘Tel réalisateur va adapter Gaston’’, je crois que j’aurais eu des préjugés. Pas la violence de certains, qui n’ont d’ailleurs pas vu le film, mais je n’aurais pas pu m’empêcher de me dire: dans quoi s’embarque-t-il? Puis de me demander: a-t-on vraiment besoin de ça?» Et puisqu’il fait les réponses et les questions, on va le laisser répondre à celle-ci: « Il ne faut pas, mais… on peut. Car quand c’est réussi, ça fait tellement plaisir… » Du plaisir, on peut le lire ci-dessous, Isabelle Franquin en a pris fort peu. Mais là aussi, PEF relativise: «On m’a rapporté qu’elle a trouvé que j’étais resté fidèle à l’univers de son père. Et la preuve, c’est qu’elle a laissé le nom de son père au générique, alors qu’elle aurait pu demander à le faire enlever.»

Edit: from another article (translated loosely by me):

""The simulator is a result of Slovenian knowledge - it was developed by AEREFORM company and AERONAVT flight academy""

This definitely makes it sound like they fully developed the software side, which I have a gripe with. Give credits where it's due.

Edit2: another example of this (translated loosely by me):

(at first) you could fly the simulator only by piloting yourself. Many people were affraid to use it because of this. So before moving it into the museum we **upgraded** it. **We developed an autopilot** for those who just want to ride the plane and watch the scenery.

False,kriptonicx,,5abe77de-24f8-11e5-bb11-0ef63926eacd,"Can't we talk about this? [-0.5, -1.85]","Thanks for sharing this. It's always interesting to hear what reasoning people have to not accept that population replacement is happening. Here are the key arguments and my thoughts. I'd be interested to know where/if you personally disagree.

Argument: ""Trends won’t continue""

They don’t need to. Around 40% of births in the UK are already non-white-British. We'll only need a relatively low amount of immigration going forward, or a slight difference in native/non-native birth rates for the indigenous population to become an absolute minority in the UK.

Argument: ""More white people are alive than ever""

Whilst it’s difficult to know for sure given the wide range of population estimates for pre-Columbian America it’s possible that there are more native Americans alive today than there ever was before Europeans settled. Another fairly obvious point to make is simply saying more Jews are alive today than before WWII doesn’t mean the holocaust didn’t happen.

Argument: ""Everyone who believes the UK population is being replaced believes it's a Jewish conspiracy""

This isn’t true. I’m not even sure what reasoning he has for this - he doesn’t provide anyway. There is certainly a branch of people who believe Jews are responsible for everything but population displacement is happening in the UK and across Europe. This argument doesn’t invalid any of the data on this. There are also some scientists who deny climate change for silly reasons, that doesn’t mean all scientists are wrong, or those who believe in climate change secretly in deny it which he seems to suggest.

Argument: ""You’re not replacing people, you’re just adding other people""

Yes, obviously, but this doesn’t mean whites won’t become an increasingly smaller minority in their homelands if trends continue. This is why I prefer using the word ""displacement"". If you add water to milk you're not replacing or genociding the milk, but if you continue to add water for long enough what you're going to be left with is effectively no longer milk.

Argument: ""White-British people will still be the largest minority after they become a minority""

I wasn’t sure if he was agreeing the white-British population is being replaced at this point or not. Do you not think this is a really weird argument against those claiming population replacement? Admitting that it’s happening, but suggesting it's okay because they will remain the largest minority for a while?

Argument: ""People who migrate to Britain and are born in Britain are British""

And with that Naive American population just sky rocketed.

Argument: ""Some of the sources Lauren Southern used aren’t reputable""

Okay, maybe they're not. There are enough reputable sources that demonstrate that it's happening that this isn't really an argument against it. Just like how some people use silly arguments and sources when trying to prove climate change, it doesn't mean they're wrong. He also goes off on some weird tangent about how deportations are unpractical because one source mentioned it, which may be true, but it's totally irrelevant to whether or population replacement is happening or not.

Argument: ""The “great replacement” is the replacement of a population in the space of a single generation""

I think this is a silly phase and a silly definition personally. He also seems to prove it will take longer than a single generation by using population and immigration data that only includes muslims immigrants. Why? This seems really selective and dishonest. Is anyone arguing that Muslims are going to be the majority of the UK population anytime soon? But again even if this was true it doesn't disprove anything. It just means it's going to take a few generations, instead of one. Again is he’s arguing for, or against population replacement being a thing? This is a really strange argument for someone who denies it's happening.

Argument: ""Caring about race or ethnicity of your people being replaced is racist""

I disagree. I believe all people have the right to maintain their ethnicity, culture and land such they wish. I don't know what else to say here except from I just simply disagree with this as a matter of morality.

Argument: ""It’s enviable so accept it""

It’s not enviable because this is only happening in Europe. Again here he literally seems to admit the UK population isn't going to remain the same and the people who have inhabited this land for thousands of years will soon disappear. Is he arguing for or against it? It seems he believes population replacement is a thing, but has no moral problems with it which seems morally messed up to me, especially considering it's non-consensual.

Argument: ""White people are already a minority population in the world""

I can’t even get mad. What an amazing piece of logic. You have to wonder what are those silly black people talking about when they claim they're oppressed minorities?

O STF falou que o cara poderia recorrer em liberdade. Nem preciso dizer que a pena prescreveu no STJ.

Voltou-se ao antigo entendimento em 2016 por pressão popular e a única coisa decente feita na presidencia da Carmen Lúcia no STF.


Como é no resto do mundo?


Boa parte do mundo civilizado permite a pena nas primeiras duas instancias, em quase nenhum lugar tem uma quarta instancia como a nossa, e muito menos a demora em média de 7 anos para julgar um simples recurso nestes tribunais.

Há de se pautar na realidade social em que [40% dos presos são provisórios](https://www.conjur.com.br/2016-abr-26/40-presos-brasileiros-sao-provisorios-aponta-levantamento). Esses dados foram coletados enquanto o entendimento era da inocencia até o transito em julgado. Escancara-se então que a prisão é somente para os 3 P's. Preto, pobre e prostituta.

O único argumento para apoiar esse julgamento de encomenda é pura doutrina positivista e complacencia com crime de colarinho branco, porque esses predominantemente são os únicos tipos de crime em que os réus conseguem recorrer para o STJ e o STF.

Fica ainda mais patético quando voce percebe que os Recursos para esses tribunais não reanalisam provas ou o mérito, isso fica na primeira e na segunda instancia.

Outro argumento ridículo é que isso iria encher ainda mais as cadeias, mas não tem nenhuma base. O dado que eu trouxe de 40% dos presos sendo provisórios já mostra a realidade que esse entendimento não vai influenciar em nada na parcela menos privilegiada e sim somente para os advogados que já tem esquemas com ministros.

Pode ver os argumentos de quem apoia o julgamento de encomenda, é só ""claúsula pétrea, vamos confiar na via institucional, quem pode mudar o entendimento é o Congresso."" Não ponderam nenhum dos problemas que eu citei, não trazem exemplos pragmáticos e realistas do Brasil. Só querem regurgitar a lavagem cerebral que sofreram na faculdade, ou se escondem na falsa pauta humanista para legitimar o apoio de algum corrupto favorito que tem.

Sure. As it was under every econoimc system in history. Feudalism had people paying for stuff and working for money as well. 

But capitalism is a lot younger than that, and traces it origins to a few specific economic innovations that either emerged or reached the west during the renassaince. Things like the tradable shareholder ownership of companies (a dutch invention), the trading of third party debt (also a british invention), the trading of risk (an italian invention), and the emergence of things like formal legal contracts (and the trading thereon), and so on.   

Then there are the emergence of modern banking and accounting practices, which also emerged in the renaissance in Holland and italy respectively. 

These are the specific nuts and bolts which economic historians consider to be the actual instituions that comprise a capitalist economy. All of them emerged during renaissance-era europe.

Cum a spus Barack Dumitru Obama, fii schimbarea pe care o vrei. Din punct de vedere moral, nu poti sa arati spre baronii pesede si sa ii condamni cand si tu faci acelasi lucru, dar la alt nivel. Sigur ca la nivel practic, este diferenta intre un ou si un bou, dar tine de mentalitate. Si mentalitatea asta are radacini in istorie - lipsurile din timpurile regimului comunist, incepand cu foametea din '46, trecand prin rationalizarea tuturor chestiilor pe vremea lu' ceasca si pana la ""generatiile de sacrificiu"" de dupa '89. Ca si popor, am fost, in majoritate, conditionati de supravietuire. Altii au intrat in sistem si cu pupat in cur au ajuns in esalonul superior unde se fura la alt nivel - cu tonele, nu pentru supravietuire, ci pentru ca se putea. 

As lega mentalitatea asta specific romaneasca de comunism - am petrecut prea mult timp in regimul asta. Dar a trecut, nu mai suntem acolo, putem fi altfel. Pot rationaliza de ce mama isi oprea un pui cand venea marfa la alimentara - ca voia sa ne faca si noua o ciorba decenta. Dar nu mai e necesar sa traim asa, putem trai si corect. Si atata timp cat noi nu suntem corecti fata de oricine si orice, nu o sa se schimbe mare lucru. E greu sa gandesti corect cand anumite nevoi iti bat la usa. Ai nevoie de bani pentru chirie sau utilitati sau transport, iti permiti 10 euroi pentru un joc sau un abonament la netflix? Daca nu, si totusi vrei chestia aia, luxul ala, si o poti obtine ilegal, ce faci? Te gandesti, pai, nu fac rau la nimeni. Dar faci rau, iti faci rau tie din punct de vedere moral, cu fiecare decizie cu care mai impingi un pic granita dintre corect si incorect. E greu, dar... pula mea. Asa invingi mentalitati.

Sigur, discutia e mai complexa in exemplul dat cu jocurile sau filmele, gen sunt giganti ca Electronic Arts sau Ubisoft care parca te roaga sa le piratezi jocurile, pentru ca atunci cand le cumperi legal, esti mai dezavantajat decat un pirat - dai 60 de euro ca sa ai 3 copy-protections instalate in sistem, care o sa faca jocul sa-ti mearga ca un cur. Sau diferenta de continut intre un abonat netflix din US si unul din RO, care plateste mai mult decat ala din US si primeste un sfert din continut. Sau sunt seriale/filme care pur si simplu nu le gasesti in Romania, ca-s pe Hulu sau stiu eu ce platforma care nu exista la noi. 

Ideea de baza insa ramane ca pentru un studio de filme sau jocuri, daca iei cu laba, pui botul si inghiti oul cu totul, tu esti un soi de dragnea. Si asta trebuie schimbat. Acolo se incepe.

I know it's not technically Montreal, but if you want to know how to integrate as an anglophone, you might want to ask the more anglophone subreddit /r/Montreal. Try looking at some language learning subreddits too. 

I think in terms of integration, learning the language and commiting to continue to learn the language, and making that noticible to the Francos around you, is 70% of the battle here. This will not be easy. First because learning your second language as an adult is really hard. Second because the temptation will always be there to just revert to English, because you technically can. Third, and this is more of a theory of mine, we ROC Anglos have very little exposure to French or a culture of learning another language like many Europeans or Québécois. Fourth it's easy to just stop learning after the course. Fifth, even if your French is good, many will switch to English if they hear your accent. If you're confident you can keep going in French, keep going in French,

Get motivated by wanting to watch Québécois TV shows. They're quite cool. Use subtitles at first.

Learning the history of Quebec is also kind of useful to understand why the political culture is the way it is. It's very important to them in a way it isn't for us. That could be another 15% of the battle. I generally avoid political discussions at work for now.

And ... look ... generalizations, insensitivity, anger, it's always something you vaguely disapprove of, but it becomes a bit more jarring and memorable when you're the target and you're the numerical minority, even if it happens super rarely. Remember most people aren't like this, damn near everyone doesn't want to be like this at heart, and also that you generally win over more people with a friendly attitude. And speaking French.

False,Mordreadd,,,,"&gt; Sou contra pena de morte. Não acho que eles devam ser mortos.
&gt; 
&gt; Mas não consigo acreditar que alguém que faz isso seja recuperável. Não vejo como isso seria possível.

&amp;nbsp;

Mas então, o quê você espera que aconteça com essas pessoas irrecuperáveis?

Tem uma passagem muito boa (bom, tem várias) no livro 'Tropas Estelares' de Robert A. Heinlein. Não se deixe enganar pelos filmes tenebrosos que fizeram, eles não tem absolutamente nada a ver com o quê o livro trata.

Mas seguindo em frente, durante o treinamento do protagonista, ele testemunha a condenação de um outro recruta que desertou e  depois sequestrou e matou uma garotinha. Depois de assistir a execução, de volta ao alojamento ele pensa sobre o acontecido:

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; ele parecia um sujeito comum, e o seu comportamento e registro não podiam ser muito estranhos ou ele nunca teria chegado ao Acampamento Currie. Suponho que fosse uma daquelas
&gt; personalidades patológicas que a gente lê a respeito - não há jeito de identificá-los.
&gt; 
&gt; Bem, se não havia jeito de evitar que isso acontecesse uma vez, havia um jeito certo de impedir que acontecesse duas vezes. O que tínhamos usado.
&gt; 
&gt; Se Dillinger entendia o que estava fazendo (o que parecia difícil de acreditar) então entendeu o que ia receber... exceto que era uma vergonha que não tivesse sofrido tanto quanto a pequena Barbara Anne - ele praticamente não tinha sofrido. Mas suponha, como parecia mais provável, que ele era tão louco que nunca teve consciência de que estava fazendo algo errado? Então o quê?
&gt; 
&gt; Bem, nós atiramos em cachorros loucos, não é?
&gt; 
&gt; Sim, mas estar louco daquele jeito é uma doença... Eu podia ver apenas duas possibilidades. Ou ele não podia ser curado - caso em que estava melhor morto para seu próprio bem e a segurança dos outros - ou podia ser tratado e tornado são. Neste caso (eu achava) se ele algum
&gt; dia ficasse são o bastante para a sociedade civilizada... e pensasse sobre o que tinha feito enquanto estava ""doente"" - o que restaria a ele além do suicídio? Como poderia viver
&gt; com ele mesmo? E suponha que ele escapasse antes que estivesse curado e fizesse a mesma coisa de novo? 
&gt; 
&gt; E quem sabe de novo? 
&gt; 
&gt; Como você explica isso para pais despojados de suas crianças? Em vista do passado dele?
&gt; 
&gt; Eu podia ver apenas uma resposta.

&amp;nbsp;

Digamos que esses criminosos fujam ou daqui a alguns anos sejam liberados. E que eles voltem a cometer o mesmo crime e matem alguém. Segundo você (e pra falar a verdade, eu também) eles são irrecuperáveis. Se eles matarem novamente, não somos nós indiretamente responsáveis por isso? 

Com que moral eu poderia olhar nos olhos de uma mãe e dizer ""sua filha não está aqui hoje porque eu achei que essas pessoas podiam voltar a liberdade... *mesmo que eu achasse que eles iriam fazer de novo* (irrecuperáveis)"".

&amp;nbsp;

Por outro lado, eu não confio na capacidade das pessoas como um todo, para julgar se alguém merece a pena de morte ou não. Erros podem (e seriam) cometidos. Por isso me vejo nesse impasse: eu apóio a pena de morte, só não vejo como poderíamos implementá-la.

False,OneWordPlastic,,,,Yeah no offense but you sound like one of those european dudes who bash america but listen to shitty rap and wear a new york hat. Every country has pros and cons. For example the USA is fairly lax on immigration while its nearly impossible for an uneducated person to get a canadian citizenship. Also while alot of americans cant afford health care ours tends to be better and people all over europe and canada come to the USA for health care. Also since we are the policemen of the world other countries dont spend much on military so they have more money for social programs. We have great universities but shitty k-12. And the extreme 2nd amendment people who want all that crazy stuff only came about in the 80s. The NRA used to be reasonable. Finally when it comes to news bad/fear tactic news sells most americans want gun control but head lines about how stupid americans are sell more.,True,False,0,1522769343,,False,0,dwqg7m3,False,t3_89allp,True,t1_dwpu33f,/r/unpopularopinion/comments/89allp/americansdo_they_know/dwqg7m3/,,1525912268,2,False,True,False,unpopularopinion,t5_2tk0s,public,

We chat on discord and organise stuff there and on the 100. We're a gaming community so you don't have to play Destiny only.

False,penmarkrhoda,beginner,,Beginner,"&gt;What has the left ever offered? National Concealed Carry reciprocity? Lifting the bans already in place on types of firearms available? Zip. Nada. All you do is take.

Except that is the exact opposite of what any reasonable person wants? States have different laws on concealed carry -- some states have standards, others do not, and states have different rules about who is and is not allowed to have a gun. For instance, in Michigan, which is a ""shall issue"" state, a person [convicted of misdemeanor stalking](http://www.eclectablog.com/2017/07/concealed-weapons-for-convicted-stalkers-what-could-go-wrong-michigan-republicans-say.html) can own a gun and have a concealed carry license. I know three women who have moved to different states because they have stalkers and need to live in an area where their stalker can't walk around with a gun. Reciprocity would kill that option, which is the ONLY option some women have. It's a shitty option, but at least it exists. It would only make sense if all states had the same standards, which they do not.

&gt;Gun confiscation will only disarm the law-abiding citizens. It won't disarm the criminals.

BULLSHIT. This has been disproven by literally every single country that has comprehensive gun control. This *only* happens here. Are you literally incapable of looking around and seeing that? Where are the mass shootings occurring? AMERICA. Nowhere else. They don't happen in other places. They don't happen in Europe, they don't happen in Australia. They don't happen in Asia. They happen HERE. None of those other countries needs armed teachers, because they do not have this problem to begin with.

The military history of France encompasses an immense panorama of conflicts and struggles extending for more than 2,000 years across areas including modern France, the European continent, and a variety of regions throughout the world.

According to historian Niall Ferguson: ""of the 125 major European wars fought since 1495, the French have participated in 50 – more than Austria (47) and England (43). Out of 168 battles fought since 387BC, they have won 109, lost 49 and drawn 10."" 

The first major recorded wars in the territory of modern-day France itself revolved around the Gallo-Roman conflict that predominated from 60 BC to 50 BC. The Romans eventually emerged victorious through the campaigns of Julius Caesar. After the decline of the Roman Empire, a Germanic tribe known as the Franks took control of Gaul by defeating competing tribes.

If you are going to be working abroad and paying foreign taxes, you can apply a credit for the foreign taxes paid on your US return. As the European tax rates are generally higher than the US rates, that credit alone could wipe out any tax liability you have.

O caminho que o PCP defende, se a CGP ou outra instituição for mesmo ao charco ou começar a dar prejuízo, lá vamos nós ter de pagar a incompetência deles outra vez...  E já nem sequer estou a falar dos sindicatos da CGD e os direitos adquiridos deles que vamos ter de pagar também ao longo do tempo...

Não vai ser com políticos metidos em bancos e nacionalizações que nos vamos safar com certeza... 

Já nos basta a merda que eles fazem com o dinheiro dos nossos impostos, imagina o que seria com dinheiro das poupanças também... 

Só vou deixar aqui um exemplo da bandalheira que um banco público é em que em 2004 foram buscar dinheiro da CGD para tapar o défice da altura:

Article:

&gt;Special Counsel Robert Mueller's inquiry into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election is ongoing - and secret.

&gt; Four former Trump campaign associates - Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort, Richard Gates and George Papadopoulos - have been charged, though none of the charges are directly related to any misconduct by the president's campaign.

&gt; Alex van der Zwaan, an attorney, pleaded guilty to lying to FBI investigators during the investigation, and was sentenced to 30 days in prison in April 2018.

&gt; The special counsel filed new tax evasion and bank fraud charges against Manafort and Gates in late February, potentially increasing the amount of prison time the pair could face if convicted at trial.

&gt; Here's a closer look at those who have faced charges throughout Mueller's probe.

&gt; Michael Flynn, who served as Trump's national security adviser for less than a month before resigning, was charged and pleaded guilty in December 2017 to making false statements to the FBI. Flynn reportedly lied about his talks with Russia's ambassador to Washington.

&gt; In late 2016, while former President Barack Obama was still in office, the two allegedly spoke about the U.S. sanctions imposed on Russia.

&gt; This raised concerns that Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, misled Trump officials about his conversations with Russian officials.

&gt; The special counsel filed a 32-count indictment on Feb. 22 against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and aide Rick Gates, accusing the pair of tax evasion and bank fraud.

&gt; The new indictment accuses Manafort and Gates of doctoring documents to inflate the income of their businesses and then using those fraudulent documents to obtain loans.

&gt; It also accuses Manafort of evading taxes from 2010 through 2014 and, in some of the years, concealing his foreign bank accounts.

&gt; On Feb. 23, a newly unsealed indictment accused Manafort of secretly paying former European politicians to lobby on behalf of Ukraine.

&gt; Manafort turned himself in to federal authorities in the fall.

&gt; The 68-year-old served as Trump's campaign manager for a few months in 2016.

&gt; Gates, Manafort's business associate, also turned himself in at the time.

&gt; Manafort was initially charged in a 12-count indictment in connection with foreign lobbying work, and he pleaded not guilty.

&gt; The charges included: conspiracy against the U.S., conspiracy to launder money, false statements, unregistered agent of a foreign principal, and multiple counts of failure to file reports of foreign bank and financial accounts, according to a special counsel's office spokesman.

&gt; Manafort sued to have the case against him dismissed and argued that Mueller had overstepped his bounds by charging him for conduct he says is unrelated to Russian interference in the 2016 election.

&gt; Rick Gates was named alongside Manafort in the recent charges brought by the special counsel.

&gt; He's accused of 11 counts related to filing false income tax returns and three counts of failure to report foreign bank and financial accounts.

&gt; Gates pleaded guilty on Feb. 23 to federal conspiracy and false-statements charges.

&gt; In wake of the guilty plea, Mueller moved to drop the 22 bank and tax fraud charges against him.

&gt; The decision to drop the more expansive charges against Gates could suggest that the former Trump campaign official is cooperating and providing good information to Mueller's team.

&gt; Like Manafort, Gates was initially indicted in October in connection with foreign lobbying work; he pleaded not guilty at the time.

&gt; His charges were similar to Manafort's - ranging from conspiracy against the U.S. to conspiracy to launder money.

&gt; A superseding criminal complaint says Gates was charged with conspiracy against the United States between 2006 and 2017.

&gt; A former foreign policy adviser to Trump's presidential campaign, George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty in 2017 to making false statements to the FBI regarding ""The timing, extent and nature of his relationships and interactions with certain foreign nationals whom he understood to have close connections with senior Russian government officials,"" according to court documents.

&gt; He also reportedly tried to set up meetings between Russian and Trump campaign officials on various occasions.

&gt; Mueller's team charged Dutch attorney Alex van der Zwaan for lying to federal investigators in the Russia probe in federal court on Feb. 16.

&gt; He admitted to lying about his interactions with Gates.

&gt; The charge against van der Zwaan did not involve election meddling or the Trump campaign's operations.

&gt; It stemmed from the special counsel's investigation into a covert Washington lobbying campaign Manafort and Gates are accused of directing on behalf of pro-Russian Ukrainian interests.

&gt; Richard Pinedo, a California man who sold bank accounts to Russians meddling in the election, pleaded guilty to using stolen identities to set up the bank accounts earlier this month.

&gt; The U.S. government said Pinedo did not know that he was dealing with Russians when he sold the accounts.

&gt; The plea was announced on the same day that Mueller's office charged 13 Russians and the indictment was the most direct allegation to date of illegal Russian meddling during the campaign.

&gt; Pinedo ran the online service Auction Essistance, buying and selling bank account numbers so customers could avoid security measures of digital payment companies, Newsweek reported.

&gt; A grand jury indicted 13 Russian nationals and three Russian companies in February for allegedly interfering in the 2016 election.

&gt; In the case, Mueller details a sophisticated plot to wage ""Information warfare"" on the U.S. The indictment is the first to be brought against Russian nationals in Mueller's investigation.

&gt; The Justice Department said the indictment does not allege that the interference changed the outcome of the election.

&gt; ""There is no allegation in this indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity,"" said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel probe.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/d085ecc2f7084d029eb78cc9b3b820b8.png)  

&gt; Faith No More is an alternative metal group that formed in San Francisco, California, USA in 1979. Their music combines elements of various different genres, including heavy metal, funk, hardcore punk, progressive, electronica, soul, gospel, film scores, soft rock, R&amp;B, hip hop and jazz, among many others.

&gt; Faith No More formed in 1979 under the name Sharp Young Men, and later Faith No Man. This early incarnation of the band was fronted Mike ""The Man"" Morris. Roddy Bottum, Mike Bordin, and Billy Gould decided they wanted rid of him, and rather than firing him, all three quit. They changed their name to Faith No More at the suggestion of a friend (as ""The Man"" was no more). After cycling through a few guitarists, the members recruited Jim Martin. A number of singers passed through, including a brief stint by Courtney Love. Chuck Mosley became the full time singer and appeared on their first two records. Their best known song from this era is probably ""We Care a Lot"", which satirized the prevalence of charity-related rock efforts such as Live Aid and ""We Are the World"".

&gt; The band gained a reputation for infighting and friction that sometimes went way beyond the limits of ""creative differences."" In a notorious interview in 1987, Mosley claimed that Martin had hit him with a bottle, and there were frequent rumours of physical confrontations between band members. Indeed, in a short history of the band in one issue, the British music newspaper Melody Maker observed that the band's internal relationships had descended into ""pathological hatred"". Bordin in particular seemed to be very much the ""whipping boy"" of the band and the butt of numerous cruel pranks and practical jokes. It is doubtful that the band would have stayed together had they not been successful after their second album, Introduce Yourself.

&gt; Mosley was fired in 1988, and replaced with singer Mike Patton. Patton would prove a more versatile singer than the monotone Mosley. At the time, he was singing with his high school band Mr. Bungle (and would continue to do so during his Faith No More years), and dropped out of Humboldt State University to join Faith No More. The group's first record with Patton, The Real Thing, was a major hit, selling over a million copies and earning the group a grammy.

&gt; Patton's astonishing vocal range was, arguably, the salvation of Faith No More. Although never formally trained, the young ex-student was able to veer wildly from a deep, operatic bass through to screeching banshee death metal yowls and all the way up to soulful, almost feminine drawling—usually over the space of one album (as opposed to doing it in a single song as in the band Mr. Bungle). For example, the exuberant rap on ""Epic"" and the sleazy jazz vocals of ""Edge Of the World"" (on the 1989 album The Real Thing) are wildly different. This burgeoning singing ability enabled the band to expand and develop far further. Keyboardist Bottum memorably described his new colleague as ""a pair of lungs on legs.""

&gt; The Real Thing (or TRT for short) has been described as ""not quite early Brian Eno joins Led Zeppelin and Funkadelic."" The video for ""Epic"", which featured slow motion footage of a fish flopping out of water, received extensive airplay on MTV in the summer of 1990, despite provoking anger from animal rights activists. That same year, Faith No More gave memorable performances at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards (September 6) and on Saturday Night Live (December 1).

&gt; Faith No More displayed a distinctly experimental bent on their next album, Angel Dust. One critic writes that the album is ""one of the more complex and simply confounding records ever released by a major label,"" and another writes that ""'A Small Victory', which seems to run Madame Butterfly through Metallica and Nile Rodgers … reveals a developing facility for combining unlikely elements into startlingly original concoctions.""  Angel Dust featured the singles ""Midlife Crisis"" and ""A Small Victory"", as well as a re-recording of the theme to the film Midnight Cowboy. Later pressings of the album also included their cover of the Commodores classic ""Easy"", which in some parts of the world became the band's biggest hit. Angel Dust, though not as successful as TRT in the U.S., sold 700,000 copies there, and did manage to outsell TRT in many other world charts. In Germany, for example, the record was certified Gold for sales of more than 270,000 copies. Along with heavy airplay of ""Easy"" and ""Midlife Crisis"", the album became a bit of a sleeper hit in the U.K., South America, Europe and Australia.

&gt; After touring to support Angel Dust in the summer of 1992, (including tours with Metallica and Guns N' Roses), longtime guitarist Jim Martin was fired (although he claims he quit) during the early stages of recording their follow-up, King for a Day... Fool for a Lifetime in 1995. He was replaced by Mr. Bungle guitarist Trey Spruance. However, when the subsequent world tour was about to begin, Spruance jumped ship, leaving the band to recruit their keyboard roadie Dean Menta to handle guitar duties. KFAD/FFAL remains the band's most heavily criticised album, varying in styles and moods from heavy and slow to spasmodic and jazzy. KFAD/FFAL did however sell acceptably in the U.K., Germany and Australia. In the U.S. the album failed to get any sort of attraction or following, slipping out of the charts quickly. Sales (about 1.5 million) were below that of Angel Dust. The band accordingly decided to cut their world tour short by 4 months, deleted the singles ""Gentle Art Of Making Enemies"" and ""Take This Bottle"", and released a 7 x 7-inch box set of singles that included the B-sides and some interviews between the songs. An automobile accident occurred while in Bearsville, New York for the recording of ""King For A Day."" It's been described as rather bad. Mike Patton, Mike Bordin and Trey Spruance were in it, Patton was driving. They lived...Patton doesn't drive any more. Patton comments, ""Well we saw God. We had a really bad car accident. ...We had to look at lot of things in the face...it was nice.""

&gt; 
Album of the Year was released in 1997 and featured yet another new guitarist, Jon Hudson, who was a former roommate of Billy Gould. The album debuted much higher than expected in some countries, for example Germany (#2, later going gold) and Australia (#1, going platinum). In an additional 12 countries in Europe, it went either gold or platinum. In the U.S. the reaction was slow for the album; however, just as interest was picking up on their tours and album they called it a day. Singles ""Ashes To Ashes"" and ""Last Cup Of Sorrow"" had minimal success. Electro-tinged ballad ""Stripsearch"" was released as a single in various countries (excluding the U.S. and U.K.). ""She Loves Me Not"" was cancelled as a single which was a little indicator of their imminent break-up.

&gt; On April 19th 1998, after 16 years as a band, Faith No More dissolved. Although the break-up went by with limited media attention, many rumors had surfaced as to the reason, some which included infighting, disagreement over the amount of side-projects (since the line-up had consistently changed), collective exhaustion of creative energy and even the band's growing popularity, which had been attributed as a main influence for many nu-metal bands who would ascend to the mainstream at the end of the decade. Despite being extinct for some years, the band still manages to influence and inspire musicians worldwide.

&gt; Patton went on to collaborate with John Zorn, and has been active with several other groups, including Tomahawk and Fantômas. Guitarist Jim Martin went on to collaborate with Anand Bhatt. Keyboardist Roddy Bottum formed Imperial Teen, whose sunny pop music seemed very different from Faith No More. Mike Bordin regularly performs as a member of Ozzy Osbourne's band, as well as Black Sabbath and he was also a member of Korn for a tour when their drummer David Silvera had a problem with his wrist. Billy Gould is a member of Brujeria, as well as founder of Kool Arrow Records, and has also overseen the releases of various Faith No More compilations. Jim Martin also now has the 235th largest pumpkin ever measured, and has made guest appearances on various records, including Antipop by Primus, as well as having released a solo album titled Milk and Blood (1996).

&gt; Faith No More also gained more publicity when their tracks ""Falling To Pieces"" and ""The Perfect Crime"" were featured in the films Black Hawk Down and Bill &amp; Ted's Bogus Journey respectively.

&gt; On the 25th of February 2009 Faith no More announced a reunion tour, to take place in 2009.  The band are set to play a series of European festivals, according to a press  release from frontman Mike Patton. The official press release for their reunion, written by Bill Gould, was released a day later and can be read on FNM.com. 

&gt; Th 10-song album Sol Invictus was released May 19, 2015. Read more on Last.fm.

False,Dotec,,,,"The bomb threat was ""real"" in the sense that somebody issued it and it wasn't a total fabrication. It's the credibility of the threat that was suspect. The relevant authorities looked into it and deemed it non-credible, and that Anita was free to proceed with her talk. Keep in mind that threats to speakers are likely *routine*, and if the campus shut down every talk at the receipt of one, there would never be any talks ever.

I don't expect everybody who receives a threat to just throw up their arms and go ""Oh its just words ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"" and not have any concerns. But I don't see why she wouldn't be able to accept their assessment, since it's not like there's been a historied pattern of gaming critics getting assassinated. But instead of taking the stage and going about her business as she planned to do (which was hopefully thought-out and constructive), she pulled the plug over a vacant threat, made it seem like she was under siege and a hair away from existential danger, and then ran to a media which spent the subsequent 48 hours lionizing her as a brave warrior and scolding anybody who was less impressed with her, or thought the particulars of this ""MASSIVE DEATH THREAT"" were a mite overblown (seriously, the threat itself reads like a strawman of a GGer). All sense of proportionality, or whatever was left of it, was tossed out the window at that point. And whether she intended it or not, the path she took was probably the more lucrative one.

You keep asking ""Why are bomb threats justified?"", which strikes me as a tell akin to ""Why do you think beating your wife is okay"". I don't post on 4Chan or any of the other anon boards, but I was a frequenter of r/KotakuInAction before I unsubscribed two years ago, and let me tell you: **Nobody was justifying threats against her.** If anybody did, they got thoroughly downvoted into the negatives. GGers also made a futile attempt at a ""Harassment Patrol"" on social media to identify and report bad actors that were making threats.
Now, is there widespread skepticism regarding the volume and nature of those threats? Most certainly. Anita is the type of person to throw up a Twitter wall of insults and call this ""harassment"", and even had the audacity to go the UN and bitch about mean comments on her Youtube videos. I think she has an incentive to make them more calamitous and serious than they ever actually were. And yes, I would consider her tale of ""fleeing her home"" to be an embellishment akin to ZQ's ""I fled to Europe; totally not on vacation"" lie.

But does Anita deserve the threats? No, of course not. Nobody does. And I would challenge you to find somebody within 20 yards of mainstream discourse who states otherwise, clearly and seriously.

As for giving speaking room to the unfairly maligned, I think that's admirable and generally worth pursuing. I just don't understand how you think Anita herself has been unfairly maligned? Sure, the Gators hate her. But since Gators are generally regarded as insane, misogynistic, subterranean humanoids dick-riding Milo in his Nazi fuck-bunker, who cares about their opinion?
I think you'll find that Anita Sarkeesian was treated *exceptionally* well by the gaming media, and then the mainstream media once the contamination spread. And once WaPo or NYT are selling her story their audiences, a whole lot of ""normies"" then take her side by default. All her interviews were softball, often with the interviewer not even bothering to hide his great admiration her. Serious debates were offered regularly, and she never took up any of them because that would be harassment or something. She got to go on Colbert and was an itemized heroine in Time magazine (penned by Geek Icon Whil fuckin' Wheaton of all people). Even though she is irrelevant today and not even KiA talks about her any more, that's the picture that still gets painted in the op-eds of today: Brave women fighting the hordes of toxic trolls.

So Murray and Sarkeesian both have their detractors, as most public figures do. But I didn't start seeing a protectionist blanket being dropped on Murray up until recently, whereas Sarkeesian has had one during her entire public life. Anita wouldn't have a problem finding a friendly platform to spout her noises from, whereas that seemed to be more of Charles' predicament. That makes Charles Murray the more deserving guest, by far. And if you take that away and just leave Anita to talking about feminism in general, I can only imagine it would be incredibly boring and unconvincing. She's a Pop Culture feminist, not an intellectual heavyweight.

I'm not trying to be a big dick about you just reading about her today. But it shows.

Most of their clubs operate on a loss already so they need to undermine the pinnacle of European rugby anytime it seems they might lose out in order to keep spreading the myth that the premiership is the best most competitive league accessible to English speakers in the northern hemisphere. This is why they want to strong-arm the other leagues and reduce the number of European fixtures to show that their competition take precedence. 

Mark my words, if the premiership model wins out they'll try to sink test rugby in favour of their competition as well. You can already see this in the battle form player management.

 
Perhaps, alternatively, too many of their clubs are unsustainable and the league will crash. Then the RFU may look at building a centralised system similar to the models in the Pro14 and NZ.

There is also an interesting side story about Timbuktu and people from Iberia. Many Andalusia and moriscos, from the fall of Granada onwards,  migrated to Morocco or ended there after being captured in the usual raids by berberisc pirates in the Mediterranean coasts. 

 At some point they became a political nuisance for the sultan Al-Mansur, so he decided to kill two birds with one stone and send them, besides a company if English mercenaries, with the expedition that in 159p invaded the Songhay Empire. They were led by Yuder Pasha, an Spanish morisco capture in his youth during one of the aforementioned raids and who had managed to rise on the social hierarchy thanks to his military exploits (he had fought in the Battle of Ksar-el-Kebir)  Instead of going through the sea, they crossed the Sahara and surprised the Songhay , who had to March in a hurry against the invaders. The moroccan army won a decisive victory in the Battle of Tondibi, occupying several cities in Niger River Curve, like Timbuktu an Gao.  They got so impressed by the city, that they disobeyed the orders to burn it. Many of them refused to go back to Morocco after Yuder was executed when he went back due to political intrigues, and stayed in Timbuktu and Gao. Their descendents are still there and are known as the ""Arma people"", arma meaning weapon in Spanish. Even some traditional Castilian fables were adopted by the local folklore, and Timbuktu library became a monument with works if Andalusi, Malian, Moroccan and Castilian origin together.

False,JeffB1517,,,,"OK I think reddit needs a place for this kind of conversation.  I think it needs to happen in a post 2SS framework.  A thread about what people should aim for in the next century.  

Part of the problem is that there are a lot of different factions:

* Ashkenazi old Israel who mostly support Oslo.
* New right in Israel that wants a different solution.  
* Mizrahi population that wants a more working class ethos as part of Israeli culture (something like the USA Democratic party) and is increasingly controlling Likud.
* Haredim population of Israel that is going through there own crisis.  
* American Jewish left, which supports Liberal Zionism.
* American Jewish right which supports Likud or Bennet type groups.
* Israeli Arabs 
* West Bank and Gaza Palestinians with a Fatah POV
* West Bank and Gaza Palestinians with a Hamas POV
* Diaspora Palestinians in the west
* Diaspora Palestinians in the middle east
* European and American Jews affiliated with the anti-Zionist left 
* Christians affiliated with Liberal Christian objections to Israels (WCC) 
* Evangelicals (really dispensationalists but this is how it is often phrased)
* People from European Catholic countries

Those groups come at this conflict from a very wide range of fundamentally different viewpoints.  They don't agree on basic concepts like the definition of a state or the purpose of governments which are the keys to the conflict.  

And I'm sure many others.  It is nice that many of the participants were Israeli. We didn't have enough Palestinian participants.  I think the dialogue was useful though.  There aren't many places on the internet where there was this sort of discussion without a particular lean at all.  Sure it got heated and it would take a ton of moderation to avoid heat.  That's a problem but it can be enforced. 

As an aside for a peace group I think part of the problem was that this forum wasn't using dialogue techniques.  For example one of the things that's common in dialogue is to assign participants a role other than their own beliefs.  So for example rightwing Israelis might have to argue from the perspective of diaspora Palestinians or Western anti-Zionists have to defend an evangelical perspective.  

Anyway if there is a desire to start a new group back up and we say get 5 people I'm game.   New rules and new expectations.

Southeast Europe or Southeastern Europe (SEE) is a geographical region of Europe, consisting primarily of the coterminous Balkan peninsula. There are many overlapping and conflicting definitions as to where exactly Southeastern Europe begins or ends or how it relates to other regions of the continent. Sovereign states that are most frequently included in the region are, in alphabetical order: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia, and Slovenia.

These boundaries can vary greatly due to political, economic, historical, cultural, and geographical considerations of the observer and as such are widely disputed.

But there was still a silent sensation of fear that I felt in my heart. Even though everything went as expected – Trump obviously made a statement that he should represent the Earth in the first contact with them, the East began an arming competition with Putin saying that Russia needs to be ready for the worst alongside with China and Korea. But what about Europe you say? To say the least, ‘twas a clusterfuck. Britain and France debating of whether we need to be aggressive or diplomatic during first contact, while the central Europe was going crazy with religious cults saying that we need to be ready to greet the new God. And the funny  part is, they were right.

After the first contact in march 12th, the world went wild as we learned that not only we weren’t alone, but that the entire galaxy was filled with life, sentient life. During the following weeks, the economy’s guts were screaming in German as the Euro’s value went down the toilet, America’s stocks were being sold like hotcakes, and the East went back to communism. I didn’t think it could become worse, but it did. We learned that the galaxy was being run by a mega church of gods, who were following a brutal Darwinistic logic – only the strongest survive. These gods would partake in duels, gathering their strength from their believers, and whoever was the stronger would win – the winner would climb higher in the rankings of this hierarchy, while the loser would see his civilization burned to ashes. My heart sunk to the ground when the news came. With the world split into thousand different religions and beliefs, not to mention atheism being amongst the most popular ones, we stood no chance. But there was still a glimmer of hope, as the duel wasn’t a typical standoff like we thought – it was a rap battle, conveniently in English, who would have guessed that it was an intergalactic language? 

The long awaited day finally came – it was April the third when we received a threat from an alien civilization who called themselves Gorions, which stated that they wanted to duel. After a shit show of a debate, we decided that Eminem would be the one who would have to fight against their god, Thoreses. Eminem who was in a rehabilitation period after his latest album flop was very hesitant about partaking in the duel, but after much hesitation he decided to do it, since it meant that he could take a last shot at showing he was better than lil Pump. The fight was broadcasted worldwide – everyone was listening, since our lives depended on the outcome of the duel. Hilariously, to all of our surprise, Thoreses lost. Horribly, and her southern Irish accent didn’t help her one bit and humanity lived to see another day. For some time.

deep down the liberal knows that refugees bring rape and crime, but it selfishly clears the of shame they feel they've inherited from their forefathers because they are helping people in their mind while conservatives they consider to be modern day Nazi slave owners. the muslms know this and use them in return, making words like islamophobia the left can use to defend the right. and when its all done and finished the Muslims kill the liberal too and take over. the liberals wake up to this fact only when theyve repeatedly experienced the same behavior from the people they are trying to help and when they feel the community is no loner safe enough for them to live there, they move and tell everybody how racist they are in their new safe and single cultured communities and start it all over again.

For me, I am not terribly interested in the temples. I know this is probably bad to say, but I feel like after seeing two or three then I will feel set. Same with how I saw European castles. Sure they were cool, but I would rather be going on a hike or doing some urban exploration.

As far as what we are looking to do in Tokyo goes, there really is no limit. Im a bit of a foodie and I am looking forward to trying the local cuisine but I am not sure where to start. I know there are ramen places all over. Im sure they are all pretty good. 

Outside of ramen though, I am not sure what else needs to be tried. Suggestions on food, at least what type, and even where, would be greatly appreciated by this traveler. 

I am also really into film, animation, music, and video games. Im not sure where to go for this sort of flavor. Kurosawa might be my favorite director so I would enjoy anything that has to do with him. It would also be cool to check out some live music at night and check out the bar scene. I believe the bars are called Izakayas and they are similar to pubs? Not really looking to go to the club or anything. 

Shopping is another thing that will happen while we are there. I would like to go to the Puma store and whatever else is available. My wife really wants to go to Harajuku to shop so I am sure that will be fun to check out. Im not crazy about shopping but im sure there is a lot of cool stuff to look at.

I do really LOVE nature so I am really looking forward to Nikko. Right now I am not totally hyped on Kyoto, but every person I have talked to said it is one place that should not be skipped.

&gt;**Ministro da Fazenda trocou o PSD pelo MDB mirando pré-candidatura à Presidência da República. Ele deve deixar o ministério até o fim da semana para concorrer nas eleições de outubro.**  


&gt; Questionado durante o evento se será o candidato do MDB à Presidência da República, Meirelles afirmou que isso não é objeto de discussão neste momento. Meirelles assinou a ficha, que logo depois foi abonada por Temer, pelo senador Romero Jucá (RR), presidente da legenda, e pelo deputado Baleia Rossi (SP). Ao abrir o ato de filiação, Romero Jucá afirmou que o ingresso de Meirelles no partido representa uma reafirmação de preceitos de transformação do país e, também, uma nova forma de conduzir a economia. Meirelles, mais o comando político do governo, conseguiu, no meio de tormentas, ataques, especulações, ter experiência para que a nau Brasil, nosso país, fosse conduzido da melhor forma possível"", declarou ele. Jucá disse também que Henrique Meirelles se coloca à disposição do partido para somar esforços e ""ganhar uma eleição"" que vai conduzir uma transição política e econômica do país. O presidente Michel Temer destacou, ainda, que o MDB trabalha na ponte para o futuro 2, a fim de manter as reformas promovidas por seu governo. Ministro da Fazenda no governo de Michel Temer, o goiano Henrique Meirelles comandou o Banco Central nos dois mandatos do ex-presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, entre 2003 e 2010.

False,blackjack_oak,,,,"I'm not sure what you mean, really. Everyone before colonization had poor sanitation and ethnic disputes. West Africa had iron working, intensive agriculture, cattle herding, etc. by the time the Portuguese got to them. The major technology gap was in ship-building and guns, which were the innovations that really counted at the time.

Anyway, the situation which has led to the modern train wreck that is the DRC *does* have a lot to do with past colonialism.

The DRC was created as ""The Belgian Congo"", which was by far the worst African colony you could have been in.

*""Leopold amassed a huge personal fortune by exploiting the natural resources of the Congo. At first, ivory was exported, but this did not yield the expected levels of revenue. When the global demand for rubber exploded, attention shifted to the labor-intensive collection of sap from rubber plants. Abandoning the promises of the Berlin Conference in the late 1890s, the Free State government restricted foreign access and extorted forced labor from the natives. Abuses, especially in the rubber industry, included forced labor of the native population, beatings, widespread killings, and* **frequent mutilation when production quotas were not met**. *Estimates of the death toll range from one million to fifteen million.""* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_II_of_Belgium

So then you eventually abandon the country, peacefully. But since you basically just used all the local people as slaves, none of them learned any trades that could support an independent economy. Poverty leads the average ambitious man to war, and this forces other men to go to war in order to not be destroyed. Furthermore, the lines of the ""nation"" were only drawn based on *what other European powers didn't already control*, so it's a random hob-gobble of different ethnic groups who don't trust each other or have any relationship.",True,False,1,1522779923,,1522780257,0,dwqtewg,False,t3_89c0c1,True,t1_dwqjwd2,/r/news/comments/89c0c1/the_wars_will_never_stop_millions_flee_bloodshed/dwqtewg/,,1525919016,4,False,True,False,news,t5_2qh3l,public,

Article:

&gt;2:10 p.m. President Donald Trump says the U.S. remains a steadfast ally to the three Baltic nations and is pointing to his push for NATO members to increase their defense spending.

&gt; Trump is joining the presidents of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania at the White House for a joint news conference.

&gt; He says the Baltics ""Can trust the United States will remain a strong, proud and loyal friend and ally.""

&gt; Trump is praising the three NATO members for boosting their defense spending and says their ""Commitment to burden sharing"" is an example for other nations to follow.

&gt; The Baltic leaders are pointing to their security commitments.

&gt; Lithuania's Dalia Grybauskaite says the Article 5 collective defense under NATO is ""Iron-clad for all of us.""

&gt; Estonia's Kersti Kaljulaid says the countries are ""An axis of good.""

&gt; 12:35 p.m. President Donald Trump is telling the leaders of the three Baltic countries that no one has been tougher on Russia and says he's been pressing NATO members to increase their defense spending.

&gt; Trump is telling the presidents of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania that ""Getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing."" Asked by a reporter if Vladimir Putin is a friend or a foe, Trump says, ""We'll find out. I'll let you know.""

&gt; The president is pointing to his push for NATO members to boost their defense spending.

&gt; The meeting comes as the White House has raised the possibility of Trump welcoming Putin to the White House.

&gt; The Baltic states are seen as a bulwark against Russian aggression in Eastern Europe.

&gt; 12 p.m. The leaders of the Baltic countries have arrived at the White House for talks with President Donald Trump.

&gt; Trump's meeting Tuesday with the presidents of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania comes a day after the White House dangled the prospect of extending a similar welcome to Russia's Vladimir Putin.

&gt; Britain recently blamed Russia for the nerve-agent poisoning of a former Russian spy on British soil.

&gt; Trump joined Britain in expelling scores of Russian diplomats in response.

&gt; The leaders are expected to discuss security, business, trade and energy issues during a visit that also highlights 100 years of Baltic independence.

&gt; Trump and the three presidents are scheduled to answer journalists' questions at a news conference after the talks.

False,nemoknows,newjersey-flag,,New Jersey,"You talk about belief, but you’ve offered zero evidence of oppression of whites by other races. How about you put up or shut up?

I can’t think of a single state since European colonialism began where whites got the short end of the stick. The most I can think of are colonial regimes getting expelled by force, and antipathy towards the allies and kids they left behind. And that didn’t even happen in many cases where colonialism ended. It didn’t even happen in South Africa. Imperial Japan went to war with the allies and took a lot of western colonies, but never even threatened to invade  any western state - they were in fact attempting western-style colonialism. 

For that matter, I can’t think of any case, basically ever, where women systematically oppressed men of the same race and class. It’s always somewhere between misogyny and equality. 

On the other hand, there are innumerable cases where whites, men, and especially white men have created institutions that oppressed other groups in ways ranging from self-serving to outright evil. Sometimes for centuries. 

The most white men can complain about is a bit of affirmative action and welfare designed to lessen the legacy of centuries of *de juro* and *de facto* oppression.

False,mradtke66,,,,"The best ""bench wood"" has three properties:  

1. Cheap
2. Readily available
3. stiff

In the US, that means construction lumber, but hardwoods are obviously okay too!

It's kind of funny, bench builders in the US would over-pay for beech because ""that's what they use in Europe!""  and Beech is pretty pricey over here.  So then they switched to using maple, as maple as a wood is pretty similar to beech.

So, what would should you use?  If you're at all on a budget, buy construction lumber.  The key it to buy the longest, widest stuff you can, as it tends to be the best wood.  In the US, that tends to be stuff intended for floor joists, 2x12s (actual dimensions of 1.5"" x 11.25"").  That bigger wood came from older trees and tends to be straighter.

Longer also helps, so a 16 or 20 foot long 2x12 would come from a pretty nice tree.

The the wood in thirds and face glue them together.  That would give you a nice slab of a top.  

ALTERNATIVE: Buy 2x6 stock and just face glue the boards.  You'll have a lot of planing to do, but if you don't have a table saw or it's a little too small, this trick works.

If you have access to actual timbers, say a 6x6, you're in good shape.  

Regarding the specific ""redwood pine,"" it's probably okay.  Is there another species that you can compare its hardness to?

Generally, you get away with pretty soft stuff.  But soft tends to be light and will take a lot of abuse.

False,tensor4566,,,,"&gt; In Norway, health care is second to none. No wait times (travel can be an issue though). Education is covered much better than Canada.

Agreed by Norway also isn't single payer. Single payer systems like ours always tend to suffer from poor wait times. Pretty much all the European health care models tend to destroy us on wait time.

* Edit: https://nordic.businessinsider.com/the-16-countries-with-the-worlds-best-healthcare-systems-2017-1/

*  Also, apparently its second to quite a few.

&gt; I'm sorry, did you just compare China to Norway?

Seriously did you not even read my next sentance? ""Norway isn't like China but the point is that you can't say people are essentially millionaires just because you take the money of the country and divide by the number of citizens.""

&gt; How very American.

It's American to want to keep the money I earned? Well call me Uncle Sam then, I guess.

&gt; Ummmm, ...I'm going to go with ""Quality of life"" over ""cost of living"" here as Quality of Life covers so much more than what's in your wallet (though that's included too, IIRC) and still includes education costs for your kids, health care, etc., etc.

https://www.numbeo.com/quality-of-life/rankings_by_country.jsp

This is Canada vs Norway which puts us a little lower (12 vs 16) but this is all of Canada.

However when we look at this:

https://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/articles/heres-where-your-province-ranks-based-on-quality-of-life/70623

Now this is from 2016 but we can say that Alberta ranks Highest in Canada from Quality of life and would rank 4th in the world when compared to international standards if it was judged independently

So they seem to be doing great in terms of Quality of Life AND get to have some extra money to spend on the things they want.

False,Kzickas,,,2∆,"&gt; Note that this predates the boundaries of nearly all the countries in the Middle East or Africa, so any schema which claims that Israel is illegitimate also throws into question the territorial integrity of states representing nearly 2 billion people.

Yes. I have nothing against doing so if someone makes a case that the status quo is injust to them. I supported the independence of South Sudan from Sudan for exemple.

&gt; The avowed aim of Arab League was the destruction of Israel, whereas the aim of Israel was self-defense. Israel won the war so totally that it could have chosen to eliminate the state of Palestine by pushing the entirety of its population into adjacent countries, but it chose not to. 

No. The aim of Israel was to take the land from its Palestinian population. And Israel did indeed, push out the overwhelming majority of the Palestinian population from the areas it seized control of during the war.

&gt; The UN resolution on refugees too, is notable: ""refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbours should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date, and that compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing not to return and for loss of or damage to property which, under principles of international law or equity, should be made good by the Governments or authorities responsible"" &lt;&lt;life at peace with their neighbours&gt;&gt; is the significant line here.

It really isn't. Israel won't allow any Palestinians who wish to live at peace with their neighbors to return. Israel has made it clear that it has no intent of ever letting any refugees return under any circumstances, regardless of their or any other Palestinians' peacefulness. It has also made it very clear that the reason for that refusal is grounded in maintaining a Jewish state.

&gt; Israel has not recognized a right of return because the consistent position of the Palestinian people (presently in the case of Hamas and until recently, in the case of Fatah) has been that Israel should be destroyed

Israel defines itself through racial politics. Israel considers allowing its Palestinian population to return to *be* destruction. To say that has not reckognized the right to return because the Palestinians want the destruction of Israel is equivalent to saying that Israel will not allow the Palestinians to return because the Palestinians want to return. And Fatah in particular has over close to twenty years repeatedly offered peace if the refugees are allowed to return and the West Bank made independent. Israel's answer has always been that it will never discuss allowing the refugees to return.

&gt; Re: apartheid.

I absolutely agree that occupying the West Bank does not make Israel an apartheid state. Occupying the West Bank makes no difference to wether Israel is apartheid, but I'd say that's because Israel would still be an aprtheid state if it withdrew from the West Bank.

As for the similarities and differences: Once apartheid was fully implemented (Black States Citizenship Act) there were no black citizens in South Africa. There were still black people living in South Africa, but they did not have citizenship. And I do agree that there's a difference there, Israel is thurough in not letting the part of its Palestinian population that are denied citizenship live in the country. This is different from South Africa, but I don't think it's a difference that takes away from calling Israel apartheid: South Africa worked towards making the black population live in the Bantustans physically as well as legally, but that didn't please the opponents of apartheid at all. The opponents of apartheid wanted the black population to be both free to live in South Africa and have South African citizenship. Since the difference here is in the exact opposite direction of the change that anti-apartheid activists wanted in South Africa it doesn't make sense to use it as a defence against the comparison.

It is also true that Israel allows a minority of its Palestinian population citizenship, while physically and legally excluding the majority, and that South Africa allowed no black citizens at all. I can absolutely see why that would make a big difference to some people, but to me it doesn't. I think what matters is how each individual is treated. Israel treats millions of Palestinians in an apartheid like way, so I feel entirely justified in calling it apartheid. I don't think it matters that there are others that it doesn't treat in that way.

&gt; More broadly, the UN resolution provides context but not justification for Israel's existence. Israel has a moral right to exist because it emerged from a war with people who wanted to destroy it and did not retaliate equivalently.

This argument doesn't work. Saying that it was defending itself is saying that Israel already existed before the war, which rests on the authority of the United Nations to give the land to the Jews. I would say that Israel exists because a group of European Jews who felt ethnically more entiteld to the land than the existing Palestinian population won a war against the Palestinians who tried to stop them. The primary difference between these narratives is the authority granted to the UN.",True,False,0,1522784148,,False,0,dwqyx9e,False,t3_896y6p,True,t1_dwqtrk6,/r/changemyview/comments/896y6p/cmv_antisemitism_does_not_include_being_opposed/dwqyx9e/,,1525921805,2,False,True,False,changemyview,t5_2w2s8,public,

False,felipeftz,,,,"Tem TL;dr; no fim.

Eu sou péssimo em lembrar detalhes de filmes,  mas vou fazer um resumo listando alguns partes do filme e como é retratado:
- No inicio no filme é mostrado o Edir como jovem e iniciando a vida religiosa na igreja católica (e o preconceito que ele sofre por estar se tornando ""esses crentes fanáticos""). Destaco aqui uma parte que mostra a fé curando a doença da irmã dele, que quando tava mal de asma, ela escutava missa pelo rádio e melhorava. 

- Há uma transação de tempo e mostra o Edir em idade adulta, ainda na igreja católica onde conhece a mulher dele (Ester). Nesta parte mostra a frustração dele com a igreja  como por exemplo quando um mendigo é expulso da igreja por que ""não é local pra esse tipo de pessoa"",  ou quando o responsável pela igreja é contrário a ideia do Edir se tornar uma espécie de missionário (basicamente negando a ajuda dele para buscar as almas perdidas). 

- Depois de ser negado da igreja católica, o Edir se junta com o cunhado, o R. R. Soares (que já era bispo), onde eles começam a trabalhar em uma nova igreja. O Edir nessa igreja apenas ajuda a trabalhar com a parte financeira da igreja e faz pequenos cultos quando tem poucas pessoas na missa. Quando ele expressa que quer se dedicar inteiramente a cultos (largar o emprego e se tornar full time pregador) o R. R. Soares e um outro bispo dessa igreja nova, nega a ideia e meio que humilha ele.

- Dai o Edir ouve o chamado de Deus (é uma parte que ele começa a se rir sozinho) e ele decide por ir atrás das almas perdidas. Mostra ele pegando um alto falante, indo pra praça e fazendo discursos motivacionais (tipo missa) pras pessoas que passam e logo começa a juntar multidão. Mostra ele expulsando o demônio do corpo de uma mulher (ala Exorcista). Mostra ele abrindo a primeira igreja dele, eles começando a juntar mais fiéis, fazendo missa por rádio, melhorando a igreja, começando a juntar ainda mais multidões e etc.

- A partir dai surge três figuras: um advogado/juiz, um ministro e um padre católico de alto escalão. Os três conspiram contra o Edir por que ele tá chamando muita atenção, por ele ser charlatão e etc. Mostra eles em reuniões conversando sobre como eles podem acabar com o Edir, quais falsas provas eles poderiam levantar contra ele e coisas assim.

- Durante estas últimas partes mostra mais detalhes da vida pessoal do Edir (casamento, vivendo em apartamento fudido, se mudando pra casa dos sogros, tendo o primeiro filho, a mulher tendo que trabalhar fora de casa, o nascimento da segunda filha com deficiência física no lábio superior e outras coisas assim).

- Mais pro fim do filme ele é indiciado, é preso, passa dias na cadeia, mostra o julgamento dele, como os fiéis se comportaram, como os outros presidiários respeitavam ele, toda essa ladainha assim.

tl;dr; 
O filme trata o Edir como o santo do holy graal, o cara mais humilde do mundo, que tem defeitos, mas que as qualidades superam qualquer falha de caráter. Mostrando como o governo, a Globo, a igreja católica e qualquer um que não gosta de religião é um vilão da história e que quer acabar com o trabalho do bem do bispo.
Em outras palavras o filme pinta o Edir como o moçinho, e mostra todos os acusadores dele, como conspiradores de uma grande trama pra derrubar ele.",True,False,0,1522784790,,False,0,dwqzrhp,False,t3_88ywkw,True,t1_dwqxhc3,/r/brasil/comments/88ywkw/edir_macedo_pressiona_governo_para_ser/dwqzrhp/,,1525922224,2,False,True,False,brasil,t5_2qh9i,public,

&gt; Corbyn's detractors point to his association with Paul Eisen, a Holocaust denier, his defense of Reverend Stephen Sizer, who shared materials online linking Jews to the 9/11 attack, and welcoming visitor Sheikh Raed Salah to Parliament, who has allegedly used the blood libel -- the false accusation that Jews have murdered Christian children to use their blood in rituals.

&gt; More recently, it was also revealed that Corbyn was a member of two Facebook groups, ""Palestine Live"" and ""History of Palestine"" in which anti-Semitic commentary and imagery was prevalent. Corbyn said he was added to the groups by other people and removed himself after their content was brought to his attention

&gt; Corbyn's allies have also drawn fire. Former Mayor of London Ken Livingstone was suspended after claiming Hitler was a Zionist. Another Labour lawmaker, Naz Shah, was also suspended over remarks she made over Israel on Facebook.


&gt; But the defining moment came last week, when a Labour MP demanded to know why Corbyn had offered his support in 2012 to a graffiti artist whose mural featured several anti-Semitic tropes.

There is an interesting thing called [Hofsteads cultural dimensions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstede%27s_cultural_dimensions_theory) the US ranks very high on individuality which is why people with an American background find this ‘curtailing’ of speech abhorrent.

However in the UK these laws are different, they have broad freedom of speech with caveats.  For example speech that causes anxiety is limited, anything that causes racial hatred is as well all forms of speech promoting terrorism are also banned. Certain forms of speech against the government are also banned such as calling for the absolution of the Monarchy. Anything classified as ‘scandalized’ the court is banned. Anything against public morals and decency are also offenses. They also censor the Internet to some degree, like France and the US terrorism has spawned increasing surveillance. 

Another place this could be illegal is in Germany, usages of hate speech, nazi symbols and holocaust denial are all punishable offenses. 

I haven’t dug through rest of EU but my point is most other places don’t see it the same way the US does.

False,vag10,eu,,,"I definitely agree with you that in order to have an actual conversation they must have someone against franchising to discuss his point of view. This was forced and it was just made in order to convince more fans to be pro franchising.

To add more, a lot of times in this podcast, there were many contradictions, from both the owners and the rioter.

For example, they say that the ""stability"" that the franchising will have, it will increase competitiveness, but on the other hand they moved back to B01 when it is proven that B03 is better. If we had B03, MSF would be in playoffs and had a chance to win lcs.

And why should they be guaranteed this stability? Isnt G2 and MSF extremely stable right now even with the current system? Was there a chance that they would get relegated? No. And they are safe because they had the skills to build their orgs and made it this way.

In the end of the day, you make an investment, a ""bet"". Why should someone guarantee you that you will win this bet? Ocelote at one point said something about ""100% certainty"". Nothing is 100% certain ever. If you dont deserve your spot, you should lose it and someone better should take it. And you should try to earn it again and not disband your team.

Also, they said they cant fix the existing problems in the challenger series. That only sound like a joke to me.

Currently competing for the European Master we have 10 National/Regional leagues with average 8 teams each (and we are still missing some regions). 400+ players. And you tell me you cant work with that? And instead you prefer to turn all these into talent farming for the 10 franchised teams?

The only thing i agree with in the relegations segment is that 3 months (which it is not 3 months anymore and it is one team once a year) are not enough because of too few matches. And thats why last year they made relegations once a year, but the owners apparently didnt even like that and pushed to remove it completely.

False,Anurse1701,SciNoncom,,Chief Petty Officer,"I didn't recall that occurring when I wrote my OP, but you are correct. What your describing are essentially more technological bank notes. Back before fiat money, dollars used to be able to be cashed in for a specific amount of gold at the bank which printed the note. But still the money is tied to a commodity, which carries with certain dangers. 

And yes people will speculate with other currency, commodities, and assets just like in modern economies today. I don't agree that these markets would prevent the devaluation of bank notes backed by latinum. The reliance on latinum, which may have been less rare than the Ferengi thought, could have doomed them to destitution as their main currency backing became worthless and they could do nothing to stop it.

My thesis is loosely based around the gold influx from the Americas to Europe, but in a much more rapid period.

False,[deleted],,,,"&gt; subsequent gangster behavior of Israelis and Jews being really, really fucked up and offensive to basic morality

Europe feels the same way about Trump. if you really believed this, you'd be just as critical of Americans

&gt; correlation pretty strongly hints at causation

there's nothing wrong with pattern-recognition, but jumping to massive conclusions based on limited evidence is just dumb. I'm not really talking about 'basic truths' but rather the tendency of the altright to jump to wild conclusions based on a piece of news they read that fits their narrative. ""Israel is sending us the refugees? They'e trying to destroy us like Barbara Spectre!"" boom, that quick, without even a cursory glance at whether there's more to the story.

it's intellectually vapid. it's the same as a SJW who reads a story about Trayvon Martin and immediately jumps to conclusions about white privilege

&gt; Making all these nuanced arguments about intent

the question isn't about intent, and I never even said that. re-read what I said. the question is about what actually happened. for example, if the reason that these refugees are being sent to the West is because the EU prevented them from being sent back to Africa, it adds nuance to the story. you seem to think I'm trying to 'explain this away.' I'm not. If I actually felt we were fully complicit, I would take responsibility. rather, I'm pointing out this nuance for the same reason that a White person pointed out nuance when Trayvon Martin's death was blamed on a 'white' guy. 

any intellectually honest movement that wasn't based simply on scapegoating would criticize both Western Jews and European Whites for forcing africans on the West. but the truth, at the end of the day, is that you personally don't believe that European whites have any real complicity. you believe everything European Whites do wrong is cause (((we're))) taking advantage of their 'pathological altruism.'

the altright = 'we dindu nuffin.' Ironically, I bet there's a BLM person out there who acts just like you. ""Whites can never take any blame! they enrage me!'

False,Meistermalkav,,,,"Let's face it: America and Israel were the centerpiece of the middle eastern conflicts. All of them. Not that much goodwill left. Syria has accepted that pretty quickly, and has invited the russians. The only people who are able to lay down a carpet bombardment on isis strongholds, and go, what strongholds? What carpet bombardment? And the americans would be about the only ones that would start world war 3 in israel. and because most people (except the american evangelicals) don't want this, you have this shit. 

Personally? I would love it if palestine just went communist. to please russia. And then  russia decided, of course, israel has a right to exist, and officially, we are not attacking israel, we are just air dropping crates and crates of old soviet surplus into palestine, including instructions in palestinian, how to operate this. To arm the rebels that want democratic change. because we are bound to want an israeli government which ends the occupation of palestine immediatelly, because that just fits with our strategy. and if israel insists on building new settlements against UN wishes, russia just holds a referendum which settlements wanna join syria. 

you know, the american strategy, just from the other side. would be refreshing to see this employed on behalf of the middle eastern people. 

Of course, if we believe the propaganda of bibi, the second any european country would not immediatelly help the israeli state from being destroyed, they would launch their nukes, to ""take the world (read europe) with them"". 

Since this is not negotionable (the ""official"" israeli position, not mine. I would negotiate the fuck out of this before even one nuke goes off, but that's just me), I would say, europe points every single nuke, bomb, bioloigical warfare canister and space station currently in descent , when world war 3 starts, towards Israel. When only one nuke towards europe goes up, turn the entire region into a glass crater, and finished. Peace in the middle east. Send flowers and gift baskets to the surrounding people, and help them with the rebuilding. Just turn the promised land absolutely decimated. Don't answer proportionally, if the israelis send up 1 nuke, send down 24. Centered on the wailing wall, and every jewish holy site in israel and the surrounding area. Spelling mene mene tekel upharsin in nuclear bomb craters would have a certain symetry. 

The jewish people got their land based on the idea that they were better, and not as scummy as the rest, if we believe their portion of the thora.

False,GeorgePapadopoulos,,,,"&gt;you might be overestimating Russia's actual military capabilities there

And you are overestimating NATOs. It's not the 1980s anymore and most countries have at best a couple hundred MBTs, a handful of subs, and a hundred of so fighter planes. That's even if they're operational.

&gt;knowing you need at least 3:1 ratio to win against a defending enemy

Urban legend disproved by the US already in Iraq and Russia in Georgia.

&gt;Russia is a shadow of its former Soviet glory

In many regards it isn't. Yes, quantity has greatly diminished, but so too have antiquated systems that would have faired poorly against the NATO aircraft of the time. At the same time the European countries of NATO have become a small shadow of themselves with weapon systems that (with few exceptions) have not tracked the progress made by the US or Russia. 

For example, you do realize that from the coast of France and until the Russian border (meaning France, BENELUX, Germany, Poland) 
there are less than a thousand tanks and 600 fighter aircraft (if in fact operational)? How well do you think the Tornado, Mirage 2000, and F-16 will fare (even in a 1v1) against the Russian air force? Heck, throw in the Eurofighter and Rafale as well. Notice that on both quality and quantity there is a deficiency in Europe.

In my state you have to register an air soft gun, pellet gun, or BB gun like it's an actual weapon, and if you get caught with an unregistered aforementioned, it carries the same weight as if you were carrying an actual unregistered firearm.

I don't own a gun, but I've gone to ranges plenty of times and I can agree/confirm that guns are fucking cool.

But as an inbetween party, someone who doesn't own a firearm and someone who doesn't think they're the root of all evil, I do believe we need a change at the federal level.

People can still have their guns, but they need to be trained and licensed in how to operate them- just like a car. Being of a certain age isn't a strong enough requirement and parents teaching their children isn't a regulated practice.

In conjunction with that testing and licensing process, they need to:

1) Pass practical yet extensive background checks.

2) they need to pass a practical yet thorough psych evaluation.

3) They need to own and provide proof of purchase of a gun safe and/or show the environment in which they will be storing the gun- not unlike how employers survery your home for ""work from home"" permissions to insure you have a dedicated and practical work environment.

I read elsewhere in the thread a pretty convincing comment about his only grievance with the club being money. If that's true, and he does believe in the direction of the club, he should definitely wait it out and leave next year on the £25m clause. That would give him another year to play in the new stadium and champions league (knock on wood) for Spurs one last time.

Additionally, the release clause option has some other advantages.
Midpoint in net earnings, he can play for his spot in the WC, and he can choose his destination from what is likely to be every top club in Europe. I'm sure Poch wouldn't begrudge the man the opportunity to play his final years for PSG, or Barca or Real. I mean, hell, Poch did that himself!

About 30,000 immigrants came to Israel prior to 2012 in just a few years. Israel has since built a border fence and organized recon battalions to actively monitor the border. The number quickly dropped from thousands to something you can count on both hands.

The immigrants were all bunched up in a detention facility called Holot, in the Negev Desert, until the government could decide what to do with them. The expiration date for that facility has passed, and now it's closed and the people are pending a government decision.

Netanyahu first planned on deporting them all to African countries such as Uganda and Angola. Then the UN criticized him and his plan, chief among the Canada. So in return he told the UN to come up with a plan, and that Canada also take some of these refugees then. Now what's known is that Germany, Italy, and Canada will take roughly 18,000, while Israel accepts 16,000.

Those who stay in Israel are people who cannot be separated from each other or cannot do on their own, i.e families, elderly people, children etc. Young single people who can work will be sent to Europe and Canada, where they won't be a liability but some cheap labor.

But the people of southern Tel Aviv, who had already taken in plenty of refugees from places like Eritrea and Sudan, and who put up with high crime rates and underdevelopment of their part of the city, have protested to Netanyahu as they'll take the brunt on this one. So it seems this new plan will be cancelled as well, with many alternatives circling around like temporarily re-opening the detention facility and re-examining the options with the UN.

Many of these people were escaping from human traffickers (slavery, prostitution), terrorists etc, so returning to Africa would be a life threatening scenario for them, even for the countries mentioned (although there is doubt about it, as these countries are considered safe), and Egypt wasn't very welcoming for them while they passed through the Sinai, as many told of shootings against them.
Keeping them is not an option either though, as Israel cannot take in that many refugees. We'll see what we can do. In the mean time, it should be clear we're not trying to screw anyone over.

Do they believe that they encountered ancient ""natives"" that had been there since the stone ages? do they believe that the germans and natives came together to become the nordic tribes like the Gaets, Jutes, etc? Ive also heard that they have reason to believe that in the stone ages the sea level was much lower and much of the north sea between britain and denmark was inhabited by people. I believe they have even discovered artifacts on the ocean floor. Germanic oral history is possibly the most interesting part of ancient european culture. There are stories written down by a danish scribe after the end of the viking age that had been passed down from the swedish gothic kingdoms from almost a thousand years before. one of which involved a battle between the goths and the huns in the 4th century. That they remained intact in oral tradition is pretty incredible.

&gt; Return to Forever was the name of a jazz fusion band founded and led by keyboardist Chick Corea. The band cycled through many members, but the only consistent band mate of Corea's was bassist Stanley Clarke. Along with Weather Report and Mahavishnu Orchestra, these bands are often seen as the core of jazz fusion music in the 1970s. Several musicians, including Clarke, Flora Purim, Airto Moreira and Al Di Meola first became well-known through their performances on Return to Forever's albums.

&gt; After playing on Miles Davis' albums In a Silent Way and Bitches Brew, Corea formed an avant-garde jazz band called Circle with Dave Holland, Anthony Braxton and Barry Altschul. However in 1972, after becoming a disciple of  Scientology, Corea decided that he wanted to ""communicate"" with the audience. This essentially meant that he wanted to make more commercial music, since avant-garde jazz had a relatively small audience.

&gt; The first line-up (1972 - 1973)

&gt; The first Return to Forever band played latin-oriented music. The initial band consisted of singer (and occasional percussionist) Flora Purim, her husband Airto Moreira on drums and other percussion, Corea's longtime musical co-worker Joe Farrell on saxophone and flute, and the young bassist Stanley Clarke, who became the only constant member of the band apart from Corea. Especially in this first line-up, Clarke played double bass in addition to electric bass. Corea's electric piano was the leading instrument in this group's sound, but Clarke and Farrell were also given plenty of solo space. Purim's vocal gave some commercial appeal for their music, but many compositions were instrumental and more or less experimental in their nature. The music was composed by Corea with the exception of the title track of the second album which was written by Stanley Clarke. Lyrics were often written by Corea's friend Neville Porter, and were often related to scientology, though this is not necessarily easy to recognize for outsiders. Clarke was involved in Scientology through Corea, but left the cult in the early 1980s.

&gt; The first album, named simply Return to Forever, was cut for ECM Records in 1972 and was initially released only in Europe. This album featured Corea's famous compositions Crystal Silence and La Fiesta. Shortly afterwards, Corea, Airto, Clarke and Tony Williams formed the band for Stan Getz's album Captain Marvel (1972), which featured Corea's compositions including some from the first and second Return to Forever albums. The second album, Light as a Feather (1973), was released by Polydor and included the famous song, Spain.

&gt; The jazz-rock era (1973 - 1976)

&gt; After the second album, Purim and Moreira left the group in order to set up their own band. Farrell also left, and guitarist Bill Connors, drummer Steve Gadd and percussionist Mingo Lewis were taken on. However, Gadd was not willing to go touring and leave his job as a hard working studio drummer. Lenny White (who had played with Corea in Miles Davis's band) replaced Gadd and Lewis, and the group's third album, Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy (1973), was rerecorded. The first recording featuring Gadd was never released and is said to be missing.

&gt; The nature of the group's music had now completely changed to ""jazz-rock"", similar to what The Mahavishnu Orchestra and some progressive rock bands were doing at the same time. The music was still relatively melodic, relying on strong themes, but traditional jazz feel was almost completely gone. Distorted guitar had become prominent in the band's new sound, and Clarke played mostly electric bass. A new singer had not been hired, and all the songs were now instrumentals. This however, did not lead to a decrease in band's commercial potential - Return to Forever's jazz-rock albums always found their way to US pop album charts.

&gt; The second jazz-rock album, Where Have I Known You Before, (1974) was similar in style to the previous album, but Corea played synthesizers in addition to electric piano, and Clarke had developed his famous electric bass sound and style. Since Bill Connors had wanted to concentrate on his solo career, the group had also hired a new guitarist. Earl Klugh played guitar on some group's live performances but he was soon replaced by the 19 year old guitar wizard Al Di Meola, who played guitar on the album.

&gt; The next album, No Mystery (1975), was made with the same line-up as its predecessor, but the style of music was more varied. The first side of the record consisted mostly of jazz-funk, while the second side featured Corea's acoustic title track and a long composition that borrowed partly from Spanish music. On this and the following album, each member of the group composed at least one of the tracks. No Mystery won the Grammy Award for Best Jazz Performance by a Group.

&gt; The last album by the most long-lasting lineup of Return to Forever was Romantic Warrior (1976). By this time the group had left Polydor for Columbia Records. The album became the best selling of all Return to Forever albums, eventually reaching gold disc status. This album continued experiments in the realm of jazz-rock and related genres, and is also famous for its technically demanding playing.

&gt; The last album (1977)

&gt; The final version of Return to Forever featured a four piece horn section and Corea's wife Gayle singing vocals, and recorded just one studio album, Musicmagic (1977). The music had returned closer to the gentle feel of the music of the first line-up. However, instead of strong Latin influences, the last album features bombastic arrangements for horn section and synthesizers. Compositions remained relatively complex.

&gt; In 1983 the White/Di Meola line up returned briefly on the stage, but did not record a new album, only one track issued on Corea's Touchstone album entitled ""Compadres"".

&gt; Again in 2008, the classic lineup of Corea, Di Meola, Clarke, and White reunited for a reunion tour of the United States. The band's official Web site announced after the tour's completion that a concert DVD was forthcoming. In conjunction with the tour, the band released ""The Anthology,"" a two-CD set collecting remastered versions of most of the band's songs from the four albums recorded with the Corea/Di Meola/Clarke/White lineup.

They're partially right, especially in the Big budget/Indie darling oriented perspective that dominates internet gaming culture. That sort of stuff did sort of die out, with Brain Age and Kerbal and all this stuff kind of evolving from that in a way, but not really.

As I've dipped my toes into game studies and sort of different underground scenes, I've come to notice a lot of subcultures that people don't know about. I'm pretty sure there is a not-huge-but-notable scene of educational games in Europe. Especially eastern Europe.

I have a programmer friend who worked a quick job for what I heard was a Russian educational game. This was like 5-ish years ago? Especially for like elementary school kids, I think I've seen especially European schools use fairly classic style games for education. Shoot the asteroid with the correct math calculation, virtual hangman or h.o.r.s.e with letters. Yada yada yada. These can be difficult to find by just googling around, especially if you're limited to the English speaking world, but they should be out there. 

I'd love to be able to archive those games, as I'm sure many of them will or have already disappeared never to be experienced by anyone ever again, even though it's a large part of many people's childhood.

I don't know how prevalent they still are, but I'm positive that at least 10 years ago it wasn't unheard of at all to have games like that, so there were still games like that being developed around that time.

Now you have Quizlet, which is popular with universities. It has gamified elements with it's virtual pop quiz-style minigames like flashcards, connecting words as fast and accurately as possible, team vs. team style competitions etc.

There's also obviously an enormous amount of kids games like Barbie and Teddy Floppyear and weird phone games and apps. Some of those are definitely educational and some not. I bet if you go to the Google Play Store and type in ""Math game for kids"", you'll get tons of results.

It's certainly implied that the Castellan's predecessors weren't any more a model of stability than the little twerp you see face to face.

False,The_box_of_chocolate,,,,"People from all over the world want to come live in Canada because the prevalent culture, one based on universal values, the equality of men and women, the supremacy of the rule of law, the equality of everyone in front of the law, individual rights and freedoms and on the separation of Church and state, has made this country one of the best in the world.

Other countries with similar cultures are also sought after by immigrants; the UK, France, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Germany, the USA and most Western European countries. 

**This is because Western Occidental culture is not only good, it is often better.**

Theocracies, dictatorships, authoritarian/totalitarian regimes, Estate systems, Caste systems... All are found lacking when compared to the democratic, rights-based, law-based ""western"" societies and the  ultimate proof of that is in the millions who want to migrate to those said democracies. 

**Multi-ethnicity instead of multiculturalism**

The difference between Multi-ethnicity and multiculturalism rests on ""erasing"" or ""imposing"" the historical culture of one country. 

In a multi-ethnic Canada, people can be of all origins, all religions and all creed but the country imposes its culture on the newcomers, at least to the extent that the basic Canadian values are assumed to be accepted by all. Therefore, things such as Sharia Law courts, female genital mutilation and religious based isolation are rejected for being against the values of Canada. 

In a multicultural Canada, the assumption is that every culture is equally good, therefore, newcomers are encouraged to keep on acting as they did in their former countries while cultural and religious exceptions are provided in the name of ""diversity"". 

Multiculturalism results in a watering down of historical Canadian culture to the profit of other cultures. What made Canada the dream destination of many gets diluted. 

The risk is that Canada, deprived of its will to enforce the culture that made it great, will slowly transform into an unrecognizable mix of often incompatible cultures to, one day, stop being a place where everyone want to migrate to. 

**The equality of men and women is one of our greatest achievement**

When you think of a nice country to live in and of a bad country to live in, chances are that the ""good"" country is one where women enjoy gender equality and where the ""bad"" country is one where women are subjugated. 

I am not a feminist, just one who realizes that a GOOD country is one where people are equal, equal in rights and equal in responsibility. 

**We must be multi-ethnic but we must preserve our culture**

Democracy, rights and equality are the result of the evolution of our culture through time, throwing that away in order to not ruffle the feathers of someone who left his country to come here would be a great prejudice to our country, to its people and to its history.

&gt; **Posted by Bex_GGG** on Apr 04, 2018 09:44:41 AM UTC

&gt; [Image Link](https://web.poecdn.com/public/news/2018-04-04/HowWeMadeRoyaleHeader.jpg)

&gt; For our April Fool's day joke this year, we created a 100 player free-for-all battleground game mode called [PATH OF EXILE: ROYALE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWZ4tfOlC_g). While many community members initially assumed the news was a fake announcement (as is typical with April Fool's jokes), the real joke was that we actually made a real game mode and ran it until the end of April 1.

&gt; **The Creation of PATH OF EXILE: ROYALE**

&gt; As we're sure you have seen, battle royale games have been taking the game industry by storm over the last year. Recently, online games have been scrambling to add royale modes as quickly as possible to capitalise on the fervour. A couple of weeks before April Fool's day, it was becoming clear that our existing plan for a joke wasn't going to work as well as we thought, so we needed to come up with another idea.

&gt; The idea of announcing a battle royale game mode as a joke was pretty obvious (as evidenced by several other companies who had similar ideas), but Jonathan realised that we could actually implement the whole thing very quickly, creating an actual game mode for people to play for the day.

&gt; Our plan was to make the following changes to Path of Exile:

&gt; * Create a gigantic island with a bunch of tilesets jammed together.

&gt; * Populate the island with monsters and chests full of items.

&gt; * Use the existing cut-throat rules combined with a shrinking play area.

&gt; * Add support for up to 100 players per game instance. The existing limit was 32, as we used to pack the visibility data for a tile into a 32-bit integer.

&gt; * Make some server optimisations to distribute the large Royale instances over servers uniformly.

&gt; * Add a quick spectator mode for players who have been eliminated. (This is different to the type that would be used for race events in the future)

&gt; * Repurpose an existing but unreleased Rhoa Dinner hideout decoration as a prize.

&gt; Each of the above tasks applied to a different developer and looked like it would take less than one day. We decided to set a limit of one workday per person who wanted to work on it, so that our progress on the next content update wasn't disrupted too much. This limit was mostly respected, though the definition of ""workday"" was stretched considerably for one programmer.

&gt; As soon as Royale was playable, it became a huge sensation around our office. Whenever people were playtesting Royale, it drew large crowds of people watching.

&gt; Our plan was to deploy it at noon New Zealand time on Sunday April 1, which was around the start of April 1 in Europe and pretty late on the day before in America (so that it was clear it was a joke). We weren't sure how servers were going to perform, especially with instances that were this large, so we overspecced our server hardware just in case. We did not want to take the risk of having the new mode run into capacity problems or affect the regular game, especially on a holiday weekend (though we did end up having one realm issue, despite our efforts!). Now that we have run Royale for a day and a half, we have a lot of useful data that will help us predict server usage if we run it again in the future.

&gt; We launched the mode on time and it was a huge success on two levels. Most users loved the joke at face value, but also discovered that it was actually a real game mode they could play, and one that is a lot of fun. We also renamed the game on Steam to ""PATH OF EXILE: ROYALE"". Over the 31 hours that it was running, 27,989 matches of Royale were played. We had a great time running the event and watching the community's reaction to it. Many laughs were had.

&gt; **What's the Future of Royale?**

&gt; We have been inundated with requests to bring the mode back. It's a foregone conclusion at this stage that we'll be running it again in the future, but there's the big question of whether it can sustain itself enough to become a standalone game mode, or whether we should just have it as a cool event that we run occasionally. In either case, we have a lot of balance improvements planned that will make it more fun and less overrun by certain dominant skills.

&gt; As a community, how do you feel we should proceed? Is it worth the resources to take this one-day prototype and polish it into a standalone supported game mode with ongoing improvements? We'd love to hear your thoughts.

False,stairway-to-kevin,,,,"Sure, I'll even try to separate the main thesis from the short portion of racial differences.

So [this older paper](http://www.acteon.webs.upv.es/ARTICULOS/KEMPTHORNE-LOGICAL_EPISTEM-_1978-_BIOMETRICS.pdf) pre-empts the book and marks the clear limitations and flaws with hereditarian arguments from observational studies and the implications of how effective intervention may be.

[This paper](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/philosophy/docs/glymour/glymour1998.pdf) also levies some philosophical arguments against the methodology used in TBC.

[This paper](https://www.sociologicalscience.com/download/vol-3/july/SocSci_v3_520to539.pdf) tried to see how well predictions of TBC align with observed genetic trends and finds that predicted patterns don't hold.

[This meta-analysis](http://www.gregorycamilli.info/papers/early%20education%20interventions.pdf) seems to suggest that preschool has lasting cognitive and social benefits.

[This paper](http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/373/1743/20170064) introduces a model that suggests cultural inheritance plays a major role in human heritability

Also [this blog](http://bactra.org/weblog/520.html) post by a statistics professor is good

**As for the race chapter**:
Papers [here](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jelte_Wicherts/publication/227674177_Measurement_Invariance_in_Confirmatory_Factor_Analysis_An_Illustration_Using_IQ_Test_Performance_of_Minorities/links/59df0c96a6fdcca0d330a7cc/Measurement-Invariance-in-Confirmatory-Factor-Analysis-An-Illustration-Using-IQ-Test-Performance-of-Minorities.pdf) and [here](http://www.iapsych.com/iqmr/fe/LinkedDocuments/wicherts2010.pdf) seem to show that IQ measurements between racial groups may not be measuring the same thing (something called measurement invariance) and so comparisons may be made off of faulty data.

[This paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6203/7fcba9c327f484f2aeb28aff64bc5f8f2858.pdf) suggests differences in outcomes of transracial adoptions are artifacts of part of the study design

[This paper](http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/276/1667/2675.long) argues that heritability measures from one group don't provide information about the origin of group differences or the heritability in the other group.

**for some genetics takedowns of racial IQ differences**
[This population genetics  paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4516610/) argues that only about 10% of trait variation should be due to between group genetic differences in the absence of different selection between groups.

[This genetics paper shows](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2017/06/03/145755.full.pdf) fluid intelligence in the UK is not under selection.

[This paper](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/01/10/1612113114.full) from Iceland shows evidence that genetic scores educational attainment are slightly declining (even though educational attainment and IQ have been rising in Iceland during that time period) so genetic penetrance appears to be declining (or education/IQ polygenic scores are bad predictors).

[this paper](http://www.larspenke.eu/pdfs/Miller_&amp;_Penke_2007_-_Evolution_of_human_intelligence.pdf) shows brain volume has no strong relationship to IQ and no signs of selection across humans.

So in sum: Heritability studies can't make comments on causation or imply the effectiveness of intervention, genetic evidence doesn't confirm major theories/expected outcomes of TBC's thesis. IQ tests don't seem to measure the same thing between racial/international groups, heritability doesn't inform about group differences, and genetic theory doesn't predict major between group genetic differences based on our current understanding of the genetic architecture/selective pressures of IQ.

""The first thing that stands out about Harden is the fact that he is likely to be considered a below average athlete for the NBA level. His first step and pure explosiveness are nothing to write home about, meaning he has to find other ways to make his presence felt. 

Harden plays a European style of basketball, making simple plays on every possession. He's the consummate team player, showing extreme patience and never looking in a rush. He has a great assortment of hesitation moves and change of pace dribbles, often getting by players with a series of crafty maneuvers rather than with a pure first step. His physical attributes obviously aren't ideal, but he knows how to make the most of them, thanks to his terrific basketball IQ.""
