False,EdComment,1428755426.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_mud6g,False,"Toyota was removed from the latest Wangan Midnight revision in the Arcades in Japan and GT has had relatively little Toyota cars compared to PCARS 2 (Which while not Japan made. Bandai Namco published it globally. Suzuka seemed like they damaged relations enough that they couldn't solve that issue for PCARS 2), so not even Japanese games are safe. It sounds like a company issue and not a ""Xenophobia"" issue (C'mon people. Toyota's been a huge global concern since the 70's). I've seen some car blogs and forums point to decreasing car sales and younger people being way more interested in older models that don't make money compared to Toyota's newer line up which is why they have suddenly pulled from all sorts of younger skewing media including video games. Which is like, super dumb for their brand.   

I can't remember the exact interview but when a Ford rep was asked about why they were going big into Forza 6 with the GT as the cover car. They explained games are a great way to build badge loyalty and they make sure to get the entry level models in players hands globally so they can build attachment, and they also know older people with a bit more income play the game. So even when something is out of affordable range. There's still a model that's attractive. It's kind of an extension of when they were asked why they still stay in Stock Car racing. They don't sell a lot of Fusions. But they sell a lot of F-150 trucks based on it. And considering how prominent the F-150 is in Forza now (Including a ""Hero Car"" spot on the FH3 box art with the Lambo Centenario), it's a model they see targeted at the same people who play these games. 

Why Toyota isn't telling licensors that they can have the old models if they put that 300hp Camry and the Tundra in (Along with the new Corolla and the Yaris WRC car which is even sponsored by Microsoft) is kinda mind boggling when they could take that new Corolla, which is apparently going to be their new attempt at a younger market. And offer it with the older cars. Build a badge attachment like other companies do instead of just settling for an Econobox Soccer mom market while others like Mazda and Nissan are still building brand loyalty with the badge (Though if I were Mazda, I'd have a word on why the Mazda 3 didn't make the cut for the FH4 base game as its a popular model in the UK. Hopefully it shows up as a Forzathon car)

Also why you know there was a crapton of SUV's in Forza 7. Car Companies know people with purchasing power play these games and McLaren even sold a P1 after it was revealed on stage for Forza 5. There was a very famous effect on the sales of Nissan cars because of the original Gran Turismo where they couldn't ship Skyline GT-R's into Europe fast enough to meet demand and Honda allegedly paid a not insignificant amount of money to make sure the first car a player bought in Gran Turismo 5 and 6 was a Honda Fit. But I suppose, that's Toyota's prerogative. If they don't want to make people interested in the new Supra by offering both it and the older model in as many games as possible. That's on them.

False,negroyverde,1340138842.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_81unj,False,"&gt;Capitalism, meanwhile, has lead us into an age of unbelievable material prosperity.

To be honest, and I mean to be respectful in arguing this point, I think that this take mixes things up quite a bit. As the West secularized, capitalism took on religious qualities in the absence of the church, and this can confute matters greatly. Being ""led into an age"" where things are so much better is something that can only be accomplished by Christ and his church; we should be wary of secular economic ideology when it is similar to Catholic thought on this point, because it contains a bad seed. We cannot forget that capitalism has also created the most unequal society ever to exist, and has really been more of a moral cup-and-ball game than anything. When the gilded age ended in the US and Europe, it was really just exported elsewhere. Now the majority of the world's citizens languish in poverty, and first-world people have the gall to say that their system is better. Perhaps it is, but quite marginally; in truth, it offers us a very thin moral gain, if any. 

Distributism is superior because it takes an economic system that already works - guild-based, local agrarianism, with a heavy emphasis on community - and improves it from its medieval iteration. 

Obviously, communism is not a preferable system, at least insofar as it is imagined on 20th century terms, but a *communitarian* system, which is necessarily decentralized, humanizes economic arrangements in a fashion which is more conducive to Christlike conduct. Monopolistic, massive, unequal economic entities create a headless beast the sheer size of which causes men to risk their moral standing. 

And at any rate, in all of this, distributism is the fruit of the work of many Catholic scholars, and its groundwork was laid in *Rerum Novarum* - a work literally written by a great pope. It is solid and deserves a revival. Engaging in the ""capitalism versus communism"" debate is a far too worldly pursuit for a Christian to engage in, IMO.

Guardou os sentimentos para si mesmo e decidiu ver a sua nova posição de tenente como sua chance de prestar homenagens ao seu falecido companheiro. 

Algum tempo após avistarem a mansão, Kyrio e seu terceiro assentado conseguiram infiltrar com sucesso. Com suas identidades disfarçadas, descobriram o campo de concentração e, nele, uma grande quantidade de residentes presos. Sua missão acabara de tornar-se mais complicada. Agora, fora investigar, precisaria libertar aqueles residentes do campo. 

Kyrio sabia que precisava levar em consideração duas coisas. A primeira era que liberar o campo de concentração destruiria o propósito de uma missão de infiltração, que requer o mínimo de interferência possível para não causar suspeita. A outra, era o fato de que, como oficial superior, ele deveria enfrentar a luta mais difícil. Isso o levou a pensar se o melhor seria deixar Ryaku no campo ou para escoltar a carruagem de volta. 

Após um rápido raciocínio, colocou a sua mão no ombro de Ryaku e o olhou no fundo dos olhos. Pediu através de sua expressão para não agir ainda e para que seguisse ele de volta a carruagem. Quando chegaram perto dela e após se assegurar que ninguém estava lhes ouvindo, Kyrio ordenou seu terceiro assentado a ficar no campo de concentração. 

“Preciso que você fique aqui” ordenou. “Nossa missão acabou de ficar mais complicada e talvez precisaremos agir muito antes de entregar nossa informação coletada de volta ao esquadrão.”

Kyrio sutilmente retirou a zanpakuto de seu colega de baixo do assento e o escondeu embaixo de suas vestes. 

“Eu voltarei com a carruagem e irei aprofundar a investigação. Enquanto isso apenas colete mais informações sobre este acampamento e se prepare para tomá-lo caso eu lhe de o sinal. Fique atento ao céu.”

Com isso, o tenente preparou a jaula de drenagem e esperou ser liberado para ir até o destino dela e assim continuar a sua investigação. 


/////

Tenma e Majoda aproximaram-se da residência. Sua aparência era no mínimo suspeita. De todas as casas no distrito, essa era a mais suja e mal cuidada. Após bater a terceira vez na porta, sentiu seu pescoço aperta em diversos locais. 

Quatro civis surgiram em volta de Tenma, cada um empunhando um sabre curvo, quase circular, contra sua jugular. 

“Shinigamis nao sao bem vindos aqui.” Um deles proferiu, porém Tenma não o viu pois esse estava atrás dele.  “O pacto deve ser respeitado. Ou pretende começar algo além de sua compreensão, moleque?” 

Nenhum dos quatro emanava pressão espiritual, o que era estranho. 

“O pacto milenar se renova com o sangue real, e ele se encontra em risco.” Duas vozes uníssonas responderam. 

Devido a sua situação, Tenma não conseguiu olhar em direção das vozes, mas sabia que elas pertenciam aos gêmeos. Eles estavam em pé na parede, acima da porta, suas espadas uma em cima da outra formando um “X” e com as outras mãos apoiadas em cima das lâminas, numa pose ameaçadora. Os civis abaixaram suas armas e os Shinigamis foram convidados a entrar. 

Após algumas curvas nos corredores da residência, Tenma percebeu que na medida que andava, a decoração da casa ia ficando mais requintada. Ao seu aproximarem do destino, as paredes já eram adornadas por desenhos pintados em ouro, cercados por estátuas de mármore negro. 

Os oito chegaram até uma porta exageradamente adornada. Suas decorações, que mais se pareciam com estátuas na parede, formavam um cenário com dois homens lutando. Um vestia um kimono e o outro uma armadura tão exageradamente adornada quanto a porta. Suas espadas colidem uma com a outra. O que chamava a atenção, no entanto, era suas outras maos. Elas se estendiam, como se estivessem fazendo um apoio. 

“Apenas um impuro é permitido entrar por vez.” Um dos quatro servos disse.

Os shinigamis se entreolharam. Os gêmeos abriram mão, pois não gostavam de andar sozinhos. 

Tenma, então, sacou sua zanpakuto e a posicionou inteiramente sobre as mãos das esculturas. No momento em que fez isso, os dois homens na porta se distanciaram, abrindo passagem para o terceiro assentado. 

O shinigami fez seu caminho até o meio da sala, que era apenas um enorme tatame. No outro fim do quarto, um outro indivíduo estava sentado. Embora a sala estivesse bem iluminada, tudo em volta dele estava escuro e uma pressão espiritual assustadora emanava dele. Ela era mais tenebrosa do que o próprio capitão de Tenma.

Europe is a part of the West, and you seem to be looking at it from your perspective. I am talking in general about people from the West; USA, Canada, Europe, Aus/NZ. Without much difficulty, most people from these places can go live almost anywhere else in the West with minimal trouble adjusting to life in a new place there. We have a lot more in common than we don't. That's why it is not uncommon to find Europeans and Aus/Kiwis in America and vice versa. People from Africa, the Middle East or Asia will have a much more difficult time, on average, adjusting to life in the West because, besides some exposure to Western pop-culture, it is almost completely alien to them. 

&gt; I'm not slagging on Europe here. I just rather prefer they keep their socialism and low work ethic on their own side of the Atlantic.

You obviously are either confused or do not really know what life is like in Europe. There are no Socialist states in Europe. I believe you are confusing large bureaucracy and heavy state spending with socialism. Even the progressive hellhole that is Sweden is a highly capitalistic country. I personally know people, including family, who work in Europe and have very strong work ethic. Of course, this may not be so true in some areas of the public sector but this is also the case in the U.S.

It could be East European pirates or Colombian, French, Chinese pirates. You just went with your bias and decided on ""Mohammad."" Is there a specific reason (i.e. backstory for the antagonists) why you chose Somali pirates with Arab names?

Ok, fine, whatever. I don't want to be too PC about this but I do believe it's something to think about.

If you're going for a little realism (which I think you are, considering you're using a real life figure as a key character) and you’re set on using Somali pirates as the bad guys, I should tell you that it reads rather unreal to see ""elite"" pirates from Somalia raiding a cruise ship. Cruise ships are quite big and they have security. They're not easy to handle. Not like the cargo ship you saw on Captain Philips. And have you seen Somali pirates? These guys are dirt poor insipid amateurs. Where does the ""elite"" come from? 

Now, let's change the subject because there is actually something I wanted to ask you about the plot. Say you tweak some parts to get passed all of what I said above (ex. the pirates are a special group of trained insurgents that fled their country looking for money to fund their revolution. Hence, elite!). Why is it important that the protagonist is a drag queen? What does it add to the story? I'm guessing you're going for some comedic effect with the absurdity of it all but how does it affect plot points? How does the audience connect with him on a personal level?

Are you planning to establish him as an accomplished, top notch Seal? Because I think the fact that Teager (I really don't like this name. A Navy Seal named Bartholomew? Bart?) is a trained killer makes the story predictable. Which means you have to make the audience care especially more about Teager. You're going to need some good ideas to make the audience like a drag queen. 

Anyway, that went on a bit too long. 

Good luck.

They agree with me that circumcision is mutilation, they just can't believe such a horrible thing happens in the USA, a supposedly civilized, modern, free country.

Right now [Denmark](https://www.thelocal.dk/20180927/danish-parliament-to-consider-ban-on-circumcision-in-october-report) is moving to ban forced circumcision of children under 18. That makes sense to me. We don't allow parents to permanently modify the body of a child with tattoos. The child has to wait until he can comprehend the consequences and make a mature decision for himself, if he ever considers it at all. Personally, I have no tattoos or piercings, and I am grateful none were forced on me. I prefer to be natural.

&gt; On another note, I know at least a few grown men who did in fact, choose to be circumcised as adults. How was that not a choice? When they thought about it, knew what it entailed and did it anyways?

From a young age, natural, intact American boys are told that their penises are disgusting, ugly, hard to clean, and unhuman-looking. As a result of this bullying, some develop body image disorders or an sexual fetish for foreskin amputation. Couple this with common myths that cutting off the foreskin improves hygiene, prevents STIs, doesn't damage the penis, and only affects the appearance, and you end up with men who [later regret](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHGFx95D80) having chosen to mutilate themselves.

&gt; I'm an American woman of this generation. I've only encountered one uncircumcised penis. Sex has never been painful for me.

Some women do report painful dry sex, and they are blamed for it. It's the man's job to get hard, and the woman's job to get wet, right? Truth is soreness or dryness is not necessarily her fault. Circumcised men have a keratinized, dried out glans. Since circumcised men have lost so many nerves they can't feel sex very well, they tend to thrust harder and withdraw further away from the female. This pulls moisture out and exposes it to air. Foreskin lubricates the man by keeping the mucosa of the glans penis wet and smooth. It helps retain male pre-ejaculate and female lubricants. The shaft slides and glides within the foreskin, minimizing friction with the vaginal wall, increasing girth, and massaging the man's ridged band of nerves at the junction of the inner and outer foreskin. There is a rabbit hole of information to go down.

I recommend joining HRE and/or allying Austria, Poland and the emergent Western power (usually France, but a powerful Spain or GB also works.) Russia is somewhat difficult to ally, and does not have particularly high quality armies, so be aware of that if you go that route.

* England: Where I live. Politically a clusterfuck, hate it. The air is dirty in towns and the culture breeds everyone to be a wanker to each other, it's really individualist. Everyone is aggressive after 9pm and shitfaced. Most of the country is populated so there's not much wide open nature, though fortunately I live in a rural area.

* France: Been here 3-4 times. Paris is really touristy but I really like the architecture and vibe once you leave the main bits. Amazing rural villages / towns (look them up on google images).

* Germany: Been to Berlin on a school trip for a week, was a pretty cool place, very friendly. Was quite jarring / scary seeing all the cops with guns though. Interesting culture / history, especially if you're into war things. I like how it gets really cold (I enjoy the snow a lot) and then warm in the summer, nice mix.

* Austria: Really nice mountain regions with little villages / towns. If I could live anywhere in Europe it would be here. A lot like rural France.

* Spain: Way too hot for my liking, spent the entire 2 weeks basically in this gorgeous outdoor natural roman spa thing. Like [this](http://spanishsabores.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/7977337571_1fae0f7bc7_o.jpg) but with even clearer water, and lovely fish. Was paradise. Also lots of Oranges to steal.

* Croatia: Like Spain but less developed, quite nice actually. It feels really rural and undeveloped but not poor, lots of small places and lovely small towns nestled along beautiful warm coastline with amazing beaches. Also Ice Cream here is INCREDIBLY cheap, like £0.40 ($0.50) for a full cone, large selection of artisan flavors (Hazelnut is the best). Seriously I don't know how they are so cheap and so good, they rival most £3 ice creams you get in the UK.

* Netherlands: Loved this. Visited Amsterdam for 2 days, just cycled around and enjoyed the city. If you're into that kind of thing it's great, just taking in the hustle and bustle while you get to cycle (I like cycling). Afterwards I explored an under construction art warehouse type place that had scaffolding all over it, didn't even break in there was just a ladder. Got some great views and pictures that I'll never forget. Seems like a small thing, but I love urban exploration. Though I wouldn't spend more than 3 days here.

* Wales: Been here twice in the past year. Fantastic views and landscapes, like a mini Canada or something. Really accessible and lots to do if you enjoy nature. Amazing coastline with Seals, massive cliffs, and historical monuments. If you like wild swimming in the cold, it's great, though it is cold. Visited this in a campervan, was worth every moment.

* Scotland: Like Wales but even bigger / better landscapes, however there is a ton of midges which are really annoying and are hell if you're camping overnight anywhere. Seriously you could make a midge pie with the amount of midges we killed in just 1 night with spray. The campervan got clogged with them from just short exposure.

* Belgium: Makes a great shortcut for getting from France to the Netherlands on the motorway.

* Greece: Too hot and touristy, though if you're into that it's not that bad, but it's kind of cliche if that makes sense. Like going to New York instead of Utah imo, I would rather see the places that people don't usually go to and are outside of my normal culture / experience / comfort zone.

Otherwise I only eat 1-2 meals a day when traveling

For when I started out, I carried Quest protein bars and Quest hero bars (you'd need to check the sodium levels), other keto-ers like the kirkland protein bars. 

KetoSavage (google him) sells keto ""bricks"" that are 1k calories each and are not big. I've not eaten one yet but have some purchased so I can take it with me when I head to the EU this week. 

Most international hotels will have meat so you can get dinner and breakfast.  Lunch at the EU convention centers can be tricky as the lunch meat / cheese on sandwiches may be higher sodium than you'd like.    If you are fully in ketosis, you may be able to skip lunch and do breakfast /dinner at your hotel. 

Many groceries will have rotisserie chicken (parts or whole), even as early as at 8 am and you might be able to grab some to bring with you to the convention center.  in Switzerland - COOP is a good place to grab them. I've not had to search for something similar in Germany.

Consider emailing ahead to the hotel letting them know you have a severe sodium restriction and brittle diabetes and need meat cooked with very low sodium. You can inquire if the kitchen could make you a low sodium roasted piece of meat every day in a take away package you can bring with you. 

Salads with oil/vinegar can work in a pinch

&gt;I'm not disputing that a western culture exists, though it's an  amalgam, but anyone who cares to 'preserve' it from outsiders is likely  racist.

B) It didn't take us very long to get to the ever popular R word lol.

Would it be reasonable to assume that people who think it's acceptable to *cut off your daughters clitoris* because the Hadith gives it the OK *might* represent some sort of **serious and real threat** to Britain's future as a liberal, secular society?

What percentage of Somalians would *you* be comfortable with making up whatever country you come from (assuming America here)? And do you honestly think say, replacing 30 or 40% percent of the USA's current population with people from Central Africa wouldn't *fundamentally* change every aspect of American society *for the worse*?

Most western nations have [much more recent immigrants](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/16/upshot/comparing-immigration-policies-across-countries.html), percentage wise, than the US.   
   
&gt;EVERY POLITICAL REFUGEE HAS FLED THEIR COUNTRY RIGHT TO THE POLITICAL SAFETY OF THE US.   
   
Most refugees actually flee to [other third world countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_refugee_population). Refugees per capita, the US is at around the middle of the list, lower than the majority of the developed countries. Turkey has the most number of total refugees. The US accounts for 0.4% of the world's total refugees (267k of 65.6 million). TIL less than one percent = every.   
   
&gt;Once you put a limitation on freedom of speech that is no longer freedom of speech   
   
Every country limits freedom of speech to some extent. The US has limits on certain hate speech as well. Limits to freedom of speech in America:   
   
&gt;1: Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568 (1942), concerning verbal insults in public places.   

&gt;In 1942, the United States Supreme Court convicted a man who addressed a police officer as a ""God damned racketeer"" and ""a damned fascist"". The Court's opinion in the case stated that there was a category of ""fighting words,"" that was outside of the protection of the First Amendment: those words ""which by their very utterance inflict injury"" and which ""are no essential part of any exposition of ideas.” […] “Fighting words” are words that incite hatred or violence; essentially a form of hate speech.  
   
&gt;2: Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444 (1969), concerning government’s ability to punish provactive speech.   
   
&gt;The Supreme Court held that government can punish inflammatory speech if that speech is directed to inciting, and is likely to incite, lawless action.   
    
   
Hate speech in Europe is also limited, maybe even more (rightfully so). Outward sexism, homophobia, racism, and Neo-Nazism is illegal in most of the EU. Is that such a bad thing? Is persecuting Nazis and discriminatory people such a burden on freedom of expression? Imo, it only protects people (from discrimination). Other than that, all of the European Union guarantees general freedom of expression, at least to which it does not violate or discrimination against others:   
   
&gt;Article 11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union:   
1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers.   
2. The freedom and pluralism of the media shall be respected.   
   
Also, remember [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakota_Access_Pipeline_protests)? If that's not a huge violation of freedom of speech by America's part, I don't know what is.   
LOGIC: In the US, Neo-Nazis are given a platform with no penalty, yet they'll arrest and convict hundreds of Native Americans just for protesting against a destructive oil pipeline by the gov't.

I can remember being at work years ago and several people were standing around talking and started talking about fat people.  One person out of view but in ear-shot heard this.  It wasn't person specific, but about fat people in general and why they don't do something about it.

I could see she was shamed as I was not that far away from the whole thing.

Shame is powerful and it can be used to change people's behavior.  Look at how much of life is about losing weight.  Gyms, food, etc...  If a person takes better care of themselves for reasons of shame or vanity, the end result is that at least in part, they take better care of themselves.

My mom and sister were both heavy.  Both died young and had every excuse in the book to blame for their weight.  I was roommates with my sister when she fell on hard times.  She used to wake up very early and eat, then go back to sleep, wake up and have breakfast.  I can't even remember the last time I ate breakfast.

She ignored the shaming, never lost weight and died pretty young from health related issues.

You're version of ""that's life"" is not really how life is.

We come from nature, just like rabbits and wolves.  We are designed to compete and work, some can't compete, so they don't.  Rabbits don't work together, the don't have the intelligence to work together.  Wolves do, wolves are smarter than rabbits.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/K_selection_theory

Some see life like what you describe where people don't want to or shouldn't want to compete.  The reality is that all the life that nature has created, competes.  Find ANY form of life that doesn't.  Trees fight for sun, wolves fight for food.  If wolves and lions didn't fight for food, they die.

If people don't take care of their health, the chances of early death are greater.

Just look at all the cancers and other things that are effected by weight.  Did we have these problems in 1900?  Look at a picture from 1900 and compare it to today.  You see hats, lean people well dressed.  Now you see most people obese or overweight and little care for social graces.

Most anyone can become obese or a drunk or a drug addict or whatever else, if they don't respond to shame (which is pretty powerful) then they just die young or whatever life they end up with.

Look at nature, humans come from nature.  Try to develop a system that doesn't have this, it just doesn't work.

Nature is stronger than you.  If people don't respond to social shaming for these kinds of things, they usually die younger.

It really doesn't matter the motivation, vanity, shame, should, shouldn't...  I see life as nature, nature is about competing.

My other favourite thing about still being child free and now working full time - being able to more easily afford and justify nice things and hobbies. I once spent $200 on oversized yarn to make a jumbo knitted blanket - and because I'm good at saving and budgeting, it wasn't even a problem.

  
Also though, I'd still add in a responsible suggestion of start saving. It doesn't have to be much, but the difference getting into good financial habits now makes than in 10 years is huge.

Camarades du FL, c'est avec la force et la vitesse d'un boulet de canon que ce qui s'est passé ce weekend me propulse, moi, simple lurker, dans les rangs de celles et ceux qui ont des histoires de cœur à étaler ici. Je vais surement en écrire des tonnes mais je sais que vous n'avez que ça à faire un lundi matin.



Edit: c'est très long, désolé, TLDR en fin de post.



En fait, j'en ai déjà parlé, de mes aventures, mais c’était il y a déjà deux ans et depuis, bon il ne s'est rien passé de notable pour que cela me retourne assez pour venir ~~me vanter~~ geindre ici.



Pour faire un résumé rapide, je suis un homme, petite vingtaine qui a eu une aventure avec sa crush du lycée/meilleure amie et qui s'est terminée brutalement il y a quasiment deux ans déjà, et a qui je ne parle plus. Cette rupture m'a fait beaucoup de mal, et je n'ai jamais réussi à ré-exprimer mes sentiments aux filles qui me plaisaient (ce qui est déjà très rare), en plus de me complexer encore plus qu'avant et m'a poussé très longtemps, et encore aujourd'hui, à me perdre dans les souvenirs, bons ou mauvais que j'avais de cette relation (4 ans de crush/amitié, quelques semaines de ""relation""). Si vous vous ennuyez, tout le reste est dans mon historique.



Bref, il ne s'est rien passé de fort excitant de ce côté ces deux dernières années, un baiser à une soirée avec une fille pour qui j'avais le béguin. On l’appellera ~~A~~ **Février** (C'est totalement arbitraire mais c'est tout de même mieux que des lettres hein).

Baiser qui, fort agréable sur le moment, certes, m'a complètement déboussolé, tellement que j'ai évité cette fille qui est pourtant vraiment quelqu'un de sympathique et joviale, pendant une semaine avant de lui envoyer un sms en panique lui demandant si je n'avais pas fait de la merde et que si c’était le cas j’étais désolé etc etc. Elle m'a répondu que non, absolument pas, que c’était super et m'a rassuré mais je n'ai pas osé continuer dans ce sens.



Je suis quelqu'un d'assez à l'aise quand je me sens bien, je me fais facilement des ami-es de soirée, voire des amis proches, mais j'ai beaucoup de mal à passer ce cap de l'amitié et même a devenir ""intime"", que ce soit parce que j'exprime ou de manière plus tactile avec des filles, alors que je n'ai pas ce problème là avec des mecs (genre j'ai aucun problème a faire la bises ou a faire des calins à mes amIs, mais beaucoup plus a mes amIEs), et ce pourtant en ayant un cercle social majoritairement composé de femmes, en raison de mon champ d'étude. Je me confie beaucoup plus facilement à un ami qu'a une amie(et même à un ami c'est tout de même compliqué, d'où ce throwaway d'ailleurs, si tu pense savoir qui je suis hésite pas, j'ai rien à cacher j'arrive juste pas à dire les choses), et quand j'ai des sentiments pour cette amie, ça devient encore plus compliqué car pas envie de perdre cette relation. Bon, fin de ce ^premier^désolé aparté.



Il faut savoir que Février est tellement affective qu'il est parfois compliqué de la cerner, et si elle te câline parce tu es son ami ou si c'est plus que ça. Le crush a duré encore quelques mois et puis, à force de répression, a fini par s'en aller et s'est porté sur une autre amie, que nous appellerons **Mai** avec qui je m'entend très bien et que je trouve magnifique, là aussi l'attirance que j'avais pour elle a fait des hauts et des bas et a atteint un point culminant cet été, où nous sommes partis en vacances avec une bonne partie de mon ancienne classe, dont faisaient partie Février et Mai. Mon crush sur la première s'étant terminé, je n'avais d'yeux que pour la seconde mais ma timidité ainsi que l'incertitude de mes sentiments dû au fait que ma première relation, en partant, ai brisée ma boussole amoureuse en partant, et que du coup je ne sais plus a quel point j'aime les gens, si je suis attiré uniquement par le physique, par l'envie d'avoir quelqu'un dans ma vie, par un manque terrible d'intimité, la pression sociale etc, m'ont empêché de dire quoi que ce soit, et, comme dit au dessus, j’étais tiraillé par la peur de tout foutre en l'air et de perdre une amie qui m'est chère.





J'ai passé le mois à me morfondre, plus sûr de mon amour pour Mai que jamais (tout en en doutant bien évidemment, ça serait trop simple) et jeudi dernier, je suis allé chez un ami proche car il fallait absolument que je me confie, chose que j'ai voulu faire depuis mon retour mais que la vie m'avait rendue impossible. Même en étant très proche de cette personne, j'ai toujours du mal a me confier en général, je n'y arrive que dans des contextes bien spécifiques,quand ce n'est pas par le moyen de lettres (ou de post reddit) seul à seul, la nuit après une soirée arrosée, sur le pas d'une porte ou dans un dernier noctilien, me laissant une porte de sortie pour fuir et une transition nette entre la conversation et le futur. Prétextant une connerie à lui ramener, je passe, on discute, on joue, mais je n'arrive pas à franchir le point de non retour, la première phrase de mes aveux, celle qui m'empêche de faire demi-tour et qui me pousse à vider mon sac. C'est sur le pas de la porte que j'y arrive et que je lui lance ce qui me tracasse depuis un mois; mon ami a couché avec Février pendant ce séjour estival alors qu'il savait que j'avais eu des sentiments pour elle et ne m'en a pas touché un mot, ni avant, ni après, et c'est ce mutisme uniquement, qui m'a blessé. On s'explique, il s'excuse, et on se met a discuter de pourquoi je n’arrive pas a me confier, à m'exprimer sur les sujets qui me sont douloureux et pourquoi je tente à ce point de refréner ces pensées. D'ailleurs c'est pour ça que j'utilise un autre compte, je sais que des connaissances traînent dans le coin (coucou !). Cette discussion me pousse à lui parler de tout ce qui va mal dans ma vie, mes complexes, la forte probabilité que je fasse une dépression depuis des années, et bien sûr, de ce que j'éprouve pour la belle Mai, et il tente de me convaincre de tout lui dire à la soirée qui a lieu chez elle le lendemain. C'est vrai qu'au fond, je n'ai rien à perdre, Mai étant assez ouverte et sympathique pour ne pas mal le prendre, et, m'attendant à un râteau, c'est plus pour me délester d'un poids que pour autre chose. On reste amis et je cesse de me tourmenter, move on etc. Bon évidemment il fallait trouver les conditions propices à ça mais il faut bien se dire au revoir et qui dit au revoir, dis pas de la porte, vous aurez compris le plan. L'alcool aidant, je sais que si l'occasion se présente, je me tiendrais a mon engagement. Il est cinq heures du matin, je reste dormir chez mon ami.





Vendredi soir, la soirée bat son plein (autant que possible à 15 dans un appartement parisien) et je revois plein d'amis de la classe. Je bois beaucoup, sans trop réussir à parler avec Mai (la disposition des chaises/canap/tables basses/etc empêche de papillonner et de changer de discussion aussi souvent que le voudrait), qui boit plus que moi, ce qui fait qu'elle finit par faire une sieste sur un canap avant que les quelques survivants encore debout ne la couchent.



Ça ne sera pas pour ce soir donc.



Ce soir, en revanche, c'est le plus gros plot twist de ma vie, et la raison de ce post. Il ne reste que quelques personnes, je m'apprête à partir, on me dit que je peux rester dormir mais je décline, invoquant mon état nauséeux, une fois de plus j'ai bu trop, et trop vite. En partant, une autre amie, que nous appelleront Septembre, passablement ivre me serre dans ses bras en me tannant pour que je reste, je m'extirpe et m'enfonce dans la nuit Parisienne, à la recherche d'un vélib avec qui affronter les 40 minutes qui me séparent de mon lit tandis que je raconte mon échec à un autre ami, d'un autre cercle, qui me ressemble dans bien des aspects. Alors que j'enfourche mon destrier (un électrique ne plus, grand luxe), Septembre me renvois un message pour savoir si je peux vraiment pas rester, ce que j’interprète comme un message d'amie ivre qui ne m'a pas vu depuis longtemps. J'arrive, tant bien que mal chez moi, me précipite aux toilettes histoire de passer une nuit, ou ce qu'il en reste dans le meilleur des états et c'est à ce moment que Septembre me dit qu'elle aurait tout de même bien voulu dormir avec moi.

&gt;While European governments deny paying ransoms, an investigation by The New York Times found that Al Qaeda and its direct affiliates have taken in at least $125 million in revenue from kidnappings since 2008, of which $66 million was paid just last year.
In news releases and statements, the United States Treasury Department has cited ransom amounts that, taken together, total around $165 million over the same period.
These payments were made almost exclusively by European governments, which funneled the money through a network of proxies, sometimes masking it as development aid, according to interviews conducted for this article with former hostages, negotiators, diplomats and government officials in 10 countries in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. The inner workings of the kidnapping business were also revealed in thousands of pages of internal Qaeda documents found by this reporter while on assignment for The Associated Press in northern Mali last year.
In its early years, **Al Qaeda received most of its money from deep-pocketed donors, but counterterrorism officials now believe the group finances the bulk of its recruitment, training and arms purchases from ransoms paid to free Europeans.**
Put more bluntly, Europe has become an inadvertent underwriter of Al Qaeda.
The foreign ministries of Austria, France, Germany, Italy and Switzerland denied in emails or telephone interviews that they had paid the terrorists. “The French authorities have repeatedly stated that France does not pay ransoms,” said Vincent Floreani, deputy director of communication for France’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

&gt;Several senior diplomats involved in past negotiations have described the decision to pay ransom for their countries’ citizens as an agonizing calculation: Accede to the terrorists’ demand, or allow innocent people to be killed, often in a gruesome, public way?
**Yet the fact that Europe and its intermediaries continue to pay has set off a vicious cycle.
“Kidnapping for ransom has become today’s most significant source of terrorist financing,”** said David S. Cohen, the Treasury Department’s under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, in a 2012 speech. **“Each transaction encourages another transaction.”**

It further strengthens my above point that giving in to the system is basically supporting the system.

To answer your question above:

&gt; How is buying and freeing slaves supporting evil practices? **It’s like saying that paying ransom supports kidnappers**

For myself as Alliance in quickmatch PvP we have to really push in order to win. End up losing more than winning to be honest.

&gt;Indeed, he asserts that ""one of the great puzzles that has confronted the students of anti-semitism is the alleged shift from pro-Jewish statements found in the first pagan writers who mention the Jews ... to the **vicious anti-Jewish statements** thereafter, **beginning with** [**Manetho**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manetho) **about 270** [**BCE**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCE)"". In view of Manetho's anti-Jewish writings, **antisemitism may have originated in Egypt and been spread by ""the** [**Greek**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks) retelling of [Ancient Egyptian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt) prejudices"".  
&gt;  
&gt;The first clear examples of anti-Jewish sentiment can be traced back to [Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria) in the 3rd century BCE. [**Manetho**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manetho)**, an Egyptian priest and historian of that time, wrote scathingly of the Jews.**  
&gt;  
&gt;The ancient Jewish philosopher [Philo of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo_of_Alexandria) describes an attack on Jews in Alexandria in 38 CE in which thousands of Jews died. **The violence in Alexandria may have been caused by the Jews being portrayed as** [**misanthropes**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misanthropy)**.** Tcherikover argues that **the reason for hatred of Jews in the Hellenistic period was their separateness in the Greek cities.** Bohak has argued, **however,** that early animosity against the Jews cannot be regarded as being anti-Judaic or antisemitic unless it arose from attitudes that were held against the Jews alone, and that many **Greeks showed animosity toward any group they regarded as barbarians**.  
&gt;  
&gt;Edward Flannery writes that it was **the Jews' refusal to accept Greek religious and social standards that marked them out.**  
&gt;  
&gt;[Manetho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manetho), an Egyptian historian, wrote that **the Jews were expelled Egyptian** [**lepers**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy)**.**

In the middle ages according to the same Wiki:

&gt;In the 12th century, **there were Christians who believed that some, or possibly all, of the Jews possessed magical powers and had gained these powers from making a pact with the** [**devil**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil)**.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Many Christians, including members of the [clergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clergy), have **held the Jewish people collectively responsible for killing Jesus.**  
&gt;  
&gt;As the [Black Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death) [epidemics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemics) devastated Europe in the mid-14th century, annihilating more than a half of the population, Jews were taken as [scapegoats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapegoat#Political/sociological_scapegoating). Rumors spread that they caused the disease by deliberately [poisoning wells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well_poisoning).

Even more modern and specifically in the United States:

&gt;Beginning in the early 1880s, declining farm prices also prompted elements of the [Populist movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Party_(United_States)) to blame the perceived evils of capitalism and industrialism on Jews because of **their alleged racial/religious inclination for financial exploitation and, more specifically, because of the alleged financial manipulations of Jewish financiers** such as the Rothschilds. Although Jews played only a minor role in the nation's commercial banking system, **the prominence of Jewish investment bankers** such as the [Rothschilds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothschild_family) in Europe, and [Jacob Schiff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Schiff), of [Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuhn,_Loeb_%26_Co.) in New York City, **made the claims of anti-Semites believable to some.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Where before 1900, American Jews never amounted even to 1 percent of America's total population, by 1930 Jews formed about 3½ percent. **This dramatic increase and the upward mobility of some Jews was accompanied by a resurgence of antisemitism**.

Nazi Germany:

&gt;After Hitler came to power in 1933, the Nazi regime sought the systematic exclusion of Jews from national life. **Jews were demonized as the driving force of both International Marxism and Capitalism.**

It seems like they are just blamed for everything for no reason, or just blamed for apparently being good with their money when other people are falling on harder times. I hope any of that helped at all, because I have always wondered as well why Jewish people get so much hatred when you literally cannot identify a Jewish person by just looking at them. Plenty of people who are Jewish don't ""look it"" and plenty of people who aren't Jewish could pass for Jewish. I think it's really just because they were different in some way than the ruling class in Greece (from the quick read I did it appears that the people of Israel existed in Crete which is in Greece) and then once they were put down and seen as less than, everyone kind of kept jumping on the bandwagon and blamed/hated the Jews just because they could.

Study: Parliamentary Systems Have Longer Shelf Life Than Presidential Ones

During the past 30 years, only 35 states have maintained stable, continuous democracies, according to the Freedom House political index. Of those, 31 (almost 90 percent), are parliamentary systems, with the others being the United States, Costa Rica, Venezuela and Colombia.

""Switching to a presidential system now would probably mark the end of democracy in Israel,"" says Naomi Chazan, head of the School of Government and Society at the Academic College of Tel Aviv-Yaffo

""I don't want to bring Venezuela's and Colombia's problems to Israel,"" says Dr. Reuven Hazan of the department of political science at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. ""A president like Hugo Chavez is all we need.""

The authors of the report, Hazan and Professor Avraham Diskin, examined 60 democracies in 2005 in their study entitled ""Why Democracies Collapse."" Close to two-thirds of the democracies that collapsed were presidential systems, and only one-third were parliamentary. Also, three-quarters of the stable democracies are parliamentary, while a quarter are presidential.

The Megidor Committee set up by President Moshe Katsav to examine the government structure in Israel is to submit its report in the next few days. It will recommend strengthening the parliamentary system and not move over to a presidential system. A sub-committee of the Megidor Committee, headed by Chazan, compared the success rate of parliamentary and presidential systems. Chazan's research assistant, Nir Atmor, was in charge of concentrating the data.

""In every comparison, the parliamentary systems received higher marks than presidential systems,"" the Chazan committee concludes. ""Most indexes place Israel at the bottom on the parliamentary systems, close to the better presidential systems. Parliamentary systems function much better than presidential systems, that's unequivocal,"" Chazan says.


In a study cited by the Chazan report, 40 percent of the presidential systems from 1973 to 1989 have undergone military coups. ""This is sufficient to substantiate the argument against the presidential systems,"" the report concludes. ""Presidential systems rise and fall, and disappear,"" says Chazan. ""And they display a serious tendency toward dictatorship.""

South American states tried to copy the American presidential system, Dr. Hazan says. As a result, by the end of the 1970s, not a single Latin American democracy remained. They all collapsed, and the army stepped in after the system stopped working, he says.

According to the democracy lifespan index of Polity IV Project (data until 2003), only three presidential systems are among the 20 longest lasting democracies. The average lifespan of the 33 parliamentary systems is 48 years. The average lifespan of the 17 presidential systems is 24 years, including the United States. Without the U.S., the presidential system's lifespan average drops to 17 years.


Chazan rejects the argument that Israeli democracy is not stable. She agrees that governments have a stability problem, but says ""our long-term record is amazing."" She says that of all the post-colonial states that achieved independence after World War II, only two - India and Israel - lasted as democracies throughout the period.

""Israel has existed for 58 years. There is no presidential system apart from the U.S. and Costa Rica that has lasted for 58 years,"" Dr. Hazan says.

One indicator of a trend toward dictatorship is to watch how many people in surveys agree with a statement like, ""a strong leader is better for the country than elections and parliament.""

Out of the 47 democracies examined in the World Values Survey, the 20 countries in which the yearning for a strong leader was the lowest were parliamentary democracies. The average of those craving for a strong leader in parliamentary systems was 29 percent, compared to 46 percent in presidential systems. In Israel, the longing for a strong leader is especially strong - 56 percent - despite the parliamentary system.

Diskin wrote in an article that ""the main problem of a presidential system involves a possible clash between the executive authority and the judicial branch.""

Such a clash ""could paralyze the system and is potentially violent. There are several examples of democracies that have collapsed following such a clash. The U.S. is a rare example of a presidential system in which there has not been a violent clash like this,"" he said.

Does a presidential system really increase government efficiency, as Yisrael Beitenu leader Avigdor Lieberman suggests? Does it make it easier to govern and implement policy?

The World Bank's government efficiency index gives parliamentary systems an average of 78 and presidential systems only 49. There is not a single presidential system among the top 10 efficient democracies (the U.S. is 11th). In contrast, 17 of the 20 least efficient states (out of 60) are presidential democracies.

Almost all the government systems in Western Europe, the largest, most stable concentration of democracies, are parliamentary. Presidential systems are prevalent in Third World areas such as Latin America, Africa and Asia. The fact that most of Israel's grades are between the presidential and parliamentary systems indicates the deterioration of the quality of government in the country from Western to Third World norms.",True,False,False,,0,1538379086,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e6ygl9g,False,t3_9ke9re,True,t3_9ke9re,/r/Philippines/comments/9ke9re/just_waiting_for_people_debunking_this/e6ygl9g/,,1539905166,1,True,False,Philippines,t5_2qjov,r/Philippines,public,

Så hvad er det? Bestem dig lige ellers kan vi ikke rigtigt diskutere det.

Konteksten af det her kommentarspor fik mig til at tro, at du ville skyde på folk, så undskyld misforståelsen, hvis det var en misforståelse.

&gt;Jeg har på intet tidspunkt sagt at vi skal skyde nogen. Jeg siger bare, at grænserne ikke er noget værd, hvis man ikke forsvare dem. Forsvaret af dem skal være ligefremt propertionalt med den modstand man møder.

Men er der overhovedet nogen der egentlig er uenige med det?

&gt;Hele ideen med den frie bevægelighed i EU byggede jo på at vi så sammen bestemte hvem der kom ind.

Skal Spanien bestemme, hvem der må komme ind i Danmark?

Asylansøgere har rettighed til beskyttelse og at have deres sag hørt gennem flere internationale aftaler underskrevet årtierne efter 2. verdenskrig, så det er anderledes end immigration som sådan.

&gt;Jeg så helst ikke at vi skulle skyde nogen, men omvendt må vi også sikre at folk der får behandlet deres sager korrekt og på en ordentlig måde, ikke bliver overhalet af folk der bare vader ind i Europa som vi så det tidligere.

Jeg kan ikke rigtigt se, hvordan vi bliver overhalet, men jeg synes vi burde samarbejde mere på flygtningeområdet i EU eller på endnu bredere plan. Både i forhold til bekæmpning af menneskesmugling, men også i forhold til fordeling af flygtninge.

Vi bliver også nødt til at anerkende, at vores politikker har været med til at skabe nogle af de kriser, som de flygter fra. Når vi har så mange flygtninge betyder det, at der er meget ustabilitet i verden. Tror du Vesten har været med til at skabe noget af ustabliteten? Kig på Afghanistan, Irak og Libyen!

Samtidigt er vi også nogle af de rigeste lande i hele verden, hvilket i stor grad er som resultat af århundreders udnyttelse af fattige lande til den dag i dag, hvor vi støtter militser i Congo, som kontrollerer minerne med de metaller, som vi bruger i vores mobiler og computere, og udnytter billig arbejdskraft i den tredje verden.

Outwith is a new Scottish based podcast that aims to cover stories from around the world.

Since the fall of communism in 1989, Romania has been working hard to tackle corruption and has been widely praised for its efforts. But almost 3 decades on, it remains one of the most corrupt countries in Europe, and its people are sick of it.  So what is being done to tackle this, why hasn't more progress been made, and what is the former Mayor of New York doing mixed up in it all?  We spoke to Kit Gillet, a journalist who reports from Bucharest for the New York Times.

Yet they have 50 million cattle (one of the largest herds in the world), as well as 50 million sheep and goats and 35 million chickens, needlessly consuming their food, land, and water. Ethiopia is cutting down 25,000 acres of its forests each year in order to make more room for their growing herd of livestock, while contributing heavily to greenhouse gas emissions along the way. The country of Eritrea has a human population of 5 million people, the majority of whom suffer from hunger and poverty. Yet they are using their sparse resources to support 6 million cattle, sheep, and goats. Eighty-two percent of the world’s starving children live in countries where food is fed to animals, which are then killed and eaten by wealthier individuals in developed countries like the US, UK, and in Europe. One fourth of all grain produced by third-world countries is now given to livestock, in their own countries and elsewhere. Therefore, on a local basis, animal-based agriculture simply perpetuates hunger, poverty, and other components of the cycle such as illiteracy (as high as 66 percent in some countries) and poor human health. 
Statistics from https://www.forksoverknives.com/animal-agriculture-hunger-and-how-to-feed-a-growing-global-population-part-one-of-two/#gs.CaS54lQ

Climate Change: Animal agriculture is responsible for 18 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. Livestock and their byproducts account for at least 32,000 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year, or 51% of all worldwide greenhouse gas emissions. Livestock is responsible for 65% of all human-related emissions of nitrous oxide – a greenhouse gas with 296 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide, and which stays in the atmosphere for 150 years. 5% of water consumed in the US is by private homes 55% of water consumed in the US is for animal agriculture. Animal agriculture is the leading cause of species extinction, ocean dead zones, water pollution, and habitat destruction. A farm with 2,500 dairy cows produces the same amount of waste as a city of 411,000 people. The list goes on and on... Taken from http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts/

Terrorism? Well I would say an animal holocaust is an act of terrorism. If killing is a way for farmers to meet the demands of their community the best to fight that is by educating and changing those demands to more efficient, sustainable ones while maintaining a respect towards all forms of life. Eating meat has been a tradition in human history,but so has pillaging, rape, murder, slavery, misogyny, etc. We can't call ourselves civilized and continue these practices of animal agriculture. I have more respect for indigenous cultures who go out to the wilderness and hunt for their meal and use every bit of the animal´s body and keep it sacred to their culture.

Regarde la crise aux USA, la presque crise en Espagne, l'état de l'immobilier à Paris ou à Londres (où le marché semble ok uniquement à cause de l'import d'argent étranger, sinon les prix sont bien trop élevé et le marché tomberait) ...

En soit, ta maison / ton habitation principal, c'est bien évidemment ton investissement principal; parce que sa valeur financière n'est qu'une note de bas de page, ce qu'elle t'apporte c'est un toit. Mais passé ça, l'immobilier en tant qu'investissement, c'est oui une valeur très sure, mais *sur la durée*.

Je précise que comme dans mon poste au dessus, je ne parle pas pour quelqu'un qui a vraiment beaucoup d'argent (auquel cas la règle, c'est de diversifier, justement au cas où un de tes investissement se casse la gueule). Et monsieur pas spécialement riche mais qui a un investissement, quand la crise tombe, il a besoin que son argent soit disponible facilement. Hors, s'il est certain que son immobilier, *sur la durée*, va monter en valeur, il est aussi très probable qu'au coeur de la crise sa valeur tombe, souvent très bas - hors c'est justement le moment où il a besoin de le vendre pour avoir accès à son argent.

On a vraiment un excellent exemple avec 2007 aux USA, et les gens qui vendent leur maison bien moins cher que ce qu'ils l'ont acheté pour s'en sortir en période de crise (parce que perdu leur emploi, et besoin de ressources). Comme en plus c'était une explosion de bulle immobilière, ça a fait double effet, et pendant longtemps tu trouvais des maisons à quelques milliers d'euros aux enchères vendues par les banques ... Dans ce contexte, comment toi tu veux vendre ta maison juste à côté à un prix raisonnable.

C'est une des règles de l'investissement qui est souvent oublié: ce qui compte ça n'est pas juste la valorisation de ton investissement (est-ce qu'il gagne bien en valeur sur la durée), c'est aussi ton accès à tes liquidités; est-ce que tu peux avoir l'argent sur ton compte en banque rapidement quand tu en a besoin, sans trop perdre en route. L'immobilier n'est pas très bon dans ce domaine. Et moins tu es riche, plus ce critère est important.

Si tu as peur de la prochaine crise: achète des lingots d'or, et met les en coffre à la banque :) (ça ne veut pas dire que l'or ne perd pas de valeur, mais qu'il est une des valeurs sures: il ne perdra jamais 90% de sa valeur en quelques jours, sauf événement du type ""l'argent ne compte plus de toute façon"") 

&gt; Mmm... Les banques ont eu des maisons sur le dos parce qu'elle ont fortement incité les gens à les hypothéquer non ? (pas sûr de la précision du terme).

Pas des hypothèque, mais des prêt. Je te prête 1000e pour acheter/construire une maison, et tu me rembourse 10e par mois. Dans le concept ça ce passe bien, sauf que les banques ont eu une idée foireuse: la valeur de l'immobilier monte, donc la maison a plus de valeur pour nous que le prêt ! Si on brade la vérification de ses comptes, et que le mec n'est pas capable de rembourser 10e par mois (mettons il a un salaire de 5e mais on lui accorde le prêt quand même), bah c'est cool: après quelques mois, il sait plus rembourser, on récupère la maison, et on la revend ! Tu multiplies ça par des millions d'américains, et toutes les banques qui se jettent là dedans, et d'un coup l'immobilier s'effondre complètement, les maisons ne valent plus rien, ni les prêts (puisque les gens savent pas les rembourser).

Et là l'investisseur ""propre"", toi, qui a juste acheté sa maison comme valeur d'investissement sur, il peut rien y faire: son investissement perd quasiment toute sa valeur, pile en pleine crise quand il perd son boulot et a besoin d'argent.

Less than 10% of the population of A-L opted to retain French citizenship, which roughly coincides with census data on the French minority post-1871. While most people were against the annexation, the vast majority of people there already spoke German - the 10% are the result of the heavily French-speaking areas of Lorraine (~20% as a whole, over 60% in the border regions), in Alsace it had been less than 5%. Furthermore, the German government was pretty lenient with the French-speaking population, decreeing French as a secondary official and as a schooling language in every area with a French plurality, which AFAIK is more than what the French ever did for the German majority(!) post-1815.

Seriously, Wilhelmine Germany was only semi-democratic and borderline authoritarian at times, in particular in regard to the pre-1913 military, but it's not like it was extremely regressive compared to other polities of the period.

False,_Steamed_Hams,1520384189.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_109jzthf,,"A European Union privacy watchdog could fine Facebook Inc. FB -2.59% as much as $1.63 billion for a data breach announced Friday in which hackers compromised the accounts of more than 50 million users, if regulators find the company violated the bloc’s strict new privacy law.

Ireland’s Data Protection Commission, which is Facebook’s lead privacy regulator in Europe, said Saturday that it has demanded more information from the company about the nature and scale of the breach, including which EU residents might be affected.

In an emailed statement, the regulator said it is “concerned at the fact that this breach was discovered on Tuesday and affects many millions of user accounts but Facebook is unable to clarify the nature of the breach and the risk for users at this point.”

A spokeswoman for Facebook said Sunday that the company will respond to follow-up questions from Ireland’s DPC and keep regulators apprised of further developments. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said Friday that the social network was taking the breach very seriously, and that it is still trying to determine many details around the scope and impact of the incident.

For Facebook, the breach is a significant blow to its efforts to regain trust after a series of privacy and security snafus that have riled users and lawmakers alike.

It marks one of the first significant tests of how regulators will apply the breach-notification and data-security provisions of the new European law, dubbed the General Data Protection Regulation, that went into effect earlier this year. It might also be a sign that the law’s threat of massive fines are already changing how firms handle big breaches—forcing them to disclose them faster and more publicly than before.

While there have been other recent breaches under GDPR—such as British Airways’ disclosure in early September that hackers had for more than two weeks intercepted financial details of clients who made bookings—few if any have been on the scale of Facebook’s breach, privacy lawyers say. The main question regulators will face is whether Facebook invested enough in security to avert a breach.

“When you talk about a business like Facebook that has huge resources and a large user base, that is inevitably going to be seen as a higher bar. The expectation should be that they are going to be deploying a very significant amount of resources” on security, said Andrew Dyson, a partner at DLA Piper.

Under GDPR, companies that don’t do enough to safeguard their users’ data risk a maximum fine of €20 million ($23 million), or 4% of a firm’s global annual revenue for the prior year, whichever is higher. Facebook’s maximum fine would be $1.63 billion using the larger calculation.

The law also requires companies to notify regulators of breaches within 72 hours, under threat of a maximum fine of 2% of world-wide revenue.

“The 72 hours is focusing everyone’s mind,” said a European privacy lawyer who works with big tech firms, but doesn’t represent Facebook.

The occurrence of a breach alone isn’t enough to merit a fine. While the new privacy law’s fines have yet to be tested, EU regulators often decline to issue the maximum possible fine in cases where a company has cooperated or been in at least partial compliance.

The Irish DPC said Facebook notified it of the breach on Thursday evening, which appears to fall within the law’s 72-hour time limit. The regulator complained that the notification “lacked detail,” but privacy lawyers said Sunday that it is common for a company to give an initial notification and then update regulators as they learn more about a breach. A spokesman for the DPC declined to elaborate on his statement until Facebook had replied to the regulator’s questions.

Any EU investigation into the breach will likely center on whether Facebook took appropriate steps to safeguard its users’ data before the hack. But given the newness of the GDPR, what counts as appropriate has yet to be defined by courts.

Facebook, for example, can argue that it invests heavily in security staff and technology and has boosted those expenditures recently. But the EU law recommends companies reduce the risk of breaches by minimizing the amount of user data they collect and keep. That could make any business that, like Facebook, relies heavily on data collection face tougher scrutiny, lawyers say.

“If you are a company that is processing personal data on a large scale, the level of risk is going to be seen as higher, so the level of security will have to be higher,” said Sarah Pearce, who heads the European data-privacy and cybersecurity practice at law firm Paul Hastings, adding that her comments don’t specifically relate to Facebook.

The breach probe in Ireland is the latest legal threat Facebook is facing from U.S. and European officials over its handling of user data.

In September, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg appeared in front of U.S. lawmakers to respond to questions about the company’s business and privacy practices.

Last week, the European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, demanded Facebook better spell out to consumers how their data is being used or face consumer-protection sanctions in several countries.

Separately, the company also has come under fire from privacy activists who have lodged complaints under the GDPR in several countries, arguing in part that Facebook requires users to agree to its terms of service—including the collection of their personal data—in order to use the social network.

Privacy activists argue that users aren’t freely giving their consent to the terms. Facebook counters that data it collects is necessary to fulfill its contract with users to provide “a personalized experience”—and contractual necessity is also a permitted justification under GDPR. Ireland’s data-protection regulator says it is investigating the issue.

In Germany, the national antitrust regulator last December issued a preliminary finding that Facebook abuses its position as the dominant social network in Germany to strong-arm users into allowing it to collect data about them from third-party sources, such as websites with “like” buttons.

Mi-au povestit ai mei mai tarziu cum statea treaba, insa la anumite batai luate de el de la mama adoptiva am asistat si eu. Si ce sa vezi, si familia respectiva era alcatuita dintre un barbat si o femeie. In concluzie, bazandu-ti ""adevarul"" pe premiza ca doar un barbat si o femeie pot avea grija corespunzator de un copil din centrele de plasament, lasand impresia ca doua persoane de acelasi sex nu pot avea grija de un copil, e fals.

Faptul ca se modifica programele media sa adopte noua idee e o prostie in sine, pentru ca tot ce exista acum in media e conceput pentru rating. Normal ca vor adopta noile idei, dar asta nu-ti va transforma copilul dintr-o orientare sexuala in alta, ci il va invata sa accepte orientarea sexuala a celor din jur.

BRR might not be perfect at the moment but its working incredibly well for an early access title, it does not cost much relative to other titles with the same potential playtime (i know this is always relative to your financial possibilities, thats why I set it in relation to other games) and an F2P model can still come up at release (and if I get it right thats a potential plan?)   


we are practically paying for playing it early and as a supportive act for a small player in the big pod. EA won't attract many, F2P will probably  attract more but player skill will level too. with the current playerbase it's possible to always get into a game within 1-2 minutes (including prep phase, at least in EU) and the game works perfectly fine, no crashes, rarely any bugs, etc.  
there is room to improvement but that needs time and money thus I fully understand the decisions that have been made by the team. they still have a business to run and other than some big ass companies they do it by offering good games, intense support, open communication (above post is very open, you won't read such a statement from many development companies) and a rather good price and absolutely zero pay to win.

&gt;That comment, made in August by Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative party leader and prominent Brexit supporter, caused bafflement in the City.

&gt;As the UK enters its final six months as a member of the EU, turmoil in the financial markets has been notable by its absence.

&gt;After sterling’s initial plunge in the hours after the Brexit vote in June 2016, it has traded in a broad band of $1.25 to $1.40. Meanwhile, gilt yields have edged higher and, in local currency terms, the stock market is up almost 20 per cent. Indeed, the economy has performed well enough for the Bank of England to raise interest rates twice.

&gt;It is a picture that leaves investors and politicians in a stand-off.

&gt;The calm in markets largely rests on the assumption that politicians will, in the end, reach a deal that avoids the UK crashing out of the EU at the end of March — but many politicians say that the likelihood would be enhanced if investors showed more pronounced signs of concern.

&gt;With ministers in Birmingham this week for the Conservative party’s annual conference, there is little sign of the government’s Brexit strategy changing.

&gt;“For Remainers the biggest problem has always been that the costs associated with Brexit only become clear once you’ve left, hence they’re looking to markets to front-load those costs, preferably by dumping UK assets across the board,” said Richard Mylles, a political analyst at City firm Absolute Strategy Research.

&gt;It is a view echoed by some in Westminster.

&gt;“The only way we can take the controls on this is if the public start to freak out about the consequences of a hard Brexit or crashing out with no deal, and the main thing that’s likely to get their attention is a market crisis,” said one Remain-supporting Conservative MP.

&gt;Markets, however, are unlikely to deliver a day or two of meltdown, Mr Mylles warned. 

&gt;“You probably want a real hammer blow from markets to change the political weather but the reaction probably will not come all at once,” he said. “We will need to see failure at various summits and events in October, November and December. The decline [in sterling] could stretch over months.”

&gt;Indeed, conditions in the financial markets have so far been a welcome relief for Brexit supporters. One leading Tory Brexiter said investors were “sanguine”.

&gt;“Most sensible people still have an expectation of a deal, and if there isn’t a deal they might be surprised but will that lead to mass panic? Probably not,” he said. “There may be a blip for a week or two but nothing longer-lasting. I can’t see there being a sell-off in any shape or form, most of the risks are priced in already.”

&gt;It would be wrong to suggest investors are relaxed about the political impasse over Brexit, but they are a long way from panic.

&gt;“The messaging about delays at customs and a possible sterling crisis is starting to feed through,” said Jeremy Thomson-Cook, head of currency strategy at WorldFirst. But for foreign exchange markets that can be swung around multiple times a day by political headlines, the March 29 deadline still feels distant: “Six months is not long in politics, but in currency markets it’s a lifetime.”

&gt;It is a perspective that helps investors draw three conclusions. 

&gt;First, any deal between the UK and the EU will be hatched at the last minute — so there is no reason to trade on the outcome now. Trying to predict the outcome of talks is pointless, investors say, partly because they are used to the EU cutting deals at the eleventh hour.

&gt;Valentijn van Niewenhuijzen, chief investment officer of NN Investment Partners, said that if Brexit resembled a game of chicken in politics, it is also “a game of chicken within the market itself”.

&gt;The base case is that an exit deal will be achieved. Failure is “the exception to the rule”, said Mr van Niewenhuijzen and, while Brexit could turn out to be the exception, the likelihood points to a deal even if there is political noise right up until the deadline.

&gt;But so long as the possibility of no deal remains, investors need to build it into their considerations. Analysts trying to model the various Brexit scenarios offer a sterling range as wide as $1.10 (no deal) to $1.50 (deal).

&gt;The second conclusion is that political noise over Brexit is far outweighed by other concerns. “Brexit is a long way down the list of things I worry about,” said Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments.

&gt;Instead he prioritises the hegemonic struggle between the US and China, trade tensions, the US midterm elections, the end of quantitative easing and the timing of a US economic slowdown.

&gt;Thirdly, some investors think the implications of Brexit on the economy can be overstated.

&gt;Businesses are holding back until they know a deal has been reached, said James Kwok, head of currency management at asset manager Amundi, “but they are not firing people, people are keeping their jobs”.

&gt;While the UK economy is lagging behind its G10 partners, it is still growing, expanding 0.4 per cent in the second quarter, the Office for National Statistics confirmed last week. .

&gt;That helps explain why, for many investors, a sharp sell-off looks, for the moment, unlikely — and the drift towards Brexit looks unstoppable.

&gt;“If politicians don’t see that effect on financial markets or the real economy, then they won’t change their mind,” said Robert Bergqvist, chief economist at SEB.

Tal como quando dizes que nunca ouviste chamar país irmão a Cabo Verde, ou que a relação entre UK - Nigéria está ao nível de Portugal - Angola, ou que um Vietnamita se integra melhor que um Angolano em Portugal. Etc. 

Aqui o mais preocupante nem estas frases serem ignorantes, nem sequer o seu nível de absurdo e fantasia. O preocupante é ser um português a dizer isto. É anormal um português ter este tipo de ignorância sobre África, dadas as nossas ligações sempre presentes. Isto é como achar um puto de 16 anos que não sabe como se faz um filho. Não espanta só a ignorância. A questão que se coloca é como é que alguém chega a essa idade sem saber. Só dá para imaginar uma vida toda fodida. Que vive fechado no quarto, ou num culto qualquer.

E isto é a mesma coisa. E não digo isto para ofender, pelo contrário. É a unica coisa que me levou a tentar ser respeitoso e dar alguma conversa. É que eu honestamente só compreender este nível de ignorância atroz, de alguém que vive em Portugal, se tiver uma vida toda fodida. E o que me parece é que tende a ser gente, que vive numa bolha de amigos delinquentes e de merdas de internet como os tais vídeos de fachizóides europeus que referi. E nessa bolha de culto retardado não sabe o básico do mundo que o rodeia. 

Fico por aqui que já dei conversa demais.

Im. Not sure how you think that means that it encompasses all linguistic families. 

While these facts are true what is also true is that sanskritham is a member of the Indo-European linguistic family.

Why get so insecure mate?

Let us say I am Tamil, does that change the veracity of my statement? 


&gt;Its not like anyone knows sanskrit already. Everyone would be learning sanskrit from the start. even hindi people. It would be equal for all. Sanskrit is already as perfect a language can be. No need to create another one while we already have the perfect thing.


What people. Know or. Not know is irrelevant.  
Policy change can accommodate for that and initial. Difficulties are not a good argument or any argument at all for a good idea.  

You keep saying sanskritham. Is perfect for that but again, it is not representative of the rich multi cultural and lingual heritage of India.  

Sanskritham is great that's why I said kanmada/telugu which preserve, incorporate sanskritham over 50%.

&gt;Larry Franklin was guilty of giving classified documents to the Israeli government. Your own slate link above opens with this.

Red herring nothing to do with accusing Feith and others of dual loyalties 

Franklin also describes that his motivation wasn’t israel loyalty it was [fighting antisemitism](https://forward.com/news/108778/once-labeled-an-aipac-spy-larry-franklin-tells-his/) he faced in the Intel community like people often insulting Jews and trying to keep lists of them 

His goal had nothing to do with Israel loyalty and he was actually concerned with saving us lives by forcing the us and Israel to coordinate on Iran policy to save soldiers in Iraq

https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jul/29/former-double-agent-says-fbi-turned-on-him/

So you’re proving my point lol by assuming dual loyalties

&gt;Cole said that neocon Doug Feith (who made it very public his desire to move US foreign policy to match Likud’s) was putting US interests below that of Likud. That’s a fair criticism against Feith himself.

This is like saying it’s ok to call African Americans monkeys if you think that some actually look like them

No dude it’s not ok

Feith has never said he’d prioritize Israel over the us

Or Likud

You’re wrong

&gt; It’s not a slam on Jews nor did he ever indicate any other Jewish politicians.

He only ever accuses Jewish politicians of this

Feith is one

In his defense of the Feith accusation he said that others exist without names

He posits Jewish influence on elections that doesn’t and didn’t exist saying

&gt; Apparently [President Bush] has fallen for a line from the neo-cons in his administration that they can deliver the Jewish vote to him in 2004 if only he kisses Sharon's [butt.]

He also named David Wurmser and indirectly referred to Wolfstein and others https://www.meforum.org/articles/2005/juan-cole-and-the-decline-of-middle-eastern-studie

He claimed the US is fighting as Israel’s proxy and Israel is running the show through “pro-Likud” officials 

He is antisemitic according to the EU and US definition

I gave you a long list of more and you ignored it all

Dude dogwhistles more than a dog trainer

&gt;Your links are to rightwing sources. Daniel Pipes is an extremist Islamophobe and he runs both the Campus Watch and meforum sites. All you’re doing is presenting a slanted series of opinion pieces and trying to pass them off as fact. It seems you want to defend Likud, well you can do so without having to make ad hominem attacks. 

If you can’t answer the source then you’re gonna have issues

Ad hominem for them literally quoting him is insufficient

It seems like you think it’s ad hominem to directly explain his views and quote him but not a problem to attack sources that quote him as though quotes have bias lol

It seems you want to defend antisemitism, well you can do so without having to make ad hominem attacks without answering the substance

&gt;And lastly, you’re wrong about professor Cole, and just because you disagree with him you’re trying to look for a way to dismiss him by impugning his work. He’s been disliked by neocons ever since 2002, but the difference is his work has been proven right by history and his analysis of Iraq pre-invasion has been right all along. 

He’s been disliked by everyone since 2002

That’s why his professorship at Yale was overruled

That’s why other historians show he’s made antisemitic comments before: (reproduced from the new republic) http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/1945

His work is not right lol

He’s a broken clock who got Iraq “right” by chance because he said Iraq having WMDs wasn’t so bad if it happened since they wouldn’t hit us soil lol

Since then he has:

* Wrongly claimed Iran never gave weapons to terrorists in Iraq and Afghanistan which we know is false

* Predicted israel would expel all West Bank Palestinians to Jordan and annex southern Lebanon which has not happened 

* claimed Israel’s security fence (which practically ended suicide bombing in israel) would increase terrorism in israel, which it didn’t

* claimed 9/11 was motivated by Ariel Sharon visiting the Temple Mount in 2000, when 9/11 was planned in 1999. Also claimed it was in response to the battle in Jenin that happened a year AFTER 9/11

* claimed without evidence that a journalist was killed in Iraq bc of an affair with his interpreter that didn’t happen and bc of “Mediterranean” culture (Iraq isn’t Mediterranean)

List goes on and on dude

&gt; 2. Agora encomendem o mesmo laudo ao mesmo psiquiatra em relação ao José Dirceu.
&gt; 3. UÉ! Não haverá contraprova, a PF colheu depoimento de um cara maluco?
&gt; 4. Laudos, atestados, etc…… podem ser comprados fácil nas praças do centro de São Paulo por exemplo.
&gt; 5. É de cair o cu da bunda msm…
&gt; 6. Um matador insano é tudo que se quer. Tudo que ele falar não pode ser levado em conta. É manicômio é muito melhor que prisão. Simples assim! Coisa de assassino em série no comando.
&gt; 7. De fato, ser esquerdista é uma insanidade mental.
&gt; 8. Por que será que não estamos nem um pouco surpresos com a “loucura” do psolento?!
&gt; 9. Como rola dinheiro e o pior é que é nosso dinheiro que foi roubado! Os petralhas estão azeitando todo mundo!
&gt; 10. O psiquiatrico disse que fez o trabalho de “graca”, isto porque ele ja devia ter recebido dinheiro atraves de laranjas. Tantos os advogados quando este psiquiatrico devem ser investigados pela PF.
&gt; 11. Tem que exigir um laudo isento de dúvidas. Feito por um profissional não da defesa.
&gt; 12. Entendi. Caso ele resolvesse falar o mandante… não aceitam porque ele foi considerado um louco! Safados!
&gt; 13. Surpresa!!!! Existe alguém que seja mentalmente são e tente matar outra pessoa deliberadamente?
&gt; 14. Deveriam fazer um teste psiquiátrico naqueles que boicotam o Bolso, mas fazem parte da sua coalizão!
&gt; 15. \#haddadopiorprefeitodobrasil
&gt; 16. E os documentos apresentados para participar da escola de tiro? Quem assinou o laudo, ou não é exigido?
&gt; 17. Então o povo brasileiro precisa ser internado. Está louco de raiva do PT.
&gt; 18. Quem indicou esse psiquiatra às pressas mesmo hein? Ah sim, foi essa defesa obscura. Tá certo.
&gt; 19. Prisão Nunca Mais!!!!
&gt; 20. Tá bom! Agora vamos fazer o mesmo exame usando um psiquiatra não petralha!!!
&gt; 21. Insanidade dele e de mais da metade de eleitores do Bozo.😂 Ora, tenha paciência!
&gt; 22. PORR….Esta historia foi prevista e revista………nos Estados Unidos era cara tinha sido mortinho na hora do atentado louco ou não …..aqui os “”guardas” do Bolsonaro nem souberam evitar ao at
&gt; 23. Afinal, quem esta pagando a defesa, laudos particulares, e todo este circo
&gt; 24. Alguém duvidava da terra,taí a resposta.O BRASIL entregue ao q existe de pior no mundo não duvido q seja até pior q no inferno até parece q o rei do inferno está aqui em pessoa comandando tudo.
&gt; 25. Com apenas 1 laudo e do médico indicado pelos advogados de bandidos????? Sério? Bolsonaro 1º turno e bandidos na cadeia 2019
&gt; 26. Deveriam é prender junto esse bandido desse psiquiatra.
&gt; 27. Desde quando uma laudo encomendado por uma pessoa lhe é desfavorável?, somos um país da piada pronta.
&gt; 28. KKKkkkkkkkkkk! Claro que vão alegar isso! Agora eu gostaria de saber quem está pagando esses advogados?! #ptnão!
&gt; 29. O esfaqueador de Bolsonaro é um doente mental que agiu sozinho.
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt;   1. Cidadão é um doente mental!
&gt; 30. Amarrar o cabrito no pé de couve dá resultados óbvios. Juiz que aceitar isso…
&gt; 31. Já era de se esperar. E se entregar algm, o loco estaria comprovado. Essa esquerda maldita e corruptos tem q serem exterminados da política e do Brasil já….=====&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Vote dia 7=&gt;em 17
&gt; 32. Qualquer filiado do PSOL tem insanidade mental, qual é a novidade? Avante Capitão Bolsonaro 17.
&gt; 33. Grande novidade, o planejamento está correndo como esperado pela Orcrim. Mas não existe crime perfeito.
&gt; 34. É evidente que o laudo será contestado e aspirante à assassino passará por outras avaliações beeeeeem mais isentas.
&gt; 35. Ahahahahahahah, adélio é insano. Insano é o idiota que acredita em um documento guiado pela defesa do bandido. Aliás, como andam as investigações sobre os honorários da defesa desse marginal?
&gt; 36. Que surpresa.
&gt; 37. Porque não estamos surpresos? Um médico comprado… um laudo comprado, será que ele não quer um atestado tambem?
&gt; 38. Quanto custou.
&gt; 39. Que novidade, alguém duvidava de que o resultado seria esse? Matá-lo num hospício será mais fácil…
&gt; 40. Kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk . . . e o juiz vai aceitar . . . kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk . . .
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt;   1. ??????????????? No Brasil hoje tudo é ????????????
&gt; 41. Que conveniente.
&gt; 42. Novidade!
&gt; 43. Esse laudo merece a mesma credibilidade que tem a mídia esquerdopata e o partido/organização criminosa. O lema é: “se não tem verdade a gente inventa”.
&gt; 44. A Justiça vai aceitar isso numa boa? não vai querer contra prova? Só neste País mesmo!! Isto aqui já está virando uma Venezuela!! Que absurdo!!
&gt; 45. kkkkkkkkkkk alguém esperava algo diferente dos adevogados (sic) do criminoso ?!?!
&gt; 46. Mesmo???? Encomendado pela defesa???? Entendi…
&gt; 47. kkkkkkkkkkk eles julgam e decidem … ah cade quem pode ajudar o povo brasileiroo com essa discrepancia cade???????????????????????????????????????
&gt; 48. kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
&gt; 49. É claro, o coitadinho louco que tentou matar uma pessoa. Chamem agora um psiquiatra sério para fazer o laudo.

Jews are responsible.

Over the past 100 years they have been slowly, methodically manipulating the social order to sow chaos

It's my firm belief that Jews are responsibile for the vitriol being thrown around concerning [men vs. women,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Feminists_by_religion) [republican vs. democrat,] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoconservatism#History) [whites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Defamation_League#Origin) [vs. blacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Frank)

They use cryptojewery to create, disperse, and to spread disinformation and whip people of European descent into a frenzy over whatever page/group/issue they're subscribed to on Facebook, mass media/Hollywood, etc. It's simple divide and conquer. 

The sudden surge of incest porn is exactly the same. [Jewish moguls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Goldstein) created the hardcore pornography industry and are now flooding the market with the last great sexual taboo in an effort to normalize the behavior, which overall will have a detrimental effect on the fabric of American society. America didn't wake up one morning in mid 2017 and say, ""You know what my life has been seriously lacking? A whole bunch of incest porn."" That had to come from [somewhere,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Lansky) right?

While I can't specifically point out an A+B=C endgame to this, I think we can all agree that the normalization of this taboo has much more significant consequences than say, thinking of tentacle porn as ""normal.""

Why? You ask?

Because destabilizing the West in this fashion is both funny and profitable to them. There's a room full of fat Jewish media moguls drinking Manischewitz cocktails and eating reubens who are fucking laughing at us right now over how easily the goyim are influenced and subverted. And they've always been involved in your porn. 

Just a working theory. 

-----------------------------------------------------

Was genau empfandest du da als schwer?   
Ich bin da schon früh drauf gekommen durch irgendeinen Kommentar hier auf reddit und das was mir am schwersten fiel, war nicht gleich wegzulaufen aber mir war schon klar, dass ich damit bald in der Familie konfrontiert werde. Am Ende hat doch jeder seinen eigenen Blödsinn aus den Nachrichten gelesen und alle haben parallel in eine einzige Richtung gegackert.  
Da gab es dann auch schon relativ schnell gute externe und interne Zusammenfassungen (siehe den wiki). 

&gt; Bei politischen Verschwörungstheorieen hat man da leider ein wenig von dem Spaßfaktor verloren, und geht gleich sehr in die Überzeugung was richtig und was falsch ist. Das führt sehr schnell zu unüberbrückbaren Differenzen. 

Das liegt daran, dass heute Verschwörungstheoretiker an der Macht sind und die diese Theorien als Fakten verkaufen um ihre Politik zu rechtfertigen. Ich verstehe nicht warum du dir da Spaß dabei wünschst. Das ist kein Spaß für die Leute die die Opfer dieser Theorien werden. Das war es noch nie. Tatsächlich ist es auch kein Spaß für die Verschwörungstheoretiker (sofern sie sich nicht nur als solche ausgeben und in Wirklichkeit die o.g. Geschäftsleute sind). Diese Leute leiden. Sie merken es dabei oft nicht einmal aber wenn man sich von Gefahren umzingelt vorfindet, ist das kein gesunder Zustand. Es bringt da auch nichts sich vorzumachen, dass man ja jetzt mit Wissen gesegnet sei die der Rest nicht hat. Dieses Wissen ist ja Teil der Bedrohungsphantasie. 

&gt; Mein Rat für den persönlichen Kreis: Nicht sofort alles als Blödsinn abtun.

Wie schon geschrieben: ich habe inzwischen diverse Versammlungen besucht deswegen. Ich bin inzwischen ein Profi in westlicher Mystik. Da nehme es locker mir dem amorc Meister von nebenan auf. Das Problem ist auch so ein auf und ab. Es geht manchmal sogar einige Jahre gut bis ein Rückfall kommt. Die Popularität von Verschwörungstheorien derzeit führt jedoch dazu, dass so mancher wieder in den Rückfall geradezu getrieben wird weil er eben so viel Bestätigung findet. Das ist eine fatale Entwicklung und eine Krankheit der Gesellschaft. Ich sage das mit Absicht so drastisch weil diese Szenen keinerlei positiven Mehrwert mitbringen für die Betroffenen. Sie verursachen finanzielle, seelische und geistige Schäden an Individuen die inkompatibel werden mit einem (immer noch) Großteil der Gesellschaft. Das einzige was es fördert ist die Kreativität in der Rechtfertigung... 

Deswegen kann ich deinen Stolz und deinen Spaß hier nicht nachempfinden. Es trägt ebenfalls weiter dazu bei, dass sich Leute in diesem Verhalten bestätigt fühlen und ihren Scham ausblenden. Das ist keine gute Entwicklung.

&gt; The Kissaway Trail (formerly known as Isles or as Hostmom) are an underground indie/artrock band from Odense, Denmark.
The band has five members: 
Thomas L. Fagerlund  - Vocals, Guitar
Søren B. Corneliussen  - Vocals, Guitar
Daniel Skjoldmose  - Guitar, Keys, Backing Vocals
Rune Pedersen  - Bass, Backing vocals
Hasse Mydtskov  - Drums, Backing vocals

&gt; Their sound is quite similar to some other Danish bands, such as The Figurines, Moi Caprice and Mew. Internationally, comparisons can be made to Modest Mouse, Mercury Rev, Arcade Fire and the Flaming Lips.

&gt; Three members of The Kissaway Trail (Søren, Thomas and Rune) originally recorded together under the names of ‘Hostmom’ and ‘Isles’. Isles self-released an album called ""We have decided not to die"" in 2005. Since then, an additional guitarist, Daniel, and drummer Hasse joined the band, while Thomas started to sing alongside Søren making the distinctive two lead-vocal sound that they have today. Various tracks from this early period of the bands history can still be downloaded from Danish music websites. The band’s musical existence very nearly ended when Søren lost his love for music after his father was killed under tragic circumstances. However, he made his own decision to start performing and recording again, and The Kissaway Trail started to create their debut album.

&gt; Their material is released in Europe (aside from Scandinavia) and Japan by Bella Union, Etch n Sketch in Australia and New Zealand, and Playground Music in Scandinavia. On their breakthrough album underground producer Morten Frank helped them in the studio.

&gt; The title of their song 61 relates to the number of days a band member had to wait to hear if their family member had a terminal illness. The member involved is kept under wraps, obviously for very personal reasons; some fans believe it is Hasse, the drummer, because he has a tattoo of the number '61' on his chest. Other sources suggest he just might have got the tattoo because, according to his own admission, 61 is his favourite song to play live.

&gt; In the Autumn of 2007, The Kissaway Trail acted as the main support for Editors on their UK and European tours, alongside Ra Ra Riot in the UK and The Boxer Rebellion in Europe.

&gt; The Kissaway Trail are renowned for their own individual slant on the English language within their lyrics.

&gt; The band have cited influences to their music include The Beach Boys, Granddaddy, Daniel Johnston and Sonic Youth, amongst others. The lack of an obvious way to describe their music has brought common comparisons between themselves and the Polyphonic Spree and Canadian band the Arcade Fire. There is some truth with these similarities.

&gt; The band have been known for their live performances, which have included songs from 'The Kissaway Trail', as well as b-sides such as 'Romeo And Romeo' and 'La Mia'. They have also performed at the Wireless, Latitude and SXSW festivals in 2007, and the Montreaux Jazz Festival in 2008, where they supported Interpol and The National.

&gt; The band released an EP called ""Into the Ocean and Rise Again"" in 2006, and their debut album called ""The Kissaway Trail"" was released in 2007 from which 3 singles have been taken to date (Smother + Evil = Hurt, La La Song &amp; 61 Read more on Last.fm.

Rope: Dynamic line would indeed be more forgiving for slips and also make it less possible for the branch holding me to break on those slips I assume. But would it also make ascending with different methods more energy consuming as I'd be bouncing more on it and had to take out the slag every time I put my weight on it? I guess there is some optimal elongation range for tree climbing ropes? Any idea at which range it might be if I were to look for a less stretchy climbing rope? Yale and Samson, two brands mentioned here I can't find from EU retailers and won't pay $70 on shipping + 21% for taxes by ordering from US :P I will most likely use [www.addnature.co.uk](https://www.addnature.co.uk/) or [https://www.bergfreunde.eu/](https://www.bergfreunde.eu/) but open for suggestions of other Europe based shops too if someone happens to know a better store. Nearly 12mm would pretty much kill the lightweight aspect, but I guess I am willing to make a sacrifice on that for now. Just optimal diameter/materials/stretch/knotability for Blakes and footlocking ascends is fine for now.

&amp;#x200B;

Throwline: I guess I'll try out fishing line setup first (I am that stubborn) on my own property just in case if I tangle it real good and eventually choke some branch to death. If it doesn't work my lab will borrow me one of his dummies and I should have some more suitable line laying around somewhere too. Or maybe I'll sacrifice one of my socks I don't know.

É preciso dimensionar sim. O esquema Lava-Jato do PT/PP/PR/PMDB desviou dois orçamentos anuais da educação básica em 10 anos.

Não sou coordenador de campanha e posso estar enganado. Mas me parece que isolar Lula, Dirceu, Palocci e Genoíno era a forma ideal do PT vencer essas eleições.

Terminei de assistir. Achei o começo meio fraco, mas a série evoluiu bem, com o 9° episódio sendo o melhor na minha opinião. Porém achei o plot twist muito ruim. Final que não resolve nada e só serve pra mostrar que terá uma nova temporada.

**Peaky Blinders**

Série que mostra a história da gangue Peaky Blinders, de Birmingham, Inglaterra (delícia de sotaque), liderada por Thomas Shelby (Cillian Murphy). A história se passa logo após a 1ª guerra, que os personagens participaram. A série explora bem como a guerra afetou a galera. Chega a ser engraçado pois o Inspetor que está tentando pegar os Peaky Blinders não lutou na guerra e ninguém perde a oportunidade de jogar isso na cara dele.

Estou acho que na metade da 1a temporada e não lembro de ter gostado de uma série tão rápido como essa. Na metade do 1o episódio eu já estava adorando os personagens e o feeling da série. Estou escrevendo uma história que os personagens principais são criminosos e assistir Peaky Blinders tem sido bastante inspirador.

**Pantera Negra**

Que filme chato e previsível, puta merda. O chamariz dele é a parte visual e mesmo nisso falha. Tem partes interessantes, mas tem uns CGs mais feios que bater na mãe por causa de mistura. Na parte de perseguição de carros na Coréia, quando o carro que as 2 mulheres estão explode e um monte de peça sem textura voa na sua cara que por favor né, arruma isso aí. No quesito efeitos especiais acho que Dr Estranho foi o melhor da Marvel.

No final do filme, quando os 2 malandro tão lutando na linha do trem, que foi explicado antes que tinha uma parada que desativa o vibranium completamente, não funciona 100% na roupa deles porque alguém quis assim e ficou aquele efeito sem graça de roupa aparecendo/desaparecendo em meia dúzia de lugares.

###Transexuality does not exist

This is false. As per homosexuality, research has shown marked differences between transgender individuals and individuals of their assigned sex, pointing at neurobiological underpinnings for gender dysphoria. Some draw parallels between dysphoria and eating disorders, but those are superficial at best.

Bandini, E., Fisher, A. D., Castellini, G., Lo Sauro, C., Lelli, L., Meriggiola, M. C., ..., &amp; Ricca, V. (2013, April). Gender Identity Disorder and Eating Disorders: Similarities and Differences in Terms of Body Uneasiness. https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jsm.12062

    GID and eating disorders are characterized by a severe body uneasiness, which represents the core of distress in both conditions. Different dimensions of body uneasiness seem to be involved in GID subsamples, depending on reassignment stage and genotypic sex. In eating disorder subjects body uneasiness is primarily linked to general psychopathology, whereas in GID such a relationship is lacking.

Berglund, H., Lindström, P., Dhejne-Helmy, C., &amp; Savic, I. (2008, August). Male-to-Female Transsexuals Show Sex-Atypical Hypothalamus Activation When Smelling Odorous Steroids. https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhm216

    One working hypothesis behind transsexuality is that the normal sex differentiation of certain hypothalamic networks is altered. We tested this hypothesis by investigating the pattern of cerebral activation in 12 nonhomosexual male-to-female transsexuals (MFTRs) when smelling 4,16-androstadien-3-one (AND) and estra-1,3,5(10),16-tetraen-3-ol (EST). These steroids are reported to activate the hypothalamic networks in a sex-differentiated way. Like in female controls the hypothalamus in MFTRs activated with AND, whereas smelling of EST engaged the amygdala and piriform cortex. Male controls, on the other hand, activated the hypothalamus with EST. However, when restricting the volume of interest to the hypothalamus activation was detected in MFTR also with EST, and explorative conjunctional analysis revealed that MFTR shared a hypothalamic cluster with women when smelling AND, and with men when smelling EST. Because the EST effect was limited, MFTR differed significantly only from male controls, and only for EST-AIR and EST-AND. These data suggest a pattern of activation away from the biological sex, occupying an intermediate position with predominantly female-like features. Because our MFTRs were nonhomosexual, the results are unlikely to be an effect of sexual practice. Instead, the data implicate that transsexuality may be associated with sex-atypical physiological responses in specific hypothalamic circuits, possibly as a consequence of a variant neuronal differentiation.

    It is still unclear to what extent cross-gender identity is due to pre- and perinatal organising effects of sex hormones on the brain. Empirical evidence for a relationship between prenatal hormonal influences and certain aspects of gender typical (cognitive) functioning comes from pre- and postpubertal clinical samples, such as women suffering from congenital adrenal hyperplasia and studies in normal children. In order to further investigate the hypothesis that cross-gender identity is influenced by prenatal exposure to (atypical) sex steroid levels we conducted a study with early onset, adult, male-to-female and female-to-male transsexuals, who were not yet hormonally treated, and nontranssexual adult female and male controls. The aim of the study was to find out whether early onset transsexuals performed in congruence with their biological sex or their gender identity. The results on different tests show that gender differences were pronounced, and that the two transsexual groups occupied a position in between these two groups, thus showing a pattern of performance away from their biological sex. The findings provide evidence that organisational hormonal influences may have an effect on the development of cross-gender identity.

    Allele and genotype frequencies for the polymorphism XbaI were statistically significant only in FtM vs control XX subjects (P = .021 and P = .020). In XX individuals, the A/G genotype was associated with a low risk of gender dysphoria (odds ratio [OR] = 0.34; 95% CI = 0.16-0.74; P = .011); in XY individuals, the A/A genotype implied a low risk of gender dysphoria (OR = 0.39; 95% CI = 0.17-0.89; P = .008). Binary logistic regression showed partial effects for all three polymorphisms in FtM but not in MtF subjects. The three polymorphisms were in linkage disequilibrium: a small number of TA repeats was linked to the presence of PvuII and XbaI restriction sites (haplotype S-T-A), and a large number of TA repeats was linked to the absence of these restriction sites (haplotype L-C-G). In XX individuals, the presence of haplotype L-C-G carried a low risk of gender dysphoria (OR = 0.66; 95% CI = 0.44-0.99; P = .046), whereas the presence of haplotype L-C-A carried a high susceptibility to gender dysphoria (OR = 3.96; 95% CI = 1.04-15.02; P = .044). Global haplotype was associated with FtM gender dysphoria (P = .017) but not with MtF gender dysphoria.

    XbaI-rs9340799 is involved in FtM gender dysphoria in adults. Our findings suggest different genetic programs for gender dysphoria in men and women.

    Debate on the relative contributions of nature and nurture to an individual's gender patterns, sexual orientation and gender identity are reviewed as they appeared to this observer starting from the middle of the last century. Particular attention is given to the organization-activation theory in comparison to what might be called a theory of psychosexual neutrality at birth or rearing consistency theory. The organization-activation theory posits that the nervous system of a developing fetus responds to prenatal androgens so that, at a postnatal time, it will determine how sexual behavior is manifest. How organization-activation was or was not considered among different groups and under which circumstances it is considered is basically understood from the research and comments of different investigators and clinicians. The preponderance of evidence seems to indicate that the theory of organization-activation for the development of sexual behavior is certain for non-human mammals and almost certain for humans. This article also follows up on previous clinical critiques and recommendations and makes some new suggestions.

Garcia-Falgueras, A., &amp; Swaab, D. F. (2008, November). A sex difference in the hypothalamic uncinate nucleus: relationship to gender identity. https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/awn276

    Transsexuality is an individual's unshakable conviction of belonging to the opposite sex, resulting in a request for sex-reassignment surgery. We have shown previously that the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTc) is female in size and neuron number in male-to-female transsexual people. In the present study we investigated the hypothalamic uncinate nucleus, which is composed of two subnuclei, namely interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH) 3 and 4. Post-mortem brain material was used from 42 subjects: 14 control males, 11 control females, 11 male-to-female transsexual people, 1 female-to-male transsexual subject and 5 non-transsexual subjects who were castrated because of prostate cancer. To identify and delineate the nuclei and determine their volume and shape we used three different stainings throughout the nuclei in every 15th section, i.e. thionin, neuropeptide Y and synaptophysin, using an image analysis system. The most pronounced differences were found in the INAH3 subnucleus. Its volume in thionin sections was 1.9 times larger in control males than in females (P&lt; 0.013) and contained 2.3 times as many cells (P&lt; 0.002). We showed for the first time that INAH3 volume and number of neurons of male-to-female transsexual people is similar to that of control females. The female-to-male transsexual subject had an INAH3 volume and number of neurons within the male control range, even though the treatment with testosterone had been stopped three years before death. The castrated men had an INAH3 volume and neuron number that was intermediate between males (volume and number of neurons P&gt; 0.117) and females (volume P&gt; 0.245 and number of neurons P&gt; 0.341). There was no difference in INAH3 between pre-and post-menopausal women, either in the volume (P&gt; 0.84) or in the number of neurons (P&lt; 0.439), indicating that the feminization of the INAH3 of male-to-female transsexuals was not due to estrogen treatment.

False,netbeing,1502465651.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_8smjlz,,"China's export orders shrank in September as a tariff battle with Washington over technology escalated, adding to downward pressure on the world's No. 2 economy, two surveys showed Sunday.

The reports add to signs Chinese trade, which had held up despite U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff hikes, might be weakening. That adds to pressure on an economy that already was forecast to cool due to slowing global consumer demand and lending controls imposed to rein in a debt boom.

The official China Federation of Logistics &amp; Purchasing's monthly measure of new export orders fell to 48 from August's 49.4 on a 100-point scale on which numbers below 50 show activity shrinking.

A separate index by a business magazine, Caixin, showed new export orders fell at the fastest rate in more than two years. The magazine said companies blamed ""trade frictions"" and tariffs.

Overall, the federation's monthly purchasing managers index showed manufacturing activity decelerated to 50.8 from August's 51.3. Caixin said its index fell to 50 from 50.6.

""Downward pressure on China's economy was significant,"" economist Zhengsheng Zhong said in Caixin's report.

The resiliency of China's $12 trillion-a-year economy until now has allowed President Xi Jinping's government to reject pressure for changes in initiatives such as ""Made in China 2025"" that call for state-led creation of champions in robotics and other technologies.

Washington, Europe and other trading partners say those violate Beijing's market-opening obligations.

The International Monetary Fund and other forecasters expect this year's economic growth to fall to about 6.5 percent from 2017's 6.8 percent. But that slowdown is due mostly to the ruling Communist Party's long-term efforts to steer China to self-sustaining growth based on consumer spending instead of trade and investment.

Last week, Trump stepped up pressure by raising tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods. Beijing retaliated with penalties on $60 billion of American imports. Both sides already had raised duties on $50 billion of each other's goods.

The two sides have announced no plans for negotiations. China accused Trump in a report last week of bullying other countries. A deputy commerce minister said negotiations were impossible while Washington ""holds a knife"" of tariff hikes to Beijing's throat.

With no settlement in sight, forecasters say the conflict could trim global economic growth by 0.5 percent through 2020.

Sunday's reports gave no details on September orders from the United States, China's biggest national export market.

Sales to the United States have held up so far, rising by more than 13 percent in August. But analysts said that strength might have been due partly to Chinese suppliers rushing to beat increases in import taxes.

American officials complain Beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology. They worry Chinese technology initiatives might erode U.S. industrial leadership.

Communist leaders have tried to stick to long-term reform plans the ruling party says will make the state-dominated economy more competitive and productive.

Beijing has cut import tariffs and announced plans to open auto manufacturing and some other industries wider to foreign competitors. But none of their changes address the U.S. technology complaints.

Last week, Beijing announced tariff cuts, effective, Nov. 1, on 1,585 types of goods including construction equipment.

Chinese leaders should act quickly to ""expand domestic demand and resolve the short-term downward pressure,"" economist Zhang Liqun said in the logistics federation's report.

Trade's importance to China has shrunk but it still supports millions of well-paid jobs. The United States is the destination for the highest-value Chinese exports including smartphones, industrial machinery and medical technology.

The logistics federation's employment index fell 1.1 points to 48.3, indicating workforces were shrinking.

American chicken is more ""competitive"" because the whole chain from egg to plate is much more intensely gamed and dirty in the states. If you have a thousand birds in one cage crawling over each other and shitting on each other the chain as a whole is a lot cheaper than if you mandate by law that chickens need acceptable conditions. Those regulations will mean fewer birds per m2, and hence each bird will be more expensive.

&gt; The Rolling Stones are an English rock group that formed in London in 1962. First popular in Europe, they quickly became successful in North America during the ""British Invasion"" of the mid-60s. Since then, their worldwide sales are estimated at more than 200 million albums. In 1989, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and in 2004, they ranked number 4 in Rolling Stone magazine's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. In 2008, Billboard magazine ranked the Rolling Stones at number ten on ""The Billboard Hot 100 Top All-Time Artists"", and as the second most successful group in the Billboard Hot 100 chart.

&gt; The group was formed by Brian Jones, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Ian Stewart, who met as schoolmates in Dartford, Kent. They took their name from a Muddy Waters song called ""Rollin' Stone Blues"", and made their live debut at London's Marquee Club (minus Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts). They start playing pubs and clubs around the city and suburbs. Bill Wyman joined later that year (the popular story is that he was asked because he had his own amplifier).

&gt; In January 1963, Charlie Watts  joined the Stones. The band gigged constantly, with residencies at venues like Ealing Jazz Club, Ken Colyer's Studio 51, and Eel Pie Island in Twickenham.  Their weekly performances at the Crawdaddy at Richmond's Station Hotel resulted in ecstatic press reviews, and in April Andrew Loog Oldham saw them there and signed them to his management company the next day. He started the ""Would you let your daughter marry a Rolling Stone"" press campaign, which set the tone for their career.

&gt; In May 1963, the Stones were signed to Decca Records by the same man who had turned down the Beatles. A month later ""Come On"", the first Rolling Stones single, was released, and reached number two in the U.K. charts.

&gt; The fifth member of the group, Brian Jones, left on 8th June 1969, saying that he wanted to form a new group. He was replaced by Mick Taylor, formerly in John Mayall's Bluesbreakers.

&gt; In 1971 the Stones, whose contract with Decca had expired, launched their Rolling Stones Records label.  In December 1974 Taylor left the group in order to pursue a solo career.  He was replaced in 1975 by Ronnie Wood.

&gt; Since Wyman left the Stones in 1993, the band has consisted of Jagger, Richards, Watts and guitarist Ronnie Wood. In studio and live performances, Darryl Jones (bassist) and Chuck Leavell (keyboardist) also serve as a regular contributors. 

&gt; In 2005, the band released ""A Bigger Bang"". 

&gt; On December 2, 2016, the band released their first studio album in over 10 years, entitled ""Blue &amp; Lonesome"" (2016) on the Polydor label. 

&gt; All the members have also undertaken solo projects of various kinds. The end. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Milky Chance is a German alternative pop folk rock duo with reggae and electronic music influences made up of Clemens Rehbein as vocalist and musician and Philipp Dausch as DJ. Both originating from Kassel, they are signed to Kassel-based label Lichtdicht Records.

&gt; The duo finished their high school education at Jacob-Grimm-Schule. Clemens played in a jazz quartet known as Flown Tones where he played bass guitar. Philipp was a DJ. The duo worked in 2012 launching some materials online particularly ""Stolen Dance"" that attracted attention. In 2013, they released their self-produced album Sadnecessary that was well received, that included the tracks ""Stolen Dance"" and ""Down by the River"". Both the album and the debut single ""Stolen Dance"" have charted in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.
In May 2013, Milky Chance made a sold-out tour of Germany to promote the album and took part in a number of music festivals including Dockville Festival in Hamburg. They will embark on a European tour in 2014. Read more on Last.fm.

- BC is going to have to open grocery store wine sales to non-BC wines.  This to me makes sense as so far BC winemakers have overpriced their grocery wine sales, and therefore nothing has been selling.  Similarly, Quebec won't be allowed to enforce it's own bottling of wine sold in grocery stores.

- Exchange rate matters will largely remain the same.  Be market driven, IMF policy driven, and not used as an advantage over another.

- State-owned enterprises will not be able to offer anything over their private counterparts to ensure a larger consumer base.  What this means isn't clear, but the trend we've seen here is the privatization of telecoms and energy crown corporations.  That will likely continue imho.  The CBC will probably have to be looked at as well, as private media has complained about their online revenue in particular.  One thing that may protect the CBC is the 'cultural exemption', which I've heard about.  May also be an 'essential security' exemption, if definition stretched.

- No tariffs or any other fees for digital trade.  ie. No 'Netflix tax.'  And google/facebook will not encounter the trouble that they're having in the EU.

- USMCA does not cover water or other natural resources, unless they are being extracted for commercial use.  It doesn't obligate anyone to extract for commercial use either.  Pretty much a 'calm the public' letter there, as this has been a widely-spread fear about negotiations.

- Assurances that auto tariffs will not happen, but reviews based on capacity and demand can still happen.

- More access to Canadian markets for the US dairy industry.  Up from practically zero to ranges from 1.5% to 3.6%, looks like.  Will go up 1% every year for 13 years after the rapid gain phase is over, 7 years from now.

- If anything is in the interests of 'essential security', then it is exempt from USMCA (this is similar to what Trump called upon with regards to autos before - national security)

- A committee of governmental parties to ensure further integration of North American interests to establish further competitiveness of North American exports.  To me this is referring to energy more than anything, considering the current o&amp;g boom in the US.  We'll be doing our part as usual.

- Keeping our respective infrastructures in-line to promote small business growth.  Makes sense.

- Recognizes environmental concerns and indigenous ties to the environment.  Further recognizes that it is inappropriate to establish environmental laws to prohibit trade.  So what does this mean?  Well, it looks like industry has to take as many steps as required to facilitate a healthy environment, which is good for business anyway, but things like international pipelines will still be built.  This is fairly status quo.  Also, we're going to cooperate to take on more global issues like marine plastics, fishing sustainability, etc.

- Migrant workers are supposed to have more rights. imho This is being encouraged so they can send enough money home to significantly help with their own local economies.  Long-term this will benefit us in terms of trade as well.

- IP rights further entrenched.  Drugs, digital, etc.  Consumer costs will likely go up there, so either incomes have to as well, or costs elsewhere have to go down.

I sort of jumped in on the September accountability challenge, but I'm ALL IN for posting every day on October! I've been tracking calories with MFP since July 31, and am looking forward to hitting my 90 day streak in MFP this month. My goals for the month are: 

\-go to Dutch class twice a week and practice 3 more days on top of that per week with Duolingo (so, 5 days of Dutch practice per week total)

\-walk to the far grocery store instead of the closer one for daily groceries (I'm already 0/31 for this one, because it was pouring today)

\-post here once a day

\-hit my 10kg loss mini-goal 

\-apply for (at least) one job a week

October is my favorite month of the year, temperature and nature-wise, so I know this month is going to rock. One thing I was thinking about, when mulling over what I wanted my goals to be, was the question *What would I do if I woke up at my goal weight tomorrow?* And, my answer (as reflected in my goals above), was fearlessly apply to jobs. Back home in America, I never let being wildly under qualified stop me from trying. But here, on top of the language barrier, feeling too fat and decidedly un-European has got me really stuck. So, even while I can't apply for the job I used to have (American certifications are not valid here/I would require more school/it's complicated), I have started a list of other things I would like to try out. It would be amazing to actually GET one of the jobs I will apply for this month, but just the action of trying is good enough for me right now!

First year of college I (then 18, now 26) met a guy (then 19, now 27) and we fell for each other quickly. I did a study abroad program in London (a month long) a few months into our relationship. Absolutely loved it and found the LDR pretty manageable so I decided I wanted to try to get my masters in the UK as well. 

Talk to him about it, he seems surprised but overall pretty supportive in the initial conversation. Years pass and we got more serious, talking about marriage and our future together after Uni since he was a year ahead of me. 

He talked about us moving in together and saving for a wedding etc. I bring up that I wasn’t concerned about getting married any time soon and how my (now very serious) plans to live abroad for a year would probably take up a lot of my money anyways. 

He was floored, “Is that something you’re actually still thinking about, throwaway?” 

“Of course it is. I’ve wanted to do this for nearly 2 years now. I’ve been saving up as much as I can.” 

As it turns out, he had been supportive under the mindset that either we’d break up before it became an issue or that we’d be so serious that I’d feel the need to give up that dream to stay and marry him. He didn’t understand why I would even want to do it, “Aren’t you happy here with me?” 

He couldn’t understand that it wasn’t wanting to be away from him, or a reflection on our relationship. That conversation set the wheels in motion for me to do a lot of reflection, how any time we went on a trip together he was always picking at the flaws and talking about why our simple rural life was superior to the likes of NYC, etc. While I wanted nothing more than to leave my roots for a while and see what the world has to offer. 

How when I’d bring up traveling to Europe or Asia etc one day, he would just ask “What on earth made you start thinking about that?” And change the topic. How he brought up marriage more and more as I started looking into masters programs. 

The next 2-3 months after that, cracks that had been forming in our relationship (both related and unrelated to the issue at hand) started growing larger and larger. Being together was becoming exhausting for both of us. I was starting to see three years of my life slide down the drain. 

We talked a lot, about ourselves and our relationship. How things were going wrong and how to fix them. Any attempt was like slapping some duct tape on a burst pipe, it may have helped for a moment but ultimately it failed to address the problem that (for me at least) was becoming far more evident. We had incompatible versions of what we saw as a well lived life. 

I was in denial. I’d really hoped that I was wrong and it was just the stress of him trying to finish his last year in college and me mapping out exactly how to get from where I was to where I needed to be. 

Over spring break I used my financial aid refund money to book a flight over to the UK and do campus tours of some of my top schools. Boyfriend was adamantly against it which caused even more fighting. 

While I was so far away, wrapped up in traveling around the country looking at schools from Brighton to Glasgow... a realization hit me like a ton of bricks. I didn’t miss him. At all. It was a weird relief to not be expected to talk to him. The more he messaged me, the less I wanted to respond. 

Halfway through my trip, I was on a tour of the University of York. Part of their tour at the time was to break groups up into smaller clusters by department to speak with current students and get a more personalized feel for the campus and department of interest. 

As I was the only person that seemed to be interested in political science/communication out of that particular group, this led to me being one on one with the chosen student from that department who was available that day. A strikingly handsome man who was just a couple of years older than myself. 

He was very helpful and informative, and as time went on the conversation drifted away from the school into ourselves and our interests, why I was looking at a school so far away etc. He talked about his travels and I mine, our general interests and all that and we wound up having a load in common. We went well over the 45 minutes that was expected of a tour and got a coffee together at his favorite place on campus. 

He knew I had a boyfriend and the whole interaction was PG, but I definitely felt a spark between us. When we did split up, he gave me his email address and asked me to shoot him an email if I decided to go to that uni and had any questions or concerns. I almost ditched it, but in the end I decided to keep it. It could come in handy, right? 

That was the last push I needed. I realized that my love for him had faded away and that we weren’t meant to spend our lives together. It was a weirdly peaceful moment for me. For him however,  absence seemed to make the heart grow fonder. The night I got back, he proposed to me. 

He said he knew we didn’t have money for a big wedding. But that we could go down to the court house and tie the knot quickly and save to have the actual ceremony later. That is being married would help him feel better about the year apart because it showed we were committed. 

If I hadn’t already decided to break up with him, I would have then. He had admitted to me that he didn’t trust me at my word, but felt the need to legally bind us together to be okay with the distance. It felt like he was less concerned about marriage as a step in our journey together, and was more worried about “locking me down”. 

I turned down his proposal and we broke up. It was very messy and there was a lot of fighting involved as he demanded to know why I was “dumping him out of the blue”. Even after I explained what I had been thinking and feeling, he just deflected with “I wish you’d talked to me” (I did) and “When a relationship is broken you fix it, you don’t throw it away” (Things can only be fixed so many times.) 

This was about a month and a half before the end of the school year. So we had to see a fair bit of each other through mutual friends and it was rough. 

Over that summer, I decided to dig out that email I had been given and ask some more questions about the school since it was one of my top three. He responded within the day and from there it seemed like we were talking nonstop. We eventually added each other on Facebook, Snapchat etc and I found myself getting a crush on him. 

My last year of undergrad seemed to fly by as I focused on getting accepted to the University of York, and getting my visa paperwork prepared etc. Tour guide and I had both dated people casually but nothing serious. As my moving date drew closer he asked if I’d like to have dinner with him once I was settled in which I accepted. 

A relationship blossomed from that, and 4 years later that man is my husband and we live together in Manchester. I feel like the way that the other relationship failed really made me appreciate my future husband that much more.

O PT deveria ter demonstrado alguma vontade de melhorar, de mudar esse lado corrupto que ajudou a afundar o Brasil nessa crise de hoje, eles têm o pessoal, não precisavam se apoiar em Lula por populismo barato, eles têm caras como Suplicy no partido hoje. 

O que o PT fez parecer é que tá tudo bem roubar, que não tem problema contanto que eles usem desculpinhas baratas como ""não roubamos nada, isso é intriga da oposição"".

Outra coisa é que o plano de governo do PT desse ano é absurdamente estatista, eles não parecem reconhecer a crise, querem criar um novo imposto (para financiar projetos de sustentabilidade, mas ainda assim um novo imposto) e nem sequer preveem qualquer forma de reduzir os gastos em projetos públicos com PPPs ou coisa assim, eles querem gastar uma caralhada de dinheiro público indiscriminadamente de novo em obras e projetos grandes; sim, esse mesmo partido que não reconhece que cometeu erros como ser responsável por bilhões em despesas causadas pela corrupção de seus membros e de suas empreiteiras de estimação.

&gt; Delinquent Habits (a.k.a. Los Delinquentes) is a Chicano hip-hop group. Formed in Los Angeles in 1991, they are known for their Latin-tinged rap, which is both melodic and hardcore. Their first album was executive produced by Cypress Hill member Sen Dog and featured guest appearances by Sen himself as well as Puerto Rican New York City rapper Hurricane G. Their second album, Here Come The Horns, again featured Sen Dog as well as Sen's brother, pioneering Latin rapper Mellow Man Ace. The melodic ""Merry Go Round"" featured the female singer Michelle. The group chose to focus more on hardcore rap on their fourth offering, ""Freedom Band"".

&gt; The group itself originally consisted of two MCs, Ives and Kemo, and O.G. Style as the DJ. Thus the group was often called ""Los Tres Delinquentes"" (In English: ""The Three Delinquents""). In 1996, the group garnered international success with their first single ""Tres Delinquentes"" selling over one million copies. The success of the song pushed the group's self-titled album to nearly the same figure. Kemo soon left after the completion of their album Freedom Band to pursue a solo career with some substantial success. He was replaced by female vocalist Michelle, who had been previously featured in their songs

&gt; Rapper Ives makes one thing clear right from the start: ""Delinquent Habits is no Old-School-Band, we are fresh and constantly looking for something new."" On their new album ""The Common Man"" (09.10.2009) Delinquent Habits appear fresh for the first time in ages. The vibrant beats, the hot groove and the catchy lyrics make it clear: Someone knows how to rock the stage.

&gt; In the latter half of the 90's, Delinquent Habits along with Cypress Hill made it to the very top of Latin-Hip Hop. Rapper Ives and Kemo as well as DJ O.G Style combined Hip Hop beats with Funk and Miriachi trumpets and rapped in a mixture of Spanish and English called ""Spanglish"".

&gt; In 1996 they achieved a world-wide hit with ""Tres Delinquentes"". Their debut ""Delinquent Habits"" sold over 1 million copies and has achieved ""hip hop classic"" status the success of which is noticeable until this day. Sold-out tours in Europe and in the USA and four album releases, amongst these on their own label ""Station 13, are testament to this impressive feat. Delinquent Habits live the crossover and show no reservation. The Matiachi-Rappers shared stages with different acts such as Beck, Korn and The Fugees. Their songs were used in various soundtracks, as well as computer games, not to mention sportswear giant Nike added the DelHab-Song ""Return Of The Tres"" to its TV advert which was broadcast world-wide.

&gt; After Kemo und O.G. Style pulled out, Ives is the last remaining member of the original band and now head and songwriter of Delinquent Habits. But this is no reason for Ives to mope: ""Now I am able to have an input in all aspects of our music, beginning with the lyrics to the beats to the point of who I want to work with. This way ""The Common Man"" emerged, in collaboration with different producers such as Sick Jacken (Psycho Realm), Andre Horstmann (Pet Shop Boys, All Saints) or the Superstar DJs, which injected new life and ideas into the typical Delinquent Habits sound.

&gt; Ives finds his inspiration for his lyrics on the streets of his barrio and so on his new album ""The Common Man"", there is no mistaking - more critical and harsh tones next to the typical party tunes. This is reflected perfectly in the debut track, in which Ives denounces in a wonderful play on words society’s increasing egotism and the thieving mentality of the big bosses: ""They livin high on the hog but they really just all swine''.
Nevertheless Delinquent Habits still know that there is also room for the light-hearted side to life, which is best celebrated with hot parties. Affiliated with phat vibes and hot rhythms like on ""I Like It"", girls dancing on the tables with free flowing tequila: Delinquent Habits are in the house! Read more on Last.fm.

It started long before the referendum and was a slide further and further down to the bottom, which just ended up to the point. The EU was presented negatively or not at all for years and the EU even has a euromyths thing on their website to combat the misinformation put out there by the British press. With even many remain supporters believing in many of them and only supporting that option as more of the lesser of two evils.

Also loads of people didn’t care before then, with about [56% of leave voters] (https://lordashcroftpolls.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/timeline-by-LR.jpg) only making their minds up during the campaign. While there was a huge support for the idea of a referendum most people didn’t have strong feeling for the EU either way. So it is pretty ridiculous to claim a barrage of EU propaganda, just because there is some momentum to have another referendum. I mean if a leave option wins again then it would be much clearer that is what most of the public actually wants but if a remain option wins it would be clear that things have changed.

&gt;But they had to be pushed – because actually, they don’t really care. Take a closer look at the latest polls, and what you see is that a massive 97 per cent don’t consider the EU a big issue right now.

False,21stHeretic,1367423939.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_biy3r,,"&gt;During the 1870s and 1880s, the U.S. economy **rose at the fastest rate in its history, with real wages, wealth, GDP, and capital formation all increasing rapidly.** For example, between 1865 and 1898, the output of wheat increased by 256%, corn by 222%, coal by 800% and miles of railway track by 567%. Thick national networks for transportation and communication were created. The corporation became the dominant form of business organization, and a scientific management revolution transformed business operations.

&gt;By the beginning of the 20th century, gross domestic product and industrial production in the United States led the world. Kennedy reports that ""U.S. national income, in absolute figures in per capita, was so far above everybody else's by 1914."" Per capita income in the United States was $377 in 1914 compared to Britain in second place at $244, Germany at $184, France at $153, and Italy at $108, while Russia and Japan trailed far behind at $41 and $36.

&gt;Europe, especially Britain, remained the financial center of the world until 1914, yet the United States' growth caused foreigners to ask, as British author W. T. Stead wrote in 1901, ""What is the secret of American success?"" The businessmen of the Second Industrial Revolution created industrial towns and cities in the Northeast with new factories, and hired an ethnically diverse industrial working class, many of them new immigrants from Europe.

&gt;Wealthy industrialists and financiers such as John D. Rockefeller, Jay Gould, Henry Clay Frick, Andrew W. Mellon, Andrew Carnegie, Henry Flagler, Henry H. Rogers, J. P. Morgan, Leland Stanford, Meyer Guggenheim, Jacob Schiff, Charles Crocker, Cornelius Vanderbilt would sometimes be labeled ""robber barons"" by their critics, who argue their fortunes were made at the expense of the working class, by chicanery and a betrayal of democracy. Their admirers argued that they were ""Captains of Industry"" who built the core America industrial economy and also the non-profit sector through acts of philanthropy. For instance, Andrew Carnegie donated over 90% of his wealth and said that philanthropy was their duty—the ""Gospel of Wealth"". Private money endowed thousands of colleges, hospitals, museums, academies, schools, opera houses, public libraries, and charities. John D. Rockefeller donated over $500 million to various charities, slightly over half his entire net worth. Nevertheless, many business leaders were influenced by Herbert Spencer's theory of Social Darwinism, which justified laissez-faire capitalism, ruthless competition and social stratification.

&gt;This emerging industrial economy quickly expanded to meet the new market demands. **From 1869 to 1879, the U.S. economy grew at a rate of 6.8% for NNP (GDP minus capital depreciation) and 4.5% for NNP per capita. The economy repeated this period of growth in the 1880s, in which the wealth of the nation grew at an annual rate of 3.8%, while the GDP was also doubled. Economist Milton Friedman states that for the 1880s, ""The highest decadal rate [of growth of real reproducible, tangible wealth per head from 1805 to 1950] for periods of about ten years was apparently reached in the eighties with approximately 3.8 percent.""**

&gt;The rapid expansion of industrialization led to **real wage growth of 60% between 1860 and 1890**, spread across the ever-increasing labor force. **Real wages (adjusting for inflation) rose steadily, with the exact percentage increase depending on the dates and the specific work force. The Census Bureau reported in 1892 that the average annual wage per industrial worker (including men, women, and children) rose from $380 in 1880 to $564 in 1890, a gain of 48%. Economic historian Clarence D. Long estimates that (in terms of constant 1914 dollars), the average annual incomes of all American non-farm employees rose from $375 in 1870 to $395 in 1880, $519 in 1890 and $573 in 1900, a gain of 53% in 30 years**

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Age

&gt;Historians have characterised the mid-Victorian era (1850–1870) as Britain's ""Golden Years"". There was prosperity, **as the national income per person grew by half.**

&gt;**There was a spirit of libertarianism, says Porter, as people felt they were free. Taxes were very low, and government restrictions were minimal.**

&gt;19th century Britain saw a huge population increase accompanied by rapid urbanisation stimulated by the Industrial Revolution. Wage rates improved steadily; **real wages (after taking inflation into account) were 65 percent higher in 1901, compared to 1871.**

This can be accomplished without the privatization of means of production. Trading will happen under any economic system and isn't specific to capitalism.

&gt;  Capitalism is the powerhouse behind a lot of wealth in Europe, which  then feeds back into social services via taxes. Many European countries  are more capitalist than the US. 

Oh, I am all for a high tax bracket for the wealthy. I believe this can and should be used for social programs/services. However, if the means of production were publicly owned, we as workers could democratically decide how to spread that wealth. I think that'd be better for your average worker.

&gt; There are always going to be jobs that don't pay enough for you to live,  like working at McDonalds in the middle of San Fransisco. 

Unfortunately you're probably right. At least in my lifetime. This shouldn't be the case though. I don't care what job you work, but if you cannot get paid enough to have your basic needs met (housing, food, clothes, etc.), there's a serious problem. McDonald's for example, their CEO made something like $20 million last year, and then $30 billion to shareholders a few years back before that. Yet, for some reason a ""living wage"" just isn't possible.

&gt; Consider US healthcare. It is super expensive, because it is regulated and healthcare providers cannot compete with eachother. 

McKesson Corp, UH Group, and CVS Health made $600 billion last year. That's only three of the biggest healthcare companies but as you can see that's an obscene amount of money. Also note that big pharma CEO's rake in 7 figures easily. Healthcare is expensive because they don't want it to be affordable - they wouldn't make any money that way. Why isn't that wealth put back into the system or the employee's that produced it?

Gun violence is a problem in about four to five cites.  Chicago, Baltimore, St louis, Detroit, and New Orleans

If you take those out of the data, the US looks like most other western nations.

Please if you're going to lecture me on the country I live in, come with facts not a Snopes article and a wikipedia graph sourced with zero methodology.

The fact is most Americans live in areas that are more or less comparable across most dimensions to their European counterparts.  It depends on what country you're specifically looking at but the US tends to have a slightly higher gun homicide rate but a lower overall violent crime rate (more murders fewer aggravated assaults).  Admittedly comparing crime data across countries is perilous at best due to different reporting criteria, but most of the US is as safe as the rest of the world.  Stop watching TV and get off of your soap box.  Mass shootings remain extremely rare unless you count gang violence which tends to cluster in some admittedly very poorly run cities.

I did get in contact with some distant relatives, yes! I'll admit it's been different from getting in contact with distant relatives who are also from the States, or European, in that for example the Argentines have seemed less overall committed to tracing our trees and lineages, but it's still been helpful. Folks mostly stopped replying to me after a few messages, but I have managed to get enough from them prior to that to help me a lot. Given, I'm from the States, so maybe they feel they identify less with me or something, or they think I'm a scammer, pero también hablo Español entonces no sé cuanto vale ese análisis. Jajaja

My research in Argentina has gone not as well as my research in Italy, but not terribly, either. My family is incredibly old, and my parents not only had me older (in their 40's), but also were among the youngest of their generation (each the youngest of their siblings, and among the youngest of all their first cousins), so reaching out to family in Argentina has mostly consisted of talking to my parents' far older first cousins. This has been very helpful, as they remember information from longer ago. This makes it easier to get into the time period that has available records online (The US has up to the 1940 census available online, and plenty of even more recent records as well, but in Argentina it's been slim pickings past the year 1895!). Plus, by virtue of my grandmother's family having been in Argentina since the 1500's, they were very much upper-class folks, which makes them easier to find in records! Haha.

That said, I've had struggles too -- My grandmother's family were all from San Luis, a province where the available information is particularly little. My grandmother was born in 1908 and her parents were born in the 1870's. I've managed to find a few records about her parents' families, but I'm missing some of their siblings. That said, I have names for my grandmother's paternal grandparents (born in the 1830's and 1840's), and her maternal grandparents (born in the 1840's and 1850's), as well as her maternal grandmother's parents (born in the 1820's). I chalk a decent amount of this up to sheer dumb luck, though, because my grandmother's family was extremely tightly knit -- particularly my grandmother's maternal grandmother's family. For example, my mother grew up knowing her third cousins as family. I feel very fortunate to have had the many threads I've had to pull on!

Many of them have been loose threads though, and have required thinking outside the box to connect to the bigger picture. FamilySearch's Catalog and standard search haven't been particularly helpful, but searching the trees on there as well as their books (some of which I've been able to view at an FSAL) has provided additional information. Google Books and even simple Google boolean searches have also been enormously helpful, as well as being open-minded about searching for relatives on genealogy websites I wouldn't otherwise frequent (geneanet, myheritage, genealogiafamiliar, etc.). Writing to the *Museo de Inmigraciones de Buenos Aires* by e-mail and formally requesting immigration certificates for folks who went through the Port of Buenos Aires was also supplementarily helpful, not to mention easy as pie and entirely free of charge. I'll admit though, I also just have to get used to accepting a little less evidence than I normally would, because I have less available.

Some of those loose threads have come from my DNA matches, and other DNA matches have been to a few folks my Mom knew of, or at least whose ancestors she and/or her first cousins knew of or had heard of before, within the context of them being distant relatives.

Beyond that I haven't done much yet, but there's other things I'm planning to do. FamilySearch's Wiki has a great guideline on formally requesting documents by mail from different government &amp; church offices around Argentina and specifically around San Luis (although I do have a few ancestors who lived in Rosario and La Provincia de Córdoba -- immigrants from Italy who settled there, whom I plan to investigate via formal written mail-in requests as well, but with a lower priority to my grandmother's family because I've traced them all back to Italy, including generations past them in Italy), and that's absolutely something I'm expecting will be of bountiful additional help, haha. My understanding is also that with el número de DNI, we can request documents from La Policia Federal. I haven't done this yet either, but I'm planning to and I also expect it will be very helpful.

All that said, one thing -- I have had 0 luck whatsoever looking for newspaper snippets in Argentina, and it's been driving me absolutely bonkers because I've heard of events that transpired regarding some of my ancestors and there's no way that they wouldn't have been mentioned in the newspaper.

Any specific pointers for this situation? Evaluating ads when the data is low and perhaps other metrics to use other than analyzing the clicks&gt;sales funnel? I want to know whether new interests or ads copies themselves are working when the sales funnel takes a while and is driven by a few big spenders and not much else (niche product).

In our case customers buy once when they have a new baby, then spend between 50-250$ with us. So sales level data is low and delayed. If an ad of 10$ works on 1 person, it more than breaks even and turns a good profit after 2 (based on profit marging from average lifetime customer spend). 

Additionally the product is niche, and we are in a niche/small foreign (European) market to booth.

So it's hard to gain any meaningful data from 1 or 2 sales per few ads, but I have not dared to up the ad-spend. So I am looking for metrics to evalaute what's drawing customers that will purchase in.. even if they don't immediately purchase etc.

Additionally, people seem to have tracking etc. blocked at times so a lot of sales come up as ""direct"" visits to the website when they were probably from social media or sow the ad then visited the website without interacting with the ad, etc.

So, any specific pointers for this situation?

Prof Alessandro Strumia, of Pisa University, made the comments during a presentation organised by the group.

He said, in comments first reported by the BBC's Pallab Ghosh, that physics was ""becoming sexist against men"".

Cern said on Monday it was suspending Prof Strumia pending an investigation.

It stated that his presentation was ""unacceptable"".

""Cern always strives to carry out its scientific mission in a peaceful and inclusive environment,"" the statement reads, calling the presentation ""contrary to the Cern Code of Conduct"".

The organisation said it was ""unfortunate"" the views of the scientist, who works at a collaborating university, ""risks overshadowing the important message and achievements of the event"".

Seven trailblazing women in science
Female scientists post 'distractingly sexy' photos
Viewpoint: Women must fight sexism in science
Prof Strumia, who regularly works at Cern, was speaking at a workshop in Geneva on gender and high energy physics.

He told his audience of young, predominantly female physicists that his results ""proved"" that ""physics is not sexist against women. However the truth does not matter, because it is part of a political battle coming from outside"".

He produced a series of graphs which, he claimed, showed that women were hired over men whose research was cited more by other scientists in their publications, which is an indication of higher quality.

He also presented data that he claimed showed that male and female researchers were equally cited at the start of their careers but men scored progressively better as their careers progressed.

Another one of the slides from Alessandro Strumia's talk at Cern
When the BBC contacted Prof Strumia he said: ""People say that physics is sexist, physics is racist. I made some simple checks and discovered that it wasn't, that it was becoming sexist against men and said so.""

Last month, Prof Jocelyn Bell Burnell told the BBC she believed that unconscious bias against women prevented them from getting jobs in physics research.

And a major study published in 2012 in the US scientific journal PNAS showed that science faculty members rated identical job applications more highly when presented to them with a male name rather than a female name.

Scientists reacted to Prof Strumia's presentation on social media, complaining about discrimination they had suffered in the course of their work.

O sentimento foi apenas de tristeza.

Já não me dava com ela mas continuava a falar com os pais porque antes de ter mudado de casa para onde estou agora, estava na mesma rua que eles. Ela estava lá fora, em Londres.

Faleceu num acidente de carro mais o marido e a filha e voltou a casa. Da forma que terminámos, éramos capazes de estar na mesma sala e ignorarmo-nos activamente um ao outro. Mas não desejava nem por sombres que acontecesse algo assim.

Conhecia-a há anos, não podia não ir ao funeral. Usaram duas fotos, uma recente e uma daquela altura o que levou a que eu levasse mais dois murros no estômago naquele dia. Porque ao mesmo tempo que a via ali, lembrei-me do que me apaixonou nela naquela altura.

Foi mau e preferia não ter ido. Mas também não podia fazer essa desfeita aos pais dela. Tive outras que hoje são o típico Snorlax, essas teriam mais piada para contar a história. Mas o OP fala em primeiro amor por isso....

Antes deste caso tive uma cena com uma vizinha na primária. Mas sabíamos lá nós o que era isso, éramos apenas melhores amigos.

&gt;I love the times we live in, where people who murdered the natives in this land and enslaved African American are treated as equals to those whom were subjugated - is it a wonder that racism still exists today?""

Nothing logical or rational here just some emotional outrage? and typical sjw type of ""argument"" from incredulity. Yes history says that by default humans are monsters. all of them, it is only by education and hard work that they are able to rise above that.

&gt;No they weren't doing the same thing, lol. One was the invader, the other wanted to keep their home. Please use some logic in your future posts.

More snark and incredulity as if that is logic and reason? caricaturing all the European settlers as  demonic invaders is just as stupid as making all the natives savage cannibals.

&gt;Only a few tribes were responsible for the majority of what you are talking about. And none of the conflicts involved taking land, it was more about competition for resources. And saying that they were doing the same thing ignores the key issue at play - that of genocide.

&gt;Nice try, kid.

Ignoring basic logic, and using semantic bullshit fallacy as if fighting over resources is any different than fighting over land... And downplaying the near constant genocide of the tribes among each other. The mass graves and DNA don't lie. Also as stated REPEATEDLY in the thread, no one is downplaying or justifying genocide. only pushing back against this black and white good and bad notion like this is a fucking star wars movie. Then you end it with calling them a child. Totally a bastion of logic and reason you are.

&gt;Literally every redditor trying to justify genocide, lmao.

speaks for itself.

&gt;So good on you for trying to make the natives look like savage cannibals when the colonists weren't above doing the same.

Taking offense and reading into something that just isn't their. No one is trying to make native look like that, only pushing back against the noble savage and evil settler stereotypes.

&gt;Again, for the third time, it isn't the same thing, do you know the definition of the word ""functionally?"" Because I certain that you are using it wrong. It isn't the same thing because the food will keep you alive through the winter - the cold ground won't.

Not sure if you are being purposefully dense or really don't see how ""land"" and ""resources"" are the same thing in this context... Why did they want the land? To farm food (resource) raise animals (resource) lumber and minerals (resources)... I just cant even comprehend how you claim to be logical yet emotional blinders make you argue this point lol.

&gt;Check your privilege white man.

ah yes pure logic here.

However it does mean that chicken can be exported across the Atlantic. Which directly contradicts what Mr Hannan said...

It's also hard to explain why the US wouldn't be able to export chicken when Brazil can given that (a) the US is closer and (b) the US use of chlorination gives it a competitive advantage, since their farming practices have cost savings relative to European standards (which presumably Brazil needs to comply with for their current exports) and (c) US agriculture is heavily subsidized by their government and they are quite capable of exporting many other agricultural products.

This is honestly the biggest appeal to living in Europe for me. I love traveling to new places. Even just staying on the continent for a couple of years would give me time to travel to loads of places. 

I can totally understand the aversion to discussing family history. The US has lots of negative history as well, but people here tend to be proud of it regardless. I'm glad that some people still feel shame about what their ancestors were involved in. That's how to keep history from repeating itself.

It's kind of ironic that the biggest draw for me to Berlin is the history there. I want to visit all of those museums. 

I am okay with not having guns (don't own any now). I am not used to carrying cash, so that would definitely take some adjusting. Although, there are still small stores here in Los Angeles that do not accept debit cards. I'm not sure I understand how tipping works there, but in the US basically we are expected to routinely tip around 20% of the bill. So for example a bill that is 15 EUR would usually have a 10% tax (+1,50 EUR) and then a 20% tip (+3,00 EUR) meaning the meal would end up costing about 20 EUR. The downplayed patriotism and school spirit sound appealing to me. I think it can be a bit childish the way Americans get about high schools and colleges they went to when they were younger.

Those rent prices sound like heaven to me. The problem with rent here in Southern California is that if you live close to work then you're going to pay a fortune in rent. If you want to save money on rent then you have to move further away from work but that means sacrificing time out of your day. It's terrible. 

There are apartments right across the street from my work that just opened up. I would LOVE to live there. I thought they would be reasonably priced because there's nothing but hotels and large office buildings in this area. The one bedroom apartments are $3,000 (~2,800 EUR)! It's insane.

False,GranZero,1342207137.0,,immortal-difficulty,[],,,dark,text,t2_8bmg9,,"As is in world history, the height of Spain’s influence and power encompassed beyond its home continent. Philip II’s reign marked Spain’s Golden Age, as his territorial rule incorporated homeland Spain, and all the way to their colonies. This wide-ranging expanse of an empire is embodied in the game, as you are encouraged to settle or conquer lands in differing continents. Spain’s playstyle is clunky to say the least, as most of its synergy revolves around the use of their Conquistadors.

&amp;#x200B;

**Historical Significance**

Philip II of Spain is the progeny of the Habsburg dynasty, with its relationships interwoven in the 1500s European monarchy. In the Age of Exploration, Spain reigned supreme with her colonies. Philip inherited various titles, including riches, which he used for his and Spain’s advantage. He was also a staunch defender of Catholicism, and most of Spain’s intercolonial policies were laced with religious agenda. In turn, he symbolized the height of Spanish authority, and subsequently maintained the dominance of Christianity in Europe and in the New World.

&amp;#x200B;

**Priority Districts**

* Holy Site – Spain is one of the few civilizations in game that have a strong religious game, but have no bonuses in acquiring one. As such, their first priority is to get a religion. If you are lucky that a different continent is a few tiles away, settle there, grow it, and rush Stonehenge with a trade route to another Spanish city for growth and production bonus.
* Campus – Construct these early for the technological advances, and then increase the gains even further once you have Missions online. Spain is probably the only other religious civ that can compete with Arabia in terms of science output, and their missions have a huge role on that.
* Harbour – As a colonial power, Spain relied on its ships to impose its authority on the seas. Build Harbours to capitalize Spain’s unique ability to build fleets and armadas earlier than the competition. Harbours are also one of the strongest districts due to its requirement to be built on coasts, and it should help you with the growth and trade routes needs.

&amp;#x200B;

**Priority Yields**

Faith and science are both strong yields for Spain, and they excel in getting them…as soon as they have access to their unique improvement, Mission. Early on though, your priority is food/growth so you can expand rapidly in order to build more Holy Sites for a religion. Growth is also important so you can settle on other continents beyond your own. Finally, more cities mean more space to build Mission improvements on. Though you can always conquer more cities for space down the road. In summary, ancient Spain’s focus should be growth, while Renaissance Spain is faith and science.

&amp;#x200B;

**Priority Settlements**

Your priority settlement as Spain is outside your original capital’s continent. You would want to maximize the Treasure Fleet bonuses by creating an intercontinental empire. In the Ancient era, you can also prioritize looking for stone, so you can rush Stonehenge to secure a religion. If you can, start internal trade routes from the city building the Stonehenge for production. Besides these, your other priority would be mountainous regions for your Holy Sites and Campuses.

&amp;#x200B;

**Changes from Civilization V**

It is not far-fetched to say that Spain received drastic nerfs from Civ 5 into Civ 6. While Spain 5 can be regarded as the master of exploration, Spain 6 is trying its best to synergize its uniques. Spain 5 is a high-risk, high-reward gameplay that is heavily reliant on location and luck. It was encouraged to scout the world for wonders. With Spain 6, you are still at the mercy of some luck in founding a religion, but you will need to work hard to earn one. Spain 5 Tercio became Spain 6 Conquistador while embracing its religious nature. Spain 5 Conquistador is still one of the best units in the game, and its counterpart in Spain 6 is a far cry from their predecessor even though it’s currently Spain 6’s best part of its bonuses. Gone is the one-time bonus gold for discovering a natural wonder, but in its place is the trade route bonus between continents, which I believe is better in the long run. Spain 5 has a focus on culture and military domination, with a little flexibility depending on the wonders you have discovered. Spain 6 focuses on religion, and are strong on the scientific front. Domination is very feasible after researching Gunpowder for the Conquistadors.

&amp;#x200B;

**Intended Playstyle**

Religious civilizations play a certain style --- defensive first in the early eras. Spain is no different; you need to focus on defending yourself while building Holy Sites and expanding as much as possible. Do expand to continent beyond yours, but also remember that Missions also will appear later for the Loyalty bonus. While Conquistadors are one of the stronger unique units in the game, they take a while to appear in the game. They have to rely on diplomacy and defenses early game. Build up your technology and armies then go for timed upgrades to conquer your enemies once you have access to Conquistadors. Spain is one of the few civs that go from defense to offense in the later eras.

&amp;#x200B;

**Alliances**

As Spain, you will have to play with cunning. Befriend as many allies as possible early on, with the intent of conquering them later. You will not be liked, but you can be friendly before your uniques come online. Try to get a Religious alliance with a civ whose religion you have wiped off the face of the world. A Research alliance with the last civ in tech is worth pursuing if you can send a ton of trade routes to them, and if they are not in same continent of the origin city. Finally, keep a Military alliance last if you can find someone who can join you in your military conquests.

&amp;#x200B;

**As an Adversary**

Take Spain out early on if you are its neighbours. Spain has no combat bonuses until they get a religion, and before their Conquistadors. If Spain does get a religion, let Philip spread his on your cities, and it will negate his El Escorial bonus, as well as get on his good side.

I say that Michelle Obama made gardening fashionable, and everybody knows what broccoli is because everybody eats it raw with cream cheese or hummus dip.  They tell me I'm mistaken, because Americans only eat at Burger King and they don't know what broccoli, and in fact, they don't even know what an onion looks like unless it's sliced on a burger.  They also helpfully inform me that Americans do not have any good food because everything is bland and tastes like nothing.  I tell them that actually Americans are addicted to flavor, and everything is over flavored, over salted, over sweet.  They tell me I'm mistaken, because Americans don't even know what Arugula is.  I tell them that Americans follow the price of Arugula closely.

You say that like it's some terrible inconvenience to *optionally* click on a couple of buttons in an app... 

&gt;If your information got stolen with a credit card, and you can’t cancel it in time, those purchases are the credit card companies problem, not yours.

Given that I've never seen anything to this effect in any sort of official writing, I decided to dig in, and... nothing. This either does not apply where I live (Europe), or is at best a rumour. Feel free to prove me wrong, and not with an American source since that's worthless here. On the other hand, both debit and credit cards enjoy the same protections once their cancelled, meaning I'm on the hook for *at most* $50 (could be $15, dunno if the law passed or not, article was fairly recent but speaking in future tense) of pre-cancellation transactions, with the addendum that it's $0 if the card was used without a PIN or similar security code, i.e. it's the fault of their security not mine. In short, there's no guarantee that I'm any better off.

&gt;The cash back that you get is not much in a given purchased, but it adds up and is essentially free money when you compare it to a debit card

It comes out to a wildly unlikely maximum of less than a week's worth of wages a year, **if** I specifically go after it. Again, I'm not pulling numbers out of my ass here, this is what the bank says. Yeah, it's free money, but realistically next to nothing, and definitely not worth the risk. 

As it is, I'm fraud-proof. My internet purchases are untouchable, and unlike (American) credit cards my debit card has a PIN without which it cannot be used, so physically stealing it is pointless. There's really not much to improve in that regard.

&gt;If you have Jack shit for credit history, then you will end up paying more interest on these things.

Credit score is a thing only in the US and maybe the UK. I'm 30, I have no debt, never did, and in all likelihood never will. Even if I will, it'll be covered by the home I own, and will have nothing to do with some weird quasi-XP system.

Literally less than my hourly wage. Equivalent of, what... 15 USD? $20? Golly gee, don't spend it all in one place!

By contrast, I can get cash from an ATM for free using a debit card, while the fees are nothing short of daylight robbery for a credit card (3.22% + the rough price of a cheap beer, in the case of my bank), which is something I forgot to mention: due to this simple factor it's basically mandatory to have *both* anyway.",True,False,False,,0,1538434164,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e6zvqaf,False,t3_9k5wor,True,t1_e6zrver,/r/videos/comments/9k5wor/im_29_years_old_with_nearly_1000000_in_debt/e6zvqaf/,,1539929034,1,True,False,videos,t5_2qh1e,r/videos,public,

La domenica prima 23/09 con Francesca Fanuele ""Berlusconi si candida alle europee"" ha 7141 visite (con 7 giorni in più, ma non credo siano aumentate di molto le visite visto che è un tg), 49 mi piace, 28 non mi piace, 39 commenti. Di questi 17 contro la giornalista, 4 a difesa della giornalista ed i rimanenti per lo più contro Berlusconi e proM5S

Il venerdi prima 28/09 con Mentana ""borsa giù, spread su"" (che fa le edizioni serali dal lunedì al venerdì) 7954 visite, 55 mi piace, 46 non mi piace, 37 commenti.  
Di questi 7 contro mentana, 7 contro il PD, 6 contro il governo

I'm also not entirely sure I'd trust Wikipedia: "" Many people on the political right consider ""[Antifa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifa_(United_States))"" to be ""domestic terrorists"", even though there formal organisation of this name in the US. ""  


The structure of that sentence aside ""even though there formal"" and the spelling ""organisation"" (European English spelling) also aside: Antifa is considered a domestic terrorist organization by the United States government: [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/antifa-domestic-terrorists-us-security-agencies-homeland-security-fbi-a7927881.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/antifa-domestic-terrorists-us-security-agencies-homeland-security-fbi-a7927881.html)  


So it's not just ""Many on the right"", it's the United States government itself, that considers Antifa to be a domestic terror threat.  


Also: There is no valid statistical threat calculation for right-wing vs left-wing domestic terrorism in the United States today.  The political landscape has shifted in the past few years.  So using statistics based on an aggregate domestic terrorist threat over the last 20-30 years is invalid.  The domestic terrorism of today isn't like the Unibomber's anarchism (which isn't right-wing in the modern context) or abortion clinic bombings of the 1980s and 1990s.  Left-wing terrorism is also more often violent but less often deadly.  That is, left-wing groups are more likely to terrorize people and start fights, but less likely to engage in major shootings.  They prefer political assassination and intimidation tactics where their victims remain alive to suffer.  


As such, which is more threatening to society is also debatable.  A Dylan Roof killing isn't a danger to the government nor to society as a whole, it's a threat to individual lives and local communities.  An Antifa counter-rally preventing free expression and free assembly of people who they disagree with politically is far more likely to lead into social unrest.  


It's also noteworthy that right-wing domestic terrorism tends to be lone wolves, not organized efforts.  This is also why they're largely weak and not major threats to society.  Left-wing domestic terrorism is based on disparate cells acting independently, much more like modern terrorist networks like Al Qaeda, which makes them both more effective and more potentially dangerous.  


The saving grace so far is that people on the left tend to fear/dislike guns (not violence - they're fine with physically beating people, just not shooting them), but that is changing, too.  Left-wing groups have started gun clubs and started talking online about ways to train, and their rallies and counter-rallies are often advocating for arming to be able to ""fight back"" against the right wing people at rallies, which tend NOT to be terrorists (or even particularly armed).",True,False,False,,0,1538441387,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e702z3q,False,t3_9kadhj,False,t1_e6xtt9n,/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/9kadhj/is_there_a_true_breaking_point_that_can_cause/e702z3q/,,1539932436,3,True,False,PoliticalDiscussion,t5_2sfmf,r/PoliticalDiscussion,public,

Sempre que ouvi falar da praxe, ouvi falar dela num contexto atual, não a pensar no que aconteceu nos séculos passados.

Para além do mais, se for procurar ao dicionário, como me falaste nele, a primeira coisa que aparece e que a praxe é que é basicamente um ""costume"".

Agora se pegam na palavra, começam a usá-la para descrever o que quer que faziam, não posso fazer nada quanto a isso.

Agora na minha opinião a praxe é isso mesmo, o costume de se fazer um ritual de iniciação.

Quanto ao uso da palavra praxe mesmo tendo em conta o significado de há muitos anos: 

Se não estou em erro, o uso da expressão ""santinho"" quando alguém espirra era usado para simbolizar preocupação quanto ao estado de saúde de alguém (visto que na altura o raio de uma gripe já era perigosa como tudo).  Agora eu não acho que ninguém nos dias de hoje esteja a morrer só porque espirra, mas digo o santinho na mesma, porque sempre se disse  tal como agora chamo praxe ao que vejo na minha universidade, sem querer andar a bater nem traumatizar ninguém, porque sempre se chamou praxe. (Nem sempre, mas também não sejamos picuinhas)

Agora não adianta de nada andarmos por aqui a bater com a testa no teclado por opiniões. Eu vou continuar a achar que o que se faz na minha universidade ( dentro da praxe legítima e com nada destas porcarias) é praxe. Se tu achas que não, pronto.

In the article, he cites the people he is critiquing, notably Kropotkin.

&gt;But that article was from 1913. His ideas changed totally after seeing the Russian revolution.

Yes, but his stance on anarchism did not. Not only is there [this piece](http://libcom.org/library/anarchism-not-suitable-anton-pannekoek) from much later, but we've also got some excerpts from his later work where he shows his distance from both anarchism and syndicalism:

&gt;In the doctrine of syndicalism, ""labor the basis of the new world,"" means that the syndicat, the union will be its organization unit. The union, it says, is the free creation of the workers, their field of self-government, whereas in the State the officials and politicians, and in the political parties the intellectuals dominate. A political revolution that should make the State master of production would mean a more oppressive slavery for the workers. Liberation of the workers by revolution is only possible as a destruction of State and Government. It must be brought about by a universal strike, a common action of all its workers. In its place shall come the free association of all the unions; the unions will be the bodies to organize and direct production.  
&gt;  
&gt;These principles clearly expound their dependence on the forms of French capitalism. Since the contents of politics stood at a wide distance from the productive work of society with its struggle of real class interest, the working class held itself at a wide distance from politics. Since politics was a dirty business of personal intrigue, the workers disdained to get mixed up with politics. Their practice, proclaimed as class war, theoretically for abolishing exploitation, practically for better working conditions, was comprised entirely within the field of production, where it acted by means of the syndicats. Syndicalism did not intend to yield or to submit to bank capital; in the syndicalist slogans of anti-patriotism, anti-militarism, and universal strike, it expressed its refusal to be carried away in the militaristic policy of bank capital.

- Pannekoek, the article you keep on citing as proof Pannekoek is compatible with anarcho-syndicalism  


&gt;The council system embodies the dictatorship of the proletariat.

- Pannekoek, an article with the same name as the previous article, but it's a different article  


Furthermore, we can go look at other council coms. I've already cited Mattick, so here's Herman Gorter:  


&gt;We must therefore engage in the fiercest struggle against both the Third International and the Russians, such as Lenin, Zinoviev, and Radek, and the syndicalists, anarchists and the like. Neither possess a tactic based on the class relations of Western Europe and North America.  


- Gorter, *The Organisation of the Proletariat's Class Struggle*. 

For some context here, Gorter is criticizing anarchists and syndicalists for rejecting the party. In general, the KAPD was hostile to the FAUD.

False,diverseandsundry,1481154097.0,,,[],,Church of Ireland,dark,text,t2_13ecj6,," **1.How have feast days been historically celebrated in the church (Anglican and otherwise)?**

They were the holidays and were marked both in the Church's liturgy and in everyday celebration and customs. Honestly, if you think of Christmas and St. Patrick's day except spread throughout the year, you've more of a sense (though of course Christmas lasted twelve days till the 6th of January rather than a month). 

For example, Saturday just gone was Michaelmas (St. Michael and All Angels) was a day where people traditionally cooked a goose and eating it was thought to bring them good luck: as late as 1812 Jane Austen writes "" I dined upon goose yesterday, which, I hope, will secure a good sale of my second edition.""

The Churches of England and Ireland have obviously kept the common feasts of the church and their more particular ones. After the Reformation, there was a great reduction in the number of feasts celebrated but all the major feast days were given their own scripture readings and lessons For example, St Matthew's day (two weeks ago) has a scripture reading concerning Christ calling Matthew and this prayer, 

&gt;O ALMIGHTY God, who by thy blessed Son didst call Matthew from the receipt of custom to be an Apostle and Evangelist; Grant us grace to forsake all covetous desires, and inordinate love of riches, and to follow the same thy Son Jesus Christ, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Ghost, one God, world without end. Amen.

**2.How did these celebrations evolve over the 20th century? As a category, they definitely feel less important today.**

The twentieth century contributed only in so much as both secularised and Americanised the way in which the Anglo-speaking West marked time and so feast days have generally been set aside as part of ordinary life outside Church. Likewise, within Church, the effect of both Vatican II and other trends in liturgy combined with this secular tendency has lead to feasts usually being moved to either preceeding or succeeding Sundays as Church's have become much less reluctant to require or even offer weekday services and the sense of feast days has been lesssened. 

 **3.I walk into a church on a feast day. What concrete things are different (besides idiosyncratic celebrations specific to whomever is being commemorated)?**

I'm not quite sure what you're asking if you're saying apart from idiosyncratic. If you mean, what's common to a feast day, it will depend, of course, upon the rite and tradition. In Anglican churches there will be, as I noted above, particular prayers and lessons for that day. 

There may also be a Eucharist rather than merely the Offices and more elaborate ceremony for the day. This varies of course depending on the partiuclar Church and parish use with liturgy always being variable. 

 **4.Aside from the obvious examples of Christmas and St. Patrick's Day, were feast days generally understood to have both religious and secular components to their observation?**

Yes, feast days were how time and the year were divided up until the modern era and even now are prominent holidays (like Christmas and St Patrick's Day) in many parts of the world. Here and in England, the Courts and Universities have Michaelmas, Hilary, Easter and Trinity terms (with Christmas, Easter and Whitsun vacations). In France, All Saints Day is still a public holiday where even non-religious remember their dead friends and relations. 

Likewise Ascension Day, Whistun and Corpus Christi are still public holidays in parts of the European continent. 

**5. Change feast to fast. What concrete things are different?**
A fast is usually not celebrated (as the name would imply) or marked in liturgy - with the exception of Lent, Advent, Rogation and Ember days. They were traditionaly days to fast, pray and abstain from secular activity as much as possible.

As an aside trypanosoma brucei and the botfly make agriculture very difficult today. Farm animals are killed by the parasites, and tractors are very expensive, requiring heavy upkeep compared to agricultural yield.  

Rice farming allows better yield and more class specialization than hunter gatherer tribes in Africa. 

That specialization allowed the asian countries to develop advances technologies, art and culture and silk which was highly sought by the west. For Japan and China trade occurred instead of pillaging and slavery, for the most part. 

There were definitely attempts to colonize, but Russia failed to maintain their colonies due to insurrections. See Manchuria drama. Japan had a fortifiable position and was relatively isolated from the west, their colonialism ambitions forced the west out of asia is some cases. See Russo Japanese war. 

I would say a huge reason for the prosperity of Asia is simply that it is large fertile and difficult to control. 

Africa is just south of Europe, an easy target for colonialism. Japan is on the other side of China, it’s untouchable by the west in comparison.

I found out my father’s people had left in one of the first groups to leave Africa. His group settled the Korean Peninsula and became the ancestors of modern Koreans. My ancestors moved on and kept moving, but amongst my genetic markers, almost 7% are Korean because of that. Weird, because when I was younger, many people described me as seeming to have African facial features (while white as they come). His people then spent almost several thousand years slowly working along the trade routes between China and Europe, eventually settling in England as part of the Saxon Invasion.
My mother’s people were amongst the last large group to leave Africa and her ancestors made straight for England to be come the Anglos. 
Ironically,  I was raised in a Very proud of their roots Irish family. Finding out I had an Anglo-Saxon pedigree proven and more solid than most I find rather hilarious. Especially imagining the Americans who would be terribly jealous of my ancestry, but I hardly care.
Also interesting. Before my parents ancestors moved to the United States they spent a thousand years or so living in Northern England barely fifty miles away from each other.

Naquele dia ela foi uma das ultimas chegar, caiu na pegadinha do durex, deu uma risadinha e tal, entrou na brincadeira.

A gente tava com uma matéria que trabalhava em grupos e tal, ela tava fazendo uns desenhos tão concentrada, mas feliz ao mesmo tempo que deu aquela hipnotizada e tal, e no final da aula resolvi chamar ela pra sair. 

Ela fez um cara meio triste e foi pro banheiro, uma colega do meu grupo mandou um ""não acredito que você fez isso"" virou a cara e foi atrás dela pra consolar, e uma amiga que de anos que foi meu anjo da guarda muitas vezes, já mandou um ""você é muito burro, vai fazer isso bem hoje?"". Só ai eu lembrei que era 1º de Abril e ela achou que eu tava fazendo pegadinha com ela porque eu lembrava da data, vide a pegadinha do durex.

The CBI conducts a number of monthly and quarterly economic surveys of businesses, on manufacturing, retail, and service sectors, which are an important bellwether of UK business and economic trends. 

These surveys are used by the European Commission to enable it to collect robust European-wide economic data, as it does from all the 28 EU member states. As part of this, the CBI takes part in a competitive tendering process (every 4 years) to provide data on the UK economy on a regular basis, and as a result the European Commission currently contributes to some of the financing of these economic surveys.

This amounts to approximately £140,000 this year, representing around 0.6% of our annual income. It is a measure of the reliability of our data that we are able to do this, and any money received in this way is ring-fenced for this purpose.

A keep (from the Middle English kype) is a type of  fortified tower built within castles during the Middle Ages by European nobility. Scholars have debated the scope of the word keep, but usually consider it to refer to large towers in castles that were fortified residences, used as a refuge of last resort should the rest of the castle fall to an adversary. The first keeps were made of timber and formed a key part of the Motte-and-Bailey castles that emerged in Normandy and Anjou during the 10th century; the design spread to England as a result of the Norman invasion of 1066, and in turn spread into Wales during the second half of the 11th century and into Ireland in the 1170s. The Anglo-Normans and French rulers began to build stone keeps during the 10th and 11th centuries; these included Norman keeps, with a square or rectangular design, and circular shell keeps.

It's really hard to answer on PS1. Some are, while others are programmed independently from their video refresh rate (like most modern games or all PC games are). Usually it's safe to assume that a 2D game is likely to run 17% slower, but as far as I've been told the Crash Bandicoot games are an example of games that will run at the same speed in their NTSC and PAL versions.

Basically, there's no reason for a 3D game to be tied to the video's refresh rate, but that doesn't mean you can rely on them running fine. I think especially Japanese developers are notorious for sticking to timing their games to the video updates.

One thing I can tell you for sure is that the Capcom Generations releases, which was released as five separate releases in Japan, and as far as I'm aware wasn't released in the US, but as one disc with vol. 1-4 in Europe - this *will* run too slow in the European version, so stay away from that one. In general that's a pretty safe assumption for most arcade ports, 3D games included. On PS2 a lot of ports did have a built in 60hz option, as well as games like Shadow of the Colossus and the Contra games, and most fighters.

As a side note, it's worth noting that unlike the NES and SNES, where the console controls wether the game runs 50hz or 60hz, on the PS1 it's controlled by the game. So if you get a US or Japanese game and play it on a modded European console, it will still run 60hz (and I think it's running PAL-60, while the game tries to output NTSC color, which is why you get a greyscale image if you aren't using a proper RGB cable)",True,False,False,,0,1538466012,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e70mobo,False,t3_9kjlqh,False,t3_9kjlqh,/r/retrogaming/comments/9kjlqh/how_well_does_pal_playstation_1_and_2_games_play/e70mobo/,,1539941612,7,True,False,retrogaming,t5_2qk6v,r/retrogaming,public,

**Game 1: Pilot**

[6-3 TCJ, 4/11 were TagPros for TCJ](https://tagpro.eu/?match=1984170)

Not much to say. We won the half and pups were pretty well balanced. I don't thin anyone can argue we didn't deserve this half.

[3-1 THS, 4/13 were TagPros for TCJ](https://tagpro.eu/?match=1984177)

THS outplayed us and it was a close half. Pups were pretty well balanced. I don't think this half is up to be argued about.

---

**Game 2: Emerald**

[3-3 Tie, 3/5 were TagPros for TCJ](https://tagpro.eu/?match=1984182)

[7-6 TCJ, 6/11 were TagPros for TCJ](https://tagpro.eu/?match=1984187)

On Emerald especially, our team had some pretty ridiculous TagPro rng with 9/16 pups being TagPros. Ultimately we lost the game anyway so who cares. There's no point discussing Emerald but it does contribute a lot to people thinking we only won cuz of pups, so just keep in mind that this match skews things a lot despite it being a loss anyway so the TagPro distribution really doesn't mean anything.

---

**Game 3: Transilio (this is probably the one you'll care about if you wanna say THS deserved a win)**


[6-6 Tie, 7/15 were TagPros for TCJ, 5/12 were TagPros for THS](https://tagpro.eu/?match=1984190)

Lots of TagPros for both teams this match. The TagPro distribution favored our team slightly but I'll analyze our caps so people can have the info: 

First cap from THS and TCJ: both teams get a TagPro and both are aggresive to use them for a cap. THS has a more successful TagPro so they get theirs first. I cap off flagpro so my TagPro really didn't matter.

2nd cap for TCJ: We win 2/3 pups, both were TagPros. We cap from using them properly.

3rd cap for TCJ: All pups were rollings. We cap. No TagPros to talk about.

4th cap for TCJ: TCJ sweep all 3 pups. 2 are TagPros and we cap.

5th cap for TCJ: No pups.

6th cap for TCJ: THS sweep pups and get a TagPro. We cap anyway against their TP.

2nd cap for THS: THS win a TagPro and cap.

3rd cap for THS: THS win 2 JJ and an RB. They cap.

4th cap for THS: No Pups

5th cap for THS: No pups.

6th cap for THS: Both teams win a TagPro and THS caps during the fight for pups. 

So for the first half pups played a bit of a factor but were *reasonably* balanced.

[2-1 TCJ, 10/14 were TagPros for TCJ](https://tagpro.eu/?match=1984194)

THS 1st cap: TCJ win a TagPro and Bright gets a rolling bomb on flag with a juke juice chaser. They cap using the rolling bomb to grab.

1st cap for TCJ: THS sweeps pups and get 2 RBs and a JJ. We cap anyway.

2nd cap for TCJ: We win 2/3 pups. 1 is a TP and one is a JJ. THS win a TagPro. I cap.

---

Personal takeaways:

Did powerup distribution play a factor? Pilot and Emerald: overwhelmingly no.

On trans? Yes, somewhat. 1st half where we tied I don't think they made a difference. 2nd half we we didn't use a single TagPro to cap, despite winning 10. If you wanna say we need to use pups better then I absolutely agree. We probably shoulda capitalized more on that distribution than we did. However, the TagPros in that half were not what pushed over and created our opportunities. Granted, I'll give that they likely stiffed opportunities for THS to cap, but then again honestly in today's meta a juke juice is just as effective at stopping the opponent from making plays. 

My personal thoughts are that the game was incredibly close either way. It's disappointing to see people trying to take away from our win like this, but I understand why there might be some frustration. Regardless, I'm thrilled with how *both* teams played and think it made for an exciting event for players and viewers alike. In my heart of hearts I think if we replay that game over and over, they're almost always gonna be close games and personally it was one of my favorite games I've played in my career. It sucks that THS especially (or Eggo at least) don't seem to think we deserve the win, but whatever. I'm proud of how we played and at the end of the day both teams outplayed eachother at points in the game and the game could have gone either way.

Regular (non-C) USB connections are designed to be monodirectional connections between a 'master' device and a 'slave' device. The A connector goes into the controlling device, and the B connector goes into the controlled device (usually a peripheral), and the cables themselves reflect that direction. In order to avoid confusion, A and B connectors are different shapes. This holds true for all of the form factors (standard, mini, or micro). So yes, there technically is something like a USB Micro-A connector, but those are very rare. And you shouldn't be able to plug them into Micro-B ports. However, there are ports that actually accept **both** A and B connectors:

You won't need anything special if you don't plan to go into the jungle and Elephants are usually not out far enough to consider Malaria a real risk. The most important is definitely an up to date Tetanus and since there was a recent outbreak in some areas, Japanese Encephalitis.

If you go with a travel insurance, which I recommend, rabies shots will be covered if you get scratched or bitten which is quite unlikely unless you love to pet every damn cat that crosses your path - like me.     

Regarding the elephants - make sure you choose the right place to avoid disappointment and support of places that shouldn't get any. Many that seem legit, are not. There is a real sanctuary which is booked out weeks in advance. They take care of injured, crippled and old elephants and have a great reputation.

Last suggestion; if you get an open wound, no matter how small it is, you will want to treat it with anti septic cream. Open wounds heal extremely badly in the humid weather, smog and dirty water. What would close in 1 day or 2 can take as much as a week or longer to show progress and even then it will often stay infected beneath the skin. Speaking from personal experience.

Anderlecht, used to cause us problems in the CL...like 15-20 years ago. We barely made it past them as well

&gt; A new Russian missile is putting at risk a 31-year-old nuclear treaty between Washington and Moscow long regarded as a cornerstone for stability in Europe, the chief of NATO said on Tuesday.

&gt; At issue is Russia&amp;#039;s new 9M729 ground-launched missile, which the U.S. says violates the INF&amp;#039;s ban on all ground-launched intermediate-range cruise and ballistic missiles with a range of between 310 AND 3,400 miles.

&gt; While Russia has denied that the system violates the INF, NATO says the treaty is in jeopardy of unraveling.

It used to be that way but that is no longer the case, at least in my country.

I remember the presidential elections between Bush and Gore. Gore was clearly the preferred candidate, as he was ideologically closest to us, but Bush was seen as just another pro-business USA presidential candidate. When Bush got elected, the general mood was one of mild disappointment. No one I know would have guessed that G.W. Bush would destroy the USA's reputation the way he did. During the Bush-years, most sentiment was anti-Bush or anti-USA (Bush is still generally considered a war criminal over here). Later in his presidency, the cronies in his government (most of them Republicans) became generally known.

This changed when Obama was elected and Republican party members became news items with their ridiculous theories about birth certificates, proposals to default on USA debt, shutting down the USA government, ...

By the time the Clinton - Trump campaign received news coverage, things were more or less as they are now. The Republican party is generally seen as a collection of religious fanatics, corrupt corporate stooges and racists. The fact that their voters chose Trump, the worst candidate of a bad lot, to represent them enforced this view. By now, people are aware that there is a distinction between ""the USA"" and ""Trump, the Republican party and its supporters"". It is also public knowledge that Trump lost the popular vote (e.g. was elected on a technicality). The only thing people blame the non-Trump supporting part of the USA for is not voting in high enough numbers to block him.

Long story short: most people in Europe can (and do) make the distinction between the USA population and it's current government. We are less optimistic about whether the USA will manage to avoid electing another Trump in the future (e.g. Bush got reelected as well).

Bonjour Air France, je viens de payer mes impôts pour la première fois la semaine dernière et j'ai eu tellement mal que j'ai décidé de me renseigner sur les dispositifs de defiscalisation.

Je suis actuellement en coloc depuis 18 mois (et ça se passe niquel !) avec un ami qui s'est trouvé dans la même situation, à payer un impôt douloureux (celib et salaire de ~40k brut). On s'est dit : ""mais pourquoi pas investir chacun dans du neuf via Pinel et se louer les apparts l'un l'autre ?"". Évidemment le but n'est pas forcément de faire ça sur les 9 à 12 ans requis mais au moins de s'assurer l'un l'autre un minimum, d'éviter un gap si déménagement etc.

Je me demandais donc si certains r/français avaient déjà pensé ou testé ça, si c'était légal et acceptable vis à vis du fisc (qui accepte la location aux ascendants et descendants donc moi je vois pas pourquoi ce serait problématique), et si plus généralement la loi Pinel était intéressante.

False,taboo__time,1432201617.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_nlm08,,"I think my basic burning thought in a lot of this is the left and liberal side are failing to recognise and accept the natural human ingroup/outgroup bias.
 
A lot of the arguments from the left to right on immigration, racism, IQ claims, identity, religion and so on really stem from an evolved human bias towards the ""ingroup"" and away from ""outgroups."" However the groups are defined.
 
It's not comprehensive and not absolute and it naturally varies in people but it explains a lot more things than the usual left or right explanations.
 
A basic function of human behaviour is to have a group culture. Within that culture it defines morality, literally what good and bad is to a degree within biological drives.
 
People tend to care less how the outgroup operates. It isn't ""their place to judge."" Nationality was a social construction in part to resolve who gets to judge whom.
 
&gt; There’s nothing wrong with tackling problems that arise in different cultures that are present in western society. If someone is shutting down a conversation about these types of things it’s probably because they don’t believe the arguments against the effects of multiculturalism are being made in good faith.

Sure. But you know the spiral. Anyone who debates it, or often any cultural related topic, without taking the most liberal side is labelled a racist.
 
That pattern happens until the only people who are arguing against any ""cultural outgroup"" activities are the true far right. And the majority are then silently agreeing with them. A dangerous political place.

&gt; A majority of discussions I hear and see against multiculturalism in the UK are rooted in xenophobia, racism or perhaps in this case islamophobia. Luckily I can see you’re not coming from these starting positions (to the best of my knowledge), thus people such as yourself and I can have reasoned discussions about this subject matter in a calm and composed way that isn’t ‘Make Britain British Again’ vs ‘You just hate people who are different from you.’


Whether I am coming from a bad place or not depends where your line is. It can feel like pointing out that people are naturally ingroup biased is racist. I'm not saying they ought to always act upon that. I am super skeptical of the ""citizen of the world"" identity. And the no border global capitalist position.
 
If I say the liberal and left side has been well meaning but gotten into an ideological mess over cultural questions is that over the line?

&gt; Anarchy is a misused word I think, as that political ideology is more to do with leaderless and collectivism-driven local governments. The word you’re looking for would be chaos, which I think is disingenuous as our immigration is controlled, but maybe not regulated in a manner some may wish.


It seems to be somewhere between the two. Like neoliberalism in general. it became closer to a vision of anarcho capitalism. ""Pay whatever tax that you like. Worship as you like. Call yourself what you like. Just try to make money and don't commit violence."" Which works until it doesn't.

&gt; Sure. They’re the ones perpetuating it and clearly don’t see why it’s a bad thing so they are in this case the centre of the issue.

But what is the liberal multicultural argument against it? Why can't they say it's racism, imperialism to stop them doing it? It isn't hurting anyone outside of their culture. They've done it for hundreds of years. It's their tradition. On what authority does anyone have to tell them their culture is wrong?
 
Obviously I can see it's wrong but that's by my cultures standards.
 
To just say democracy implies morality is majority rule. To oppose it has to be to a degree opposed to multiculturalism and to want to impose Western ideas. I don't see anyway round that.
 
 
&gt; It might. And I won’t like that even as a staunch advocate that these people should be fine to live here. As for the white liberal atheists telling them what to do? Sure there will be push back but a lot of traditions are lost with subsequent generations living in a more liberalised society.
 
I see this but to me this is the assimilation path which multiculturalism policy was chosen exactly to avoid.
 
Instead of “come here and your traditions will be respected” it is “come where the stuff we don’t like will be suppressed and oppressed out of you.” It’s dishonest.
It takes liberalism for granted as the cultural universal, rational and obvious path to civilization.
 
The reality is mixed some people strongly assimilate and some people have a reverse reaction becoming more traditional.
 
Oddly the liberal side will then present the most Westernised Liberal migrant as an example of multiculturalism. When they are an example of assimilation not multiculturalism.
 
Now selfishly I want people to assimilate to Western Social Liberalism because I am a Western Social Liberal. But i can’t not see the realities.
 
&gt; Our European sensibilities have recently undergone a paradigm shift liberating the LGBTQ+ communities and loosening of abortion laws. Why not them? 

The change on sexual minorities comes after long term trends within Western Culture. Reactions to the Western phenomena of fascism and War War 2, the breakdown in industrial states of the extended family and the replacement of the state and insurance for welfare in place of the family.
 
Yet prejudice in Western societies remains. It is not complete. In that sense I think liberals often interpret tolerance as celebration and integration.

&gt; With time I believe that FGM will fade but I don’t think that means we should choose the route of inaction.
 
But you do think the numbers will go up?
 
&gt; There is a balance to be struck here and if there are people believing that we’re pussyfooting around the subject they may have merit - especially with those abysmal prosecution numbers (0) for FGM cases.
 
&gt; Perhaps implementing what some gun-control advocates would like in the US; where if an underage or mentally unstable person acquires a gun and uses it, the parents should be prosecuted for negligence, but in this case it would be where an FGM victim is discovered, this could work.
 
I just don’t think it’s even as easy as that.
 
The community do not think they are doing anything wrong.
 
This is an outside community trying to police another community into abandoning it’s tradition. This isn’t self policing like it is mostly on gun ownership in the US.
 
The liberal West does not have the stomach for being those white liberal atheists telling traditional religion brown people that they are doing it all wrong.
 
&gt; This however might drive these victims further ‘underground’ so to speak. So this is a difficult subject where the solution should not be ‘leave them to their own devices’ or ‘throw everyone remotely involved in prison or deport them.’
 
We clearly have left them. We have not gotten into the awkward political realities of this yet.

&gt; Residing in the boogie down Bronx, Rob has been devoted to music since he was a kid, maintaining a deep connection to it in multiple forms (The Beatles, The Stones, Melle Mel, Run DMC, Kraftwerk, The Soul Sonic Force, The Talking Heads, Zeppelin, BDP, Public Enemy, Muddy Waters, UltraMagnetic MC’s, The Clash, Devo, Goblin, David Bowie, EPMD). He developed his expressive abilities through grinding for 10 + years in New York City, living life in a way unique to the New York experience – hard fought, hard luck, high stress and no money tempered by huge dreams. In 2000, Rob gained critical acclaim as the front man of the group Sonic Sum, who’s album The Sanity Annex won rave reviews in the U.S., Europe and Japan, with SPIN magazine voting it the “2nd Best Album of the Year that No One Heard”. Kudos rolled in from publications such as The Source, The Wire, XXL, NME, Urb (Next 100), and CMJ. Word got around and soon came offers from artists like DJ Krush and Funkstorung to get down on their albums, a collaboration with Slug (Atmosphere) and Mike Ladd, plus shout outs from Radiohead, Bobbito Garcia, Autechre and others. Rob also loves spaghetti and happened to share the same management as Def Jux honcho El-P, and a friendship, as well as mutual artistic respect, formed. In 2003, Rob signed with the label, asking only for the opportunity to make a record with his heart, mind and soul, hence, Telicatessen. And it’s all we could have ever asked for.

I assume you don't support Catalonian independence nor see it as likely. What is the harm then of a vote on it, if it lacks support as you say it won't happen, it'll be voted down.

My problem is in having a vote for everything and deciding on how much should count for a result. These days everything should be voted apparently, people have this desire to be heard, and yet, humans keep proving we aren't qualified to make most decisions on a populace level, we still vote to much with our hearts and not with our heads. Then there's the problem of how many should vote yes for it to count: you might say 50% since it's the majority but in this case I'm not sure (has I wasn't with Brexit), it seems to little for such an important issue, but my opinion on that matter is irrelevant.

What I see from your numbers is a below 50% turnout for a very important referendum which tells me less than half are concerned about it. You might say it's because there is pressure for the people to not go and vote, in which case I ask for a census or inquiry of credible nature that clearly shows this ""clear desire for a referendum"" you're talking about. This links with the regional results, the margins are just to small and believing the numbers that only half the populace cares about this enough to go out and vote, then this tells me a lot of people are voting on parties primarily because of other issues (justice, wealth, security, health, transportation, environment, etc.) and not primarily for the stance on independence, which makes the results on this matter less important.

You're right in that I would rather see a united Spain, it's better IMO for the peninsula and EU has a whole, but in the end it's still up to the people, if I'm shown numbers that prove a true desire for independence, well fundamented reasons I would be willing to accept it.",True,False,False,,0,1538486631,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e70yuw9,False,t3_9kk9bq,True,t1_e70uo8s,/r/europe/comments/9kk9bq/the_catalan_parliament_tonight/e70yuw9/,,1539947269,0,True,False,europe,t5_2qh4j,r/europe,public,

&gt; BRUSSELS - Russia must halt its covert development of a banned cruise missile system or the United States will seek to destroy it before it becomes operational, Washington&amp;#039;s envoy to NATO said on Tuesday.

&gt; The United States believes Russia is developing a ground-launched system in breach of a Cold War treaty that could allow Russia to launch a nuclear strike on Europe at short notice, but Moscow has consistently denied any such violation.

&gt; &amp;quot;We have been trying to send a message to Russia for several years that we know they are violating the treaty, we have shown Russia the evidence that we have that they are violating the treaty,&amp;quot; Hutchison said.

What can we do?

One of the things is definitely spreading awareness. As you are doing right now, but perhaps in the form of posting well thought out, articulate articles and pieces, especially that [petition that has been signed by inumerable scientists that oppose the implementation of 5G](https://www.5gappeal.eu/) - please link this everywhere (if you are a scientist, please contact them and add your signature).

Another thing we can do is help people become more aware of their bodies and the sensations within them. If people become more aware, they will feel more deeply and thus they will also feel radiowaves more deeply. The ordinary person that is totally out of touch with themselves on all levels, including physically from their own bodies, can be harmed by toxic chemicals in the water, air, GMOs and harmful electromagnetic radation - yet may not feel much until they suddenly develop a serious illness after a few years of exposure (such as cancer). In the mean time they might be plagued by headaches, fatigue, brain fog....yet never attribute it to these harmful elements in our environment.
The more I became aware of my body, the more I have been able to feel these waves. Thus I immediately saw that Wi-Fi was causing me fatigue and making me feel like I was plugged into an electrical outlet - thus I stopped using it and am now using Internet via USB tethering (and will perhaps soon simply get a regular wired cable connection, though I am on laptop so it is easier via tethering atm).

Speak out and don't be shy. Anyone that wishes to help can do so by getting educated on the dangers and speaking out.

False,AaHiDKilleR,1519219564.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_l8syrqh,,"If you want to know precisely how Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde is feeling right now, it's really very simple.
Do you remember that time you cautiously decided to go back out on a date with your ex, knowing that ""there lies trouble""? Or the moment when, after a couple of gym sessions, that extra slice of cheesecake with cream that everyone else was having at dinner suckered you into eating it? That last drink that you truly fancy, despite an inner voice telling you ""No!""?
The results? A blistering reminder of why you two broke up in the first place, a couple of pounds extra on the scales when you dare to look and a thumping headache at work on Monday morning. 

We all know the story.
And Valverde? Those nagging voices in his head during the summer whispering seductively: ""You've got to give the Barca purists more entertainment"" and ""The president is going to demand that his €120 million plaything called Ousemane Dembele is on the team sheet every week"" -- that's his equivalent of the ""Oh, go on, then!"" via which you get into partner/cheesecake/tequila trouble.

Those voices persuaded him to drop his four-man midfield wrecking crew of 2017-18 and try out this term's three in the middle and three up front.
The Basque coach, a 4-3-3 winger by trade, choked the living daylights out of La Liga last season. 

Valverde knew damn well that, for a variety of reasons, both Andres Iniesta and Sergio Busquets would be a million times happier and more efficient if they were constantly accompanied by two further midfielders.
For the past 15 years, Barca have re-branded themselves, become vastly successful and, in bursts, played some of the greatest football ever seen by mankind via a 4-3-3 formation. 

However it's a devilishly difficult system to get right, particularly if the guys above you keep buying the wrong types of footballers -- and abandon any real pretence that they care about homegrowing them.
So last season's Blaugrana midfield -- typically Ivan Rakitic, Busquets, Paulinho and Iniesta, but with niceties including Philippe Coutinho or Sergio Roberto -- was built for solidity. The midfield trio, for years a jaunty, exhilarating, sexy, open-top sports car became a Volvo. But it worked. Domestically at least, nobody managed to wrest either enough control or enough quality of space in order to damage Barca significantly.

If Jordi Alba and the right-back pushed up and/or Lionel Messi dropped deep, Valverde's side had the kind of total domination, choke-hold control of the middle of the pitch that meant that Gerard Pique and Samuel Umtiti, had they so chosen, could have played most La Liga or Copa del Rey matches wearing a velvet smoking jacket, a ruffled cravat and puffing on a massive Cuban cigar.

The purists were unhappy. Paulinho was treated, at least by the media and a core part of the fan base, like some guy at a wedding reception who nobody felt they knew but everybody was too timid to ask to leave. The swamping of midfield worked in terms of efficacy, but not aesthetics. Nor did it function in Europe.
Luis Suarez floundered without a winger in the 4-4-2 system. He hasn't scored away from home in the Champions League for three years.

Those teams that confronted the Catalan club with ultra-high-energy aggression and runners in behind the four-man midfield -- or long balls over the top like Roma constantly used when knocking them out of the Champions League -- found a way to negate the midfield superiority of numbers: a remedy to the tactic.

So, think like Valverde. What to do?
Messi remains, unquestionably, the Sun King of Barcelona. He plays virtually every minute. By the Argentine's command, Suarez does too.

If Dembele is someone that the board who funded his vastly expensive transfer demand to see playing, then there's your regular three up front -- hands tied. It's also a fair point that Dembele wouldn't be able to show the stuff he's stupendous at, or sand down the rough edges in his football savvy, unless he's playing most weeks. Learning by doing.
Three up front either means three in midfield or, if four in the centre is vital, then three at the back.

The 3-4-3 was, too, largely the shape that Johan Cruyff's Dream Team favoured -- there are precedents elsewhere in La Liga and also at the Camp Nou. That's for sure. Frank Rijkaard tried it occasionally while Barca coach -- to occasionally horrible results.	

If anything, that 3-4-3 formation is still more eclectic -- full of the best and worst. Functioning well, it can literally transfix opposition, frightening the living daylights out of them, presenting ""overs"" of 5-v-3 or worse in attacking situations. On a day when the central pivot midfielder is pressed and robbed, when passes go astray, when the wing-backs or wide midfielders don't do their job positionally, you can be torn to shreds and look like a fancy pants who couldn't spell the word ""defence"" or find a dictionary via which to look it up.

Valverde knows now, after the embarrassments of home draws to Girona and Athletic Bilbao plus the lifeless defeat to Leganes, that his 4-3-3 experiment can't work. Or at least not without a few unlesses:

It can't work unless Busquets is on absolutely top form mentally, athletically and technically. It can't work unless Rakitic is given time and respite to cope with the massive overload of playing well over 4,000 minutes for his club last season plus all the way through to his first World Cup final in the summer. It can't work unless Dembele learns to press, to tackle and to track back with massively more diligence than right now. 

It can't work unless Coutinho, as almost a guaranteed member of that three-man midfield, gives the ball away less often, wins possession more often and, generally, presses with more success -- all of which he's capable of.
Above all, it can't work if Barcelona want to win La Liga and the Champions League.

Much of the focus on Barcelona's defending this season has been on individual failings. Did Pique doze off? How did Umtiti or Clement Lenglet get themselves sent off in such a manner? Was Busquets any use while filling in for Lenglet against Girona before Umtiti came on to steady the ship? Shouldn't Marc-Andre ter Stegen have roared a warning to Pique against Leganes that there was a completely unmarked opponent streaking in to pick off any fluffed clearance and that the Catalan should have stabbed the ball directly out for a corner? Has Thomas Vermaelen forgotten how to jump? Where the hell was the offside line against Athletic while the Basques went 0-1 up at the weekend?

And on and on it goes. There were extenuating circumstances in most of those errors, though -- and what's more, most of the analysis missed a crucial point.

What's a fact is that Barcelona have been risking this high-wire defensive act for a few seasons. As Xavi departed and Iniesta aged and Busquets had fewer like-minded players around him -- thus often had his lack of pace exposed -- Barcelona's defence got used to anarchic situations. Their strikers wouldn't press or track, the midfield got over-run and the defence carried the can.

One-v-one or even one-v-two defending against counter-attacks, again and again. Being swamped because, athletically, Barcelona's midfield couldn't track back properly if any pass was misplaced. That was one of the main reasons for Valverde's switch to four men in the centre of the pitch last season -- and for him winning his debut league title.

Particularly with a tricky next four weeks containing tests against Tottenham, Valencia, Sevilla, Inter Milan twice and, let's not forget, the Clasico against Real Madrid at the Camp Nou, it's unquestionably time for Barcelona's manager to pick one of two options: Either risk 3-4-3, the footballing equivalent of poker's all-in bet where you put every remaining betting chip on your decision, or he can accept that he got it right last season, tell his critics to go to hell and revert to the 4-4-2 (this time with the excellent Arthur giving Rakitic a rest) which won him trophies, if not fans, last season.",True,False,False,,0,1538491975,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e714jfc,False,t3_9kd4d5,False,t1_e714hq2,/r/Barca/comments/9kd4d5/open_thread_art_photos_videos_general_questions/e714jfc/,,1539949953,9,True,False,Barca,t5_2s561,r/Barca,public,

And even then, americas role in the world is still ultimately self interested. It is in americas interest to be the worlds police man. they didnt invade iraq and Afghanistan because they selflessly wanted to give democracy and prosperity to the local populations, they did it because they calculated that a prosperous democracy was less likely to produce terrorists that hate the us than a poor autocracy (nevermind that they failed miserably, or that cheney lied about iraq, this was the reason the wars were approved of by the population and the security establishment.). 

Same with the Marshal plan. A unified, prosperous europe would be less likely to pull america into another world war, and would be a powerful ally in the perceived threat from soviet russia.

The one *barely* accepted use of nuclear weapons in international law is second strike deterrence capability. That is, it's acceptable to retaliate in the event of an enemy nuclear strike, and since the time for ICBMs to get from USSR to the mainland US is at least half an hour, there is a window to react. 

But there has to be an actual case of nuclear aggression. If you see an enemy bomber on the horizon, you can't just go all ""I guess it's a nuclear bomber, let's get those Pershings on the Moscow express"". This is not just a bureaucratic point - the person making the decision to retaliate (or intervene, RIP Stanislav Petrov) has to consider all manner of consequences in the case of a false launch. 

However, it was assumed that a Soviet attack on the US would come simultaneously with one in Europe. In this case there really isn't the time for cooler heads to react - so the INF Treaty was born, which made sure that if Soviets ever launch some rockets into Europe those are just Scuds and nothing to worry about (well, comparatively speaking). 

Well guess what, there's no Europe in China. If China ever launched a first strike on the US, it would come from the mainland and mostly through the window between Taiwan and Japan - and it would take the usual time to get there. That would look nothing like an AShBM attack mainly from Hainan and Guangdong on a carrier group mainly to the south (other parts of SSC are in range of shorter range missiles), when ships would start keeling over in minutes from perfectly ordinary explosions. 

Meanwhile China is very publicly announcing a number of things - that they commit to no first strike policy, they want everyone to stay out of the nine dash line and they have really *a lot* of AShBMs in range of all of it. 

It's perfectly obvious to everyone, including the unfortunate commander of that hypothetical navy, that no nuclear weapons are going to be used in that situation unless someone digs Douglas McArthur back up.

That genetic reality is *somewhat* ambiguous, and has messy borders. A ""white"" person is a person of ethnic European descent, a ""black"" person is a person of ethnic African descent.

&amp;#x200B;

By ""messy borders"" I mean that questions such as ""is a person of 74% English and 26% west African"" descent a ""white person""?"" are hard to answer, because these categories are to some extent constructed (as all categories are). However whereas most people of a Progressive slant will say ""the borders of these categories are messy, therefore they don't exist and are meaningless"", I see it as more akin to the color spectrum. Namely that the PRECISE line between red and orange for example is impossible to define, it is impossible to say at exactly what HUE red becomes orange, but that doesn't mean that red and orange are therefore not real.

&amp;#x200B;

I think racial categories are the same, they have messy borders but describe in broad terms a genetic reality based on divergent evolution and geographic separation.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't object to study based on the prejudices or attitudes of various groups. What I object to is the cynical and evasive way that progressives (who are hugely over-represented in these types of studies and the social sciences in general) change their attitudes towards the legitimacy of racial categorization based on the outcome of the study.

&amp;#x200B;

If a study reflects negatively on whites, suddenly whites are a legitimate racial category worthy of study.

&amp;#x200B;

If a study reflects positively on whites, all of a sudden ""race is a social construct"", ""you can't define exactly where a ""white person"" begins and a ""black person"" ends, therefore the categories are meaningless"", ""the racial categorization of humans is a long-discredited racialist trope"", ""white doesn't exist, instead we should discuss European ethnicities"" etc.

There are very well organized extremist groups out there, what do you think they would do if they had a nuke? This is ridiculous ethnocentric whataboutism.

Aren't we focusing on politics in the U.S. and college campuses in the U.S.? How is this remotely ethnocentric? Also, far more people in the world die from heart attacks than Islamic terrorism, if you want to take out the US aspect.

&gt; They don't care about college students ""speaking out"". They care about college students who want to control what other college students are allowed to hear.

No, they care about college students preventing conservatives from speaking at schools. Hence why Sam and Ben haven't said anything about Chelsea Manning. As for your contention that they ""care about college students who want to control what other college students are allowed to hear,"" shouldn't those some people be concerned about right wing organizations that are trying to control what college students hear from their teachers, a la Turning Point USA?

&gt; The difference is that Manning was considered for a form of employment by the academic institutions of the school. In contrast, right wing speakers who have been deplatformed are often invited to private events by student organizations. They are not endorsed by the school in the same way that someone who is given a visiting fellowship would be.

Bullshit. That is 100% bullshit. If the Grand Wizard of the KKK was speaking at Harvard, you think that it would not seem like Harvard was endorsing the KKK? That's quite a ridiculous distinction there.

&gt; I'm not defending repulicans in any way. The entire party is a joke at this stage. Two wrongs don't make a right, I was specifically talking about liberals deplatforming.

Of course you're not. But, you do seem to care more about college students protesting certain speakers than a Congressperson saying that a school should lose their government funding if they allow a certain person to speak on their campus. Which do you believe is a bigger issue?

&gt; You're not sticking to the subject here. We are specifically discussing deplatforming on college campuses, and you claimed Sam was hypocritical for not calling out deplatforming from the right. Please don't change the goal posts. I brought out the statistics to demonstrate that deplatforming attempts from the right are getting more rare every year, and that they don't happen in any sort of similar magnitude.

What is the difference between students protesting speakers and outside organizations with no affiliations with a school publicly advocating for teachers of those schools being removed?

&gt; Doesn't it bother you that group 2 seems to be growing? I can't for the life of me understand how you can sweep this under the rug and pretend it's nothing to worry about.

I genuinely don't think either is remotely an issue worth addressing whatsoever. Maybe in passing you could say, ""Did you see that some students at ABC college protested the dude who said that lesbians are dykes and should be killed and then doxed a student on the campus."" But, besides that I believe that it is basically a non-issue that is made into a big issue so the right can start hand wringing about the freedom of speech and how liberals are just blue-haired, pussy hat, overweight, college-aged lesbians who only care about hating white men and cry when their feelings are hurt.

I love the game but I don't understand how you can go to prestige 50 with the current lack of content. It's not to blame crytek, but the game needs a mode that pushes you to play more (like R6, CS ranked or anything else). The crafting thing might be a good thing to improve that, but still, it would need to be pushed as far as EFT does (with quests and all) to make it last longer.

My main concern about the game is the hate for casual ""whiteshirts"" . A game needs casual players to live, and yet everyone insults any idea going in this direction. Hunt will die hardly if crytek only listen to hardcore gamers. I have high hopes for elo system which could help casuals playing. But the current system of the game (2 winners/8 losers at best) will never help casual players.

The balancing thing is okay for me, I expect a lot of fails on it, that's the only way to find problems.

False,Seed_Eater,1321220985.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_68jx2,,"Syndicalism is more a method of organizing socialism both pre-and post-revolution. The core concept is placing the workplace and capital, not political parties, at the center of socialist action. The main vehicle of syndicalism is workers' unions or councils. The plan is to establish a general workers' union that can be organized across all industries and workplaces and will effectively control production, allowing the union to call a mass strike or simply take control of industry as a means of overturning capitalism. 

The primary difference between anarchism, Marxism, and syndicalism, is that syndicalism seeks to replace the political state with an economic democracy, using the established trade union structure to plan economy. It does not reject political incursions, and in fact several Marxist syndicalist organisations hosted both a syndicalist union and an accompanying political party that existed to hamper efforts to disarm or undermine the union. Typically though the political party takes a back seat to the union. Syndicalism flourished in Europe during the height of trade union power in Italy, France, Spain, and Germany. The trade unions attempted to act all as governing bodies, militias, workplace advocates, and revolutionaries.

Anarcho-syndicalism, which developed after the ""revolutionary syndicalism"" of the 1900s-1920s, is the most popular current of syndicalism and uses the basic organizing premise to achieve anarchism. This differs from revolutionary syndicalism in that it uses the methods, but not necessarily the goals, of it and seeks to overturn capitalism through the empowerment of radical democratic unions, such as the IWW, CNT, or OBU. In practice it is simply a more libertarian version of rev. syndicalism. It typically rejects the political involvement of Marxist syndicalism.

Syndicalism developed parallel to but separate from Marxism and anarchism, but was heavily integrated into both before the 1930s. After the 40s, it really only exists in anarcho-syndicalist organisations, as the necessity and ability for syndicalists to be politically involved became trivial.",True,False,False,,0,1538498858,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e71cras,False,t3_9krice,False,t3_9krice,/r/Socialism_101/comments/9krice/syndicalism/e71cras/,,1539953763,29,True,False,Socialism_101,t5_2ys9x,r/Socialism_101,public,

If you get sanctioned and disagree with it, that’s pretty tough cus they don’t really over turn them. You will only get one if the evidence is there, and if it’s there they won’t over turn it.

Yes, I believe that you can report people for breaking rules in a game and the Microsoft enforcement team reviews it.

Also, remember we have wildly different cultures between countries BUT we can all work in harmony.

Oddly enough, people can work together easily despite the colour of their skin. We are all people.

The 'American subsidises EU defence' is also a bullshit lie. What is the US protecting Europe from? A couple of thousand people in Germany aren't doing shit. What about the UK which has no American bases. How can they afford healthcare AND defending themselves still?

Which leads me onto my next point; the US government actually spends more per capita on healthcare than any other country in the world. You do have money there for a social healthcare system.

When you look at 'crime per capita', it doesn't matter the population so saying ""Sweden is enjoying a lower crime rate due to a smaller population"" isn't really a good argument. 

And Europe is seeing crimes across the board fall. Note how the increase in 'rape' is mostly down to better reporting. Every single country has seen a rise in the 'rape reporting' rape. It is not such much rape is rising more than more people are confident enough to report when rape has occurred.

---

Four-year-old Kiera Pulaski died in Republic in 2010, about three months after her 18-month-old brother Darby Hodges died in Montana. Authorities could not find wrongdoing and left the cause of each death undetermined, though law enforcement continued to investigate.

Cheryl Hodges, whose son Tom Hodges was Darby's father and Kiera's stepfather, told the News-Leader last month she hoped the show would rejuvenate investigations into the deaths.

Cheryl and Tom Hodges went on the Dr. Phil show looking for answers, Cheryl Hodges said.

Also on the show were the children's mother, Julia Cummings and her now-husband Codey Cummings. They were caring for the children at the time of the children's deaths.

*  The medical examiner wrote that Darby died of an undetermined cause and manner. It says he had **multiple contusions and abrasions on his head, mild brain swelling and two broken ribs.**

*  According to Kiera's autopsy, her ""adult guardians"" said she had fallen in the bathroom when she lost her footing.

*  The autopsy showed a **""large subdural hematoma,""** or a collection of blood on the brain, which the medical examiner noted didn't appear to match the explanation of Kiera's fall. ""This was a significant degree of trauma and appears disproportionate to fall as described in the narrative.""

*  Also revealed were a series of **bruises on the chin, shoulders and back, and scars on the leg.**

* ""This is suggestive of but not conclusive for possible abusive treatment. The manner of death is, pending additional information, inconclusive.""

Wilcox said previously that Republic police were aware Darby had died a few months before Kiera and that ""the circumstances surrounding the death of the two children had various similarities.""

Perhaps you can read my original statement? It's been almost thirty years since the fall of the Soviet Union, and how many wars have occurred within the EU?

Further, there are important differences between North America and Europe and the NAFTA and the ECSC.

First, NA does not have the same history of warfare as Europe. This is due several factors, but primary due to the American Union - or the United States of America.

Second, the NAFTA and the ECSC. The ECSC does two things. It reduces the need for domestic natural resources, and it disperses industry.

Together, these make war within the Union unneeded and effectively impossible.

sarà una deformazione professionale, ma queste cose mi triggerano.

non funziona così! sarebbe così se avessi un confronto con un mondo parallelo uguale al nostro a meno dell'unione europea. a quel punto potremmo confrontare gli andamenti e capire se l'EU ha fatto salire o scendere la disoccupazione.

il tasso di disoccupazione da solo non dice NULLA. potrebbe benissimo essere che senza EU sarebbe aumentato il doppio, o rimasto uguale. dall'andamento di una variabile sola, in un sistema dove le variabili sono tante (o tantissime come in questo caso) non puoi ottenere nulla. la temperatura dell'aria è un'altra variabile a caso, altrettanto inutile senza un'analisi statistica completa (che ne proverebbe l'inutilità)... tanto per fare un esempio la disoccupazione negli ultimi 50-ish anni è aumentata in un sacco di posti anche fuori dall'europa.

per capire se l'EU ha fatto bene o male all'occupazione bisogna fare un'analisi complessa che tenga conto di più variabili possibile, in modo da capire quali influenzano il livello di occupazione (e sono sicuramente dozzine, non solo l'EU), e quali no. io non l'ho fatto, perchè non conosco abbastanza nè l'economia nè la statistica. l'unico fatto che mi porta a dire che l'EU dà più opportunità è che il mercato del lavoro in cui posso buttarmi diventa molto più grande (e questo è indibattibile). non è un caso che un accademico liberista come monti sia pro EU (qui si parla da un punto di vista puramente economico). in teoria, mercato più grande= più competizione = più crescita , e questo dal loro punto di vista è una regola sempre vera. io personalmente non sono così d'accordo con le teorie del liberismo economico totale, ma non mi sento abbastanza esperto da fare una critica informata a quello che dice monti.

 Dota 2

* Team Spirit v Odium - Team Odium recently played very well against NiP. Under Lil captaining, I think they are even more able to take down a game from Team Spirit. **Team Odium +1.5**
* Infamous v Team Foreign - Team Foreign is a brand new team vs a very very experienced team Infamous. Of course the odds here are very low but I'm taking it cause why not? Adds more odds to our parlay! **Team Infamous -1.5**

CSGO

 

* NiP v Heroic - This one is quite hard but I'm taking my chances on NiP seeing as Heroic have to play quite a lot of games today it will be matter of Heroic's mentality to be able to keep their attention to play against NiP for 2 games. **NiP -0.5**
*  MIBR v Gorilla Gang - Same deal with the Infamous vs Team Foreign, however Gorilla Gang is a tad maybe an opponent vs MiBR as MiBR are testing how well they jell together as a team. I'm still taking my chances with Made in HALF Brazillians. **MiBR -1.5**

&amp;#x200B;

Well Germany is in a energie wende trying to change to more enviromental friendly energy. Thats why money is invested into that. Now maybe you havent noticed that takes time.. Then why all the coal you say? Well have you heard of nuclear powerplants and how they are beeing closed in germany due to a political decision on that? Well the energy gotta come from somewhere. Thats why germany is using coal. Its bad i know and we can dissagree on it, buts its how the rational is.

Then your stupid emissionstests, thats about cars and the car industry. I kinda dont know what Merkel has to do on that, but here it goes. You know they were sued right? Also so did Nissan, Mercedes, Renault, Jeep and crysler but hey yeah we need to keep focusing on only Merkel.

&amp;#x200B;

Aww Mrs. Merkel she's so nice and testing, no she isn't she sells weapons to dictators who use them on civilians the monster fucking bastard arms dealing bitch. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ask a Syrian about Obama, America colluded with head-chopping,car-bombing, child-raping Jihadis under his rule. The fucking monster. I don't care how cool he is, his foreign policy was monstrous

&amp;#x200B;

Citation needed. I know Obama did some shitty stuff in foreign policy, but he did some good as well. As there were regulations on drone strikes and the Iran nuclear deal.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Trump actually stopped this stupid militia strategy so fair fucks to the cunt for that, he's still an arms dealer though. 

&amp;#x200B;

yes he is and he increased the armsdealing noticibly. Also removed restrictions on drone strikes who are now noticibly inceased in Africa.

&amp;#x200B;

Germany portray themselves as the self righteous anti war nation who stand up to the sauds.

Well and it looked like they would, except it shows that german arms industry is in the supply chain of other arms dealer(cough US) who have already pledged supply. Thus by backing out they would have been sued and the german gov. would have paid. A explanation at least. I know they should have taken the hit, but now they are just as bad as everyone else who would have thought. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm speaking specifically of Germany's government but the emissions tests, the Greece issue, playing the environmental champions while being the biggest carbon users in Europe all make Germany look terrible in my opinion, deceitful, untrustworthy, dishonest partners

&amp;#x200B;

So when you said ""Germany is a thoroughly dishonest nation, don't trust the Germans they will deceive you.""

So you did mean the gouverment on not like i dunno the nation as the germans. Because you could have used the word gouverment and not nation as you clearly are a english speaker.

The emissions test are about the car industry and not about the germans or the german gouverment

The Greece issue is about the EU and its policies. Yes germany was the driver in the fiscal policy but not alone also what thats about anything? I could likewise say what about the UK and its internal corruption.

playing the environmental champions while being the biggest carbon users in Europe, well germany is a industry nation. 

It is not suprising that they are the biggest carbon users and change takes time. They are shutting down nuclear facilities and are building and using more renewable but shit building infrastructure takes years and building down industry is not a option.

In the UK we have direct action groups that literally destroy factories and we have pressure groups such as stop the arms trade. In Germany some irrelevant powerless politicians say stuff and have no effect.

There were some protest but to few as in germany there are other problems at the moment. No excuse i know but thats how it is. Also good on you if some weaponsites were destroyed, i couldnt fint that anywhere though.

4. They nationalized a lot of industries: actually, they were one of the only countries in Europe moving towards privatization at the time.

5. They had a welfare state: yes, that's true, but that existed before Hitler was in power, Hitler actually hated the welfare state, saying it costs too much, but he knew that if he got rid of it thered probably be a revolution against him, so instead he removed it for non aryans to cut costs.

Semitic languages, like Hebrew and Arabic, tend to use triliteral roots. Basically, whereas Indo-European languages tend to operate on a system of root words, prefixes, and suffixes, they have series of 2-4 consonants as root words, and either change vowels or occasionally add affixes. For example, KTB is a root that tends to be about writing, and in Arabic, KaTaBa means ""he wrote"", while KuTiBa means ""he/it was written"". (This is also the case in Egyptian, which is a separate branch of Afro-Asiatic, although I don't know if this applies to Berber, Chadic, Cushitic, and Omotic languages)

The Hebrew and Arabic alphabets are properly called abjads. This means that consonants get their own letters, while vowels are semi-optional diacritics. In modern times, they tend to only be written in texts for children and language-learners or in religious texts. The former, because they can't infer vowels yet, and the latter, because it could be too vague.

And the Yahweh reconstruction is based primarily on theophoric elements in names and transcriptions into other languages, like Greek, which had full alphabets.

Good thing for someone with SA about working at a warehouse is that there are planty of jobs there where you don't have to interact with people if you don't want to. You can just focus on your job and your bosses will think that you are a hard worker. Work is boring but there are many different tasks you can do and if you have experience (that you will get with time) and good opinion you can easily switch between them.

Warehouses have many different shifts to offer, morning, late, night shifts, 4 on 4 off, any 5 of 7 days, 8 hour, 10, 12 per day - different warehouse, different rules. Morning shifts often start quite early at 6am.

1.5 hour commute seems long, I don't know where you live but at this time of the year there are plenty of work in the ecomm business (cause of black Friday and Christmas coming) so there should be plenty of job openings in other warehouses that may be closer to where you live.

Pra pro setor produtivo do ramo propriamente, não adianta dolar alto pra ter preço melhor de venda, se o preço dos insumos também sobe junto. E na real quando o dolar sobe digamos 10% num período, a cotação de digamos um saco de soja, não sobe 10%, a base do preço é Chicago mas na prática o preço real pago depende da demanda naquele momento exato, e demora pra organizar uma compra e agendar navio granaleiro no porto (Só pra encher navio atracado leva 7 dias, imagina o prazo total entre pegar isso nos armazéns espalhados pelo país, levar pro porto, encher navio, atravessar 5 mares com o navio, descarregar no outro porto, e transportar até a industria de beneficiamento que comprou o produto!).

Agora mesmo estamos numa situação ruim porque em janeiro-abril quando boa parte da safra brasileira foi colhida (Soja e milho, o resto é pouco comparado a esses) o dolar estava baixo, então automaticamente o preço do cereal estava menor. Mas agora em agosto-outubro quando tem que comprar adubo e cia pra preparar o plantio da próxima safra, com o dolar MUITO alto, o preço desses insumos também está altíssimo! Se lá por fevereiro quando essa safra for colhida o dolar estiver baixo de novo, pessoal vai tomar muito prejuízo! Pegou dolar alto na hora de comprar insumos, mas vai ter dolar baixo na hora de vender a produção.

E se o dolar estiver alto em fevereiro, não necessariamente o preço será tão bom, já que o custo de produção foi mais alto. Como a China não é atrelada ao dolar eles pagam preços menores pro soja brasileiro, US$ 10 por bushel de soja em Chicago, com dolar a R$ 4, é fácil resultar em venda Brasil&gt;China no equivalente a R$ 38 por bushel (E não R$ 40 como o dolar diria). O dolar tá junto com o Euro geralmente, então nossas vendas pra Roterdã (Segundo maior destino do soja, depois da China) tem melhora, mas pra China nem tanto. Já a importação de insumos usa muita coisa do báltico e região, especialmente Ucrânia e Russia, o cambio em relação a eles também varia meio próximo ao do dolar, mas é descolado, é 1 centavo de diferença aqui e ali mas com o tamanho dos números da produção as vezes isso resulta em R$ 100 milhões LIQUIDO a menos no setor, é a diferença entre ter lucro ou trabalhar de graça (Só empurrar com a barriga, ir dilapidando capital esperando anos melhores pela frente).

O mercado de carne ainda tem muito exportador pequeno (A JBS domina, mas no mercado do soja tem 6 ou 7 equivalentes a JBS, é bem mais concorrido), tem atrelagem ao dolar, por conta de mercados tipo Arabia Saudita e Israel, mas temos muitas vendas pra Europa (Euro tá em situação um pouco melhor), e pessoal tipo Irã, Egito e Russia, nesse caso dolar alto veio acompanhado pela desvalorização das moedas desses países, então os preços pra exportação não subiram muito, mas o consumo deles caiu. Basicamente a gente não está ganhando quase nada a mais, mas eles estão pagando muito a mais, a desvalorização pegou o Real mas pegou ainda mais feio a moeda do Irã e da Russia. Nesse mercado só quem eu vi muito feliz ultimamente é o pessoal aqui perto que exporta pra Israel, a situação é tão favorável que eles dizem que com 3d de trabalho no abate halal pra Israel o lucro bruto paga as despesas dos funcionários no mês todo! Se tiver que diminuir escala eles poderão fazer tranquilamente, sem reduzir salários, enquanto os importadores israelenses continuarem no mesmo ritmo de compra. Esse pessoal também vende pra outros mercados, onde o preço mal paga os custos, então tem que ir dosando as vendas, sacrificar o mercado menos lucrativo quando for preciso, porque esses mercados não dão conta de pagar o preço que o dolar ditaria, tem que fazer negociação a parte, senão não conseguem comprar.

False,Pakka-Makka,1534083199.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_1yyo51bs,,"&gt;Now it’s official. A new report by Pew Research conclusively proves that Israel is Trumpland. Most of the world, especially its democratic part, is wary of the U.S. president, but for Israelis, everything seems dandy.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Among the 25 countries included in Pew’s latest Survey of Global Attitudes and Trends, Israel is in second place in its confidence in Trump’s ability to manage the world, closely behind the Philippines, led by our newfound buddy and alleged mass murderer Rodrigo Duterte.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Israelis trust Trump more than anyone in the world to look out for their country’s interests. And only in Israel is support for Trump actually increasing, by leaps and bounds.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Outside the Israeli bubble, the world’s confidence in American leadership is collapsing, especially when compared to the latter years of Barack Obama’s tenure as president. Confidence in the U.S. president has plummeted from 83%-25% in Canada, from 86% to 10% in Germany, from 84% to 9% in France from 75% to 7% in Spain and so on. Even Israel’s new ethnocentric and authoritarian Eastern European allies registered a sharp drop in trust in the U.S. president, in Poland from 58% to 35% and in Viktor Orban’s Hungary from 58% to 31%.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Only in Israel did trust in the U.S. presidency jump from 49%, when it was last measured by Pew in 2016, to 69% support for Trump today, at a rate matched by only one sector of Western European politics, which deserves mention: The far right.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Once again, the biblical curse of Balaam from the Book of Numbers - considered a blessing by many Jewish sages - of Israel as “a people that dwell alone and shall not be reckoned among the nations”, is manifested for all to see. Apparently things that we can see from here, in the center of the Middle East cauldron, can’t be seen from there, in the hallways of most of the world’s capitals. Only we can truly understand Trump and appreciate his positive leadership that lies behind the smoke screen of his deficiencies and scandals.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;In Israeli eyes, and in Israeli eyes only, the change from Obama to Trump is an improvement, not a disaster. And the fact that hypocritical Europe, weakly Canada, detached Australia or delusional Latin America are united in their disdain for Trump is proof positive, according to local logic, that our way is just.  
&gt;  
&gt;The anomalous Israeli support obviously stems, as the poll’s presenters suggest, from Trump’s unilateral pro-Israeli decisions to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem and to abandon the Iran nuclear deal. As an added bonus, Trump is also tormenting the Palestinians, just as most Israelis believe they deserve. And Benjamin Netanyahu is constantly harping about Trump, our one and only true friend, the likes of which Israel has never seen before.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Under such circumstances, if only in response to the cognitive dissonance, it’s reasonable that Israelis convince themselves that if Trump is good for the Jews, he must be good for the entire world. If only this was the sole explanation for Israel turning into a groupie of a president that the world detests and one that most Americans, as of today, despise.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Israelis for some reason aren’t interested the fact that Trump has ruptured traditional alliances, sown division and distrust in the West and continues to maintain his peculiar relations with Vladimir Putin as well as his truly perverse love affair with Kim Jong Un. It doesn’t seem to matter to most Israelis that Trump licenses and encourages destroyers of democracy everywhere, or that he has abandoned America’s traditional pose as preacher and paragon of human rights, a term that has in any case been turned into a code word for Hussein Obama, George Soros and the New Israel Fund.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Indeed, it is his indifference to refugees, cruelty to immigrants, war against the rule of law, hatred for foreigners, never-ending lies, abusive invective, nod to racists and disdain for women that make Israelis, for obvious reasons, feel right at home with Donald Trump.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The abrasive, impatient shoot-from-the-hip novice who speaks the favorite Israeli lingua franca called dugri - roughly translated as “in your face” - is one of us, an honorary member of the Israeli tribe, the macho man of our dreams, and whoever doesn’t like it can lump it.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;But you can rest assured that if the day comes when Israel is forced to pay a price for its unhesitating and nearly unequivocal embrace of a leader so universally abhorred, the dynamic duo of Trump and Netanyahu will be quick to agree that Fake News liberals are once again to blame.

&gt; Originating from Leeds, the Sisters of Mercy were described by critic Steve Huey as playing ""a slow, gloomy, ponderous hybrid of metal and psychedelia, often incorporating dance beats."" The one constant in the band's career has been deep-voiced singer Andrew Eldritch.  The band is named after the Leonard Cohen song ""Sisters of Mercy"" according to Eldritch. The band originally formed in 1980 with guitarist Gary Marx and drummer-turned-vocalist Eldritch.  Doktor Avalanche, the drum machine, joined them on their second single Alice. Guitarist Ben Gunn and bassist Craig Adams were added to make live gigs feasible, and the Sisters built a reputation through several singles and EPs. Gunn left the band in 1983 and was replaced by Wayne Hussey. 

&gt; They signed to WEA in 1984 and released the Body And Soul single. This featured a re-recording of Body Electric, Train, and Afterhours. This was followed by Walk Away towards the end of the year. The B-sides were Poison Door and On The Wire. Early releases of this single came with the 7"" flexi Long Train (amphetamix).

&gt; 1985 started with the release of No Time To Cry (backed with Blood Money and Bury Me Deep) and their first album First And Last And Always. In 1985 Gary Marx chose to leave the band, leaving a few days after the recording of First And Last And Always and Marian for The Old Grey Whistle Test program. The final concert of the tour at the Royal Albert Hall was recorded and subsequentally released as Wake on VHS.

&gt; During rehearsals for the next album, Craig Adams walked out and was followed by Wayne Hussey. The two of them formed a band and started gigging under the name The Sisterhood. For the full story on this go here.

&gt; Eldritch retired to Hamburg in Germany and started working on the new album. He enlisted the help of former Gun Club bassist Patricia Morrison although it is still unclear to how much she contributed musically to the project. This Corrosion (originally written to be part of The Sisterhood project), was released as a single in 1987. The single was backed with Torch (apparently the song that caused Craig Adams to walk out) and Colours (re-recorded from The Sisterhood album).
This was followed by the album Floodland. The CD version of the album contained Torch and Colours as extra tracks.
Dominion was released as a single after this and the video was filmed in the ancient Jordanian city of Petra. The B-sides were Sandstorm and Untitled. Emma, a live favourite, appeared on the 12"" release and Ozymandias, a mixup of Dominion being played backwards was released on the CD and the Limited Edition 12"" boxset.  The final single Lucretia was released in 1988 and the video recorded in India. A video for 1959 was shot at the same time. The B-side to Lucretia was Long Train which had originally been released as a limited edition flexi 7"" with the Walk Away single. All the Floodland-era videos was released on VHS in 1989 on the ""Shot"" video.

&gt; In 1989, Morrison was dropped from the band and Eldritch started working with young Hamburg musician Andreas Bruhn. Between them, they wrote Vision Thing. Recorded in Denmark, the band was expanded to include ex-Sigue Sigue Sputnik bassist Tony James and ex-All About Eve guitarist Tim Bricheno. The album was much more rock-orientated than anything The Sisters had done before.

&gt; A single, More was released in 1990 (B-Side You Could Be The One) followed by the album, Vision Thing. A tour of Europe commenced, the first Sisters tour since 1985 followed by a disastrous tour with Public Enemy in the US, which was cancelled before all the dates were completed. Doctor Jeep was released later in 1990 (B-Sides live bootleg recordings from 1985) and a German only release of When You Don't See Me followed in 1991 (with bootleg recordings from 1990 on the b-side). The Sisters toured throughout 1991. After this period, Tony James left the band.

&gt; It was decided to release all the early EPs on CD for the first time and Temple Of Love was re-recorded with Ofra Haza supplying the backing vocals. Temple Of Love (1992) was released and was the highest placed single The Sisters had had in the UK charts, peaking at no. 3. This featured an extended version of Vision Thing, the german release of When You Don't See Me and the remix of Detonation Boulevard on the b-sides. They headline major European music festivals. Tim Bricheno and Andreas Bruhn both officially leave, but Bruhn continued to play live with The Sisters in 1993 along with newcomer Adam Pearson. 

&gt; 1993 brought us a ""greatest hits' compilation. A Slight Case Of Overbombing with all the A-sides from the beginning of their major label involvement in 1984 to 1993. Notable exceptions are Vision Thing (Canadian Club Mix) which featured on the Temple Of Love 1992 single and Detonation Boulevard (remix) which appeared on a promo CD on Elektra records to promote the album in the US. The single, Under The Gun, a re-working of ""Two Worlds Apart"" by Billie Hughes and featured Berlin vocalist Terri Nunn, was released in support of the album. The B-Side was a re-recording of Alice. The video complilation, Shot Rev2.0, was released which featured the Floodland, Vision Thing promos as well as Temple Of Love (1992) and Under The Gun.

&gt; After this release, Eldritch effectively went on strike refusing to work with the East West  record label. The live incarnation of the band reappeared in 1996 playing several European concert dates with The Sex Pistols. Chris Sheenan joined as second guitar. New songs began to pepper the setlist. Chris left the band in 1997 and Mike Varjak took his place. Eldritch subsequently sent East West an album, which they accepted without listening to it, and The Sisters were finally free. The album (known as SSV) is third rate techno, with the drums removed and Eldritch talking nonsense. Although adverts appeared in the music press around that time, the album never saw an official release.

&gt; More touring commenced in 1998, but no album was released. A North American tour commenced in 1999. 2000 saw the return of Chris Sheenan and European halls and festivals were played for the next two years. Chris Sheenan started compiling video footage shot at the 2002 festivals for a future DVD release. A video of (We Are The Same) Suzanne was released on the bands' website, and swiftly removed due to heavy leeching. The audio is still available.

&gt; 2003 brought more European gigs, but 2004 was a year off. Another European tour began in 2005, which saw the departure of Chris Sheenan, to be replaced by Leeds own Robochrist, Chris Catalyst. Also, taking the place of Adam Pearson was Ben Christo who joined in 2006. Their longest tour yet started that year, beginning in Las Vegas in February and finishing in December in Moscow. 2007 brought 3 European festival gigs in June and July.

O Ciro tem boas chances de provocar aumento de impostos (menos que Haddad), mas não é que você ligue pra economia mesmo, ao menos ele promete seguir a reforma da previdência.

Sobre sua noção de ""lei dura pra vagabundo"", bom vou repetir o que vc já deve ter ouvido, o cara que assalta o seu iPhone ou pára motorista de ônibus com arma não tá roubando pra manter uma casa com pobres 5 crianças passando fome. Nunca. Ele rouba porque dá muito dinheiro, depois ostenta na vida boa. Se o crime for uma profissão sem risco, teremos assaltantes, porque compensa MUITO. Pode colocar educação TOP, não vai resolver. Até classe-média entra no crime com a lei que está. Não quer dizer implantar a ditadura, é simplesmente deixar melhor do que está, é pedir muito?

Claro que você vai ignorar o que falei, mas eu sugiro que você também veja os vídeos do ""brasileirinhos"", são bem pesados https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuxS4GwZvMs e https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbLY-o9FvCE .

False,dect60,1412306656.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_ioktg,,"RUSSELS—The United Nations atomic agency hit back Tuesday at Israeli claims it is failing to police Iran’s nuclear work, rebuffing criticisms of the agency’s credibility.

The dispute comes as European countries, China and Russia seek to uphold the 2015 deal that placed restrictions on Iran’s nuclear activities, a deal which the Trump administration quit in May. Israel has consistently opposed the agreement, arguing it wouldn’t prevent Tehran obtaining a nuclear weapon.

The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency oversees compliance with the agreement and polices Iran’s nuclear work. Tehran claims its nuclear program, which was scaled back under the 2015 deal, was for peaceful purposes.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has twice alleged over the past six months that Iran is cheating on the deal and is still harboring a nuclear-weapons program.

In April, Mr. Netanyahu said Israeli agents had extracted thousands of documents and material from what he alleged was a nuclear archive in Tehran. The information was passed to Washington and to the IAEA.

Last week he showed images of what he said was a secret atomic warehouse in Tehran that he said the Iranian government is now trying to cleanse. Iran has denied the claims.

Speaking at the U.N. last week, Mr. Netanyahu said that despite sharing the nuclear archive information with the IAEA, the agency had “still not taken any action” and that he was therefore going public in disclosing the alleged nuclear site.

“Well, Mr. Amano, do the right thing,” he said of IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano. “Go inspect this atomic warehouse. Immediately. Before the Iranians finish clearing it out…And Mr. Amano, while you’re at it, inspect the other sites we told you about. Once and for all, tell the world the truth about Iran.”

Mr. Amano Tuesday responded without referencing Mr. Netanyahu or the alleged site directly. In a statement, he said the agency uses all relevant information available “but it does not take any information at face value.”

He said that “all information obtained, including from third parties, is subject to rigorous review and assessed together with other available information to arrive at an independent assessment.” The agency has had access to “all the sites and locations in Iran which it needed to visit.”

In a statement Tuesday, Mr. Netanyahu said “The IAEA should check the site and send inspectors immediately with radiation detectors, and the prime minister’s words will be proven true.”

Under the 2015 deal, the IAEA has access to declared nuclear sites and nonnuclear locations where illicit work, including on how to weaponize nuclear material, may be taking place. But the agency must have credible reasons for concern to visit a nonnuclear site and discuss that first with Iran.

Israel’s charges put the agency on the defensive. While the claims have not been verified, Israel’s disclosures of what it says are secret nuclear sites have sparked doubts about the agency’s rigor. The IAEA has limited resources to defend itself: it is prevented for confidentiality reasons from publicly disclosing locations it visits.

Senior Western diplomats in Vienna have said the agency is still working through the nuclear archive information, which Israeli officials have said totals more than 50,000 pages and includes material on 183 computer disks. Most of that information covers Iran’s past nuclear work, which U.S. and Israeli officials say Tehran kept to reactivate a nuclear weapons program.

Critics, including some former IAEA officials, have said the agency has been insufficiently aggressive in policing the nuclear deal and that its 2015 probe into Iran’s past nuclear work failed to hold Tehran to account.

After the probe, the IAEA reported that Iran had an organized nuclear weapon program until 2003 and continued some activities until 2009.

And most people charge their phone when they sleep ... I would guess your phone was idle for at least 6 hours which would give us 24% if someone is using their phone their charge usually goes 7-11% per hour with normal browsing ... gonna go with 9% for simplicity by that logic you wouldve needed more then another 6 hours to burn throught battery ...

You have line messenger and a lot of social stuff ,but no notifications ... You really do keep up to date with them or you turned them off cause u dont care ... I think the first one ...

&gt;What we may be witnessing is not just the end of the Cold War, or the passing of a particular period of post-war history, but the end of history as such… that is, the end point of mankind’s ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government. 

Fukuyama looked ahead and saw that with the fall of the Soviets, all of the enemies of liberal democracy had been defeated. The monarchs, fascists, national socialists, and communists were all gone; what was left was the combination of democracy and civil rights.

**In order to advance the civil rights agenda, free market economic systems had merged with socialism, in part to compete with the rising force of the Left since the late 1700s. These systems generated vast wealth, taxed it heavily, and paid out social benefits to keep strong consumer economies going.**

**This has created over time a convergence on third-world style governments: democracies run by Leftists who rule with an iron hand through a corrupt press and vast gangs of true believers.** As the article points out:

&gt;Emerging economies today may be in love with Apple and McDonald’s, and are often more pro-capitalist than us, but they – or at least their ruling classes – have proved immune to our political values. In fact, we no longer believe in many of them ourselves, such has been the extent of our philosophical decay.

&gt;The shocking reality is that the great democracies, including, tragically, Britain, are becoming steadily less libertarian and less democratic; at the same time, the rising Asian powers are becoming less oppressive overall, primarily thanks to their partial embrace of economic freedoms.

&gt;The two models are meeting in the middle, and the result is terrifying. Political systems are becoming less distinct and the old ideological power blocs (such as “the West”) are blurring or even gradually merging into one uniform mush (Bruno Maçães, a former Portuguese minister, talks of the rise of a “Eurasia” dominated by the EU, China and Russia, three entities that share a distrust of liberal democracy).

&gt;In a brilliant article for Quillette, the political scientist Clay Fuller calls this new consensus “authoritarian liberalism”. 

**Leftism proved to be unstable and so the only way to make it work is for it to shift toward centralized power. This however shows us a larger event in progress: we are shifting from decentralized systems, which are too chaotic, to strong power across the board.**

**Ultimately this spells doom for democracy, and has set up a conflict where strong power Leftists increasing resemble Communists, while strong power Rightists tend toward either monarchism or 1930s hybrid systems like national socialism or fascism.**

Look how quickly Communism lite is spreading through the USA as propelled by minority votes and millennials who are fulfilling the desires of their hippie-era instructors:

&gt;There are 42 people running for offices at the federal, state and local levels this year with the formal endorsement of the Democratic Socialists of America, the organization says. They span 20 states, including Florida, Hawaii, Kansas and Michigan.

&gt;The most ambitious Democrats in Washington have been reluctant to embrace the label, even as they embrace the policies defining modern-day democratic socialism: Medicare for all, a $15 minimum wage, free college tuition and the abolition of the federal department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, also known as ICE.

These people support the idea of taking from the successful to give to the unsuccessful. They have dedicated millions of man-hours to hiding this simple fact because it sounds bad, but the reality is that as in nature, some organisms thrive while some are barely making it by.

We all benefit when we follow the behavior model of those that thrive. When we imitate those who are not thriving, suddenly no one is thriving. This is the lesson of Darwin, and also what we have learned from Communism and the French Revolution, watching egalitarian societies collapse.

Egalitarianism is a third-world model. When no one is thriving, having more people means a greater likelihood that one will survive, so giving everyone a small amount of food makes sense. However, you never get high-performers this way, only subsistence living; every society which has become great has done so by giving more to those who do more, so that more of those are produced. That, too, is Darwinism. For egalitarians, then, advancing their ideas requires having others who are also in denial of this reality. They like “consensus” because it enables them to obscure knowledge that reality is contrary to the theory of egalitarianism; they want compliance precisely because their ideology denies reality.

This arises from their fundamental individualism. They want to be able to throw mud in a tin pot and call it art, instead of having someone impose a standard higher than the individual as to what “art” is. They want also to be able to do what they want and call it “good” and “right” instead of looking to the obvious, larger meaning of those terms.

Naturally, this causes a problem for the egalitarians. How much consensus do they need? When news travels slowly and societies are localized, they need a local consensus; in the age of radio, television, and internet, they need to conquer the whole world in order to suppress knowledge of how unrealistic their ideas are.

**Ironically, they conquered the world using an economic system. They did this by creating a cycle where capitalism produces income, government taxes it, money gets redistributed, and then the lowest echelons of society have buying power, which enables the creation of consumerism and thus a vapid, disposable society.**

**In order to make their ideology a cornerstone of this, they have made capitalism addicted to consumerism since it keeps the flow of money going. Consumers “work hard” at cubicle jobs, spend money, and receive money if they are not successful; the unsuccessful horde then spends its money, allowing an economy to be built on nonsense like entertainment and other “service industry” notions: luxuries, fads, trends, irrelevancies.**

Even better, the egalitarians keep the system going through resentment and scapegoating. Witness this first-class propaganda from The New York Times in which they both status signal, demand compliance, and gaslight the average citizen in order to force them into the victimhood-scapegoat cycle:

&gt;Yes, my father is angry at someone. But it is not his co-worker Gem, a Filipino immigrant with whom he has split a room to pocket some of the per diem from their employer, or Francisco, a Hispanic crew member with whom he recently built a Wendy’s north of Memphis. His anger, rather, is directed at bosses who exploit labor and governments that punish the working poor — two sides of a capitalist democracy that bleeds people like him dry.

&gt;“Corporations,” Dad said. “That’s it. That’s the point of the sword that’s killing us.”

&gt;Among white workers, this negative energy has been manipulated to great political effect by a conservative trifecta in media, private interest and celebrity that we might call Fox, Koch and Trump. 

Scapegoating consists of blaming others for the lack of success an individual experiences; if someone else is doing better, and is wealthier, he can blame them for his own lack of productivity. This is similar to the corollary to affirmative action known as “disparate impact,” which says that if one group succeeds more than another, the first group is to blame and must subsidize the other group.

Victimhood comprises the mental state required to blame others and the condition of thus failing in life by perpetually seeking reasons why the individual should not change his own behavior, instead of changing behavior to be more like the successes.

The Left operates exclusively through victimhood because the only people who want equality are those who feel unequal, or that success (social, financial, political, intellectual) has left them behind. Victimhood creates a market for information and entertainment that reinforces that view of the individual as victim.

This defers authority from society to a condition where an external notion, like an ideology or a profitable idea, drives the decisions made by that society. Instead of society using ideas to advance itself, it becomes enslaved to them, and merely acts out those ideologies as a means of maintaining internal stability.

That externalization exists as part of the herd behavior of humankind, and manifests in politics, the economy, and social pressures alike. Those three areas — political, economic, and social — in egalitarian societies become dedicated to making choices by number of supporters, or quantity over quality.

In Europe, the EU trod all over Greece's rights in order to save German, French, and British banks from their own greed.  Moreover, the EU is a fundamentally undemocratic institution.  The Parliament is a joke and it's too big to ever be anything but an ungainly mess.  Internal EU migration is convenient, but it's socially disruptive for countries on the receiving end, and it's economically harmful for countries losing population.  The lack of external border controls is infuriating.  The inability of governments to adjust interest rates or currency values to suit their local conditions is crippling - and Germany, thanks to its central location, large population, and long tradition of industry and infrastructure, is by far the largest beneficiary.  It's no wonder that regions at the periphery of the EU suffer - Greece, Portugal, Spain, southern Italy.  And those that don't, like Ireland, act like giant money laundering and tax evasion joints.

The EU is now facing a crisis of where the balance of power in national sovereignty vs EU centralization lies, and weirdly enough it's not even a consistent battle.  Poland wants immigration control, but also wants a more federal EU defence force, for example.

The EU is also unable to react to rogue members who harm democracy.

False,valegrete,1440957445.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_pzaz7,False,"The schism happened in stages, precipitated by different events over a period of 400 years, and didn’t become a concrete reality for the Christian populace until after the 4th Crusade. Both sides did things that contributed to the breach, but a general outline of the stages would look something like this:

1. Historical Precursors: By the fourth century, the previously fully united Roman Empire came to be ruled by a western Emperor in Rome and an eastern Emperor in Constantinople, each with relatively autonomous control over his part of the Empire. By the fifth-sixth centuries, it became impossible for East and West to directly communicate since the Greeks no longer spoke Latin, or vice versa. To read each other’s thought, scholars had to rely on translations of typically poor (sometimes maliciously) quality. In the seventh century, Muslims captured the Mediterranean and most of Western Europe save Italy came under the rule of a constantly revolving door of barbarian warlords, resulting in a geographical isolation between east and west. Theologians in the East came to start looking down on the West as a bunch of uncivilized simpletons, and refused to engage with its ideas. 

2. 800 AD: The Pope installs Charlemagne as the first Emperor of a new Holy Roman Empire, an action that triggers widespread disapproval in the East because (1) it appeared to amount to political schism and (2) blurred the line between religious and secular rule in a way that violated the longstanding balance between the sacerdotium and the imperium. Charlemagne accuses the East of heresy in response, becoming the first person to raise the Filioque issue into general Christian consciousness. 

3. 860s AD: The Photian Schism. The Byzantine Emperor exiles Patriarch Ignatius of Constantinople and appoints Photius in his place. Ignatius appeals to Rome and the Pope sends his legates to investigate the situation, all of which is actually accepted as valid by the Orthodox in light of Canon III of the Council of Sardica. Photius voluntarily complies with the inquiry and the legates report back to the Pope favorably. This is where the controversy starts: Pope Nicholas I rejects the findings of his legates and orders a retrial to be convened in Rome. The East sees this as an uncanonical abuse of power and ignores the council’s resolutions, and Photius himself convenes his own council to accuse Nicholas of heresy (regarding the Filioque and abuse of Papal power) and anathematize him. Eventually Ignatius regains power and a second Constantinopolitan  council is held to restore communion with Rome and excommunicate Photius. After Ignatius dies, Photius reassumes the Patriarchate and holds a *third* council which only rescinds his excommunication, leaving Rome’s rehabilitation in tact. The East remembers Nicholas I as a power-hungry tyrant who only rejected his legates’ decision because there was no way to construe Photius’ actions as acquiescence to papal supremacy. The West considers Photius, at least during his first reign, to be a scheming politician who duped the legates and whipped up anti-Papal sentiment in the East to cement his position. In any case, at the end of the process, outward unity was maintained between East and West though the major dividing lines had been drawn. 

4. Early 900s: Patriarch Sergius I of Constantinople removes Pope Sergius IV from the diptychs (lists of all the patriarchs, past and present, who he considers orthodox), possibly due to a letter received from the Pope which endorsed the Filioque. From this point forward, the two sees were effectively out of communion with each other at a clerical level, but the wider churches remained unaware of the separation and over time it was forgotten since the diptychs were often incomplete. 

5. 1054: Patriarch Cerularius of Constantinople makes an overture of goodwill to the Pope and offers to restore him to the diptychs, so the Pope sends Humbert and a few other legates to Constantinople. Cerularius and Humbert were extremely stubborn, ill-tempered men and eventually each excommunicated the other, but not their wider churches. Again, at this point, the breach hasn’t yet reached popular consciousness. 

6. Late 11th Century - The First Crusade. After recapturing the Holy Land, the Latin Crusaders install Latin Patriarchs in Jerusalem and Antioch instead of returning the territories to the Eastern Churches. In vacant Jerusalem this doesn’t cause an issue, but the Eastern Patriarch of Antioch had never left the city. For the first time the schism rears its head among the populace as the city’s churches and Christians are split between two bishops. 

7. 13th Century - Fourth Crusade. The deposed former Byzantine Emperor convinces the crusaders to change course and help him regain the throne. Disgusted by the political machinations of Constantinople, the Crusaders instead lay waste to the city and install a Latin Patriarch. This cements the schism in the popular imagination of Eastern Christendom: the clergy and the people refuse obedience to this Patriarch, renounce the West, and eventually regain the Cathedral a few decades later. 

8. After this event, multiple attempts at reconciliation fail, most notably after the Council of Florence in 1431. As in the past, the majority of the Orthodox delegates, pressured by political considerations, agree to Roman terms in exchange for military support in their struggle against invaders. However, the Union is never accepted in the Byzantine world, mostly due to the influence of Mark of Ephesus, and eventually Constantinople falls to the Ottomans without Latin support.

&gt; The threat from a senior US diplomat to &amp;quot;Take out&amp;quot; Russian missiles that Washington believes are in breach of an important Cold War arms control treaty looks set to cause additional tensions with Moscow, just ahead of a meeting of Nato defence ministers that opens in Brussels on Wednesday.

&gt; &amp;quot;At that point we would be looking at the capability to take out a missile that could hit any of our countries,&amp;quot; she said, adding counter-measures would be to take out the missiles that are in development by Russia in violation of the treaty.

&gt; Some of Washington&amp;#039;s allies agreed to receive US Pershing and Cruise missiles in response.

What I like about European food is that everything is so various depending on the region you visit even if it's geographically close.

Even in France you won't find the same kind of food from West to East or North to South. I'm from the south east so grew up with ""Savoyard"" food which is close to Swiss gastronomy (lots of cheese and meat) but moved to the south west where everything is more... *Spanish* in a way, with all the seafood, paellas, spices, etc.

Additionally this is the US not Europe so that employee doesn’t get any health care, education, social services ect from their taxes (at least not in the way Europe does) so they now have to pay for that still out of their now reduced pay. So I pay an employee $8/hr plus tips costs me about $15/hr and the employee actually only sees $4-5/hr after taxes. Everybody gets their cut along the way. Also do you think bartenders and servers are going to be making $25+ an hour? The current livable wages they currently make? No they’re going to be raised up to whatever the minimum in their state is which is far lower than than what they took home before. Do you think waiters and bartenders will still make $30 when the new standard is minimum the same it is in the rest of the country? No they won’t. Do you think managers and owners are going to love watching 30-40% of their cost go to employees when it used to be 20%. People bitch about a $3 beer and go across the street for the $2.75 beers. You would need a nationwide movement to a LIVING wage and a government that provides services for our tax dollars not just a military.  So yes the customers pay it but currently the majority goes directly to the server instead of having to go through all these other mechanisms that suck any benefit to the server or business. I can’t rack on 20% because I’ll go out of business and my staff will leave to get jobs where they can afford to live. There is no business model where I can pay my bartenders $200-$400 a night when it’s busy or the $100 they get on a slow night where the business doesn’t make a cent. The only people who always make money and make the best money on average are the servers and bartenders.  They’re some of the few service workers who can have a career working decent hours with a decent work/life balance. My bartenders make as much as teachers working 30 hours a week how does anyone in their right mind see a switch resulting in the staff (the people these anti tippers claim to support) continue to have a good gig after you rout their tip through everything. It’s a way to get around how shitty things are for the working man here not keep him/her down. 

You NEVER see the people anti tippers claim to want to help advocating this. Unless they are from Europe in which case they have a whole different system that works and makes sense for them.

And by that I mean he was definitely talking with this ex during your whole relationship and just dragging you along for the ride. I dated a guy just like this - charmed the pants right off me, pursued me, and then it was on and off for months. Hot and cold. Turns out it’s hard to commit to me (attractive, kind, normal) when he’s hung up on not just one, but about six ex-girlfriends. He even went so far as to start sleeping with one who I worked with... so embarrassing. Just so awful. Then when he was STILL trying to win me back after I’d found out all of his horrible deeds, I come to learn he was sleeping with an on and off ex of about 8 years. How’d I learn that? He knocked her up by accident. Whoops! 

Enough about that jerk. He was a high-level cheating fake-nice-guy schmuck. Your ex may not have reached CEO status of the asshole corporate structure like the guy I dated, but let’s be clear... he’s shown you who he is. And as Maya Angelou said and as I repeat constantly - when someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time. 

I know it’s very tempting to go down the path where you justify his behavior and look at your relationship with rose-colored glasses. You’re probably still grasping onto some hope that he’ll cancel that Europe trip, remember how amazing you are, and come back. He won’t. And if he did, you’d be making the worst mistake of your life to take him back. 

Some things - it doesn’t matter how perfect you are, you can’t control someone else’s behavior. You could be an absolute unsavory monster and be with a man who adores you and would never leave you. You could be Beyoncé and have your man cheat on you. You can be perfection and if you’re with someone who isn’t ready or healthy enough or whatever enough to love you as you deserve, you will not get what you need. When you settle, you get even less than what you settled for. Read that sentence again. “But I don’t think he cheated. But I didn’t settle.” Even if he didn’t cheat, that relationship you describe sounds like a shit show. Fighting all the time isn’t good. Having this enormous presence of an ex isn’t good. With all the drama and obvious desire of this ex to get him back, you shouldn’t have had to ask to have him block her. You shouldn’t have even known what was on her Facebook. He never would’ve considered or brought up meeting with her where you have to ask him not to. Ugh. What a dick. I just can’t even. 

How do I know you settled? Because that’s not love. That’s not fun. That’s not what healthy relationships look like. 

You dodged a major bullet. You need to drop down some hardcore boundaries between you and this guy. Build the wall of China between you. Never, ever let him back. Ever. And don’t for a second let this ruin you for the amazing, good, lovable guys out there. 

After I got away from the guy I described above, I was so shaken from it that I saw a counselor. Best decision ever. I’d recommend it. I asked her to help me learn how to date. Less than a year later, I accepted a date from the man I later married. Love of my life. Kindest guy on the planet. Most fun ever. We’ve never been on and off. I’ve never doubted the way he feels about me.  I’ve never had to question if I can trust him.

Research shows that keeping baby from overheating is what leads to decreased incidence of SIDs, so your goal is to keep your baby at a comfortable temperature at night.

Honestly, this ""comfortable temperature"" is cultural. I also live in a sub-tropical climate and the general population either doesn't have/use AC or if they do they keep it at 27 or 28 Celsius. They cannot believe that westerners keep their homes as cold as 22-23C and live comfortably, and if you told them you had an infant they would shame you for keeping the house too cold and the baby too cold. They also don't keep their infants in heavy sleeping materials, which helps with decreasing risk of overheating. Do your checks (feel their neck to check for excessive heat or cold), and the baby should be fine.

So... take what you read on the internet with a grain of salt. A lot of that information is targeted at people who live in the US/Europe and are used to keeping their houses cooler anyway.

As for the pick, Klopp’s teams try to play the same way every match, it’s the opponents setup that dictates whether it’s a defensive battle or a high flying attacking match (Chelsea at the weekend). Taking that into account, Ancelotti knows that Klopp’s sides struggle against a tight and compact defense. However, as you mentioned, Napoli plays attacking football. Playing an open match against Liverpool is suicide unless you have the players to keep pace, which imo Napoli do not. To that end, Liverpool look a different animal this season, and they could put away 3 or 4 against a side that parks the bus if they can figure out how to finish.

I finish, wipe the sweat from my brow and now there was just a liquid shit right in the middle of this bathroom. So i shimmy the trash can and place it on top of it also in the middle.

* Assuming Abe is around 55 years of age now, he must've been in his early thirties when he came to America.

* Abe is highly educated, and a brilliant mathematician.  

*  Abe was was able to get such an education while being a Jew in Europe and was able to emigrate/flee to America with his wife when things got bad for them there. 

* The show never implies or indicates that Midge had a rough childhood. OR that they had any financial problems during their initial time in America.

*  Weissman family's lifestyle,behaviour &amp; views clearly reflects of people who grew up in money. Maid (Zelda) who is an employee and gets  benefits like days off and paid vacation (she went to Iceland), Rose wastes money on an astrologer/mystic, Abe plays piano, Rose &amp; Midge's designer clothes, etc.

* I don't think professors are paid enough to affords a Upper East Side lifestyle on their salary.

We stand today at a unique and extraordinary moment. The crisis in the Persian Gulf, as grave as it is, also offers a rare opportunity to move toward an historic period of cooperation. Out of these troubled times, our fifth objective -- a new world order -- can emerge: a new era -- freer from the threat of terror, stronger in the pursuit of justice, and more secure in the quest for peace. An era in which the nations of the world, East and West, North and South, can prosper and live in harmony. A hundred generations have searched for this elusive path to peace, while a thousand wars raged across the span of human endeavor. Today that new world is struggling to be born, a world quite different from the one we've known. A world where the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle. A world in which nations recognize the shared responsibility for freedom and justice. A world where the strong respect the rights of the weak. This is the vision that I shared with President Gorbachev in Helsinki.

The basic thesis of the article is self-refuting. He starts off in his abstract by saying:

&gt;Secular linguists are puzzled by the existence of twenty or so language families in the world today. ... if speech did evolve somewhere, somehow, we would expect to find that all languages are genetically related. They clearly are not.

And proceeds later to answer his own objection when he says

&gt;statistically all words in a language should be replaced within a period of about 10,000 years. That would make any research beyond that period of time impossible. This, in turn, makes it impossible to prove that all language families are ultimately related.

The fact that he knew that to begin with changes his abstract from ill-informed to blatantly dishonest. I’ll be happy to retract this statement if you can show me a more charitable interpretation.

Considering this, it’s actively hilarious that he goes on to argue that

&gt;Moreover, recent findings, as we have seen, suggest that Ket is related to the Na-Dene languages. ... Wieland points out that ‘to have such close correlation’s still existing makes little sense if the migrations were as much as 11,000 years ago, as is commonly believed. From the biblical record, they would have been less than some 4,000 years ago’

So when languages aren’t related, that proves YEC because we’d expect them to be related. And when languages are related, that proves YEC because we’d expect them to not be related. This is about as disingenuous as it gets.

The section entitled “language change and design” is perhaps the worst part of the article. Aside from the customary misunderstanding of basic facts and concepts, there are, like, multiple fields of active linguistic research addressing the questions he raises, on both the specific and the general theoretic level, and he ignores *all of this*, without so much as a reference.

I can’t do justice to it here, but just a few nuggets:

&gt;History shows that when a language changes, it tends to become more user-friendly.

No. It is universally recognised that this is *not* what happens during language evolution (who defines “user-friendly” anyway?) and any intro to historical linguistics should have told him that.

&gt;The fact remains that the Greek/Sanskrit parent was utterly consistent, and highly sophisticated.

Firstly, late PIE it wasn’t “utterly consistent” (I can give you quite a few examples of paradigmatic irregularity) and insofar as it is consistent that is clearly an artefact of reconstruction.

Doubly hilarious is the fact that this guy doesn’t seem to know the Greek/Sanskrit parent was *late* PIE. A “less sophisticated” early stage of the language is comparatively attested (in Hittite and its cousins) so we can effectively observe this language he says can’t have evolved evolving. And even if you go with the minority of Indo-Europeanists who think the Anatolian reductions are innovations, internal reconstruction does the job just as well.

I mean, when your sample size is one, and what you say about that one family is *empirically wrong*, that kind of undermines your argument.

&gt;others have made up entirely new case systems, but less consistent and less sophisticated than the original.

Newly evolved case systems do have different properties to old case systems, so as long as we are ignoring everything we know about case grammaticalisation that might have been a good route to go down. As it is, new case systems tend to be *more* consistent, both phonologically and semantically, than older systems. Not only is this guy trying to turn expected and understood directionality into a problem for the model, he gets the direction of the directionality wrong.

&gt;Language change, as Crowley’s model shows, would be unlikely to produce consistent endings for the whole of the Inflecting Language. [Clarified in footnote: It could possibly make such patterns for an agglutinating language, but not for an inflecting language, as the phonological reduction would not be consistent.]

I’ve no idea 1) why he thinks this in the first place and 2) why he thinks PIE violates the rule he incorrectly thinks inflected languages need to follow...? Again, open any intro PIE textbook. Phonological reductions do vary with stem ending. They probably varied more than we can reconstruct.

&gt; most of the changes were not random, but the result of intelligence

That depends on the level on which you observe the change. Where the language system is concerned this is false. See my conversation with u/Muskwatch.

False,CaPeBaLo,1478812337.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_12q9c5,False,"Já estive numa situação muito parecida, na faculdade. O que ajudou foi que fizemos algum trabalho (num grupo de umas 7 pessoas) juntos, então já serviu pra dar uma primeira aproximada, daí em diante foi mais tranquilo, a gente já se cumprimentava e trocava uns olhares. Provavelmente os assuntos iniciais foram coisas relacionadas ao curso, às aulas, às provas, aos estudos, à carreira, à faculdade, aos professores, etc.

Imagino que, assim como eu, você tenha problemas com a aproximação inicial, principalmente se ela estiver num grupo. Nesse caso é esperar ela ficar sozinha e arranjar uma desculpa pra aproximação. Como você disse que já trocam uns olhares, acho que fica até mais tranquilo (que foi o que aconteceu comigo naquele caso da faculdade). Se vocês pegam ônibus juntos pode ajudar bastante, aproveita no ônibus e ""percebe"" que você a conhece e puxar um papo é até mais tranquilo - ""oi, você é da minha sala no cursinho, né?"". Ainda, talvez na hora da saída, quando ela estiver saindo da sala, você calcula pra sair junto ""acidentalmente"", tipo pra vocês acabarem passando pela porta ao mesmo tempo; é claro que você não vai se espremer pra passar junto, então você dá a passagem pra ela. Mesmo que nesse dia você não fale com ela, já tem uma desculpa pra cumprimentar ela no dia seguinte, mesmo que seja só um aceno de longe com a mão, um sorriso e um ""oi"" quando entrar na sala. Depois de um tempo você pode ""se programar"" pra sair junto de novo ""sem querer"" e aproveitar pra puxar algum assunto tipo ""a aula de hoje foi difícil/boa/chata/interessante/qualquercoisa, né?"", e daí pra frente ir mantendo a conversa. Tente deixar a conversa fluir, aproveite um assunto pra puxar o outro, mas sem parecer que está interrogando ela ou seguindo um cronograma. Por exemplo, se começar com o assunto da aula fácil/difícil, isso já dá pra engatar um ""de que aulas você mais gosta"", ""com que matérias tem mais facilidade"", ""vai prestar vestibular pra que?"", ""que área pretende seguir?"", etc. Eu não recomendaria coisas como ""as aulas da professora Beltrana são ruins"" ou ""já percebeu que o professor Fulano fede?"", já que esse pode ser um assunto chato, passar uma impressão de fofoqueiro, de superficial. Lembrando que não é legal fazer um interrogatório, então depois que ela responder, se ela não perguntar de volta o que você pretende fazer, vale a pena aprofundar um pouco mais a questão ou simplesmente dizer ""bacana. Eu pretendo prestar pra [insira aqui seu curso desejado]"". E claro, tenha bom senso e tente identificar se o assunto a está agradando, se vale a pena tentar se aprofundar naquele assunto, se vale a pena mudar...

Com relação ao WhatsApp, se vocês forem tímidos acho que pode sim ser uma opção. Aqui vale a mesma coisa do parágrafo anterior - arrume uma desculpa, e de resto deixa rolar.

Sobre convidar pra comer/beber alguma coisa acho que o ideal é fazer não parecer um encontro, pelo menos sendo tímido e querendo uma aproximação mais tranquila, tipo ""tá afim de ir em tal lugar amanhã?"", nada muito combinado. Acho mais válido um ""tá afim de dar uma passada no [insira aqui qualquer restaurante ou barzinho bacana aí perto]?"", algo mais casual e de momento, entende? Ainda, eu não usaria isso como abordagem - o convite pode até ser no dia que vocês estabeleceram o primeiro contato, mas depois de conversar um pouco, quando sentir que ambos estão confortáveis e num momento onde pareça que você está aproveitando que vocês já vão ter que sair (ou que já estão saindo, caminhando e ~~cantando~~ conversando ~~e seguindo a canção~~), tipo no intervalo ou na saída, fica uma coisa mais natural.

O pior, sem dúvidas, é a aproximação. De resto acaba rolando mais ou menos naturalmente. O mais difícil é arrumar aquela coragem inicial, aqueles segundos de coragem, depois disso não tem mais o que fazer (não acho que você vai virar no meio do ""oi"" e ir embora) e fica mais tranquilo.

Boa sorte aí, e depois dá uma atualizada se deu certo. ;)

It is well known that communists raped many girls from 1917 in Soviet and then in Germany and then in Europe, but no one punished. Many communists rapist in Soviet. USA let them free.

Now Chinese billionaire Liu, a good dog of China communists, who claims to support communists for many many times, got arrested in Minneapolis. But USA let China communists get Chinese billionaire Liu and the girl all back to China. So USA is a coward again?

Rape is nothing and coward USA would let communist rapist free?

It is well known that communists raped many girls from 1917 in Soviet and then in Germany and then in Europe, but no one punished. Many communists rapist in Soviet. USA let them free.

Now Chinese billionaire Liu, a good dog of China communists, who claims to support communists for many many times, got arrested in Minneapolis. But USA let China communists get Chinese billionaire Liu and the girl all back to China. So USA is a coward again?

In order to pay the pensions of old people we need more in the work force.  Since people in Europe are not having many kids these days the population is decreasing, so one day the government wont be able to afford the pensions and lots of old people will starve to death or some other horrendous shit will happen.

Rather than do something about it, why not import lots of migrants?

- you don't have to educate them or provide healthcare for 18 years

- they will do undesirable jobs

- they'll fluff up the gdp making your political party look good

- they'll vote for you because you give them things

- so what if a few thousand little girls get raped?

- you can claim you're being humanitarian

I'm very cynical about the whole thing and i think its damaging for both the migrants and the natives.  What happens to their home countries?? It is the young and fit, and the wealthy that can migrate.  Mostly males.  So the home is left with infirm and less competent people in it... How do they build up from there?

Meanwhile in Europe we see cultural clashes and civil unrest.

&gt; WASHINGTON - The U.S. Treasury Department took aim Tuesday at Japan&amp;#039;s largest yakuza syndicate, placing four senior officials of the Yamaguchi-gumi on its sanctions blacklist as well as two companies tied to the gang.

&gt; Yakuza groups have ties with criminal affiliates in Asia, Europe and the Americas, where they use front companies in legitimate industries including construction, real estate and finance to launder money and hide illicit proceeds, according to the Treasury Department.

&gt; The sanctions now target 21 individuals, five criminal syndicates, two subsidiary gangs and two companies associated with yakuza groups.

Srpska never joins. People don't realise all he cared about was votes, hell he even gave passports to Chinese in exchange for them.

&gt;I was not talking about Bosnia alone but about the war in Croatia and Bosnia. 

The war was starting in locations where majority of population was Serb and Croatian, mostly as the whole campaign in republics before referendums took place were aimed at the central Belgrade government. Before the breakup everyone blamed Belgrade for everything, even if it has been proven it was all a massive scan and propaganda organised and led by US and IMF.
 
So when the referendums happened, all republics were very anti-serb, and not really anti Yugoslav. The propaganda machine successfully made Yugoslavia=Serbia. People on the ground were hostile Vs eachother before the first weapon was used due to more than a decade of bullshit. So Serbs in Croatia (knin especially) and rep. Srbska freaked out as they got stuck in countries where the rethoric on the streets was dangerous. Coming from a mixed marriage, and having relatives from Bosnia and Serbia I had the unfortunate luck to see both sides. And I understand where the fear for the safety of Serb and Croat population in Bosnia came from and Serb population in Croatia came from. 
 
The problem was that that fear was used for cleansing, murder and political gain. 
 
But let's not forget that IMF cut all funding of Yugoslavia, artificially created the highest inflation in modern Europe, impoverished the whole Balkan peninsula, and conditioned future loans go only to individual republics after they hold a independence referendum which HAS to be a local republic referendum. Financed nationalists, and forced republics into a situation where the constitution was ignored, where all it was important was to get out, even by force, and the people suffered for it, and still do, my family included.

* Don't buy more ""house"" than you need. You probably don't need a 4 bedroom house on a quarter acre when you're 25. Even though you're getting on the property market, bigger houses mean more rates, more insurance, more heating, more maintenance, and more interest paid to the bank. You first home doesn't need to be your forever home!
* In your 20s get flatmates particularly if you're single. It effectively halves your housing costs.
* If you can manage to put away 10% of your income then you will will have a comfortable retirement and won't be dependent on the government for handouts!
* Don't compare yourself to others. Don't beat yourself up for not having a 70% savings rate and $1m in the bank at 25 like some people on the internet claim.
* Likewise don't feel like you have to keep up with the Joneses and buy shit and do stuff just for the sake of it.
* I'd also highly recommend travelling both to poorer countries like poorer countries like India and African countries, but also richer countries like Japan, the US, and Europe. It gives you much more perspective on what really matters, and shows you your blind spots from growing up in NZ.

It was my first business trip to Chengdu. To the uninitiated this is the capitol of the Sichuan province, China, where they grow that lovely Sichuan pepper that makes your tongue go numb and where they love spicy food in general.

Before the meeting we had a free evening which we spent on getting to know the Sichuan-style hot pot, which is the same as a normal one, but with a finger-thick layer of chili oil on top of the broth. The broth was used to boil the various cold meat cuts, brought along with the broth, of which only meatballs looked edible for a palate of a European.

Each of us also had a can of cold-pressed sesame oil, a spoonful of garlic and parsley all mixed in a small bowl for dipping the boiled cuts.

We really tried enjoying the food, but after the meatballs were finished we had to wash the taste of the boiled meat with a local vodka. I know, “bad idea”, right?

So anyways, fast forward to morning I’ve had the stinkiest and the most painful dump in my life, took a shower, suited up and left to the lobby.

The declared half-hour drive to the meeting venue had turned into an hour long and about midway i started sweating and doing Kegels not to spring a leak of red Sichuan shit right in the middle of the bus.

When we finally arrived we appeared at a large building with glass walls, i’ve tiptoed across the entry security check, practically crabbed my way through endless high-ceilinged corridors with nuclear submarine related art and finally reached the point of my interest, the WC.

I was almost crying tears of joy when i realized that instead of a normal white ceramic toilet there was a hole in the floor with a very witty-designed foot button to flush the water through the hole.

Before this one instance i’ve considered that being able to shit literally anywhere was my superpower. But this once was the worst. Superman finally found his kryptonite.

After spending the worst 10 minutes of my life with my suit and tie, my guest badge squattingg over a hole in a fancy institute, i’ve finally made it to the room where the meeting was already going on.

Needless to say i didnt touch any food during the nice lunch our hosts had organized for us. I didnt mean to be rude, but hey - my ass means more to me than any customer in the world.

Sorry for bad English, its not my first language.

German tanks later on in the war like the Tiger and King Tiger II were intended to go toe-to-toe with other tanks. They had a powerful 88mm cannon and were heavily armored. 

For the US, however, the commander of Army ground forces felt that tanks were best suited to exploiting breakthroughs in the lines, as well as supporting infantry. Enemy armored vehicles were supposed to be engaged by Tank Destroyers - vehicles that were specifically designed to fight enemy armor.

Though by late in 1944, those on the ground in Europe were advocating for stronger tanks to combat the Nazis. This led to Shermans with stronger cannons (as we see in the game), and stronger tanks like the M26 Pershing. 

But in the meantime, the best way for a Sherman to knock out an enemy tank was to hit it from the sides or the rear. Often against the heavy German tanks, their shots would simply bounce off. As someone else said here, Allied tank commanders would use swarm tactics - having multiple Shermans attack a German tank. On average it took four tanks to kill one German tank, but this was with 75% losses.

No, not only career politicians can have public political stances. I never said it was that simplistic. But I do think footballers fall into the scope where almost every single one of them is not versed enough in political matters to talk about them. And they're in ""fanbase"" that is also not not versed enough, at times too infantile, too emotional and too tribalistic to introduce politics into yet another aspect of their lives. Just as an example, video games are heavily politicised and it's made the discourse surrounding them unbearable. Whereas 10-15+ years ago we'd discuss whether a game was subjectively fun or not, now discussion have descended into games being shit if they have black women in them or the other side saying they're shit if they don't have enough black women in them. I don't want that political discourse in football, and that's where we are heading when you look the current political landscape. I can turn on BBC news or SKY news if I want literally every angel of Bexit and the various ramifications and opinions about it discussed to death 24/7. I enjoy football to escape from that.    

&gt;I don't care what Lucas, Sol, or Di Canio say, but I will absolutely defend their right to say it.

Well then it's not you I'm talking about. I never said outright everyone, I did include that caveat that a small minority are rational enough to deal with these issues in non-disruptive manner. But as I stated with the examples I used, that's certainly not the case for the majority of users on here and by extension the wider football world.

&gt;Because the alternative is people like you deciding who should or who shouldn't be allowed public political views.

No, the alternative is everyone thinking they're an expert on everything and thinking they have a right to have an opinion on everything that needs to be given a platform. 


&gt;I'd they want to espouse idiotic views, then they will get shot down,

They don't get shot down. If they did get ""shot down"" then Bolsonaro wouldn't be the leading candidate in Brazil, the Tories wouldn't be leading the country,  fascism wouldn't be on the rise in Europe and Erdoğan wouldn't be president of Turkey. These are mainstream widely held political views, calling them idiotic and thinking they're fringe and easily shot down is exactly part of the issue I don't want. We're in a thread about Lucas Moura supporting Bolsonaro, someone says he's a moron for supporting him, someone else takes offence and says they support Bolsonaro, we get into the usual long winded, insult riddled political argument that further amplified but club rivalries and suddenly Arsenal fans are associated with being ""cucks"" and Juventus fans are ""racists"" and it's just a totally toxic environment.

&gt; http://www.flatfoot56.com/

&gt; Since the year 2000, FLATFOOT 56 have steadily unleashed a rollicking barrage of Celtic punk and folk-tinged hardcore from the South Side of Chicago to an international audience with intense and positive party-like energy. Coinciding with their 10-year anniversary, Flatfoot launched the release of their 3rd label-backed studio effort, Black Thorn, on March 30, 2010.

&gt; Led by spirited front man Tobin Bawinkel (Vocals/Guitar), along with brothers Justin (Drums), and Kyle (Bass), and multi-instrumentalists Eric McMahon (Bagpipes/Guitar) and Brandon Good (Mandolin/Guitar), the band is fueled by a sense of camaraderie that directly translates to their die-hard fans and highly energetic live shows. “We really try to create a positive environment every time we play so people feel comfortable and can let loose. It’s an experience that everyone is a part of,” explains Tobin.

&gt; Produced by the Street Dogs’ Johnny Rioux, Black Thorn tightly packs the quartet’s eclectic and driving musical charge into thirteen tracks that celebrate the pride of the working class and their Chicago roots. A collection of songs that delves into weighty thematic content, Tobin explains that the cohesive theme of Black Thorn is a fundamentally universal one. “Everyone goes through hardships, but you aren’t alone. Punk rock is about community and brotherhood. This record is our contribution to that.” As cathartic as it is ambitious, Black Thorn is an emphatic assault that remains vintage Flatfoot in its effortless combination of Celtic instrumentation and street corner punk rock. Bagpipes and mandolins remain just as vital as drums and guitars in defining Flatfoot’s sound.

&gt; While other bands run the risk of turning their message into overbearing banter from high on the soapbox, FLATFOOT 56 remain true to their ability to convey the profound all while allowing fans to get lost in the sheer energy of the music. The band’s multi-faceted approach to their craft, both in substance and in presentation, ensures that from the novice to the die-hard fan, everyone walks away with a reason to come back. After ten years of tour vans, dive bars, late nights, diverse crowds, broken bones, blood, sweat, and tears, FLATFOOT 56 offers sincere semblance of the tradition behind the music. When you have a reason to sing, you will sing louder. And when you have a reason to dance, you will bring the house down brick by brick.

&gt; The band’s sonic arsenal, which includes classic rough-and-tumble albums Knuckles Up and Jungle Of The Midwest Sea, captures both the nostalgia of brass tacks street punk and hardcore as well as inspiration taken from traditional Celtic folk. Within this musical fury, FLATFOOT 56 attacks dark and pressing subject matter—avarice, strength, faithlessness, courage, and cowardice—that speaks volumes of the values and principles on which the band was founded.

&gt; The band’s new album, Black Thorn, was released on Old Shoe Records in the United States, Stomp Records in Canada, People Like You Records in Europe, and Big Mouth Japan in Japan. Read more on Last.fm.

Cruz certainly self identifies as Jewish, and that combined with his anti-Semitic views was unfortunately probably relevant to the shooting.

My only ""concern"" about your link is that  it lists so few mass shootings in such a long time span. It must be excluding gang related shootings, bank robberies, home invasions with multiple victims, etc. How then do they define ""mass shooting""?

I would prefer if the site had a list of names or news articles to each shooting, but I understand that would take much more time. We also know that they must be including Jewish under White, since there have been more than 3 (""Other"" category) Jewish mass shooters in the States in just the current decade, much less the examined timeframe.

Yes the guy who was elected despite the media being strongly biased against him (as evidence heavily by the Democrat leaks which show obvious collusion) and against a person who basically cheat ed her way to winning the Democrat primaries is somehow the ebemy of democracy, while those saying he should be impeached because he says stuff they dont like arent. 

Also if your President is loved by the entire world youre doing something wrong. Theres always winners and losers in politics. If everyone likes you then youre probably the push over loser. Youll notice all of the top economies in the world are not know for their universally loved stance. USA, China, Japan, Germany and the UK are the top 5 GDPs. Only one you could possibly argue being liked is Germany (I live in Japan and this place is absolutely hated amongst Asia before you argue that one), and even then a lot of countries in the EU hold a large content for them. 

How you can try to argue a democratically elected president elected by the same means every other president has been is the enemy of democracy is beyond me. Enemy of democracy seems to be you in this case. And nope, being unliked on a global scale is not necessarily a bad thing. The US economy is prospering far more now under tough Trump who refuses to cut his country bad deal than friends with everyone Obama. People need tough leaders, nice pushovers get no where.

What countries in the Visa Waiver program don't have to apply for is the promise of a visa. A visa technically is given to you at the airport and it's a document that allows you to travel freely on US territory. All European countries have to get this document at the airport, e.g. all EU countries have to get visas. In fact, not being in the Visa Waiver program is better than being in it - a promise of a visa, stamped by the US Embassy or Consulate in some country greatly boosts your chances of getting a visa at the airport, to almost 100%. Meanwhile this chance is lower for members of Visa Waiver countries, and they can get bitterly surprised. We can't. Also, we aren't in the Visa Waiver program not because they don't like us. They don't give enough fucks about us to dislike us lol. We simply aren't part of it because we do not meet the requirements - we exceed the visa application rejection limit.

&gt;A polarização é a pior coisa que pode acontecer para a economia. Tudo se torna simbólico. Você começa a se opor a determinada política simplesmente porque ela está associada a um partido de esquerda ou direita. Os debates estão se tornando cada vez mais difíceis. Ambos os lados, ao invés de debater, gritam uns com os outros. Eu gosto de me descrever como um pragmatista.

&gt; Hoje, quando olhamos para os países ricos, em sua maioria, eles praticam o [livre comércio](https://brasil.elpais.com/tag/comercio_libre/a). Por isso, é comum pensarmos que foi com esta receita que eles se desenvolveram. Mas, na realidade, eles se tornaram ricos usando o protecionismo e as empresas estatais. Foi só quando eles enriqueceram é que adotaram o livre comércio para si e também como uma imposição a outros Estados. O nome do meu livro, *Chutando a escada*, faz referência a um livro de um economista alemão do século XIX, [Friedrich List](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_List), que foi exilado político nos Estados Unidos em 1820. Ele critica a [Inglaterra](https://brasil.elpais.com/tag/inglaterra/a) por querer impor aos [EUA](https://brasil.elpais.com/tag/estados_unidos/a) e à [Alemanha](https://brasil.elpais.com/tag/alemania/a) o livre comércio. Afinal, quando você olha para a história inglesa, eles usaram todo o tipo de protecionismo para se tornar uma nação rica. A Inglaterra dizendo que países não podem usar o protecionismo é como alguém que após subir no topo de uma escada, chuta a escada para que outros não possam usá-la novamente.

- Winston Churchill, 1940

The Second World War saw a rise in the usage of theropod warfare, a most dangerous and innovative field of technology and barbarism. Earlier variations included sauropod warfare, which failed spectacularly at the Battle of the Somme, where heavy losses sealed the fate of the whole concept as a mere precursor to the slightly more ornithischian armaments. It was towards the end of the First World War that turreted Ankylosaurus and other innovations proved instrumental in pushing back German forces along the Western Front, due to the involvement of the United States.

However, during the Second World War, the ambitious Nazi Germany unveiled its theropod divisions and the Blitzkrieg, in which weaponized theropods into machines such as the fast Spähcompsognathus and the deadly Panzerkampfraptror. Such endeavours were only made possible by the expansion of the Japanese Empire into China and Mongolia, where technology sharing treaties and dinosaur trading gave rise to these machine monstrosities, which proved most useful in the Invasion of Poland and France in 1939 and 1940 respectively.

Despite the successful track record of theropod warfare, even mechanised dinosaurs could not endure the infamous Russian winters that halted Napoleon's conquest of Europe, with history repeating itself as the reptilian nature of the theropod divisions forced them into inactivity and military defeat. The failure of Operation Barbarossa is largely attributed to this. 

When the Allies faced advanced German firepower, they responded simply. It was clear they had to produce weapons of greater caliber. The French dinosaurian armament programs fell apart during the war, but British efforts succeeded in protecting the skies of the Isles and giving the German Luftwaffe a run for their money by putting Dimorphodon Spitfires against Pterodactylus Messerschmitts.

Over in the Pacific, the Japanese Empire fought with the United States through mediums of sea and sky. Plesiosaur battleships and nothosaur cruisers clashed in naval skirmishes while Ichthyosaur and Mosasaur submarines exchanged fire below the surface. Due to the lack of native Japanese pterosaurs, German Pterodactylus Messerschmitts could be identified in almost every aerial battle with the United States, which possessed Curtiss Pteranodons and Boeing Quetzalcoatluses.

&gt; the general shape and coverage is a very slight evolution

What we have [here, as you described,](https://images.halloweencostumes.com/blog/files/2011/9/18th-mens-fashion.jpg) with knee-length coats, and high-calf length trousers, does still have the general shape and coverage that I claimed it did.  The trousers are shorter, but the entirety of the leg is covered with relatively close fitting garments. The coat was longer, but it still had the full length sleeves with buttons, lapels, etc, that modern jackets do.  The neckwear is definitely simplified, and the entire ensemble became much simpler and more elegant (thank you, Beau Brummel), but [general silhouette](https://i.pinimg.com/236x/3e/ef/b8/3eefb803f16804186610b497ba25ba42.jpg) is not *that* different from [modern suits.](https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/european-american-suit-infographic/)

Now, compare modern women's business attire (especially the type that is likely to lead to women being cold).  You have skirts that expose the entire leg below the knee, and blouses that sometimes do not reach the elbow, let alone the wrist.  Yes, even in the 18th Century dresses showed off the decolletage, but that was from a time when women's ""business"" was finding a husband (seriously, WTF, the past).

The style of [that sort of business attire](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41fy1%2B2KEiL._US500_.jpg) evolved from that line of social advancement, and it still looks it.

Some hot topics after the Strasbourg's debate

1. You can shove that MCV and Schengen joke somewhere.

2. The romanians decide for themselves what kind of politics we want to have as a sovereign state.

3. We will never give Constanta's port to the Dutch. Tough luck.

4. Your multinational corporations have to pay taxes in Romania and no longer take all the profits outside the country.

5. If the rights and freedoms of the romanians are whimsy for Brussel then the EU no longer stands for us. (something less relevant here)

6. Our gendarmes are better than your gendarmes but they are less paid and get criminal records ordered by the parallel state 

7. It's the right of the romanians to choose what our constitution says about the definition of family. We did not lecture you when you allowed all this rubbish nonsense back at your home, a little decency would not hurt. The  God is seeing you.

8. As long as I only see Dutch, Italian, French, German companies that  auction and buy everything in Romania, and you accuse us that we are corrupt, the EU is just a story for  the gullible. Especially when you make secret trades with Russia and you take cheap gas from them to trick us.

9. We as a country  pay taxes to the EU  more than we get back from the EU as European funds.

10. Our lands are good, our resources are good, our money are good, the romanians you exploit out there are useful to you, but we are disturbing you. We paid billions to EADS and then you  tell us we are not allowed into Schengen? Tough luck.

It's time to think seriously about what is good for Romania. We humiliated ourselves enough for Mr Timmermans's salaries and benefits. Don't you think you stole enough from us to  lecture us?

Theresa May is the beneficiary of low expectations. After last year’s debacle – a coughing fit, a collapsing stage, a conniving prankster – her speech will be deemed a success merely for avoiding this fate. (""You’ll have to excuse me if I cough during this speech; I’ve been up all night supergluing the backdrop,"" she quipped.) 

But the address was stronger in other respects too; the problem is that it was delivered by Theresa May. The Prime Minister’s rhetoric, as so often, was undermined by her record.


In an early section, she denounced the toxic abuse increasingly directed at politicians, not just Jacob Rees-Mogg and his family, but “the first black woman ever to be elected to the House of Commons”: Diane Abbott (who “receives more racist and misogynist messages today than when she first stood over 30 years ago”).

Some people, May said, “have lost sight of the fact that political differences are not everything.” But these words would have been more powerful in the mouth of a politician who was not responsible for the “Go Home vans”, the “hostile environment” (a policy May issued no apology for) and the attack on “citizens of nowhere”.

May's most significant announcement by far was the promise of an end to austerity in next year’s Spending Review (“A decade after the financial crash, people need to know that the austerity it led to is over and that their hard work has paid off”). Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, who pledged the diametric opposite in his own speech, may have other ideas, but May's words were a mark of how the Tories now fear Labour and of how the centre has shifted leftwards. Jeremy Corbyn's assertion last week that his party represents the “mainstream” and the new “common sense” was entirely validated. 


When the Prime Minister gave her first address as Tory leader, Corbyn was largely ignored. But in common with her colleagues, May has been forced to take Labour seriously. “However bad the Labour approach is, we must do more than criticise it,” she conceded. “We need to show what this Conservative government is doing to address people’s concerns.

To this end, May pre-empted the Spending Review by confirming her promise of £20bn more for the NHS by 2023/24 and the abolition of the cap on council borrowing for housebuilding (a policy borrowed, appropriately enough, from Labour). Yet the former follows the longest period of austerity in the health service’s history (with no explanation as to how it will be funded) and the latter is a sensible but belated measure. Why, one was moved to ask, did May not give this speech in 2016?

May cast herself as a figurehead for “decent, moderate, and patriotic” people “appalled by what Jeremy Corbyn has done to Labour”, and hailed “the heirs of Hugh Gaitskell and Barbara Castle, Denis Healey and John Smith” (“not on the frontbench”). Yet if May’s party was truly the centrist force she describes, Labour MPs would be lining up to join it (as Tories did in the New Labour era), not discussing creating their own.


After the Brexit vote, the Prime Minister had a genuine chance to be the unifying figure she spoke of but, by unashamedly embracing Leave populism, she choose the politics of division. At one point, she derided Labour for “not acting in the national interest, but their own political interest” over European policy. But the Prime Minister who called a needless general election, in the hope of inflating her majority, cannot credibly level this charge.

For the Conservatives this was, to borrow a May coinage, the “just managing” conference. Faced with the epic task of Brexit, and burdened by a discredited Prime Minister, the Tories cannot achieve the political and intellectual renewal they so visibly need.

In this uninspiring context, May’s speech was a success. But, as she knows, her reprieve will not last long. The Prime Minister must now win the approval of both her party and the EU for a Brexit deal – a truly Sisyphean task. Though May fears Labour, the most immediate threat is posed by her own side.

First the most important information, I have written a bit about me further down.

* I am usually playing in the evening and on the weekend
* My spoken English is not the best but it will suffice I hope (also I am pretty shy)

I currently have a clan but most of them do not play Destiny anymore and did not come back with Forsaken. Therefore I am looking for a new chapter. I have not experienced the glory of Destiny 1 but I have gone through the bad and good times in Destiny 2; I have witnessed the glory of the Prometheus Lens, wrecked some people in Crucible with Fighting Lion as soon as season 1 and have grinded out all the Factions and Moments of Triump in season 3. I actually have done many things this game has to offer but never got to do much late game stuff (currently catching up for example with Escalation Protocol gear). I got to fight in Trials of the Nine not more than once, finished the Leviathan only on normal mode, never even finished the other raids.

I am looking for people to play with, especially end game activities. I am mostly looking for the chill, fun and experimental part in PvE and PvP activities but can also be pretty competitive when it is getting to serious PvE or PvP.

Each flawed in their own ways, to be sure, but each close enough to the desired results to be branded a success in their own right.  For Tony to fail where the others had succeeded would be preposterous, especially considering that this is a man who - take this with a grain of salt as you may - became an overnight expert in thermonuclear astrophysics.

As to why he hasn't, it's simple, if two-fold.  Even geniuses stand on the shoulders of giants.  NDT wouldn't be where he is had it not been for Hawking.  Hawking wouldn't be who he was were it not for Einstein.  So it goes.

It's true that Tony's defied the odds before, but we're dealing with a problem that has only had one reasonable solution for the seventy-plus years that it's existed.

Now that the game is 1.0 ready these issues should be long gone. When I first got the game 6 months ago the matchmaking was prompt and didn't mess about. Its a shame to see micro transactions put into the game ahead of gamebreaking
fixes. This tells me that the game will never be fixed especially as the ps4 version is made and released and company resources are diverted towards that. 

I'm glad blackout is coming out. It looks and runs pretty good and looked good fun from the streams I was watching as well as having first person play and hopefully this games matchmaking won't take the 30+ mins to find a server in squad play. 

All you had to do Bluehole is fix the matchmaking and disconnection issues and people would be happy. We dont need new maps, guns items etc. We need a game that works for everyone.
