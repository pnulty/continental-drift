Não dei ""piti"" nenhum. Vc deve ser muito sensível.

&gt; Se dicionários, livros que definem palavras, não servem de argumento para você, então você está fazendo revisionismo. Se você inventa suas definições eu não tenho como discutir, pois não sei quais são suas definições pessoais.

Não serve de argumento porque não explica como chegou àquela conclusão. Você, por exemplo, escreveu um monte de lorota sobre ""socialismo"", mas o Michaelis diz que é ""toda doutrina que prega um sistema econômico e político que se fundamenta na socialização dos sistemas de produção e no controle estatal dos setores econômicos."" Ou seja, tudo o que vc disse é invencione e bate de frente com o dicionário.

E quando um autor diz uma coisa, e outro diz outra coisa? Vc confia em qual? É o mesmo caso que debatemos.

&gt; Hitler dizia ser de direita

Ele se dizia socialista -- como ele era --, anti-capitalista, anti-burguesia e anti-marxismo, assim como Anton Drexler e Goebbels.

O Programa do Partido Nazista (que vc mesmo pode buscar e ler) pregava que o Estado deveria sustentar a população; que todo mundo deveria trabalhar não para sustento e benefício próprio, mas para o bem-estar de todos (coletivismo puro); que qualquer renda de herança (ou semelhantes), especulação e afins fosse abolida; a nacionalização de empresas à força; a divisão do lucro de ""grandes empresas"" com o povo; expansão em larga escala da Previdência alemã; reforma agrária que proibisse a especulação.

Ele é tudo o que vc chamou de ""esquerda"".

&gt; O racismo e o fascismo são características da extrema-direita porque são pontos de vista conservadores levados ao extremo.

A União Soviética era racista com judeus, poloneses e ucranianos, e levada ao extremo. Che Guevara dizia que ""negros têm pouco apego ao banho"" e que eram ""indolentes"". Fidel Castro mandava gays para campos de concentração.

Seu argumento (""são características da extrema-direita"") é ruim -- a não ser que vc considere todos estes como ""extrema-direita"".

&gt; o conservadorismo é a manutenção dessas tradições e é parte do que caracteriza os movimentos de direita

Che Guevara era conservador. Fidel Castro era conservador. A URSS era conservadora. Vc viu meus argumentos ali em cima.

&gt; A URSS não era de esquerda: ela era de extrema-esquerda

Extrema-esquerda não faz parte da esquerda? Extrema-esquerda é direita agora?

&gt; Não é de se espantar que você considere qualquer ditadura ou intervenção estatal como ""esquerda""

Eu nunca disse isso.

&gt; Hitler se declarava abertamente de direita

Em que fonte? Qual a página do ""Mein Kampf""?

&gt; é esquecer que no passado o preconceito e a discriminação contra gays, negros e judeus era normal.

Aos 72 anos, ela estava internada desde o dia 8 de janeiro no Hospital Pró-Cardíaco, no Rio de Janeiro. A causa da morte ainda não foi divulgada. Nota publicada na página de [Facebook](//brasil.elpais.com/tag/facebook/a) da cantora informa que ""Nossa querida Beth Carvalho partiu hoje as 17h33, cercada do amor de seus familiares e amigos"".

 ""Beth deixa um legado inestimável para a música popular brasileira e sempre será lembrada por sua luta pela cultura e pelo povo brasileiro"", diz a nota, que segue: ""Seu talento nos presenteou com a revelação de inúmeros compositores e artistas que estão aí na estrada do sucesso. Começando com o sucesso arrebatador de 'Andança', até chegar a Marte com 'Coisinha do Pai', Beth traçou uma trajetória vitoriosa laureada por vários prêmios, inclusive um [Grammy](//brasil.elpais.com/tag/premios_grammy) pelo conjunto da obra"". A mensagem diz que os dados sobre o sepultamento serão informados assim que possível.

 Beth Carvalho chegou a fazer um show deitada em 2018, por conta de problemas na coluna. Quando deu [entrevista ao EL PAÍS](//brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2016/03/11/cultura/1457714455_460596.html) em 2016, a cantora já se recuperava de problemas na coluna após passar um ano hospitalizada — em 2009, ela cancelou uma apresentação durante o show de réveillon na praia de Copacabana, por conta de dores no corpo. Três anos depois, a sambista faria uma cirurgia nas costas. 

 Na entrevista de 2016, a ""madrinha do samba"" falou sobre política e sobre os mais de 50 anos de carreira. ""Antigamente o som do samba era mal gravado, tecnicamente falando. As gravadoras pensavam que era botar um bando de negros lá dentro e diziam: 'vamos lá, batuca aí'. As pessoas não tinham noção de que você tem que ter um microfone para o surdo, tem que ter um microfone para o tam tam, entendeu? A coisa era mal tratada pelas gravadoras. Elas não entendiam o samba. Eu, [Martinho da Vila](//brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2015/10/06/cultura/1444133060_905753.html), nossos produtores, os técnicos, fomos responsáveis por essa melhora.""

 Proveniente da zona Sul do Rio, Beth Carvalho se destacou no samba quando o gênero era ainda muito masculino e ligado aos negros e aos moradores das favelas cariocas. O apelido de ""madrinha do samba"" veio do lançamento de nomes como Zeca Pagodinho, Arlindo Cruz e Jorge Aragão, e de seu trabalho de resgate de cantores como Cartola e Nelson Cavaquinho. ""Eles sofreram muito, eram pobres, melhoraram, modéstia à parte, comigo. Muita gente pensava que o Cartola estava morto e ele veio à tona e a minha gravadora contratou ele, e passou a ter um disco por ano. Com [Nelson Cavaquinho](//brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2016/02/19/cultura/1455836576_674066.html) foi a mesma coisa. Não ficaram ricos, mas a vida deles melhorou bastante. Que é o justo, né?"".

 Entre as várias notas de pesar publicadas pela morte da cantora,se destaca a da escola de samba Mangueira, uma das paixões de Beth Carvalho. ""Com muita tristeza no coração informamos a toda nação verde e rosa que nossa madrinha, Beth Carvalho, nos deixou essa tarde e foi para o andar de cima levar sua alegria junto aos mangueirenses Cartola, Nelson Cavaquinho, Carlos Cachaça, Jamelão entre outros bambas do samba (...)

I’ve never heard it being politicized until the last few years. And I’m going to be honest, I place that blame squarely at the feet of the DUP. I never heard political mention of it until the ILA, and them saying “well what about Ulster-Scots?”. Which is not only stupid, but counterproductive. 

In my opinion the two shouldn’t be compared, nor treated in the same way. They both have very different needs. 

The ILA is about trying to make amends for a terrible historical wrong. Gaelic was the native language of the island for millennia. Spoken and adopted by all waves who arrived on its shores, has the oldest form of written language in Europe, and created the first formal usage of what we call ‘surnames’ now. It was forcibly ripped from the county and it has left a deep wound. 

Ullans is a beautiful regional dialect of Scots. But has adopted Irish linguistic vocabulary and syntax into it too, diverging it from Scots into its very unique Irish version. The two should be kept separate and measures should be put in place to actually reinforce that uniqueness instead of just saying, ah, it’s just Scots, and using their words, phrases and syntax. Books, usage and children’s/adult TV shows and radio should be used to not let Scots (From Scotland) overtake it in Ireland. 

The loss of language is the loss of imagination.

[**Ulfric Stormcloak is *literally* Robert The Bruce, King of Scots**.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wars_of_Scottish_Independence#King_Robert_the_Bruce:_1306%E2%80%931328) Torygg, Jarl of Solitude/High King of Skyrim, who Ulfric killed prior the game, is Lord John Comyn of Badenoch. Robert Bruce wanted to be King of Scots, but Comyn also had a claim. Comyn backed Edward of England. Bruce summoned Comyn to discuss their dispute and the potential of a rebellion against England. During the meeting, Bruce murdered Comyn on hallowed ground. This sparked a rebellion, and eventually lead to Scottish Independence from England. 

Though not all of Skyrim id directly tied to these events. Each group can be associated (somewhat) with other groups and events existing and taking place around the same time. The Imperials are the English, the Bretons are French (from Brittany). The High Elves probably represent the French as well to some extent. The Dark Elves likely represent the death of paganism during the Christianization of Northern Europe (Scandinavia specifically) etc.

I suspect this because I'm, kinda, in a similar boat with my dad. My dad, however, is an immigrant from a European country that's had universal healthcare for decades, so he's not scared of the idea. He know it works and would love for the USA to adopt it. However, he also fears that Bernie's voting block is not big enough because he doesn't trust the majority of Americans.

He is of the opinion that the fact that Bernie calls himself a socialist, even a democratic socialist, means he has no chance of being elected President because Americans just have too much of a knee-jerk fear to anything even remotely related to socialism.

So mine isn't scared of Bernie or his policies, he's more scared of how voters will react to Bernie, so that leads him to think that he can't be the nominee if there'll be any chance of defeating Trump...which, ironically, is how I feel about Biden. Luckily, my dad agrees about Biden, so I've only gotten him so far as not voting for Biden in his state's primary even if he doesn't vote for Bernie instead (Warren was is early favorite).

And my dad isn't a low information voter. He is the kind who spends hours online reading about politics after he gets home from work.

The scientific world could never agree on any one ""IQ"" and is continuously trying to improve upon its concepts. How then, in your opinion, can it be a scientific ""fact"" that a certain group has a higher or lower group than another (on average)?

Literally not true, IQ( intelligence quotient) is just any test used to test intelligence, there are multiple IQ tests that are all accepted as a way to accurately measure intelligence, and they are correlate with each-other VERY heavily anyway. IQ also doesn't seem to change much, even with different levels of schooling. You can even get a brain scan to predict your IQ accurately. If you thow out IQ you might as well throw out all of philology too.

&gt;If you make up randomly or arbitrarily (e.g. by skin color) two groups from a population and look for statistic differences, you will most likely find some. That doesn't make it useful to differentiate between these groups, as their makeup is still random or arbitrary. The differences between individuals of humans are far greater than between any made-up subgroup. And they are lower between ""Asians"", ""Whites"" and ""Blacks"" than between certain ""Blacks"" (some African population) and other ""Blacks"" (another African population) or Afro-Americans (which on average have a lot of European ancestry) - so why does it make sense to make up a group as diverse as ""Blacks""?

Races are not arbitrary, You can predict someones race from their genetics accurately 99.7% of the time. The different group-isms of race aren't arbitrary either, if you asked anyone, even remote tribes, to sort people into the different races, they would come up with groups almost identical. We aren't socialized into seeing race either, even babies are naturally racist. [Race is not arbitrary, if you test the genetics of people across the globe, you will see clear genetic clustering depending on where there ancestors are from](https://imgur.com/a/DepIBJY). Even ignoring the science, we would HAVE to group people like this to look for further explanation for the average differences in group outcomes by race.

&gt;The genetic differences between subgroups of humans are comparatively small and not related to skin color

the idea that people only define race by skin color is idiotic, no one calls albino Africans white. Race is usually socially determined by things like Skull shape, height, Hair color, hair type etc. too.

Oh and the average genetic differences in populations can actually be measured by the fixation index, instead of just saying things out of your ass. The fixation index between american wolves and coyotes is 0.153, Equal to that of Europeans and sub Saharan Africans, but perhaps the differences between coyotes and wolves is purely socio-economic, right? Also the average fixation index in humans does correlate with skin color.

&gt;that's why the concepts of biological races of humans has been dropped

Buy who? Your sociology professor? I hope it hasn't bee dropped by everyone because when the next guy needs a bone marrow transplant and gets it from someone from outside his race and dies that will be a sad moment. No it hasn't been dropped, I dare anyone the get ONE SINGLE academic research paper about race that denies the basis of race with substantial quantitative evidence. The truth is that there are thousands of studies proving the basis of race and differences of IQ in the last 100 years, sure some academics will say race doesn't exist frivolously just to stay out of trouble, but any academic who has actually studied the differences between the races, or IQ who says that would be lying.

&gt;But if you put together such a race by completely different parameters, you'd still find correlated differences. And these do not imply genetic causation either, the causes can be nutritional, environmental, really the whole range of socio-economical differences between such chosen groups or ""races"". That's also why some groupings (say between chimps and humans) make more sense than others.

the thing is that people can easily control for every one of these variables, and have. Even controlling for Education and Yearly income the racial IQ gap remains. You clearly know nothing of genetics research and are just regurgitating something someone else said, as any good genetic study can easily determine a causal relationship between someones genes and IQ or whatever you are studying by just gathering more data about the participants, even if they don't know the  specific gene responsible for the difference.

Title: **Husband physically abused me and is threatening my immigration status**

Original Post: 

&gt; I came to the US from Europe a few years ago, met a person I thought I loved, and eventually married him. After a few months, he started to physically abuse me. I have since left him. In court he is saying none of this happened, and is saying he only married me to get me a visa. I don't have many resources, and am not sure where to turn. I don't think I can afford a lawyer, and want to ensure I can stay in the country with my family. Is there a way to get help for my situation? Thank you very much.

Jon Watts said it ( he is the producer and was the one for Homeco), Feige confirmed it recently hence why it’s the last one of the phase. 

 
I’ve read interviews and basically Fury found free child labor, and is gonna recrut Peter to the world of spies. Watts said Fury sees him as an asset and he can’t deal that Peter would rather be a teen basically.

The producer compared it to his own experience when, when you re a teen and you want to get treated like an adult and then you realize that no you don’t want that but it’s too late people won’t let you go back to before. 

And imo that’s basically Peter traumatized by what happened (I think I read back in 2017 or 2018 that he is gonna get PTSD from his experience. Which IMO Endgame hint on with how terrified he looked )  + what happened to Tony, and not wanting to be an all the time superhero. 
The hints being : leaving his suit at home (and his face when looking at it) + Happy saying « You re all alone now » + when Remy Hii character said « Iron Man », Peter immediately turns to look at him but he isn’t happy  

Last but not least Zendaya (who plays MJ)  Instagram story, where she posted a picture of her crying and distraught face after Endgame viewing, where she wrote that it was her reaction and with knowing what she knows about Far From Home. 

All in all, the movie will deal with the consequences of Endgame. The 5 year gap problem between those dusted ( among the students : Flash, Betty, Ned, MJ, Peter) and not (the new kids I guess who weren’t in Homeco) + the war + particularly with Tony’s loss ( seeing as that’s his 4th time loosing someone, and uncle Ben was like 2-3 years ago without the 5 years time spent)   

Edit to say « So nice to finally meet you, Spiderman » could very well be that Fury wanted to meet Peter before,but Tony was preventing him. Watts said he had wanted to introduce Fury as the « mean substitute teacher » even in Homeco. 

Imo Tony wouldn’t have let Fury drag Peter anywhere, let alone to do dangerous work as he expects him to do, so Fury couldn’t have any contact with him nor did he try.

&gt;His stand against Zionism and a Jewish state of Israel on principle has been accused by Laurel Leff of deliberately burying accounts of Nazi atrocities against Jews in the back pages of the Times.

Firstly, which part of what I just said is fascist. Are you saying that because I don't want **invaders** who do nothing else than destroy our society and culture I am a fascist? Because I stand for nationalism I am a fascist? Is that all you can do? Call us a fascists to make us seem like the evil ones?

And then you put in bold that part as if it was a big deal. As if I had said something morally wrong. If you could not infer that by yourself because you are not aware of Europe's current situation then let me make it clear. **I do not call them apes because of their skin colour, which is what you understood, but because of their actions.** 

There is no other word other than ape for someone who only comes to your country to kill your people, rape, acid attacks, terrorism, child trafficking, burn churches, etc. We don't want them here because the great majority of them only do that, and leftists just want more of them here. They kill us for our religion and skin colour and we welcome them. 

Not too long ago, if one those 'refugees' burnt a church, which is a symbol of christianity the religion Spain did so much to protect and spread around the world, almost a symbol of Spain, that 'refugee' would have received untold suffering and probably be burnt alive. Nowadays we greet them and welcome them: 'yay fuck our religion'. Now I'm not saying let's burn 'refugees', hell no, but let's have a little self respect please. 

On top of that they don't even learn our languages, especially in Germany, where more than half of the 'refugees' don't even pass basic German lessons. Or Sweden where less than 10% of the 'refugees' don't want to accept the free basic education they are offered.

I mean if she'd handed you a check, it would still be appalling, but eight fat stacks?! What the hell was she thinking?

Look. I agree in a way that she deserves to lose the money if she's going to be this stupid, and you can get your vasectomy secretly in another month or your wife could get a tubal or bisalp. I don't consider it stealing (it was offered freely but under loose, non-contractual, and incredibly stupid terms). But just be warned that taking that amount of money from people who don't respect your life choices can become its own sticky mess.

Boomer parents with their irrational expectation that they *own* you and you *owe* them grandchildren, are not to be taken lightly. I just read an article today about baby boomers ""mourning"" that they may never become grandparents (THE HORROR!) because *millennals* aren't breeding quite as early or often as past generations, and it was full of quotes from outraged, entitled *angry* people in their 60s who truly believe they are being denied a fundamental right if their children don't produce some grands. ""It's the tragedy of my life!"" said one woman quoted in the article, whose only child is childfree. I think this type of nonsense your mom tried to pull is going to become more common. Expect more people on this sub to say they've been cut out of wills for getting a vasectomy, or offered a much-needed down payment on a house *if they got pregnant*, and other horrifying stories of financial manipulation from deeply entitled, selfish parents. 

So I think your initial instincts to see this as an assault on your independence was correct. I'm not saying don't take the money, necessarily, but I am saying that accepting that amount of money is going to give your mother a strong sense of having one-upped you. If you really have the balls to take it, get the snip in actual secret, and then as the years go by and no grandbabies show up and she gets pushier and angrier and says things like ""I get you *eighty thousand dollars* so that I could get a grandchild!!* (even though that isn't actually what she said) just shrug and say ""But we still use birth control and haven't changed our minds yet,"" then great! I know *I* am capable of bending to financial pressure, since I have a lot of financial anxiety, and the idea of someone being able to look at me and say ""you wouldn't have such-and-such (that down payment, that car, that trip to Europe, that much in your retirement account) without *me*"" would be dangerous for me and my autonomy.

La deuxième, c'est qu'elle a joui au moins une fois et peut être plus (J'ai pas osé lui demander). J'y tenais vraiment et c'était sexy de l'entendre gémir, j'ai toujours cru que c'était un truc de film porno ça.

La mauvaise nouvelle, c'est que j'ai tenu longtemps (35~40 minutes) car je ressentais quasiment rien. Non seulement je n'ai pas joui mais je sentais à peine son vagin. J'ai eu du mal à conserver une érection tout du long, il y a eu des phases demi-molles. On s'est arrêté car ça commençait à lui faire mal.

C'est clairement pas de sa faute, elle a un corps magnifique, des seins fermes à croquer. 

Je ne suis pas sûr que ça soit la capote. Après qu'elle soit partie, j'ai essayé de me caresser pour voir (sans capote) et rien, 0 sensation. J'ai déjà eu de temps en temps des orgasmes très forts en me branlant quand j'étais célibataire donc mécaniquement, tout est censé fonctionner.

À 4h du matin, je me suis réveillé avec la trique, j'ai essayé de me caresser et les sensations étaient revenues.

Pas vraiment compris et un peu inquiet. J'ai trois hypothèses :

* nervosité. Comme c'est la première fois, je me suis bloqué sans m'en rendre compte (pourtant je me sentais bien).

* préservatif : soit c'est pas les bons (j'ai utilisé durex feel thin) soit le latex m'a anesthesié le pénis.

* trop de porno, masturbation. J'ai lu qu'on pouvait s'habituer à jouir d'une certaine manière avec l'habitude d'être stimulé à la main et visuellement avec des gros plans de vagins et de queues. Je m'étais pas masturbé pendant 2 jours avant et étrangement, la recontrer m'a fait bien moins apprécier et avoir envie de me masturber, même avant qu'on fasse l'amour. Là, ça fait 3 jours sans éjaculation et 1 et demi sans porno.

Si vous avez une idée/opinion je suis preneur !

Pour finir sur une note positive, on est resté allongé nus sur mon lit à discuter et à se câliner pendant 1h après et j'ai adoré ça, parler en étant détendus à poil et en train de passer la main sur son corps.

Din fericire tipul a fost mega deschis, a fost de acord sa faca proba si sa-mi trimita orice benchmark  sau stress test am cerut (si am cerut cam tot ce se putea cere) si chiar mi-a trimis serial numberele si a fost de acord sa nu accept coletul daca nu se potrivesc. 10/10 would buy again de la ala desi mi-a mega stat morcovul in cur pana am pus piesele in pc si nici nu se poate vorbi de garantie.

He refers to them as such because that's literally [how they're called](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Greeks) by modern historiography. Medieval Western Europeans themselves generally refered to the Byzantines as ""*the Greeks*"".

The reason being, that, most especially past the 7th century and on, when it was gradually reduced to its strongholds of Greece and Anatolia, **the Byzantine Empire was societally and culturally Greek**. 

That's literally *History of the Eastern Roman Empire 101*.

&amp;nbsp;

Also a chapter of *History of the Eastern Mediterranean 101*, as the entire region had been slowly (but partially) hellenized for a thousand years, starting in the 4th century BC. 

Where it gets funny is that the Romans themselves pretended they were descended from the Greeks (Romulus and Remus were allegedly descended from Aeneas, who fought in the Trojan War) and emulated their culture. The acculturation became even more pronounced after the conquest of Greece and the subsequent, willingful self-hellenization of the Roman society.

In a way, Romans somewhat culturally identified as Greeks. It doesn't mean they actually were.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;there wasn’t a Greek identity around even 500 years after the Sack of Constantinople.

There very much was a [Greek identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Greeks#Identity), not only by 1704, but even centuries before. Greek nationalism, like any other nationalism, is rooted in cultural self-identification. That culture didn't pop out of thin void in the 19th century.

That claim is entirely absurd.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Every Byzantine identified as a Roman

Again, ""*identifying as X*"" is not the same as ""*being an X*"". They identified themselves as Romans because in their eyes, they were the only remaining part of the Roman Empire - which was effectively the case, as the political and administrative continuity wasn't broken until 1204, and then definitely in 1453.

They were nonetheless culturally Greek, and in the medieval ERE, the practical reality of being ""Roman"" was conflated with the Greek culture.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;But it’s the same Youtuber who uploaded a video with the title ‘Ancient Greek kingdom in India’, and of course his gullible audience fell for it.

Calling the audience of that video ""gullible"" is somewhat ironic, when yourself don't know what you're talking about.

There was, in fact, a [Greek kingdom in India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Greek_Kingdom), a stem of the [Greco-Bactrian Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Bactrian_Kingdom), itself a remnant of the conquest of Alexander the Great.

[],Virtuallyalive,1407601100.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_hstnc,False,"Yes, scientific racism was popular in Europe just like it was in America in the late 19th century. 

&gt;The French aristocrat and writer Arthur de Gobineau(1816–1882), is best known for his book An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races (1853–55) which proposed three human races (black, white and yellow) were natural barriers and claimed that race mixing would lead to the collapse of culture and civilization. He claimed that ""The white race originally possessed the monopoly of beauty, intelligence and strength"" and that any positive accomplishments or thinking of blacks and Asians were due to an admixture with whites. 

And further on

&gt;Following the creation of the first society for the promotion of racial hygiene, the German Society for Racial Hygiene in 1905—a Swedish society was founded in 1909 as ""Svenska sällskapet för rashygien"" as third in the world.[105][106] By lobbying Swedish parliamentarians and medical institutes the society managed to pass a decree creating a government run institute in the form of the Swedish State institute of racial biology in 1921.[105] By 1922 the institute was built and opened in Uppsala.[105] It was the first such government-funded institute in the world performing research into ""racial biology"" and remains highly controversial to this day.[105][107] The goal was to cure criminality, alcoholism and psychiatric problems through research in eugenics and racial hygiene.[105]As a result of the institutes work a law permitting compulsory sterilization of certain groups was enacted in Sweden in 1934

A lot of it centres on Anglo-Saxons in England, but there's a lot of quotes

E.g. Churchill

&gt;In 1937, he told the Palestine Royal Commission: ""I do not admit for instance, that a great wrong has been done to the Red Indians of America or the black people of Australia. I do not admit that a wrong has been done to these people by the fact that a stronger race, a higher-grade race, a more worldly wise race to put it that way, has come in and taken their place.""

And Cecil Rhodes

&gt;Rhodes advocated the governance of indigenous Africans living in the Cape Colony ""in a state of barbarism and communal tenure"" as ""a subject race. I do not go so far as the member for Victoria West, who would not give the black man a vote. ... If the whites maintain their position as the supreme race, the day may come when we shall be thankful that we have the natives with us in their proper position.""

People saying that Europe doesn't forget that the driving force behind the colonisation of not only Africa but the Middle East and Asia was ""The White Man's Burden"", the idea that all white people were inherently superior to non-white people. Countries like South Africa and Rhodesia established Apartheid the exact same way as segregation existed in America, while being European colonies. And of course the Nazis views on race are essentially the same as the KKKs. Maybe there's more a distinction between like Slavs and Romani and 'White People' but that's the biggest difference. As for France

&gt;National Front is an extreme-right party which openly claims its nationalist and conservative ideals. This party was initially led by Jean Marie Le Pen, who has often been considered to be the spokesperson and face of the party. Le Pen has been reprimanded many times for racist actions and the National Front has been held responsible for a couple of race-based crimes.[44] For example, in 1995, three militants of the National Front party shot at two young boys of African origins who were running to catch their bus. One of the young boys, Ali Ibrahim, a 17-year-old from the Comoros Islands, was fatally wounded. Bruno Megret, who was 2nd in command of the National Front at the time, stated that this event was due to ""massive and uncontrollable immigration"" in France. He added that he was thankful that his militants had been armed.",True,False,False,,0,1556702659,,1556702977,0,{},em7kvvy,False,t3_bjcrde,False,False,t1_em7govk,/r/todayilearned/comments/bjcrde/til_that_after_becoming_the_first_white_man_to/em7kvvy/,False,,1559409463,18,True,False,todayilearned,t5_2qqjc,r/todayilearned,public,0,

I’d invite a look at [this report](http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/19155938/Restrictions-IX-FULL-REPORT-WITH-APPENDIXES.pdf) from the Pew Foundation. It’s a little dated (2016), bit it shows a fairly remarkable uptick in religious persecution across all surveyed religions. In western and European countries this is especially true for Muslims and Jews, since the most recent onset of nationalist popularity. A glance at the table on page 26 of the Pew report lays out one metric: the number of countries where religiously were harassed. One might notice that Christians are still on the top of that particular list, the sharper increase for other religions notwithstanding.

The table on page 32 of the Pew report is also quite helpful, as it narrows in on the 25 most populous countries, and the incidence of both social and government hostility toward religion in general.

[],ladsen1,1511622275.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_m37jc6m,False,"Honestly, I think the whole issue of racism is highly blown up by the Media. 
I personally live in an area where pretty much 100% have Swedish ethnicity - so my personal experience could perhaps not say too much. However, one shouldn't refer to personal experience too much either way.

What I can say is that people have definitely become more critical towards our immigration policies. Is that the same as Racism? I think not. 
There are plenty of arguments for why people are critical towards it. Should a country, that has a crisis within every public sector, in a globally economic boom, really focus on increasing our population so much? 

A fact is that, a welfare system and huge immigration, does not go well together. The reason why the U.S managed to take in so many immigrants in the past is because they were not a big cost for you guys. You welcomed people here, but told them that it was up to them to get a job etc. In Sweden, we give them everything for free and most of them do not start contributing to society after years. Immigrants women sometimes do not ever do it. It is a huge economical stress for us. 

Furthermore, experts claim helping locally is a lot more effective than geographically relocating millions of people. It just does not make any sense.

Also, that our elderly people get thrown out of their homes so that immigrants have somewhere to stay does not help the polarization in this question. Immigrants even get dental care for free almost, while most of our retired force barely cant afford it. They also get housing easier than Swedish citizens. These indifferences has caused disagreements among people, for sure.

HOWEVER, are we racists? According to World Value Survey we are the most tolerant country on earth with a bit less than 1% of our population have problems with being neighbor with someone of another ""race."" That number is, for example, 40% in India, and 30% in North Africa. Even if we are the country who has taken in the most immigrants in the EU, p/c.

Being sentenced for 10 years for selling it is just ridiculous. Sentences like these are given for murders and stuff like this.

I just think it's ridiculous and the hypocrisy of society when it come to certain drugs is just limitless. Especially when you see a lot of civilised countries, where marijuana is decriminalised and not far away from them, there is somebody serving 10 years sentence.. In the country with one of the biggest alcohol consumption per capita in Europe. I am sorry, it just makes me angry, such hypocrisy and injustice, but I am just repeating myself..",True,False,False,,0,1556712278,,1556712468,0,{},em7toy1,False,t3_bjelw4,False,False,t1_em7t100,/r/soccer/comments/bjelw4/liverpool_ceo_we_proudly_sing_that_weve_conquered/em7toy1/,False,,1559413603,5,True,False,soccer,t5_2qi58,r/soccer,public,0,

Não sou sequer experiente e certamente no sub especializado você vai encontrar coisas melhores, mas algumas impressões / opiniões:

1. Você está sempre jogando contra a casa

A casa sempre ganha e eles têm os dados de todas as apostas já feitas e equipes especializadas pra definir quanto vão pagar pra cada resultado para maximizar os lucros. 

O bom é que o objetivo deles (e eles são muito bons nisso) é ganhar dos clientes como um todo, não de você individualmente. Isso passa, inclusive, por oferecer retornos mais atrativos que os concorrentes e que incentivem as pessoas a jogar. 

O seu objetivo é conseguir vencer individualmente num jogo cujas regras são adversas (você tem bem menos que 50% de ganhar jogando na média). 

Como? 

O cálculo deles é principalmente matemático. Então você tem que recorrer a uma informação que o computador não usa ou analisar melhor que ele as informações disponíveis. 

A galinha dos ovos de ouro seria jogar dados numa planilha e achar uma fórmula que te desse palpites lucrativos no longo prazo de forma consistente a partir desses dados. Evidentemente, isso é muito difícil, ou as casas quebrariam. Até pq são públicas as estatísticas de futebol e das odds de aposta no passado. Então, em teoria, você pode testar essa fórmula com o que aconteceu antes pra ver se funciona, sem risco. 

Você não sendo um gênio da matemática, o diferencial pode ser uma análise técnica / tática do jogo melhor do que as outras pessoas e, em alguma medida, a boa e velha intuição. 

Por exemplo, é provável que eles vejam o CSA (por enquanto) como outros times da Série B que subiram em condições parecidas. 

Se o CSA for mais saco de pancadas do que esses, apostar contra ele pode ser lucrativo. Acho que o seu plano vai nesse sentido. 

Mas... A inteligência artificial pode não ser humana, mas ela pensa com dados fornecidos por humanos. Indiretamente, ela processa a intuição / análise de milhares de humanos a partir dos dados de aposta. Se de repente todo mundo começar a jogar contra o CSA, a taxa cai imediatamente.

Por isso eu gosto de apostar ao vivo. Tem jogo que você vê que o time fraco tem uma chance legal de marcar num contra ataque... e às vezes isso tá pagando 9x. O computador só tem os números, não está assistindo o jogo. 

2. Mesmo apostando certo, você pode perder pq tá fazendo apostas muito grandes para o seu caixa 

Ainda que você tenha uma fórmula que te dá uma vantagem e na média você esteja ganhando, se você apostar todo o seu dinheiro a cada vez, você vai acabar perdendo. 

Digamos que uma aposta esteja pagando 2x e a chance real de ganhar seja de 51%. Fazendo muitas apostas, você acaba ganhando no total, é uma fábrica de dinheiro. Só que se você apostar 100% do seu caixa, você pode perder de primeira e acabou. Quanto mais pequenas apostas você fizer, mais próximo do 51% de acerto você chega. 

Há fórmulas pra controlar esse risco, procure. 

3. Nunca aposte no seu time

Você pode achar que está sendo racional, mas é difícil separar. Somos otimistas por natureza. 

4. Apostas viciam

Cuidado. Aposta vicia, de verdade, e destrói vidas. Uma aposta de 5 reais pode deixar qualquer jogo sem graça da Série C mais emocionante que final de Libertadores. 

Estabeleça X reais por mês que você dispõe pra gastar com isso e nem um centavo a mais que não seja lucro das próprias apostas. Esteja preparado pra perder tudo. 

5. Apostas matam o esporte

Se individualmente você pode ser responsável e limitar os riscos e efeitos negativos das apostas, para o esporte como um todo é mais difícil. Apostas criam um incentivo constante à manipulação de resultados. 

Enquanto houver apostas vai ter jogo sendo comprado em algum lugar. 

Se isso te desmotiva a jogar ou não é uma questão pessoal. 

Espero que tenha ajudado!

The imperial measurement is actually fairly fascinating. While not as convenient as the metric, it does make sense. For measurements they very often used body parts as a reference. To make things easier they measured the ruler/king as the standard reference, which sounds ridiculous but you need a standard of measurement at the end of the day and who better than the ruler.

A mile for example was made by the Roman Empire as 1000 paces (1609m)

A pace which is a double step is 1.64 yards (149.96cm) 

A Single has Step is 0.82 yards (74.98cm)

Are you thick or just trolling?

I'll name two America or Australia.

The world has an overpopulation problem but the UK doesn't. We have a population centralisation phenomenon which means everybody wants to live in the same place i.e. big cities - London, Manchester Birmingham etc. We still demolish a lot of houses in this country so it can't be as much of a crisis as you think.

You're contradicting yourself because you said Japan doesn't let in immigrants but yet they're over populated. Japan has an ageing population and that's it's problem.

[],Antal_z,1543631101.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_c7wnsbw,False,"Starting salaries I see here in the Netherlands are about EUR 40k, for master's degree in STEM or CS. Compared to \~60k for the US outside of the valley and New York. The differences are also large for tradesmen, like welders, plumbers, electricians etc. They are around 45-50k in the US, and more like 30k here.

It blows my mind that nobody in Europe seems to have a problem with this. It just completely blows my mind. Healthcare is often cited to explain it, but health insurance in the US isn't 10k+ per year, and besides we're talking pre-tax incomes, not post-tax. Our taxes are also far higher than in the US, in every conceivable way. Income tax, payroll tax, fuel, alcohol, VAT/sales tax, everything I can think of. Only property taxes are apparently quite high in some parts of the US.

In my opinion, the reason for the discrepancy is the completely dickered economy we have, europe-wide. Just look at the tech boom of the last 40 years. Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, all worth hundreds of billions, all of them offering thousands of jobs that pay &gt;100k each. Compared to such staggering creation of value, what does Europe put forward? Skype, Minecraft, SAP. Looking on a more macro level, US interest rates are up to 2% now, while the ECB is still at a solid 0. There's no growth to be seen.

Entrepeneurship is dead, which means competition is dead, which means competition on the labor market is also dead. Competition gave the US a Falcon 9, a Falcon Heavy, maybe soon a BFR. What's our answer? Ariane 6. Ariane. Flippin. 6. We have no new players coming up and kicking things up. We only have the same ancient large companies that we've had since the 60s or before. 

Sidenote, people often assert that entrepeneurship is dead because access to capital is poor. This is a copout, it's intelectualy lazy and convenient. Why, pray tell, is access to capital so terrible here?

Ultimately, our taxes are too high, and our regulations are to burdensome and strict. As to the latter part, I can only speak for the Netherlands, but allow me to give one example. Suppose you start a new limited liability company in the Netherlands. You are now an employee of your own company. This means you have to register with the tax authorities of course, but I'll leave that aside for now. What salary will you pay yourself? 45.000 euros. Why you ask? Because the government mandates that you do so. They are afraid that you will pay yourself dividends rather than salary, which is taxed less. The tax service can also mandate higher pay if they deem that ""usual"". How the actual fuck is that supposed to work when most early companies are built largely on sweat equity?

Final sidenote, VAT is much more of a bottomless hellhole than people like to think or pretend it is. If you're in the US, resist implementation of VAT as much as you can.

Stating that the EU is a failed state because it's all about German capitalists abusing cheap foreign labor is so beyond the point. I live in the Netherlands, and we have many Polish and Romanian guys working here, bringing back money to their country. Poland has become so rich that more and more people stay home because they don't need Dutch or German euros.

Nawet Marine Le Pen gdyby dorwała się do władzy to by zmieniła śpiewkę  i zrobiłaby się Madame l'Europe (mais l'Europe nouvelle). Co innego kit dla ciemnego luda a co innego realpolitik. Większość ""anty-europejczyków"" kocha koryto bardziej niż suwerenność.

Do Brexitu doszło w drodze wyjątku:

* Po pierwsze 40 lat polityki anty-unijnej wewnątrz wspólnoty zrobiło swoje. Mem się utrwalił jak zaraza której nie można zaleczyć.
* Po drugie Wielka Brytania nie ma tradycji politycznych na kontynencie, a ma za to marzenia o powrocie do Commonwealthu. To że wrócą jako kolonia nowego hegemona do nich nie dociera (a do niektórych dociera i dlatego chcą).
* Po trzecie Brexit wydarzył się bo ludzie byli sfrustrowani sytuacją gospodarcza - w szczególności szokiem cenowym na rynku nieruchomości który skutecznie trzyma ludzi w ryzach. A to jest problem samej Wielkiej Brytanii a nie Unii. Niestety ponieważ UK to kraj bankierów i landlordów nie wolno mowić o przekrętach na ziemi i dlatego wciska się inne bzdury typu ""imigranci"". Polecam poszukać na sieci - jest projekt ""who owns Britain"" który pokazuje prawdę o tym jak bardzo klasowo wysegregowane jest to społeczeństwo.
* Po czwarte Wielka Brytania zaliczyła większy szok niż inne kraje bo polityka gospodarcza Gordona Browna byla *katastrofalna*. 
* Po piąte za Brexitem popłynęły pieniądze od amerykańskiej prawicy i wspieranych przez nią ludzi na wyspach. Taki Rupert Murdoch siedzi okrakiem i w Australii i w Wielkiej Brytanii i w USA i ewidentnie poczuwa się być lojalnym wobec Waszyngtonu najbardziej (bo tam największa kasa i władza). To nie Rosja a Amerykanie dali impuls bo dla amerykańskiej prawicy osłabienie UE jest z korzyścią dla USA a wyrwana z Unii Wielka Brytania jest fantastycznym celem do skolonizowania. Notabene nam próbują zrobić to samo - Międzymorze to amerykański projekt destabilizacji UE.

Natomiast Polexit w Polsce raz że wymagałby załamania gospodarczego w UE które jednoczesnie nie pogrąży Polski - tak by sprzedać bajkę ""bez unii będzie nam lepiej"" - a dwa wymagałby zainwestowania w Polskę by coś zasymulować. A widać gołym okiem że USA nie chce inwestować tylko szuka frajera.  Pasuje im ze Polacy biegają jak debile na amerykańskim pasku podczas gdy Unia funduje zabawę. Rosja z kolei będzie paradoksalnie Polskę do Unii wpychać tak długo jak Ameryka robi coś w Europie bo wtedy jest bójka między USA a Niemcami o terytorium (vide PiS prowadzony przez USA i PO prowadzone przez Berlin). Dopiero jak Ameryka się zwinie na Pacyfiku Rosja może chcieć dogadywać się z Niemcami. A tu tez Unia jest nam potrzebna by Niemców w ryzach trzymać bo mimo iż prawdą jest że Niemcy na Unii najbardziej skorzystali to jest to też kaganiec który sami sobie założyli. W ramach Unii jak Niemcy podskoczą to mamy opcje - Francja, Włochy, Hiszpania, Holandia...

Dobrze że nie przyjęliśmy Euro. Bo wahania na rynkach by mocno nastroiły ludzi anty-UE. Euro to bardzo chybiony ekonomicznie projekt - przede wszystkim koncepcja polityczna - i póki nie zostanie naprawiony (co wymaga większej centralizacji UE) nie ma co się do niego pchać.

Quantas dessas manifestações realmente acontecem, e quanto dessa imagem é graças a um esforço de manipulação da opinião pública para desvalorizar a imagem do estudante por meio de mentiras? 

Eu já recebi várias correntes na internet denunciando o horror de manifestações nudistas na UFMG, mas em todas elas não só não houve nenhuma manifestação nos dias em questão, como também as fotos que usaram pra ilustrar as correntes foram extraídas de outros lugares. Já vi imagem de campo nudista na Holanda na década de 90 sendo usada como prova de ""protesto Lula Livre na UFMG em plena segunda de manhã, A ESQUERDA NÃO TEM VERGONHA NA CARA"". Isso demonstra que quem critica/denuncia esses movimentos muitas vezes age de pura e simples má fé, então como confiar que todas as denuncias sejam verdadeiras?

- Every router your connections passes through can sniff and log your details.
- If you run e-commerce, anyone who cares about security will refuse to shop on your site. I have often refused to purchase things from websites that don't implement TLS, even if the payment gateway does.

&gt; GENEVA - A European Union trade lawyer fired withering put-downs at U.S. claims for damages due to subsidies for European planemaker Airbus in a recording of a dispute hearing made available by the World Trade Organization on Tuesday.

&gt; The EU lawyer, whom diplomats identified as James Flett, described some U.S. claims in the case as &amp;quot;Frankly childish&amp;quot; and said some of the data appeared to have been provided by Airbus&amp;#039; U.S. rival Boeing Co. The two firms&amp;#039; rival claims have fueled almost 15 years of litigation at the WTO. After both were found to have received illegal subsidies, each side wants to gain the upper hand by winning the right to trade sanctions to compensate for economic damage.

&gt; &amp;quot;The EU is wrong,&amp;quot; the U.S. lawyer told the hearing.

[],JBinero,1420495146.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_kj54m,False,"&gt; Assange's rights under UK law are a matter of UK law and guaranteed by UK law (while in the UK at least). There was never any doubt that his rights under the law would be respected.. What he did do was flee a legal process when it didn't seem to be going his way..

That is incorrect. His rights at that point were already violated multiple times, including the right to the presumption of innocence and a fair trial. Furthermore, if there was no intention to make him face refoulement, the judiciary could have simply made this clear.

&gt; Again, Sweden issued an extradition request, that is totally in line with UK and Swedish law. The UK was happy that Sweden wanted him to answer a charge in Sweden that was appropriate under Swedish law. The fact that the Swedish process for charging and investigating a crime is marginally different from that in the UK doesn't undermine that.

&gt; You make it sound like Sweden was arbitrarily asking for Assange to be extradited without cause, it wasn't, that's pretty clear.

In fact, this is not what European Arrest Warrants are for. Sweden was not able to produce any evidence that the allegations against Assange were credible, and failed to even put any charges. The European Arrest Warrant is not something that should be taken lightly. As the European Parliament put it, this is not something you use against someone who has been charged with multiple car thefts. 

&gt; Yeah, often you do. Even in the UK, usually you are arrested when there is enough information to support an arrest, then the police will investigate further (and you may be released with no further action, or you may be charged..). The extradition process is effectively that, a request to affect an arrest.

There is no evidence, and there was no formal investigation. 

&gt; Sweden requested that Assange be extradited because he refused to return to Sweden voluntarily. Assange then availed himself of the UK court system to fight that extradition. When that didn't work, he breached his bail conditions and hid in an embassy.

Because he had no obligation to go to Sweden. He offered his full support to cooperate with the investigation remotely, as is not unusual for innocent but even citizens under investigation who are abroad to do. 

&gt; There is no way you can look at this and claim that Sweden or the UK breached the law or didn't apply the appropriate process. Assange however deliberately breached the law after giving assurances (And guaranteeing those with other peoples money) and put himself out of reach of both the UK and Swedish authorities..

Whether the law was broken or not is irrelevant. Everyone has a right to a presumption of innocence, and through clever legal manoeuvring Swedish prosecutors and the UK judiciary were able to bypass that right and arbitrarily detain Assange for years.",True,False,False,,0,1556730221,,False,0,{},em8migk,False,t3_bjfnjr,False,True,t1_em8lfwz,/r/worldnews/comments/bjfnjr/julian_assange_has_been_sentenced_to_50_weeks_in/em8migk/,False,,1559427739,0,True,False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,r/worldnews,public,0,

A maypole is a tall wooden pole erected as a part of various European folk festivals, around which a maypole dance often takes place.

The festivals may occur on May Day (May 1) or Pentecost (Whitsun), although in some countries it is instead erected at Midsummer. In some cases the maypole is a permanent feature that is only utilised during the festival, although in other cases it is erected specifically for the purpose before being taken down again.

Primarily found within the nations of Germanic Europe and the neighbouring areas which they have influenced, its origins remain unknown.

We did the shipment through a moving company affiliated with Unigroup Worldwide. Yes, it would have been a bit cheaper to purchase the freight directly but not by much. By using a moving company we didn't have to deal with all the paperwork stateside, rental of the container,  transportation and temporary storage of the container, safe packing of the container, insurance, customs and port fees in Spain, parking permits on our street, and probably more. With everything we had to do to pack, move, find an apartment, bureaucracy to get registered and get IDs here, etc., all while working long hours, I can't imagine if we had to worry about all this. It wouldn't have saved that much money overall. We probably wouldn't have been able to be reimbursed for the couple of items that were damaged (insurance companies typically won't cover self-packers). And the usual moving company conveniences like rebuilding furniture and getting rid of the boxes was worth probably 2-3 weekends of working on that stuff. Frankly, it would have been a nightmare without a moving company.

We also pared back as much as possible, sold a bunch of stuff, and put other things in storage (a family member's basement).

It is the youth party of the PvdA who's full name is 'Young Socialists in the PvdA' and when you sign up for the PvdA you also get the option to become a member if you're below 25. But yeah, they have a separate leadership and they are allowed to have different opinions.

 &gt; Exactly, you didn't define it any way. That is because the only definition possible is ""government doing stuff"" if you would be correct, and that wouldn't exactly be convincing.

Nothing doing something isn't equal to doing something.

&gt; Let me ask you, if the PvdA are socialists then why are the VVD not also socialist? Both parties support capitalism with welfare programs, do they not?

Because PvdA are a social democratic party which called for the privatization of industry and the socializing of private property at some point. They are also a member of the Party of European Socialists and member of the Socialist Internationale. 

VVD are liberals who split from the PvdA because they disagreed with the socialist road they went down right after being formed in 1946. None of the things that the PvdA has apply to the VVD. 

&gt; You literally said that the idea that welfare was invented to keep socialism at bay was commie propaganda. Otto von Bismarck was the first one to introduce modern welfare and according to him it was to keep socialism at bay. So was Von Bismarck a commie or do you take back what you said?

I said that when it comes to social democrats, who helped design the modern welfare state, it's a myth. That's all.

In 2017 the Swedish allegations were dropped. Assange remained in Asylum.

In 2018 America stated Assange was not named under sealed indictment. Then due to a clerical error [publicized](https://pacer-documents.s3.amazonaws.com/179/399086/18919235200.pdf) that he was in fact named in sealed indictment and currently under investigation. Specifically done so until such a time as Assange can no longer avoid extradition

In 2019 Assange is finally forcefully ejected from the embassy against his will and immediately begins procedure to revoke an anticipated extradition. Also in 2019 Manning is re-incarcerated for refusing to testify against Assange and [other witnesses](https://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKCN1PH2UN) are pressured to testify. Meanwhile Sweden considers re-opening its own case.

&amp;#x200B;

Frankly it's *possible* he's been hiding from Sweden. By all accounts he's quite an unpleasant and possibly unhinged person. But the reasons he, his associates and Ecuador all give seem far more rational.

Either he sought international asylum to avoid potential prosecution for investigated and as-yet-unpressed charges regarding an alleged sexual assault with easily disputed intent, consent and culpability, in a country with notoriously low conviction rates for reported rape. For a crime punishable with 2-6 years on average and a statutory max of 10, he remained in a self imposed 'imprisoned' state of asylum for seven years, the last two of which Sweden had effectively dropped all charges. Alongside this he also successfully convinced the political leaders of an entire country and their embassy staff, his associates, and political benefactors around the globe that he was *actually* hiding from something else entirely.

Or he sought international asylum to avoid a country infamous for its refusal to be a signatory to various international agreements on human rights, war, death penalties and treatment of prisoners, that was actively pursuing him regarding crimes it had sentenced his associate to 35 years for and attempted to inflict the death penalty for 'aiding the enemy', implicitly labeling him an enemy of the USA. Seven years on into his self imposed 'incarceration' said country is *still* actively pursuing him, and has imprisoned people for refusing to testify against him.",True,False,False,,0,1556742523,,False,0,{},em984h0,False,t3_bjfnjr,False,True,t1_em8xag2,/r/worldnews/comments/bjfnjr/julian_assange_has_been_sentenced_to_50_weeks_in/em984h0/,False,,1559437892,4,True,False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,r/worldnews,public,0,

It is a question that needs asking: does Theresa May actually think that Brexit voters are stupid? She is certainly behaving that way, apparently convincing herself that the Eurosceptic electorate will welcome [any deal she cooks up with Jeremy Corbyn](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/04/30/theresa-may-preparing-cave-labour-demands-brexit-eurosceptics/), however appalling, as long as she labels it “Brexit”.

The nonsensical, insulting implication is that those who want to leave the EU are as thick, uneducated, and prejudiced as their “progressive” opponents love to claim; gullible fools who only care about ending “free movement”. Fobbing off such half-wits should be easy: just sign a deal, any deal that can be spun as delivering on this one symbolic goal, and they will flock back gratefully.

The reality is that it is hard to know for sure what the Prime Minister is thinking, if anything: she is the most evasive holder of that office in living memory, according to a University of York study. It is easier to gauge the dominant view in the bunker at No 10, now mired in deep, catastrophic denial about the imploding support for the Tories and establishment in general.

As far as the small group of Remainers now running the show is concerned, the public never really wanted to leave the EU: they would have been content with a minor renegotiation focused on immigration of the sort David Cameron was seeking.

 

By that (pathetically low) standard, Mrs May’s deal – even with a disastrous customs union attached, as demanded by Labour – would represent a major achievement, substantially more than Mr Cameron could ever have dreamt of. So how can anybody reject it? Who cares if the EU still sets many of our rules, or if we cannot sign trade deals?

There is no alternative, the Remainers believe: the “philosopher kings” in Brussels have made it clear that this is their final offer, a no-deal will be blocked by MPs and be hated by the CBI, the arbiters on economic matters, and an explicit revocation of Brexit will enrage voters.

It is therefore a no-brainer, they argue: the deal must be signed, at any cost, allowing the past four or five years of our collective political memories to be erased, and what’s left of the Tory party can focus once more on truly important policies, such as banning ice cream vans.

This approach is staggeringly wrong-headed. It betrays an utter lack of understanding of what motivates Eurosceptics, including most Tory voters, as well as millions who see themselves as more Left-wing. It confirms that despite Mrs May joining the Tories in the mid-Seventies, she no longer understands her activists.

Most important of all, it entirely fails to grasp the significance of what Dominic Cummings, Vote Leave’s campaign director, calls “branching histories”: there was a referendum, and Leave won, so everything changed forever. It may well have been that Brexit wasn’t such a salient issue a few years ago, but now it is and the clock can never be turned back.

 

Anything short of a full implementation of what Brexiteers thought they were voting for will be seen as a betrayal: at least 15 per cent of the electorate, and possibly well over twice that number, will never forgive the Tory party. That is enough to annihilate it. This is no longer just a theoretical risk: the success of Nigel Farage’s slick new Brexit Party attests to that. Millions care deeply about leaving the EU, and their anger is palpable.

The political reality has shifted in four fundamental ways. First, the Tory base no longer trust Mrs May: they will not accept her deal, its time has passed. Ratifying it will not finish off Mr Farage, nor will it see his votes return “home”. It’s too late, the government’s narrative is obsolete. When gauging whether or not the deal is compatible with the referendum result, the voters will listen to Mr Farage, whose influence is increasing, not to Michael Gove, whose popularity is decreasing. The Tories are no longer haemorrhaging support because they haven’t signed a deal: it’s because they appear to be dishonest and not to believe in anything.

The second, is that the Brexit Party will stand against all MPs who back the deal: on current polling, over 60 will lose their seats, ushering Mr Corbyn into office. When combined with the Tory grassroots rebellion, and the local elections, my guess is that far fewer Tory MPs will back Mrs May’s deal if it is returned to Parliament. As to Labour, why should it rescue a dying, imploding Government?

The third is that there is now, once again, an acceptable alternative to the Tories for disgruntled Conservatives and Eurosceptics. The Brexit Party appears far more mainstream than anything that came before it, from Veritas to Ukip. Mr Farage has learnt the lessons of Leave.EU, and it shows.

All of which brings us to the most important way in which the landscape has been transformed: the Tories should be talking to Mr Farage, not Mr Corbyn. The only way to stop a hideous hard-Left government and the permanent, catastrophic splintering of the centre-Right is for the Tories and the Brexit Party to somehow unite. That requires a new Tory leader who isn’t scared of no deal, and who can put together an optimistic, electorally successful economic vision that puts pro-growth tax and regulatory changes at its heart.

 

James Kanagasooriam, an excellent political analyst, argues in The Spectator that demographic data shows how a purely Cameronian Tory party would do roughly as well as a purely “national” pro-Brexit one. Mrs May’s attempt at triangulation has satisfied nobody: he says the party should choose one or the other.

I don’t accept that such a choice is required. Tories can still do better than they did in 2017 with pro-business, younger metropolitan voters, while also delivering even more Eurosceptic voters, including in the North. They can unleash game-changing tax cuts and promote entrepreneurship, creating an attractive alternative to Corbynomics; and they can deliver a hardcore Brexit for the Eurosceptics. There can be enough progress to enthuse both demographics, making it possible to forge an election-winning coalition.

The only question now is whether the Tories will opt for a leader with the guts and appeal to build such a broad movement, or whether they have already given up.",True,False,False,,1,1556747486,,False,0,{},em9h7of,True,t3_bjn065,False,True,t3_bjn065,/r/ukpolitics/comments/bjn065/the_tories_should_be_allying_with_nigel_farage/em9h7of/,False,,1559442153,2,True,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,r/ukpolitics,public,0,

By sticking with your tribe, you could protect your scarce resources from outside raiders, or if your tastes ran the other way, you and your tribe could gang up to steal other people's stuff.

Racism per se was not invented until the 15th-16th century. Before that, discrimination was based on tribal things like what city you were born in, what tribe/religion you belonged to, that kinda thing. In most cases, it was not considered hereditary. People did not look at whites/blacks/etc as *a single people.* That still amounted to a fuckton of discrimination, perhaps way more than today, but it was not racist, because the concept had not been invented yet. The Romans would quite cheerfully enslave some barbarian, but if his next-door neighbor swore unconditional fealty to Rome, he could be welcomed as a full Roman citizen. Rome even had a couple of African Caesars.

In Spain, there were Jews who The Church had forced to convert to Christianity, the ""conversos.""

That is, it was decided that Jewishness was *literally* in the blood, and therefore, once a Jew, always a Jew, yea, unto the thousandth generation. ""Purity of Blood"" laws began to spring up all over Europe.

In the 16th century, that concept was extended to the general notion of a ""race,"" a group of people that was biologically separate from other groups, and--conveniently--easily-identifiable by the color of their skin or other such phenotypic traits. Human races do not actually exist in biology, and geneticists and other scientists tossed the notion into the dumpster entirely back in the 1950s (more recently, advances in ancient DNA in the last 20 years have driven an even bigger nail in the coffin of race). Sure, you can group people by white/black/whatever, but the group you produce has no scientific significance, and if your goal is to figure how how people are actually related, grouping them by ""race"" will give you WRONG answers.

Today, people are racist essentially because they have been taught to be.

Only high-class men in this era were allowed to learn writing, but fortunately all spoken Japanese words were represented by Kanji. People of other classes (generally, women in mass) decided to adapt their own simpler writing style to represent the sounds in Japanese and write words, etc. This became the Hiragana system. When later Europeans made their way to Japan, they had phonetics that were difficult to represent using the Hiragana system without confusing one of either party.

We get assaulted by liberals because male genital mutilation belongs in the conversation with female genital mutilation (by the way, they ARE comparable). But they have cognitive dissonance about this so they assume we're anti-feminists (I identify more as a humanist, but hold many feminist beliefs about gender equality, so I am not anti-feminist by any means). The issue w/ liberals is they're more science-minded, so they point to the health benefits re: STDs, UTIs, etc. The issue is the health benefits are backed by poor, biased, and poorly interpreted research.  
  
We get attacked by conservatives because conservative politics and religion really go hand-in-hand. American Christians (most of them), Jews, and Muslims vehemently defend circumcision.

Circumcision is a REQUIREMENT of Orthodox and Conservative Jewish males, not just tradition or a culture.

[],williambotter,1542234059.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_2lm23pua,False," O ministro da Justiça e Segurança Pública, Sergio Moro, disse nesta quarta (1º) que a promessa do presidente [Jair Bolsonaro (PSL) de dar um salvo-conduto a proprietários rurais ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/04/bolsonaro-quer-isentar-de-punicao-proprietario-rural-que-atirar-em-invasor.shtml)para reagirem contra invasores de terras ainda é uma discussão ""prematura"". 

 Questionado sobre esse tema durante entrevista à rádio Jovem Pan, ele evitou se manifestar sobre a proposta, dizendo que ainda precisaria conversar com Bolsonaro. 

 ""São questões que estão sendo discutidas dentro do governo. Antes de ter no papel exatamente o que vai se propor, quais são os limites do que vai se propor e tal, é muito prematura essa discussão"", afirmou. ""Eu, sinceramente, não me sinto confortável em discutir esses assuntos. São questões que eu ainda tenho que falar com o presidente, ouvi-lo, discutirmos e colocar algo sólido no papel"", completou.

 Na segunda-feira (29) , ao participar da Agrishow (Feira Internacional de Tecnologia Agrícola em Ação), em Ribeirão Preto (a 313 km de São Paulo), Bolsonaro disse que enviará à Câmara dos Deputados projeto para isentar de punição proprietários rurais que atirarem em invasores de suas áreas.

 “É a forma que nós temos que proceder. Para que o outro lado, que desrespeita a lei, tema vocês, tema o cidadão de bem, e não o contrário”, afirmou o presidente à plateia formada por ruralistas.

 O salvo-conduto prometido por Bolsonaro para os proprietários de terra que reagirem às invasões, porém, esbarra na Constituição, [segundo especialistas ouvidos pela **Folha**, para quem a medida poderia ser derrubada no Supremo Tribunal Federal](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/05/constituicao-e-entrave-para-salvo-conduto-previsto-por-bolsonaro-a-dono-de-terra.shtml).

 Para eles, embora a Carta Magna garanta tanto o direito à vida quanto o à propriedade, o primeiro tem peso muito maior.

 Bolsonaro adotou discurso radical desde a campanha eleitoral contra movimentos que costumam invadir prédios ou áreas públicas e privadas.

 O então candidato chamou de “bandidos” representantes do MST (Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra) e do MTST (Movimento dos Trabalhadores Sem Teto) e disse que as ações desses grupos seriam tipificadas em seu governo como terrorismo.

 Na entrevista à Jovem Pan, Sergio Moro voltou a defender a permanência do Coaf (órgão de inteligência que atua detectando movimentações financeiras atípicas) sob controle do Ministério da Justiça.

 Há no Congresso um movimento para que o órgão deixe de fazer parte das atribuições do ex-juiz da Lava Jato.

 Moro disse que tem conversado com os congressistas e que nem o ministro da Economia, Paulo Guedes, defende o retorno do órgão ao controle de sua pasta. ""Ele tem uma série de preocupações. Tem a nova Previdência, a questão dos juros, tem que pensar no desenvolvimento econômico.""

 ### Recuos e derrotas de Moro

 **Decreto das armas**  
 Seu primeiro revés foi ainda em janeiro. O ministro tentou se desvincular da autoria da ideia de [flexibilizar a posse de armas](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2019/01/bolsonaro-assina-decreto-que-flexibiliza-posse-de-armas-no-pais.shtml), dizendo nos bastidores estar apenas cumprindo ordens do presidente. Teve sua sugestão ignorada de limitar o registro por pessoa a duas armas —o decreto fixou o número em quatro

 **Laranjas**  
 No caso do escândalo de [candidaturas de laranjas](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/02/entenda-as-evidencias-e-as-versoes-dos-envolvidos-em-esquema-de-laranjas-do-psl.shtml), enquanto Moro deu declarações evasivas, dizendo que a PF iria investigar se “houvesse necessidade” e que não sabia se havia consistência nas denúncias, Bolsonaro determinou dias depois, de forma enfática, [a abertura de investigações](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/02/bolsonaro-manda-pf-investigar-laranjas-e-diz-que-bebianno-pode-voltar-as-origens.shtml) para apurar o esquema

 **Ilona Szabó**

Oppression and the stealing of labor happens regardless. He did kind of like it because he believed the continuing expansion of capitalism would eventually bring its downfall, but he also hated it because he viewed it as a weapon that the advanced capitalist countries use against the weak and poor countries to bully them into entering the capitalist system.

practical free trade; the protective duty is only a palliative, a measure of defence within free trade),
established means of communication and the modern world market, subordinated trade to itself,
transformed all capital into industrial capital, and thus produced the rapid circulation (development of the
financial system) and the centralisation of capital. **By universal competition it forced all individuals to
strain their energy to the utmost. It destroyed as far as possible ideology, religion, morality, etc. and
where it could not do this, made them into a palpable lie**... In the place of
naturally grown towns it created the modern, large industrial cities which have sprung up overnight.
Wherever it penetrated, it destroyed the crafts and all earlier stages of industry. It completed the victory
of the commercial town over the countryside. ...**Generally speaking, big industry created everywhere the same
relations between the classes of society, and thus destroyed the peculiar individuality of the various
nationalities. And finally, while the bourgeoisie of each nation still retained separate national interests,
big industry created a class, which in all nations has the same interest and with which nationality is
already dead; a class which is really rid of all the old world and at the same time stands pitted against it.
Big industry makes for the worker not only the relation to the capitalist, but labour itself, unbearable.**

Later, from Capital, on trade as a weapon of sorts, although it arguably could be about colonies, but Marx didn't give a fuck about brown people so I doubt he cared. 

&gt;The discovery of gold and silver in America, the extirpation, enslavement and entombment in
mines of the aboriginal population, the beginning of the conquest and looting of the East Indies,
the turning of Africa into a warren for the commercial hunting of black-skins, signalised the rosy
dawn of the era of capitalist production. These idyllic proceedings are the chief momenta of
primitive accumulation. On their heels treads the commercial war of the European nations, with
the globe for a theatre. It begins with the revolt of the Netherlands from Spain, assumes giant
dimensions in England’s Anti-Jacobin War, and is still going on in the opium wars against China

Finally, the most explicit he gets, in the Manifesto of the Communist Party, which is really just a more explicit restatement of the previous paragraph

&gt;The bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations. It has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his “natural superiors”, and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest, than callous “cash payment”. It has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water of egotistical calculation. It has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up**that single, unconscionable freedom — Free Trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.**",True,False,False,,0,1556755494,,False,0,{},em9tn43,False,t3_bjffg8,False,True,t3_bjffg8,/r/centerleftpolitics/comments/bjffg8/daily_discussion_thread_may_01_2019/em9tn43/,False,,1559447987,6,True,False,centerleftpolitics,t5_3oilk,r/centerleftpolitics,public,0,

'A ""black and white book of terrorism in Europe"" has just been published on the initiative of a European MEP, Maité Pagazaurtundua, who lists the 753 people killed in terrorist attacks between 2000 and 2018 on the territory of the European Union.

The study also counts ""Europeans who have been victims of terrorism outside the Community borders during the same period"", that is to say 1115 people, whether they are tourists, expatriate workers, humanitarian staff, journalists, agents Armed Forces ... In all, 1868 people were killed, aged from one to 90 years, who are listed in this book, made with the assistance of the French Association of Victims of Terrorism (AFVT). **The vast majority (1,703 people, 91.1%) were victims of ""jihadist terrorism"", with nearly 20% of suicide bombings.**

111 people were victims of ""nationalist terrorism"". Far-right and far-left terrorists killed 14 and 13 people respectively. One person has been a victim of ""animal terrorism"" (for 26 people, the origin of the terrorist act is unknown or without complaint).

In addition to the names of the victims are their age, nationality and profession. The date, the place, the type of terrorism of which they were victims, and the weapon used are also specified. ""Forgetfulness is the worst thing"" and this book is ""the way to remember them"", said Elisabeth Pelsez, interministerial delegate responsible for helping victims of attacks, Tuesday during a press conference in Paris. ""The victims are the dead part, let's not forget the physically or psychically injured, about 10 to 20 people for one death,"" she insisted.

France, just behind Spain, is the second European country most affected by the attacks during the period studied (268 deaths in Spain in the last 18 years, 263 in France). If we add the French killed in attacks outside the EU, 379 people died. Spain and France are also the two countries of the Union to have experienced large-scale attacks, on March 11, 2004 in Madrid (191 dead, committed by radical Islamists) and on November 13, 2015 in Paris and in Paris. suburbs (121 dead, claimed by the Islamic State group).

In addition to the count of victims, the book proposes ""a map of terrorism in the European Union from the point of view of victims"", with several charts depicting the evolution of terrorism over the years, the types of attacks and the type of terrorism.'",True,False,False,,0,1556760073,,False,0,{},ema0biy,True,t3_bjowch,False,True,t3_bjowch,/r/The_Donald/comments/bjowch/jihad_books_literally_the_title_of_yellowcovered/ema0biy/,False,,1559451118,1,True,False,The_Donald,t5_38unr,r/The_Donald,public,0,

(That way being the rostral-caudal organization of the frontal lobe, aka front to back  of the frontal lobe with back being closer to the motor area, but it is not a perfect front to back.  Furthermore it is not just rostral-caudal but also the parallel orthogonal loops of the cortical-&gt;basal ganglia-&gt;thalamus-&gt;cortical and cortical-&gt;pons-&gt;cerebellum-&gt;cortical)

Tx and Fx functions are language games we play, they do not rest in a single brain area but are part of a network of brain areas that are far away from each other but these brain areas converse.

Furthermore besides functions not being limited to a specific brain area how you image these brain areas have all forms of accuracy and precision problems as this image demonstrates.

Notice with fMRI how long / out of date the information is.  Oh you asked a question and the question shows this brain area was light up in the last second, but it does not really tell you how long it was used and so on.

Other neuroimaging techniques have their own limitation for example EEG you can tell based off the millisecond but you can only view brain activity on the outer area of the frontal lobe (no medial frontal lobe, no basal ganglia, thalamus, brainstem, etc) and it lacks precision of space even though it is more accurate on a temporal frontal.  What do I mean by this?  The EEG can only tell a general area this brain area was active but it can measure changes quickly, but brain cells can be very different in what they can do even if they are a fraction of an inch next to another brain area.

never said they couldn't, and it's not like they have control over that anyway, they just end up either suffering or beneffiting from whatever their government does


&gt;Secondly, relying on your domestic market is more expensive than relying on an international market. If Greece were to have moved their production from abroad to the domestic market, inflation would also have occurred.

I'm not denying this, I'm just saying if you're in a position where you're barely selling anything even if you're not concentrating on your exports, you might devalue just so you can sell more exports anyway. anyway, the main issue here isn't whether devaluing your currency works or not, but whether a country gets its own say or joins the euro


&gt;Third, countries will a lower standard of living like Greece benefit from countries like Germany with a higher standard of living, because they can produce cheaper and sell for more. Germen workers aren't competitive compared to Greece ones. What is competitive though is German infrastructure. Your argument that rich countries can make higher quality products is nonsense because to them, given the same circumstances, producing a product is more expensive than in a country with a lower cost of living.

yes in terms or labourers german workers are clearly more expensive, but in terms of exports germany flies very high. It is possible that germany has certain goods that it makes which can be sold globally at a competitive rate due to their devalued currency whilst having relatively expensive workers. for example, germany are known for good cars, so they are selling a premium good for a little cheaper than it should be.


greece on the other hand will struggle to be able to afford the human and physical capital required to make premium goods despite having the cheap labour, but they wouldn't have the funds to afford all of the resources anyway.


&gt;Different EU countries have different minimum wages. This means poorer countries can produce goods cheaper and then sell them more expensively in rich countries. 

they can only produce goods cheaper if they can afford the capital and labour to produce said goods, I'm sure that FoM coupled with free trade can make that tricky with foreign business able to operate anywhere within the single market at a rate that's cheap for them abut expensive for the locals.


&gt;This would not be possible without a single currency.

&gt;The lower developped countries are the ones that benefit the most from the EU. Their growth has been astronomical, especially when compared to their peers that did not join the EU.

## Sanskrit

**Subreddit**: r/sanskrit

**ISO 639-1 Code**: sa

**ISO 639-3 Code**: san

**Location**: India; Uttar Pradesh state: Allahabad, Jaunpur, Kaushambi, and Pratagarh districts; Delhi and other urban areas; revival efforts in villages.

**Classification**: [Indo-European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language)

**[Wikipedia Entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit)**:

&gt; Sanskrit (IAST: Saṃskṛtam; IPA: [sə̃skr̩t̪əm]) is the primary liturgical language of Hinduism; a philosophical language of Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism, and Jainism; and a literary language and lingua franca for the educated of ancient and medieval India and Nepal. As a result of transmission of Hindu and Buddhist culture to Southeast Asia and parts of Central Asia, it was also a language of high culture in some of these regions during the early-medieval era. Sanskrit is a standardized dialect of Old Indo-Aryan, having originated in the second millennium BCE as Vedic Sanskrit and tracing its linguistic ancestry back to Proto-Indo-Iranian and Proto-Indo-European. As the oldest Indo-European language for which substantial written documentation exists, Sanskrit holds a prominent position in Indo-European studies.

The differences between a Fascist and  European liberal/American conservative are numerous. The Fascist will increase regulation and state control of key industries, Indeed, their desire is to create where private industry is, ""everything for the state, nothing outside the state, nothing against the state."" The fascist will not support rights to freedom of religion, speech, self defense, or due process. 

Its not really all that interesting to examine the policy differences between socialists and fascists, because they are so similar, its more interesting to examine their motivations and why they fight so much. It is because of outgroup preferences. For further reference please see this post that explains it much better than I can.

To their credit, the ANC does try to govern correctly, but is generally pretty bad at it. they will get 50 something percent of the vote.

&amp;#x200B;

The DA is also has roots in the struggle against apartheid, but they were the ""white resistance"" and even though the party is pretty multi-racial they are still veiwed as a white party by a majority of the country, and since people vote on racial lines, and the white population is less than 15% of the total pop.

To their credit, the cities they currently run are very well managed. they will get 20 something percent of the vote.

The EFF is a relatively new party, if you are angry about something, this is the party for you. they want to change the country to socialist, and maybe drive the white people into the Sea, they aren't sure about that, some of them say they would rather shoot the white people and others are nicer and just feel that they must just handover their possessions and land and go back to Europe peacefully.

Tirpitz was the second of two Bismarck-class battleships built for Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine (navy) during World War II. Named after Grand Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, the architect of the Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy), the ship was laid down at the Kriegsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven in November 1936 and her hull was launched two and a half years later. Work was completed in February 1941, when she was commissioned into the German fleet. Like her sister ship Bismarck, Tirpitz was armed with a main battery of eight 38-centimetre (15 in) guns in four twin turrets. After a series of wartime modifications she was 2000 tonnes heavier than Bismarck, making her the heaviest battleship ever built by a European navy.After completing sea trials in early 1941, Tirpitz briefly served as the centrepiece of the Baltic Fleet, which was intended to prevent a possible break-out attempt by the Soviet Baltic Fleet.

I'm less sure on what to do in terms of identity matters. I hope love and understanding of being many things (and also a unique person underneath all the identifiers) will be enough when maybe one day they will be looking for a pre-chequed box to fit into. Neither of us have really had that need before, but I see lots of people who are coming of age in this era struggle with their identity in ways that we never did - I don't have a strong connection to the country/ancestry I did not grow up in, and my wife has a solid identity as her ancestries even though she grew up in the US. I'm not sure what is ""better"", and if there even is such a thing.

About the smaller artifacts, I'd say no, there's no need to return anything. There are thousands if not tens of thousands of beautiful Greek pottery in the world, Greek museums couldn't possibly display even 1% of that, so it makes more sense to keep them dispersed in the world for educational purposes. I think that most people would agree with this. I'd return a part of them only in cases where the country of origin doesn't even have anything to showcase, if the colonists/invaders/etc took or destroyed literally everything. But I don't know if such a situation actually exists.

Of course, it's with the masterpieces that the debate is more complicated. The country of origin wants to showcase the very best of its culture, but these are often also the main pieces in other countries' museums. As others have said, returning a masterpiece to a very unstable country would be a big no-no in most instances, but the issue is that nobody can know what countries will be unstable in the future. Western Europe, where many of these artifacts are situated, wasn't exactly very stable less than one century ago, and there's no way to know what will be the situation in one century from now.

There is also another issue, and that is the issue of the legitimacy of a country to appropriate an ancient culture. Modern Egypt certainly doesn't look one bit like the Egypt of the Pharaohs. Modern Greece isn't the same as ancient Greece. Iraq has almost nothing to do with the Babylonian empire. Why would modern peoples have any claim to ancient artifacts? They didn't make them, their parents or grand parents didn't make them. There's no way to know if their ancestors made them, as peoples moved during the subsequent centuries. So I think that the legitimacy of countries of origin could be challenged, but that's a difficult call to make. What is certain is that culture is a social construct and peoples like to depict themselves as successors of other peoples, with claims often more grounded in a nationalist discourse than in reality.

Finally, and probably most importantly, we have to think about the impact these masterpieces have where they are compared to what they would have where they'd be transferred. The Elgin marbles, hung several meters above the ground on the Parthenon would certainly be in a more authentic situation, but how useful would they be, seen several meters away, from the ground? Aren't they better in one of the most visited museum on Earth, for educational purposes? Again, I'm not saying they shouldn't return. Actually, as they are part of a building that is still standing today, they are probably the more legitimate artifacts to return in the world. I just say this so that everyone thinks about where these pieces are the most useful in the grand scheme of things. After all, when something is such a masterpiece that it is deemed *World* heritage, isn't it the heritage of every Human on Earth?

So what? The ideas are still wrong and racist. The fact they were widespread once shows how racist society was then. That is no excuse for a favourable review ignoring this now. What is more the book claims that this is a factor driving imperialism.

&gt;like i said, if you are a member of the labour party, you are a member of a party based on anti-capitalism that was shot through with what we now know are antisemitic conspiracy theories. many celebrate keir hardie, without ever mentioning his antisemitism (""""modern imperialism is really run by half a dozen financial houses, many of them Jewish, to whom politics is a counter in the game of buying and selling securities”).

Which is most concerning. Especially given how far antisemitism has reached of late.

&gt;the tacit understanding is that he was ""of his time"", and we know better now, that his ideas were simply coloured by the beliefs of the day, but the basic principles hold regardless. which they do. how could anyone in good conscience follow a party based on his beliefs if they didn't believe they could be divorced from his prejudice? and no, you don't need to introduce that caveat every time you bring up keir hardie.

Again, if it was just the author that would be one thing, but it was his work that used antisemitic ideas as arguments. The text itself is antisemitic, and ignoring this or excusing people ignoring this frankly enables such bigotry to remain. Even today many hold onto the notion that Jews are inherently rich and control the world's banks, being over-represented in and controlling many areas. This must be addressed for the modern reader. Someone today writing a foreword should comment on these issues.

You can discuss the ideas but you must separate the constructive from the destructive elements. 

How do you fail to realise that you are already going much further than Corbyn did? You show how simple it is to point out that such ideas were the product of their time but are wrong, yet Corbyn could not in spite of writing a full foreword for the text.

&gt;it doesn't make you a racist if you read oliver twist and don't point out that fagin is the most appalling antisemtic stereotype (although, i also think it is more than fair to point that out, the novel repeatedly calls him ""the jew"", so it is pretty unmissable). should dickens be consigned to the scrapheap of history, written off as an appalling racist? i mean, he absolutely was. you could do that, or you could choose to ignore the problematic stuff as ""of it's time"". neither would be ""wrong"". or you could hold both of those opinions, accept the good, and reject the problematic. again, that's not ""right"" or ""wrong"". there is no ""correct"" way to read history.

Or you could when discussing the man point out his bigotry, separate that from the good things he did bring, and at the same time not fawn over works that were racist uncritically.

You really don't get it. You can criticise a person's racism and still discuss the constructive ideas they did bring. You can do this for their works. But to do this, you must address the issues and not pretend that they don't exist.

&gt;like i say, we recently had a debate on this (revisionism vs contextualism) about churchill. it is helpful in my view not to have a binary view of history, reducing it to good guys vs bad guys. by the morality and understanding of today, there are very few who are ""good guys"" with no caveats.

Indeed, which is why you must discuss the caveats, the issues, for a more complete understanding and to clamp down on racism today.

&gt;back to this text though. like i say, it's thrust is the view of imperialism driven by capital. it's called ""imperialism: a study"". it's not an incorrect view of imperialism. the link between imperialism and capital was real. the analysis was important at the time and still holds today in many ways. i don't think it makes you racist to ignore the stuff that's based in the prejudice and ignorance ""of it's time"", and focus on the underpinning ideas.

Actually it does, or at least it shows that you don't really care about bigotry enough to consider it a problem. If you accept the entire book's arguments and claims as Corbyn did when praising them, then you are choosing not to address the problems, but to treat them as with the rest of the ideas and promote them. In a time when bigotry is rising everywhere, this is incredibly irresponsible at best.

&gt;i mean, the take away from this book wasn't that it was a big book of antisemitic conspiracy theories and hobson was a hate preacher until literally yesterday. before that, it was a book in the ""20th century liberal tradition"", ""worthy of study"", and part of a bbc series on ""great british ideas"":

Germany, which went all-in for renewables, has seen little reduction in carbon emissions, and, according to our calculations, at Germany’s rate of adding clean energy relative to gross domestic product, it would take the world more than a century to decarbonize, even if the country wasn’t also retiring nuclear plants early.

For the money they spent on renewables, they could have been COMPLETELY co2 free for energy generation.

&amp;#x200B;

France replaced almost all of its fossil-fueled electricity with nuclear power nationwide in just 15 years; Sweden, in about 20 years. In fact, most of the fastest additions of clean electricity historically are countries rolling out nuclear power.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm all for renewables and progress, again anything is great.But your picture of renewables is exactly what you accused me of when it comes to nuclear.

Its not just about cost. Its also about scale, we dont just need to replace we need MORE aswell.

I always liked this example to:  Ivanpah solar farm produces 18 times less electricity while using 290 times more land than Diablo Canyon nuclear plant.

That used to be the largest solar farm in the world i believe.

The sheer amount of environmental destruction both to mine the resources to make these solar farms, as well as the land they use is staggering.

Then when they are end of life there is NO solution for their waste.

&amp;#x200B;

But about cost China builds these reactors at one sixth of the cost one would cost in the US.

Probably one sixth of the time to lol.

as a former chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission put it, while France has two types of reactors and hundreds of types of cheese, in the United States it’s the other way around. In recent decades, the United States and some European countries have created ever more complicated reactors, with ever more safety features in response to public fears. New, one-of-a-kind designs, shifting regulations, supply-chain and construction snafus and a lost generation of experts (during the decades when new construction stopped) have driven costs to absurd heights.

&amp;#x200B;

There also is no actual solution for large scale energy storage.

These peak demand plants with nitpicked numbers from when the sun is shining are nice, im all for them.

But when its night these things wont do squat.

How will you generate the needed power then?

2.) It has a multitude of reasons. Brainlets will say ""iTs SocIaLiSm"", when venezuela has a bigger private sector and less state intervention then fucking Norway. The problems started to arise when the OPEC lowered the oil price and therefore crashed the venezuelan revenue which it needed for its expansive social programms. Another problem they had was of course the private sector, which withheld food from the market and bunkered it down in the famous storages that the Venzuelan government seized at the height of the food crisis. A third contributing factor is the US, who imposed sanctions officially in 2015 i think, but has previously been notorious for sending wrong, broken or defective equipment to venezuela, which they NEEDED to keep their oil industry alive. Of course the overreliance on Oil, the monoculture in the country was a pretty bad factor too. A fourth key factor is Maduros insanely dumb decision to turn on the printing press, when the US froze 300 Billion dollars in oil revenue, effectively bankrupting the Venezuelan state. I would say that both decisions (having money in the US and turning on the printing press when that gets stolen by the US) where pretty dumb though i dont know what other options Maduro had. A fifth part is economic sabotage. I think this surfaced most openly when power stations across the country where attacked and shut down or when storages full of food suddenly burnt down, but the government SAYS that such things had already happened before, only then they still had the resources to rebuilt and restack.

I mostly frequent how to subs because that is my interest and then some of the larger subs like funny and pics .. and I will admit yes .. I come here for TD which has also seen problems in the past ... for the past 24 hours I have been fighting off an attack in other subs because users look at my comment history and saw I frequent TD so they think I am an open target that no one will defend... I am not a mod of TD .. I use to Mod CordCutters until some power user/ friend of the admins saw I was a TD visitor and they picked a fight with me breaking sub rules and targeting me directly and the head mod of CordCutters who got his spot because he stole it from the previous creator of the sub decided he would kick me who was #2 mod instead of defending basic sub rules.

&amp;#x200B;

So I say this because this is what is happening on Social Networks

It seems where things were fine for years they no longer are fine.

You can neither have your say or opinion... and if you are on the wrong side of it no one will defend you even if the other person is the one in the wrong.

Its a mob mentality because these ... others... many who have ulterior motives  such as shutting down others more than adding any contribution to the site are seeking a takeover.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically this has happened to twitter. You see even members of congress and verified accounts being locked or quieted or shutdown... 

We have seen people be deplatformed from a group of major sites because of some supposed but non existent  violation on just one site.

&amp;#x200B;

What do they say as a conservative I defend your rights.. and if the content is legal that would extend to NSFW subs which I may not agree with the content but its not up to me to agree if its legal and allowed on the site.

&amp;#x200B;

But Advertisers won't live with it.. they will pull their ads and that is pretty much it.

You have seen what happened to YouTube.

I still know of a female who sometimes shows her family in her videos. Shes from China married to an American and youtube went through and locked all her comments and removed them from her videos basically making her account useless so she hasn't posted for months except one live stream this week where she explained what YouTube did and how she has no way around it and they won't work with her.

But she has done nothing.. its not her fault.

&amp;#x200B;

so thats the way it is today.

&amp;#x200B;

My presence on the internet goes back to about 1985... i had network access through a college.. this was before .com domains.. chats were by telnet not irc.. you had to put your telnet app into binary mode to transfer files because there wasn't any FTP availability.. there wasn't HTTP websites .. news groups were all text and there were only a handful of servers in the world... even on a T3 I would timeout to Japan.

You know that time long before Al Gore invented the internet... 

when it was just people like me building it.

&amp;#x200B;

If this is the decision of reddit to move to a platform where people can't have respectable conversation... where people can't share ideas even if they are ideas you might not want to hear...

If they have to move into that type of situation because of their advertisers

or because they choose to from their own preference.

&amp;#x200B;

The end users.. the mods .. really won't have any input on it

&amp;#x200B;

The internet has changed from the wild west where people believed they were free to a highly monitored and monetized business....

the scrutiny and fine granular detail of tracking is beyond acceptable

cross indexing of platforms, sharing of information without your understanding its not great.

&amp;#x200B;

But this is what Computers do.. this is what they always could do...

people thought they were anonymous but they never were

people thought they had the right to free speech but they never did

you play within the rules or you can't play at all

and heaven forbid you offend the wrong person... 

&amp;#x200B;

So OP I wouldn't worry about what their decision will or won't be because it will be made without your input or negotiation or consideration.

It will either be because of business or the standards of the owners.

But the funny thing is this level of extortion that the left has is effective and the rest of us have no say and you really have to wonder why they are so successful. 

&amp;#x200B;

In reality just like they want to shut down TD they want to shutdown NSFW and maybe not for the same reason but still it is a purpose they have.. political speech .. or maybe offensive speech to some.

&amp;#x200B;

But there won't be places to run to in the future that is the main thing

&amp;#x200B;

If you didn't like facebook or twitter or where ever .. you came to Reddit ... maybe

and then eventually reddit

and then eventually 4chan

and then where ever else

&amp;#x200B;

Its not a matter of IF... its a matter of when and how long

&amp;#x200B;

And if another startup tries to replace these platforms we have already seen that the ISPs the server farms... the network backbones.. 

they will deplatform these companies, take away their revenue 

what  was that site that happened to... hmmmmm 

Gab .. remember they got shut down

&amp;#x200B;

so the whole social network thing .. with China actually putting people on lists.. europe arresting people and jailing them for what we in the USA would consider free speech.. 

it is only going to get worse by many magnitudes

But then maybe people will take their heads out of their phones and computers and start talking to each other .. that is a possibility maybe .. or maybe people will just continue mindlessly and conform .. thats a bigger and more dangerous possibility. 

&amp;#x200B;

you know most of the time i really don't want to see the NSFW Stuff and I guess people don't like other things like Politics or exposing the corrupt and evil.. but

# Une caricature du « New York Times » déchaîne la tempête en Israël

  Dans un contexte marqué par une recrudescence des actes antisémites,  notamment aux Etats-Unis, le quotidien américain a présenté des excuses.  

&amp;#x200B;

Les Israéliens ont profité de la semaine de Pessah (Pâque juive) pour  se reposer des polémiques incendiaires qui ont émaillé les derniers  mois, jusqu’aux législatives du 9 avril. Ce répit s’est achevé de façon  brutale, le 27 avril.

Dans la matinée aux Etats-Unis, un  homme de 19 ans, John Earnest, a fait irruption dans une synagogue près  de San Diego (Californie) et a ouvert le feu, tuant une personne et en  blessant trois autres.

Au  cours de cette même journée de samedi, les réseaux sociaux israéliens  s’enflammaient en raison d’un simple dessin satirique publié 48 heures  plus tôt par le prestigieux *New York Times* (*NYT*). Un  dessin ni drôle ni pertinent, à la tonalité antisémite incontestable,  ressemblant si peu aux normes du quotidien américain. On y voit Donald  Trump, portant des lunettes noires d’aveugle et une kippa, tiré par un  chien au visage de Benyamin Nétanyahou, avec une étoile de David sur le  collier.

## Erreur et excuses

Au  lieu de se focaliser sur le profil du tueur de San Diego, la latitude  dont disposent les suprémacistes sous la présidence de Donald Trump ou  l’antisémitisme blanc classique et ravageur, la plupart des  commentateurs en Israël ont regardé ailleurs. Ils ont fait assaut de  propos outragés sur le journal américain, très lu parmi les faiseurs  d’opinion et les décideurs de l’Etat hébreu.

On réclama des excuses à la *« Grey lady »* (surnom du *NYT*),  une enquête interne, des sanctions. On s’émut, une nouvelle fois, de la  dérive de la gauche libérale américaine, notamment parmi la diaspora  juive, qui ne saurait maîtriser son zèle, dès lors qu’il s’agirait de  critiquer le gouvernement israélien.

La réaction du quotidien a eu lieu en deux temps. Il a tout d’abord mis en avant une simple [*« erreur de jugement »* ](https://twitter.com/nytopinion/status/1122143162506596354)à l’origine de cette image *« offensante »*. Mais devant le déluge de condamnations, il a décidé, le lendemain, de publier un nouveau communiqué.

Un éditeur du *NYT* sans supervision suffisante serait seul à l’origine de cette publication, dans la version internationale du quotidien*. « Ce genre d’imagerie est toujours dangereuse, à un moment où l’antisémitisme monte dans le monde entier »*, a reconnu la direction, en présentant des excuses.

Le ministre israélien de la sécurité publique, Gilad Erdan, a associé la caricature à la *« propagande nazie pendant l’Holocauste »*.  Habitué aux provocations sur Twitter, avec le silence encourageant de  son père, Yaïr Nétanyahou a pour sa part implicitement mis en cause le  quotidien, comme source d’inspiration du tueur de San Diego. *« Certains  rapports disent que le tireur de la synagogue Chabad disait que Trump  était l’esclave des juifs. Je suis sûr que le dessin dans le* NYT *n’a rien à voir avec cela. »*

## Attaques en règle contre le quotidien

Le 27 avril, encore moins subtil et plus énervé, il écrivait ceci dans un autre message, à l’attention de la rédaction du *NYT* : *« Vous êtes un journal antisémite ! Le* NYT *a délibérément  caché les informations à propos de l’extermination de millions de juifs  en Europe pendant la seconde guerre mondiale ! »*

Ce  même Yaïr Nétanyahou avait publié sur sa page Facebook, en  septembre 2017, un montage aux relents antisémites, semblant indiquer  qu’une conspiration expliquait les problèmes judiciaires de son père.  Une conspiration avec à sa tête le milliardaire philanthrope juif  d’origine hongroise, George Soros.

Le fils du premier ministre n’était pas le seul à remonter le temps dans ses griefs contre le journal. Dans le quotidien pro-Nétanyahou *Israel Hayom*  (qui appartient au magnat américain des casinos Sheldon Adelson), le  journaliste Eldad Beck a appelé, en toute amitié confraternelle, à  l’établissement d’une *« équipe d’enquêteurs indépendants qui examineront la position du* NYT *sur Israël depuis la fin de la seconde guerre mondiale jusqu’à ce jour. »*

L’ambassadeur  israélien à Washington, Ron Dermer, l’un des plus proches conseillers  de Benyamin Nétanyahou, a aussi fait référence à l’affaire dans ses  remarques à l’occasion de la journée du souvenir de l’Holocauste. *« Par une couverture biaisée, des tribunes diffamatoires et des dessins antisémites,* \[les\] *rédacteurs en chef* \[du *NYT*\] *choisissent chaque semaine de façon honteuse de présenter l’Etat juif comme une force du mal »,* a prétendu le diplomate.

## Débordements xénophobes

De son côté, le chef du gouvernement israélien n’a pas souhaité en rajouter contre le quotidien américain*. « La communauté internationale doit intensifier la lutte contre l’antisémitisme »*, a recommandé Benyamin Nétanyahou sur Twitter, en réponse à l’attaque de San Diego.

Le  premier ministre a promis de convoquer cette semaine une réunion  spéciale – on ne sait précisément avec qui – face la recrudescence des  attaques antisémites.

Chaque propos ambigu ou  caricatural de Mahmoud Abbas, le président de l’Autorité palestinienne,  est relevé et dénoncé dans la seconde. En revanche, la vigilance de  « Bibi » semble bien moins forte, sur ce point, lorsque les débordements  xénophobes se produisent parmi ses alliés politiques et leurs  soutiens : Donald Trump, refusant de condamner les suprémacistes blancs  défilant à Charlottesville (Virginie) en août 2017 avec des symboles  nazis, ou bien Viktor Orban, le premier ministre hongrois.

I really hope this is true, but you need to bear in mind that the majority of Labour constituencies voted Leave, the vast majority of Tory constituencies voted Leave, and many MPs just want the whole thing over with. Party leaderships have real power over ministers and shadow ministers with future career progression and therefore big sums on the line, even if they just convinced the loyalists, along with Labour MPs in Leave constituencies, it might well be more than half of Parliament.

Not to mention there's the EU elections that both parties would rather avoid, and the future threat of the Brexit Party in not just those, but in a future GE.

&gt;And then on top of all of this is the fact that any magical deal would probably be unacceptable to the EU, or to the DUP. If you want a frictionless border between IE and NI, and a frictionless border between NI and GB, then you have to apply the same basic set of rules in GB as you do in IE, and hence the rest of the EU. The EU is only willing to bend the four freedoms for the sake of NI alone. NI alone can and will get a better deal than the whole of the UK, because the EU knows that NI is a manageable problem unlikely to cause major distortions and able to be managed from a legal perspective.

The EU has always said it's open to changing the political declaration to include in a CU in a few days, it's not legally binding and they know that we'll have even less leverage in future talks once we're outside of the EU. There are an increasing number that just want us out in the transition period.

I'm not exactly an expert, but a CU means we have to abide by many of the same rules as we do now, doesn't it? And Labour want us to be forced to set EU minimum standards as a baseline in UK law, and the Tories want us to sign up to the EU's state aid rules, both are pretty stupid ideas given that we have no say, but I doubt it will be much of a problem in any agreement.

&gt; Again, it is important to remember that the reason we're in this complete mess is that there is no acceptable outcome given the current set of red lines across the UK and EU. 

I completely agree. The Irish border that barely featured in the campaign has forced our country into 'vassalage', with a Brexit that's even worse than anyone imagined in the referendum, forced on us because it's in the short-term interests of our political leaders and party unity, only possible because no one actually understands trade and customs including our own MPs, with Brexit becoming this religious issue about values so disconnected from any economic argument that people just want 'over with' because a campaign did some effective lying to a generation in 2016 that will be gone in a decade.",True,False,False,,0,1556800447,,False,0,{},emb7c6h,False,t3_bjtbml,False,True,t1_emb54a2,/r/ukpolitics/comments/bjtbml/may_prepares_to_keep_eu_customs_rules/emb7c6h/,False,,1559471319,2,True,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,r/ukpolitics,public,0,

The Sportpalast speech (German: Sportpalastrede) or total war speech was a speech delivered by German Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels at the Berlin Sportpalast to a large but carefully selected audience on 18 February 1943 calling for a total war, as the tide of World War II was turning against Nazi Germany and its Axis allies.

It is considered the most famous of Joseph Goebbels's speeches.  The speech was the first public admission by the Nazi leadership that Germany faced serious dangers. Goebbels exhorted the German people to continue the war even though it would be long and difficult because—as he asserted—both Germany's survival and the survival of a non-Bolshevist Europe were at stake.

It's a council election... these guys decide what day of the week the bins get collected on... whatever the outcome it isn't going to be a fatal blow for anyone. If anything a drubbing for the conservatives will heap pressure on May to stand down almost certainly for someone much more Brexity like Boris Johnson to take over, since that is what the party membership (who choose the leader) want. Likewise, the outcome of the upcoming EU elections is unlikely to prove decisive since the vast majority of the vote is going to go to 3 parties that support Brexit; the aptly named Brexit party, the Conservatives and of course Labour.

It really seems to me that it is increasingly likely that the chain of events will go something like this;

* Conservatives get a drubbing in the local and EU elections
* May is forced to stand down by an irate party membership sometime in May or June
* That party membership then elects a hard-brexiteer to replace her
* That hard-brexiteer still cannot overcome the fact the current parliament will not commit to any particular Brexit outcome and more time would be needed to prepare for a no-deal outcome
* Therefore they opt to hold a general election... only this time with a new face that isn't Theresa May, and on a single-issue of Brexit 
* Ironically this would be the sort of election the Conservatives *wanted* to fight back in 2017, but were instead forced onto domestic issues like austerity/public sector pay and failing services. There is a good chance the Conservatives could actually extend their majority - helped by labours ongoing reluctance to actually spell out a firm position on Brexit and a 3-way split emerging in the leftwing vote along remain (lib Dem/ChUK) *vs* socialist (labour) *vs* nationalist (Plaid/SNP) lines.",True,False,False,,0,1556803544,,1556803990,0,{},embbwvh,False,t3_bjtzzr,False,False,t3_bjtzzr,/r/ukpolitics/comments/bjtzzr/todays_vote_must_give_the_conservatives_the_fatal/embbwvh/,False,,1559473465,4,True,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,r/ukpolitics,public,0,

UserID = Unique user id that only the user knows, not a secret, but you shouldn't really tell this to anyone

UserPWD = Your (usually short) password to your online banking system.

With these two you get access to your online banking system, but you can only do some basic stuff that requires your identity to be known. Like send an appointment request, or something like that.

Now, if you need to pay a bill or transfer money to a friend you need to provide a security PIN from your credit card sized piece of (foldable) plastic/paper. The security card usually contains few hundred predefined random keys. All transfer of account related operations need to be authorized from this list. Application asks for a random code from a list that is generated at random (and sent to you via secure post or you can get it from bank).

Each value can be used only once.

So you have a 2FA authentication scheme that is separated to two distinct parts. The online one (UserID-PWD combo) and the 'paper' one which is the list of secret keys. This has been in place in Finnish banks since about 1996-1997.

To crack this thing you need access to all three and the access to that piece of paper is (obviously) the hardest one. Now, the EU in it's wisdom is going to 'outlaw' paper lists, since they can be \*copied\*. Yep, we certainly know that computers cannot be hacked so banning the external secret lists and replacing them with purely online ones is inherently safer.

The stupidity burns. I've been using these lists for over 20 years. They work from any terminal. If you don't have a mobile, just a computer/terminal that small piece of paper is everything you need.

&amp;#x200B;

Additional info: We actually have a 3FA system, since when any of the major variables change (your device / IP / area / usual amount of money transferred / etc) the bank sends an additional SMS to your mobile phone with another secret from the list. So in order for an attacker to transfer money from my account s/he would need my

&amp;#x200B;

Esse relatório foi utilizado pelo próprio COI. Então, claro que é ferramenta política, deliberadamente falsa com o objetivo de inflar mortes por homofobia, mas ainda assim ferramenta política.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Está 88% errado *de acordo com a metodologia da LIHS,* da qual até eu discordo. A LIHS não aceita o argumento do suicídio (que eu acho perfeitamente válido) nem o da homofobia estrutural, que existe ainda que o GGB o explique mal. Além disso a LIHS aceita a palavra da mídia e das autoridades policiais como definitiva, o que, francamente, nesse nosso país é de uma ingenuidade até comovente.

&amp;#x200B;

Então a LiHS está errada por ser objetiva e utilizar os dados disponíveis enquanto o GGB divaga e inclui até mortes no exterior?Realmente, se é possível contextualizar o conceito de pós-verdade, sua resposta é um excelente exemplo.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Por que a LIHS não faz melhor? Fica muito feio se dizer ""humanista"" e não aplicar o princípio da caridade interpretativa quando o GGB fala de homofobia estrutural, porque [é facinho descobrir outras fontes sobre o assunto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterosexism). Mas sabe o que é mais fácil ainda? Desprezar o assunto por completo e ficar usando ""homofobia estrutural"" entre aspas, tornando o termo praticamente uma acusação de que LGBTs gostam de se fazer de vítimas -- o que aliás é a tônica desse texto pretensamente humanista.

&amp;#x200B;

Caridade interpretativa e homofobia estrutural não são conceitos objetivos e não fazem parte da DUDH. São termos subjetivos, impossíveis de mensurar e baseados em visões políticas específicas. A LiHS é uma associação humanista e racionalista. Logo, não podemos abrir mão do que é Direito Humano muito menos do uso racional de nossas faculdades mentais apenas para satisfazer nossos ideias políticos, tal qual o GGB.

&amp;#x200B;

successful in the 60s and called the 'Japan of Africa' when it 

was run with french guidance advising them how to run their

western countries without colonies like Sweden, Finland, 

Denmark, are even wealthier per capita than the ex colonial 

powers. And former colonies in Asia are often wealthier per

""How about you call me by my name?"" would be the kind of answer you'd probably get. I mean, fair point - but we're left without an answer. Anyway, a lot of the white/non-black community is left feeling a bit confused (to say the least) about what terms to use, and often can even feel like the term 'black' can be a slur. So it's just avoided. Instead, you use the term 'African American' - which we've been using for so long that we've lost its context. TBH, African American, to many well meaning people, doesn't have anything to do with Africa or with America - it just means 'black person' (in the most PC way possible). 

So, you wind up with (often?) well intentioned people who travel to Europe. Of course, Europe has lots of black people... but probably that person doesn't feel super comfortable using the term black. So, they try to be polite and use the term African American without thinking about what it really means. I'm not saying it isn't goofy (or downright comical), but IMHO there's a lot of underlying linguistics and politics that cause it to happen. Probably, if someone is called out for calling a someone from Scotland an ""African American"" it's pretty eye opening. Travel can do great things for people. Still, it's fucking goofy.

     Zé Ronaldo: inocentado no TJ, mas maculado na mídia   Com as ressalvas de que se eu pudesse optar preferia as desvantagens da juventude, ficar velho, com o peso dos 66, tem lá suas vantagens. Uma delas é a sensatez no ato de observar a trajetória dos nossos contemporâneos eventualmente em apuros midiáticos, como Zé Ronaldo.

 Vereador, prefeito de Feira de Santana quatro vezes, deputado estadual e federal, passou isso tudo sem que nada maculasse sua conduta. De repente, com quase 68 anos, aparece o Ministério Público denunciando-o por supostas falcatruas num contrato de saúde.

 **Nódoa – **Anteontem a 2ª Câmara Criminal do TJ-BA decidiu, por unanimidade, extinguir o processo. Ou seja, uma decisão colegiada, a mais insuspeita, decide que não tem nada a ver.

 Ok. Mas como fica o alarido feito na mídia na hora em que o MP denunciou? O acusado, Ronaldo ou qualquer outro, automaticamente ganha uma nódoa no currículo, especialmente nos registros midiáticos. Ora, estamos na era da sociedade em rede, em que todos falam de todos simultaneamente, e isso inclui o lixo, as fake news, com força.

 Se neste nosso tempo muitos dos nossos coleguinhas jornalistas esqueceram que apurar informações faz parte do beabá do ofício, imagine quando a informação vem de quem tem fé de ofício, como o MP? O pior é que esse jogo acaba beneficiando os criminosos de verdade, que ganham o benefício da dúvida de quem não deveríamos duvidar.

 **As pedidas antes da ponte**

 Marcus Vinicius, prefeito de Vera Cruz, diz que antes de a ponte Salvador-Itaparica chegar, a ilha tem uma série de pedidas urgentes.

 Na lista, um campus da Uneb, UTIs, inclusive uma neonatal, e segurança:

 – Por incrível que pareça, até água nas torneiras e saneamento precisam chegar.

 Ok, mas cá para nós, prefeito. Tirante a água e o saneamento, com a ponte, as demais pedidas chegarão bem mais facilmente.

 **Aeromóvel de Lauro vem aí**

 Mauro Cardim, secretário do Planejamento de Lauro de Freitas, está animado com a possibilidade de Lauro de Freitas ter o Aeromóvel, especialmente depois do seminário sobre o projeto realizado esta semana, com a presença da prefeita Moema Gramacho e do secretário João Leão, cuja estrela foi uma cabine do dito-cujo.

 – Estamos construindo a carta técnica que será levada a Rui Costa. É o passo decisivo do projeto.

 **Combustíveis em ebulição**

 A intenção do governo de permitir que as distribuidoras também façam a revenda de combustíveis está causando grande inquietação entre proprietários de postos de gasolina.

 Marcelo Travassos, diretor do Sindicombustíveis, diz que a experiência nos outros segmentos não é boa.

 – Veja o caso das farmácias. A rede São Paulo, que também é distribuidora, saiu quebrando as pequenas farmácias em todo lugar.

 ***Bahia passa o RN em produção de energia eólica***

 ***A Bahia superou agora em abril o Rio Grande do Norte (RN) em matéria de parques eólicos instalados: tem 156, em 19 municípios, com investimentos global de R$ 15,4 bilhões, contra 152. Segundo João Leão, secretário de Desenvolvimento Econômico do estado, o Rio Grande do Norte ainda lidera em potência instalada: produz 4.053 MW, contra 3.927 da Bahia. Mas também nesse campo a ultrapassagem é mera questão de tempo:***

 ***– Eles têm apenas dois novos parques em construção e nós temos 38, e muitos deles vão entrar em operação este ano.***

 ***Segundo Leão, a produção da energia eólica está causando uma revolução no semiárido baiano porque onde antes não tinha nada passou a correr dinheiro pela força dos ventos.***

**O mapa do Aedes 2**

O mesmo levantamento revela que na Bahia 106 municípios estão em risco e 173 em alerta. No risco, alguns grandes e médios, como Vitória da Conquista, Ilhéus, Itabuna, Jequié, Luís Eduardo Magalhães, Senhor do Bonfim, Guanambi, Jaguaquara e Morro do Chapéu.

Oui, techniquement les tigres sont dans la catégorie des félins mais titrer son article ""Un félin est entré dans une librairie"" n'a pas le même sens si on parle d'un tigre ou d'un chat. Pour moi, si tu dis ""Ce n'est pas la librairie qui est à blâmer"" ben alors ça ferme complètement la discussion sur la censure. Si la librairie avait dit: on organise une conversation sur le sujet X et on se cherche des participants pour en discuter et qu'ils avaient interdit à MBC de s'exprimer alors que son avis était pertinent, je ne dirais pas la même chose. Et encore, pour moi la censure c'est quelque chose de l'ordre public, pas privé. Si tu viens sur le terrain de ma maison me crier des insanités, je pense pas commettre de la censure si je te demande de t'en aller. Si Twitter décide de bloquer un utilisateur parce qu'il dit des grossièretés, ce n'est pas de la censure parce que c'est un site privé (cependant, ça paraît mal en maudit si ton modèle d'affaire c'est d'être une plateforme de discussion libre). Oui, si tu fais de la gymnastique mentale, comme tu dis, tu peux choisir habilement les définitions qui font ton affaire pour arriver à dire que c'est de la censure mais, au final, personne n'a réellement empêché MBC de dire ce qu'il veut et y'a aucune loi ou charte sur la liberté d'expression qui force des acteurs privés à diffuser des propos, des opinions ou des publications privées. Les personnes qui ont causé l'annulation de la conférence n'ont pas gagné parce qu'elles avaient raison de dire que MBC ne devrait pas parler à la Librairie. D'ailleurs, personne n'a dit cela. La librairie n'a pas dit cela, la police n'a pas dit cela, le gouvernement n'a pas dit cela, personne. Personne ne reconnaît aucune autorité aux personnes qui ont dit que MBC ne devait pas aller à la libraire pour prendre part à l'activité. Ce qui a fait qu'elles ont eu le dessus dans cette situation, c'est les menaces de violence physique et psychologiques qu'ont proféré ces personnes. Si un groupe de personnes avaient simplement dit: ""Ne laissez pas MBC parler à la libraire, ses opinions ne doivent pas être prononcées!"", on ne serait pas là pour en parler aujourd'hui. On aurait simplement rit d'eux et passé à autre chose. Ce n'est pas de la censure. Ce qui fait qu'on en parle aujourd'hui, c'est qu'ils ont dit que ""si MBC parle à la librairie, on va s'en prendre physiquement à lui, à vous les propriétaires ou au public."" Le problème, c'est la menace. Dire que c'est de la censure, c'est encourager la perception que nous sommes devant cette situation à cause des opinions de MBC plutôt que parce que des personnes ont fait des menaces. Et ça détourne la discussion de ""qu'est-ce qu'on fait pour empêcher les menaces faites aux personnes qui prennent légalement parole sur la place publique, peu importe leur opinion"" vers ""qu'est-ce que MBC avait à dire qui a causé toute cette affaire"". À mon sens, c'est une partie du problème de notre discussion publique actuelle. Comme nous nous exprimons courtement, sans faire attention aux conséquences de nos mots, notre choix involontaire ou irréfléchi de mot détourne les discussions vers des points non-essentiels. Ici, MBC est non-essentiel, ça aurait pu être n'importe quelle opinion, n'importe quelle personne, les menaces jugées assez crédibles pour annuler un événement, c'est l'essentiel.

&gt; bo nie widzę szans żeby taki patchwork przetrwał całą kadencję w opozycji

Weź pod uwagę, że ktokolwiek by chciał rozerwać to od środka, byłby ogłoszony odpowiedzialnym za porażkę i powrót do władzy. Moim zdaniem to wystarczający straszak. 

Kluczowe są trzy kwestie:

* Na ile posunie się największy, czyli PO. Póki co tutaj jest optymistycznie, bo Schetyna zostawił koalicjantom więcej miejsc (i jedynek), niż się spodziewano.

* Jak koalicja wyborcza się przełoży na mandaty. To jest mniej przewidywalne, bo zależy od wyborców i głosów na poszczególnych kandydatów. Jeśli w wyborach do KE ""przepadną"" (pomimo miejsc na listach) kandydaci PSL albo SLD, to naturalnie w tych partiach pojawi się ferment, i mogą zdecydować o samodzielnym starcie w październiku.

* Czy uda się uzgodnić wspólny program ""minimum"" - o ile w sprawach europejskich to było łatwe (brak kontrowersji, partie-członkowie się zgadzają, do tego może poza Zielonymi zaliczają się do ""mainstreamowych"" europartii), to w krajowych może być gorzej.

&gt; Ba sądzę, że Wiosna prędzej czy później do tej koalicji dołączy z kilku powodów

Pewnym ""testem"", okazją do ""obwąchania się"" byłaby wspólna lista opozycji do Senatu - bo Wiosna nie ma tutaj szans na miejsca (może poza 1-2 jeśli wystawią bardzo mocnych lokalnych kandydatów) startując samodzielnie. Zresztą to by się dało rozwiązać nawet bez formalnej współpracy - ot, umawiamy się że w kilku okręgach Wiosna wystawia kandydatów a KE nie, w pozostałych - przeciwinie.

Do Sejmu moim zdaniem jednak Biedroń pójdzie samodzielnie, i w sumie myślę, że nawet KE nie będzie namawiać go inaczej. Bo tu się akurat zgadzam - o ile suma ""starej"" opozycji =&gt; KE daje premię, to suma KE + Wiosna (w koalicji wyborczej) przeciwnie, zawocowałaby odpływem kilku % wyborców.",True,False,False,,0,1556818320,,1556818802,0,{},emc18bx,False,t3_bjusdb,False,False,t1_emc05r5,/r/Polska/comments/bjusdb/sondaż_opozycja_w_koalicji_z_wiosną_może_zagrozić/emc18bx/,False,,1559485371,5,True,False,Polska,t5_2qiqo,r/Polska,public,0,

But, look: This situation didn't appear out of nowhere, unfortunately. As I see it, there are three tiers of remote work:

**Tier One**, ""I want to work remote right now and damn the consequences"": Lots of people who love travel (I do too!) end up taking the worst sort of remote work to be able to work remotely. They're on fiverr, they're doing low-level copywriting or blog ghost writing, they're spamming blog contact forms trying to sell SEO services. The quality of the work is poor because they don't have skills that merit being paid well. This is, IME, where many digital nomads fall. There's nothing wrong with being here, it's just a tough path to walk and especially tough to work towards FIRE.

**Tier Two**, ""I have a computer science degree and two years of experience"": The people who followed through and acquired marketable skills make some decent money, but nothing awe-inspiring. They can make some progress on FIRE, but what separates them from Tier Three is...

**Tier Three**, ""I have a set of skills acquired over a lifetime that make me a nightmare for someone like you"": People working remote and still making California-style salaries have marketable skills, significant (10+) years of experience, and most importantly, a robust network of people who think well of them and call them regularly to try to lure them into some new company they're at. This is a great place to be, but the thing is, it takes time and an investment in both yourself and in leaving colleagues with a positive impression of working with you over years.

So, figure out which tier you want to be in and get started. If you want to design logos for $5 a piece, hey, head off to Chiang Mai now. If you want to make a living, then gain some marketable skills and get at least a few years of in-office work before finding a job that is ok with full time remote. If you want to make bank, get a degree or at least a decade of work wherein you are constantly showing people that you are easy to work with, kind, and deliver consistently great results. When people come or go, always look them in the eye, shake their hand, and tell them, ""Keep me in mind if there's anything I can ever help you out with, I've really enjoyed working together and would love to do it again.""

Srpska,dark,richtext,t2_hqfa1,False,"&gt;However I disagree that if a state joins EU it becomes an anti-russian nation. Current anti-Russian stance of EU comes from Russian invasion of Ukraine and resulting European sanctions as from EU viewpoint Russia violated Ukrainian sovereignty. Except for this event, EU is not inherently anti-russian and in no way that is a requirement for a state to join. 

The EU would very likely demand that we sanction Russia, which is an anti-Russian move. As for Crimea, yes, what Russia did was illegal, but so what NATO did to us in 1999 as well as their continued support for Kosovo's independence, and most EU members are also NATO members, so they're nothing but hypocrites and have no right to criticize Russia.

&gt;Cosmopolitanism and neo-liberal is arguable, but I don't see how these are negative aspects of joining. One creates a shared sense of identity with the rest of Europe while liberal ideas allows free economy, little restrictions, free movement etc.

We don't need a shared sense of identity with the rest of Europe. Why would we? You're essentially saying we should give up aspects of our own identity, an identity we fought so hard to keep. Especially after Europe turned it's back on us in the 90s, despite all we did for it.

I am not joking when I said I believed South Florida would be a better choice for a permanent Jewish state. I've lived in this region my whole life and across our little peninsula we have no ethnic consistency making it a delightful melting pot of minorities with no majority, leaving Florida proudly united under our shared identity of inconsistency and a bit of crazy. In North and Northwest the majority of our population is Dixie white or Black Americans, here second oldest to our Amerindian Floridians who are fairly integrated into our greater state and greater heritage though still self governing in their majority county (legally a reservation, which means more autonomy, because of a treaty the Seminole tribe made with the federal government, although they have treaties and generally amicable relations between our state government). In Central Florida we have a bit more of a mix, lots of immigrants, mostly from Central America and the New York / New Jersey megalopolis, but also a significant amount of Dixie and Black folk, who are still the majority in North Central Florida but less so in Southern Central Florida when you get to Orlando, where Yank culture is predominant, with a significant Queer minority in that city and also a little bit North of that in Gainesville (where I'm at) as the surrounding predominantly Dixie counties tend to be less open of us organisms who are gay or worse. In fact I'm so fiercely in favor of Palestinian rights because many persons I've known since I was a kid are actually Palestinian migrants whose villages no longer exist as they're now Israeli settlements. We have people here who don't like them but still Florida is just as open a home to the Palestinian folk displaced from their homeland as it is to myself and any Jewish person disenfranchised from their country. In South Florida the East Coast by Miami actually speaks predominantly Spanish, a little north of that is where the majority of New York transplants live and a sizable amount of Jewish folk, although I'm not certain they're a majority. Many more Jewish and European and Yank folk on the southeast coast though. What I'm getting at though is that we're a multicultural state where independence is acknowledged among our many peoples here but we still live fairly well together under one sun and a common identity of absolute inconsistency and this sprawl of modernity that I call home. This I wish to share with you as a model for modern multi ethnic states. We have no culture's symbol in our state flag, we do not legally incorporate heritage for more than discrimination protections. We are not perfect and we do have conduct among our leaders and authority that tends to still sicken me, but we do not militarily occupy minority counties.

His three campaign priorities are alliances, arms, and arms control. He hasn't put forth any specifics because his campaign isn't about becoming President, it's about raising his profile and building relationships with donors.

**On alliances**, he wants to re-think the role of NATO at a time when Russia is conducting round-the-clock political, military, and cyberwar operations against European democracies. His view that ""Cold War"" NATO is obsolete misses the point of the alliance entirely -- the kinds of economic and political integration that would be the subject of his refocus are held in other venues -- and represents a dangerous misread of Russia's intentions in the region.

At the same time, he wants to build a Pacific version of NATO. The move would *absolutely* inflame our relationship with China. Escalating territorial and geopolitical tensions with the Chinese is bad enough, but doing it for no real-world gain is even worse. The United States already has bilateral defense treaties with Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Thailand, the Philippines, Taiwan and Korea. Other major regional players have refused, specifically because they don't want to anger China.

**On arms**, his major talking point is ""spending more on cyberwar than aircraft carriers."" This reflects his muddled view on the Pacific, and further expose his misguided approach to defense policy. The United States Navy wants ten aircraft carriers because it meets our deployment schedule: three at sea, three in port, and one in long-term refit. Building fewer means sacrificing our ability to project power on short notice. Moreover, aircraft carriers are the primary means by which we exert pressure on the Chinese. He wants to increase our defense presence in the Pacific, but cut the things we use to do that.

All of this also falls victim, in the broadest sense, to the same either-or defense policy that has plagued Democrats since the 1990s. It's entirely possible to fund *both* cyberwarfare and shipbuilding, because we're doing it right now. Both Department of Defense and non-military intelligence investments in cyberwarfare have increased every year since it became a line-item in the budget. There are serious equipment and readiness problems in all four branches of the military, and reduction in procurement only exacerbates them.

**On arms control**, his focus is on artificial intelligence, although his themes here are pretty sparse and underdeveloped. It requires a *staggering* naivete to believe China, Russia, Iran, or other would-be hostile states would enter into such treaties, or abide by them in good faith. Rather, the more likely scenario is a feel-good treaty between friendly nations that prevents us from developing the kinds of weapons that will be used against us. This is doubly confusing considering the role of artificial intelligence in cyberwarfare, which is supposed to be his ""big thing.""

A história termina na rede social mais visual nesta quinta-feira, ao mesmo tempo em que as sirenes dos alarmes antiaéreos tiverem soado em Israel por dois minutos para paralisar a vida do país em memória dos mais de seis milhões de vítimas. Enquanto em todo o mundo o Dia do Holocausto é marcado em 27 de janeiro, no Estado hebreu é fixado pelo calendário judaico uma semana antes do Dia da Independência. Neste dia de luto rigoroso, as estações de televisão suspendem a programação e os locais de entretenimento permanecem fechados.

 Se as páginas do [*Diário de Anne Frank*](//brasil.elpais.com/tag/ana_frank) serviram para trazer a memória do Holocausto para as gerações posteriores à II Guerra Mundial, as imagens de [@Eva.Stories](https://www.instagram.com/p/BwzDi11HF5d/) no Instagram aspiram a manter viva essa recordação entre os nascidos no milênio atual. Pelo menos foi essa a intenção do magnata das novas tecnologias israelense Mati Kochavi e de sua filha Maya. Eles não se importaram com os gastos (o equivalente a 20 milhões de reais) para mobilizar uma equipe de 400 pessoas – entre atores, figurantes e técnicos – por três semanas na Ucrânia.

 ""Se queremos que as novas gerações não se esqueçam na era digital, temos de levar a mensagem aonde elas estão"", disse Kochavi ao portal de notícias [*Times of Israel*](https://www.timesofisrael.com/instagram-story-of-young-holocaust-victim-aims-at-new-generation/). ""Cada vez há menos sobreviventes, é imperativo encontrar novos modelos para salvaguardar o seu testemunho."" Sua filha Maya destaca que os dois escolheram o diário de Eva Heyman – que desejava ser fotógrafa e viajar pelo mundo –, entre cerca de trinta textos escritos à mão por meninas judias exterminadas, para traduzi-lo em mensagens próximas da mentalidade dos adolescentes dos dias de hoje. Passadas 14 horas de seu lançamento, a conta acumulava mais de 100 milhões de visitas em todo o mundo, incluindo três milhões em Israel, [segundo a imprensa neste paí](https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-evas-instagram-holocaust-story-goes-viral-worldwide-1001284341)s.

 O projeto já contava com mais de 200.000 seguidores antes de sua divulgação nas redes sociais, graças a uma intensa campanha de promoção mediante painéis publicitários e o apoio de celebridades e todo o tipo de influenciadores. O primeiro-ministro israelense, [Benjamin Netanyahu](//brasil.elpais.com/tag/benjamin_netanyahu), foi um dos primeiros a apoiar a iniciativa. ""Episódio após episódio, a grande tragédia do nosso povo é expressa em sua essência por uma garota, para que o mundo se lembre e entenda"", disse o premiê na segunda-feira em sua conta no Twitter.

 Entre 15 de maio e 9 de julho de 1944, mais de 430.000 judeus húngaros foram deportados pelos nazistas para os campos de extermínio. [Yad Vashem](https://www.yadvashem.org/es.html), o centro de pesquisas e museu do Holocausto, considera legítimo o uso de redes sociais para difundir a memória da Shoah. ""Nós também recorremos ao Instagram, embora de uma maneira diferente"", disse a instituição radicada em Jerusalém, em um comunicado. ""Não basta somente usar materiais históricos relevantes sobre fatos confirmados, mas também é preciso ser respeitoso.”

 ### O drama histórico que aflora nos textos

 O professor de História na Universidade Hebraica de Jerusalém Amos Goldberg, um especialista no estudo dos diários deixados pelas vítimas, destacou em declarações ao jornal *Haaretz* que ""à medida que o tempo passa, o drama histórico emerge de forma mais grosseira nesses textos em uma intersecção pessoal e cultural "".

 Como costuma acontecer nas redes sociais, os *posts* críticos não foram tão comedidos. ""Eu também sou jovem e não preciso que ninguém me torne mais acessível o conceito do Holocausto"", questionava um seguidor de *Histórias de Eva* no Instagram. ""Onde ela recarregava a bateria do telefone? Estou morrendo de vontade de saber"", disse outro comentário sarcástico.

 Também nas páginas do *Haaretz*, um artigo assinado pelo professor de educação cívica Yuval Mendelson investiu contra um projeto digital que, na sua opinião, deprecia a juventude israelense. ""Um relato fictício no Instagram de uma menina assassinada no Holocausto não me parece o modo mais correto"", observa. ""Primeiro, porque é uma demonstração de mau gosto.

You mean a prominent scholar of Islam that knows the Quran and hadith far better than exmuslims that don't even know classic Arabic or the basic sciences of Quran.

Some of the translators actual do use flat elsewhere in the Quran.

This is either not there or an unusual translation as I can't find the verse and neither is it on the pages you've linked.

&gt; (unless those are all misinterpreted)

No, you just made them up and are ignorant of the context, but you never stopped to consider that even though I've pointed it out several time with verses to back my position as to why you are the misinterpreting things.

&gt; I've never seen a spherical bed

It doesn't say the shape is a bed and neither does the context support it is talking about the shape when right after it mentions opened roads, sent raint, brought forth with it various kinds of vegetation i.e. spread out is a benefit as it's mentioned alongside all the other benefits like rain, vegetation etc. Nothing to do with it's overall shape rather how to man it's spaciousness is beneficial for us to live on. Nearly every time spread out is mention benefits to mankind are mentioned and it ask man to ponder on that.

Also not there...yeah, you like to make stuff up. Like your bottom of the earth nonsense. You have source all of one claim yet have made dozens that are baseless.

Yeah because each/all in a orbit implies the earth. If Allah wanted to say they orbit the earth then it would have been said.

Take your pick, none of the transations imply such a thing http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=21&amp;verse=33

...No, the sects has far more to do with political movements rather than interpretation issues.

&gt; that if a man has an orgasm first the son will look more like the father.

Could be true, somebody should test it.

&gt; It also says that date palm fronds don't fall off but that's apparently wrong too.

How is it wrong? They bend down against the trunk when they are dying and stay there i.e. they don't fall off like so many other trees. Of course a strong wind will knock them off, but the statement is quite accurate. It's not like he said never falls or something.

I found someone else saying it besides me: 

""Question: ...Somebody told me if we wait long enough these dead fronds will simply fall off and we won't have to trim them. Is this true?

Answer: No, it is not true unless a very strong wind blows them off and you are prepared to have them look “ratty” until the rest of them blow off.""

Surplus isn't easy. Do you have any sources on the need for energy storage at 50% renewables, because the generally reported figure is about 85% renewables (regularly quoted at conferences across Europe by LCA specialists who work in this area).

In Germany you may get very occasional negative spot prices when grid balancing because of surplus - but this is offered for seconds at a time.

For the last point - To make H2 via electrolysis and for it to be environmentally beneficial you must use low fossil energy, otherwise you don't save carbon. So you need a consistent supply of renewable electricity that cannot be used elsewhere more beneficially to reduce fossil fuel use in the system (i.e. you have no feasible way of turning anymore fossil powered electricity plants off).

First-quarter gold purchases by central banks, led by Russia and China, were the highest in six years as countries diversify their assets away from the U.S. dollar.

Global gold reserves rose 145.5 tons in the first quarter, a 68 percent increase from a year earlier, the World Gold Council said Thursday in a report. Russia remains the largest buyer as the nation reduces its U.S. Treasury holdings as part of a de-dollarization drive.

“We’ve seen a continuation of the strong demand from central banks,” said Alistair Hewitt, head of market intelligence at the World Gold Council. “We’re expecting another good year for central bank purchases, although I’ll be pleasantly surprised if they are to match the level seen in 2018.”

As well as regular buyers such as Kazakhstan and Turkey, the first quarter also saw Ecuador adding to its reserves for the first time since 2014, plus sizable purchases by Qatar and Colombia, the council said. The buyers are dominated by countries looking to reduce their dollar dependency, and are typically nations with a lower share of reserves in gold than Western European countries.

Central bank purchases have been a key support for gold, helping to offset lower demand from bar and coin investors as well as from industrial users of the metal. Gold has lost 1 percent so far this year, and was trading at about $1,270 an ounce in London on Thursday.

Inflows into exchange-traded funds backed by gold during January have been wiped out over the rest of the year, with ETF levels now at their lowest in four months.

On the supply side, World Gold Council revised its estimates for the contribution of small-scale, “artisanal,” miners, following a reassessment by its primary data provider Metals Focus Ltd. The sector is estimated to account for 15 to 20 percent of global gold mine production.

In countries such as Zimbabwe, small-scale miners account for more than half the gold production and are a vital part of the economy. Under new guidelines from the London Bullion Market Association, such miners may have a tougher time selling their gold legitimately because some of their haul could be classified as “blood gold” -- produced outside any safety or environmental rules and possibly contributing to such crimes as child labor and slavery.",True,False,False,,0,1556828487,,False,0,{},emcjb6v,True,t3_bjzmb1,False,True,t3_bjzmb1,/r/Economics/comments/bjzmb1/central_banks_are_ditching_the_dollar_for_gold/emcjb6v/,False,,1559493882,2,True,False,Economics,t5_2qh1s,r/Economics,public,0,

Imagine if you were from a remote part of Greenland with only white people. You've never seen a black person, you've kind of heard of them, and ""n----er"" is a common word used in a negative connotation (say it means ""hurt"" since j-p is used to mean ""cheat / steal from""). You have no idea it's attached to black people. 

One day somebody tells you, hey, you might not know this but that word is used as a racist term. It was assigned to an oppressed peoples by those who demean them. It's used to mean somebody who has tendencies to commit crime, somebody who would steal things from you. Sure, those people are the absolute poorest out of their entire region, they aren't properly educated, and they've been kept at the bottom for centuries because people think of them as lesser, but people justified it by using words like that and saying that they clearly had a propensity for crime when those lives forced them to it. In 1993, a mayor of a nearby town says ""I'm no racist, but some n----ers you would have to shoot."" There's no outrage, nobody cares, because everyone thinks less of those people.

You're shocked, and think ""well, *I* never meant it in a racist way. I can still keep using it, right?"". You try and fight for it, you tell people that the intention isn't racist. But it doesn't matter. It's not your choice. It's been a racist term for hundreds of years, you just haven't heard it. Eventually, you probably cave.

This is that exact situation, except sub out the oppression of black people and sub in the oppression of Roma. Also, sub out the outrage others had at you using that term, because Roma people's struggle is *not* anywhere nearly as widely supported as that of black people in the US. That quote involved the slur you're saying isn't racist anymore. Roma suffer a very similar kind of racism in Eastern Europe as black people in America do now, and that term is an equivalent to it. Being detached from the problem doesn't mean the problem doesn't exist elsewhere, and you currently are in a place (online) where tons of those people who have to hear that term used to degrade them can read it.

I'm happy to admit the historicity and contingency even of our idea of ""the West"" - I don't even use the term ""Western civilization"" often, because it's ambiguous and conflates different competing narratives of what it means to be ""Western."" 

Fine, then not your view, but the view you are devils advocating for.

&gt;My point is that, on the understanding of ""Western civilization"" common to the people whom you are criticizing, they have an easy and non-arbitrary explanation as to why the Islamic world is not part of the ""West.""

My point is that it's a pretty arbitrary and naive interpretation of history that doesn't much hold up to closer inspection.

When huge parts of Europe which are substantially and irrevocably influenced by Islam can somehow be European, yet a central portion of their identity and the things which shaped it are not then your model has a serious problem.

&gt;The point is that there is a relatively continuous civilization whose self-understanding has been historically constituted by shared culture, language, ethnicity, religion, and historical experience. 

Of course, this ignores that most of Western civilization is comprised of places that don't have a shared culture, language, or ethnicity. The Romance, Germanic, and Slavic parts of Europe being extremely linguistically and culturally distinct. Each of themselves having highly divergent religious and historical contexts - some being part of nominally ""non-Western"" entities longer than they've been independent of them, and retaining many of those aspects even after the fact.

It's simply not true that ""Europe"" shares a a culture, language, ethnicity, and historical experience. Religion is more debatable, but that's about it. The Balkans, Central Europe, and Iberia have substantially divergent historical experiences, ethnic compositions, languages, and cultures.

If a ""shared history"" is what makes Europe Europe, then why are the Ottomans who were heavily involved, and in many cases pivotal, to many European events and the course of European history excluded (and not just in terms of conflict, but also cultural events such as [the Enlightenment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1hyqpo/how_involvedaffected_was_the_ottoman_empire_in/))? But their Balkan territories still somehow were? Slavic and Turkish are essentially as distinct as Slavic and French, especially insofar as practicality is concerned. Etc, etc.

It becomes a lot of special pleading. We have an idea of what Europe is ""supposed to be"" and we superimpose that onto history. But then when we try to dissociate this ""Europe"" from the rest, we quickly end up in an absolute clusterfuck, where we have to result to all sorts of special pleading to say, ""Yes, yes, Country A is *clearly* European but . . .  Country B is not because factor X is different . . . No, you see, Country C *is* a part of Europe though, because while, yes, factor X is different in Country C, but Country A and C share factor Y, so it's clearly European!"" 

&gt;It's trivially obvious that Spaniards are not Russians, and that each shares in common with other non-Europeans some things that they do not share with each other. But they are both European - they are understood as European by other Europeans, and they understand themselves as European (and no, the fact that Aleksandr Dugin or Dostoevsky like to call Russia a ""Eurasian"" civilization is not a particularly interesting rebuttal; everyone knows this, just like how everyone knows that Thomas Mann did not consider Germany part of the same ""civilization"" as France and Britain. These facts are taken out of context and distorted for pedantic, ideological reasons).

Of course, this is only the case today. If you had gone back a century or two when Russia was trying to ""become European"" you would have a very different view of the matter. Including Russians themselves. Peter the Great took great effort to make Russia ""European"" precisely by depriving it of many of its Russian characteristics (up to and including the Russian language itself). And he was hardly the only one - Russia spent *centuries* debating its identity and whether it was European or something other - and Europe by and large reciprocated this skepticism.

To claim that Russia considered itself European and was considered by other Europeans European is a hell of a hot take and would have been a hell of a take to many people of the period, especially prior to the 20th century.

&gt;Just as an aside, your identification of ""Andalusia"" with ""Spain"" is part of the kind of historical pedantry and obscurantism that I'm criticizing. Everyone knows that the Iberian Peninsula was at one time predominantly populated by Muslims, just like how most intelligent people know that Egypt was at one time predominantly Christian. This is not insightful.

Which misses the point. The point is that this throws a wrench into the whole ""shared culture/ethnicity/history/etc.""

&gt;No European has ever considered the Ottoman Empire part of ""Western civilization"" (or, better, ""European civilization"").

[This isn't true](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7svxcb/are_ottomans_considered_a_european_dynasty/) and [it's really murky](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1uurdw/was_the_ottoman_empire_considered_european_by_the/). Especially during the later periods of their history, the Ottomans were ""European"" in most substantial ways but name and religion. Indeed, they had a significant part in European shared culture and history, had several European-types institutions and reforms, had a European style forms of government and political institutions, and a bevy of other factors.

The Ottoman Turks were, much like Russia, simultaneously and alternative considered ""European"" but also ""Other"". Probably in no small part because the idea of ""Western Civilization"" was by and large a product of the 19th century and the heavily narrativized history of the period and how situationally useful it was.

&gt; The Ottoman Turks lived in areas that were once Roman, and they claimed the legacy of Rome - the Sultan was the Kayser-i Rûm, just as the German kings were Holy Roman Emperors. Sweden was never part of the Roman Empire and never really claimed that legacy. Nonetheless Sweden is part of European civilization in a way that the Ottomans were not.

Of course, this would matter if the argument were that ""being Roman"" (or having been a part of Rome) is what made someone ""Western"" or ""European"".

To build on this point, JA Byfield contends that in Uganda in the 1920s, brewing stayed a male endeavor, because women moving into urban spaces often could not access start-up capital. Additionally, European and African men concluded that women should not be involved in the sale of alcohol.

But, Byfield recounts that women in colonial Nairobi did engage in brewing, driven by similar economic pressures as women in southern Africa.

In the same volume, J M Abidogun recounts the history of  dance halls and beer halls and youth cowboy culture in colonial Tanganyika in the 1950s, including drinking _pombe_, locally produced millet beer.

So, I don't want to over-state the notion that women _always_ became urban brewers. There could be common policies among different colonies, but colonies could also have specific circumstances that meant women did not break into brewing.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_meat#Attitude_of_various_cultures

Horse is commonly eaten in many countries in Europe and Asia.[18][19][20] It is not a generally available food in some English-speaking countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia, Ireland, the United States,[21] and English Canada. It is also taboo in Brazil, Israel, and among the Romani people and Jewish people the world over. Horse meat is not generally eaten in Spain, except in the north, but the country exports horses both as live animals and as slaughtered meat for the French and Italian markets. Horse meat is consumed in some North American and Latin American countries, but is illegal in some others. For example, the Food Standards Code of Australia and New Zealand definition of 'meat' does not include horse.[22] In Tonga, horse meat is eaten nationally, and Tongan emigrants living in the United States, New Zealand, and Australia have retained a taste for it, claiming Christian missionaries originally introduced it to them.[23]

In Islamic law only animals that chew their cud (sheep, goats, cattle and camels (i.e. ruminants and Tylopoda) are considered halal (Sura 6, verses 143-144). Consuming horse meat is not halal but makrooh (from Karaha in Arabic meaning disgust), which means it should better be avoided but eating it is not a sin (as eating pork is). The consumption of horse meat has been common in Central Asia societies, past or present, due to the abundance of steppes suitable for raising horses. In North Africa, horse meat has been occasionally consumed, but almost exclusively by the Christian Copts and the Hanafi Sunnis (a common form of Islam in Central Asia and Turkey), but has never been eaten in the Maghreb.[24]

Horse meat is forbidden by Jewish dietary laws because horses do not have cloven hooves and they are not ruminants.

Context matters though.  This continent is North America where transit ridership is broadly horrible.  Calgary's LRT has high ridership simply because a massive proportion of its transit ridership is on specifically light rail instead of bus or subway.  That does not mean that higher proportion of trips is by transit.  Compare it to rapid transit system ridership and Calgary would not break Top 20 on in North America:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_North_American_rapid_transit_systems_by_ridership

Also size matters.  Calgary is bigger than Ottawa (don't forget that OC Transpo doesn't serve the whole NCR).  Should have more ridership than Calgary.  Yet, Calgary is only about 5 million more riders annually.  And like I pointed out earlier, while 1 in 4 takes transit in Ottawa to work, only 1 in 5 do so in Calgary.  Ottawa has transit usage that would be on par with a European city of its size.  Calgary is basically exceptional by American standards and middle of the pack by Canadian standards.

Everything made in 6 days but at the beginning of that string of verses it says that days to God aren't like days to humans and years pass by in the blink of an eye to God. It also gets the relative ratio of the world to the universe correct in roughly 1/3 (4 billion years old compared to the universe somewhere between 12-14 billion). It also says that the universe was all a ""smokey gas"" before God formed from it the stars and planets. After the big bang space was mostly gaseous clouds of the initial elements formed from the big bang which then collected due to gravity (which is a force we still don't understand) and condensed into stars which would burst in supernovas resulting in new elements which combined to make planets. Among a myriad of other things which I've extensively commented on before. And what are you talking about with the nine year old wed thing? Can you source that? Regardless he wasn't a prophet until he was 40, before that he was just an Arab merchant and the Quran made sure to point out the backwards practices their society had when he was a kid, so recounting a story of when he was a child and was almost wed is just a knock on pre-islamic society and not an Islamic practice. These things aren't hard if you keep reading beyond what you're told to by other people who hate, and have basic critical thinking and comprehensive skills.

Well the age of Ayesha is never mentioned in the Quran, only thing that is ever said is that she was past being done with puberty which usually ends in your late teens. There was a single Hadith very early on that reported she was 9, but it was extremely disputed even when it was written and most other sources claim she was older. Regardless marriage in your teens wasn't uncommon at all at the time anywhere in the world considering the lower life expectancy and that humans physically went through puberty earlier in our history than now.

Clinton had a much smaller margin than Sanders, admittedly - and among the Republican candidates Kasich was the strongest by a wide margin, with Trump 4th or something.

Parties can't force people of their asses to vote, but the most important thing for a campaign, and sign of their competency, is their effectiveness in being able to engage the voter enough for them to vote. Whether they do that by the carrot (hope for change for the better) or the stick (fear for the change to the worse) is irrelevant. The important thing is your effectiveness. The Democrats continually fail to do this. Clintons message was ""more of the same"" and ""vote for me so that I can be the first woman president"". People wanted change, and most (there are of course exceptions) people don't care if the President is white, black, man, female, speaks Latin or Swahili as long as the person are able to resonate with them through their policies.

The biggest influence on the election, from my POV as an European following from afar, was the media without a doubt. And especially the deteriorating quality of the media. The constant exposure Trump got because of sensationalism and wish for clicks, rather than focus on actual policies, which he had none of, is what got him elected.

I always found it strange how much emphasis in Presidential elections are put on the character of the candidates rather than their policies.

Personally I think the whole Russia thing is blown wildly out of proportion. Sure, there might have been some attempted influence, but the range of it is likely minimal. It's an easy scapegoat the Democrats use to justify them losing to such an obviously bad candidate.

Whether or not the world will be a worse place when he is reelected is open for debate. I don't doubt he'll do anything he can to make it happen, but my hope is that 8 years of Trump is the shakeup American politics need to realise how broken your entire system is. If he isn't reelected, then I think it's more likely that the cycle will continue and the divide between Americans will continue to grow until...

And we've never payed for people to come here, which is what the word subsidizing implies.

There are however problems in the country that are a direct result of the horrible immigration policy that we used to have. We have amazing social security, which is great in a system with mostly productive citizens, but very costly when faced with asylum seekers which naturally won't contribute as much to society (statistically speaking ofc). A government report done by pro-migrant economists showed that the average cost of an asylum seeker is 74 000kr/year, roughly 7 700USD/year, over their life time (i.e won't pay back eventually).

Before the migrant crisis Swedish politics were pretty SJW, i.e you weren't really allowed to criticize migrant. However, that has shifted and now there's a lot more talk about their responsibility to the country, rather than the country's responsibility to them. We do have issues with some parts of the big cities being infested with gang crime (it's nowhere near American problem zones afaik, but it's still a disgrace), but the police is trying to crack down on the crime, so we'll see where it goes.

Politically it's also not at all as pro-immigration as it used to be. 21% of the parliament is pro-immigration, while the rest is various shades of against (S, KD and L are for accepting close relatives, a few thousands per year, while M and SD are against all types of immigration at the moment. SD also wants a plan for repatriation). The agenda that's being described in weird media in the US is simply not true. We do have fringe politicians that might fit that description, but they're not even in parliament, so using them as a general representation is not intellectually honest.",True,False,False,,0,1556835405,,False,0,{},emcvdkg,False,t3_bjg46d,False,True,t1_emc2y68,/r/samharris/comments/bjg46d/hate_is_always_local_the_swedish_city_that_said/emcvdkg/,False,,1559499551,2,True,False,samharris,t5_2thqg,r/samharris,public,0,

**Honestly, I can totally see just a regular ol’ human Zemo being the next Big Bad and — wait for it — try to eliminate half the population of humans on earth**. 

Why, and whom? 

He would aim to kill the 3.6 billion who SURVIVED The Snap so that the Snapped/Unsnapped can feel the grief of losing multiple loved ones all at once, just like he did, all because of the Avengers. 

This would be sadistic as hell, bc on top of putting half of Earth in permanent grief — the half that eventually realizes that they were “dead” for 5 years and that even though it was random, they feel tremendous guilt for the grief they caused — he’s killing 3.6 billion people who grieved and grieved for 5 years only to miraculously get their loved ones back...and then get massacred/genocided. 

The cherry on top for him? The *Avengers* can’t avenge anything and sure as hell wouldn’t be able to undo it. If they kill a captured Zemo, he wins. If they don’t kill him, he wins. 



___________________________

**Good “villains” never see themselves as the villains or see that the heroes see them as the villains; the best “villains” legitimately see themselves as the actual heroes of the story with their opposition being the villains**. 

Zemo, Killmonger, and Vulture (Adrian Toomes) have been refreshing villains in this sense. 

**Toomes** was a bad man, but he wasn’t a *bad guy* until he realized that Peter was threatening his family’s wealth and homestead and his livelihood. He saw his livelihood as perhaps illegal but not wrongful or unethical, and his livelihood was born out of what he saw as severe hypocrisy and a pseudo-caste system between superheroes and civilians. 

**Killmonger** didn’t want to destroy or rule the world so much as he had multiple motivations with related roots, all of which were created by his upbringing and exacerbated by the murder of his father. 

From his point of view, not once did he see himself as a villain or doing anything villainous; he killed as he needed to, and before the film’s events he killed as he was ordered to. He not only has virtuous traits but shared them with our hero, and he was true to what little Wakandan culture he knew, including the right to royal combat. 

On top of wanting Wakanda to stop hiding in fear of being discovered and having Wakandan-exclusive metals, fabrics, products, inventions, land, etc. get discovered/revealed to/by the rest of the world, at which point the fear would be losing any/some/all of those things. Killmonger instead wanted to proactively take charge and have Wakandans become “colonizers” in the way that Americans and Europeans did so, in a “2 wrongs make a right” sort of way. 

Nonetheless, at the very center, the very core of Killmonger is a boy who was “raised in nothing but hate” (borrowed from MBJ’s Creed 2) and is now a man acting out of that lifelong hate, with a good chance that even if he achieved his goals worldwide he wouldn’t be content or fulfilled.

At the end he comes to realize this upon his last dozen breaths and it’s why it feels more like a Shakespearean or Greek tragedy death than a moment of victory or relief during the film’s climax.",True,False,False,,0,1556835547,,False,0,{},emcvljh,False,t3_bjt8gd,False,True,t1_emb7qan,/r/marvelstudios/comments/bjt8gd/theory_thursday_may_02_2019/emcvljh/,False,,1559499656,2,True,False,marvelstudios,t5_2uii8,r/marvelstudios,public,0,

If you are one those forever alone virgins, its a good time to buy one. It'll make your sex life a whole lot better and longer lasting sex if you ever do a real woman. I don't remember that last time I actually fapped... its been years.

Only $1400, this newer higher brand came out of china . Quite lovely. Even this lovely shares the same type

Ah. You mentioned tipis, which would be fairly specific. I was wondering if you had any personal experience with Plains Indians. 

&gt;I value joy, but not when it comes at the expense of others, like Muslims feeling joy throwing gays off buildings or Mexican drug lords feeling joy when they behead innocent civilians

As I was saying above though,  fMRIs don't show that people are feeling joy when they're being sadistic. The highest levels of joy have been measured when extremely experienced meditators did lovingkindness meditation.  They were so happy the scientists originally thought the machine was broken.  About 500x happier than average. Basically,  science says that developing empathy is the best way to become happy. 

&gt;Of course it's subjective. I thought that was obvious. 

Not if you're going to make claims that one culture is objectively better.  Then admitting it's subjective basically undermines your whole argument. If all you're saying is that cultures are fundamentally equal but you like yours... that's like saying your favorite food is pizza,  but some people like soup and no one is right.  If you're saying a culture is better,  then you need to outline what is better, and why. 

&gt;If living in a hut, hunting wild deer, with no electricity or running water sounds nice to you, then good for you. 

So two things.  First,  it hasn't at all been established that this or worse is not where the European approach to ecology will lead humanity.  It's quite a realistic possibility that you will be living without running water by the end of your life. Your tap water might already be contaminated now, by lead and carcinogenic compounds. If a culture only gives a percentage of people a good quality of life for a couple hundred years and then plunges everyone into catastrophe, I'm not seeing how that's a great approach to things.  

Second,  I once went to see this great Buddhist teacher.  She's British,  actually.  And she had just come out of 12 years literally meditating in a cave by herself. And she talked about how something she noticed coming out and walking in big cities was how unhappy everyone seemed,  despite their material comfort.  She said she was extremely happy in her cave, where she had virtually nothing,  and she talked about how many of the Tibetan people she knew had almost nothing but were much happier than people in London or New York. One might agree that running water is quite nice,  while also understanding that focusing on material luxury might be a bit of a misguided and empty way to judge how much a culture has to offer.  As an analogy,  if someone has focused their life on developing wisdom and kindness,  they might not have washboard abs on their deathbed.  But maybe that's not the measure that a wise person would use to evaluate them. 

This is why I loved anthropology class in college. I always thought it was really interesting to think about the different ways people could do things,  and whether my way was really the best or only way. 

[Here's](https://youtu.be/q0ChZpIBgSo) that teacher I mentioned talking about how she learned to deal with depression through Buddhist practice.  I think the fact that this British person found so much joy and value in an Eastern religion shows that other cultures have extremely valuable things to offer.

What a great question! I’ll try to answer it. 

Capitalist roaders like Gorbachev and Yeltsin (who were probably under American influence), forcefully ended the Soviet Union despite protests to keep it intact. Yeltsin, the first president of Russia, was a drunk nationalist who was more interested in receiving foreign bribes than looking after the well being of the Soviet people. The majority of Russians wanted to keep the USSR and the US actually faked the election results of 1996 to keep Yeltsin in power. So, basically, American sabotage once again.

&gt; The answer is probably that a market economy is a superior way of organizing things compared to a command economy.

Lol. 

Let’s remember that the Soviet Union industrialized a semi feudal area in the world (Eastern Europe) and transformed it into a world power (from poor agrarian economy to launching dogs to orbit in the space of 40 years).

(In their memories) 

S was a boy growing up in pre-war Europe. As he reached his teens, he made a decision that he brought to his father - he wanted to dedicate his life to learning Torah, to move to another town, one with a major yeshiva. His father, however, did not agree and insisted he learn a trade. Ultimately they reached a compromise; S would stay home and learn a trade (plumbing), and his father would learn Torah with him every day. And so it went; S became a highly skilled Jewish plumber, a man with a deep love of Torah. Who could fix the pipes. 

Time passed and the war came. S ended up in a camp, waiting in line to die. Overwhelmed with fear. As he stood in line waiting, a guard came by asking if anyone was a plumber; there was a problem with the commandant's hot water (perhaps his bath, perhaps his still - I've heard it told more than once). S spoke up - ""I'm a plumber"" - and the guard pulled him out of line. And then - out of nowhere - he grabbed M. ""He's my assistant - I can't work without him"". M, of course, knew nothing about plumbing.

Together they fixed the pipes on survived the war, moved to America and went to work. S continued as a plumber and grew a highly successful plumbing business. His first son became a rabbi and Rosh Yeshiva. His second son became a plumber, who loves Torah.

M became a general contractor and built many hundreds of homes that have brought generations of families happiness and joy. And of course, for so many years, S was his plumber.

- Cowboy Bebop (1998) An action space series with animation that holds up amazing well today. It also had one of the best endings in anime in my opinion. Episodic mostly with a few overarching plot lines. One of the more well-regarded anime out there and one of my favorites. There is some pretty good humor as well. It’s basically a space Western if you have seen Firefly it’s somewhat of like that. Also recommend the dub for this one.

- Ghost in the Shell (Film 1995) (SAC 2002) Film is more philosophical taking a look at human consciousness and what it means to be human. SAC is more of a straight up crime drama.

So he and his brother decided to get out of town as soon as they could.

They grabbed what supplies they could as well as an old bike and started making their way away to anywhere safe. During their exodus, they came upon another small town. As they approached, they learned that, like their home, this town too was occupied by the Germans. However, they knew something was wrong here. Though they were still a fair distance away, they heard shouting like something was going down.

People in former GDR federal states still get less money from pensions and get on average paid less and those regions are definitely economically less developed, which lead to the fact that a lot of (young) people move away from there, leading to a significant decrease of the population.

Right-wing populism is far more relevant there than in the west, which often leads to the fact, that especially the federal state of Sachsen is stereotyped as a racist shithole, which holds *some* truth, but I think also is exaggerated, political views simply are more extreme there; far-left wing parties are also more relevant than in the West.

Overall I would say there definitely still are some cultural differences, which are comparable to other former Soviet-occupied or Soviet satellite countries in comparison to Western Europe. There still are a lot of bad feelings and even animosities, from both sides and since this is Germany everyone is super jealous of any kind of money or status others supposedly enjoy but which oneself doesn't. West Germans love to complain about how much money former East Germany gets, even though it's just necessary.

Latrodectus tredecimguttatus, also known as the Mediterranean black widow, or the European black widow, is a species in the genus Latrodectus of the widow spiders. It is commonly found throughout the Mediterranean region, ranging from southern Iberia to southwest and central Asia, hence the name. Specimens from central Asia are also known by the binomial name Latrodectus lugubris; that name, however, is now considered improper, though it is still commonly found in the literature. Latrodectus tredecimguttatus was previously considered a subspecies of Latrodectus mactans.

**Mediterranean recluse spider**

Loxosceles rufescens, the Mediterranean recluse spider, originated in the Mediterranean region as its name implies, but is now found worldwide.Like other species of the genus Loxosceles, bites from the Mediterranean recluse spider can have dangerous effects, causing skin lesions – a condition known as loxoscelism. Despite co-occurrence with humans for millennia, there is only a single report of a human fatality linked to a bite from this species, a case report from 2016 in which no spider was captured for a confirmed identification, and in which the victim suffered from an autoimmune disorder (myasthenia gravis).

Je suis passé par exactement le même épisode dans ma vie. Sans trop entrer dans les détails, durant une période de ma vie, j'étais au chômage et j'ai eu une période dépressive ou je ne pouvais pas sortir. C'était en plus accompagné de crises d'angoisse, chose que je n'avais jamais connu dans ma vie mais qui me terrifiait.
La lumière du jour me faisait mal. Je n'arrivais pas à supporter la foule dans la rue. Je vivais chez moi dans le noir. C'était une période terrbile. Au bout d'un moment j'ai dû recourir au RSA aussi. C'était absolument vital pour moi. Je savais que je devais me sortir de là, je ne savais pas trop comment faire.
Alors j'ai pris rendez vous avec un CMP. Je suis tombé sur une psychologue. Elle m'a dit 2 ou 3 trucs qui m'ont réellement aidé, notamment une phrase qui m'a stupéfait et qui m'a un peu changé. Mais c'était trop insuffisant. Cela ne changeait rien à ma dépression et à mes crises d'angoisse.
J'ai pris un rendez-vous avec un autre CMP. Là, j'ai été reçu par un psychiatre. Je me suis fait prescrire du Xanax.
Globalement j'ai un avis mitigé des CMP. Tout dépend de qui tu rencontres. Mais tu dois y aller. Tu ne te fera pas enfermer.
Le Xanax a fonctionné un peu pour moi, il m'a permis de me détendre et de pouvoir sortir. Je conseillerai le médicament comme un outil momentané, une béquille. Car cette approche à de très gros inconvénients.
D'une, le Xanax m'occasionnait des trous de mémoire. Il me rendait moins concentré, moins apte à réfléchir. C'était comme vivre dans un petit nuage, agréable mais brumeux.
Le second inconvénient est l'addiction. En lisant des témoignages sur le Xanax, j'ai vu des gens incapables de fonctionner sans. Je me souviens de cette femme sous Xanax depuis 11 ans ! Elle en prenait 6 ou plus par jour.
J'ai donc décidé d'arrêter le Xanax. Je l'ai fait pendant peut être 2 ou 3 mois. Je ne voulais pas en dépendre. Je n'ai pas informé mon psychiatre, j'ai juste arrêté.

Ce qui m'a sauvé ce sont 2 techniques en particulier:


1/ La respiration. Je sais ça a l'air con comme ça, tout le monde sait respirer. Cependant il existe des techniques qui permettent de contrôler son rythme cardiaque. La technique de respiration permet de contrôler ses angoisses, elle m'ont aidé à éradiquer mes crises. Il y a des centres qui dispensent ce type de formation, ensuite je faisais un exercice quotidien de respiration d'environ quelques minutes. Et je faisais cet exercice aussi chaque fois que j'en avais besoin, lorsque je sentais une vague de panique arriver.


2/ La gestion de ses pensées négatives. Alors là ce serait trop long à expliquer. Il y a des ouvrages et des sites qui en parlent. Il existe des techniques très simples permettant de refuser, de rejeter les pensées toxiques.

Ces 2 choses m'ont réellement aidé, elles m'ont changé et m'ont permis de sortir du trou.
Quant au RSA, eh bien j'allais aux réunions. Je sais que c'est difficile. Dans ton état, je sais que sortir est un effort terrible. J'y suis passé. J'y allais par simple nécessité de survie. Alors je me filais un coup de pied au cul, j'affrontais la lumière, je devais causer avec les gens là-bas. Ce n'était pas une bonne expérience. Les réunions étaient bidon. C'est de la figuration pour la scène politique, mais dans les faits elles ne servent à rien.

Du coup on a eu :
- Pour ma fille, on a cherché un peu, puis on a trouvé son prénom de manière très naturelle. Je crois que c'était dans un livre de prénoms.

Also may I ask, isn’t it fascinating how the narrative by the Turkish government and their defenders used to be “200,000 Armenians dies in the war due tO was casualties” and now all of a sudden its “800,000 people migrated away” 

Oh and one more thing when the founder of modern day Turkey ottöturk was asked about the Armenian genocide he replied with “there were no Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire therefore there could not have been a genocide”

As I understand it, the sources of Sharia law are not only the Koran and the Sunna, but also the Hadith. I believe that Mohammad said precious little about homosexuality per se in the Koran and Sunna, and most of the attitudes about homosexuality grew about historially and organically through the Hadith, which are interpretations and legalistic analyses of more origin sources.

I forget where I read about it, but an important part of intolerance for LGBQ issues in the Muslim world was brought about through colonial influence from British and other European powers. For example, [this article](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/08/african-homosexuality-colonial-import-myth) describes the situation in Africa:

&gt;The Portuguese were among the first Europeans to explore the continent. They noted the range of gender relations in African societies and referred to the ""unnatural damnation"" of male-to-male sex in Congo. Andrew Battell, an English traveller in the 1590s, wrote this of the Imbangala of Angola: ""They are beastly in their living, for they have men in women's apparel, whom they keep among their wives.""

If and when polygamy is practiced in the West, it typically occurs in largely rural areas rather than urban areas. The situation is probably the same among Muslims. My understanding is that polygamy is also relatively rare in the Muslim world, probably because of the prohibitive cost and the requirement to treat each and every spouse equitably. 

Perhaps divorce is more common, with the somewhat Westerly acceptable mentality of ""trading out the old model for a new one."" Islamic marriage does try to make this prohibitive as well, given that ""prenups"" and ""postnups"" (""mukkadama"" and ""muakharra"") are required in all marriage contracts (""katab kitab"").",True,False,False,,0,1556868861,,False,0,{},eme3d6g,False,t3_bjwzqg,False,True,t1_emdyi8k,/r/RightwingLGBT/comments/bjwzqg/not_christianity_not_judaism_but_islam/eme3d6g/,False,,1561455831,1,True,False,RightwingLGBT,t5_3dc8i,r/RightwingLGBT,public,0,

[],Bionic_Otter,1545265826.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_2l2v648y,False,"I never found the original study but I can agree with you that what I presume was the follow-up to it left a lot to be desired. But it looks like the number it arrived at isn't too far off. As per Lehman's comment above, it works out to be about 28%, that is, the US spends 28% as much on defending the oil supply as it does on the oil itself.  


Regarding the use of global vs domestic consumption in the math, it really depends how you interpret the phrase ""a 30% subsidy"". If it's taken to mean that the US spends 30% as much on defending the oil supply as ***the US*** itself does on oil itself, it seems to be about right. If it's taken to mean that the US spends 30% as much on defending the oil supply as ***the entire world*** spends on oil, then of course it's way off. But the context in Chomsky's book made it clear he was talking about domestic consumption. The context in the book is:

&gt;A large part of the Pentagon budget is devoted to keeping Middle East oil prices in a range that the United States and its energy companies consider appropriate. I know of only one technical study of the topic: it concludes that Pentagon expenditures amount to a 30% subsidy to the market price of oil

Note he doesn't say it's the whole Pentagon budget, only ""a large part"" of it, and he's talking about domestic oil usage. So I never assumed he was talking about the global oil supply, and I don't think he intended to be deceptive, though since you only saw the bit I cut and pasted in here when looking for the source you might have been given that impression unintentionally.  


&gt; We would be spending lots of that money anyway even if there was no oil. 

How much is ""lots"" of that money? From the source earlier, it sounds like a pretty decent amount is for oil security:

&gt;*Q:  If the Middle East did not have oil, would the U.S. be spending its  blood and treasure to stay so deeply involved in the region?*  
&gt;  
&gt;Admiral  Blair: From the military’s point of view, there are three areas we have  to worry about: East Asia, the Middle East, and to a lesser extent, the  Atlantic Russia-Europe region. If the Middle East didn’t have oil, it  wouldn’t be one of the top three priorities. The U.S. would not need to  be so deeply involved.  
&gt;  
&gt;General  Wald: We are not in the Persian Gulf because we are benevolent. We want  oil to flow out of there. If the region were stable, without threats to  close the Strait of Hormuz or threats to Aramco facilities, we would  not be there.

...

&gt; I mean how do you explain the inclusion of coal in that study for Christ sake? 

To be honest I have no idea why the author included it in what I took to be the follow up study - it seemed silly as soon as I saw it. That said he only had it in one scenario (he discussed a few) to make the estimate conservative (e.g. what if the subsidy wasn't entirely for oil, but just for fossil fuels in general, then of course the % figure comes out smaller). But it's one scenario in one paper, and even if it is silly that doesn't do anything to contradict the various Generals etc. quoted above confirming that a significant fraction of the military budget is for security of the oil supply. And neither have you.  


How do you explain this question and answer? Is Lehman correct? Or lying? Or just plain mistaken?

&gt; *Q: The  literature review undertaken by SAFE produced an average of $81 billion,  or approximately 16 to 20 percent of the base defense budget per annum,  for the cost of protecting the global oil supply. Do you think that  number is too high, too low or about right? Do you think the OCO funding  should be included in oil defense costs?*  
&gt;  
&gt;Secretary  John Lehman: The 20 percent figure is a credible number. Since the end  of Cold War, the only real threats we have are threats to the oil  supply. People have only begun to worry about Russia and China in the  last 10 years. I would make the case that the OCO spending is related to  oil protection.

That alone could classify it as a nightmare. While he and the old man were not very close, he was extremely relieved to know dad was still alive. And Ansel...[Parcival](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/553043862659006466/573909716288405531/smug_parci.jpg) had no idea how to live without his older brother.

""Hello, Parci?""

""....Yep. It's me.""

""You never call this early, is that something wrong?""

""No, man. I-uh, I want to check up on you, man. Are you alright!""

""Well, my final project is sucking the life out of me. Nothing new, really. Don't worry, I'll be alright. You?""

"".....""

""Parci? Parcival.""

""Like I said, just checking in. Talk to you later, man. Love you.""

""....Love you too, bro."" *Click*

However, he also had a faint vision of happiness. That he was a proud man, someone who was beloved. He was in a world of adventure where a person could soar high in the wind with nothing but dreams and ambition. He also remembered *someone*. Her image was a blurry shade of lively red and her touch was magical. The smell of rose...

""Master Parcival."" Then he remembered he was on the way on school, resting his arm near the car door as the classical music soothingly playing. Today forecast was quite pleasant: clear sky with the temperature rising. ""We've arrived."" Since his family had moved their business empire to Japan, Dad had been making sure his sons would become fluent in Japanese as quickly as possible. Instructing his butler to communicate with Parcival in exclusively Japanese outside the house was another his 'policy'. It did help him cross the language barrier and discovered that Alphonse was able to speak Japanese in a British accent.

""Already?"" The golden-haired boy diverted his azure gaze away from the bulletproof glass. His butler had already opened the door for him. A classically handsome man in his early 30s. with dark hair. Parcival could tell several eyes were gawking at his car: a slick black European luxury marvel of an automobile.

""Would you like me to carry your backpack, sir?""

*And embarrassing myself on the way to my class*? ""No, thank you."" The golden boy waved his hand dismissively, partly because he didn't want the butler to sniff around the pockets and found what he intended to smuggle inside the school. ""Just drive safe. I'll be fine.""

The butler bowed. For a posh British butler, Alphonse nailed the Japanese bow even better than some of the native. ""Thank you for your concern, sir. I would have to make sure you'll be alright.""

""Look, I know you are doing your job. If Maroni and his brothers could barely bust my head on my old school, I doubt these Asian thugs can lay a finger on me."" *Stop smiling, damn you.* ""You are my butler, not my babysitter. I'll stay out of trouble, alright?""

Alphonse had been with his family long enough to know when to take Parcival seriously. ""Have a good one, Master Parcival."" He stepped away so Parcival could get a good look at the school's gate and who were waiting for him. ""Don't forget to greet your admirers, sir."" *Of course, I won't.*

""Don't forget to buy more hair gel, Alphonse."" The golden boy walked through the gate, waving at his butler nonchalantly without turning back. ""Try not to make my dad's house too quiet."" Parcival knew Alphonse would stand there, watching until Parcival reached the edge of his sight, and nothing he said could convince the butler to halt his watchful eyes. *Suit yourself.*

Of course, other students were gossiping as he was entering the school.

""Even his butler is hot! See?!""

""That's him! That's the new boy I told you. Dreamy, isn't he? I could look into those blue eyes all night...If you know what I mean...""

""Aw, this place is just getting better and better.""

""Hotter, you mean.""

""That's the Goldilocks I told you. Smug cocky foreigner, from what I've heard."" A group of boys didn't even notice him when Parcival was close enough to listen. ""His dad is some of those titans. Old noble family and all. Heard he got kicked out from his old fancy rich kids school. Don't know why, though. I bet a millionaire's kid like him could---""

""It's billionaire, actually."" The golden boy's Japanese was flawless, so was his smirk. ""Sorry, but millionaires are so last year."" Ignoring the gossip boys, Parcival looked over their heads thanks to his height to something more interesting. The signature smirk never left the golden boy's face, and then he winked. ""Hi, ladies. Would you like me to walk you to the class?""

""**PARCI-KUN!**"" *Killed it.*

&gt; Some 35%, said the policy change to push for a new Brexit vote made them feel more favourably towards Labour, while 14% said it made them feel less so.

&gt; The survey of 5,000 voters across the North, Yorkshire and Humber and the Midlands found that 76% would support staying in the EU, with 24% against.

&gt; If it was a choice between Remain and backing Prime Minister Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement, the split would be 81% to 19% in favour of staying in the EU, according to the survey.

But that system definitely shouldn't be a single referendum. Why? Take for example Catalonia. Some years ago, the separatists were a minority, like 20% or so. Then, after the economic crisis, when its bordering on 50% (a couple over or under depending on the year or poll), they want to make a referendum. If the separatism goes down again you can bet separatists won't ask for a referendum again.

But a referendum is a one-way door. While the separatists don't win, they could continue asking for referendums but once they've won, there won't be more.

Spain, Catalonia included (which wasn't a separate Kingdom but was part of the Crown of Aragon), have been existing in its current form for more than 500 years. This is more than twice the time the USA has existed, for example. It would be incredibly stupid to break it for a single referendum whose result would depend on the particular whim of the population at a particular point in time.

So, considering this, a better system would be to have several referendums over a long time. For example, every 10 years. If the ""yes, separate"" wins on three referendums in a row (over a period of 30 years) you can be really sure that the desire is real, multi-generational, and not a fluke and then the independence should be automatically granted.

Outside of these ""political engineering"" considerations, there are several things I don't like about the particular case of the Catalonian independence movement, like the xenophobia and supremacism that permeates it.

Your immediate deflection away from the topic at hand and telling me to contribute to Wikipedia is a red flag for your inherent insecurity within your argument.

In Gregtech machines have both an amp and a voltage requirement. Voltage is the actual amount of energy they use so for example 32 eu/t while amperage is kind of just a static requirement.

So for example a 1 amp 32 eu/t recipe uses 32 eu/t and can be run by 1 32 eu/t generator there are recipes that require 2 amps but they are rare because most non multiblock machines can only accept 1 amp.

So far this is similar to FE. And as you mentioned you can use battery buffers to highten the amperage of a generator so for example if you feed a 32 eu/t geneator into a 4x battery buffer you can draw 4 amps at 32 eu/t and technically power 4 machines but only IF the total requirement of power does not exceed 32 eu/t.

So for example its fine to run 4 machines with a recipe that each uses 8 eu/t (maybe you have to take cable loss into consideration here) but its not possible to run even 2 machines with 24 eu/t recipes even if you have the amperage.

The easiest way to calculate this for each processing chain is to look at every recipe you want to use, add the eu/t and divide by your voltage leve, thats how many generator you need. Then feed them all into a battery buffer and put as many batteries in as you want amperage/machines in you line, finally connect everything with appropiate cables (again consider cable loss for your eu/t calculation)

I think the naming in the mod is a bit confusing because in real life current or amperage is the actual amount of energy while voltage is the energy level. In Gregtech though voltage is an energy amount per tick and amperage is just ...

Não, não devia. Uma pessoa da cidade do Porto é portuense. Não existe uma identidade própria e demarcada entre as pessoas de uma determinada freguesia. Uma pessoa do Bonfim (como eu) não tem grandes diferenças de uma pessoa de Campanhã ou de Santo Ildefonso. Todas essas pessoas se sentem portuenses, têm orgulho na sua cidade e, por isso, apoiam um clube que representa a sua cidade e o orgulho que têm nela.

A minha lógica aplica-se ao local de onde uma pessoa é e que, de certo modo, a representa. Normalmente é a cidade onde mora ou nasceu, mas pode também ser o país ou a freguesia (se tiver uma identidade própria, sei lá). É por isso que apoio a seleção portuguesa e não a brasileira, p.e..

&gt; Não podes inventar uma regra e depois começar a meter excepções quando percebes que estavas a ser hipócrita.

Não estou a inventar regra nenhuma. Estou a dizer que **para mim** não faz sentido uma pessoa apoiar um clube que não o represente minimamente. Aconselho-te a ires visitar Guimarães, que tem uma grande percentagem de adeptos Vitorianos e, certamente, não é por causa do número de títulos conquistados.

O que está a fazer confusão é o facto do Porto ter mais adeptos do que o Boavista ou o Salgueiros. É normal que assim o seja pela grandeza do clube (ligada, entre outras coisas, aos títulos claro). No entanto, para mim essa grandeza não se sobrepõe ao caráter local do clube que falei acima.

Edit: E não é uma questão de distância mas sim de representatividade. Por exemplo, quem é português, apoia a seleção portuguesa, mesmo que more a uma grande distância.

[],manojlds,1211472774.0,,Ferrari,[],,Ferrari,dark,text,t2_35gqu,False,"&gt;The team of the Prancing Horse tries to react to the four one-two wins of Mercedes in the start of the 2019 championship and decides on a package of technical innovations that should allow to better balance the Red, already sending the tires in temperature in the warm up.  
&gt;  
&gt;Which Ferrari will we see in Barcelona? Don't expect a dominant SF90, remembering the winter tests.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The single-seaters have evolved a lot in the first four seasonal GPs so it would not be correct to refer to the indications of the two collective Catalan sessions in which the Red was playing them to a Mercedes who had preferred to hide.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Spain starts the European season. Barcelona represents a sort of restart of the Championship because who will bring so much and who will bring so little technical innovation in an attempt to make a leap in quality and change the order of values in the field.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;It is clear that you expect the reaction of the Red after the four one-two wins in a row of silver arrows. It's up to Maranello to take a step forward to try to put the W10s in crisis, but the feeling is that Mercedes can still give a margin to keep the SF90s driven by Sebastian Vettel and Charles Leclerc in check without having to resort to striking news.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;New wings, both front and rear, have been deliberated on Ferrari. The objective was to increase the aerodynamic load in order to look for a good balance that would allow the Red to transfer the necessary energy to the tyres, especially in the delicate warm up phase, where the SF90 did not excel at all.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;If the rear wing seen in Azerbaijan represented an adaptation of the aerodynamics to the characteristics of the track with a lower configuration to favour the maximum speeds on the long straight of 2.2 km, at Montmelò we will find solutions that will aim at an increase of the downforce without penalizing too much the efficiency, with an incidence of the flaps that could cost in terms of resistance to advancement.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The team from Maranello, therefore, is looking for a solution to its problems: especially with the Soft compound tyres, the SF90 struggles to have a constant behaviour and a competitive pace, while it defends itself better with the Medium tyres, reversing the indications of the most recent past.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The action of the new front wing will also be combined with the greater flow of air that will be blown from the slot in the front rim: the intention is to move away from the wheel the swirls that will come from the new flaps so that they can be useful to clean the wake of the rubber in front of the harmful turbulence.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The capacity of the brake duct, therefore, will be increased to serve the aerodynamic function, rather than that of cooling the brakes. The front wing will be able to produce more vertical thrust without renouncing to the concept of the outwash that is teaching in the paddock.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;It is probable that the changes concern the curl of the main profile and the inner part of the flaps with the clear intention of increasing the capacity of the Y250 vortex which is then influenced by the complex bargeboards.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Ferrari was also planning to decide on engine 2 for Spain, but the team is more likely to postpone the replacement of the unit that started the season, preferring to continue the endurance tests on the bench.

Modulating vasopressin in ASD

The neuropeptide vasopressin has been implicated in the regulation of social behaviors in animals and humans. The VANILLA clinical trial evaluated balovaptan, an oral selective vasopressin V1a receptor antagonist, in 223 men with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This 12-week phase 2 trial showed no improvement on the primary endpoint (SRS-2 score) but did show improvement on the secondary outcome measure of adaptive behaviors assessed by the Vineland-II scale (Bolognani et al.). In a related clinical study involving a 4-week intranasal administration of vasopressin to children with ASD, improvements were observed on the SRS-2 primary outcome measure (Parker et al.). Both drugs were well tolerated and had an acceptable safety profile, suggesting that modulating the vasopressin pathway may be a useful therapeutic strategy for ASD.

Abstract

The social impairments of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have a major impact on quality of life, yet there are no medications that effectively treat these core social behavior deficits. Preclinical research suggests that arginine vasopressin (AVP), a neuropeptide involved in promoting mammalian social behaviors, may be a possible treatment for ASD. Using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel study design, we tested the efficacy and tolerability of a 4-week intranasal AVP daily treatment in 30 children with ASD. AVP-treated participants aged 6 to 9.5 years received the maximum daily target dose of 24 International Units (IU); participants aged 9.6 to 12.9 years received the maximum daily target dose of 32 IU. Intranasal AVP treatment compared to placebo enhanced social abilities as assessed by change from baseline in this phase 2 trial’s primary outcome measure, the Social Responsiveness Scale, 2nd Edition total score (SRS-2 T score; F1,20 = 9.853; P = 0.0052; ηp2 = 33.0%; Cohen’s d = 1.40). AVP treatment also diminished anxiety symptoms and some repetitive behaviors. Most of these findings were more pronounced when we accounted for pretreatment AVP concentrations in blood. AVP was well tolerated with minimal side effects. No AVP-treated participants dropped out of the trial, and there were no differences in the rate of adverse events reported between treatment conditions. Last, no changes from baseline were observed in vital signs, electrocardiogram tracings, height and body weight, or clinical chemistry measurements after 4 weeks of AVP treatment. These preliminary findings suggest that AVP has potential for treating social impairments in children with ASD.",True,False,False,,0,1556882744,,False,0,{},emefet1,False,t3_bk7bi2,False,True,t3_bk7bi2,/r/psychology/comments/bk7bi2/hormone_treatment_may_improve_social_behavior_in/emefet1/,False,,1561461495,1,True,False,psychology,t5_2qhcz,r/psychology,public,0,

1. your ONLY example of "" misogyny"" is an essay from 1972 (that's 49 years ago) and it's a short story about ONE women who fantasied about being raped (a rare thing but it actually DO happen... there are also men who fantasizing about being raped by women...) it's not the best essay but i wouldn't call it misogynistic or see it as the proof bernie is that unless i already have made up my mind that bernie is bad (try to be honest for once in your life and actually think about what bernie has said and done in all his live put that all together and then tell me if you really would say that's misogyny...) and even IF you come out thinking that bernie is misogynistic claiming it's on the same level as trump is just a blatant lie... Hillary clinton said more misogynistic things in the last 2 decades then bernie said his whole life and trump said more in the 5 years then all of the current democratic presidential candidates put together in all of their lives... 
2. he shouldn't have apologized (and actually didn't) about the bro-culture but the part about sexual harassment was bad and he did take action and responsibility... more then most others can claim, but again unless you already dislike bernie and are looking for reasons to validate your believe nobody with a clear mind would think he hates women....
3. thats jut so fcked up! i don't even where to start: here is his quote:  ""Oh my god, there’s a lot of poverty in this world, and you’re going to have people from all over the world. And I don’t think that’s something that we can do at this point. Can’t do it "" reading that as ""hating minorities instead of: we need to lower poverty around the world, is something only true assholes can do! to be clear: I AM for abolishing all BORDERS but not right now... AFTER we made the living conditions relative equal... otherwise the system would simply collapse... 1 the US and the EU simply can't take in a billion people or even 100 million... it is impossible... so open borders at THIS time are not possible... and to say it's even comparable to build the wall and have a gestapo light (aka ICE) running amok is again very veil... 

&gt; Capitalism isn’t perfect by any measure, but it can get close with the right regulations &amp; policy measures 

exactly what bernie want'S... he never advocated for the end of private ownership, he advocates for universal health-care (something EVERY OTHER MODERN NATION HAS), he advocates for breaking up big banks (but not abolishing the banking sector whole) and a lot tougher regulations... he's advocating for public financed collages (again something most western countries have) 

&gt; Countries with strong safety nets but capitalist systems like Germany and Denmark are thriving right now 

compared to the US? sure... but quite frankly there are still poor people around... it still is very important for your success in life how much money your parents make... neither country is far from perfect (that'S why the right is rising i both countries... social inequality gives rise to the ""extreme"" either blame the ""others"" (the EU or immigrants) -&gt; right-wing or you blame the super rich who quite literally steal from their workers -&gt; left-wing...

BTW I am from germany... and while i'm happy that my chances of getting gun down by lunatic with a gun (i believe you call them cops...) is a ot lower, and if i get sick i can go to a doctor without being afraid of getting bankrupted, there are still problems here... but to be totally clear: bernie would be a center-right/center-left politician here in germany (comparable to merkel) and nobody would think he'S a socialist... it's just that in the US everything left from hitler is called socialism...",True,False,False,,0,1556886603,,False,0,{},emek655,False,t3_bk2uim,False,True,t1_emegfgw,/r/neoliberal/comments/bk2uim/true_radical_centrism_has_never_been_tried/emek655/,False,,1561463728,0,True,False,neoliberal,t5_2sfn3,r/neoliberal,public,0,

It seems like a weird claim that European Jews enslaved anybody. Considering the system would have undoubtedly been facilitated and allowed to exist because of the mother countries (Russia, poland, etc.) not because of the Jews. Jews were not writing the laws, they were subject to them.

edit: plus the existence of extra taxes probably exacerbated the system. Where the nobility prospered, and european peasantry got the short end of the stick.

We're talking about the Green Parties policies, which you describe as insane. I'm pointing out that the approach you insist is the only way to conserve animal life is fundamentally failing, so insisting that any other approach is insane is ridiculous.

I don't think you actually know why gm crops were banned by the EU. You've just swallowed the 'people against these corporations are just looney lefty greens' line that is formulated to make you feel smart without having to look into the matter. Do you believe everything you're told about why the EU has made decisions? If you do, then I guess you're a staunch Leaver. You wouldn't stand for straight bananas, and everything else you've been told they get up. Like banning gm crops because of the reasons the corporations selling them tell you.

&gt; It is insane because it's an incredibly short sighted ignorant view of the way in which zoos function.

Again, not insane.  An incredibly short-sighted view, if it is that, is not insane. Grow up. A view that disagrees with your approach is not insane. Especially when you take one part and ignore the fact that it would be part of wider policies.

For example, if you said that it is insane to think of removing all safe pedestrian crossing points from a city centre, while ignoring a wider policy of banning cars from that city centre that would make pedestrian crossing areas unnecessary, you would be too short-sighted in your easy outrage.

&gt; Please give me a plan where zoos can be closed without causing harm to conservation.

One where the conservation and restoration of habitat is prioritised over commercial interest. I mean, you obviously don't think that's possible, but considering the alternative is the well-documented rapid and increasing destruction of the vast majority of animal life on the planet, perhaps you might think that there are different ways to approach the problem, and that having zoos isn't the great panacea you seem too think it is.

In a political environment where the global environment is paramount, there would be no need for zoos to raise funding for conservation and conservation research, because the government would prioritise that.

And as for applying that across the world, it's enough to apply it to Western countries and their citizens and corporations actions around the world. Start with that, and we'd see a lot more success in conservation.

So, there is a different way to approach the issue, and while you might disagree with it, it's not insane, and it's one which people are increasingly realising is actually what needs to be done.

2. With historical context these foreigners usually **chose** to sell themselves into slavery due to poverty, or were previously owned by foreigners.

3. The meaning of Leviticus is the “The law unto the priests and Levites”. The Levites where the tribe of Jews set aside to be priests alongside Aaron’s sons. Last time I checked Southern slave owners weren’t priests or Levites. Some more New Testament context leads to Jesus being the final priest who bestowed upon a new convenient in which God’s Holy Spirit was sent to dwell in every person. The priestdom is no more, because we no longer need priest to have an agent-like relationship between the people and God’s Spirit. Therefor Leviticus isn’t the law for Christians.

Gaining citizenship here depends on your background. If one of your parents is Dutch you can apply for it. After five continuous years of living here you can also apply for the citizenship. 
However living here as a foreigner also depends on your background in general it's easier for Europeans and Westerners (or so I believe). Here are some cases how you can live here as a foreigner: 
- If your partner is Dutch and you can prove you have a steady and legit relationship you're allowed to move here. 
- If you studied here as a foreigner and you find a job here you're also allowed to stay. 
- If you work at a company which is allowed to give you a working visa.

Porque, na minha opinião, o Cristóvão foi e continua sendo disparado o pior técnico que eu vi passar no Flamengo. Então, peço desculpas se de alguma forma te ofendi com o meu comentário anterior.

&gt;Você mesmo acabou com a sua argumentação. ""Alan Patrick pelo Luiz Antônio"".

Na verdade, eu não acabei. Eu não sei se você chegou a ver esse jogo ou se lembra dele, mas o erro dessa substituição não tem a ver com o elenco que ele tinha nas mãos e sim com a sua péssima leitura de jogo. O primeiro tempo acabou com o Flamengo abafando a Ponte no campo de defesa, estávamos naquele estágio ""questão de tempo até sair o gol"" e o Alan Patrick era um dos principais responsáveis por isso (ou o principal). A substituição matou o nosso meio de campo porque não só a Alan Patrick estava bem no jogo como o Luiz Antônio entrou mal e isso fez a ponte começar a crescer até que fizeram o gol. Eu lembro que durante a transmissão foi questionado se o Alan Patrick tinha sentido alguma coisa, pois era a única explicação lógica para aquela substituição, mas logo o reporter de campo confirmou que foi opção tática do treinador. Aí vem a questão: Que raio de treinador muda tão radicalmente na virada do primeiro tempo para o segundo um time que está jogando fora de casa e melhor do que o adversário? E essa foi apenas uma das gafes que ele cometeu.

&gt;Olha o material humano que o Cristovão tinha, e olha a seleção que o Abel tem.

Concordo que a diferença entre os elencos é bem grande e isso deve entrar na conta, mas acho que levar em consideração só isso para avaliar os trabalhos é simplificar demais o problema. Tem muitos fatores aí, por exemplo a paciência da torcida que é inversamente proporcional à qualidade do elenco.

[],RDKBBALL,1515504130.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_rcd6uaa,False,"How to make PUBG better?
I'll talk about general content and optimization changes.

1. Give us exactly the same loot as we have on Erangel, to Miramar and Vikendi.

2. Decrease SR spawn.
My squad leaves hotdrop locations with 2-3 SRs and sometimes we fight with a second squad that's also equipped with SRs.
DMR spawn rate is fine, I think.
It's no longer necessary to use M16 as a budget DMR for the whole game.
3. It's just my opinion, but maths shows clearly that Mutant and M16 are the worst guns in the game now. 
Give them some love!

4. Reduce SMG spawn rate on Vikendi.
Give us exactly the same as you did to Erangel.
5. If you add new maps, I think It'd be great idea to not make general differences in loot. I do not really like opinions like - 'This is msg map  ; This is CQ map ; This is only AR map'. 
6. Skins should NOT BE that expensive.
Halloween event, current streamer skins = Overpriced.

Also, I think that making skins which take few slots is bad.
I mean... I do not like skins like current Korean League ones(Jacket that also contains shirt that can not be changed). Say no to multi slot skins!

7. Take care of optimization.
Game works MUCH better in compare to what we've had last year, but there are still crashes, freezes and FPS stuttering. I play new games, but PUBG is the really first game in which I lose from 150fps to 100 during 0.5 sec and then It increases to 120-130, drop to 100, then again 150 for about few seconds and 120. 

Also, right after landing the game tends to crash or freeze for a moment.
Furnitures are not rendered, the same with shadows inside. 

X patch is free of problems like this, but the next one makes problems totally come back.
It's also weird 'cause In X problems I have Y problems, but after you release next one, my problems dissapear, but my friend starts seeing them. 

8. Take care of servers.
Every patch/hotfix servers work totally different.

Sometimes desync comes back, but I do suffer it 1/20 games I play, so it's still an amazing score In compare to what we used  to have.

Take care of this problem(server sees totally different things) VIDEO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK54fLggg6Y

9. About general content - I really like it and I think it should go the same way as it goes.
BUT remember one thing - NEVER EVER give us level3 helmet as a 'global loot'. This item should ALWAYS be high risk/high reward item that can ONLY be found inside the airdrops.

10.   Rework shotguns.
11.  Rework pistols. They have 0 impact at late game and in current situation with loot - They also have no place in early game in which we found AKM/M4/M16/SMGs.
12. Add Desert Eagle. This weapon has to be powerful, high risk/high reward!
13. Circle Changes to maps that need it.
14. Improve servers. More tick rates/frametimes, better for us. We're gonna really appreciate it.
15. Add competetive/tournament FPP mode. We have been asking for that since last year! It's really amazing adventure.
16. There should be a difference between TPP and FPP. We talked about it with Hawkinz few months ago. He agreed that TPP should be called 'Old PUBG' and FPP 'Competetive' or something like this. 
17. Optimize Vikendi, this map really needs some love.
Map is really good, but most people avoid it 'cause of the loot and general optimization.

18. GIVE US NIGHTMODE TO EVERY SINGLE MAP!
I consider Vikendi as a playable map,  but only on nightmode. 
Old version is too bright to my eyes :( Too white
19.  Take care of LaserSights. I think addon is good, but has no place in current PUBG.
20. Completely delete the 'Utility Belt'. 
Our characters look so bad 'cause of this unnecessary addon.
Change the name into 'Grenadier belt' or something with 'Grenade', make it world spawn and make it allow us to carry few grenades.

Current grenade meta is terrible and so toxic.
Low risk, low skill, high reward.

The basic ammount of grenades should be - 2 smokes, 1 frag, you want more? Use special belt.

21. Language choice/Prefere language.
Option that allows us to play with the same language speakers in randomQ.

22. Give more content to maps which have tooo many empty places.
I think that we need more characteristic instead of 'few the same looking buildings as everywhere'. Locations like the big sawmill in Erangel have to be named or like a big abandoned power plant close to Mylta Power. Give us specific locations, not few the same looking buildings. It'd be a great change! Places that we can recognize with closed eyes, that we can remember about and have our great plays in mind!

23. Take care of AntiCheats.
Current situation with cheaters is terrible.
You should ban 80% players of top100 in EU TPP and at least 40-60% in EU FPP.
I do not know how cheaters like those can be still playing this game...

Also, anticheats totally reduce performance.
Think about making 1 good instead of few that really consume our FPSes and general performance.

24. Take care of ranking system.
Current one = grind, grind, grind, grind = get rewards

25. Vehicle physics.
Posts with videos that community has given you during last 2 weeks explains everything.

26. If you want to add new season pass, keep it the way as current one.
The current one is one of the best season passes I have tested! 
Missions are good, comfortable and enjoyable. It requires just playing to get lvl and that's the way It should work like! BUT I totally hate the fact that every week we get new quests...
Keep it the way as Vikendi/Sanhok passes had. If you do not spent at least 12h every week in PUBG, buying season pass is a bad idea. It should be 'playable' for everybody and give us a chance to catch up.

27. Update UE to latest version.
Current one was not made to carry 100 people in server, only 64.
100ppl gives us good, a bit more dynamic gameplay, but everything has its price.

I think that's it...
This is just my personal opinion and ideas.
This is what I'd like to see in near future as an improvement.

The game in current state is slightly getting better and I'm proud of this :)

The author of the article viewing the current situation without the context of history and blaming ""doing nothing"" on conservatives and libertarians by not creating right wing content and platform.

Initially the platforms currently controlled by the left were supposed to be inclusive where everyone had a voice, hence why there was no real need for competing platforms.

We've been using these platforms so long they've became part of the virtual presence of every modern day individual. 

Sure, having options is nice, but even if I've had an Oscar worthy content and actors and founding, I could upload it to the alternative platforms and it'd still achieve nothing. It'd be probably downloaded by someone and uploaded it to YouTube.

The problem isn't in the creation but in that people on the center and right actually believed in the concept of everyone having a voice on the most known platforms and so in the name of free speech allowed the left to grow because everyone means **everyone**, even people we disagree with.

The fault in the center and right is only having the belief in people listening to reason and common sense,along with trying to get everyone on even footing and noticing too late that everyone else is working on removing center and right from the conversation.

I'm not well versed in sociology, but I'm sure the answer to a leftist echo chamber is not in the creation of an echo chamber of our own.

That'll only breed more separation, animosity and hostility toward each other instead of a conversation.

The question is only if the right should just let the left get so bad that even the most woke people would notice that maybe the blind following of left isn't going to make things better, or the right should aggressively pushing back against the takeover of these platforms?

Honestly at this point the raise of right wing politicians seem to be a natural event that works like a kind of immune reaction to an infection.

There is a reason why Trump got elected and why nationalist leaders in the EU getting popular.

“Lobar transplantation from living donors who are blood group and human leukocyte antigens (HLA)-donor specific antibody (DSA) compatible with the recipient has been performed for selected patients. In general, living lobar transplantation should be reserved for suitable candidates who, because of their clinical status, urgently need transplantation and, because of their place on the waiting list, seem unlikely to survive until a cadaveric donor becomes available. Nevertheless, this practice is rare in North America and Europe and is mostly used in Japan where there is a critical scarcity of cadaveric donors.

The ethical issues surrounding transplantation from living donors have been reviewed, but the debate continues. Nonetheless, recipient outcomes have been satisfactory and donor morbidity has been minimal. In a series of 369 live donors, 18 percent experienced a serious complication, 6 percent needed early rehospitalization, and 2 percent underwent reoperation. While objective measures of lung function suggest low donor morbidity, two subjective complaints were common in a series of 15 lobar donors: a decrease in exercise tolerance and insufficient acknowledgement of the donation.” - UpToDate

Since the emergence of fascism in Europe in the first half of the 20th century, the term ""fascist"" has frequently been used as a pejorative epithet against a wide range of individuals, political movements, governments, public and private institutions, including those that would not usually be classified as fascist in mainstream political science. It usually serves as an emotionally loaded substitute for authoritarian.As early as 1944, British writer George Orwell commented that following its widespread use in the European press ""the word 'Fascism' is almost entirely meaningless"" due to its non-specific use detached from its original political associations.

***

**Neo-fascism**

Neo-fascism is a post–World War II ideology that includes significant elements of fascism. Neo-fascism usually includes ultranationalism, racial supremacy, populism, authoritarianism, nativism and opposition to immigration, as well as  opposition to liberal democracy, parliamentarianism, capitalism, Marxism, communism and socialism. Allegations that a group is neo-fascist may be hotly contested, especially if the term is used as a political epithet. Some post–World War II regimes have been described as neo-fascist due to their authoritarian nature, and sometimes due to their fascination with and sympathy towards fascist ideology and rituals.

The A-Bomb u mention are a weapon that is useable, however dont confuse the presence of A bombs then with the massive amounts we have today. It took quite the effort to build both of those that went to use in japan. The bombing of the industry would present quite the problem though. A lot of the industry the SU had was relocated to the Urals and beyond. You could make the argument that one could launch bombers from the raj due to its proximity, but the again we are still dealing in distances that are huge at best, even if it doesnt look like it on the map the scale of asia is on another level. Bombing germany worked out cause it was less than 1k km from britain away.

The thing is though taht at the ebd of the war in 45 russia not only had a massive industry, but also a lot of reserves and stockpiles of equipment that could replace the casualties the use of an A bomb would inflict.

It is safe to assume that that SU had around 6+million troops in europa at the time with countless of tanks and aircraft (which just in its quantity overpowers american and british airpresence in europe (could be debatable tho)). 

Also i wouldnt hold it for a fact that this many nations would join against SU. At the end of the war patriotism and unity in the SU was at an all time high. The european satelites could try to oppose SU (this would beg the question of how that would look like since they did receive any equipment from SU for quite some time, a man without a weapon can only do so much, bit i am going of a atngent here) but the presence of men already in deployment could probably prevent them from doing that without a great effort.

If you'd like the video to be kept exclusive for your eyes only + $100.

I am in PST and work from 12:30pm to 9:30pm. I am available while at work for chatting, pictures, and even sessions but keep in mind I may be called away.

###Name your Price!

You name it, and I'll come up with a plan that will suit your needs ;)   

###Authentic Girlfriend Experience  
**One day $75**  
**Three days $135**  
**One week $200**  
Get good morning and good night texts, chatting and pictures throughout the day (I love showing off 😋) and sexting when we are both in the mood. 💋
My GFE's progress organically and I don't like to put limits on how many pictures or chat you're getting or a timeframe in which we can sext, however, let you know when I'm too busy to take requests or when I'm not in the mood. You're going to be chatting with me, and I will be myself and honest in every way.

###All Media GFE   
**$135**  
1 week (7 days) with lots of videos and pictures that can be sfw and nsfw. Includes 1 Kik for Later session each day with 10 pics and 10 videos where I get off. 😘
I don't chat/text at all during the time, just send pics and vids. Although I do take requests!

###Motivational GFE  
**Varies**  
Comes with everything the normal GFE does, but with a motivational twist! I recently fell in love with working out and have lost a lot of weight! Now I want to help you loose weight by being your cheerleader and giving you lots of encouragement, or if you need a harsher hand, I can set goals and punish you if you don't meet them. 

###Fetish/Roleplay GFE  
**Varies**  
I love roleplaying and I am super kinky. PM me your request and we'll discuss what I can do for you! 😊

Maar even serieus: de situatie in venezuela is zeer schrijnend en natuurlijk niet goed, er zijn tal van problemen daar die moeten worden getackled. 

Echter herkennen we dat het zogenaamde economische mismanagement van maduro helaas niet de enige oorzaak is voor het leed. Amerikaanse en europese sancties, zoals een verbod op de olieimport en de overname van 1,2 miljard aan venezolaanse goudvoorraad zou enorm schadelijk zijn voot de doorgaande oliestaat in de golf, al helemaal venezuela die meer op de VS ingericht is.

Zo zie je dan ook dat de venezuelaanse oppositie helemaal geen slagkracht heeft zonder deze sabotage en actieve steun. Zelfs hulpmiddelen die amerika zogenaamd wil sturen zijn heel politiek gericht op bepaalde pro-oppositie regios en nog erger, zouden mogelijk wapens kunnen bevatten.

Verder moet je niet ver terug kijken in de geschiedenis om te zien hoe venezuela door amerika al decennialang is getarget. Jn 2002 vond nog een pro-amerikaanse coup plaats (ook gesteund door de amerikanen zelf), alleen faalde deze.

&gt;What exactly is it you're hoping to achieve here?

In this specific case I was just trying to get a reaction by presenting a reasonable counter position. Obviously I'm not expecting to change the mind of the type of person who spends their time making pictures like this, however (admittedly) high quality they might be.

In general, I'm extremely worried about this trend of dismissing anyone and everyone who has something contentious to say as extreme-right, racist and fascist. There ARE actual people like that out there, but by throwing people who *aren't* into that category, you muddy the waters when normal people try to recognise those people with genuinely disgusting ideas. It becomes a ""group of people the left hates"" rather than a group we should *all* hate. It's not a good idea. 

I'll give you an example: a lot of people would probably view Tommy Robinson and Nick Griffin as basically the same. They're not. Nick Griffin has called for racial segregation and the removal of rights from gay people, among other things I'm sure. Tommy Robinson is a populist with a track record of being a thug and is riding a wave of backlash against the problem that fundamental Islam is posing to Europe. Those are NOT the same people. Tommy Robinson is posing the same questions that Douglas Murray and Sam Harris do towards Islam, he's just doing it with about 40 fewer IQ points.

&gt;There are far more reputable people I can look to if I want to learn about the problems Islam has with extremism

Absolutely agreed, as I pointed out above.

&gt;without tarring every single Muslim with the same brush

I don't think he does. This is exactly where I think people get him wrong, and it's why plenty of moderate Muslims are willing to talk to him in the first place. Is he tactful or eloquent in what he says? Absolutely not, but I don't think that alone makes him guilty of being a racist.

&gt;without drawing in the adulation of people who can often be found in comment sections spewing abhorrent bile about anyone who isn't White British.

Unfortunately you don't get to choose who your followers are. Hence why I'm really not a fan of his - his demeanour attracts some absolute fuckwits in a way that someone like Douglas Murray doesn't, simply because their brain hurts when he uses long sentences.

And that sort of brings me on to my final point: if people ignored him, he'd be a nobody. Seriously. He's *not* a smart guy, he's got nothing ground-breaking to say, yet the media and the left shout about him from the rooftops like he's the second coming of Hitler. He's been banned from social media, arrested, etc etc. They've given him *far* more publicity that he could ever have garnered on his own, and that's brought him to the attention of reasonable people like myself, who literally couldn't have given a shit about him until the world told me I'm not supposed to listen to him. And now I'm considering voting for him just to make a point - not because I like him, but simply because I'm fed up being told who's too scary to listen to, and that I'm too stupid to make up my own mind about someone's ideas.",True,False,False,,0,1556900616,,False,0,{},emf5efj,False,t3_bk7pwu,False,True,t1_emf0sx1,/r/funny/comments/bk7pwu/ladies_gentlemen_we_have_a_winner/emf5efj/,False,,1561473834,1,True,False,funny,t5_2qh33,r/funny,public,0,

Corporatism, now that is an interesting term. I used to use it as something having to do with White Collar activities, sometimes restricted to multinational companies. Yet Corporatism is something that exists today in all functional states and most dysfunctional states. It means that the Government won't bother to deal with individuals. So instead of doctors, you have a Medical Board. And instead of drivers, you have The Teamsters. Or instead of priests you deal with The Church. Many assume that to be a Fascist (as originated with Mussolini) system. And yes, those were the guys that put the concept into words. Only this is the traditional way White Europe used to deal with minorities. Treat them as a foreign, ill meant, collective individual. It's not this Jew has scammed you. That will become ""Jews have an agenda to scam us"". And you decide that you won't deal with the accused, but with an elder, that will be by default guilty and will have to negotiate a ransom.

Neoliberalism. That is funny. The liberals have something to do with liberty. And they were. Back in the 19th century.

With the rise of the Internet, the liberal texts of the 19th century have surfaced among all the Socialist control crap, and more and more people have noticed that the Liberals of the 19th century were mostly on the opposite side from the various forms of Socialism. But as Socialism meant Liberal, the ones talking about the old meaning were labeled as NEO-liberal. The correct term would have been something like PALEO-liberal. In the mean time Paleo has been taken by a diet cult, so something else should be researched.

Man kann eben nur mit Statistiken arbeiten. Natürlich gibt es weltoffene, liberale Muslime. Aber das ist nicht die Mehrheit. Ich begegne jedem Menschen, der nicht schon im Vorfeld ungut auffällt, mit Respekt, und wenn der entgegnet wird, dann steht einem guten Austausch nichts im Weg. Es geht und ging nie darum, ""alle"" abzulehnen. Ebenso wird auch nirgends gesagt, ""alle"" seien gefährlich, fundamentalistisch etc., aber wenn eine bestimmte Gesellschaftsgruppe wesentlich mehr dazu tendiert, ist es eben ungut wenn diese Gruppe immer größer wird.

**Zu 2:**

Das ist etwa so wie das Argument ""Die Christen waren auch für die Kreuzzüge verantwortlich!"". Ja, *waren* sie. In den letzten 100 Jahren gab es immense Fortschritte was Demokratie und Weltoffenheit angeht, unterbrochen von finsteren Kapiteln. Aber wenn man z.B. Europa betrachtet, so haben wir uns eine Situation geschaffen in der es so friedlich, demokratisch und liberal ist wie noch nie. Islamische Staaten haben genau das Gegenteil durchgemacht und sind in den letzten 100 Jahren immer fundamentalistischer geworden. In vielen muslimischen Ländern ist die Scharia Gesetz und du weißt, wie es darum steht. Der Islam hat sich immer stärker radikalisiert. Wenn du heute Staaten vergleichst, die mehrheitlich christlich sind mit denen, die mehrheitlich muslimisch sind, dann sind das völlig verschiedene Welten. Also bitte nicht irgendetwas künstlich konstruieren.

Und wenn du dich über rechte Probleme der FPÖ aufregst, dann denk' mal ein paar Minuten über die Situation von z.B. christlichen Minderheiten in islamischen Staaten nach. Die werden oft genug massakriert und systematisch ausgelöscht. Das ist gar kein Vergleich. Ich verstehe auch absolut nicht, was du mit der Erziehung sagen willst. Klar, wenn eine muslimische Familie liberal ist und ihre Kinder liberal erzieht, wird es weniger Probleme geben. Und dann denk' daran, dass man in muslimischen Staaten u.A. von der Religionspolizei abgeholt wird, wenn man zu Gebetszeiten nicht in der Moschee ist oder zu Hause betet.

**Zu 3:**

There were differences in the response of various sectors, however, most of them believed the situation would not last and that they could ride out the storm. There was good reason for this belief- one is long term and one is short term. The long term lesson of history for the Jews in Germany was that Hitler was not the first antisemite in history; he surely wouldn't be the last, but that the Jewish people had outlived previous antisemites and this would happen again. The short term lesson of history is that from 1919-1933, in the Weimar Republic the average lifespan of a government was a mere 11 months. So, history would indicate that the Nazi government, like its predecessors, would also collapse. Those two elements, the psychological and the political, conditioned the reactions of German Jews. By and large, by 1939, half of Germany's 500,000 Jews had left. By 1938, when the Nazis took over Austria, they had already been in power for five years, so Austrian Jews immediately understood that the Nazis were not going to disappear. So, their reactions were different.

Race and religion are very closely intertwined. See below about disparate impact.

Petit résumé du résumé - car, oui, j'ai pas manqué un seul épisode depuis, cette série a pris en otage mon cerveau.

Ce qu'il faut retenir, c'est que : 

\- Margaux (l'ado qu'Ingrid Chauvin et Mari d'Ingrid Chauvin hébergent en tant que famille d'accueil) était triste car Kylian est en prison pour avoir tué un perso random, mais entre temps BIM elle a fait un déni de grossesse, elle a accouché d'un petit garçon dont le père, qui n'est pas Kylian, est mort ; Margaux a détesté cet enfant, prénommé César mais appelons-le Djéson, alors elle l'a foutu à l'adoption puis s'est ravisée puis finalement s'est FAIT ENLEVER LE BÉBÉ : où est-il ce gosse ?

\- Rose, l'amie d'Ingrid Chauvin qui est bipolaire, est revenue à Sète, sortie de prison pour avoir tué son ex-mari pervers narcissique ; elle était enceinte d'un perso random, elle a fait une fausse couche, mais est persuadée d'avoir accouché d'un bébé en bonne santé DONC c'est elle qu'on suspecte d'avoir enlevé Djéson ;

\- Les grands-parents de Djéson, parents du papa mort donc, veulent à tout prix récup' la garde de l'enfant car ils détestent Margaux et la jugent irresponsable ;

\- Superbe Actrice et Geek Flic, après une rupture, re-sortent ensemble mais Geek Flic aime pas faire trop souvent l'amour (mais mec, t'as Superbe Actrice comme partenaire !!!)

\- Un personnage ado a perdu un bras dans un sombre combo revente de téléphones volés/staphylocoque doré à l'hôpital, Relou (ancienne copine de Geek Flic) a couché avec Maxime le fils d'Ingrid Chauvin qui était en couple avec sa prof d'EPS. Résultat Prof d'EPS veut pas le revoir.

\- Le patron du seul bar-café-restaurant-hôtel-AirBnB-friperie-kebab de Sète est amoureux d'une locataire d'une de ses chambres mais celle-ci lui cache le fait qu'elle vend ses fesses pour avoir un peu plus de sousous.

&amp;#x200B;

EPISODE DE CE SOIR

&amp;#x200B;

Les grands-parents de Djéson ont mandaté un plongeur pour aller sonder la mer DANS LA PROPRIETE D'INGRID CHAUVIN oklm. Ils sont persuadés que Margaux a tué son gosse et l'a jeté à la mer tel un vieux slip dans lequel on aurait eu un problème intestinal lors d'une sortie à la plage. Et ouais, Ingrid Chauvin a une sacrée baraque qui donne direct sur la mer mais je vous rappelle qu'à Sète tout le monde est pété de thune.

Superbe Actrice et Geek Flic font un Scrabble pour passer le temps autrement qu'en mettant un émoji aubergine dans un émoji pêche.

Pendant ce temps, Mamy Seum, la mère de Mari d'Ingrid Chauvin, est hébergée chez son fils car sa maison est occupée scénaristiquement par d'autres persos dont l'intrigue est trop ~~chiante~~ complexe pour que je la raconte. Elle passe son temps à dire à Margaux qu'elle reverra jamais Djéson car elle aussi a connu la disparition d'un enfant, Mari d'Ingrid Chauvin donc, qu'elle a retrouvé quarante ans après. Ma question est : Mamy Seum a-t-elle continué à toucher les allocations de la CAF pendant tout ce temps ?

Rose, soupçonnée de l'enlèvement de Djéson mais en fait les flics de Sète savent pas trop, est transférée de la cellule du commissariat vers une chambre d'hôpital, la même dans laquelle est passé chaque perso de la série qui a eu un souci médical. Peut-être même que sur un des murs, hors cadre, ils ont tous laissé un petit mot du genre ""chuis passé ici moi aussi SÈTE RPZ""

Lorie est toujours absente de la série, c'est difficile. Elle est même carrément absente de la coloc' qu'elle partageait avec Superbe Actrice et Geek Flic. Où dort-elle ? On ne sait pas.

On retrouve le grand-père de Djéson sur la plage, avec son plongeur dans la mer, toujours dans la propriété d'Ingrid Chauvin : ce dernier semble avoir trouvé quelque chose. C'est en effet, un sac à dos avec le pyjama de Djéson lesté par un gros gros caillou.

Ca sent pas bon pour le petit et en plus c'est le week-end alors on saura pas avant lundi.

Per the [official report from Europol](https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/tesat_2018_1.pdf) (PDF) titled EUROPEAN UNION TERRORISM SITUATION AND TREND REPORT 2018, jihadist attacks have been on the rise, but:

In 2017 alone, 16% (33 out of 205) of terrorist attacks in the EU were jihadist motivated. (pg. 54)

What is true is that the jihadist attacks are more deadly, so if you only count the deadlies attacks, then the percentage is higher (though still not 90%).

So I'll start with some background. There are several rocket companies and state run organizations that have been around for decades that basically have a monopoly on the sector. For example, Russia's rocket capabilities are state run. Other companies like Arianespace (Europe), Lockheed Martin, United Launch Alliance, Boeing (USA), heavily depend on state money to run. (I don't know enough about outside of Europe and USA, so I'll stick to these.) Because there is very little competition,and there is secured funding (because its coming from the state), there is no incentice to lower prices and innovate to make better products. These entities are called ""Old Space"".

Then SpaceX comes along. SpaceX is a private company created by (then millionaire, now billionaire) Elon Musk in 2002. Elon's main goal is to make humanity multi-planetary, however, space travel cost so much, so he created SpaceX. He has created rockets that are cheaper to make, more powerful and are reusable. For example, United Launch Alliance (ULA) had the most powerful rocket called Delta 4 or Delta Heavy. Now this rocket cost upwards of $350 millions US dollars to manufacture and launch. SpaceX now has a more powerful rocket, Falcon Heavy, that only cost $90 million US dollars. That is less than a third than ULA's Delta Heavy.

What SpaceX is doing is causing a panic among ""Old Space"". They thought no one else could make space travel cheaper. Now they are forced to try to lower prices and innovate to create better rockets. And get this, SpaceX's rockets are mostly reusable when everyone else's rockets are not. That is a major reason why they can lower prices when others cannot. SpaceX is taking away business from Old Space.

Now companies are suddenly popping up thinking, ""hey, if SpaceX can do it, we can too."" Universities, companies and scientists are better able to afford to send their experiments to space because of lowering prices. These new companies are called ""New Space"". Things are moving quickly and if Old Space can't keep up, they will go out of business.

This is the intent prong. If your intent is to destroy a religious or ethnic group in part, not just certain people who happen to be members of it, the element is satisfied. So if Hitler and various officers and soldiers of the Third Reich had decided they wanted to exterminate all Jews, Catholics, and people of African descent throughout Europe, though not throughout the world, they would have been attempting to destroy those religious and ethnic groups *in part*, and that would still be genocide.

&gt;Rather than link me videos from content creators who are deliberately pushing politically motivated pseudohistory, I suggest you think about the fact that conspiracy theories can be true, and god help us if they are.

There's no need to plagiarize my statement.  But I agree that the foundation of your philosophy is ""feelings over facts"" and fear-driven rather than fact or rationally based.  Eyes on the Prize, unlike the videos you provided, is extensively sourced, cogent and offers multiple different views of the Civil Rights movement rather than one.  For one thing, just because ""conspiracy theories' can be true doesn't automatically mean they are.  That's why you have to critically evaluate the facts to determine if they are true, rather than use the possibility the conspiracy theory could be true as a reason to ignore facts that don't care about your feelings.  

&gt;Now let my list some cases where culture is a direct result of DNA Im just gona list the physical for now.

&gt;Let me tell you your DNA is a blue print for how to build you depending on the environment and DNA also evolves to fit a environment they are linked.

I think I can see the source of your inaccurate assumption of the relationship between culture and genetics. 
You're saying that human biological characteristics ""shape"" culture - but of course all culture is based on human physical existence, in some sense.  **Cultures being based at some level on human physical existence doesn't explain any specific feature of cultural variation.  You have not addressed the point my AAA source brought up about how any human could belong/grow up in/learn any culture because your examples are either wrong (many places like India or the UK use left-hand drive) or come from universal characteristics (the Inuit also wear thick coats to protect against the cold, farmers in East Asia for example also wear hats to shield themselves from the sun).**  Russians wearing fur coats has nothing to do with ""Russian DNA""; any human population that went that far north would need coats.  Your comment about DNA evolving to ""fit"" the environment is only true for a handful of genes (skin pigment, lactase persistence, and disease resistance).  The rest of human evolution has been genetic drift (bottleneck, founder effect etc), aka coincidences.  So, you should read the AAA article I linked as well as other research on culture and genes  before providing non-sourced points that do not support your case.  


&gt;Europians are similar enough to be able to somewhat assimilate in to each others cultures if they want to.

You're overlooking that the US has always had a considerable non-European population (Amerindians, blacks, etc.), that European assimilation took a significant amount of time (Teddy Roosevelt complained about hyphenated Americans at the turn of the century), and that assimilation is not just a ""European"" aspect; Singapore illustrates non-Europeans can also ""somewhat assimilate"".

Se eu usar o mesmo argumento para falar de drogas, dizendo que ""ah os bandidos podem usar drogas e os cidadãos de bem"" você acharia coerente e verdadeira? Eu poderia ainda usar o argumento para falar de coisas mais pesadas que os bandidos fazem, mas acho que só com isso já dá para vc perceber o erro nesse argumento.  O que dá a entender quando eu vejo alguém que se diz cidadão de bem usando esse argumento, é que ele quer ser bandido mas não tem coragem de ir contra as leis, apenas isso.
