Não dei ""piti"" nenhum. Vc deve ser muito sensível.

&gt; Se dicionários, livros que definem palavras, não servem de argumento para você, então você está fazendo revisionismo. Se você inventa suas definições eu não tenho como discutir, pois não sei quais são suas definições pessoais.

Não serve de argumento porque não explica como chegou àquela conclusão. Você, por exemplo, escreveu um monte de lorota sobre ""socialismo"", mas o Michaelis diz que é ""toda doutrina que prega um sistema econômico e político que se fundamenta na socialização dos sistemas de produção e no controle estatal dos setores econômicos."" Ou seja, tudo o que vc disse é invencione e bate de frente com o dicionário.

E quando um autor diz uma coisa, e outro diz outra coisa? Vc confia em qual? É o mesmo caso que debatemos.

&gt; Hitler dizia ser de direita

Ele se dizia socialista -- como ele era --, anti-capitalista, anti-burguesia e anti-marxismo, assim como Anton Drexler e Goebbels.

O Programa do Partido Nazista (que vc mesmo pode buscar e ler) pregava que o Estado deveria sustentar a população; que todo mundo deveria trabalhar não para sustento e benefício próprio, mas para o bem-estar de todos (coletivismo puro); que qualquer renda de herança (ou semelhantes), especulação e afins fosse abolida; a nacionalização de empresas à força; a divisão do lucro de ""grandes empresas"" com o povo; expansão em larga escala da Previdência alemã; reforma agrária que proibisse a especulação.

Ele é tudo o que vc chamou de ""esquerda"".

&gt; O racismo e o fascismo são características da extrema-direita porque são pontos de vista conservadores levados ao extremo.

A União Soviética era racista com judeus, poloneses e ucranianos, e levada ao extremo. Che Guevara dizia que ""negros têm pouco apego ao banho"" e que eram ""indolentes"". Fidel Castro mandava gays para campos de concentração.

Seu argumento (""são características da extrema-direita"") é ruim -- a não ser que vc considere todos estes como ""extrema-direita"".

&gt; o conservadorismo é a manutenção dessas tradições e é parte do que caracteriza os movimentos de direita

Che Guevara era conservador. Fidel Castro era conservador. A URSS era conservadora. Vc viu meus argumentos ali em cima.

&gt; A URSS não era de esquerda: ela era de extrema-esquerda

Extrema-esquerda não faz parte da esquerda? Extrema-esquerda é direita agora?

&gt; Não é de se espantar que você considere qualquer ditadura ou intervenção estatal como ""esquerda""

Eu nunca disse isso.

&gt; Hitler se declarava abertamente de direita

Em que fonte? Qual a página do ""Mein Kampf""?

&gt; é esquecer que no passado o preconceito e a discriminação contra gays, negros e judeus era normal.

Aos 72 anos, ela estava internada desde o dia 8 de janeiro no Hospital Pró-Cardíaco, no Rio de Janeiro. A causa da morte ainda não foi divulgada. Nota publicada na página de [Facebook](//brasil.elpais.com/tag/facebook/a) da cantora informa que ""Nossa querida Beth Carvalho partiu hoje as 17h33, cercada do amor de seus familiares e amigos"".

 ""Beth deixa um legado inestimável para a música popular brasileira e sempre será lembrada por sua luta pela cultura e pelo povo brasileiro"", diz a nota, que segue: ""Seu talento nos presenteou com a revelação de inúmeros compositores e artistas que estão aí na estrada do sucesso. Começando com o sucesso arrebatador de 'Andança', até chegar a Marte com 'Coisinha do Pai', Beth traçou uma trajetória vitoriosa laureada por vários prêmios, inclusive um [Grammy](//brasil.elpais.com/tag/premios_grammy) pelo conjunto da obra"". A mensagem diz que os dados sobre o sepultamento serão informados assim que possível.

 Beth Carvalho chegou a fazer um show deitada em 2018, por conta de problemas na coluna. Quando deu [entrevista ao EL PAÍS](//brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2016/03/11/cultura/1457714455_460596.html) em 2016, a cantora já se recuperava de problemas na coluna após passar um ano hospitalizada — em 2009, ela cancelou uma apresentação durante o show de réveillon na praia de Copacabana, por conta de dores no corpo. Três anos depois, a sambista faria uma cirurgia nas costas. 

 Na entrevista de 2016, a ""madrinha do samba"" falou sobre política e sobre os mais de 50 anos de carreira. ""Antigamente o som do samba era mal gravado, tecnicamente falando. As gravadoras pensavam que era botar um bando de negros lá dentro e diziam: 'vamos lá, batuca aí'. As pessoas não tinham noção de que você tem que ter um microfone para o surdo, tem que ter um microfone para o tam tam, entendeu? A coisa era mal tratada pelas gravadoras. Elas não entendiam o samba. Eu, [Martinho da Vila](//brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2015/10/06/cultura/1444133060_905753.html), nossos produtores, os técnicos, fomos responsáveis por essa melhora.""

 Proveniente da zona Sul do Rio, Beth Carvalho se destacou no samba quando o gênero era ainda muito masculino e ligado aos negros e aos moradores das favelas cariocas. O apelido de ""madrinha do samba"" veio do lançamento de nomes como Zeca Pagodinho, Arlindo Cruz e Jorge Aragão, e de seu trabalho de resgate de cantores como Cartola e Nelson Cavaquinho. ""Eles sofreram muito, eram pobres, melhoraram, modéstia à parte, comigo. Muita gente pensava que o Cartola estava morto e ele veio à tona e a minha gravadora contratou ele, e passou a ter um disco por ano. Com [Nelson Cavaquinho](//brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2016/02/19/cultura/1455836576_674066.html) foi a mesma coisa. Não ficaram ricos, mas a vida deles melhorou bastante. Que é o justo, né?"".

 Entre as várias notas de pesar publicadas pela morte da cantora,se destaca a da escola de samba Mangueira, uma das paixões de Beth Carvalho. ""Com muita tristeza no coração informamos a toda nação verde e rosa que nossa madrinha, Beth Carvalho, nos deixou essa tarde e foi para o andar de cima levar sua alegria junto aos mangueirenses Cartola, Nelson Cavaquinho, Carlos Cachaça, Jamelão entre outros bambas do samba (...)

I’ve never heard it being politicized until the last few years. And I’m going to be honest, I place that blame squarely at the feet of the DUP. I never heard political mention of it until the ILA, and them saying “well what about Ulster-Scots?”. Which is not only stupid, but counterproductive. 

In my opinion the two shouldn’t be compared, nor treated in the same way. They both have very different needs. 

The ILA is about trying to make amends for a terrible historical wrong. Gaelic was the native language of the island for millennia. Spoken and adopted by all waves who arrived on its shores, has the oldest form of written language in Europe, and created the first formal usage of what we call ‘surnames’ now. It was forcibly ripped from the county and it has left a deep wound. 

Ullans is a beautiful regional dialect of Scots. But has adopted Irish linguistic vocabulary and syntax into it too, diverging it from Scots into its very unique Irish version. The two should be kept separate and measures should be put in place to actually reinforce that uniqueness instead of just saying, ah, it’s just Scots, and using their words, phrases and syntax. Books, usage and children’s/adult TV shows and radio should be used to not let Scots (From Scotland) overtake it in Ireland. 

The loss of language is the loss of imagination.

[**Ulfric Stormcloak is *literally* Robert The Bruce, King of Scots**.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wars_of_Scottish_Independence#King_Robert_the_Bruce:_1306%E2%80%931328) Torygg, Jarl of Solitude/High King of Skyrim, who Ulfric killed prior the game, is Lord John Comyn of Badenoch. Robert Bruce wanted to be King of Scots, but Comyn also had a claim. Comyn backed Edward of England. Bruce summoned Comyn to discuss their dispute and the potential of a rebellion against England. During the meeting, Bruce murdered Comyn on hallowed ground. This sparked a rebellion, and eventually lead to Scottish Independence from England. 

Though not all of Skyrim id directly tied to these events. Each group can be associated (somewhat) with other groups and events existing and taking place around the same time. The Imperials are the English, the Bretons are French (from Brittany). The High Elves probably represent the French as well to some extent. The Dark Elves likely represent the death of paganism during the Christianization of Northern Europe (Scandinavia specifically) etc.

I suspect this because I'm, kinda, in a similar boat with my dad. My dad, however, is an immigrant from a European country that's had universal healthcare for decades, so he's not scared of the idea. He know it works and would love for the USA to adopt it. However, he also fears that Bernie's voting block is not big enough because he doesn't trust the majority of Americans.

He is of the opinion that the fact that Bernie calls himself a socialist, even a democratic socialist, means he has no chance of being elected President because Americans just have too much of a knee-jerk fear to anything even remotely related to socialism.

So mine isn't scared of Bernie or his policies, he's more scared of how voters will react to Bernie, so that leads him to think that he can't be the nominee if there'll be any chance of defeating Trump...which, ironically, is how I feel about Biden. Luckily, my dad agrees about Biden, so I've only gotten him so far as not voting for Biden in his state's primary even if he doesn't vote for Bernie instead (Warren was is early favorite).

And my dad isn't a low information voter. He is the kind who spends hours online reading about politics after he gets home from work.

The scientific world could never agree on any one ""IQ"" and is continuously trying to improve upon its concepts. How then, in your opinion, can it be a scientific ""fact"" that a certain group has a higher or lower group than another (on average)?

Literally not true, IQ( intelligence quotient) is just any test used to test intelligence, there are multiple IQ tests that are all accepted as a way to accurately measure intelligence, and they are correlate with each-other VERY heavily anyway. IQ also doesn't seem to change much, even with different levels of schooling. You can even get a brain scan to predict your IQ accurately. If you thow out IQ you might as well throw out all of philology too.

&gt;If you make up randomly or arbitrarily (e.g. by skin color) two groups from a population and look for statistic differences, you will most likely find some. That doesn't make it useful to differentiate between these groups, as their makeup is still random or arbitrary. The differences between individuals of humans are far greater than between any made-up subgroup. And they are lower between ""Asians"", ""Whites"" and ""Blacks"" than between certain ""Blacks"" (some African population) and other ""Blacks"" (another African population) or Afro-Americans (which on average have a lot of European ancestry) - so why does it make sense to make up a group as diverse as ""Blacks""?

Races are not arbitrary, You can predict someones race from their genetics accurately 99.7% of the time. The different group-isms of race aren't arbitrary either, if you asked anyone, even remote tribes, to sort people into the different races, they would come up with groups almost identical. We aren't socialized into seeing race either, even babies are naturally racist. [Race is not arbitrary, if you test the genetics of people across the globe, you will see clear genetic clustering depending on where there ancestors are from](https://imgur.com/a/DepIBJY). Even ignoring the science, we would HAVE to group people like this to look for further explanation for the average differences in group outcomes by race.

&gt;The genetic differences between subgroups of humans are comparatively small and not related to skin color

the idea that people only define race by skin color is idiotic, no one calls albino Africans white. Race is usually socially determined by things like Skull shape, height, Hair color, hair type etc. too.

Oh and the average genetic differences in populations can actually be measured by the fixation index, instead of just saying things out of your ass. The fixation index between american wolves and coyotes is 0.153, Equal to that of Europeans and sub Saharan Africans, but perhaps the differences between coyotes and wolves is purely socio-economic, right? Also the average fixation index in humans does correlate with skin color.

&gt;that's why the concepts of biological races of humans has been dropped

Buy who? Your sociology professor? I hope it hasn't bee dropped by everyone because when the next guy needs a bone marrow transplant and gets it from someone from outside his race and dies that will be a sad moment. No it hasn't been dropped, I dare anyone the get ONE SINGLE academic research paper about race that denies the basis of race with substantial quantitative evidence. The truth is that there are thousands of studies proving the basis of race and differences of IQ in the last 100 years, sure some academics will say race doesn't exist frivolously just to stay out of trouble, but any academic who has actually studied the differences between the races, or IQ who says that would be lying.

&gt;But if you put together such a race by completely different parameters, you'd still find correlated differences. And these do not imply genetic causation either, the causes can be nutritional, environmental, really the whole range of socio-economical differences between such chosen groups or ""races"". That's also why some groupings (say between chimps and humans) make more sense than others.

the thing is that people can easily control for every one of these variables, and have. Even controlling for Education and Yearly income the racial IQ gap remains. You clearly know nothing of genetics research and are just regurgitating something someone else said, as any good genetic study can easily determine a causal relationship between someones genes and IQ or whatever you are studying by just gathering more data about the participants, even if they don't know the  specific gene responsible for the difference.

Title: **Husband physically abused me and is threatening my immigration status**

Original Post: 

&gt; I came to the US from Europe a few years ago, met a person I thought I loved, and eventually married him. After a few months, he started to physically abuse me. I have since left him. In court he is saying none of this happened, and is saying he only married me to get me a visa. I don't have many resources, and am not sure where to turn. I don't think I can afford a lawyer, and want to ensure I can stay in the country with my family. Is there a way to get help for my situation? Thank you very much.

Jon Watts said it ( he is the producer and was the one for Homeco), Feige confirmed it recently hence why it’s the last one of the phase. 

 
I’ve read interviews and basically Fury found free child labor, and is gonna recrut Peter to the world of spies. Watts said Fury sees him as an asset and he can’t deal that Peter would rather be a teen basically.

The producer compared it to his own experience when, when you re a teen and you want to get treated like an adult and then you realize that no you don’t want that but it’s too late people won’t let you go back to before. 

And imo that’s basically Peter traumatized by what happened (I think I read back in 2017 or 2018 that he is gonna get PTSD from his experience. Which IMO Endgame hint on with how terrified he looked )  + what happened to Tony, and not wanting to be an all the time superhero. 
The hints being : leaving his suit at home (and his face when looking at it) + Happy saying « You re all alone now » + when Remy Hii character said « Iron Man », Peter immediately turns to look at him but he isn’t happy  

Last but not least Zendaya (who plays MJ)  Instagram story, where she posted a picture of her crying and distraught face after Endgame viewing, where she wrote that it was her reaction and with knowing what she knows about Far From Home. 

All in all, the movie will deal with the consequences of Endgame. The 5 year gap problem between those dusted ( among the students : Flash, Betty, Ned, MJ, Peter) and not (the new kids I guess who weren’t in Homeco) + the war + particularly with Tony’s loss ( seeing as that’s his 4th time loosing someone, and uncle Ben was like 2-3 years ago without the 5 years time spent)   

Edit to say « So nice to finally meet you, Spiderman » could very well be that Fury wanted to meet Peter before,but Tony was preventing him. Watts said he had wanted to introduce Fury as the « mean substitute teacher » even in Homeco. 

Imo Tony wouldn’t have let Fury drag Peter anywhere, let alone to do dangerous work as he expects him to do, so Fury couldn’t have any contact with him nor did he try.

&gt;His stand against Zionism and a Jewish state of Israel on principle has been accused by Laurel Leff of deliberately burying accounts of Nazi atrocities against Jews in the back pages of the Times.

Firstly, which part of what I just said is fascist. Are you saying that because I don't want **invaders** who do nothing else than destroy our society and culture I am a fascist? Because I stand for nationalism I am a fascist? Is that all you can do? Call us a fascists to make us seem like the evil ones?

And then you put in bold that part as if it was a big deal. As if I had said something morally wrong. If you could not infer that by yourself because you are not aware of Europe's current situation then let me make it clear. **I do not call them apes because of their skin colour, which is what you understood, but because of their actions.** 

There is no other word other than ape for someone who only comes to your country to kill your people, rape, acid attacks, terrorism, child trafficking, burn churches, etc. We don't want them here because the great majority of them only do that, and leftists just want more of them here. They kill us for our religion and skin colour and we welcome them. 

Not too long ago, if one those 'refugees' burnt a church, which is a symbol of christianity the religion Spain did so much to protect and spread around the world, almost a symbol of Spain, that 'refugee' would have received untold suffering and probably be burnt alive. Nowadays we greet them and welcome them: 'yay fuck our religion'. Now I'm not saying let's burn 'refugees', hell no, but let's have a little self respect please. 

On top of that they don't even learn our languages, especially in Germany, where more than half of the 'refugees' don't even pass basic German lessons. Or Sweden where less than 10% of the 'refugees' don't want to accept the free basic education they are offered.

I mean if she'd handed you a check, it would still be appalling, but eight fat stacks?! What the hell was she thinking?

Look. I agree in a way that she deserves to lose the money if she's going to be this stupid, and you can get your vasectomy secretly in another month or your wife could get a tubal or bisalp. I don't consider it stealing (it was offered freely but under loose, non-contractual, and incredibly stupid terms). But just be warned that taking that amount of money from people who don't respect your life choices can become its own sticky mess.

Boomer parents with their irrational expectation that they *own* you and you *owe* them grandchildren, are not to be taken lightly. I just read an article today about baby boomers ""mourning"" that they may never become grandparents (THE HORROR!) because *millennals* aren't breeding quite as early or often as past generations, and it was full of quotes from outraged, entitled *angry* people in their 60s who truly believe they are being denied a fundamental right if their children don't produce some grands. ""It's the tragedy of my life!"" said one woman quoted in the article, whose only child is childfree. I think this type of nonsense your mom tried to pull is going to become more common. Expect more people on this sub to say they've been cut out of wills for getting a vasectomy, or offered a much-needed down payment on a house *if they got pregnant*, and other horrifying stories of financial manipulation from deeply entitled, selfish parents. 

So I think your initial instincts to see this as an assault on your independence was correct. I'm not saying don't take the money, necessarily, but I am saying that accepting that amount of money is going to give your mother a strong sense of having one-upped you. If you really have the balls to take it, get the snip in actual secret, and then as the years go by and no grandbabies show up and she gets pushier and angrier and says things like ""I get you *eighty thousand dollars* so that I could get a grandchild!!* (even though that isn't actually what she said) just shrug and say ""But we still use birth control and haven't changed our minds yet,"" then great! I know *I* am capable of bending to financial pressure, since I have a lot of financial anxiety, and the idea of someone being able to look at me and say ""you wouldn't have such-and-such (that down payment, that car, that trip to Europe, that much in your retirement account) without *me*"" would be dangerous for me and my autonomy.

La deuxième, c'est qu'elle a joui au moins une fois et peut être plus (J'ai pas osé lui demander). J'y tenais vraiment et c'était sexy de l'entendre gémir, j'ai toujours cru que c'était un truc de film porno ça.

La mauvaise nouvelle, c'est que j'ai tenu longtemps (35~40 minutes) car je ressentais quasiment rien. Non seulement je n'ai pas joui mais je sentais à peine son vagin. J'ai eu du mal à conserver une érection tout du long, il y a eu des phases demi-molles. On s'est arrêté car ça commençait à lui faire mal.

C'est clairement pas de sa faute, elle a un corps magnifique, des seins fermes à croquer. 

Je ne suis pas sûr que ça soit la capote. Après qu'elle soit partie, j'ai essayé de me caresser pour voir (sans capote) et rien, 0 sensation. J'ai déjà eu de temps en temps des orgasmes très forts en me branlant quand j'étais célibataire donc mécaniquement, tout est censé fonctionner.

À 4h du matin, je me suis réveillé avec la trique, j'ai essayé de me caresser et les sensations étaient revenues.

Pas vraiment compris et un peu inquiet. J'ai trois hypothèses :

* nervosité. Comme c'est la première fois, je me suis bloqué sans m'en rendre compte (pourtant je me sentais bien).

* préservatif : soit c'est pas les bons (j'ai utilisé durex feel thin) soit le latex m'a anesthesié le pénis.

* trop de porno, masturbation. J'ai lu qu'on pouvait s'habituer à jouir d'une certaine manière avec l'habitude d'être stimulé à la main et visuellement avec des gros plans de vagins et de queues. Je m'étais pas masturbé pendant 2 jours avant et étrangement, la recontrer m'a fait bien moins apprécier et avoir envie de me masturber, même avant qu'on fasse l'amour. Là, ça fait 3 jours sans éjaculation et 1 et demi sans porno.

Si vous avez une idée/opinion je suis preneur !

Pour finir sur une note positive, on est resté allongé nus sur mon lit à discuter et à se câliner pendant 1h après et j'ai adoré ça, parler en étant détendus à poil et en train de passer la main sur son corps.

Din fericire tipul a fost mega deschis, a fost de acord sa faca proba si sa-mi trimita orice benchmark  sau stress test am cerut (si am cerut cam tot ce se putea cere) si chiar mi-a trimis serial numberele si a fost de acord sa nu accept coletul daca nu se potrivesc. 10/10 would buy again de la ala desi mi-a mega stat morcovul in cur pana am pus piesele in pc si nici nu se poate vorbi de garantie.

He refers to them as such because that's literally [how they're called](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Greeks) by modern historiography. Medieval Western Europeans themselves generally refered to the Byzantines as ""*the Greeks*"".

The reason being, that, most especially past the 7th century and on, when it was gradually reduced to its strongholds of Greece and Anatolia, **the Byzantine Empire was societally and culturally Greek**. 

That's literally *History of the Eastern Roman Empire 101*.

&amp;nbsp;

Also a chapter of *History of the Eastern Mediterranean 101*, as the entire region had been slowly (but partially) hellenized for a thousand years, starting in the 4th century BC. 

Where it gets funny is that the Romans themselves pretended they were descended from the Greeks (Romulus and Remus were allegedly descended from Aeneas, who fought in the Trojan War) and emulated their culture. The acculturation became even more pronounced after the conquest of Greece and the subsequent, willingful self-hellenization of the Roman society.

In a way, Romans somewhat culturally identified as Greeks. It doesn't mean they actually were.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;there wasn’t a Greek identity around even 500 years after the Sack of Constantinople.

There very much was a [Greek identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Greeks#Identity), not only by 1704, but even centuries before. Greek nationalism, like any other nationalism, is rooted in cultural self-identification. That culture didn't pop out of thin void in the 19th century.

That claim is entirely absurd.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Every Byzantine identified as a Roman

Again, ""*identifying as X*"" is not the same as ""*being an X*"". They identified themselves as Romans because in their eyes, they were the only remaining part of the Roman Empire - which was effectively the case, as the political and administrative continuity wasn't broken until 1204, and then definitely in 1453.

They were nonetheless culturally Greek, and in the medieval ERE, the practical reality of being ""Roman"" was conflated with the Greek culture.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;But it’s the same Youtuber who uploaded a video with the title ‘Ancient Greek kingdom in India’, and of course his gullible audience fell for it.

Calling the audience of that video ""gullible"" is somewhat ironic, when yourself don't know what you're talking about.

There was, in fact, a [Greek kingdom in India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Greek_Kingdom), a stem of the [Greco-Bactrian Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Bactrian_Kingdom), itself a remnant of the conquest of Alexander the Great.

[],Virtuallyalive,1407601100.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_hstnc,False,"Yes, scientific racism was popular in Europe just like it was in America in the late 19th century. 

&gt;The French aristocrat and writer Arthur de Gobineau(1816–1882), is best known for his book An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races (1853–55) which proposed three human races (black, white and yellow) were natural barriers and claimed that race mixing would lead to the collapse of culture and civilization. He claimed that ""The white race originally possessed the monopoly of beauty, intelligence and strength"" and that any positive accomplishments or thinking of blacks and Asians were due to an admixture with whites. 

And further on

&gt;Following the creation of the first society for the promotion of racial hygiene, the German Society for Racial Hygiene in 1905—a Swedish society was founded in 1909 as ""Svenska sällskapet för rashygien"" as third in the world.[105][106] By lobbying Swedish parliamentarians and medical institutes the society managed to pass a decree creating a government run institute in the form of the Swedish State institute of racial biology in 1921.[105] By 1922 the institute was built and opened in Uppsala.[105] It was the first such government-funded institute in the world performing research into ""racial biology"" and remains highly controversial to this day.[105][107] The goal was to cure criminality, alcoholism and psychiatric problems through research in eugenics and racial hygiene.[105]As a result of the institutes work a law permitting compulsory sterilization of certain groups was enacted in Sweden in 1934

A lot of it centres on Anglo-Saxons in England, but there's a lot of quotes

E.g. Churchill

&gt;In 1937, he told the Palestine Royal Commission: ""I do not admit for instance, that a great wrong has been done to the Red Indians of America or the black people of Australia. I do not admit that a wrong has been done to these people by the fact that a stronger race, a higher-grade race, a more worldly wise race to put it that way, has come in and taken their place.""

And Cecil Rhodes

&gt;Rhodes advocated the governance of indigenous Africans living in the Cape Colony ""in a state of barbarism and communal tenure"" as ""a subject race. I do not go so far as the member for Victoria West, who would not give the black man a vote. ... If the whites maintain their position as the supreme race, the day may come when we shall be thankful that we have the natives with us in their proper position.""

People saying that Europe doesn't forget that the driving force behind the colonisation of not only Africa but the Middle East and Asia was ""The White Man's Burden"", the idea that all white people were inherently superior to non-white people. Countries like South Africa and Rhodesia established Apartheid the exact same way as segregation existed in America, while being European colonies. And of course the Nazis views on race are essentially the same as the KKKs. Maybe there's more a distinction between like Slavs and Romani and 'White People' but that's the biggest difference. As for France

&gt;National Front is an extreme-right party which openly claims its nationalist and conservative ideals. This party was initially led by Jean Marie Le Pen, who has often been considered to be the spokesperson and face of the party. Le Pen has been reprimanded many times for racist actions and the National Front has been held responsible for a couple of race-based crimes.[44] For example, in 1995, three militants of the National Front party shot at two young boys of African origins who were running to catch their bus. One of the young boys, Ali Ibrahim, a 17-year-old from the Comoros Islands, was fatally wounded. Bruno Megret, who was 2nd in command of the National Front at the time, stated that this event was due to ""massive and uncontrollable immigration"" in France. He added that he was thankful that his militants had been armed.",True,False,False,,0,1556702659,,1556702977,0,{},em7kvvy,False,t3_bjcrde,False,False,t1_em7govk,/r/todayilearned/comments/bjcrde/til_that_after_becoming_the_first_white_man_to/em7kvvy/,False,,1559409463,18,True,False,todayilearned,t5_2qqjc,r/todayilearned,public,0,

I’d invite a look at [this report](http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/19155938/Restrictions-IX-FULL-REPORT-WITH-APPENDIXES.pdf) from the Pew Foundation. It’s a little dated (2016), bit it shows a fairly remarkable uptick in religious persecution across all surveyed religions. In western and European countries this is especially true for Muslims and Jews, since the most recent onset of nationalist popularity. A glance at the table on page 26 of the Pew report lays out one metric: the number of countries where religiously were harassed. One might notice that Christians are still on the top of that particular list, the sharper increase for other religions notwithstanding.

The table on page 32 of the Pew report is also quite helpful, as it narrows in on the 25 most populous countries, and the incidence of both social and government hostility toward religion in general.

[],ladsen1,1511622275.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_m37jc6m,False,"Honestly, I think the whole issue of racism is highly blown up by the Media. 
I personally live in an area where pretty much 100% have Swedish ethnicity - so my personal experience could perhaps not say too much. However, one shouldn't refer to personal experience too much either way.

What I can say is that people have definitely become more critical towards our immigration policies. Is that the same as Racism? I think not. 
There are plenty of arguments for why people are critical towards it. Should a country, that has a crisis within every public sector, in a globally economic boom, really focus on increasing our population so much? 

A fact is that, a welfare system and huge immigration, does not go well together. The reason why the U.S managed to take in so many immigrants in the past is because they were not a big cost for you guys. You welcomed people here, but told them that it was up to them to get a job etc. In Sweden, we give them everything for free and most of them do not start contributing to society after years. Immigrants women sometimes do not ever do it. It is a huge economical stress for us. 

Furthermore, experts claim helping locally is a lot more effective than geographically relocating millions of people. It just does not make any sense.

Also, that our elderly people get thrown out of their homes so that immigrants have somewhere to stay does not help the polarization in this question. Immigrants even get dental care for free almost, while most of our retired force barely cant afford it. They also get housing easier than Swedish citizens. These indifferences has caused disagreements among people, for sure.

HOWEVER, are we racists? According to World Value Survey we are the most tolerant country on earth with a bit less than 1% of our population have problems with being neighbor with someone of another ""race."" That number is, for example, 40% in India, and 30% in North Africa. Even if we are the country who has taken in the most immigrants in the EU, p/c.

Being sentenced for 10 years for selling it is just ridiculous. Sentences like these are given for murders and stuff like this.

I just think it's ridiculous and the hypocrisy of society when it come to certain drugs is just limitless. Especially when you see a lot of civilised countries, where marijuana is decriminalised and not far away from them, there is somebody serving 10 years sentence.. In the country with one of the biggest alcohol consumption per capita in Europe. I am sorry, it just makes me angry, such hypocrisy and injustice, but I am just repeating myself..",True,False,False,,0,1556712278,,1556712468,0,{},em7toy1,False,t3_bjelw4,False,False,t1_em7t100,/r/soccer/comments/bjelw4/liverpool_ceo_we_proudly_sing_that_weve_conquered/em7toy1/,False,,1559413603,5,True,False,soccer,t5_2qi58,r/soccer,public,0,

Não sou sequer experiente e certamente no sub especializado você vai encontrar coisas melhores, mas algumas impressões / opiniões:

1. Você está sempre jogando contra a casa

A casa sempre ganha e eles têm os dados de todas as apostas já feitas e equipes especializadas pra definir quanto vão pagar pra cada resultado para maximizar os lucros. 

O bom é que o objetivo deles (e eles são muito bons nisso) é ganhar dos clientes como um todo, não de você individualmente. Isso passa, inclusive, por oferecer retornos mais atrativos que os concorrentes e que incentivem as pessoas a jogar. 

O seu objetivo é conseguir vencer individualmente num jogo cujas regras são adversas (você tem bem menos que 50% de ganhar jogando na média). 

Como? 

O cálculo deles é principalmente matemático. Então você tem que recorrer a uma informação que o computador não usa ou analisar melhor que ele as informações disponíveis. 

A galinha dos ovos de ouro seria jogar dados numa planilha e achar uma fórmula que te desse palpites lucrativos no longo prazo de forma consistente a partir desses dados. Evidentemente, isso é muito difícil, ou as casas quebrariam. Até pq são públicas as estatísticas de futebol e das odds de aposta no passado. Então, em teoria, você pode testar essa fórmula com o que aconteceu antes pra ver se funciona, sem risco. 

Você não sendo um gênio da matemática, o diferencial pode ser uma análise técnica / tática do jogo melhor do que as outras pessoas e, em alguma medida, a boa e velha intuição. 

Por exemplo, é provável que eles vejam o CSA (por enquanto) como outros times da Série B que subiram em condições parecidas. 

Se o CSA for mais saco de pancadas do que esses, apostar contra ele pode ser lucrativo. Acho que o seu plano vai nesse sentido. 

Mas... A inteligência artificial pode não ser humana, mas ela pensa com dados fornecidos por humanos. Indiretamente, ela processa a intuição / análise de milhares de humanos a partir dos dados de aposta. Se de repente todo mundo começar a jogar contra o CSA, a taxa cai imediatamente.

Por isso eu gosto de apostar ao vivo. Tem jogo que você vê que o time fraco tem uma chance legal de marcar num contra ataque... e às vezes isso tá pagando 9x. O computador só tem os números, não está assistindo o jogo. 

2. Mesmo apostando certo, você pode perder pq tá fazendo apostas muito grandes para o seu caixa 

Ainda que você tenha uma fórmula que te dá uma vantagem e na média você esteja ganhando, se você apostar todo o seu dinheiro a cada vez, você vai acabar perdendo. 

Digamos que uma aposta esteja pagando 2x e a chance real de ganhar seja de 51%. Fazendo muitas apostas, você acaba ganhando no total, é uma fábrica de dinheiro. Só que se você apostar 100% do seu caixa, você pode perder de primeira e acabou. Quanto mais pequenas apostas você fizer, mais próximo do 51% de acerto você chega. 

Há fórmulas pra controlar esse risco, procure. 

3. Nunca aposte no seu time

Você pode achar que está sendo racional, mas é difícil separar. Somos otimistas por natureza. 

4. Apostas viciam

Cuidado. Aposta vicia, de verdade, e destrói vidas. Uma aposta de 5 reais pode deixar qualquer jogo sem graça da Série C mais emocionante que final de Libertadores. 

Estabeleça X reais por mês que você dispõe pra gastar com isso e nem um centavo a mais que não seja lucro das próprias apostas. Esteja preparado pra perder tudo. 

5. Apostas matam o esporte

Se individualmente você pode ser responsável e limitar os riscos e efeitos negativos das apostas, para o esporte como um todo é mais difícil. Apostas criam um incentivo constante à manipulação de resultados. 

Enquanto houver apostas vai ter jogo sendo comprado em algum lugar. 

Se isso te desmotiva a jogar ou não é uma questão pessoal. 

Espero que tenha ajudado!

The imperial measurement is actually fairly fascinating. While not as convenient as the metric, it does make sense. For measurements they very often used body parts as a reference. To make things easier they measured the ruler/king as the standard reference, which sounds ridiculous but you need a standard of measurement at the end of the day and who better than the ruler.

A mile for example was made by the Roman Empire as 1000 paces (1609m)

A pace which is a double step is 1.64 yards (149.96cm) 

A Single has Step is 0.82 yards (74.98cm)

Are you thick or just trolling?

I'll name two America or Australia.

The world has an overpopulation problem but the UK doesn't. We have a population centralisation phenomenon which means everybody wants to live in the same place i.e. big cities - London, Manchester Birmingham etc. We still demolish a lot of houses in this country so it can't be as much of a crisis as you think.

You're contradicting yourself because you said Japan doesn't let in immigrants but yet they're over populated. Japan has an ageing population and that's it's problem.

[],Antal_z,1543631101.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_c7wnsbw,False,"Starting salaries I see here in the Netherlands are about EUR 40k, for master's degree in STEM or CS. Compared to \~60k for the US outside of the valley and New York. The differences are also large for tradesmen, like welders, plumbers, electricians etc. They are around 45-50k in the US, and more like 30k here.

It blows my mind that nobody in Europe seems to have a problem with this. It just completely blows my mind. Healthcare is often cited to explain it, but health insurance in the US isn't 10k+ per year, and besides we're talking pre-tax incomes, not post-tax. Our taxes are also far higher than in the US, in every conceivable way. Income tax, payroll tax, fuel, alcohol, VAT/sales tax, everything I can think of. Only property taxes are apparently quite high in some parts of the US.

In my opinion, the reason for the discrepancy is the completely dickered economy we have, europe-wide. Just look at the tech boom of the last 40 years. Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, all worth hundreds of billions, all of them offering thousands of jobs that pay &gt;100k each. Compared to such staggering creation of value, what does Europe put forward? Skype, Minecraft, SAP. Looking on a more macro level, US interest rates are up to 2% now, while the ECB is still at a solid 0. There's no growth to be seen.

Entrepeneurship is dead, which means competition is dead, which means competition on the labor market is also dead. Competition gave the US a Falcon 9, a Falcon Heavy, maybe soon a BFR. What's our answer? Ariane 6. Ariane. Flippin. 6. We have no new players coming up and kicking things up. We only have the same ancient large companies that we've had since the 60s or before. 

Sidenote, people often assert that entrepeneurship is dead because access to capital is poor. This is a copout, it's intelectualy lazy and convenient. Why, pray tell, is access to capital so terrible here?

Ultimately, our taxes are too high, and our regulations are to burdensome and strict. As to the latter part, I can only speak for the Netherlands, but allow me to give one example. Suppose you start a new limited liability company in the Netherlands. You are now an employee of your own company. This means you have to register with the tax authorities of course, but I'll leave that aside for now. What salary will you pay yourself? 45.000 euros. Why you ask? Because the government mandates that you do so. They are afraid that you will pay yourself dividends rather than salary, which is taxed less. The tax service can also mandate higher pay if they deem that ""usual"". How the actual fuck is that supposed to work when most early companies are built largely on sweat equity?

Final sidenote, VAT is much more of a bottomless hellhole than people like to think or pretend it is. If you're in the US, resist implementation of VAT as much as you can.

Stating that the EU is a failed state because it's all about German capitalists abusing cheap foreign labor is so beyond the point. I live in the Netherlands, and we have many Polish and Romanian guys working here, bringing back money to their country. Poland has become so rich that more and more people stay home because they don't need Dutch or German euros.

Nawet Marine Le Pen gdyby dorwała się do władzy to by zmieniła śpiewkę  i zrobiłaby się Madame l'Europe (mais l'Europe nouvelle). Co innego kit dla ciemnego luda a co innego realpolitik. Większość ""anty-europejczyków"" kocha koryto bardziej niż suwerenność.

Do Brexitu doszło w drodze wyjątku:

* Po pierwsze 40 lat polityki anty-unijnej wewnątrz wspólnoty zrobiło swoje. Mem się utrwalił jak zaraza której nie można zaleczyć.
* Po drugie Wielka Brytania nie ma tradycji politycznych na kontynencie, a ma za to marzenia o powrocie do Commonwealthu. To że wrócą jako kolonia nowego hegemona do nich nie dociera (a do niektórych dociera i dlatego chcą).
* Po trzecie Brexit wydarzył się bo ludzie byli sfrustrowani sytuacją gospodarcza - w szczególności szokiem cenowym na rynku nieruchomości który skutecznie trzyma ludzi w ryzach. A to jest problem samej Wielkiej Brytanii a nie Unii. Niestety ponieważ UK to kraj bankierów i landlordów nie wolno mowić o przekrętach na ziemi i dlatego wciska się inne bzdury typu ""imigranci"". Polecam poszukać na sieci - jest projekt ""who owns Britain"" który pokazuje prawdę o tym jak bardzo klasowo wysegregowane jest to społeczeństwo.
* Po czwarte Wielka Brytania zaliczyła większy szok niż inne kraje bo polityka gospodarcza Gordona Browna byla *katastrofalna*. 
* Po piąte za Brexitem popłynęły pieniądze od amerykańskiej prawicy i wspieranych przez nią ludzi na wyspach. Taki Rupert Murdoch siedzi okrakiem i w Australii i w Wielkiej Brytanii i w USA i ewidentnie poczuwa się być lojalnym wobec Waszyngtonu najbardziej (bo tam największa kasa i władza). To nie Rosja a Amerykanie dali impuls bo dla amerykańskiej prawicy osłabienie UE jest z korzyścią dla USA a wyrwana z Unii Wielka Brytania jest fantastycznym celem do skolonizowania. Notabene nam próbują zrobić to samo - Międzymorze to amerykański projekt destabilizacji UE.

Natomiast Polexit w Polsce raz że wymagałby załamania gospodarczego w UE które jednoczesnie nie pogrąży Polski - tak by sprzedać bajkę ""bez unii będzie nam lepiej"" - a dwa wymagałby zainwestowania w Polskę by coś zasymulować. A widać gołym okiem że USA nie chce inwestować tylko szuka frajera.  Pasuje im ze Polacy biegają jak debile na amerykańskim pasku podczas gdy Unia funduje zabawę. Rosja z kolei będzie paradoksalnie Polskę do Unii wpychać tak długo jak Ameryka robi coś w Europie bo wtedy jest bójka między USA a Niemcami o terytorium (vide PiS prowadzony przez USA i PO prowadzone przez Berlin). Dopiero jak Ameryka się zwinie na Pacyfiku Rosja może chcieć dogadywać się z Niemcami. A tu tez Unia jest nam potrzebna by Niemców w ryzach trzymać bo mimo iż prawdą jest że Niemcy na Unii najbardziej skorzystali to jest to też kaganiec który sami sobie założyli. W ramach Unii jak Niemcy podskoczą to mamy opcje - Francja, Włochy, Hiszpania, Holandia...

Dobrze że nie przyjęliśmy Euro. Bo wahania na rynkach by mocno nastroiły ludzi anty-UE. Euro to bardzo chybiony ekonomicznie projekt - przede wszystkim koncepcja polityczna - i póki nie zostanie naprawiony (co wymaga większej centralizacji UE) nie ma co się do niego pchać.

Quantas dessas manifestações realmente acontecem, e quanto dessa imagem é graças a um esforço de manipulação da opinião pública para desvalorizar a imagem do estudante por meio de mentiras? 

Eu já recebi várias correntes na internet denunciando o horror de manifestações nudistas na UFMG, mas em todas elas não só não houve nenhuma manifestação nos dias em questão, como também as fotos que usaram pra ilustrar as correntes foram extraídas de outros lugares. Já vi imagem de campo nudista na Holanda na década de 90 sendo usada como prova de ""protesto Lula Livre na UFMG em plena segunda de manhã, A ESQUERDA NÃO TEM VERGONHA NA CARA"". Isso demonstra que quem critica/denuncia esses movimentos muitas vezes age de pura e simples má fé, então como confiar que todas as denuncias sejam verdadeiras?

- Every router your connections passes through can sniff and log your details.
- If you run e-commerce, anyone who cares about security will refuse to shop on your site. I have often refused to purchase things from websites that don't implement TLS, even if the payment gateway does.

&gt; GENEVA - A European Union trade lawyer fired withering put-downs at U.S. claims for damages due to subsidies for European planemaker Airbus in a recording of a dispute hearing made available by the World Trade Organization on Tuesday.

&gt; The EU lawyer, whom diplomats identified as James Flett, described some U.S. claims in the case as &amp;quot;Frankly childish&amp;quot; and said some of the data appeared to have been provided by Airbus&amp;#039; U.S. rival Boeing Co. The two firms&amp;#039; rival claims have fueled almost 15 years of litigation at the WTO. After both were found to have received illegal subsidies, each side wants to gain the upper hand by winning the right to trade sanctions to compensate for economic damage.

&gt; &amp;quot;The EU is wrong,&amp;quot; the U.S. lawyer told the hearing.

[],JBinero,1420495146.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_kj54m,False,"&gt; Assange's rights under UK law are a matter of UK law and guaranteed by UK law (while in the UK at least). There was never any doubt that his rights under the law would be respected.. What he did do was flee a legal process when it didn't seem to be going his way..

That is incorrect. His rights at that point were already violated multiple times, including the right to the presumption of innocence and a fair trial. Furthermore, if there was no intention to make him face refoulement, the judiciary could have simply made this clear.

&gt; Again, Sweden issued an extradition request, that is totally in line with UK and Swedish law. The UK was happy that Sweden wanted him to answer a charge in Sweden that was appropriate under Swedish law. The fact that the Swedish process for charging and investigating a crime is marginally different from that in the UK doesn't undermine that.

&gt; You make it sound like Sweden was arbitrarily asking for Assange to be extradited without cause, it wasn't, that's pretty clear.

In fact, this is not what European Arrest Warrants are for. Sweden was not able to produce any evidence that the allegations against Assange were credible, and failed to even put any charges. The European Arrest Warrant is not something that should be taken lightly. As the European Parliament put it, this is not something you use against someone who has been charged with multiple car thefts. 

&gt; Yeah, often you do. Even in the UK, usually you are arrested when there is enough information to support an arrest, then the police will investigate further (and you may be released with no further action, or you may be charged..). The extradition process is effectively that, a request to affect an arrest.

There is no evidence, and there was no formal investigation. 

&gt; Sweden requested that Assange be extradited because he refused to return to Sweden voluntarily. Assange then availed himself of the UK court system to fight that extradition. When that didn't work, he breached his bail conditions and hid in an embassy.

Because he had no obligation to go to Sweden. He offered his full support to cooperate with the investigation remotely, as is not unusual for innocent but even citizens under investigation who are abroad to do. 

&gt; There is no way you can look at this and claim that Sweden or the UK breached the law or didn't apply the appropriate process. Assange however deliberately breached the law after giving assurances (And guaranteeing those with other peoples money) and put himself out of reach of both the UK and Swedish authorities..

Whether the law was broken or not is irrelevant. Everyone has a right to a presumption of innocence, and through clever legal manoeuvring Swedish prosecutors and the UK judiciary were able to bypass that right and arbitrarily detain Assange for years.",True,False,False,,0,1556730221,,False,0,{},em8migk,False,t3_bjfnjr,False,True,t1_em8lfwz,/r/worldnews/comments/bjfnjr/julian_assange_has_been_sentenced_to_50_weeks_in/em8migk/,False,,1559427739,0,True,False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,r/worldnews,public,0,

A maypole is a tall wooden pole erected as a part of various European folk festivals, around which a maypole dance often takes place.

The festivals may occur on May Day (May 1) or Pentecost (Whitsun), although in some countries it is instead erected at Midsummer. In some cases the maypole is a permanent feature that is only utilised during the festival, although in other cases it is erected specifically for the purpose before being taken down again.

Primarily found within the nations of Germanic Europe and the neighbouring areas which they have influenced, its origins remain unknown.

We did the shipment through a moving company affiliated with Unigroup Worldwide. Yes, it would have been a bit cheaper to purchase the freight directly but not by much. By using a moving company we didn't have to deal with all the paperwork stateside, rental of the container,  transportation and temporary storage of the container, safe packing of the container, insurance, customs and port fees in Spain, parking permits on our street, and probably more. With everything we had to do to pack, move, find an apartment, bureaucracy to get registered and get IDs here, etc., all while working long hours, I can't imagine if we had to worry about all this. It wouldn't have saved that much money overall. We probably wouldn't have been able to be reimbursed for the couple of items that were damaged (insurance companies typically won't cover self-packers). And the usual moving company conveniences like rebuilding furniture and getting rid of the boxes was worth probably 2-3 weekends of working on that stuff. Frankly, it would have been a nightmare without a moving company.

We also pared back as much as possible, sold a bunch of stuff, and put other things in storage (a family member's basement).

It is the youth party of the PvdA who's full name is 'Young Socialists in the PvdA' and when you sign up for the PvdA you also get the option to become a member if you're below 25. But yeah, they have a separate leadership and they are allowed to have different opinions.

 &gt; Exactly, you didn't define it any way. That is because the only definition possible is ""government doing stuff"" if you would be correct, and that wouldn't exactly be convincing.

Nothing doing something isn't equal to doing something.

&gt; Let me ask you, if the PvdA are socialists then why are the VVD not also socialist? Both parties support capitalism with welfare programs, do they not?

Because PvdA are a social democratic party which called for the privatization of industry and the socializing of private property at some point. They are also a member of the Party of European Socialists and member of the Socialist Internationale. 

VVD are liberals who split from the PvdA because they disagreed with the socialist road they went down right after being formed in 1946. None of the things that the PvdA has apply to the VVD. 

&gt; You literally said that the idea that welfare was invented to keep socialism at bay was commie propaganda. Otto von Bismarck was the first one to introduce modern welfare and according to him it was to keep socialism at bay. So was Von Bismarck a commie or do you take back what you said?

I said that when it comes to social democrats, who helped design the modern welfare state, it's a myth. That's all.

In 2017 the Swedish allegations were dropped. Assange remained in Asylum.

In 2018 America stated Assange was not named under sealed indictment. Then due to a clerical error [publicized](https://pacer-documents.s3.amazonaws.com/179/399086/18919235200.pdf) that he was in fact named in sealed indictment and currently under investigation. Specifically done so until such a time as Assange can no longer avoid extradition

In 2019 Assange is finally forcefully ejected from the embassy against his will and immediately begins procedure to revoke an anticipated extradition. Also in 2019 Manning is re-incarcerated for refusing to testify against Assange and [other witnesses](https://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKCN1PH2UN) are pressured to testify. Meanwhile Sweden considers re-opening its own case.

&amp;#x200B;

Frankly it's *possible* he's been hiding from Sweden. By all accounts he's quite an unpleasant and possibly unhinged person. But the reasons he, his associates and Ecuador all give seem far more rational.

Either he sought international asylum to avoid potential prosecution for investigated and as-yet-unpressed charges regarding an alleged sexual assault with easily disputed intent, consent and culpability, in a country with notoriously low conviction rates for reported rape. For a crime punishable with 2-6 years on average and a statutory max of 10, he remained in a self imposed 'imprisoned' state of asylum for seven years, the last two of which Sweden had effectively dropped all charges. Alongside this he also successfully convinced the political leaders of an entire country and their embassy staff, his associates, and political benefactors around the globe that he was *actually* hiding from something else entirely.

Or he sought international asylum to avoid a country infamous for its refusal to be a signatory to various international agreements on human rights, war, death penalties and treatment of prisoners, that was actively pursuing him regarding crimes it had sentenced his associate to 35 years for and attempted to inflict the death penalty for 'aiding the enemy', implicitly labeling him an enemy of the USA. Seven years on into his self imposed 'incarceration' said country is *still* actively pursuing him, and has imprisoned people for refusing to testify against him.",True,False,False,,0,1556742523,,False,0,{},em984h0,False,t3_bjfnjr,False,True,t1_em8xag2,/r/worldnews/comments/bjfnjr/julian_assange_has_been_sentenced_to_50_weeks_in/em984h0/,False,,1559437892,4,True,False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,r/worldnews,public,0,

It is a question that needs asking: does Theresa May actually think that Brexit voters are stupid? She is certainly behaving that way, apparently convincing herself that the Eurosceptic electorate will welcome [any deal she cooks up with Jeremy Corbyn](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/04/30/theresa-may-preparing-cave-labour-demands-brexit-eurosceptics/), however appalling, as long as she labels it “Brexit”.

The nonsensical, insulting implication is that those who want to leave the EU are as thick, uneducated, and prejudiced as their “progressive” opponents love to claim; gullible fools who only care about ending “free movement”. Fobbing off such half-wits should be easy: just sign a deal, any deal that can be spun as delivering on this one symbolic goal, and they will flock back gratefully.

The reality is that it is hard to know for sure what the Prime Minister is thinking, if anything: she is the most evasive holder of that office in living memory, according to a University of York study. It is easier to gauge the dominant view in the bunker at No 10, now mired in deep, catastrophic denial about the imploding support for the Tories and establishment in general.

As far as the small group of Remainers now running the show is concerned, the public never really wanted to leave the EU: they would have been content with a minor renegotiation focused on immigration of the sort David Cameron was seeking.

 

By that (pathetically low) standard, Mrs May’s deal – even with a disastrous customs union attached, as demanded by Labour – would represent a major achievement, substantially more than Mr Cameron could ever have dreamt of. So how can anybody reject it? Who cares if the EU still sets many of our rules, or if we cannot sign trade deals?

There is no alternative, the Remainers believe: the “philosopher kings” in Brussels have made it clear that this is their final offer, a no-deal will be blocked by MPs and be hated by the CBI, the arbiters on economic matters, and an explicit revocation of Brexit will enrage voters.

It is therefore a no-brainer, they argue: the deal must be signed, at any cost, allowing the past four or five years of our collective political memories to be erased, and what’s left of the Tory party can focus once more on truly important policies, such as banning ice cream vans.

This approach is staggeringly wrong-headed. It betrays an utter lack of understanding of what motivates Eurosceptics, including most Tory voters, as well as millions who see themselves as more Left-wing. It confirms that despite Mrs May joining the Tories in the mid-Seventies, she no longer understands her activists.

Most important of all, it entirely fails to grasp the significance of what Dominic Cummings, Vote Leave’s campaign director, calls “branching histories”: there was a referendum, and Leave won, so everything changed forever. It may well have been that Brexit wasn’t such a salient issue a few years ago, but now it is and the clock can never be turned back.

 

Anything short of a full implementation of what Brexiteers thought they were voting for will be seen as a betrayal: at least 15 per cent of the electorate, and possibly well over twice that number, will never forgive the Tory party. That is enough to annihilate it. This is no longer just a theoretical risk: the success of Nigel Farage’s slick new Brexit Party attests to that. Millions care deeply about leaving the EU, and their anger is palpable.

The political reality has shifted in four fundamental ways. First, the Tory base no longer trust Mrs May: they will not accept her deal, its time has passed. Ratifying it will not finish off Mr Farage, nor will it see his votes return “home”. It’s too late, the government’s narrative is obsolete. When gauging whether or not the deal is compatible with the referendum result, the voters will listen to Mr Farage, whose influence is increasing, not to Michael Gove, whose popularity is decreasing. The Tories are no longer haemorrhaging support because they haven’t signed a deal: it’s because they appear to be dishonest and not to believe in anything.

The second, is that the Brexit Party will stand against all MPs who back the deal: on current polling, over 60 will lose their seats, ushering Mr Corbyn into office. When combined with the Tory grassroots rebellion, and the local elections, my guess is that far fewer Tory MPs will back Mrs May’s deal if it is returned to Parliament. As to Labour, why should it rescue a dying, imploding Government?

The third is that there is now, once again, an acceptable alternative to the Tories for disgruntled Conservatives and Eurosceptics. The Brexit Party appears far more mainstream than anything that came before it, from Veritas to Ukip. Mr Farage has learnt the lessons of Leave.EU, and it shows.

All of which brings us to the most important way in which the landscape has been transformed: the Tories should be talking to Mr Farage, not Mr Corbyn. The only way to stop a hideous hard-Left government and the permanent, catastrophic splintering of the centre-Right is for the Tories and the Brexit Party to somehow unite. That requires a new Tory leader who isn’t scared of no deal, and who can put together an optimistic, electorally successful economic vision that puts pro-growth tax and regulatory changes at its heart.

 

James Kanagasooriam, an excellent political analyst, argues in The Spectator that demographic data shows how a purely Cameronian Tory party would do roughly as well as a purely “national” pro-Brexit one. Mrs May’s attempt at triangulation has satisfied nobody: he says the party should choose one or the other.

I don’t accept that such a choice is required. Tories can still do better than they did in 2017 with pro-business, younger metropolitan voters, while also delivering even more Eurosceptic voters, including in the North. They can unleash game-changing tax cuts and promote entrepreneurship, creating an attractive alternative to Corbynomics; and they can deliver a hardcore Brexit for the Eurosceptics. There can be enough progress to enthuse both demographics, making it possible to forge an election-winning coalition.

The only question now is whether the Tories will opt for a leader with the guts and appeal to build such a broad movement, or whether they have already given up.",True,False,False,,1,1556747486,,False,0,{},em9h7of,True,t3_bjn065,False,True,t3_bjn065,/r/ukpolitics/comments/bjn065/the_tories_should_be_allying_with_nigel_farage/em9h7of/,False,,1559442153,2,True,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,r/ukpolitics,public,0,

By sticking with your tribe, you could protect your scarce resources from outside raiders, or if your tastes ran the other way, you and your tribe could gang up to steal other people's stuff.

Racism per se was not invented until the 15th-16th century. Before that, discrimination was based on tribal things like what city you were born in, what tribe/religion you belonged to, that kinda thing. In most cases, it was not considered hereditary. People did not look at whites/blacks/etc as *a single people.* That still amounted to a fuckton of discrimination, perhaps way more than today, but it was not racist, because the concept had not been invented yet. The Romans would quite cheerfully enslave some barbarian, but if his next-door neighbor swore unconditional fealty to Rome, he could be welcomed as a full Roman citizen. Rome even had a couple of African Caesars.

In Spain, there were Jews who The Church had forced to convert to Christianity, the ""conversos.""

That is, it was decided that Jewishness was *literally* in the blood, and therefore, once a Jew, always a Jew, yea, unto the thousandth generation. ""Purity of Blood"" laws began to spring up all over Europe.

In the 16th century, that concept was extended to the general notion of a ""race,"" a group of people that was biologically separate from other groups, and--conveniently--easily-identifiable by the color of their skin or other such phenotypic traits. Human races do not actually exist in biology, and geneticists and other scientists tossed the notion into the dumpster entirely back in the 1950s (more recently, advances in ancient DNA in the last 20 years have driven an even bigger nail in the coffin of race). Sure, you can group people by white/black/whatever, but the group you produce has no scientific significance, and if your goal is to figure how how people are actually related, grouping them by ""race"" will give you WRONG answers.

Today, people are racist essentially because they have been taught to be.

Only high-class men in this era were allowed to learn writing, but fortunately all spoken Japanese words were represented by Kanji. People of other classes (generally, women in mass) decided to adapt their own simpler writing style to represent the sounds in Japanese and write words, etc. This became the Hiragana system. When later Europeans made their way to Japan, they had phonetics that were difficult to represent using the Hiragana system without confusing one of either party.

We get assaulted by liberals because male genital mutilation belongs in the conversation with female genital mutilation (by the way, they ARE comparable). But they have cognitive dissonance about this so they assume we're anti-feminists (I identify more as a humanist, but hold many feminist beliefs about gender equality, so I am not anti-feminist by any means). The issue w/ liberals is they're more science-minded, so they point to the health benefits re: STDs, UTIs, etc. The issue is the health benefits are backed by poor, biased, and poorly interpreted research.  
  
We get attacked by conservatives because conservative politics and religion really go hand-in-hand. American Christians (most of them), Jews, and Muslims vehemently defend circumcision.

Circumcision is a REQUIREMENT of Orthodox and Conservative Jewish males, not just tradition or a culture.

[],williambotter,1542234059.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_2lm23pua,False," O ministro da Justiça e Segurança Pública, Sergio Moro, disse nesta quarta (1º) que a promessa do presidente [Jair Bolsonaro (PSL) de dar um salvo-conduto a proprietários rurais ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/04/bolsonaro-quer-isentar-de-punicao-proprietario-rural-que-atirar-em-invasor.shtml)para reagirem contra invasores de terras ainda é uma discussão ""prematura"". 

 Questionado sobre esse tema durante entrevista à rádio Jovem Pan, ele evitou se manifestar sobre a proposta, dizendo que ainda precisaria conversar com Bolsonaro. 

 ""São questões que estão sendo discutidas dentro do governo. Antes de ter no papel exatamente o que vai se propor, quais são os limites do que vai se propor e tal, é muito prematura essa discussão"", afirmou. ""Eu, sinceramente, não me sinto confortável em discutir esses assuntos. São questões que eu ainda tenho que falar com o presidente, ouvi-lo, discutirmos e colocar algo sólido no papel"", completou.

 Na segunda-feira (29) , ao participar da Agrishow (Feira Internacional de Tecnologia Agrícola em Ação), em Ribeirão Preto (a 313 km de São Paulo), Bolsonaro disse que enviará à Câmara dos Deputados projeto para isentar de punição proprietários rurais que atirarem em invasores de suas áreas.

 “É a forma que nós temos que proceder. Para que o outro lado, que desrespeita a lei, tema vocês, tema o cidadão de bem, e não o contrário”, afirmou o presidente à plateia formada por ruralistas.

 O salvo-conduto prometido por Bolsonaro para os proprietários de terra que reagirem às invasões, porém, esbarra na Constituição, [segundo especialistas ouvidos pela **Folha**, para quem a medida poderia ser derrubada no Supremo Tribunal Federal](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/05/constituicao-e-entrave-para-salvo-conduto-previsto-por-bolsonaro-a-dono-de-terra.shtml).

 Para eles, embora a Carta Magna garanta tanto o direito à vida quanto o à propriedade, o primeiro tem peso muito maior.

 Bolsonaro adotou discurso radical desde a campanha eleitoral contra movimentos que costumam invadir prédios ou áreas públicas e privadas.

 O então candidato chamou de “bandidos” representantes do MST (Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra) e do MTST (Movimento dos Trabalhadores Sem Teto) e disse que as ações desses grupos seriam tipificadas em seu governo como terrorismo.

 Na entrevista à Jovem Pan, Sergio Moro voltou a defender a permanência do Coaf (órgão de inteligência que atua detectando movimentações financeiras atípicas) sob controle do Ministério da Justiça.

 Há no Congresso um movimento para que o órgão deixe de fazer parte das atribuições do ex-juiz da Lava Jato.

 Moro disse que tem conversado com os congressistas e que nem o ministro da Economia, Paulo Guedes, defende o retorno do órgão ao controle de sua pasta. ""Ele tem uma série de preocupações. Tem a nova Previdência, a questão dos juros, tem que pensar no desenvolvimento econômico.""

 ### Recuos e derrotas de Moro

 **Decreto das armas**  
 Seu primeiro revés foi ainda em janeiro. O ministro tentou se desvincular da autoria da ideia de [flexibilizar a posse de armas](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2019/01/bolsonaro-assina-decreto-que-flexibiliza-posse-de-armas-no-pais.shtml), dizendo nos bastidores estar apenas cumprindo ordens do presidente. Teve sua sugestão ignorada de limitar o registro por pessoa a duas armas —o decreto fixou o número em quatro

 **Laranjas**  
 No caso do escândalo de [candidaturas de laranjas](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/02/entenda-as-evidencias-e-as-versoes-dos-envolvidos-em-esquema-de-laranjas-do-psl.shtml), enquanto Moro deu declarações evasivas, dizendo que a PF iria investigar se “houvesse necessidade” e que não sabia se havia consistência nas denúncias, Bolsonaro determinou dias depois, de forma enfática, [a abertura de investigações](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/02/bolsonaro-manda-pf-investigar-laranjas-e-diz-que-bebianno-pode-voltar-as-origens.shtml) para apurar o esquema

 **Ilona Szabó**

Oppression and the stealing of labor happens regardless. He did kind of like it because he believed the continuing expansion of capitalism would eventually bring its downfall, but he also hated it because he viewed it as a weapon that the advanced capitalist countries use against the weak and poor countries to bully them into entering the capitalist system.

practical free trade; the protective duty is only a palliative, a measure of defence within free trade),
established means of communication and the modern world market, subordinated trade to itself,
transformed all capital into industrial capital, and thus produced the rapid circulation (development of the
financial system) and the centralisation of capital. **By universal competition it forced all individuals to
strain their energy to the utmost. It destroyed as far as possible ideology, religion, morality, etc. and
where it could not do this, made them into a palpable lie**... In the place of
naturally grown towns it created the modern, large industrial cities which have sprung up overnight.
Wherever it penetrated, it destroyed the crafts and all earlier stages of industry. It completed the victory
of the commercial town over the countryside. ...**Generally speaking, big industry created everywhere the same
relations between the classes of society, and thus destroyed the peculiar individuality of the various
nationalities. And finally, while the bourgeoisie of each nation still retained separate national interests,
big industry created a class, which in all nations has the same interest and with which nationality is
already dead; a class which is really rid of all the old world and at the same time stands pitted against it.
Big industry makes for the worker not only the relation to the capitalist, but labour itself, unbearable.**

Later, from Capital, on trade as a weapon of sorts, although it arguably could be about colonies, but Marx didn't give a fuck about brown people so I doubt he cared. 

&gt;The discovery of gold and silver in America, the extirpation, enslavement and entombment in
mines of the aboriginal population, the beginning of the conquest and looting of the East Indies,
the turning of Africa into a warren for the commercial hunting of black-skins, signalised the rosy
dawn of the era of capitalist production. These idyllic proceedings are the chief momenta of
primitive accumulation. On their heels treads the commercial war of the European nations, with
the globe for a theatre. It begins with the revolt of the Netherlands from Spain, assumes giant
dimensions in England’s Anti-Jacobin War, and is still going on in the opium wars against China

Finally, the most explicit he gets, in the Manifesto of the Communist Party, which is really just a more explicit restatement of the previous paragraph

&gt;The bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations. It has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his “natural superiors”, and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest, than callous “cash payment”. It has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water of egotistical calculation. It has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up**that single, unconscionable freedom — Free Trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.**",True,False,False,,0,1556755494,,False,0,{},em9tn43,False,t3_bjffg8,False,True,t3_bjffg8,/r/centerleftpolitics/comments/bjffg8/daily_discussion_thread_may_01_2019/em9tn43/,False,,1559447987,6,True,False,centerleftpolitics,t5_3oilk,r/centerleftpolitics,public,0,

'A ""black and white book of terrorism in Europe"" has just been published on the initiative of a European MEP, Maité Pagazaurtundua, who lists the 753 people killed in terrorist attacks between 2000 and 2018 on the territory of the European Union.

The study also counts ""Europeans who have been victims of terrorism outside the Community borders during the same period"", that is to say 1115 people, whether they are tourists, expatriate workers, humanitarian staff, journalists, agents Armed Forces ... In all, 1868 people were killed, aged from one to 90 years, who are listed in this book, made with the assistance of the French Association of Victims of Terrorism (AFVT). **The vast majority (1,703 people, 91.1%) were victims of ""jihadist terrorism"", with nearly 20% of suicide bombings.**

111 people were victims of ""nationalist terrorism"". Far-right and far-left terrorists killed 14 and 13 people respectively. One person has been a victim of ""animal terrorism"" (for 26 people, the origin of the terrorist act is unknown or without complaint).

In addition to the names of the victims are their age, nationality and profession. The date, the place, the type of terrorism of which they were victims, and the weapon used are also specified. ""Forgetfulness is the worst thing"" and this book is ""the way to remember them"", said Elisabeth Pelsez, interministerial delegate responsible for helping victims of attacks, Tuesday during a press conference in Paris. ""The victims are the dead part, let's not forget the physically or psychically injured, about 10 to 20 people for one death,"" she insisted.

France, just behind Spain, is the second European country most affected by the attacks during the period studied (268 deaths in Spain in the last 18 years, 263 in France). If we add the French killed in attacks outside the EU, 379 people died. Spain and France are also the two countries of the Union to have experienced large-scale attacks, on March 11, 2004 in Madrid (191 dead, committed by radical Islamists) and on November 13, 2015 in Paris and in Paris. suburbs (121 dead, claimed by the Islamic State group).

In addition to the count of victims, the book proposes ""a map of terrorism in the European Union from the point of view of victims"", with several charts depicting the evolution of terrorism over the years, the types of attacks and the type of terrorism.'",True,False,False,,0,1556760073,,False,0,{},ema0biy,True,t3_bjowch,False,True,t3_bjowch,/r/The_Donald/comments/bjowch/jihad_books_literally_the_title_of_yellowcovered/ema0biy/,False,,1559451118,1,True,False,The_Donald,t5_38unr,r/The_Donald,public,0,

(That way being the rostral-caudal organization of the frontal lobe, aka front to back  of the frontal lobe with back being closer to the motor area, but it is not a perfect front to back.  Furthermore it is not just rostral-caudal but also the parallel orthogonal loops of the cortical-&gt;basal ganglia-&gt;thalamus-&gt;cortical and cortical-&gt;pons-&gt;cerebellum-&gt;cortical)

Tx and Fx functions are language games we play, they do not rest in a single brain area but are part of a network of brain areas that are far away from each other but these brain areas converse.

Furthermore besides functions not being limited to a specific brain area how you image these brain areas have all forms of accuracy and precision problems as this image demonstrates.

Notice with fMRI how long / out of date the information is.  Oh you asked a question and the question shows this brain area was light up in the last second, but it does not really tell you how long it was used and so on.

Other neuroimaging techniques have their own limitation for example EEG you can tell based off the millisecond but you can only view brain activity on the outer area of the frontal lobe (no medial frontal lobe, no basal ganglia, thalamus, brainstem, etc) and it lacks precision of space even though it is more accurate on a temporal frontal.  What do I mean by this?  The EEG can only tell a general area this brain area was active but it can measure changes quickly, but brain cells can be very different in what they can do even if they are a fraction of an inch next to another brain area.

never said they couldn't, and it's not like they have control over that anyway, they just end up either suffering or beneffiting from whatever their government does


&gt;Secondly, relying on your domestic market is more expensive than relying on an international market. If Greece were to have moved their production from abroad to the domestic market, inflation would also have occurred.

I'm not denying this, I'm just saying if you're in a position where you're barely selling anything even if you're not concentrating on your exports, you might devalue just so you can sell more exports anyway. anyway, the main issue here isn't whether devaluing your currency works or not, but whether a country gets its own say or joins the euro


&gt;Third, countries will a lower standard of living like Greece benefit from countries like Germany with a higher standard of living, because they can produce cheaper and sell for more. Germen workers aren't competitive compared to Greece ones. What is competitive though is German infrastructure. Your argument that rich countries can make higher quality products is nonsense because to them, given the same circumstances, producing a product is more expensive than in a country with a lower cost of living.

yes in terms or labourers german workers are clearly more expensive, but in terms of exports germany flies very high. It is possible that germany has certain goods that it makes which can be sold globally at a competitive rate due to their devalued currency whilst having relatively expensive workers. for example, germany are known for good cars, so they are selling a premium good for a little cheaper than it should be.


greece on the other hand will struggle to be able to afford the human and physical capital required to make premium goods despite having the cheap labour, but they wouldn't have the funds to afford all of the resources anyway.


&gt;Different EU countries have different minimum wages. This means poorer countries can produce goods cheaper and then sell them more expensively in rich countries. 

they can only produce goods cheaper if they can afford the capital and labour to produce said goods, I'm sure that FoM coupled with free trade can make that tricky with foreign business able to operate anywhere within the single market at a rate that's cheap for them abut expensive for the locals.


&gt;This would not be possible without a single currency.

&gt;The lower developped countries are the ones that benefit the most from the EU. Their growth has been astronomical, especially when compared to their peers that did not join the EU.

## Sanskrit

**Subreddit**: r/sanskrit

**ISO 639-1 Code**: sa

**ISO 639-3 Code**: san

**Location**: India; Uttar Pradesh state: Allahabad, Jaunpur, Kaushambi, and Pratagarh districts; Delhi and other urban areas; revival efforts in villages.

**Classification**: [Indo-European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language)

**[Wikipedia Entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit)**:

&gt; Sanskrit (IAST: Saṃskṛtam; IPA: [sə̃skr̩t̪əm]) is the primary liturgical language of Hinduism; a philosophical language of Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism, and Jainism; and a literary language and lingua franca for the educated of ancient and medieval India and Nepal. As a result of transmission of Hindu and Buddhist culture to Southeast Asia and parts of Central Asia, it was also a language of high culture in some of these regions during the early-medieval era. Sanskrit is a standardized dialect of Old Indo-Aryan, having originated in the second millennium BCE as Vedic Sanskrit and tracing its linguistic ancestry back to Proto-Indo-Iranian and Proto-Indo-European. As the oldest Indo-European language for which substantial written documentation exists, Sanskrit holds a prominent position in Indo-European studies.

The differences between a Fascist and  European liberal/American conservative are numerous. The Fascist will increase regulation and state control of key industries, Indeed, their desire is to create where private industry is, ""everything for the state, nothing outside the state, nothing against the state."" The fascist will not support rights to freedom of religion, speech, self defense, or due process. 

Its not really all that interesting to examine the policy differences between socialists and fascists, because they are so similar, its more interesting to examine their motivations and why they fight so much. It is because of outgroup preferences. For further reference please see this post that explains it much better than I can.

To their credit, the ANC does try to govern correctly, but is generally pretty bad at it. they will get 50 something percent of the vote.

&amp;#x200B;

The DA is also has roots in the struggle against apartheid, but they were the ""white resistance"" and even though the party is pretty multi-racial they are still veiwed as a white party by a majority of the country, and since people vote on racial lines, and the white population is less than 15% of the total pop.

To their credit, the cities they currently run are very well managed. they will get 20 something percent of the vote.

The EFF is a relatively new party, if you are angry about something, this is the party for you. they want to change the country to socialist, and maybe drive the white people into the Sea, they aren't sure about that, some of them say they would rather shoot the white people and others are nicer and just feel that they must just handover their possessions and land and go back to Europe peacefully.

Tirpitz was the second of two Bismarck-class battleships built for Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine (navy) during World War II. Named after Grand Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, the architect of the Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy), the ship was laid down at the Kriegsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven in November 1936 and her hull was launched two and a half years later. Work was completed in February 1941, when she was commissioned into the German fleet. Like her sister ship Bismarck, Tirpitz was armed with a main battery of eight 38-centimetre (15 in) guns in four twin turrets. After a series of wartime modifications she was 2000 tonnes heavier than Bismarck, making her the heaviest battleship ever built by a European navy.After completing sea trials in early 1941, Tirpitz briefly served as the centrepiece of the Baltic Fleet, which was intended to prevent a possible break-out attempt by the Soviet Baltic Fleet.

I'm less sure on what to do in terms of identity matters. I hope love and understanding of being many things (and also a unique person underneath all the identifiers) will be enough when maybe one day they will be looking for a pre-chequed box to fit into. Neither of us have really had that need before, but I see lots of people who are coming of age in this era struggle with their identity in ways that we never did - I don't have a strong connection to the country/ancestry I did not grow up in, and my wife has a solid identity as her ancestries even though she grew up in the US. I'm not sure what is ""better"", and if there even is such a thing.

About the smaller artifacts, I'd say no, there's no need to return anything. There are thousands if not tens of thousands of beautiful Greek pottery in the world, Greek museums couldn't possibly display even 1% of that, so it makes more sense to keep them dispersed in the world for educational purposes. I think that most people would agree with this. I'd return a part of them only in cases where the country of origin doesn't even have anything to showcase, if the colonists/invaders/etc took or destroyed literally everything. But I don't know if such a situation actually exists.

Of course, it's with the masterpieces that the debate is more complicated. The country of origin wants to showcase the very best of its culture, but these are often also the main pieces in other countries' museums. As others have said, returning a masterpiece to a very unstable country would be a big no-no in most instances, but the issue is that nobody can know what countries will be unstable in the future. Western Europe, where many of these artifacts are situated, wasn't exactly very stable less than one century ago, and there's no way to know what will be the situation in one century from now.

There is also another issue, and that is the issue of the legitimacy of a country to appropriate an ancient culture. Modern Egypt certainly doesn't look one bit like the Egypt of the Pharaohs. Modern Greece isn't the same as ancient Greece. Iraq has almost nothing to do with the Babylonian empire. Why would modern peoples have any claim to ancient artifacts? They didn't make them, their parents or grand parents didn't make them. There's no way to know if their ancestors made them, as peoples moved during the subsequent centuries. So I think that the legitimacy of countries of origin could be challenged, but that's a difficult call to make. What is certain is that culture is a social construct and peoples like to depict themselves as successors of other peoples, with claims often more grounded in a nationalist discourse than in reality.

Finally, and probably most importantly, we have to think about the impact these masterpieces have where they are compared to what they would have where they'd be transferred. The Elgin marbles, hung several meters above the ground on the Parthenon would certainly be in a more authentic situation, but how useful would they be, seen several meters away, from the ground? Aren't they better in one of the most visited museum on Earth, for educational purposes? Again, I'm not saying they shouldn't return. Actually, as they are part of a building that is still standing today, they are probably the more legitimate artifacts to return in the world. I just say this so that everyone thinks about where these pieces are the most useful in the grand scheme of things. After all, when something is such a masterpiece that it is deemed *World* heritage, isn't it the heritage of every Human on Earth?

So what? The ideas are still wrong and racist. The fact they were widespread once shows how racist society was then. That is no excuse for a favourable review ignoring this now. What is more the book claims that this is a factor driving imperialism.

&gt;like i said, if you are a member of the labour party, you are a member of a party based on anti-capitalism that was shot through with what we now know are antisemitic conspiracy theories. many celebrate keir hardie, without ever mentioning his antisemitism (""""modern imperialism is really run by half a dozen financial houses, many of them Jewish, to whom politics is a counter in the game of buying and selling securities”).

Which is most concerning. Especially given how far antisemitism has reached of late.

&gt;the tacit understanding is that he was ""of his time"", and we know better now, that his ideas were simply coloured by the beliefs of the day, but the basic principles hold regardless. which they do. how could anyone in good conscience follow a party based on his beliefs if they didn't believe they could be divorced from his prejudice? and no, you don't need to introduce that caveat every time you bring up keir hardie.

Again, if it was just the author that would be one thing, but it was his work that used antisemitic ideas as arguments. The text itself is antisemitic, and ignoring this or excusing people ignoring this frankly enables such bigotry to remain. Even today many hold onto the notion that Jews are inherently rich and control the world's banks, being over-represented in and controlling many areas. This must be addressed for the modern reader. Someone today writing a foreword should comment on these issues.

You can discuss the ideas but you must separate the constructive from the destructive elements. 

How do you fail to realise that you are already going much further than Corbyn did? You show how simple it is to point out that such ideas were the product of their time but are wrong, yet Corbyn could not in spite of writing a full foreword for the text.

&gt;it doesn't make you a racist if you read oliver twist and don't point out that fagin is the most appalling antisemtic stereotype (although, i also think it is more than fair to point that out, the novel repeatedly calls him ""the jew"", so it is pretty unmissable). should dickens be consigned to the scrapheap of history, written off as an appalling racist? i mean, he absolutely was. you could do that, or you could choose to ignore the problematic stuff as ""of it's time"". neither would be ""wrong"". or you could hold both of those opinions, accept the good, and reject the problematic. again, that's not ""right"" or ""wrong"". there is no ""correct"" way to read history.

Or you could when discussing the man point out his bigotry, separate that from the good things he did bring, and at the same time not fawn over works that were racist uncritically.

You really don't get it. You can criticise a person's racism and still discuss the constructive ideas they did bring. You can do this for their works. But to do this, you must address the issues and not pretend that they don't exist.

&gt;like i say, we recently had a debate on this (revisionism vs contextualism) about churchill. it is helpful in my view not to have a binary view of history, reducing it to good guys vs bad guys. by the morality and understanding of today, there are very few who are ""good guys"" with no caveats.

Indeed, which is why you must discuss the caveats, the issues, for a more complete understanding and to clamp down on racism today.

&gt;back to this text though. like i say, it's thrust is the view of imperialism driven by capital. it's called ""imperialism: a study"". it's not an incorrect view of imperialism. the link between imperialism and capital was real. the analysis was important at the time and still holds today in many ways. i don't think it makes you racist to ignore the stuff that's based in the prejudice and ignorance ""of it's time"", and focus on the underpinning ideas.

Actually it does, or at least it shows that you don't really care about bigotry enough to consider it a problem. If you accept the entire book's arguments and claims as Corbyn did when praising them, then you are choosing not to address the problems, but to treat them as with the rest of the ideas and promote them. In a time when bigotry is rising everywhere, this is incredibly irresponsible at best.

&gt;i mean, the take away from this book wasn't that it was a big book of antisemitic conspiracy theories and hobson was a hate preacher until literally yesterday. before that, it was a book in the ""20th century liberal tradition"", ""worthy of study"", and part of a bbc series on ""great british ideas"":

Germany, which went all-in for renewables, has seen little reduction in carbon emissions, and, according to our calculations, at Germany’s rate of adding clean energy relative to gross domestic product, it would take the world more than a century to decarbonize, even if the country wasn’t also retiring nuclear plants early.

For the money they spent on renewables, they could have been COMPLETELY co2 free for energy generation.

&amp;#x200B;

France replaced almost all of its fossil-fueled electricity with nuclear power nationwide in just 15 years; Sweden, in about 20 years. In fact, most of the fastest additions of clean electricity historically are countries rolling out nuclear power.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm all for renewables and progress, again anything is great.But your picture of renewables is exactly what you accused me of when it comes to nuclear.

Its not just about cost. Its also about scale, we dont just need to replace we need MORE aswell.

I always liked this example to:  Ivanpah solar farm produces 18 times less electricity while using 290 times more land than Diablo Canyon nuclear plant.

That used to be the largest solar farm in the world i believe.

The sheer amount of environmental destruction both to mine the resources to make these solar farms, as well as the land they use is staggering.

Then when they are end of life there is NO solution for their waste.

&amp;#x200B;

But about cost China builds these reactors at one sixth of the cost one would cost in the US.

Probably one sixth of the time to lol.

as a former chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission put it, while France has two types of reactors and hundreds of types of cheese, in the United States it’s the other way around. In recent decades, the United States and some European countries have created ever more complicated reactors, with ever more safety features in response to public fears. New, one-of-a-kind designs, shifting regulations, supply-chain and construction snafus and a lost generation of experts (during the decades when new construction stopped) have driven costs to absurd heights.

&amp;#x200B;

There also is no actual solution for large scale energy storage.

These peak demand plants with nitpicked numbers from when the sun is shining are nice, im all for them.

But when its night these things wont do squat.

How will you generate the needed power then?

2.) It has a multitude of reasons. Brainlets will say ""iTs SocIaLiSm"", when venezuela has a bigger private sector and less state intervention then fucking Norway. The problems started to arise when the OPEC lowered the oil price and therefore crashed the venezuelan revenue which it needed for its expansive social programms. Another problem they had was of course the private sector, which withheld food from the market and bunkered it down in the famous storages that the Venzuelan government seized at the height of the food crisis. A third contributing factor is the US, who imposed sanctions officially in 2015 i think, but has previously been notorious for sending wrong, broken or defective equipment to venezuela, which they NEEDED to keep their oil industry alive. Of course the overreliance on Oil, the monoculture in the country was a pretty bad factor too. A fourth key factor is Maduros insanely dumb decision to turn on the printing press, when the US froze 300 Billion dollars in oil revenue, effectively bankrupting the Venezuelan state. I would say that both decisions (having money in the US and turning on the printing press when that gets stolen by the US) where pretty dumb though i dont know what other options Maduro had. A fifth part is economic sabotage. I think this surfaced most openly when power stations across the country where attacked and shut down or when storages full of food suddenly burnt down, but the government SAYS that such things had already happened before, only then they still had the resources to rebuilt and restack.

I mostly frequent how to subs because that is my interest and then some of the larger subs like funny and pics .. and I will admit yes .. I come here for TD which has also seen problems in the past ... for the past 24 hours I have been fighting off an attack in other subs because users look at my comment history and saw I frequent TD so they think I am an open target that no one will defend... I am not a mod of TD .. I use to Mod CordCutters until some power user/ friend of the admins saw I was a TD visitor and they picked a fight with me breaking sub rules and targeting me directly and the head mod of CordCutters who got his spot because he stole it from the previous creator of the sub decided he would kick me who was #2 mod instead of defending basic sub rules.

&amp;#x200B;

So I say this because this is what is happening on Social Networks

It seems where things were fine for years they no longer are fine.

You can neither have your say or opinion... and if you are on the wrong side of it no one will defend you even if the other person is the one in the wrong.

Its a mob mentality because these ... others... many who have ulterior motives  such as shutting down others more than adding any contribution to the site are seeking a takeover.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically this has happened to twitter. You see even members of congress and verified accounts being locked or quieted or shutdown... 

We have seen people be deplatformed from a group of major sites because of some supposed but non existent  violation on just one site.

&amp;#x200B;

What do they say as a conservative I defend your rights.. and if the content is legal that would extend to NSFW subs which I may not agree with the content but its not up to me to agree if its legal and allowed on the site.

&amp;#x200B;

But Advertisers won't live with it.. they will pull their ads and that is pretty much it.

You have seen what happened to YouTube.

I still know of a female who sometimes shows her family in her videos. Shes from China married to an American and youtube went through and locked all her comments and removed them from her videos basically making her account useless so she hasn't posted for months except one live stream this week where she explained what YouTube did and how she has no way around it and they won't work with her.

But she has done nothing.. its not her fault.

&amp;#x200B;

so thats the way it is today.

&amp;#x200B;

My presence on the internet goes back to about 1985... i had network access through a college.. this was before .com domains.. chats were by telnet not irc.. you had to put your telnet app into binary mode to transfer files because there wasn't any FTP availability.. there wasn't HTTP websites .. news groups were all text and there were only a handful of servers in the world... even on a T3 I would timeout to Japan.

You know that time long before Al Gore invented the internet... 

when it was just people like me building it.

&amp;#x200B;

If this is the decision of reddit to move to a platform where people can't have respectable conversation... where people can't share ideas even if they are ideas you might not want to hear...

If they have to move into that type of situation because of their advertisers

or because they choose to from their own preference.

&amp;#x200B;

The end users.. the mods .. really won't have any input on it

&amp;#x200B;

The internet has changed from the wild west where people believed they were free to a highly monitored and monetized business....

the scrutiny and fine granular detail of tracking is beyond acceptable

cross indexing of platforms, sharing of information without your understanding its not great.

&amp;#x200B;

But this is what Computers do.. this is what they always could do...

people thought they were anonymous but they never were

people thought they had the right to free speech but they never did

you play within the rules or you can't play at all

and heaven forbid you offend the wrong person... 

&amp;#x200B;

So OP I wouldn't worry about what their decision will or won't be because it will be made without your input or negotiation or consideration.

It will either be because of business or the standards of the owners.

But the funny thing is this level of extortion that the left has is effective and the rest of us have no say and you really have to wonder why they are so successful. 

&amp;#x200B;

In reality just like they want to shut down TD they want to shutdown NSFW and maybe not for the same reason but still it is a purpose they have.. political speech .. or maybe offensive speech to some.

&amp;#x200B;

But there won't be places to run to in the future that is the main thing

&amp;#x200B;

If you didn't like facebook or twitter or where ever .. you came to Reddit ... maybe

and then eventually reddit

and then eventually 4chan

and then where ever else

&amp;#x200B;

Its not a matter of IF... its a matter of when and how long

&amp;#x200B;

And if another startup tries to replace these platforms we have already seen that the ISPs the server farms... the network backbones.. 

they will deplatform these companies, take away their revenue 

what  was that site that happened to... hmmmmm 

Gab .. remember they got shut down

&amp;#x200B;

so the whole social network thing .. with China actually putting people on lists.. europe arresting people and jailing them for what we in the USA would consider free speech.. 

it is only going to get worse by many magnitudes

But then maybe people will take their heads out of their phones and computers and start talking to each other .. that is a possibility maybe .. or maybe people will just continue mindlessly and conform .. thats a bigger and more dangerous possibility. 

&amp;#x200B;

you know most of the time i really don't want to see the NSFW Stuff and I guess people don't like other things like Politics or exposing the corrupt and evil.. but

# Une caricature du « New York Times » déchaîne la tempête en Israël

  Dans un contexte marqué par une recrudescence des actes antisémites,  notamment aux Etats-Unis, le quotidien américain a présenté des excuses.  

&amp;#x200B;

Les Israéliens ont profité de la semaine de Pessah (Pâque juive) pour  se reposer des polémiques incendiaires qui ont émaillé les derniers  mois, jusqu’aux législatives du 9 avril. Ce répit s’est achevé de façon  brutale, le 27 avril.

Dans la matinée aux Etats-Unis, un  homme de 19 ans, John Earnest, a fait irruption dans une synagogue près  de San Diego (Californie) et a ouvert le feu, tuant une personne et en  blessant trois autres.

Au  cours de cette même journée de samedi, les réseaux sociaux israéliens  s’enflammaient en raison d’un simple dessin satirique publié 48 heures  plus tôt par le prestigieux *New York Times* (*NYT*). Un  dessin ni drôle ni pertinent, à la tonalité antisémite incontestable,  ressemblant si peu aux normes du quotidien américain. On y voit Donald  Trump, portant des lunettes noires d’aveugle et une kippa, tiré par un  chien au visage de Benyamin Nétanyahou, avec une étoile de David sur le  collier.

## Erreur et excuses

Au  lieu de se focaliser sur le profil du tueur de San Diego, la latitude  dont disposent les suprémacistes sous la présidence de Donald Trump ou  l’antisémitisme blanc classique et ravageur, la plupart des  commentateurs en Israël ont regardé ailleurs. Ils ont fait assaut de  propos outragés sur le journal américain, très lu parmi les faiseurs  d’opinion et les décideurs de l’Etat hébreu.

On réclama des excuses à la *« Grey lady »* (surnom du *NYT*),  une enquête interne, des sanctions. On s’émut, une nouvelle fois, de la  dérive de la gauche libérale américaine, notamment parmi la diaspora  juive, qui ne saurait maîtriser son zèle, dès lors qu’il s’agirait de  critiquer le gouvernement israélien.

La réaction du quotidien a eu lieu en deux temps. Il a tout d’abord mis en avant une simple [*« erreur de jugement »* ](https://twitter.com/nytopinion/status/1122143162506596354)à l’origine de cette image *« offensante »*. Mais devant le déluge de condamnations, il a décidé, le lendemain, de publier un nouveau communiqué.

Un éditeur du *NYT* sans supervision suffisante serait seul à l’origine de cette publication, dans la version internationale du quotidien*. « Ce genre d’imagerie est toujours dangereuse, à un moment où l’antisémitisme monte dans le monde entier »*, a reconnu la direction, en présentant des excuses.

Le ministre israélien de la sécurité publique, Gilad Erdan, a associé la caricature à la *« propagande nazie pendant l’Holocauste »*.  Habitué aux provocations sur Twitter, avec le silence encourageant de  son père, Yaïr Nétanyahou a pour sa part implicitement mis en cause le  quotidien, comme source d’inspiration du tueur de San Diego. *« Certains  rapports disent que le tireur de la synagogue Chabad disait que Trump  était l’esclave des juifs. Je suis sûr que le dessin dans le* NYT *n’a rien à voir avec cela. »*

## Attaques en règle contre le quotidien

Le 27 avril, encore moins subtil et plus énervé, il écrivait ceci dans un autre message, à l’attention de la rédaction du *NYT* : *« Vous êtes un journal antisémite ! Le* NYT *a délibérément  caché les informations à propos de l’extermination de millions de juifs  en Europe pendant la seconde guerre mondiale ! »*

Ce  même Yaïr Nétanyahou avait publié sur sa page Facebook, en  septembre 2017, un montage aux relents antisémites, semblant indiquer  qu’une conspiration expliquait les problèmes judiciaires de son père.  Une conspiration avec à sa tête le milliardaire philanthrope juif  d’origine hongroise, George Soros.

Le fils du premier ministre n’était pas le seul à remonter le temps dans ses griefs contre le journal. Dans le quotidien pro-Nétanyahou *Israel Hayom*  (qui appartient au magnat américain des casinos Sheldon Adelson), le  journaliste Eldad Beck a appelé, en toute amitié confraternelle, à  l’établissement d’une *« équipe d’enquêteurs indépendants qui examineront la position du* NYT *sur Israël depuis la fin de la seconde guerre mondiale jusqu’à ce jour. »*

L’ambassadeur  israélien à Washington, Ron Dermer, l’un des plus proches conseillers  de Benyamin Nétanyahou, a aussi fait référence à l’affaire dans ses  remarques à l’occasion de la journée du souvenir de l’Holocauste. *« Par une couverture biaisée, des tribunes diffamatoires et des dessins antisémites,* \[les\] *rédacteurs en chef* \[du *NYT*\] *choisissent chaque semaine de façon honteuse de présenter l’Etat juif comme une force du mal »,* a prétendu le diplomate.

## Débordements xénophobes

De son côté, le chef du gouvernement israélien n’a pas souhaité en rajouter contre le quotidien américain*. « La communauté internationale doit intensifier la lutte contre l’antisémitisme »*, a recommandé Benyamin Nétanyahou sur Twitter, en réponse à l’attaque de San Diego.

Le  premier ministre a promis de convoquer cette semaine une réunion  spéciale – on ne sait précisément avec qui – face la recrudescence des  attaques antisémites.

Chaque propos ambigu ou  caricatural de Mahmoud Abbas, le président de l’Autorité palestinienne,  est relevé et dénoncé dans la seconde. En revanche, la vigilance de  « Bibi » semble bien moins forte, sur ce point, lorsque les débordements  xénophobes se produisent parmi ses alliés politiques et leurs  soutiens : Donald Trump, refusant de condamner les suprémacistes blancs  défilant à Charlottesville (Virginie) en août 2017 avec des symboles  nazis, ou bien Viktor Orban, le premier ministre hongrois.

One year, there were a few exchange students from China that visited and one of my friends offered his house as an accommodation for a boy. During his stay, the boy taught my friend's family a few common phrases in chinese. He stumbled across a phrase that my friends used a lot, which was '我爱你', meaning 'I love you' (which they thought was fuck you haha).

I got exposed by that friend in our group chat and after 5 years of teaching them how to 'swear' in Chinese, they finally realised the true meanings.

First of all, some woman at an optician's store is hardly legally or ethically bound, or medically capable for that matter, to give out advice without consulting you. How do you even know she was a medical professional, and not just a tech, or in charge of selling the merchandise in there, in which case she probably just wanted to get you out of her hair, since she couldn't sell you something?

Second, in my experience, dailies and bi-weeklies are rarely exactly the same size and BC, even from the same brand. Some other brand than the one you've been wearing for your bi-weeklies may have dailies that are more suitable for you. This is why you need a consult, during which you can request a fitting with different kinds of contacts. You tell your doctor you want dailies, they give you options and test-run contacts, precisely so you won't have to guess at your own expense, risking to spend more getting packs upon packs of whatever contacts you think might fit, and risking to damage your eyes in the process. 

Look, I get it. I understand. I'm basically paid close to minimum wage in a poor Eastern European country, my contacts are a luxury purchase to me too, a purchase that I have to plan for very carefully, and save for. Which is precisely why I don't go about testing contacts on my own. I can't afford to buy every contact out there that sounds good, and I can't afford to fix any damage to my eyes. Contacts are supposed to feel perfectly comfortable, or they're not a good fit. You're playing fast and loose with your own eyes here.
