It boils down to, the growth only significantly changes if you tax households. Yang's primary funding comes from a VAT tax on corporations.

As long as we can agree that the 12.5 percent growth rate is not applicable in this case.  According to the study, that only happens if you borrow all the money.

With the format you're proposing there would be very little point to the regular season and most teams would be completely slacking off, especially a team like G2 who basically trolls at the moment the second they're guaranteed top 2.

I guess that's because I'm European and a fan of football, but I definitely value consistency over the entire regular season over a playoffs system.

  ""Se a Europa n√£o puder respeitar seus compromissos, o Ir√£ passar√° √† terceira etapa na redu√ß√£o dos compromissos adotados com o JCPOA (sigla em ingl√™s do acordo chamado Plano Integral de A√ß√£o Conjunta)"", disse Rohani a Macron, segundo o portal do governo iraniano.

I mostly agree with Snagalip above: George really did have something special, and maybe thematically it was intact, but what he had was in rough form. He remixed his material many times on the way to processing it into a story. Part of that process involved layering over literal movies (yes Japanese samurai films, though I'm not sure that Hidden Fortress was actually quite as much of an influence as it's usually reported... but definitely The Dam Busters for the WW2 rhythms of the Trench Run). 

His 'marketing copy' did very much change over time, though, and while what he said always 'may have been true from a certain point of view' (I agree that he probably wasn't outright lying, at least in his own mind), it wasn't usually reported as 'George has some rough ideas that have been stewing in his head since a kid' but (and most especially in the Prequel era) 'George has and has always had one very specific and definite plan - quit yer complainin and sit down and just wait for The Plan'. (Where have we heard that one recently?) Problem is, what that definite plan *was* kept changing.

And unfortunately, it was in the Prequel era where George *most* needed the fans who had followed him since 1977 to feel that he was being fully open and honest with them, because his films were very disappointing (MUCH worse than the EU materials coming from his own companies at the same time, including the games) and they were losing trust, and... right when he most needed to be trustworthy, he kinda wasn't. He just kept trying to rewrite history and try to pretend nothing had ever changed. Starting with the Special Editions and never making the original theatrical cuts available. It was just this constant sense, 1997 to 2007, of 'slippery old George, you just can't take him at his word'. And, well. We couldn't. 

(And that's why projects like Secret History appeared, trying to riddle out the TRUTH about how Star Wars was made and whatever happened to that amazing Prequels story he'd supposedly had plotted out forever, because George was NOT giving us the truth. He was giving us Slightly Truth Flavoured Product.)

And Lucasfilm after George, sadly, has kept up that tradition of rewriting history to cast themselves as heroes against a horde of disappointed fans.. but doubled and tripled down on it.

Disney LOVES to complain about how 'Star Wars has the most toxic fan base', but that's because Star Wars has the most *passionate and committed* fan base... and also the worst quality drop in official products compared to fan products. And the fans notice when things that cost billions of dollars are worse than things they make themselves for free.

It did not. 

Objectively so. 

You are completely wrong - there was a Commons majority for Attlee‚Äôs plans but the HoL wanted to delay them. 

The law in place was that the HoL could delay by three sessions over two years, so the prorogation happened in order to create an extra session and reduce the delay that the Lords could cause. 

It did not sideline the HoC. 

&gt; So does Borris.

No, Boris has a Commons majority against his plans which is why he‚Äôs trying to sideline the Commons. Attlee has a Commons majority in favour. In fact arguably Attlee was *strengthening* the power of the Commons by reducing the potential for delay from the Lords. 

&gt; No it's extremely similar. Atlee abused the suspension of parliament to force through his reforms against the political system of the UK. Borris is abusing the suspension of parliament to help prevent parliament stopping Britain leaving the EU on the 31st of October. Just because you hate Brexit doesn't make what Borris did any worse than Atlee

I have quite clearly explained the key differences between them. Attlee did not sideline the Commons in any way shape or form, he merely reduced the potential for delays from the Lords. 

&gt; But it has happened before. And the sky didn't fall in. Unless you're claiming both Atlee and Major led ""coups"" in their own time

[],,LapsarianLiving,,,,[],,,,text,t2_4b7qv83z,False,False,[],"The crusades were a really complicated time for a couple reasons. 

For one, I am a confessional Presbyterian, so we reject the Pope's authority. In fact, anyone who claims to possess an office of papacy, [our doctrinal standards call an ""antichrist""](http://www.reformation21.org/confession/2013/07/chapter-256.php) on the grounds that he functionally serves as a rival to Christ's claim to be head of the church. The middle ages were a time of notorious corruption of the church and one of the main reasons the reformation needed to happen. 

At the same time, the historical situation was really unique. After the fall of the Western Roman empire, the threat of banditry became so severe that Europe descended into feudalism, which meant that there was very little concentration of power outside of the local Lords. There were also a lot of medieval disputes about the relationship between the power of the church and the state. There were debates about whether the state appointed bishops or the church validated the existence of the state. There is even [a forged document called the Donation of Constantine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donation_of_Constantine) where he supposedly gave full civil authority to the Pope. During this time, the Popes filled the power vacuums and called for crusades.

However, you have to understand that the political turmoil in Europe, and the advent of the climate/sanitation/livestock/rat driven plagues that decimated Europe, when Islam came on the scene they had outright religious wars of conquest and were spreading their territory even as far as Spain.  Honestly, when Muslims complain about the Crusades, I really want to whip out my tiny violin to play my song of tiny sympathy, because essentially they got mad that the Pope fought them back.

At the same time, the Crusades were really bad for more reasons than that. For one, they conquered Jerusalem for no apparent reason, when the war was basically against other Christians, the wars themselves fit into the terrible sacramental system they had fabricated where people could be forgiven of sins by going on pilgrimages, touching relics, or going on missions from the Pope.

Yes, but I don't see anyone actually protesting this in the scale people turn out for white nationalism or ""straight pride"" crap. The last time it kind of happened was in the Occupy movement, and even that ended up not doing much of anything. I just don't see the majority of the population being as worked up about COL or wages as socialists claim. (Except maybe on healthcare or college costs, but even then, not that much.)

And the people who are actually producing unrest and protesting are not doing so on economic grounds! All the biggest marches and protests are either for the environment, women's/minority rights, or reactionary bullshit from the other side.

&gt; Many have no choice to live way beyond their means because sprawling suburbs and urban areas designed when oil was cheap and thought to be infinite don't lend themselves to public transit or being healthy communities. Changing this urban nightmare situation most people live in will take something on the scale of a New Deal. 

If what you're selling is ""let's make more public transit and build a ton of housing"", then yeah, I'm all for that. But you're going to have to offset the fiscal expansion needed for all this with *some* thing, or it's going to be massively inflationary (and also polluting since you're not touching carbon costs).

&gt; Read Capital in the 21st Century because I know I'm not going to be able to get you to read anything to the left of that. 

:( for your information, I've read Caliban and the Witch, which was pretty lefty, and one of these days I'll get around to finishing that damn bread book you lot keep insisting on. But okay, that one seems interesting so I will add it to my list.

I have several objections to the following paragraphs you've written, but I will withhold them for now, since I assume that book will get more in-depth about it.

&gt; White people are the loudest and most vitriolic group because they've lost the most by losing privilege. People tend to get more nationalistic and xenophobic when when they feel like their piece of the pie is shrinking. This is really nothing new. 

&gt; The only reason something hasn't snapped already is because we're so efficient at production that a lack of material wealth isn't going to cause people to snap like it did in the path, the contradictions inherent to life under this system and a lack of political agency will. Again, I don't think right-wing populism comes out of a vacuum. 

I mean, I don't either? I think they've been used to being in power for literally millennia, and the end of that is what's making them feel (rightly) threatened. In the past, poor men with few prospects could rely on having a wife to rule over since women were mostly incapable of supporting themselves. That's no longer true, and since they have no one left to oppress they seek to blame others for their own failings.

&gt; Individual blame is a scapegoat. You're assuming people have a choice when they don't. I think you're showing a lot of privilege here by saying such a thing. 

&gt; Most poor people can't afford to be vegetarian, it's far cheaper to buy junk food in bulk at places like Wal-Mart. These same people have to drive because there is no public transit where they live or it takes 2-3x as long which is a deal breaker when you're working 60+ hours a week and trying to raise a family. On top of that, rent and other expenses keep increasing while wages stay the same or decline if we're talking about the US where minimum wage hikes to keep pace with inflation are a political football. 

I'm not blaming individuals. But junk food is cheap because its true costs are hidden and externalized. By forcing people to assume those costs (in food, transport, and elsewhere) there would *have* to be much higher pressure on companies to raise wages, as the current options are priced out and minimum wage doesn't cut it anymore.

(I also think you'd be surprised at how cheap vegetables can be. I'm not talking kale, but more rice, beans and legumes in general. Options that are ignored by poorer consumers because meat and junk food is also cheap and they are culturally conditioned to prefer it.)

&gt; Imagine it's WW2 and people decide to sit back and wait for the free market to build its own army to go liberate their assets in continental Europe. That's what it feels like you're arguing for when you argue against things like the GND for me.

My problem with the GND is that it is sold as an all-encompassing solution but it does not address the issue at its roots. If it had a carbon tax (preferably large enough to offset the increase in consumption) and it was coupled with global-scale action (like pushing a carbon tax at the international level, paying developing countries to build renewables/nuclear instead of coal/gas, etc), then I would be for it.

And I also think that you can't sell the GND to the white working class. They've been utterly captured by right-wing propaganda to a degree where they fight against their own interests (like retraining, or some of the Sanders policy Hillary adopted for the general in 2016).

First of all, not in any single post that I made within this thread I ever said or even implied that what the CBP is doing in denying entry is 'bad'. **None!** In fact I mentioned right away that this isn't anything new, that it has been happening for a long time, which implies the opposite, that I completely understand that they're just doing their job, and it is simply what it is and not something special.

You also neglected to recognize that I mentioned twice in this thread how special circumstances **can** be a good reason for students to go home. If they have a really good reason (wedding of a sibling, some family event, etc.), then of course it's okay, and also for sure if there's an emergency like a dying family members. In these cases, absolutely, you do what you have to do. But for vacationing to Europe for fun or simply feeling homesick, I will (and have) advise them that traveling internationally may not be worth it.

And yes, all the stories I mentioned are anecdotal, but they are also my own personal experiences and experiences of dozens of international students from around the world that I have known personally, for the past 20+ years, a very lengthy period of time which I spent either in or around academia. It bothers me when students can't complete their degree, for any reason. And for it to happen simply because they couldn't enter the country after an unnecessary international vacation, is a really dumb reason. So, of course I'm going to advise young international students the best way to navigate living in the US and the best way for them to spend their break time, without jeopardizing their chance of a degree. I emphasized to them that the fact that they are a student here a privilege, and I don't want them to squander it. I took it as my responsibility to inform them of things I am very familiar with, and this includes discouraging them to travel internationally, unless they really need to.

In Western culture, William Shakespeare ascribed emblematic meanings to flowers, especially in Hamlet, Prince of Denmark.

I do understand this. His ""'American Libertarian'-Socialism"" (my words) requires both a centralized state and private property. That makes him a Libertarian, I agree. Still, Milton Friedman did not invent, or even really advocate for a UBI, he advocated a Negative Income Tax, which is similar, maybe even only different to a pedantic point. Other, more truly revolutionary thinkers, like Paine, advocated for things more akin to a Basic Income, with reasoning that sounds as if it's from a more traditional socialists; from Agrarian Justice, ‚ÄúEquality of natural property is the subject of this little essay. Every individual in the world is born therein with legitimate claims on a certain kind of property, or its equivalent.‚Äù

Which is I guess where the crux is, that subsistence payments are not the equivalent to property rights.

Still, I would argue that a more substantial UBI could adequately fill this void, and complete a sort of ""Painian Socialism""  or ""American Libertarian Socialism"" and I think that getting that UBI in place, declaring ownership over the market economy and beginning the *erosion of capitalism*, would be an excellent advancement of the post-capitalist cause. And, like in that [RICH economy](https://abolishwork.com/2014/01/21/the-rich-economy-by-robert-anton-wilson/) piece, the goal is obviously to *increase the dividend*.

&gt;a UBI isnt less 'tankie statist' than a FJG, socialized medicine, or public housing.

I understand your point here, since it does require a strong state, taxation and the inherent threat of violence, but I think you are dismissive of the relative size difference, which creates the appeal. American Libertarians are not in favor of a FJG or public housing, but are for a UBI. Why? That is a meaningful difference, at least in the current political spectrum.

I like Chomsky's [Pragmatic Utopianism](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/12/lessons-from-chomsky) which dovetails nicely into Wright's Envisioning Real Utopias. I think the opportunity to take a step forward is here, but everyone is looking away because Yang doesn't fit nicely into the box we want for him. He is obviously trying very hard to not be called a socialist, even though he is somehow convincing lots of people that we ""collectively own the market, and are owed a share of its prosperity?""

&gt;you can exclude food and healthcare and still a $1000 ubi barely pays for a months rent, if at all.

C'mon. Depends where you live. There are thousands of 3 bedroom homes you can rent for $1000/month all across middle america, not to mention smaller apartments for much less.  I would love the UBI to be higher too, but even getting it across the finish line at a poverty level would still be a huge win.

&gt;i'm skeptical of what all can be accomplished with this other than folks having a million roommates, a point system for sharing chores, and the maintenance of a small garden that doesn't come close to sustaining everyone.

I'm sure when the first capitalists were starting tiny merchant trading enterprises, they didn't imagine that they'd topple the feudal kings of Europe, they just were trying to support themselves without having to provide exploitative labor to their feudal lords. But better economic models continue to grow and here we are. Worker collectives could have an easier time getting started with a UBI, and could begin to out-compete capitalist companies on the employment market, since if people had more choice, they would choose to own their own labor. Of course it starts small, but once people aren't forced to labor for capitialist jobs, they will be making real, if small, progress towards post-capitalism.

I don't really know much or care about crypto either, but I thought maybe some anarcho-types were for it. Not make or break for me.

Would Yang adopting some sort of wealth tax a la Warren as a partial funding mechanism for his Freedom Dividend make it more palatable? And/or funding it by a more progressive income tax? i believe that the funding structure is important, but not as important as the having the equitable payout, and the funding could be adjusted as we try to raise the dividend.

Honestly my biggest thing is the breakdown of wage labor towards a system of universal rights. That seems huge to me. Crucial to my understanding of libertarian socialism and post-capitialism. And also wondering why the market itself can't be considered the ""means of production"" to be collectively owned?

Also taken from that Chomsky current affairs article:

&gt;The libertarian socialists have always been critical of the more ‚ÄúLeninist‚Äù mindset, which sees social change coming from a ‚Äúvanguard‚Äù of intellectuals who know what‚Äôs best for the people. For the anarchistic socialist, the power to change their lives should be in people‚Äôs *own* hands. Thus writing, even on complicated subjects, should be in as clear language as possible, because it shouldn‚Äôt just be available to academics and people who have had elite educations.

Yang seems to be offering a clear path towards a more equitable and free society, but because he doesn't come from the traditional vanguard, he is scoffed at, his ideas not considered, when to me, (not an academic, just a carpenter who likes to read) they seem to fit into a pattern of ideas that grow out of the Libertarian Socialism landscape, but are adapted for implementation into current American politics in a way that Bakunin or Bookchin just can't be. Where as Bernie, because he has some weak socialist label gets a pass even though his policies reinforce the system of wage labor? and create an even more centralized and powerful state than Yang does? All because Bernie decided to call himself a socialist while making his millions? (I'm sorry, I do actually like Bernie and what he has done for socialism, writ large, but his socialism isn't exactly my cup of tea, as I imagine is true for many in this sub, still, I'd definitely be supporting him if Yang hadn't captured my imagination with his unorthodox political alignment.)

Maybe you're right, and Yang is just a Libertarian, but the Libertarians don't like him either. They call him a socialist and I think they might be right, and I guess that means I'm still just a confused rando on the internet.

I still think this is something new, maybe Neo-Painism?, or ""American Libertarian""-Socialism.

Thanks for taking the time to engage.

 A alcunha adv√©m do fato de que Maia [tem se consolidado como protagonista no cen√°rio pol√≠tico](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/07/maia-e-ovacionado-critica-governo-bolsonaro-e-diz-que-centrao-aprovou-reforma.shtml) ao longo deste ano de governo Jair Bolsonaro (PSL).

 Depois de se firmar como principal articulador pol√≠tico da reforma da Previd√™ncia, [agora em tramita√ß√£o no Senado,](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/08/maia-entrega-previdencia-a-alcolumbre-e-proposta-comeca-a-tramitar-no-senado.shtml) o deputado busca manter a C√¢mara no centro do debate pol√≠tico.

 Conhecido como defensor da agenda econ√¥mica de reformas, que incluem a tribut√°ria e a administrativa, Maia tomou a frente em uma √°rea diferente na √∫ltima semana.

 Em meio √† crise das queimadas,[ pediu em nome da C√¢mara ao ministro do STF (Supremo Tribunal Federal) Alexandre de Moraes ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2019/08/maia-quer-que-dinheiro-de-fundo-da-petrobras-seja-destinado-para-amazonia.shtml)a libera√ß√£o de recursos do fundo da Opera√ß√£o Lava Jato para a√ß√µes na Amaz√¥nia.

 [Criticou a posi√ß√£o de Bolsonaro de rejeitar a ajuda financeira do G7](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2019/08/em-meio-a-crise-bolsonaro-prioriza-ataques-a-reservas-indigenas-em-reuniao-com-governadores-da-amazonia.shtml) (""o Brasil n√£o pode abrir m√£o de nenhum real"") e ao mesmo tempo as declara√ß√µes do presidente franc√™s, Emmanuel Macron, sobre o acordo entre Mercosul e Uni√£o Europeia (""o presidente da Fran√ßa ficou isolado"").

 Al√©m disso, [recebeu um grupo de ex-ministros do Meio Ambiente](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2019/08/ex-ministros-pedem-a-maia-suspensao-de-projetos-prejudiciais-ao-ambiente.shtml) que pleitearam que a Casa se esforce para barrar textos antiambientais.

 Em outros fronts, por exemplo, tem articulado projeto para abrir o futebol brasileiro a investidores estrangeiros, sinalizou que a C√¢mara pode avan√ßar nos [pacotes de seguran√ßa p√∫blica](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/08/apos-derrotas-em-serie-pacote-de-seguranca-vira-teste-de-fogo-para-moro.shtml) elaborados por Alexandre de Moraes e pelo ministro da Justi√ßa, Sergio Moro, e instalou comiss√£o para tratar da abertura do mercado de saneamento para empresas privadas.

 ""Ele assumiu esse espa√ßo porque ele [o espa√ßo] foi deixado pelo governo"", afirmou o deputado Alexandre Frota,[ expulso do PSL ap√≥s cr√≠ticas a ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/08/bolsonaro-nao-e-burro-mas-um-idiota-ingrato-que-nada-sabe-diz-alexandre-frota.shtml)[Bolsonaro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/08/bolsonaro-nao-e-burro-mas-um-idiota-ingrato-que-nada-sabe-diz-alexandre-frota.shtml) e que aderiu ao PSDB do governador paulista, Jo√£o Doria. ""O governo n√£o enviou ningu√©m para conversar, para articular, para criar estrat√©gias, quando encaminhou a Previd√™ncia.""

 Maia disse √† **Folha** na sexta-feira (30) que o modelo de governo de Bolsonaro permite que o Legislativo aja com maior independ√™ncia para tocar agendas pr√≥prias. ""O fim do governo de coaliz√£o, que foi decis√£o do presidente, gerou dois Poderes claros. No governo de coaliz√£o, o Parlamento ficava como subproduto do Executivo"", afirmou.

 Segundo o cientista pol√≠tico e professor da PUC Minas Malco Camargos, a impress√£o de for√ßa incomum do Congresso de 2019 vem, na verdade, do fato de que legislaturas anteriores costumavam ficar a reboque de articula√ß√µes do presidente.

 ""Fala-se que estamos caminhando para um semipresidencialismo, mas na verdade o que est√° acontecendo √© que o Legislativo est√° deixando de ser subserviente e ocupando a sua fun√ß√£o"", diz.

 Se Maia acumulou aliados e poder dentro da Casa (teve, na elei√ß√£o para a presid√™ncia da C√¢mara deste ano, sua maior quantidade de votos dos tr√™s pleitos que disputou), a postura de protagonista n√£o agrada a todos os parlamentares.

 Ele recebe cr√≠ticas principalmente daqueles ligados √†s bases bolsonaristas nas redes sociais. Na quarta-feira (28), depois da reuni√£o com os ex-ministros, a deputada Carla Zambelli (PSL-SP) foi ao Twitter verbalizar insatisfa√ß√£o.

 ""Maia quer sinalizar que o Parlamento 'seja um instrumento de equil√≠brio neste processo de desenvolvimento, sem deixar de lado o Meio Ambiente'. Como falei no meu discurso de domingo na [avenida] Paulista: o Executivo √© com Jair Bolsonaro. E parece que o parlamentarismo √© apoiado aqui'"", escreveu.

 Parte das cr√≠ticas pode ser explicada por um antagonismo que se criou entre o mandat√°rio da C√¢mara e o do Planalto no primeiro semestre e que virou a base do presidente contra Maia.

 A troca de farpas chegou ao ponto de Bolsonaro dizer que [Maia era como uma namorada que quer ir embora](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/03/bolsonaro-compara-maia-a-namora-que-quer-ir-embora.shtml). Sobrou tamb√©m para Sergio Moro, que teve seu projeto anticrime [chamado pelo deputado de ""copia e cola""](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/03/maia-diz-que-projeto-de-moro-e-copia-e-cola-e-que-ministro-confunde-as-bolas.shtml) do texto do ministro do Supremo Alexandre de Moraes.

 O pr√≥prio Frota chegou a ser escalado, quando ainda estava no PSL, para ajudar no restabelecimento de rela√ß√µes entre membros do governo e o presidente da C√¢mara na √©poca da Previd√™ncia.

 No segundo semestre, o clima segue mais ameno. Embora tenha procurado se distanciar das falas de Bolsonaro nas quest√µes ambientais, Maia foi cuidadoso ao expor as cr√≠ticas. Disse em diversas vezes que, embora as palavras ""radicais"" do presidente possam passar uma ideia equivocada, o governo n√£o adotou a√ß√µes que facilitassem queimadas.

 Para o presidente da C√¢mara, o relacionamento mudou de ambos os lados. ""Eu acho que, do ponto de vista da rela√ß√£o do governo com a pol√≠tica, teve uma mudan√ßa. Acho que teve tamb√©m uma compreens√£o [dos deputados] do estilo do presidente e que n√£o dever√≠amos cumprir o papel de necessariamente polemizar em todos os conflitos"", disse. ""J√° que muitas vezes isso n√£o leva a nada, era melhor deixar o presidente falar.""

 O professor da PUC Minas avalia que a mudan√ßa de atitude do governo veio por causa do sucesso que a reforma da Previd√™ncia obteve na C√¢mara.

 ""Como h√° a aus√™ncia do poder articulador do presidente, o pr√≥prio Executivo percebeu que o Maia tem prestado esse servi√ßo no Congresso, e passou a enxerg√°-lo n√£o como advers√°rio, mas como aliado"", disse.

 ""O curioso √© que √© um aliado que vai ganhando protagonismo, e n√£o subservi√™ncia.""

 Na segunda-feira (26), [uma not√≠cia negativa relacionada a Maia ajudou a derrubar a Bolsa](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/08/dolar-bolsa-risco-pais-e-juros-voltam-a-patamar-anterior-a-aprovacao-da-previdencia.shtml) e a elevar o d√≥lar. A Pol√≠cia Federal havia atribu√≠do a ele os crimes de corrup√ß√£o passiva, falsidade ideol√≥gica eleitoral (caixa dois) e lavagem de dinheiro ao concluir inqu√©rito sobre supostos repasses da Odebrecht ao deputado.

 As redes sociais pegaram fogo. ""Rodrigo Maia √© o primeiro-ministro imagin√°rio do pa√≠s imagin√°rio do centr√£o"", escreveu um usu√°rio. ""Rodrigo 'Botafogo' Maia, tua casa vai cair!"", postou outro, em refer√™ncia ao apelido atribu√≠do ao pol√≠tico na lista de supostos repasses da Odebrecht.

 Na ter√ßa (27), por√©m, o clima no Congresso era de normalidade. Maia negou as acusa√ß√µes ao chegar √† Casa, e o dia transcorreu sem que o assunto fosse o centro do debate.

 Para o cientista pol√≠tico, a menos que existam fatos novos, as acusa√ß√µes contra Maia n√£o s√£o suficientes para abalar o apoio que ele possui entre seus pares.

 ""Acho que ele e o pr√≥prio Bolsonaro j√° entenderam que essas cr√≠ticas n√£o abalam o funcionamento da pol√≠tica hoje em dia. Independentemente do volume de cr√≠ticas que voc√™ recebe, se voc√™ tem um conjunto de atores que encampam o seu discurso, isso faz valer a sua vontade"", afirma Camargos.

Because they are all money launders or use money laundering on a global scale.

I have thousands of hours in eso (hence the username here) and i like(d) the game, but it has so many performance-issues, it's unbelievable. PC EU has seen some crazy stuff over the last months, everything from random disconnects for whole raidgroups in PVE which reset the instance, mobs bugged so hard that it causes wipes, dungeon tool not working (even with a premade group from zonechat you just can't port into a dungeon...), PvP at primetime is just unplayable unless you enjoy a slideshow of 2 fps.. And the latest patch is a kick in the face to endgame-players, dumbing down class identity and making raid-combat mindnumbingly dull. Last point was the last straw for me, and i am what you'd call a hardcore-pve-raider over there. I cannot recommend ESO to anyone at the moment, first they need to get their shit together and fix their servers.

Combat-wise, eso is a lot faster than WoW classic, in classic it is very difficult for me getting used to all those long casttimes and cooldowns.  
Still, I really really love WoW classic so far, i haven't had this much fun in a game for a VERY long time! It is just SO MUCH FUN. Currently level 22, doing quests with my partner (who also came from ESO) and we even have done our first dungeon. Both of us had never played WoW before but are totally hooked already, this weekend was madness. Hectic food-preparations for the whole day during the morning queue and whatnot.

Almost certainly, the answer is that those who spend their lives studying ancient Egypt have no reason to know much about medieval Muslim history. But this means they do not realize that the Arab chronicles they cite are collections of legends and traditions needing interpretation. Indeed, the earliest, written by the generally reliable al-Mas‚Äôudi and dating to no earlier than c. 950, does not even mention Ma‚Äômun as the caliph who visited Giza. Al-Mas‚Äôudi attributes the breaching of the pyramid to Ma‚Äômun‚Äôs father, Haroun al-Rashid, a ruler best remembered as the caliph of the Thousand and One Nights‚Äîand he appears in a distinctly fabulous context. When, the chronicler writes, after weeks of labor Haroun‚Äôs men finally forced their way in, they:

&gt;found a vessel filled with a thousand coins of the finest gold, each of which was a dinar in weight. When Haroun al-Rashid saw the gold, he ordered that the expenses he incurred should be calculated, and the amount was found exactly equal to the treasure which was discovered.

It should be stated here that least one apparently straightforward account of Ma‚Äômun‚Äôs doings does survive; Al-Idrisi, writing in 1150, says that the caliph‚Äôs men uncovered both ascending and descending passages, plus a vault containing a sarcophagus which, when opened, proved to contain ancient human remains. But other chroniclers of the same period tell different and more fantastical tales. One, Abu Hamid, the Andalusian author of the Tuhfat al Albab, insists that he himself entered the Great Pyramid, yet goes on to talk of several large ‚Äúapartments‚Äù containing bodies ‚Äúenveloped in many wrappers, that had become black through length of time,‚Äù and then insists that

&gt;those who went up there in the time of Ma‚Äômun came to a small passage, containing the image of a man in green stone, which was taken out for examination before the Caliph; when it was opened a human body was discovered in golden armor, decorated with precious stones, and in his hand was a sword of inestimable value, and above his head a ruby the size of an egg, which shone like fire.

What, though, of the earliest accounts of the tunnel dug into the pyramid? Here the most influential writers are two other Muslim chroniclers, Abd al-Latif (c.1220) and the renowned world traveler Ibn Battuta (c.1360). Both men report that Ma‚Äômun ordered his men to break into Khufu‚Äôs monument using fire and sharpened iron stakes‚Äîfirst the stones of the pyramid were heated, then cooled with vinegar, and, as cracks appeared in them, hacked to pieces using sharpened iron staves. Ibn Battuta adds that a battering ram was used to smash open a passage.

Nothing in either of these accounts seems implausible, and the Great Pyramid does indeed bear the scar of a narrow passage that has been hacked into its limestone and which is generally supposed to have been excavated by Ma‚Äômun. The forced passage is located fairly logically, too, right in the middle of the north face, a little below and a little to the right of the real (but then concealed) entrance, which the cunning Egyptians of Khufu‚Äôs day had placed 24 feet off center in an attempt to out-think would-be tomb robbers. Yet the fact remains that the Arab versions were written 400 to 500 years after Ma‚Äômun‚Äôs time; to expect them to be accurate summaries of what took place in the ninth century is the equivalent of asking today‚Äôs casual visitor to Virginia to come up with a credible account of the lost colony of Roanoke. And on top of that, neither Abd al-Latif nor Ibn Battuta says anything about how Ma‚Äômun decided where to dig, or mentions the story of the falling capstone guiding the exhausted tunnelers.

Given all this, it is legitimate to ask why anyone believes it was Ma‚Äômun who entered the Great Pyramid, and to wonder how the capstone story entered circulation. The answer sometimes advanced to the first question is that there is a solitary account that dates, supposedly, to the 820s and so corroborates Arab tradition. This is an old Syriac fragment (first mentioned in this context in 1802 by a French writer named Silvestre de Sacy) which relates that the Christian patriarch Dionysius Telmahrensis accompanied Ma‚Äômun to the pyramids and described the excavation that the caliph made there. Yet this version of events, too, turns out to date to hundreds of years later. It appears not in the chronicle that De Sacy thought was written by Dionysius (and which we now know was completed years before Ma‚Äômun‚Äôs time, in 775-6 A.D., and composed by someone else entirely), but in the 13th century Chronicon Ecclesiasticum of Bar-Hebraeus. This author, another Syrian bishop, incorporates passages of his predecessor‚Äôs writings, but there is no way of establishing whether they are genuine. To make matters worse, the scrap relating to the pyramids says only that Dionysius looked into ‚Äúan opening‚Äù in one of the three monuments of Giza‚Äîwhich might or might not have been a passage in the Great Pyramid, and might or might not have excavated by Ma‚Äômun. This realization takes us no closer to knowing whether the caliph really was responsible for opening the pyramid, and leaves us as dependent on late date Arab sources as we were before.

As for the story of the falling capstone‚Äìthat remains an enigma. A concerted hunt reveals that it first made print in the middle of the 19th century, published by Charles Piazzi Smyth. But Smyth does not say where he found it. There are hints, which I still hope to run to ground some day, that it may have made its first appearance in the voluminous works of a Muslim scientist, Abu Salt al-Andalusi. Abu Salt likewise traveled in Egypt. Very intriguingly, he picked up much of his information while held under house arrest in an ancient library in Alexandria.

The problem, though, is this: even if Smyth got his story from Abu Salt, and even if Abu Salt was scrupulous, the Muslim chronicler was writing not in the 820s but in the 12th century. (He was imprisoned in Egypt in 1107-11.) So while there may still be an outside chance that the account of the falling capstone is based on some older, now lost source, we certainly can‚Äôt say that for certain. It may be equally likely that the story is a pure invention.

You see, the forced entry that has been driven into the pyramid is just a little too good to be true. Put it this way: perhaps the question that we should be asking is how a passage dug apparently at random in a structure the size of the Great Pyramid emerges at the exact spot where the Descending and the Ascending Passages meet, and where the secrets of the upper reaches of the pyramid are at their most exposed.

Coincidence? I just don‚Äôt think so. More likely someone, somewhere, sometime knew precisely where to dig. Which would mean the chances are that ‚ÄúMa‚Äômun‚Äôs passage‚Äù was hacked out centuries before the Muslims came to Egypt, if only to be choked with rubble and forgotten‚Äîperhaps even in dynastic times. And that, in turn, means something else: that Khufu‚Äôs greatest mystery was never quite as secret as he‚Äôd hoped.

We know what factors influenced this - some of them you think are more important than others?**

Believing in the durability of alliances is one thing, but probably more important to me is the combination of two factors: the ignorance of the disproportion of forces and the influence of pre-war propaganda, lined with a certain superpower ambition.

I can partially understand this optimism. Let's look at it this way: Poland won its independence, in spite of many obstacles, set its own borders, first of all: it defeated the Bolsheviks, being in much weaker positions than in 1939. At the end of the 1930s, Poland has the fifth largest army in the world and it is certainly not as primitive as the German propaganda will later present it.

**Let's go back to the power imbalance.**

The difference in numbers does not reflect the German advantage. The Polish army faced the most technologically advanced army in the world at that time. It had no chance in such a clash.

**The defense war was lost even before it started?**

My answer is this: the most important mistakes or omissions were made long before September. We must be aware that the difference in economic potential was the deciding factor - the expenditure of the Second Polish Republic on armaments was a fraction of what the Third Reich could afford.

However, it is also about differences in consciousness. There was insufficient awareness in Poland of how the armoured forces and the general mechanization of the army would change the war. France, Great Britain and Germany realized this at the end of World War I on the western front. In the interwar period in each of these countries the development of armoured weapons had its own influential spokesman.

**And in Poland?**

The Poles did not learn such a lesson, and from the lesson they could learn - the war with the Bolsheviks - they came to the wrong conclusion. The cavalry, which triumphed then, gained a very prestigious position not only in the army, but also in society in general. This was one of the factors blocking the mechanization of the Polish army, regardless of the financial possibilities of the state.

This does not mean, in any case, that in September the Polish army did everything in its power to exploit its potential. Probably the most important obstacle was the problems with communication. They were intensified by the pace of the German attack, but they came mainly from the culture of military secrecy: even armies or units close to each other could not communicate without the mediation of the Supreme Command.

German commanders were expected to take initiatives, be flexible and react to the changing situation on their own - Polish commanders had their hands tied.

**In this book, you're dispeling a few myths that are still coming back to us today. Let's take the blitzkrieg.**

In 1939, the blitzkrieg doctrine was neither refined nor applied as widely as it is often believed. It happened, for example, that armoured units found themselves 25-30 km behind Polish lines, isolated from the rest of the units. This of course does not change the fact that the German army surpassed Poles with mobility.

I am cautious about the blitzkrieg story as early as September, also because the greatest amount of information about it could be learned from Nazi propaganda at that time. By the way, in the West it was too often taken for a good coin. Meanwhile, the story of the blitzkrieg was then used, among other things, to instil conviction that the well-armed and motorized German army had crushed the army of the last century, which was coupled with the the thesis of the racial superiority of the Germans. The legend about the charge of the Polish cavalry against tanks was also included in it.

**What did the parties involved learn from the September campaign?**

The Reich was definitely driven by it - it was a huge impulse for the Wehrmacht, the Germans strengthened their sense of racial, military and civilisational superiority. The army realized that the blitzkrieg was the right direction to take - and indeed this doctrine was supposed to determine the German successes in 1940-41.

The Western Allies didn't understand much. It was convenient for them to assume that the Polish defeat was decided only by Polish weaknesses, and at the same time they were convinced - again: imperial superiority - that they would do better with Hitler. The reality quickly verified this - with France, which in autumn 1939 had the second largest army in the world and a tank much better than German models, it took 6 weeks for Germans to conquer them. That is, approximately as much as the September campaign lasted.

Stalin did not so much draw conclusions, as he managed to put the chess pieces on the chessboard again. In the short term, the USSR received a very favourable trade agreement with the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the consequences of which we know very well. Most importantly, however, Hitler allowed Stalin to present himself as a destructor of the European status quo. It was a desirable situation for the USSR: to make the imperialists fight each other, and to take on a neutral role, even if only apparently. The Bolsheviks came to power as a result of the upheavals caused by one war and Stalin hoped that another shock - military, social and economic - would allow the Soviets to dominate the whole of Europe.

**The struggle of the Polish September 1939 is a campaign in which the previous war meets the modern. Do you agree?**

Totally. The fighting sides use cavalry - incidentally, Germans have more of it than Poles - and armoured trains, i.e. means commonly used in the Polish-Soviet War. At the same time, what is happening in September'39 in Poland, announces under what conditions this war will take place: armoured weapon attacks, air war, intentional murdering of civilians...

I knew about the war crimes committed by the Germans in Poland, but I must admit that, after exploring the subject, I was surprised: by the scale, brutality, how easy it was to push people to kill, providing them with ideological motivation. Not even for a moment should we forget that when the Germans were fighting a racial war on the occupied territories, the Soviets in the east were fighting no less brutal class war.

It is very important for me that the knowledge about German crimes during the invasion of Poland should be included in the mainstream of Western memory of the war. I often deal with the conviction that the Germans brutalized themselves during the war gradually - this is half true, and it is due to the fact that relatively easily accessible German sources and publications were trusted too often. Since e.g. the French campaign in comparison to others in this war was considered to be carried out almost chivalrously, this means that ""earlier probably also could not be so scary"".

No, not at all. The brutal racial war began with the attack on Poland. The announcement of a mass crime was in this from the very beginning.",True,False,False,,,0,1567329853,,False,0,{},eyq7slf,True,t3_cy7w76,False,True,t1_eyq7s2s,/r/europe/comments/cy7w76/roger_moorhouse_the_allies_did_not_leave_poland/eyq7slf/,False,,1575917155,1,True,[],False,europe,t5_2qh4j,r/europe,public,0,

I have never said anything about Syria and let me tell you something, 90% of people in Turkey are aggressively against what the government is doing in Syria and the fact that I do know pkk is a terrorist organization doesn‚Äôt mean I approve everything the Turkish government have done about this issue.

We're talking about terrorist activity here? You linked to PKK supposedly setting fires in Izmir. I think there are more pressing issues and crimes being committed that I raised and something you should be concerned about, but based on your comment you're aware of it I guess and don't support which it. Fine.

Terror is terror. Turkey has a hand in it as we speak as of today, that's my point, while the PKK is not. Say it how it is. There was a past in which the PKK was committing crimes and there is evidence of this, however during that time Turkey was activity committing state crimes, today it is still doing such actives, which amounts to terror either way. If you are against it, I have nothing negative to say, I am not here to argue with someone being against it terrorist activity.

&gt;Secondly, your best argument about tons of countries recognizing the terrorism are doing it just because they are business and military partners with Turkey. EU is the biggest business partner yet they during Turkey-Armenia dispute they sided with Armenia. They also supported Cyprus during the Cypriot dispute even though Cyprus was not a part of either EU nor Nato at the time.

My best argument is a strong argument. What you're talking isn't accurate. Turkey-Armenia dispute has meant that a lot of countries, like the United States doesn't admit that Turkey committed genocide. Same as in Europe. It is only when they get pissed off and want to piss off Turkey do they start to admit it. Look at France for example, very recently admitted the genocide, after all the years of same evidence. They definitely do not side with Armenia. This is easy politics to understand.

With regards to Cyprus, that's not necessarily true. Cyprus and Greece are EU members and you can see the pattern of agreement reflecting that.. Even the US sided with Cyprus, because it's annexing land, which they do not want Turkey to do. It's massive differences.

&gt;And you actually think Kazakhstan is doing that because of Nato, like, wtf? Kazakhstan is not a global partner of nato [https://www.nato.int/cps/ra/natohq/topics\_49188.htm](https://www.nato.int/cps/ra/natohq/topics_49188.htm) and did you actually researched Kazakhstan?

[https://astanatimes.com/2015/02/steppe-eagle-2015-multinational-peacekeeping-exercises-held-april-june/](https://astanatimes.com/2015/02/steppe-eagle-2015-multinational-peacekeeping-exercises-held-april-june/) Kazakhstan is a bitch country and is playing as much politics as it can, but funny how you focused on that.. That turned out bad for you, didn't it? Be honest.

&gt;And you just said I am extremely biased, bigoted nationalistic and arrogant while one of your threads is literally ‚ÄúWhy I despise Turkey‚Äù. Can you please link 1 posts or comment that I said anything bad about the kurdish people?

Called their biggest resistance group terrorists. What other group is there that represents them in Turkey? They're all attacked. Everyone is PKK so calling them terrorists is an attack on Kurds.

&gt;And if you think I am voting my own posts with 30+ accounts, do the experiment I just mentioned. Just create another account so I won‚Äôt be able to see tour comment, write ‚Äúpkk is not terrorists‚Äù on literally any mainstream subreddit, [r/europe](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/), [r/politics](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/) or even [r/funny](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/). When you glorify terrorism, people downvote it, it‚Äôs that simple.

I always say it? Wtf are you on about? Why would I need another account to state this? I don't get downvoted, only when there is an influx of turkish accounts or I come across a turk who spreads it within their nationalistic channels do I suddenly get a spam of downvotes. It's too obvious, we're not dumb.

&gt;And it‚Äôs so funny that you are the one accusing me of this because you literally quite obviously upvoted your comment with an alt account. Oh forget about the experiment you will probably create 50 account just because of butthurtness.

Because

You have a post

The crux of all this for me though is that I think parliament are very good at ruling things out but not so good at deciding what they might actually accept Brexit-wise - as the indicative votes show. We cannot just extend, delay, and faff about with Brexit forever. At some point it will come to a conclusion. If parliament (or the May-Labour talks) had of agreed a position then the government would have had a mandate to try and deliver it. As it is, there is no guidance from parliament about what deal it might accept, so no chance of a deal being passed; as in my opinion the opposition benches will vote down any deal the government brings (I believe Sturgeon has said as much).   
So in lieu of a deal, and with the vote still not being implemented, it is not surprising we have ended up heading towards no deal due to the conditions of article 50 (which parliament overwhelmingly voted for).  
Really I would prefer the opposition had an actual plan to get us out of the current mess rather than just 'stopping no deal'. 

Also lets not rule out the EU saying no at some point, or imposing some sort of condition the UK might not like on an extension.

There‚Äôs plenty of evidence to suggest it‚Äôs culturally conditioned. You can ask a musicologist or r/musictheory thread why 4/4 is supposedly ‚Äònatural‚Äô and you‚Äôll be met with a myriad of examples that go against the assumed premise of the question. You‚Äôre likely referring to the time sigs of those other cultures as ‚Äústrange‚Äù because you‚Äôre speaking from a western perspective. To those cultures, those times are very natural, and it‚Äôs not just for ‚Äútrance-like‚Äù purposes. There‚Äôs many non-western musical cultures and non-western folk music other than those in asymmetrical meters. It wasn‚Äôt even always the case for western music itself temporally speaking. Before the 20th century, European dance music was in 3/4, such as waltzes. In fact, 3/4 would be considered the ‚Äòideal‚Äô meter in most circa Renaissance era music as it coincided with the Holy Trinity. Gregorian chant, a musical tradition of the western world, had meters that would be unrecognizable to a modern ear raised on 4/4 (in some cases, there was no meters at all).  Actually most music before the 20th century wasn‚Äôt based solely in 4/4. With the aforementioned examples, and others like Greece, Balkan music, Bulgarian music, Latin music, etc. 

It‚Äôs a more modern trend, largely informed by the influence of Blues, Rock ‚Äòn‚Äô Roll, and R&amp;B, which owes its roots to Jazz, and 40-50-60 years where it dominates pop music (in one region of the world) pales in comparison to 1000s where it wasn‚Äôt even always the case. There‚Äôs a video by a YouTuber named Adam Neely named ‚ÄúScotch Snaps‚Äù that makes strong arguments that the way you speak language heavily influences the music you make, listen to, and/or by extension how your general culture inherits it (also see 12Tone‚Äôs ‚ÄúIs Music really a Universal Language‚Äù for similar topics). To say something is ‚Äúuniversal‚Äù is to say it is true everywhere, absolutely for all time, and this is historically not the case. So it begs the question, how is 4/4 universal if there are other cultures that reach different conclusions regarding ‚Äòfeel‚Äô without the influence of modern western sensibilities? 7/8 would feel just as ‚Äònatural‚Äô if we based our cultures‚Äô music around it.


‚ÄúThe giants were on another level, and could think of anything and write it down.‚Äù I know that your knowledge of classical music is limited, but I say this as someone that was raised on rock music and had a mentality similar to yours, until  later in life when I went to learn about it more and researched the history of music. Hearing music in your head and learning to write it down from scratch, is actually a pretty common practice and exercise within classically minded musicians. Plus, we didn‚Äôt know them. We don‚Äôt know the hardships or hurdles they had to overcome in order to develop themselves to the level they got to. There are outliers, sure, but ‚Äònatural talent‚Äô only gets you so far. Debussy didn‚Äôt compose ‚ÄúLa Mer‚Äù when he was 4 years old. He did it when he had a long life of experience and training. Learning to better write the music you want to and be the best musician you can be is more worthwhile than trying to be the next Mozart. From a personal point of view, I just reject the ‚Äòmystery‚Äô argument in general, as not only is it a nebulous assertion that borders on meaningless to be helpful (like, it‚Äôs just as meaningful as asking ‚Äòwell why does anything work?‚Äô), but it can easily be used as an excuse to not grow, or improve because you don‚Äôt ‚Äògot it.‚Äô It appeals to an absolute standard, and assumes music exists in a vacuum, which it simply just doesn‚Äôt.",True,False,False,,,0,1567337953,,False,0,{},eyqcy4q,False,t3_cxc3sz,False,True,t1_eyo9zhx,/r/Music/comments/cxc3sz/tools_latest_album_fear_inoculum_now_available_on/eyqcy4q/,False,,1575919600,2,True,[],False,Music,t5_2qh1u,r/Music,public,0,

Operation Yellowhammer: leaked files reveal medicines that will run out first

An inability to stockpile drugs for many serious illnesses mean shortages will hit patients hard, according to doctors

Senior doctors have warned the NHS to brace itself for the ‚Äúbiggest threat it has ever faced‚Äù if the UK crashes out of the EU on October 31, as a leaked internal document reveals the risks to patients from expected drug shortages.

Confidential files from NHS England, seen by The Sunday Times, list medicines that have been impossible to stockpile, including for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, epilepsy and the chronic pain condition trigeminal neuralgia.

The documents, which show the drugs categorised according to the expected impact of shortages, also set out suggested measures for combating supply problems including flying the drugs in.

Last month the leak of the government‚Äôs Operation Yellowhammer document
laid bare the gaps in its planning for a no-deal Brexit. The Yellowhammer file, which was dated early August, stated that supply chains for medicines were ‚Äúparticularly vulnerable‚Äù to border delays. About three-quarters of medicines enter the UK via the main Channel crossings.

A senior Whitehall source, who is familiar with an earlier version of the Yellowhammer document
, said the government‚Äôs fears around the supply of drugs had grown since March 31, the original date for departing from the EU.

‚ÄúI was quite startled that this appears still to be a serious concern,‚Äù the source said. ‚ÄúBack in March ministers were reasonably satisfied that medicines were going to be OK. It‚Äôs now looking like that confidence has diminished.‚Äù

In June the government outlined plans to secure freight capacity to bring medicines from the Continent in the event of no-deal. The Sunday Times understands that the army could bring in drugs under one worst-case scenario plan. However, senior medics expressed fears that such a move would be insufficient.

Dr Sarah Wollaston, the Liberal Democrat MP and chair of the health select committee, said: ‚ÄúEvery year the NHS has one or two product lines where there are supply chain issues. What‚Äôs different with a no-deal Brexit is it will happen on a much greater scale, for many products at the same time, and at the start of the busiest period for the NHS.‚Äù

The leaked NHS England documents shine a spotlight on how hundreds of treatments are likely to be prioritised in the event of shortages following a no-deal.

In January the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) contacted the royal colleges seeking expert views as part of its planning. About two months later doctors who had volunteered for these unpaid roles were sent files ‚Äî marked ‚Äúofficial sensitive‚Äù ‚Äî and asked to categorise drugs that could not be stockpiled.

A traffic-light system was used. ‚ÄúRed‚Äù meant a shortage would have a ‚Äúsignificant impact on [the] patient and healthcare system‚Äù and affect ‚Äúclinical outcomes‚Äù, which could include survival rates. ‚ÄúAmber‚Äù meant ‚Äúsome impact‚Äù and ‚Äúgreen‚Äù meant no effect on the patient. This system was intended to be used to prioritise drugs to be brought in.

The files, which cover 20 treatments, relate to neurology, mental health and pain relief, and are dated from March. It is understood that the royal colleges have not yet been approached to update these documents before October 31.

Dr David Nicholl, a consultant neurologist in Birmingham, was one of two doctors asked to categorise the treatments in March. He has since become a whistleblower, arguing that this information ‚Äúshould not be kept confidential‚Äù and raising concerns about the impact of a no-deal Brexit on patients.

‚ÄúWithout a clear and transparent mitigation plan that has been fully tested, the NHS faces the biggest threat it has ever faced and patients will come to harm as a result,‚Äù he said.

Professor Andrew Goddard, president of the Royal College of Physicians, said he was ‚Äúvery worried‚Äù about the supply of medicines and items such as implants and prosthetics.

‚ÄúThe NHS is bending over backwards to try to get as ready as it can, but the system is very vulnerable,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf something really bad happened ‚Äî like problems at the EU-UK border ‚Äî it can become a big issue very quickly.‚Äù

He criticised what he called a lack of honesty in the government‚Äôs approach. ‚ÄúWhat frustrates me as a clinician is the rhetoric that ‚Äòno one will go short of medicines or come to any harm‚Äô,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen I discuss a treatment with a patient, I talk about the risks and benefits and warn of the side effects. We‚Äôre not being honest as a country with the public about the potential risks of a no-deal Brexit when it comes to medicines.‚Äù

The government said: ‚ÄúAs part of a responsible government, the department [DHSC] is doing everything appropriate to prepare for Brexit. We want to reassure patients that we should be fully prepared for leaving on October 31, whatever the circumstances.

‚ÄúWe are taking all appropriate steps, meaning our plans should ensure the supply of medicines and medical products remains uninterrupted when we leave the EU.‚Äù

I understand your reasoning about growing, but no reason to give people low strenggt potency weed when everyone knows we could grow high potency strains. Its disappointing, all talks about openess and drying out the black market - when you provide people only 5 or 10% weed, it is simply not competitive to the black market ( and thus it could stay illegal, because what sense is then behind legalization).

Regulation yes, but when i hear Schneider calling it a success  that 40% of smokers buying illegal MONTHS after legalization in Kanada, its a bit of a joke.
Another thing that REALLY enfuriates me is the fixed price of 9‚Ç¨/g, that means we will probably not choose between different strains ( thats really dumb, even the worst coffeeshop has more choices - thats how you mess up legalization ). Im perhaps too pessimistic, were already having lots of cbd strains too choose.

I believe more and more its more about the money and nothing else if they give us one fixed strain of 10% too choose.

The issue is, that eventually we will need to have a trade deal with the EU, and they know it.  This means that all No-Deal does is put us in a much weaker position for the future negotiation because we wilfully inflicted chaos on the global economy.

The only way No-Deal can work as a threat is if it becomes Never-Deal.  If the EU thought that we would leave, and unless there was a deal in place, we would refuse to trade on anything other than WTO terms for at least a generation and we would expel all EU nationals essentially immediately, then they would probably move their positions.  But there is no real talk of that happening.  In other words, for No-Deal to be a legitimate threat to move positions, it has to be a full scorched earth threat. 

The core problem is that the Leavers kept promising unicorns that can't happen, because if they did, it would show other countries that they are actually better off out than in.  This is the main message of the Leave campaign, that we can actually have all the perks of being in the EU, with none of the burdens.  If the EU did ANYTHING that made this seem to be possible, all of the other countries that have flirted with leaving will start to move towards the exits.  Right now, the reason that they aren't is specifically because they see how badly the UK is being screwed by leaving, both by the EU, and by internal divisions.  

I'm also a remainer, but the best way to have gotten a good deal would be first to address the reasons why people wanted to leave, try to negotiate a better relationship inside, and then if that couldn't be achieved, get an internal consensus of that would make the majority of British citizens happy, and take that to Brussels.   As long as Brussels see as disunited country, which they will always be on No-Deal because of how bad it really will be, they aren't going to move.

That's two years of currency flight, of businesses relocating, of it being very difficult for people in Scotland to take out a mortgage or borrow to invest.

Japan could expand because their main rival was China and not another european power until Russia came along. However european powers failed to colonise Korea also, so Japan could claim Korea. And Russia was a different opponent than Britain or France would have been.  

Siam would have to compete with the Dutch East Indies, French Indochina and British Malaysia. So they'd need to expand in these regions before they're claimed by european powers or they would need to go into direct confrontation with them.  

The French involvement in Indochina began early with missionary work and militarily in the early 1800s, but their main effort began in the 1850s, with the protectorate was founded in 1887. 
British involvement also began in the early 1800s, British Malaya was founded in 1826. 
The dutch East Indies began even earlier. [Here is an overview over the dutch expansion](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Dutch_East_Indies_Expansion.gif). In the 1860s they already had controll over large parts of Indonesia. 

So compare that to Japan. 1854 Commodore Perry arrived in Japan. The Boshin War was fought in 1868-69. The first Sino-Japanese War happened in 1894-95, thereafter the annexation of Taiwan. Korea became *independent* in 1897 too and was annexed in 1910. Before that there was a failed american intervention in Korea in 1871.  

So whats the conclusion of this. Japan had more time to industrialise and could expand into a power vacuum. To be successful, Siam has to begin its ambitions in the early 1800s and seek to modernise and also to industrialise. In that it needs definitely european allies to do so, also perhaps to avoid having a european coalition of britich, french and dutch against them.  
As for the French, Siam would need to be more inclusive to christian missionaries. Which might be problematic for the buddhist monarchy. Perhaps the Dutch and British could be better allies.  

If successful, Siam might end up controlling parts of the Malay Peninsuly. Perhaps also several islands on the indonesian archipelago. If they oppose France with the help of the British, they might expand further into Cambodia and Laos, perhaps even Burma and southern China. Spain was declining at that time also, perhaps Siam could colonise the Phillippines also.   

In the long run they might end up as allies to Japan, which would definitely strengthen them since it would give them powerful ally and a stronger base in SEA, with access to Oil in Indonesia. 
Ultimately Japan would therefore have also a stronger starting point in the second World War. 

However ultimately Siam would be under far more pressure earlier than Japan was.

&gt;any thoughts on the North Sea?

I think that dividing the union in such a way is a terrible idea. But I voted to remain, which would completely avoid having to do that. Why do you not hold leavers accountable for not warning you that this would be a possible outcome?

&gt;What about the 'stop brexit' ass wipe lending credence to the idea that 'remaining' is still an option? Does he have a job? I doubt it. He must be supporting himself from donations. Protesting is one thing, but taking money to influence the nations views is surely fraudulent.

This is called lobbying, and rightly or wrongly is a fundamental part of our political system. Again it is your responsibility to be aware of this, I can't help you if you haven't bothered to help yourself. Do you have the same opinion of people like Aaron Banks, an unelected businessman who funnelled millions of pounds into the leave campaign to influence the nation's views?

&gt;What about the Irish issue? A bunch of Irishmen made a special pact to stop bombing each other over a pathetic religious dispute, now it has been taken as an issue front-and-centre to the 'brexit' debate. 

We made a sovereign commitment to never reintroduce border checks on the island of Ireland. If we had chosen to remain, then this would be a non-issue. Again, it is not remainers' fault that we decided to leave, you should take it up with the leave campaign for lying to you and completely ignoring this glaring issue with leaving.

&gt;Again, my breath has been taken away by the hypocrisy here. The dirty tactic of weakening the resolve of the British voter to attempt to ignore their wishes is disgusting.

Did the leave campaign not repeatedly say that making a deal would be easy? Remainers warned about this, but apparently you chose to ignore them, and believed the people that said that they could get a deal. I still don't understand why your issue is not with the people that repeatedly lied about the consequences of leaving. As far as I'm concerned, they got us in this mess, and have the sole responsibility for getting us out of it.

1) Serbia &amp; Montenegro 2004 (Call me biased, but hey, what do I care? As far as I'm concerned, this is our very best entry, and a contender for best ESC song of all-time, full stop. Zeljko is probably our most illustrious songwriter, and with Lane Moje he managed to encapsulate the very best of Serbian folk culture and bring it to the international stage packed into three minutes of absolute perfection. The flute, the violin solo, the epic drums, the brilliantly simple melody, the emotions, and of course Zeljko's powerful performance all add up to make a song that can give you chills even without understanding a single word of it. An absolute marvel of a musical composition which still touches me even to this day.)

2) Ukraine 2007 (If I ever wanted to encapsulate the spirit of Eurovision in a single song, this would be it. The song itself is danceable and incredibly fun, the lyrics are hilariously stupid, the choreography is iconic, the costumes are wonderfully ridiculous, the performance is camp on top of camp, and of course, Verka is just an absolute legend. Danilko is an absolutely hilarious comedian, and with this number he managed to combine his particular brand of humour with one of the catchiest damn entries in Eurovision history, all the while making it his goal to shock anyone and everyone. This is Eurovision drag done right!)

3) Russia 2012 (Continuing the tradition of silliness are these absolute icons. People go on bashing this entry, but really, I think it isn't deserving of the hate. I genuinely like the song, the babushki are really cute, the Udmurt language is a nice touch, and most importantly, it's something unique and original. I think that, these days, Eurovision is beginning to take itself a little bit too seriously, and I'm starting to really miss that particular type of Eurovision humour that entries like this can bring to the table. There's no reason to be ashamed of Eurovision's reputation for strangeness; I think we should embrace it instead. I will never not love this entry.)

4) Russia 2006 (When it comes to serious Russian entries, though, I don't think you can get much better than this. Admittedly, I quite liked Believe as well, but this song it just so much more in Dima's style, and it's also just a lot more enjoyable as a full package, not to mention being catchy as all hell. Definitely deserved its high placing.)

5) Italy 2019 (Probably recency bias at play, but this was definitely one of my favourites to win this year. Some of the other songs took some warming up to, but Mahmood had me sold upon the very first listen. Soldi is unique in its genre, it's different and daring in its cultural blend, and above all, it's really fun while also carrying emotional depth. Don't worry, Italy, you'll get a win one day...)

6) Italy 2011 (Speaking of robbing Italy, what about this one? For once, I find myself agreeing with the juries. I'm really keen on jazz, as you could probably tell, and this is about as unapologetically jazzy as you can get. Funky chord progressions, lovely instrumentation, and an enjoyable composition all add up to make what would have been a contender for a win, if it wasn't for Azerbaijan's underwhelming win.)

7) Cyprus 2018 (Now, this is a summer song incarnate. It's upbeat, danceable, and the performance helps elevate it into a completely different plane. I wasn't really blown away by any of the entries in 2018, but if one of them had to win, Fuego was definitely a big contender for me.)

8) Turkey 2010 (Not a huge fan of the genre, but when they make it work, they really make it work. Here's a very intense and very entertaining song which ended up being incredibly effective, if a little too dependent on staging. Still, I think this is one entry we won't be forgetting any time soon.)

9) Ukraine 2008 (To be honest, I preferred Dima, but for what it's worth, 2008 was quite a strong year, and this one was probably my favourite of the three very similar entries below him. The song is very infectious, the performance is full of energy, and the well-executed staging helps cement this as a timeless bop, in my eyes.)

10) Iceland 2009 (Hatari can go suck it; THIS is the Iceland I know and love. Such a beautiful ballad, with a phenomenally fantastical feel to it which is only enhanced by the superb staging. Yohanna had the incredible misfortune of competing in the same year as Rybak, but I fully believe that she would have been a winner otherwise.)

11) Russia 2015 (The hate this song got is probably my most heartbreaking Eurovision injustice. The crowd reaction was, to me, a perfect example of how many people who preach tolerance are actually only very selectively tolerant. Polina put everything into this performance, and you can sense that in every second of the song, especially the climax which is just brimming with emotion. I don't care what anyone says, this one was a stand-out of 2015, and that's really saying a lot.)

12) The Netherlands 2014 (I plead guilty to bias here, as I didn't really follow 2014 that closely seeing as how my country skipped competing, so I didn't have any proper time for this entry to grow on me. Still, even with that said, I can definitely feel the beauty of this composition emanating from the stage at all times. I will say that I'm slowly starting to warm up to it, so maybe sometime later, I'll be able to place this one a little higher.)

13) Denmark 2001 (I think this one was genuinely really fun, dated as it might be. It's got that kind of old-school charm about it that I can't help but respect. The early 00's were a mess, but I think this was kind of a diamond in the rough.)

14) Belgium 2003 (Obviously, the whole made-up language thing definitely earns it a lot of points with me, but I also quite like the semi-ethnic sound. It kind of sounds like a blend of all the cultures in Europe, and it was definitely a successful experiment in that regard.)

15) Russia 2000 (Here's a Russian entry I had all but forgotten about, and I think it's a real shame, because I quite enjoy it, for what it's worth. Somehow, it doesn't feel as dated as some of the other entries from the period.)

16) Australia 2016 (I'm really sorry about this, but this one just isn't my style. I actually like it a fair bit, it's just that I never found it that outstanding, but to its credit, I can definitely see the appeal in it. The vocal performance is phenomenal, and the chorus is actually quite memorable, so it's definitely a song that stays with you for a while. I will say this - I'd have this as a winner over Jamaletina any day.)

17) Bulgaria 2017 (Again, similar to the one above, I like it fine, but I just never got the huge appeal in it, and I like the ones above it a little better. With this one, I think it was missing that kind of spark that makes a ballad click with me. I thought it was kind of flat, in that I kind of feel like I'm waiting for the chorus throughout the entire song, and then it never actually happens. Credit where credit's due, though, Kristian's performance is impeccable.)

18) Malta 2005 (I think I can clump this one together with the two above, except I haven't got recency bias to save it. To be fair, when I really think about it, I actually find this to be even a slightly better composed ballad than Kristian's, but either way, I like it fine for what it is.)

19) Malta 2002 (Now, I don't dislike this one at all. Personally, I can listen to it just fine without getting tired of it, but I just found it kind of unremarkable overall, which is pretty fitting for such an unremarkable year. At least it's fun.)

20) Azerbaijan 2013 (Again, I wish I could say I dislike this one, but I really don't. I just find it bland, plain, and kind of forgettable. I really can't see how it managed to climb up to second place, but I guess it's just not my cup of tea.)",True,False,False,,,0,1567345687,,False,0,{},eyqk3mj,False,t3_cy8mdl,False,True,t3_cy8mdl,/r/eurovision/comments/cy8mdl/top_20_eurovision_runnerups_20002019/eyqk3mj/,False,,1575923010,1,True,[],False,eurovision,t5_2rsu8,r/eurovision,public,0,

When there‚Äôs a war, like there is in Yemen right now, our governments can claim that they are working to make things better and safer (in that particular case, by supporting Saudi Arabia all but unconditionally, the American government has probably extended rather than ameliorate suffering). At least when there‚Äôs a genocide, our governments will get a very stern look on their face and say, as they did with Burma not too long ago, ‚ÄúHey, we‚Äôre very concerned about all the genocide and ethnic cleansing you‚Äôre doing. If you keep being so naughty, we might put sanctions back on you!‚Äù All of those things, you know, might in theory lead to more serious escalation as our governments seek to at least mitigate the damage being done.

The wrought iron guns were typically made from strips of iron running along the length of the barrel being welded together, which would form the inside of the barrel. This was then reinforced by iron hoops heat shrunk onto the outside to stop the barrel from splitting along the welded seams. These reinforcing bands could form either a complete layer:

or be discrete separate bands:

* https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:40KgWroughtIronMurderer1410France.jpg

The inner strips running along the barrel and the reinforcing bands can be seen clearly in this falling-apart example:

* https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wrack_HH-Wittenbergen_Kanone_Dragge.jpg

To these, we can add that the Chinese were also casting guns in cast iron in large numbers already in the 14th century. One interesting variant was the forging of the inner barrel, followed by the casting of a reinforcing layer of cast iron around it.

The bronze guns are straightforward, although large ones presented technical problems due to their size. Some examples:

* 14th century European: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tannenbergb%C3%BCchse.jpg

* 14th century Chinese: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bronze_cannon_of_1332.jpg

* 16th century Ottoman: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Turkish_Bronze_Cannon.001_-_Tower_of_London.JPG

Very early barrels in China might be made of paper or bamboo, reinforced by being wrapped by wire or cord. These were typically for fire-lances, the gunpowder flame-thrower ancestor of the gun, but were also used for guns (and fire-lances that also shot projectiles). Wooden barrels were also used for fire-lances in Europe (presumably reinforced like the Chinese examples). Iron-reinforced and iron-lined barrels were occasionally used for cannons, with some being relatively recent:

Continuity New Labour. Factionally speaking that's the enemy, and I must stress this is all business there's no personal animus behind any of it, it's just politics. 

I don't want to boot them all out in a heroic purge - they have a right to be members - but I want to bureaucratically marginalise them, the same way the left was back when the right called the shots. 

The Labour party won 2 good election victories '97 and 2001 by moving the right, accepting the whole premise of Thatcherism and marginalising the unions/left. Then in 2005 we took big losses, the wheels were falling off New Labour even then, and then in 2010 under Brown we got smashed. 29% of the vote. After the 2008 financial crash this political space New Labour had previously existed on disappeared as electorates polarised around Europe.

We tried being nice and conciliatory with Ed Miliband, who might have been gutless but was smart enough to at least recognise the problem, especially since our European sister parties were already in the process of going through decline caused by much the same symptoms. However the right wing of the party bullied him into one concession after the other, he got monstered in the press, and we got another defeat in 2015 to thank for it. That's the problem with the soft left - *they're fucking soft!* 

So the Corbyn thing was necessary stop the rot and actually deal with the unfolding crisis that was  taking place. He was just the means to the end - didn't even want the job and to this day would probably take retirement if he could - and that was staking out the party ideologically as anti-austerity, anti-war, treat the unions as allies not enemies, strengthen party democracy and try and rebuild the movement again, after the sorry state the right had left in. 

I never expected Corbyn to win an election. The target was just to improve our share of the vote from the 30% Miliband got and hopefully pick up some new seats, to steady the ship whilst we focused on transforming the party and winning it to the left for an entire generation. We exceeded that expectation massively in 2017 and put this party back on its feet again. Corbyn could step down tomorrow and I wouldn't lose a moment's sleep but the reason he's staying is 1) we're in the midst of a major constitutional crisis and the government could collapse at any minute so Jeremy can't be making his succession plans openly he has to be a PM in waiting and 2) there's no immediate left-wing successor in place to carry on the job of party transformation. McDonnell as an interim leader with Long-Bailey as chancellor, Starmer as Home Sec instead of Abbott (whom I love and admire but should have stepped down ages ago) is doable, the members would accept that, but I don't think John wants it and it's not a long term solution.

companies will want to trade here yes, but there‚Äôs a big difference between mcdonalds/starbucks etc just having shops here and them having huge European HQ offices here that create high paying jobs, that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre going to lose if corbyn scares away businesses. 

&gt; The City extracts wealth from the rest of the economy instead of creating wealth for the economy.

this is nonsense, the city generates 10s of billions  in taxes every year. 

&gt; Ultimately this country has been run for far too long in the interests of big business and the rich and against the workers. 

Creating a friendly environment for business benefits workers by creating more opportunities for them to get jobs, France has much stricter workers rights and they also have had unemployment above 8% for 10 years (whereas were sitting at less than 4% rn), so is the French worker actually better off than the british worker?

and so did employment, incomes and productivity. im not so petty that id rather be poorer if it meant less people richer than me.

[],,viimatar,,,,[],,,,text,t2_43oaqvq3,False,False,[],"Perhaps. Without reading them, I can't really tell. I'd start with reading something about Ancient Greek mythology and traditions and see if that resonates with you or not. The next answer is Germanic Heathenry. Both have their own magical traditions that might be useful to start with. Of course, I'm somewhat biased, following a Revivalist Pre-Christian (Pagan/Heathen) religious tradition myself, but it's always better to start small with a definite frane than start too large and mix in elements that necessarily don't really fit together that well.

But - it's not always tied to your ethnic, religious, linguistic or even locally occurring traditions, paths or religious context what actually will speak to you in that sense. You might be drawn to Ancient Egyptian, African Diasporic, Taoist or Siberian Shamanistic traditions instead, and that is totally fine. Searching is fine. Even dabbling in several things at once or consequently is okay. Finding that one thing is not easy, and sometimes it takes years to find your ""own thing"". It's also possible that even if you find that one thing you will dedicate yourself to, there are other things that keep drawing you towards them - traditions, deities, practices. I'm not a huge fan of limiting oneself strictly and in my personal experience, a lot of things work well together if they all fit in personal practice and one is able to keep their respective rituals usually apart. (I imagine Norse gods would just laugh at Egyptian/Kemetic rites?)

Best advice I can give is to read a lot, but take everything with some caution and try to get a bigger picture of the scene. Historical accounts are not always helpful, as they tend to describe things from an outsider's point of view, especially so when talking about long-disappeared traditions. The Romans, or even worse, the Saxon missionaries, didn't give a good or comprehensive image of the German tribal Paganism probably. The only remaining contemporary accounts are from them, however. Sometimes it's better to start from mythologies we know from epics and then look for groups that already practice the stuff. There are quite a few of us in Europe, some even officially recognised as religious communities by a state. Even if their outlook, style or just their personality doesn't really suit you, inspiration is always free to take. Look around, google a bit, and you might find someone in your region to talk to. 

Just be careful, especially considering your young age, since there are no real gurus, just people who practice different things and some of them are stupid, some of them toxic, some of them narcissistic and abusive sexually socially or otherwise. Don't go meeting someone alone in a private place and definitely don't go along to anywhere they want to show you suddenly. If it feels strange, if you get anxious, if you feel harassed, pressured or scared, get away from them, go to a public place and get yourself safe. Also if it feels too good to be true, it probably is just that. Trust your instincts there. There are lots of good people in these groups, but also a share of those people who should not be there. For some reason, not everyone is able to handle Otherworldly stuff and stay sane, nice, or even safe for others. 

That warning said, search the Internet on how to shield and ward yourself. Any decent New Age or Witchcraft  site will give you the basics of the theory. Read a few of them and compare. Just mind, that though they tell how to create ""light bubbles"" or ""energy shields"" (same thing, different words), they rarely remember or even know to tell you the energy should be drawn from Earth itself (through your ""roots"", ""anchor"", ""grounding"" or what you choose to call it) or the surrounding free energies (be certain _not_ to draw it from other living beings or worse, some negative entities or something that gets angry because of what you did!), not to project it out from your own spiritual being.

&gt; Ghoultown is a psychobilly band from Texas, specializing in a mixture of classic Americana, Gothic music and dark, horrifying lyrics.

&gt; Formed in 1999, by vocalist/guitarist Count Lyle (Solitude Aeturnus, The Killcreeps), Ghoultown recorded its first 3-song EP in October of that same year. Titled Boots of Hell, the EP illustrated the power of the band's Tex-Mex blend while garnering rabid reviews, a fanbase and independent radio airplay. With Boots of Hell in circulation, the band's early buzz landed them several compilation appearances. The most notable being Skully Records' (NY) Gothabilly 2: Rockin' Necropolis where they share the bill with some of the best psychobilly acts around the world. As a kick off, the band was invited to participate in the world-release show held at NY's infamous CBGB's on Halloween 2000.

&gt; In early 2001, Ghoultown released their full-length debut Tales from the Dead West. The album, produced by Kol Marshall (Mercyful Fate, etc.), captured the versatility and unique sound of the Texan quintet from the powerful ""Killer in Texas"" to the Doors-esque ""Running From the Sun."" ""This album already has a place on my best of 2001 list,"" quoted a Harder Beat reviewer who reflected the positive response. Not only were ears turned, but eyes as well as the release pushed the band into new live show territory. With highlight performances such as an Atlanta benefit, which featured Jerry Only of the legendary Misfits as an onstage guest, Ghoultown has played with an amazing variety of bands such as Hank III, Rocket from the Crypt, The Independents, DRI, Bile, Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Flametrick Subs, Dick Dale, Road Kings, Men of Porn, Captured By Robots, Fear, Cruxshadows, and The Misfits.

&gt; By 2002, four of the band's songs were chosen for the soundtrack of the horror-slasher American Nightmare, starring B-movie queen Debbie Rochon (Tromeo and Juliet). The movie script was subsequently altered to include a Ghoultown performance cameo after the director witnessed the band live, and the video for their track ""Killer In Texas"" was included as a bonus on the DVD.

&gt; In the spring of 2002, the band released their follow-up Give 'Em More Rope, and Angry Planet Records signed an exclusive licensing deal with Netherlands-based Corazong Records to release the Ghoultown U.S. catalog in Europe and Canada. The first Euro-Canadian release was a special version of Tales from the Dead West, which included tracks from their Boots of Hell EP as well.

&gt; In the late summer, Ghoultown did a 35 date U.S. tour which included performances at NY's CBGBs to The Garage in L.A. The tour was concluded by a performance at one of the world's largest annual entertainment media conventions, Dragon*Con in Atlanta, where the band has performed for the last two years by popular demand.

&gt; Hitting 2003, Ghoultown's signature tune ""Killer In Texas"" made yet another appearance in a short film called Headcheese which was released on DVD with a movie called Freak. Appropriately, Headcheese was filmed in the same location as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre... house and all! Spending the first half of 2003 performing, the band toured the midwest and east coast, in addition to numerous Texas area shows. By the end of spring, Ghoultown completed work on songs for two upcoming Jon Keeyes films, Slice of Life and Hallow's End, the later in which they will also be making a cameo appearance. These are due on the market around Halloween.

&gt; In 2004, Ghoultown released a double disc set, Live From Texas!, which showcased their powerful live show on both CD and DVD. ""Ghoultown puts the grit back into rock 'n' roll with a blazing hellfire vengeance!"" said Horror Garage in praise of the release, which has garnered extremely positive feedback and become the best selling release to date.

As far as manufacturing in the EU goes. Your manufacturer will become an outsourced third party providing a service for the US company (a cost!)

You did not specify if your manufacturer will be in charge of shipping items to clients or if you'll be in need of a distribution center so I cannot expand on this.

As far as getting paid goes, you won't need a bank in the EU or even incorporate in the EU for the time being. Any credit card or PayPal charge can be credited in your USA bank account.

My advice would be to keep it as simple as possible. Once your business takes off, then start exploring In the EU, etc.  

Once you are ready for step 2, my best advice would be to create a partnership with a corp that is already established.

No, you're just a dick to animals that want nothing to do with you and you don't need to kill to survive or be healthy.

yes and then it fell and fell and fell, sometimes you have a to break a bone and reset it. 

your list of countries wage growth contains America who pulled back on the fiscal stimulus and implemented austerity in 2010 after the republicans took the house, Germany, spain and italy did austerity too. Spain, Italy and France all have massive unemployment compared to us, Spain and Italy as well have huge fiscal issues. I wouldn‚Äôt consider Poland a suitable comparison to england because their economy isn‚Äôt anywhere near as developed as ours. Japan is a very strange country to draw comparison to because their economy and demographics are so different to our own. 

&gt; Why is higher corporation tax a bad way to raise revenue?

raising the rate encourages tax avoidance, clamping down on tax avoidance pushes companies to invest less in your economies, economists on the left and right hate corporation tax. its a lousy way to tax the rich.

I am not demonizing the Chinese government. The Chinese government demonizes itself by sending tanks to massacre its people, running labor camps and harvesting organs from prisoners of conscience.

But the US doesn't put scientologists in labor camps or harvest their organs because of their belief. Scientologists can be as nutty as they want while Falon Gong practitioners can't even practice exercising in China. See the big difference between the US and communist China? 

Wrong!!! The US didn't bomb the entire country of Vietnam. It bombed the North which was communist controlled. The US helped southern Vietnam to fight against communism.

I was talking about this with my friend the other day, and I can't think of a fully correct way of handling this issue. I'm not sure if just letting those people into the country is correct though. 

""Why does country matter? There is definitely an efficient way to determine the skills of person X regardless of where he is to then designate proper education for him to fill in what he does not have.""

Their country? It doesn't matter. The receiving country? Again, it does matter, that government has a vested interest on being picky and choosy. 

Most 1st world countries have a immigration path for students (the ""proper education"" path). 

""About your second paragraph: Stop the bullshit, you specifically said the following and only it:
why does a country have any incentive to quickly let in people who ""just want to live there"" rather than significantly contribute to society?
You did not describe any other type of people that come from other countries.
I did not know your ancestry and situation and I do not really give a fuck about that, your statement was/sounded the way I described""

How does any of that warrant me being racist, xenophobic, or a bigot though? If you could get the definitions of those, and point out where exactly in my logic I am employing any of that, I'd like to know so I can better myself.

""Like there is totally no benefit from even the unskilled immigrants and like they will bring only losses."" 

Which is why it's so difficult for people to immigrate.

""Sure, they will need more initial investment to be turned into proper workforce, but this also totally depends on the type of work and their initial knowledge.""

Indeed it does. Hence why I sort by skilled and unskilled.

""You dont need to spend much money to teach someone how to pick fruits and work in harvest. ""

Are these not jobs that should be prioritized to citizens of the country first and foremost? For the less well off people who just need a job? Instead you want to bring in people to do that instead? Seems a bit exploity. 

""For electrical, plumbing and such jobs - there are many ways to teach them the basics that they need to work.""

A trade school education - something that should qualify them to enter the country if they have it, but shouldn't be the obligation for the country to teach them if they don't.

""In germany, the majority of services (electricians, painters, plumbers, construction and w.e) are not even german, they are full with polish people or people from eastern europe - many of which barely even know any german - yet they get jobs, they work, they were able to be put into companies and be productive and they were able to get the necessary education when needed.""

Europe has a fantastic boarder policy within the EU, so this is a pretty poor example with respect to the US specifically, which is essentially a locked country with Canada (whom they only allow skilled individuals legally immigrate from) and Mexico (whom they only allow skilled individuals legally to immigrate from). Also, you should provide a source on the majority being Polish, otherwise I'd have to argue that's pretty prejudiced of you to imply.

""So the matter is purely legality and not contribution to society and being skillful or not? I see. Make the immigrants legal then :)""

For pre-existing citizens, it's purely a matter of legality, they are already citizens. For non citizens, the government has an interest on being picky and choosy, and also has laws set up around immigrating legally.

You're simple misunderstanding is the ethereal, ill defined, utter nonsense that was the referendum could mean anything to everyone. In that version of Brexit, the NHS was getting ¬£350 mil per week, Free trade with the EU would be the easiest thing in human history, and Turkey was going to join the EU. 

The truth is the NHS is at breaking point and there will be no winfall, Trade deals a fucking hard, there isn't a cut in immigration, most EU citizens are getting leave to remain, and Turkey is as close to joining the EU as it ever was, ie a million miles from it (although now the UK is losing its power to veto such a move).

This is problem fantasies face when they come up against realities, and the reality is the nightmare that Brexit is turning out to be is utterly unpalatable to the vast majority of Britons, and when any true version of Brexit is put to the people poll after poll has Remain coming out on top.

A car carrying ship (6500 cars) travelling at 18 knots burns 50 tons per day of bunker oil.  Staring from Philly the trip is shortened by 6688 nautical miles, or 15.5 days of travel, 774 tons of fuel.  At 266 gallons per metric ton, that's 32 gallons per car saved.

US transport trucks average 7.3 mpg, although B-trains are less efficient around 5mpg (so I don't know where car carriers fall into that range).  Shipping by truck, 2915 miles, 5-7mpg, 583-416 gallons, 9 cars per truck, so 64-46 gallons per car.

Early EV delivery:  15 days early,  uk cars average 19.5 miles/day, @24mpg\*, 293 miles ICE driving or 12.2 gallons saved with early EV delivery.

You are only 23 and you want to live in Paris, so no wonder you can't afford any more, or are perhaps unwilling to pay more. I have lived in small rooms too because I wanted to live in the capital of expensive countries. It was a conscious choice I made and although not ideal, the good outweighed the bad for me at that time in my life.  Now I am about 10 years older than you are and I would no longer want to live in such a small place, but that's ok because I make more money now (and am soon relocating to a much cheaper part of the country).

It sounds like your mother put way too much weight on what your cousin said, and doesn't see you as an adult who can make good choices for his own life. At 23 you can put up with a lot more discomfort and lack of privacy than when you are older, and it sounds like she doesn't understand that.

Is she going to give you money so you can afford your own place, or is she expecting you to pay 95% of your income on rent or move out of Paris? In either case it should be 100% your decision where and how you live, not hers.

Your mother has extremely outdated views. I have friends who are in their mid 30's who are still living in a room in a house share. Why, you ask? Because rents are simply too expensive or not worth it, and they either can't afford more than a room and really want to stay in that city, or they choose not to spend all they can afford because they are saving towards their own home/future.

Your mother's attitude is extremely insulting and shows a total lack of understanding for people of our generation and the housing issues for us who want to/need to live in bigger cities in the west.

""You haven't even seen how I live so I think you are really jumping to conclusions here. I am only 23 and most people my age live with housemates. It's just the only way we can afford to live in bigger cities, and I want to live in a bigger city for the social as well as the professional opportunities (or education). I could live cheaper elsewhere but I can't do my job there, all my friends live in Paris too, and the bigger cities have the best career prospects. It's just what life is like these days. I don't plan to live in a small room forever but for now, I am content and I can afford it. If you think you need to dictate your adult son on how he should live, and want to either have it your way or you don't want me to be part of the last few weeks of your life, then I really don't know what to tell you. All I can say is that I will decide how to live my life myself and will not be manipulated into living a life you think I should be living. If you want to spend the last few weeks of your life being resentful and angry that your adult child can make his own decisions, be my guest.""

And then walk out. You can still go to the funeral because it's not like she's going to be there to notice you didn't listen to her.

Sorry man, she sounds like an entitled baby boomer who just doesn't understand that life is different for us than when she was 20.

PS: private rents even outside of bigger cities in western Europe are NOT cheap either, so for your 500 E (which is probably inclusive of bills etc), you may not be able to rent your own place in the countryside anyways. And then what? You need to quit your job and get a local job which may not be what you want or not at your level, may pay less, so at the end of the month after having paid all bills, you will likely end up with less money to spend than you do now. Believe me, I did the maths, and in many cases, moving away from the hustle and bustle of big city life isn't going to leave you with more spending money at the end of the month.

Se voc√™ tivesse lido o documento, teria percebido que o ""Stanford"" √© s√≥ o site da universidade onde o artigo est√° hospedado.  Como vc n√£o leu, ficar√° obviamente sem saber que o governo teve uma import√¢ncia extremamente relevante no desenvolvimento dos primeiros computadores eletr√¥nicos (seja na pesquisa direta, como foram os projetos desenvolvidos pelas For√ßas Armadas Americanas no contexto da Segunda Guerra Mundial e Guerra Fria, seja no suporte indireto atrav√©s de recursos financeiros ou de cientistas para organiza√ß√µes privadas, sem os quais certamente n√£o teria sido poss√≠vel concluir seus desenvolvimentos).

&gt;Mesma coisa Harvard, MIT. Todas institui√ß√µes privadas. As melhores universidades dos EUA s√£o particulares.

Isso de modo algum muda o que eu disse. Se voc√™ pesquisar, ver√° que todas essas universidade recebem fundos gigantescos do governo para pesquisas variadas. Se esse fundos n√£o existissem, seria muito dif√≠cil elas pagarem com os pr√≥prios bolsos pesquisas que n√£o raro beiram aos bilh√µes. Al√©m do mais, ao contr√°rio de voc√™, que afirma que o governo n√£o pesquisa **nada**, eu n√£o estou defendendo que a iniciativa privada n√£o exer√ßa, por vezes, o papel de pesquisadora (muito embora, devido a pr√≥pria natureza da pesquisa de base, isso seja bastante incomum).

N√£o √© correto que o desenvolvimento se d√™ exclusivamente por essas empresas por dois simples motivos: o primeiro -- e mais relevante, que inclusive eu ressaltei na minhas mensagens -- √© que essas empresas n√£o seriam o que s√£o se n√£o fosse o governo americano fornecendo recursos (financeiros e t√©cnicos, j√° que o desenvolvimento se d√° via de regras em bases do Estado (como a tal √Årea 51)) durante todas as etapas do projeto; o segundo, tamb√©m relevante, √© que grande parte das tecnologias que elas utilizam derivam de pesquisas promovidas pelo Estado, como √© o caso, por exemplo, das tecnologias stealth aplicadas a avia√ß√£o. Isso novamente confirma o que eu j√° disse: a iniciativa privada tem sido excelente no papel de produzir (popularizar) essas tecnologias e aprimor√°-las.

TL;DR, odds are they received at most ~$500k per person to reimburse them for the past five (six?) years of development **and have no clear revenue stream moving forward**. 

&gt; Revenue =/= profit. Steam's cut, Unreal's cut, payments to employees around the globe, working with those foreign laws, and¬†taxes. Let's imagine that Mordhau sold 2 million copies at an average cost of $29 (the game's price depends on the region and the means in which it was bought, e.g. first week sale, the 3000 kickstarter buyers, etc.).

&gt; 2,000,000 x 29 = $58,000,000

&gt; Cool, but now Steam takes 30% off of that
58,000,000 * 0.7 = 40,600,000

&gt;Then Unreal takes 5% of that
40,600,600 * 0.95 = 38,570,000

&gt;Taxes vary immensely across the various countries... but European taxes are generally a lot higher than American taxes. I don't know how corporate vs personal taxes factor into all this, but my guess is that you take that above number and reduce it by the corporate tax rate, then it is again taxed by the personal tax rate.

&gt; Corporate Tax of 20% (Slovenia at 19%, but I'm not sure how this works with Triternion having people around the globe)
38,570,000 * 0.8 = 30,856,000

&gt; This is assuming 2 million copies sold, which I don't think is the case. Over a million is confirmed, which would be $15,428,000. One and a half million would be at $23,142,000, which is probably closer to reality.

&gt; This isn't even factoring in any of the loans and debts that marox and co. almost certainly had to undertake. There was a huge rush before release to push the game out due to ""money"". The devs had to live somehow with $0 income from Q4 2014- Q2 2019. Mordhau had some very strong guerilla marketing around release, whether they had to pay the big bucks for it or not is unknown cause it's quite literally none of our business.

&gt; Then as marox allocates that ~$23,142,000 to the 11 members of the team, each of them is taxed differently based on the bracket. I think that this tax rate can be as high as 50%, so even if you were a relatively huge contributor to the team and were about to receive $1 million, that could be reduced to $500,000 that you actually get to take. This sounds like a lot, but considering you weren't paid for 4.5 years, this averages to an annual income (not gross revenue) of $110,000. Certainly still good by most people's standards, but you weren't able to spend any of that for 4.5 years +¬†this isn't your income anymore¬†unless Mordhau miraculously sells at a static rate of 1.5 million copies per year. Certainly far from being able to retire.¬†

&gt;... 

&gt; As already mentioned, chances are that Mordhau already made of the majority of the amount of money it will ever make (unless it explodes again with some significant patch, which is possible and hopefully what happens - CSGO erupted with the skins update, Blizzard games had expansion packs which are just today's version of 2.0.1 and 3.0.1 patches, Minecraft took a few years to truly explode, Rainbow 6 Siege was more successful quite a bit post-launch than on release). The¬†income¬†of the company isn't $20 mil per year, but probably rather low now that the game has settled down and dried out. Yet, the salaries of all 11 employees must still be paid. In addition to that are server and upkeep costs.

It most definitely is the case. I have quoted the exact text of the decision, with its underlined emphasis on ""military"" targets.

&gt;The decision was made before the bombing of Rotterdam, which was used just as an excuse.

That's wrong as well. The War Cabinet met on 14 May and agreed: 

&gt;To take no decision in the meantime in 
regard to the employment of our heavy 
bomber force.

They were certainly under pressure from the RAF to act, and I am sure would have done so sooner or later. After all, the Luftwaffe was busy bombing targets all over France, Belgium and the Netherlands (and had already bombed Norway), so it was inevitable Bomber Command would begin attacks on Germany. But the government met on the 14th and refused to change policy, they met on the 15th and did so.

&gt;The targets were nominally to be military objectives, but locating even cities was very difficult at night, let alone military targets within them.

Yes. The same was true of daylight operations, of course. On the afternoon of 10 May 3 Luftwaffe bombers, which had set out to bomb Dijon in France, became lost and instead attacked Freiburg in Germany, killing 57 civilians. And on the 9/10 May, just as the attack on France, Belgium and the Netherlands was beginning, 1 Luftwaffe aircraft dropped incendiary bombs in a field outside Canterbury in southern England. They were almost certainly meant for a target in France or Belgium, but bombing was inaccurate. 

But the problem is you are applying different standards to the RAF and Luftwaffe. The Luftwaffe carried out attacks on enemy territory in Poland, Norway, France, Belgium and the Netherlands, by both night and day, before the RAF carried out its first attacks on Germany. Yet you want to portray RAF attacks as deliberate attacks on cities (when the orders are absolutely clear they weren't), and German attacks as aimed at precise military targets.

&gt;Overy went through Cabinet records and says the papers he found prove that without doubt.

I'd be very interested. I can also quote to you the War Cabinet meeting of 15 September, and the RAF's response:

The War Cabinet:
&gt;The bombing of London had been quite indiscriminate and the view was expressed that our raiders over Germany ought to be instructed not to return home with their bombs, if they failed to locate the targets which they were detailed to attack.

The response from Archibald Sinclair, Secretary of State for Air:

&gt;Dear	 Prime Minister, In Conclusion 1 (i) of the minutes of 
yesterday's War Cabinet Meeting I am invited ""to give 
instructions that our bombers operating over Germany 
should not return with their bombs in the event of 
their failing to locate their targets"". 
I find that an instruction had already been 
issued to Bomber Command that pilots should make every 
effort to avoid bringing their bombs home and I attach 
a copy of our signal. It does not, however, go so 
far as the Cabinet Conclusion in that it permits pilots 
to bring home their bombs in the last resort if they 
cannot find any military target. I think it would 
be unwise to go further than this instruction. 
(a)	 Because our present policy is to bomb 
only military objectives and this 
was re-emphasised at this morning's 
Cabinet.

&gt;I do not propose therefore to issue any 
further instruction to Bomber Command but I should be 
glad of your approval. 
Yours sincerely, 
(Signed) ARCHIBALD SINCLAIR.

Churchill replied ""This may stand for the present"".

That's the 15 September, when the Blitz had been going on for more than a week, with several thousand civilians killed in the UK by Luftwaffe bombing.

&gt;I don't have the book right now with me but can post the relevant quote tomorrow if you are interested.

From Overy, The Bombing War

&gt;On 15 May the Cabinet finally took the decision to approve a full bombing strategy against German targets where civilians might be casualties, as long as they were ""suitable military objectives"".

&gt;The change in priorities necessitated a revision of the rules on the conduct of air warfare laid down in August 1939, which had mite it illegal to attack targets in which civilians might be ""negligently"" killed. On 4 June 1940 the Air Ministry issued new guidelines for Bomber Command, cancelling the earlier instructions. The intention of killing civilians was still regarded as a violation of international law, but attacks could be made on military targets ""in the widest sense"" (factories, shipyards, communications, power supply, oil installations) in which civilian casualties would be unavoidable but should be proportional. ""Undue loss of civil life"" was still to be avoided, which meant returning to base or jettisoning bombs safely if the target could not be properly identified.

So what is your contention? That before 15 May the Germans had not bombed targets that could have resulted in the loss of civilian life? That would be a preposterous argument. At the very least the Luftwaffe had bombed without regard for civilian life, even if it hadn't stepped over the line into deliberately targeting civilians (my own belief is that it had in Poland, but I don't know enough about that campaign to argue). 

At every stage the RAF only responded to German escalations. The RAF was forbidden to attack anything other that warships at sea until March 1940, when a Luftwaffe attack on the Orkney Islands killed a British civilian (James Isbister). As a response the RAF attacked the seaplane base on the island of Hornum. 

The RAF first attacked German transport targets west of the Rhine in response to the German attack on France, Belgium and the Netherlands (which included bombing attacks). They first began attacks on military targets elsewhere in Germany in response to not just Luftwaffe attacks across western Europe, but the specific attack on Rotterdam, which showed the Luftwaffe would have no regard for the number of civilian casualties they were prepared to inflict in order to secure their objectives.

The RAF first began attacks on military targets of opportunity in mid September, following the start of the Blitz on British cities. They carried out their first area attack on a German city in December 1940, following the attack on Coventry and with 20,000 British civilians dead from German bombing.",True,False,False,,,0,1567370469,,False,0,{},eyrjsrp,False,t3_cy4py2,False,False,t1_eyre3d0,/r/europe/comments/cy4py2/on_this_day_exactly_80_years_ago_german/eyrjsrp/,False,,1575940499,7,True,[],False,europe,t5_2qh4j,r/europe,public,0,

* blackheads around my T zone - nose, forehead, temple
* whiteheads
* ingrown facial hair
* the whole skin is kind of textured
* dark circles under eyes

Until recently I washed my face with water and thoroughly dry it with towel almost every morning and night - sometimes I'd skip some days hh. My face would usually feel dry first tens of minutes and then gradually get oily before another cleaning routine.

So now I decided to start caring for my face more. My ultimate goal is to 

1. **look forever young**
2. **energize face**
3. **get rid of dark circles**
4. eye care to prevent eye bags

I read about essentials for men are some product to wash your face and then moisturizer. I wash my face and then moisturize everyday morning and night (starting 2w ago).

* To wash my face I started using [Balea Men Washing Gel - Clean&amp;Care](https://german-drugstore.com/product/men/men-skincare/balea-men-washing-gel-clear-care-150ml/) \- my face would feel really dry, tight and tense after washing
* For moisturizing I used [Cien Men Hydro Care 24h Moisturiser](https://world.openbeautyfacts.org/product/20516482/hydro-care-cien), [ingredients](https://world.openbeautyfacts.org/images/products/20516482/4.jpg)
* Today I switched to using a day cream after washing my face [Cien Men Q10](https://www.quechoisir.org/comparatif-ingredients-indesirables-n941/cien-men-q10-intensive-anti-wrinkle-cream-pi34796/)

After adapting this routine my face would still get oily especially during the day. It is weirdly glowing like a polished car throwing reflections - I have no idea if it's good or not but I am hating this. Would much prefer a matte difuzed look on my skin. 

Am I using correct products? What can I add to the routine?

Basically this is what ""catch and release"" was all about. Crossing the border without permission is a misdemeanor, and this administration decided to make that a jailable offense, unlike past administrations who would send families back from whence they came. *This* decision to jail is what lead (on purpose) to family separation, children in cages, and the current shitshow at the border, because under US law kids can't be put in jail with adults. In other words, the difference between Trump and past administrations is that they are making a conscious decision to separate families (and now want to hold children indefinitely) as a deterrent to crossing our border. 

As a matter of fact, originally there was no documentation kept of any separations, no way to re-unify these families until a class action lawsuit from parents was decided in their favor, which is why you saw a scramble to do DNA testing to reunite children with their parents. The upshot of all of this is that yes, people like Stephen Miller (and Steve Bannon) see brown people as an assault on ""Western European Christian values"", and are doing everything they can to deter it, while spreading disinformation to make them seem less less racist, radicalizing ICE, and bending the law as far as it can be bent. Anyway, children in cages is new, it sucks, and that's why everybody is upset. 

By the way, the stuff about Miller and Bannon is out of their own mouths, although mostly they see us in a war with Islam, it's obvious from the demonization of our southern neighbors how this administration feels about them. Fun fact: we are -2,000,000 Mexicans over the last decade or so. A net loss, and yet Trump feels the need to call it an invasion and people buy that bologna.

America is for anyone and everyone who wants to be here. I think the large number of people living here ""undocumented"" is a sign of a larger issue with our immigration and border policies.

There is, generally speaking, three kinds of borders. Open, controlled, and closed. The American-Mexian border is, at the moment, technically a controlled border, but is much closer to a closed border (eg. The Koreas or the Berlin Wall) than an open one (eg. Most of Europe).

On a controlled border scale of 1-10 (with 0 being open and 11 being closed) I feel like we're somewhere around 8 or 9. I think we should dial it back to, like, a 2.

Basically it should be significantly easier to cross than it is now but still somewhat more difficult than driving from Chicago to Milwaukee. Tightening restrictions has only made the issue more fervent. I believe we can have a mildly controlled border with little to no issues.

Gibraltar authorities were finally pushed to releasing the tanker but 24 hours before its release the white house issued a request to seize the vessel which thankfully did not go through.

Mas num passado n√£o muito remoto (pense 20-30 anos), eram colonia/territ√≥rio brit√¢nico.

Ent√£o, apesar de serem etnicamente chineses, esse pessoal cresceu com valores do oeste, tanto culturalmente como politicamente.

A√≠, como parte de acordo entre o Reino Unido e a China, Hong Kong passou a ser territ√≥rio chines, e desde ent√£o, a China tem feito de tudo pra ir aos poucos erodindo isso.

Ent√£o, por exemplo: Hong Kong tem elei√ß√£o pr√≥pria pra determinar seus governantes, MAS, quem define os candidatos √© o partido comunista chin√™s. Ent√£o no fim das contas, voc√™ vota num fantoche.

Por ser territ√≥rio, HK manteve v√°rias liberdades que os chineses n√£o tem, como por exemplo -- l√° o acesso √† maioria das plataformas de midia social n√£o √© bloqueada (como √© na China), MAS, o governo chines fica de olho no que voc√™ posta online.

--

Pois bem, qual o fato gerador dos protestos de hoje em dia, uma vez que isso que eu passei um tempo escrevendo n√£o √© nada de novo?

--

O que mudou foi que a China passou uma lei, recentemente, qu e d√° a ela total poder de extradi√ß√£o sob os habitantes de Hong Kong, pra China, pra responder criminalmente contra algumas a√ß√µes/atitudes.

E pra foder tudo, a lei foi escrita de maneira extremamente vaga e amb√≠gua, dando a entender que pode/vai ser totalmente abusada pelo governo Chines, usando ela como pretexto pra mandar pra China quem ela quiser, por qualquer motivo obscuro, e essa pessoa vai simplesmente ""ser desaparecida"" por l√°, e ningu√©m vai saber o que aconteceu com ela.

--

A√≠ voc√™ tem, de um lado, o pessoal de Hong Kong, que n√£o quer ""ser ref√©m"" desse tipo de coisa, e n√£o quer ter as suas liberdades retiradas, e do outro, voc√™ tem o governo Chines, que TEM Hong Kong como parte do seu territ√≥rio, e, de certa maneira, n√£o pode tolerar esse tipo de movimento dentro do seu pr√≥prio pa√≠s, pra n√£o enfraquecer a sua soberania sob seus territ√≥rios.

--

Quem t√° certo?

Pra mim, tinha que separar logo, HK virar o seu pr√≥prio pa√≠s, e dar bye/wave pra China.

A China, √≥bvio, n√£o vai querer isso nunca, porque eles enchem o cu de dinheiro com todos os impostos que conseguem tirar de l√°.

--

E, pra infelicidade do pessoal de HK, ningu√©m vai querer comprar uma briga abertamente com a China por causa deles.

Protectionism as a whole is bad for trade. The entire purpose of the world's main trading organisation is to stop this. There are exceptions in a few small areas and situations, but high tariffs on foods is not one of them. Our farmers don't need protecting. Our automotive industry (such that it is) doesn't need protecting. This is the fallacy of most remain voters - we need zero trade protection from the EU because they are nice and soft and fluffy, but we need big trade protection from every other country because they are bad and smelly and made from slugs. So answer me this - far more cars are made in the EU than the UK; why doesn't our automotive industry need protecting from the EU? Our farmers don't produce nearly as much as the EU; why don't they need protecting from it? Overall your low effort disengenious questions (that you absolutely thought were gotcha moments) have just revealed you to be anti-free trade. At least where it suits you.

I bet you thought your claim on working in IT was a gotcha moment too, but sadly for you I wasn't pretending to know about GDPR so I know how little IT knows about it beyond a project spec.

In physical geography, a steppe (Russian: —Å—Ç–µ–ø—å, IPA: [st ≤ep ≤]) is an ecoregion, in the montane grasslands and shrublands and temperate grasslands, savannas and shrublands biomes, characterized by grassland plains without trees apart from those near rivers and lakes. The prairie of North America (especially the shortgrass and mixed prairie) is an example of a steppe, though it is not usually called such. A steppe may be  semi-arid or covered with grass or shrubs or both, depending on the season and latitude. The term is also used to denote the climate encountered in regions too dry to support a forest but not dry enough to be a desert.

***

**Eurasian nomads**

The Eurasian nomads were a large group of nomadic peoples from the Eurasian Steppe, who often appear in history as invaders of Europe, the Middle East and China.

The generic title encompasses the varied ethnic groups who have at times inhabited the steppes of Central Asia, Mongolia, and what is now Russia. They domesticated the horse around 3500 BC, vastly increasing the possibilities of nomadic life, and subsequently their economy and culture emphasised horse breeding, horse riding and nomadic pastoralism; this usually involved trading with settled peoples around the steppe edges.  They developed the chariot, wagon, cavalry and horse archery and introduced innovations such as the bridle, bit and stirrup, and the very rapid rate at which innovations crossed the steppelands spread these widely, to be copied by settled peoples bordering the steppes.

I'd rather study this thought process of yours in a vacuum that doesn't rely on, ""here's why a different idea is worse."" I would like an argument of, ""here's why this idea is so strong that other people might have a tough time to challenge it.""

I‚Äôm happy to do that. See, when most people think of communism, they think of Russia or China, which did have many successes, but also had many failures, both real and perceived(and in some cases just exaggerated or made up) that are used as arguments against the idea. Usually those failures are also analyzed in a vacuum, that is, they don‚Äôt also weigh the successes with those failures in any level, and also ignore many factors that caused those situations. The Holodomor famine in Ukraine is a very popular argument against communism, that soviet policies caused the famine in the Ukraine, but this isn‚Äôt the whole truth, and also ignores(quite intentionally) important historical context. In those times, famines happened in that area of Europe multiple times every decade, and were always terrible for the population. The reason this particular famine was so bad, was because the ruling class in the Ukraine, opposed to the new collectivization policies the soviet government was implementing, either burned or stashed their entire harvests to deny the population what they wanted for themselves. And of course, a famine hit at the same time, making the results of this absolutely devastating to the population of Ukraine. This may have been ‚Äúprovoked‚Äù by the collectivization policies, but the fault still lies on the rich elites in Ukraine adopting a scorched earth policy in response. It‚Äôs also important to note that the soviet government also did as much as they could to mitigate the effects this would have on the population. They diverted a lot of grains and agriculture produced in mainland Russia to the Ukraine, but still millions died. I would argue that the conclusion people reach about the holodomor is the opposite: that famine would have been way worse if it wasn‚Äôt for the soviet response to it. In that vein, they also introduced agricultural policies in the years following, and because of that, the Ukraine never saw a single famine again, where they were about a tri annual occurrence.

I don‚Äôt wanna just address criticisms, I only went into that example to show how the perceived failures of communism are often either exaggerated or blatantly misrepresented. I‚Äôd rather talk about the successes to satisfy your wish to analyze the pros of communism in a vacuum. So from here on that‚Äôs what I will do.

Before the 1917 revolution, Russia was a backwater feudal state that had little relevance in the world. Ten years after the revolution, they went on to become a world power, rivaling the us, becoming instrumental to defeating the nazis(many, including myself, argue that Russia was the biggest lone factor in their defeat). This was done alongside rapidly expanding women‚Äôs rights in ways that the us hadn‚Äôt done until recent decades and in some ways still hasn‚Äôt done(they literally ended the wage gap lol), expanded literacy rates by up to 700% by some accounts, industrializing at ungodly speed, being completely unaffected by the Great Depression etc. and that‚Äôs just Russia. I‚Äôm gonna move on to Cuba now, as they‚Äôre actually the best shining example of communism‚Äôs successes.

So Cuba. They went from being a us puppet tourist sexslave island, to being a major player in global south politics. Despite an embargo for half of a century, they became a fully self sustained nation, to the point where they‚Äôre actually the ONLY country in the world that has an acceptable human development index while also not consuming more than their fair share of resources. That balance of human quality of life vs climate protection on its own is an astoundingly good argument for the success of communism, but Cuba doesn‚Äôt stop there. They completely eliminated child malnutrition, to the point being recognized by UNICEF as being the only country to do this. They have a world class healthcare system that is so good, that the doctors often have nothing to do so Cuba sends them out on missions to third world countries and are considered one of the biggest exporters of medical aid/relief to suffering countries. Their medical research has gotten them to the point where they are researching cancer vaccines that actually show promise and effect. They completely outlawed homelessness. And by that I don‚Äôt mean they throw homeless people in jail. They made it a law that the government is held responsible for anyone ending up homeless, and are responsible to help anyone homeless and give them shelter and out of the situation. Because of this, Cuba has an 85% HOMEOWNERSHIP rate, as in, 85% of the population, OWN their own homes. That‚Äôs a huge number on its own, in a vacuum, but if we were to put that metric up to capitalist countries it WOULD show a lot more, but I‚Äôm gonna avoid going there on that.

Some of the stuff I‚Äôm saying here might sound crazy but feel free to fact check it. I‚Äôm on my tablet so providing links is a pain in the ass for me, otherwise I would provide them myself. A good resource if you want to look into it is if you go to r/communism, and search up their ‚Äúdebunking myths‚Äù thread. Actually, I‚Äôm gonna go over there right now to copy the link, wait for my edit and I‚Äôll put it here. Mind you, it‚Äôs obviously biased pro communism, but it‚Äôs filled with scholarly writings.

&gt; Dreaming is a traditional Doom metal band from Zschopau, Germany in the vein of St. Vitus or perhaps Witchfinder General, but with a slightly more positive feel to it; heavy riffing and slighty ""hollow sounding"" melodramatic clean vocals with some tendencies towards stoner.
Founded in summer 1993, they gave their first concert in 1994.
The current line-up consists of Sandro Uhlmann (guitars, vocals), Thomas Becker (drums) and Thomas Schulz (bass, vocals).

&gt; The demo ""Smirten Pr√∏ben"" was released in 1994 with  200 copies sold and is now available for download here.
They've done a lot of gigs with bands like Naevus, Mirror of Deception, Dawn of Winter, Solitude Aeturnus, Morgana Lefay amongst others.

&gt; In fall/winter 1998 recording sessions for the first full album ""T√Ω V√∏l≈ì√Ω"" were started, which
has been released on October 1st 1999.

&gt; Further shows in 2000/2001 with Solstice, The Lord Weird Slough Feg, Warning and Jack Frost.

&gt; In spring 2001 a new song from the forthcoming album has been released on the ""Psychedelic"" compilation and  ‚ÄúThe Warstarter‚Äù was recorded for the ""St. Vitus Tribute"" on RavenMoonRecords.
In 2003 they played at the first European Doom festival ""Doom Shall Rise""  and in 2004 at the ""Autumn of Doom Festival"" with Reverend Bizarre, Officium Triste, Mirror Of Deception, Jack Frost, Rise and Shine and Whispering Gallery.

&gt; Their latest full-length album is simply called ""II"" and saw light of day in 2006.

As it mobilizes people rather than potentially overwhelming them. Sadly the media has latched onto the existential threat narrative and politicians have fed into this (trying to get eyeballs on the issue) creating a feedback loop. They aren't wrong to call it an existential threat if we don't act, it's just not the most effective way to frame the issue.

[Here is a good video for communicating about climate change to try and actually mobilize action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-oaYz3Jexs).

My main criticism of this video is that it focuses largely on individual actions and is rather defeatist on any action being taken by political leadership (too much psychology, not enough sociology). Think if you had taken this approach to JFK's moonshot, nothing would have happened as the endeavor was too big. Ditto for FDR's New Deal. These were paradigm shifts. The challenge for the Green New Deal is that it must combine the broad based economic movement of the New Deal, which was eased by a huge economic collapse and a hugely mobilized labor movement, with the shear political will that was the moonshot, that led to massive shifts in societal priorities from scratch by placing value on STEM education and pursuing the future for its own sake.

This is kind of what David talks about all the time with Trump. The people you need to convince aren't the deniers, but the base and those that are undecided or uncertain what to do. Bernie's proposal for the [Green New Deal](https://berniesanders.com/issues/the-green-new-deal/), or at least a policy proposal like it, is the perfect option as it gives a clear and concrete goal that we can frame with the grand narrative structure Stokes outlines in the first video or this [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5h6ynoq8uM).

The main point is we need a story centered around ideas such as ecological stewardship (more religious/ethical overtones), the good life (move away from consumption and focusing on human flourishing \[think UBI and cooperatives\]), re-wilding (let nature come back into balance), or green growth (soc dem version focusing on changing capitalism to work better with limited resources).

Now for your actual question.

**Why Climate Change is an Existential Threat:**

The  [IPCC's actual claim was that we need a 45% reduction in our CO2 emissions by 2030 in order to hit carbon neutral by 2050 (to stay at 1.5 celsius)](https://www.climaterealityproject.org/blog/2030-or-bust-5-key-takeaways-ipcc-report). The problem is that we are still debating if this is even an issue right now. Not, what is the best way to approach this, but is it even an issue. It should also be pointed out that the IPCC usually gives out pretty conservative estimates of the models to avoid being called hysterical.

The scenario you outline only happens if we can keep the warming within [1.5-2 celsius](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNgqv4yVyDw), however this video doesn't account for was the human reaction to the changes. The Syrian refugee crisis was [likely exacerbated by climate instability](https://climateandsecurity.org/2015/09/10/on-syrian-refugees-and-climate-change-the-risks-of-oversimplifying-underestimating-the-connection/). This crisis as well as the slow recovery from the 2008 crash arguably helped to contribute to the rise of authoritarians across Europe. And we have seen something similar in the US with [refugees](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/12/04/the-crisis-in-honduras-should-matter-to-the-u-s/) [fleeing Honduras](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/how-climate-change-is-fuelling-the-us-border-crisis), leading to the adoption of a much more fascistic/militaristic political landscape.

This problem is likely only going to get worse, and we have also seen an uptick in willingness to deploy nuclear weapons from countries including the US, Russia, India, Pakistan, and North Korea. There is a very real chance someone might get desperate and use these if put under enough pressure. We also fail to account that this level of peace is not the norm of human history and if we go to war much of our innovative capacity will redirect toward that endeavor potentially diverting away from climate change at the most critical juncture. This isn't that far fetched as that is what we are already doing right now in the US despite the military declaring climate instability as a leading national security threat.

[We need to lay down the infrastructure before we ever get to the point where we experience the problems to begin with or it will likely already be too late](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGJJs_nTow8). Even at 2 celsius around 5-14% of the world's GDP could be erased as  [cities are underwater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvJ412PxHR0),  [crops lands get dried out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SModhHUpcj0), and precipitation and biomes shift across the world.

Sadly, as it stands we are on track to go all the way to  [4.3 celsius](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17aE91SBMoY) if we do nothing. That my friend is indeed much more apocalyptic. What the IPCC doesn't necessarily account for is that the models cannot account for the random introduction of tipping points. For instance, few models were likely accounting for a massive acceleration in deforestation of the Amazon due to human activity which is a major carbon sink, or the [fires that have started in the drying Arctic peat bogs in North America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4AczmNQByY) (at least this soon). God forbid that we see any volcanic chains become active or major eruptions due to flood basalts in the next thousand years on top of everything else.  [These all trigger positive feedback cycles much sooner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZlBspV2-M),

The existential threat is not necessarily for any generation alive today, but rather any that we might want to come after. If we do nothing the current generations will likely survive in just the hellish landscape you predicted, but the downstream consequences may become so severe that our technology won't be enough to put the genie back in the bottle in time. Even with massive carbon sinking efforts we are talking about the scale of decades for the problem to reverse itself as glaciers don't reform overnight nor will the atmosphere start to clear.

That is the thing we suck at accounting for, the shear scale of the problem ([known as a hyperobject](https://youtu.be/CqCx9xU_-Fw?t=378) ). It is almost too large to really comprehend, hence why we have to create models to map the problem. However the problem is so damned big with so many interplaying factors that if you miss even a few your model is likely under estimating the results, which is often what we see happening, especially as some of the feedbacks kick in.

Even at 2 celsius the estimates for the loss of ecological services provided number in the trillions per year in world output and range from changes to the water cycle, nitrogen fixation, the carbon cycle, pollination, oxygen production, temperature regulation, etc, etc. Here is a study that looks at the rough value provided by biome ([Global estimates of the value of ecosystems and their services in monetary units](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212041612000101#s0105)) with all services valued at around [$44 trillion per year](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3339477/). [Protecting these environments therefore can bring amazing returns on investment](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-10/d-wac101509.php), but in the short term seems expensive as who should be responsible for footing the initial bill if the whole world might stand to benefit. We are directly seeing this question play out with Balsanaro and the Amazon in Brazil.

The problem is the rate at which the climate is changing. As humans we think 100 years sound like forever as that is a long single lifetime. However we are talking planetary scales and at that rate this is insane. That and there are always lags to the actual changes as the world reaches a new equilibrium. The effects we are talking about will come at an accelerating pace as more carbon hits the atmosphere but the full effects of what is already in the air will probably take a decade to fully manifest.

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsA3PK8bQd8) gives you an idea why most of the public on the left is freaking out, however it assumes that we change nothing in our current technology or culture. The problem is that this video communicates in a way that may make people become more insular and tribalistic as it is largely mobilizing fear tactics. This is precisely the opposite effect you want, as it is a lack of collective effort when we approach a problem this big that will make us fail. However, it does do a good job of outlining why individual action isn't going to be enough without a large social or political movement. [Another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHdcpxmJ6vg) that suffers from a similar problem but outlines another important point that many of the largest companies have known this was a problem since the 80s though the scientific community has [known for much longer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_climate_change_science).

Take Tibet for example. The CCP have a policy of importing Han Chinese (the ethnic majority in China) to Tibet to try and ethnically and culturally replace the Tibetan people. Allegedly a similar policy exists in Xinjiang with the Uighur. Those regions are (currently) majority Tibetan/Uighur, but it's perfectly reasonable for Tibetans or Uighur to be concerned about this demographic change, and oppose the Han migration. That doesn't make them racist, in my book.

The same applies everywhere. It's OK for Native Americans / First Nations to be concerned about their  dropping demographic percentage of the North American total. I also think it's OK for European Americans to be concerned about the same issue, even though they are (currently) the majority. In a democracy, people tend to vote somewhat tribally, often aligning with their race, and clearly being a minority isn't great in this context. In fact, democracy or not, minorities around the world do relatively poorly economically and socially; look at the Rohingya muslims, or African Americans, or Jamaican British, or Nepalese in Japan, or Jews in Europe (historically) etc etc. Clearly, it's perfectly rational and reasonable to be anxious about being or becoming a minority, and that anxiety doesn't equal racism.

Note that I don't endorse weird conspiracy theories: I know there are strange claims that there exists a sinister cabal engineering the downfall of the 'White Race' or whatever, and I don't believe that for a second. At any rate, the opposite cabal (white supremacists) exists and is quite influential. However, if you're white and you're seeing your community or country's demographics shift away from majority white, you can expect a decrease in your relative political power (and cultural power, and maybe economic power too), and it's totally understandable to be nervous about that, and you're not a racist for worrying about it or for opposing the change. You may be a bit selfish, but that's not the same as being racist or evil - everyone's selfish. Expressing this demonstrably rational concern should not be hate speech.

To be more explicit about why this isn't racism: Wanting to remain the majority isn't the same as hating other ethnic groups. It's simply commonsense self-preservation of power, influence, and maybe even safety. Now, what people do with that desire often does stray into racism, no doubt about that, but recognising that 'it is probably worse to be fewer than to be more' does not make you an evil racist.",True,False,False,,,0,1567393957,,False,0,{},eysctcj,False,t3_c5tvi2,False,True,t3_c5tvi2,/r/unpopularopinion/comments/c5tvi2/racism_megathread/eysctcj/,False,,1575954288,3,True,[],False,unpopularopinion,t5_2tk0s,r/unpopularopinion,public,0,

If not, what does it mean? Did Napoleon really promote Meritocracy (at least in the early days and in his overall legacy)? 

Napoleon was a reactionary, someone who was against the democratic ideals of the young republic, but not like the Thermidorians who merely preferred a more moderate liberal regime than Robespierre's or the royalists who wanted to restore the ancien regime. Napoleon wanted to both go back and forward. As he so famously proclaimed, ""I am the successor, not of Louis XVI, but of Charlemagne."" The society he would establish was going to be hierarchical and anti-democratic but it was also more meritocratic, tolerant, and just than his predecessors. 

&gt;Did Napoleon really promote Meritocracy (at least in the early days and in his overall legacy)?

Yes and no. He was meritocratic in a lot of ways (and most of the ways that were probably most important to his goals) but he also was guilty of nepotism at times and this backfired pretty bad. His brothers were nowhere near as gifted as him.

&gt;Did Nietzsche also like Napoleon because he himself was a committed Pan-European Cosmopolitanist who wanted a United Europe (being opposed to nationalism)?

Yes, see aphorism 377 of *The Gay Science* and aphorism 208 of *Beyond Good and Evil*. He was a pan-European nationalist. 

&gt;What is a ‚Äúpost structuralist soft-peddler?‚Äù 

Post-structuralism is a term which covers the thinkers who critiqued (or arguably, continued) structuralism. It's not really a unified movement or school of thought but generally speaking, post-structuralists tends to deal a lot with language, the text, and the deconstruction of binaries. Post-structuralism has a lot of overlap with postmodernism. Most thinkers associated with it are/were very egalitarian and libertarian. Foucault, Derrida, and Butler are a few of the most famous. Most of them are influenced by Nietzsche but only take from his destructive side. They use the hammer he swung at Christianity, nationalism, and tradition but reject what he wanted to build atop the ruins.

&gt;What is a ‚Äúultra-reactionary 

A reactionary is one who wants to return to a previous state of society. The term comes from the Thermidorian reaction, the counter-revolution against Robespierre, but it is now generally used to refer to those with illiberal ultraconservative political beliefs. 

&gt;neo-Platonist socially?‚Äù 

Off the top of my head, I can't recall Nietzsche ever saying much about the Neoplatonists. Another user has said they think the author is comparing Nietzsche's political beliefs to those put forward in *The Republic*. That might be the case but if it is, ""neo-Platonist"" was a poor choice of words.

&gt;What is a ‚Äúneo-Machiavellian  

Well, Nietzsche did say in the chapter of *Ecce Homo* titled ""Why I Write Such Excellent Books"" that he considered Cesare Borgia to be closer to his ideal than Parsifal and Borgia was the inspiration for *The Prince*. Nietzsche wanted more artist-tyrants, leaders who could wield power with fury if they need to but also had excellent tastes in the arts. With that said, it should be noted that another man Nietzsche admired, Frederick the Great, wrote *Anti-Machiavel*, a response to *The Prince*. Frederick was an enlightened absolutist, someone who thought he as king should have unquestioned power but also be duty-bound to help his people. He saw his position as ""the first servant of the state"". Frederick was also a brilliant tactician (Napoleon visited his tomb after defeating Prussia and remarked that if Fredrick were still alive, he would not be there) as well as a gifted flute player and patron of philosophers and artists. 

&gt;synarchic 

This usually either means harmonious or some kind of conspiratorial, shadow government. I can't remember Nietzsche saying anything about his ideal ruling caste governing only in secret.

&gt;trans-national 

He wanted the unification and merging of European peoples. I wouldn't use the term trans-national because it implies being ""across nations"" instead of the coalescing of nations. 

&gt;elitist?‚Äù

He was an elitist. Nietzsche cared mostly about the cultivation of great individuals and saw the masses as incompetent, incapable of properly ruling, and mediocre.

&gt;What is a ‚Äúexpositor of ‚Äúesoteric‚Äù caste hierarchy based on culture and spirit?‚Äù

Well, he was an esoteric moralist, meaning that he did not believe that one morality fit everyone right and that great individuals should not be bound by the same codes and value systems that bind the herd. That might be what they are talking about or this could be referring again to secret government thing, which I can't recall anything about. By a caste based on culture and spirit, this is referring to Nietzsche's desire to see a new aristocracy established, one which would fit his ideal of valiant artist tyrants, geniuses of culture and war.

&gt; 
&gt; To name a single example, Marx celebrated the US conquest of Mexico, using openly racist terms to contrast the ‚Äúenergetic‚Äù Yankees with the lazy and ‚Äúprimitive‚Äù Mexicans. His idea of dialectical progress shared the element of white supremacy with the liberalism of the day. He was convinced that the Western nations were the most advanced in the world and that all the other peoples would have to emulate Europe and follow the same path to liberate themselves. As such, he was an unapologetic defender of colonialism, which he recognized as an exercise of capitalist violence, but which he also believed was vital to the progress of ‚Äúprimitive‚Äù peoples.

The historical process of fuedalism&gt;mercantalism&gt;captialism&gt;socialism&gt;communism is kind of hard to square with being anti-colonial in his era, yeah. I don't see many places in the global south leaving feudal agrarianism without colonialism...

However, just because Marx held personally racist views on some issues doesn't mean white supremacy is inherent to or expressed in Marxism

[],,[deleted],,,,,,,dark,,,,,[],"&gt;First of all is mobility. Europe geography is generally flat. In Asia and Africa, geography is a nightmare: jungle, mountains, deep gorge and river. Not to mention the vast tropical rainforest, which is a nightmare to cross. Ask the Japanese/English/French/American/Australian about their experiences. The landmass is also greater and therefore you need to travel further to find your enemy. Having a large, bronze or iron shield will not help you move very fast or for very long. Now that is not to say that they do not use iron or bronze shield: they did. This leads us to the second issue.

This is not true. Indeed, the Greek terrain where hoplites originated are noted to be particularly hilly and mountainous.

Hoplites were as much a cultural institution as it was a troop type associated with specific terrain. That's why the colonies the Greeks setup all over the Med had Hoplite-type troops, and why the Persians (who were heavily interlinked with the Greeks, rather than being distant foreign conquerors) also employed Hoplite mercenaries. Persia moreover was not some ""vast tropical rain forest"" or some other kind of geographical nightmare to cross. Indeed, it's often noted by various historians that the best forces raised by the Persians was cavalry - a troop type not well suited in the rainforest or other kinds of rough terrain, while the Greeks avoided raising cavalry precisely because the horses were more ineffective in the Greek hillsides. 

And in any case the much bigger issue is this idea that Hoplites were some awesome battle-winning formation that came to crush all other formations; a myth that originated from Hanson's ""Western Way of War"". Hoplites were in fact rarely used in open battle; as ancient-era warfare was still dominated by sieges. There is no evidence at all to suggest they would have consistently won against non-Hoplite armies; wicker shields or not.

Indeed, most battles that feature Hoplites had Hoplites fighting *on both sides* of the battlefield, so the battle was won based on specific circumstances and leadership rather than because of the superiority of the Hoplite. Meanwhile, the Hoplites lost a *lot* of battles when they faced non-Hoplite armies - most particularly against the Romans who were very familiar with this formation and developed tactics specifically tailored against it.",False,False,False,,,0,1567398426,,1567398655,0,{},eyshjnk,False,t3_cxrz0a,False,False,t1_eynp6m4,/r/WarCollege/comments/cxrz0a/how_effective_were_wicker_shields_in_the_bronze/eyshjnk/,False,,1575956538,13,True,[],False,WarCollege,t5_39t8u,r/WarCollege,public,0,True

A clinical protocol of a multidisciplinary team with mental health professionals, physicians, and surgeons, including puberty suppression, followed by cross-sex hormones and gender reassignment surgery, provides trans youth the opportunity to develop into well-functioning young adults. All showed significant improvement in their psychological health, and they had notably lower rates of internalizing psychopathology than previously reported among trans children living as their natal sex. Well-being was similar to or better than same-age young adults from the general population.

‚Ä¢ The only disorders more common among trans people are those associated with abuse and discrimination - mainly anxiety and depression.

Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Lord Rothschild -1917

The declaration hardly established a Jewish State. It was, however, followed by some colonialism and illegal immigration to Palestine. 

Michael J. Cohen wrote a book called ‚ÄúThe Origins and Evolution of the Arab-Zionist Conflict.‚Äù It discusses how, before the Balfour declaration, anti-Semitic sentiment in post-enlightenment Europe convinced many prominent Jewish thinkers that they would never be able to escape the prejudices of their gentile neighbors. He described the process by which anti-Semitic programs in Eastern Europe forced many Jews to flee to the west. These programs are believed to be one of the catalysts for what is called the Haskalah, or Jewish Enlightenment. The Haskalah split the Jewish people in two, those who believed Judaism was just their religion, and those who believed it was an ethnic identity.

Many anti-Semites seized on this opportunity to portray the Jewish people as ‚Äúother,‚Äù and encouraged the notion that the Jewish people should have their own state in Palestine. 

In, ‚ÄúOne Land, Two States: Israel and Palestine as Parallel States,‚Äù Mark Levine states: ‚ÄúThe parents of Zionism were not Judaism and tradition, but anti-semitism and nationalism.‚Äù Levine goes on to suggest that the Holocaust and several miraculous victories in Palestine over Palestinians served as a motivator for many Jewish people to embrace the nationalist identity of modern zionists (Levine p211), as up until then the movement had failed to catch much wind. 

It wasn‚Äôt until after many conflicts between settlers and the Palestinian people that, in May 14, 1948, The Jewish People‚Äôs Council declared the existence of an independent Jewish State. 

Now, to directly address your comment. I don‚Äôt know if anyone has the right to give anyone a country. Especially at such a cost to another people. The UN, most notably the USA and USSR, did just that. 

I also never made any value judgment about the worthiness of the Jewish people in any society. In fact, I was really just questioning the motives of the Europeans in facilitating and encouraging the Jewish people to leave Europe. I believe that diversity is what makes America strong. 

One final note: I am not a scholar of Jewish history. The above is weak sauce compared to all the great books written on the subject.

I wish Poles dealt with their own war crimes in a similar manner that germans did. We are so good at playing the victim card. It's like a national sport in Poland.

But overall the cost of putting lines underground is very expensive, especially in an area of high population. You have to disrupt current power and then do construction in a timely matter before people/businesses get really cheesed off. Assuming there is space for underground power, most of our construction was built with overhead power lines in mind.  


And with expense, we have to consider who is paying for it. It's not really feasible to have the entire USA pay for underground power for certain states because people will fight against increased taxes to support a totally different state. So then we have to get that money from the state that is making the changes, but can those states really pay for the construction? In the EU one entire country can focus its resources on paying and building the system for the whole country, but in the USA each state would have to pay individually. And since each state's economy varies, not every state would have the money like a single country in EU to put everything underground.   


Also underground power is not completely invulnerable to external forces. Underground power is great against weather such as strong winds and tornadoes.  But when we talk about hurricanes there is a high risk of flooding and underground power, even when properly protected, is still at a risk during floods. As other users have mentioned, the cost of repairing underground lines is expensive.  


So a lot of hurricane prone states have done a cost analysis and figured that repairing overhead lines every storm is cheaper than building and maintaining  underground lines.

1. Age and Gender - 21M

2. Location, and are you willing to relocate for a prospect? - It‚Äôs kinda complicated... California born I have family all over the US though. I‚Äôm in Europe right now too. I‚Äôve been out and about!
3. Marital Status - Single/Divorced/Children: Single. Never been with anyone.

4. Ideal marriage timeline: No preference. Maybe 2 years, but I am willing to adjust to that special someone‚Äôs timeline.

5. Age Range that you would want/require in a prospect: 20+, I have no strict preference other than for maturity. Pretty clich√© lol.

6. Five important characteristics you look for in a prospect:

I just want someone who‚Äôs good! But without making some kind of list of demands here‚Äôs what‚Äôs ‚Äúgood‚Äù to me.

Communicative - I would love to have someone who speaks her mind always
Active - I am an athlete and I would love to have someone has a love for excercise and health like me
Romantic - I love love and have thought of so many ways to treat my future wife. If someone thinks of treating me in that way too, it would make for something beautiful.
Humor - This is clich√©, but I like to make outlandish jokes, and to have someone with a pretty equally wild sense of humor, or can at least entertain it, would be great.
Patience/Understanding - It is super important that we are understanding of each-other. That is what will help us get through anything. I want someone to seek to know how I am and why I am the way I am. And I will do the same.

5. State/specify your level of religiosity: 

Sunni. I am like anyone else! Trying my best to live up to my expectations as a Muslim while also navigating this world as it is. I am not perfect, but the effort is there. I pray, and read Quran and attend the masjid.

6. Level of education, and what are you looking for? 

I am an Undergrad. 

I want an intelligent woman, but not necessarily ‚Äúhighly college educated‚Äù. That being said, my wife can be far more college educated than me, it doesn‚Äôt matter either way.

I would not judge someone for not getting a PhD. There are other ways to make money!

7. Current Job Status

Full-Time Student
Part-Time Barber
Part-Time IT Consultant
Career Path: Lawyer

8. Ethnicity, and are you more open to mixing?

West African, I am open to mixing

9. List 3 hobbies, or things you like to do in your spare time: 

I like writing/performing poetry üìù
I am big on weight training
I love cooking! 
Nature oriented activities like hiking or sailing are awesome
I also have pretty nerdy interests like music, video games, comics/superheroes, anime, etc.

Let‚Äôs geek out over something. What are your interests?

10. Add something short and interesting about you that makes you stand out!

I‚Äôve done some intense things while fasting, I‚Äôve played football games, gone on runs, went through whole training sessions, etc. so I guess I have crazy willpower.

Tuollaista uhkaa ei ole, ellei halua tuhota ymp√§rist√∂√§ tuhoamisen itsens√§ vuoksi.

EU:ssa on ruoasta kaikkialla ylituotanto, koska maataloustukia jaetaan kaikkialla. My√∂s Suomessa on merkitt√§v√§ ylituotanto. Sianlihasta taidetaan vied√§ suuri osa ulos maasta eli hy√∂ty valuu lihayhti√∂ille ja veronmaksajat maksavat tuet, jotka aiheuttavat matalan hinnan.

EU pystyisi varmaankin helposti ruokkimaan ainakin tuplam√§√§r√§n ihmisi√§ jos lihaa vaihdetaan osaksi ekologisiin kasviksiin. Muutama kymmenen miljoonaa suuta menisi pelk√§ll√§ nykyisell√§kin ylituotannolla.

Lis√§ksi l√§nsimaisesta ylituotannosta k√§rsiv√§t my√∂s kehittyv√§t maat ja niiden oma ruokahuolto: L√§nsimaiden ylituotanto myyd√§√§n kehittyviin maihin ja siell√§ maatalouden edellytykset heikentyv√§t, koska l√§nsimaiden dumppaama ylituotantoruoka on halpaa. Kehittym√§t√∂n maatalous altistaa helpommin my√∂s n√§l√§nh√§d√§lle. L√§nsimaiden ylituotanto saattaa olla jopa osasyyn√§ tuleviin ongelmiin.

Ilmastopakolaisista on varmasti kaikenlaista haittaa, mutta ruokaa on varmasti jos ei tee tyhmyyksi√§. Nykyiset peltoalat pystyv√§t ruokkimaan 10-14 miljardia ihmist√§ jos osa lihasta vaihdetaan kasviksiin.

1. Sure the government has tried to carry out Brexit. Labour, the Lib Dems, and the rest of parliament have consistently blocked it. They don't want the deal, they don't want no deal. Perhaps they have no responsibility to the country?

2. &gt;referendum are advisory and elections are legally binding

I'm sure you know that the government offered a referendum on the basis that it was 'once in a lifetime' and that they would abide by the result. People voted on that basis and afterwards even Corbyn and the rest of the house (bar LDs) stated that they would abide by the result. But I guess because its a result you don't like then they don't have to.

3. As you've stated 70% of our food has nothing to do with the EU. The 30% that does is mostly replaceable by things that don't. Even then, your whole argument is based on OUR government applying an import tax. Why should we do that? We don't have a tax at the moment, so you think that the day we leave it becomes what? 20%? That's not how WTO works - we apply the rate to our imports, they apply the rate to our exports. Therefore your predictions on price rises are completely arbitrary. We won't have to check lorry loads of imports since we know the EU regulations stand ie there'll be no change to what we buy from the EU unless we decide to change it.

4. The reason minimum wage hasn't caught up to inflation is exactly why we need to stop FoM. Thanks for making that point for me. Without a regular supply of cheap labour from Eastern Europe, wages will rise to at least match inflation, because British workers demand a living wage and less of the money goes abroad to support families in poorer countries.

5. I think the best thing you said was that during the financial crises the value of the pound dropped 21%. Well guess what? Everyone survived! If that's the level of disaster we face where big business suffers and the normal person simply has to buy British because its too expensive to buy from abroad then fine. Absolutely fine, and good for the local economy.

6. The EU is a machine designed to speed up the transition of money to the top.

But pedantry aside...

It is really difficult to speak about equal rights, because back in the day society wasn't just divided along the lines of sex, but class too. Sure, men in many nations had a bit of an advantage - for example, in certain countries as time progressed, wealthy male non-noble merchants got the vote earlier, but that's just one right of many. The idea of fundamental human rights is a relatively new one, and one that's not completely realised even today, much less 100 years ago. And breaking down equality ot the right to vote is kind of simplistic. 

But let's look at the right to vote. America's an exception, but if you look at European nations - say, the UK. There's a buttload of info about women's suffrage, but men's... not so much. In fact, search for men's rights, and you get women's rights. So no wonder gullible young girls with little understanding of history (especially since it is taught through a feminist lens) get the impression that men always had the right to vote. Or they just never think about it. 

So, when did men get the right to vote in the UK? Well...

In 1866, in order to vote in Britain, you had to be a noble (male of female), or a man of 21 years of age... who owner real estate. Funny how that goes. For reference, this meant 1.4 of the 30 million population. So really, 91% of men still couldn't vote. 

They increased the voting right to 18% of the population by 1884, but that's still based on property. 

And finally, meg got the universal vote in 1918, as a compensation for their service in WW1. This act also gave the vote to women who were over 30, and owner property, or whose husband owner property. That's a pretty big chunk of the female population. 

THen in 1928 women too got the right universally. 

So really the difference between unalienable women's suffrage and men's suffrage was barely 10 years. Doesn't sound like ""centuries of oppression"" to me...

&amp;#x200B;

In the post-colonial era the rise of anti-communism in the west meant that decolonialisation had to be rethought. Each country adopted slightly different approaches, with France generally remaining the most involved with their ex-colonies, hence French troops defending Mali from terrorists.

In the Belgian case, they had no hope of retaining their colonies. /u/AbjectStress has given a pr√©cis of Belgian actions in the Congo. Essentially, rather than retain the whole country - an impossibility - through a puppet regime, events escalated and Belgium pulled out very abruptly, causing chaos.

At the same time, Katanga, a province administered separately with great mineral wealth tried to secede from the Congo with tacit Belgian support. And the CIA tacitly supported the Belgians tacit support.

Katanga retains valuable mineral deposits which were best kept out of communist hands, as far as the West was concerned. The UN were involved in this part of the conflict.

&gt; LONDON - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is laying an election &amp;quot;Elephant trap&amp;quot; for the opposition Labour Party that it should avoid, former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair warned on Monday.

&gt; &amp;quot;Boris Johnson knows that if no-deal Brexit stands on its own as a proposition it might well fail but if he mixes it up with the Corbyn question in a general election he could succeed despite a majority being against a no-deal Brexit because some may fear a Corbyn premiership more,&amp;quot; Blair said.

&gt; Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn &amp;quot;Should see an election before Brexit is decided for the elephant trap it is,&amp;quot; he said.

 Ao fazer um curso para empreendedores, Monica Segre, 60, dona da loja de vinhos Via Vinum, percebeu que poderia negociar e diminuir suas despesas com contador, internet e transporte. 

 J√° o investimento em um software foi o que possibilitou uma economia de 8% no gasto com compras da Sampa Foods, empresa que faz eventos gastron√¥micos e gest√£o de restaurantes em S√£o Paulo e em Foz do Igua√ßu, no Paran√°. 

 ‚ÄúA plataforma nos ajudou a fazer uma compra mais racional‚Äù, diz o diretor da empresa, Leandro Camini, 33.

 Para a corretora digital Monetus, de Belo Horizonte, o que fez diferen√ßa foi sair de um im√≥vel com um aluguel caro para um mais barato, afirma Vin√≠cius Soares, 24, fundador da startup.

 E mudan√ßas no uso de telefonia e energia el√©trica ajudaram a salvar de uma crise a Gigatron Franchising, desenvolvedora de software para varejista, segundo o diretor-executivo da companhia Marcelo Salom√£o, 41.

 A seguir, veja o depoimento dos quatro empres√°rios.

### ‚ÄòAt√© uma caneta jogada fora j√° √© um gasto extra‚Äô

 Monica Segre, dona da loja de vinhos Via Vinum

 Vinho √© uma coisa maluca. Os consumidores sempre pesquisam pre√ßo e escolhem qual v√£o comprar por uma diferen√ßa de um real. 

 Se eu colocar o meu valor mais alto, n√£o vai vender. N√£o importam os meus custos, o pre√ßo tem que ser o mesmo que o dos concorrentes, n√£o adianta. Ent√£o, preciso sempre estar atenta √†s despesas.

 Desde maio, estou fazendo um curso no Sebrae. Depois de assistir √†s aulas de administra√ß√£o financeira, percebi que, al√©m de todo o esfor√ßo que eu j√° fazia para reduzir custos, ainda tinha muito mais que dava para fazer.

 Percebi que mesmo um valor que parece pequeno j√° faz diferen√ßa. Uma caneta jogada fora j√° √© um gasto. Ent√£o, eu comecei a analisar item por item para entender o que poderia ser cortado.

 Fui atr√°s da operadora de telefonia para conseguir um plano mais vantajoso de internet e telefone. Se a gente n√£o negocia, eles d√£o a op√ß√£o que querem. Passei duas horas no telefone e consegui cortar uma taxa de R$ 60.

 No curso, tamb√©m vi que outras empresas pagavam menos para o contador. Negociei com o profissional, que concordou em reduzir o pagamento em 5%. 

 Al√©m disso, revisamos a nossa log√≠stica de ecommerce. Na cidade de S√£o Paulo, trocamos a transportadora (que ainda leva os nossos produtos para o resto do pa√≠s) por uma empresa de entregas via aplicativo. 

 Antes, a gente pagava frete de R$ 28 para qualquer bairro da capital. Agora, o valor varia de R$ 10 a R$ 17 para os lugares mais pr√≥ximos. Como oferecemos entrega gr√°tis nas compras acima de R$ 500 dentro da cidade, isso tem feito diferen√ßa.

 Com todas essas iniciativas, estou conseguindo economizar at√© R$ 3.000 por m√™s. √â um dinheiro que vou poder investir aqui dentro.

 O curso e o contato com outros empres√°rios abriram meus olhos. N√£o d√° para ficarmos fechados no nosso neg√≥cio, temos que sempre circular por a√≠ e trocar ideias.

 ### ‚ÄòA tecnologia ajuda a economizar, mas sozinha n√£o resolve‚Äô

 Leandro Camini, diretor da Sampa Foods

 No nosso restaurante em Foz do Igua√ßu, t√≠nhamos um profissional para fazer as compras. Num deslize dele, descobrimos que desviava produtos. Trocamos por um novo comprador, que, por sua vez, n√£o era t√£o eficiente.

 √â um setor muito complicado. Para fazer boas compras, seria preciso ter uma equipe inteira. Mas um restaurante n√£o tem como pagar por isso.

 Num curso, descobri a CMV, uma plataforma de gest√£o de compras, que faz a cota√ß√£o de todos os insumos com os fornecedores. O gerente e a nutricionista s√≥ colocam a lista de produtos no sistema e fazem o acompanhamento.

 Tamb√©m ficou mais f√°cil controlar o que √© comprado por fora. Antes, tinha essa coisa de ir ao mercadinho pegar algum ingrediente que ficava faltando. Hoje, conseguimos planejar melhor o card√°pio e coibir essa pr√°tica.

 Com isso, conseguimos uma economia de 8% nas compras. Para usar o software, pagamos uma mensalidade de R$ 890 para cada restaurante.

 A tecnologia ajuda a reduzir custos, mas sozinha n√£o resolve nada. Antes [de receber uma plataforma](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mpme/2019/02/softwares-auxiliam-pequenos-empresarios-a-gerir-contas.shtml), √© preciso formatar as opera√ß√µes, se n√£o ela vira s√≥ mais uma burocracia. Se a empresa estiver desorganizada, vai jogar dinheiro fora. 

 ### ‚ÄòUma startup n√£o precisa ter piso de m√°rmore‚Äô

 Vin√≠cius Soares, fundador da Monetus

 Come√ßamos em um escrit√≥rio que divid√≠amos com outros empreendedores, no centro de Belo Horizonte. O valor total do aluguel era R$ 30 mil, n√≥s pag√°vamos R$ 8.000.

 Fomos crescendo no mundo digital. A√≠ percebemos que est√°vamos recebendo cada vez menos visitas de clientes. Ent√£o, decidimos achar uma estrutura mais enxuta. 

 O espa√ßo era t√£o grande que a conta de ar-condicionado do andar inteiro ficava em torno de R$ 5.000. S√≥ a minha empresa pagava cerca de R$ 1.500. 

 Durante um m√™s, pesquisamos lugares na regi√£o central. Se a gente pegasse um im√≥vel mais distante, os funcion√°rios teriam que fazer viagens longas de √¥nibus, o que daria uma grande perda de produtividade, porque as pessoas j√° chegariam cansadas.

 Encontramos um andar com 200 metros quadrados e, depois de negociar com o dono, fechamos um aluguel de R$ 2.500, com um prazo de seis meses para come√ßar a pagar. Isso porque tivemos de fazer uma reforma de R$ 20 mil.

 O espa√ßo √© inferior ao que a gente estava antes, que tinha at√© piso de m√°rmore. Mas [uma startup](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mpme/2019/04/antes-de-montar-startup-e-preciso-identificar-problema-e-testar-ideia.shtml) n√£o precisa disso, pode ter qualquer tipo de piso.

 Para reduzir ainda mais os custos, h√° seis meses, estamos dividindo o escrit√≥rio com outra empresa, que paga metade do aluguel.

 Muitas vezes, partimos do pressuposto de que, para abrir uma empresa, √© preciso ter uma superestrutura. A gente v√™ um monte de startups com mesa de sinuca, piscina de bolinha e escorregador. Mas, quando a gente est√° no come√ßo, o foco n√£o √© esse. Temos que fazer mais com menos.

 ### ‚ÄòConseguimos uma redu√ß√£o de 91% nos gastos de telefonia‚Äô

 Marcelo Salom√£o, diretor-executivo da Gigatron

 Em 2017, tivemos um problema que comprometeu 80% da receita. Para sobreviver, demitimos 150 funcion√°rios. Ficamos com 70.

 Al√©m disso, precisamos cortar todos os tipos de despesas. A redu√ß√£o mais significativa foi nos custos de telefonia. Hav√≠amos feito, em 2016, um investimento em uma central que gravava as liga√ß√µes. Eu gastava at√© R$ 4.000 por m√™s para manter essa estrutura.

 Agora, temos seis celulares pr√©-pagos, que s√£o compartilhados. Descobrimos que n√£o precis√°vamos de tudo aquilo, aplicativos supriram bem nossas necessidades. Por exemplo, compramos por R$ 3,90 uma ferramenta que grava as liga√ß√µes. Assim, conseguimos uma redu√ß√£o de 91% nos gastos de telefonia.

 Al√©m disso, realocamos a equipe dentro do nosso escrit√≥rio, um pr√©dio de 530 metros quadrados em Birigui, no interior de S√£o Paulo. Antes, os funcion√°rios ficavam divididos em seis salas. Reunimos todos em apenas duas, o que gerou uma economia de luz e ar-condicionado.

 Tudo o que fizemos virou h√°bito. Mesmo com a empresa podendo pagar, vamos manter as mudan√ßas. De uns tr√™s meses para c√°, j√° come√ßamos uma retomada de caixa.

After exit, even the opening of any trade negotiation requires unanimity amongst the 27. The preconditions the 27 would set are already obvious and we would during the election campaign have heard repeatedly from the Prime Minister ‚Äì indeed, we already have ‚Äì that he would not accede to any of them. In which case, no trade negotiation will even commence.

This would not be a short-term phenomenon. Businesses would react accordingly. As I say, they have no choice.

On ‚Äòmini deals‚Äô, the reality is, as UK officials have already long experienced, that the legislation the 27 put in place to govern economic relations with the UK after a disorderly exit has not even been up for consultation with us, let alone negotiated.

These are not ‚Äòdeals‚Äô. ‚ÄòDeals‚Äô by definition require negotiation and compromises. These are faits accomplis, set solely in the interests of the 27 by the 27, in both their content and longevity. This is not the UK in any sense ‚Äòtaking back control‚Äô but forfeiting it entirely. Campaign slogans are fine. But they are not a policy.

This EU legislation would not, to be clear, deliver economic armageddon to the UK. It is not in the EU‚Äôs interests to bring all trade to a halt, or make arrangements punitive. We do not, mercifully, live in the era of Napoleonic War blockades. But the arrangements, sector by sector, would fall very far short of what could be achieved even in a modestly ambitious FTA.

And for UK businesses, they will be uncertain, provisional, and open to adverse revision ‚Äì solely by the other side, where the UK is not present. Faced with a more belligerent UK which has chosen to walk, the EU has every interest in keeping the pressure on by making these arrangements asymmetrical and highly suboptimal for UK interests.

And, let‚Äôs be clear: EU regulators across many sectors will press firms after a ‚Äòno deal‚Äô to comply with their requirements about location and ownership. The UK will ‚Äì immediately ‚Äì face tough choices about whether to counter that with reciprocation, which moves us away from a tradition of openness I hope we would maintain, or whether to remain open and risk losing substantially by sticking to our principles.

The EU will assuredly not hold back in a ‚Äòno deal‚Äô scenario, in forcing those issues.

But in doing so, it would of course further exacerbate the increasing tensions in EU-UK relations, and make it more likely that the current breach becomes a permanent rift within the West. Both sides of the Channel are in my view really far too blas√© about that prospect.

The EU is wholly within its rights to defend its interests and the integrity of its legal order. As I say, it cannot be expected to change its principles and club rules for an exiting state. If we actively want to be a fairly distant ‚Äòthird country‚Äô on sovereignty grounds we can scarcely complain that the EU applies to us what it applies to others in the same category.

But the EU‚Äôs relationship with the UK has geostrategic implications. This is no ordinary trade nerd process. And the almost wholly technocratic Article 50 process has led to persistent strategic myopia from the EU, not just confusion and incompetence from the UK.

If the Prime Minister is serious about a post-Brexit vision in which the UK concludes a multiplicity of bilateral free trade deals, both with all major trade  blocs and with emerging markets, he knows as well as anyone that:

All these deals will take some years to negotiate. If they are to have any serious economic value for the UK, they will entail difficult compromises. Trade negotiations are not sentimental seminars full of economic liberals: and that applies just as much, if not more, to negotiations with the US, let alone China and India. No trade deal will ever be agreed by any of those partners, without delivering major economic dividends for them. I favour negotiating such deals post Brexit, but it is already long past time to be honest with the public about the dividends other superpowers will demand are put on the negotiating table.
Much more of our trade is, and will be for the foreseeable future, with our neighbouring bloc ‚Äì notably in services, in which the UK is highly competitive and all cross-border trade liberalisation is immensely difficult, precisely because it inevitably impinges heavily on domestic regulatory sovereignty. We export more services to the EU than to our next eight markets put together, because, for all its many deficiencies, the EU has made more progress in liberalising services trade than any other bloc in the world. Those patterns can, should and will change over time. But not hugely more abruptly than they have while we were in the EU. My experience tells me that the Prime Minister will very soon discover, should he ever manage to start a trade negotiation with the EU, that in practice he wants vastly better market access in the EU on services than Canada (which does a small fraction of our volume of trade with the EU). As with his predecessor, red lines will fade inexorably to pale pink as reality bites. The sooner the public hears some honesty about the trade-offs, the less furious it will be when they emerge.
It consequently makes absolutely no sense whatsoever to have a lattice work of preferential deals which excludes the EU. If we do not want to live with WTO-only commitments with the US, Japan, Canada, Korea and others, that must apply also to the EU.
Any abrupt ‚Äòno deal‚Äô exit would constitute a genuinely major supply shock to the UK, and would oblige us to negotiate post exit from a position in which the negotiating baseline ‚Äì which will be in operation in the real world of commerce ‚Äì will be no preferential deal. The pressure of the ticking clock will therefore be on the UK: precisely the same trap into which Theresa May fell so spectacularly on Article 50. Any government minister who believes the EU would not exploit that leverage to force better terms has clearly not been paying attention for the last three years. Any minister who believes that ‚Äòno deal‚Äô improves the UK‚Äôs negotiating leverage for the next, crucial, phase, does not understand trade negotiations.
The EU knows all of this too. Which is why the briefings that the EU is rattled because it knows it finally faces someone with the cojones to walk away is fine for domestic press consumption but gets more of a shrug outside the UK. Sure: the EU believes the risk of a ‚Äòdisorderly Brexit‚Äô has risen even further in recent weeks. Most see it as a majority chance. Some as a near certainty.

But the mistake I am afraid the Prime Minister is making is to believe that, because they believe that, he is likely to get some materially different and better deal than his predecessor. My instinct is that they conclude from recent events that his primary objective is to win an election by reunifying the right and squeezing the Brexit party.

In which case, delivering a ‚Äòno deal‚Äô Brexit, or committing unequivocally to it in an election manifesto and trying to keep the Remain side of British politics split for that election will be the Prime Minister‚Äôs aim, regardless of the revisions the EU offers him on the Political Declaration or examining the alternative arrangements to the backstop. Indeed anything offered to the Prime Minister would have to be loudly declared insufficient and an indication of EU intransigence, or the strategy does not work. If that is one‚Äôs analysis, then one of course politely expresses enormous interest in urgently seeing new concrete legal ideas in print from the UK, but one does not hold one‚Äôs breath.

That EU politeness is of course being oversold here pre-prorogation as indicating new openness to non-backstop solutions. ‚ÄòDo not damage my hand, just as my tough new approach is making progress‚Äô. It is appreciably more likely that it is a careful blame avoidance strategy from the EU.

Both sides now have just one final chance in the coming weeks to draw back from the brink, and not reconcile themselves to this now being simply a blame, or blame avoidance, game. Seen from my seat it looks most improbable that they will. It will require courage, creativity and compromise. And the political market for those may be exhausted by both sides.

But if we do lurch to ‚Äòno deal‚Äô it will not, I am afraid, be some easy rapid patching up of reasonably amicable relations after an election, and smooth progress towards a fairly ambitious free trading and security relationship.

It will much more likely be a fractious, potentially quite seriously conflicting relationship, in which, for years, not months, the UK lives on much worse trading terms with the EU than most of the developed world. Trading terms which will depend overwhelmingly on decisions taken in rooms where no Brit is present. In which trading tensions will inevitably spill over into other areas of cooperation, of which there ought, at this time, to be legions, because the appetite will wither on both sides. This is bad for all.

Former colleagues on both sides of the Channel talk with some foreboding of a potentially lengthy deep freeze in cross-Channel relations as these tensions mount and the incentives to cooperate diminish.

Some people definitely take it too far, but that's on both sides of the fence. Me personally, I openly talk about my diet and my own views on weight - but mutual respect for someone's choices is important. If they're completely aware of their actions, that will likely have a major impact on them later in life - who am I to say they should be doing otherwise? It *is* their body, shame as it is to see someone less able than others based on their choices - that's when I start to find it absurd, if it's at a point where you can't even go to work, or to the store. Whatever. If you're overweight, but don't let it stop you from doing those everyday things - that's all that matters from a public perspective.

I think high streets should have more plus-size specified stores (At least in Europe). At the moment you have like, Jacamo and...? Some of my friends are diabetic through genes, despite having a healthy diet their whole lives, the diagnosis was inevitable and their weight still suffers from the condition. It's unfair to tie some like that who can't help themselves under the same brush as those who kinda made the problem. Those people actually struggle to find clothes to match their body and I wouldn't even call them obese... more like overweight

I'm not saying we should be accepting to people who take advantage of the system, or act as if they're being oppressed by society as a whole. It's only ever if its at a point where those everyday chores becomes impossible and it becomes beyond a social norm that society has a judgement. I think acceptance for overweight rather than obese would be great, especially for men. Women have a lot of plus-sized models and so on to inspire, whereas there's still a lot of insecurity for men in that shape.

I used to be overweight 10 or so years ago and some assumptions and judgements people give you - which do still exist, are totally uncalled for.

Fact that Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs squad have become self-policing displays their new-found mean streak that echoes back to the glory days of Dalglish and Souness

Sadio Mane was right to get annoyed with Mohamed Salah when the Egyptian did not pass the ball his way in Liverpool‚Äôs 3-0 victory over Burnley on Saturday.

Mane was furious when he was substituted. The Senegalese believed that he could have added a fourth goal if the ball had been laid off in his direction.

Equally, Salah was within his rights to shoot. He has earned the chance to try his luck with his goalscoring exploits ‚Äì 57 in 78 Premier League matches.

Jurgen Klopp will be delighted with Mane‚Äôs reaction. It shows that the team‚Äôs killer instinct is still sharpening. Even the stars of the side are being held to account by their team-mates, a characteristic of the very best Liverpool sides over the years.


When Klopp took over at Anfield there was a feeling that the team were not tough enough. They could be bullied by opponents and took setbacks too easily for their manager‚Äôs liking. Graeme Souness called Arsene Wenger‚Äôs Arsenal ‚Äúa team of son-in-laws,‚Äù suggesting that the squad at the Emirates were too nice. Similar insults could be applied to Liverpool.



Klopp‚Äôs team are no longer a soft touch. They hold each other to account. When a mistake on the field is made, the disapproval of colleagues can be even more cutting than the criticism of a manager. Mane‚Äôs outburst shows that Liverpool have reached the point where the players are self-policing. It is a great place to be.


Salah and Mane have a good friendship. It shows in their interactions on the pitch. That should not stop them pushing each other in private or public.

Sometimes even bad relationships are good for the team. Daniel Sturridge and Luis Suarez did not get on. The rivalry pushed both players to try and outdo the other. The 2013-14 season was the most productive of the Englishman‚Äôs career as he strove to outscore his fellow forward. The uneasy partnership almost fired Liverpool to the title.

Traditionally, players at Anfield were encouraged to let those around them know if they were not maintaining the required standard. Under Bob Paisley and Joe Fagan in the 1980s, the dressing room was controlled by Kenny Dalglish and his fellow Scots Souness and Alan Hansen. Any sign of weakness on the pitch was pounced upon and called out. If things were going wrong no one was immune to criticism. ‚ÄúIf you were tired, not contributing or slacking, they didn‚Äôt want to know you,‚Äù Craig Johnston, the Australian midfielder, said. ‚ÄúThey kept everyone in line. They kept the rest of the team professional. They were savage about getting the job done in the most direct way.‚Äù

They would approve of Mane‚Äôs approach.


Dalglish and Souness were ‚Äì and remain ‚Äì close mates but when Liverpool reached half-time 3-0 down to Coventry City at Highfield Road in December 1983, the bonds of friendship were severely tested.

The dressing room was in uproar with Alan Kennedy, the left back, the main focus for criticism but Souness ‚Äì whose nickname was ‚ÄòChampagne Charlie‚Äô ‚Äì began rowing with Dalglish. ‚ÄúIt went out of control,‚Äù Johnston said. ‚ÄúKenny and Charlie were going for it. It started over something small, like ‚Äòyou didn‚Äôt pass to me, you greedy bastard,‚Äô and blew up. I‚Äôd never seen anything like it before or since. The big beasts went for each other. It was excellent viewing.‚Äù


The spat was quickly forgotten. Liverpool ended up losing 4-0 that day but went on to win the title, the League Cup and the European Cup that season.

Johnston‚Äôs amusement was echoed by Roberto Firmino‚Äôs at Turf Moor. The Brazilian was acting as a peacemaker but it was clear Firmino could see the funny side of the situation. Everyone connected with the team will have a laugh about what happened but no one will want to be on the receiving end of a similar reaction.

Mane's frustration continued as he left the field (Reuters)
Liverpool have developed a mean streak in the past two years. Their response to losing the Champions League final to Real Madrid last year was anger. No one wanted to suffer another defeat like Kiev. They have become more mean-eyed and clinical. One of the signature moments in the semi-final against Barcelona came in the second leg at Anfield. With Liverpool three goals down, Andy Robertson bundled over Lionel Messi and then rubbed the Argentinian‚Äôs head in mockery. Robertson showed absolutely no respect for the world‚Äôs best player and the contemptuous act enlivened the Kop as much as any goal in the 4-0 win.

Klopp‚Äôs team are becoming a different animal. They are up for a scrap ‚Äì even if it is between themselves if someone does not reach the heights that are demanded. No one can complain if Salah shoots but he needs to score. If he misses he cannot moan if Mane ‚Äì or anyone else ‚Äì lets him know he needs to do better.

Although its labelled as the ""KR ranger build"" its literally the same build top players in (at least EU, I dont follow NA too much) played already. The top EU players are also well connected and active in each others chats hence you get very nice discussions from time to time. In their eyes the ""kr ranger"" was suboptimal in the, back then, noble and brawler dominated meta (which was not as dominant in KR and people played more ranger and assassin).

We only got a small overlay between KR ranger popping up and the ""end"" of nobles and brawler dominance, so we will never know what the better comp was. With rangers being untouched they were the build that remained. But to say that KR invented the ranger build is just wrong, it was just way more popular in KR as western top players referred nobles and brawler comps. But itself the KR meta was as stale as the one in the west.

To counter the ""but KR figured out that rangers work in patch X"" - yeah, rangers even got buffed from when it was already successful in the west, so it wasnt too hard to figure out it would be good. Nobles just got overbuffed which made rangers shine less.

The moment some top streamers in a specific region start to play comp X, it will cause a major portion of the region the copy it even though it might not be the most effective one.
