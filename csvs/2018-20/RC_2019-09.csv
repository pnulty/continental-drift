It boils down to, the growth only significantly changes if you tax households. Yang's primary funding comes from a VAT tax on corporations.

As long as we can agree that the 12.5 percent growth rate is not applicable in this case.  According to the study, that only happens if you borrow all the money.

With the format you're proposing there would be very little point to the regular season and most teams would be completely slacking off, especially a team like G2 who basically trolls at the moment the second they're guaranteed top 2.

I guess that's because I'm European and a fan of football, but I definitely value consistency over the entire regular season over a playoffs system.

  ""Se a Europa n√£o puder respeitar seus compromissos, o Ir√£ passar√° √† terceira etapa na redu√ß√£o dos compromissos adotados com o JCPOA (sigla em ingl√™s do acordo chamado Plano Integral de A√ß√£o Conjunta)"", disse Rohani a Macron, segundo o portal do governo iraniano.

I mostly agree with Snagalip above: George really did have something special, and maybe thematically it was intact, but what he had was in rough form. He remixed his material many times on the way to processing it into a story. Part of that process involved layering over literal movies (yes Japanese samurai films, though I'm not sure that Hidden Fortress was actually quite as much of an influence as it's usually reported... but definitely The Dam Busters for the WW2 rhythms of the Trench Run). 

His 'marketing copy' did very much change over time, though, and while what he said always 'may have been true from a certain point of view' (I agree that he probably wasn't outright lying, at least in his own mind), it wasn't usually reported as 'George has some rough ideas that have been stewing in his head since a kid' but (and most especially in the Prequel era) 'George has and has always had one very specific and definite plan - quit yer complainin and sit down and just wait for The Plan'. (Where have we heard that one recently?) Problem is, what that definite plan *was* kept changing.

And unfortunately, it was in the Prequel era where George *most* needed the fans who had followed him since 1977 to feel that he was being fully open and honest with them, because his films were very disappointing (MUCH worse than the EU materials coming from his own companies at the same time, including the games) and they were losing trust, and... right when he most needed to be trustworthy, he kinda wasn't. He just kept trying to rewrite history and try to pretend nothing had ever changed. Starting with the Special Editions and never making the original theatrical cuts available. It was just this constant sense, 1997 to 2007, of 'slippery old George, you just can't take him at his word'. And, well. We couldn't. 

(And that's why projects like Secret History appeared, trying to riddle out the TRUTH about how Star Wars was made and whatever happened to that amazing Prequels story he'd supposedly had plotted out forever, because George was NOT giving us the truth. He was giving us Slightly Truth Flavoured Product.)

And Lucasfilm after George, sadly, has kept up that tradition of rewriting history to cast themselves as heroes against a horde of disappointed fans.. but doubled and tripled down on it.

Disney LOVES to complain about how 'Star Wars has the most toxic fan base', but that's because Star Wars has the most *passionate and committed* fan base... and also the worst quality drop in official products compared to fan products. And the fans notice when things that cost billions of dollars are worse than things they make themselves for free.

It did not. 

Objectively so. 

You are completely wrong - there was a Commons majority for Attlee‚Äôs plans but the HoL wanted to delay them. 

The law in place was that the HoL could delay by three sessions over two years, so the prorogation happened in order to create an extra session and reduce the delay that the Lords could cause. 

It did not sideline the HoC. 

&gt; So does Borris.

No, Boris has a Commons majority against his plans which is why he‚Äôs trying to sideline the Commons. Attlee has a Commons majority in favour. In fact arguably Attlee was *strengthening* the power of the Commons by reducing the potential for delay from the Lords. 

&gt; No it's extremely similar. Atlee abused the suspension of parliament to force through his reforms against the political system of the UK. Borris is abusing the suspension of parliament to help prevent parliament stopping Britain leaving the EU on the 31st of October. Just because you hate Brexit doesn't make what Borris did any worse than Atlee

I have quite clearly explained the key differences between them. Attlee did not sideline the Commons in any way shape or form, he merely reduced the potential for delays from the Lords. 

&gt; But it has happened before. And the sky didn't fall in. Unless you're claiming both Atlee and Major led ""coups"" in their own time

[],,LapsarianLiving,,,,[],,,,text,t2_4b7qv83z,False,False,[],"The crusades were a really complicated time for a couple reasons. 

For one, I am a confessional Presbyterian, so we reject the Pope's authority. In fact, anyone who claims to possess an office of papacy, [our doctrinal standards call an ""antichrist""](http://www.reformation21.org/confession/2013/07/chapter-256.php) on the grounds that he functionally serves as a rival to Christ's claim to be head of the church. The middle ages were a time of notorious corruption of the church and one of the main reasons the reformation needed to happen. 

At the same time, the historical situation was really unique. After the fall of the Western Roman empire, the threat of banditry became so severe that Europe descended into feudalism, which meant that there was very little concentration of power outside of the local Lords. There were also a lot of medieval disputes about the relationship between the power of the church and the state. There were debates about whether the state appointed bishops or the church validated the existence of the state. There is even [a forged document called the Donation of Constantine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donation_of_Constantine) where he supposedly gave full civil authority to the Pope. During this time, the Popes filled the power vacuums and called for crusades.

However, you have to understand that the political turmoil in Europe, and the advent of the climate/sanitation/livestock/rat driven plagues that decimated Europe, when Islam came on the scene they had outright religious wars of conquest and were spreading their territory even as far as Spain.  Honestly, when Muslims complain about the Crusades, I really want to whip out my tiny violin to play my song of tiny sympathy, because essentially they got mad that the Pope fought them back.

At the same time, the Crusades were really bad for more reasons than that. For one, they conquered Jerusalem for no apparent reason, when the war was basically against other Christians, the wars themselves fit into the terrible sacramental system they had fabricated where people could be forgiven of sins by going on pilgrimages, touching relics, or going on missions from the Pope.

Yes, but I don't see anyone actually protesting this in the scale people turn out for white nationalism or ""straight pride"" crap. The last time it kind of happened was in the Occupy movement, and even that ended up not doing much of anything. I just don't see the majority of the population being as worked up about COL or wages as socialists claim. (Except maybe on healthcare or college costs, but even then, not that much.)

And the people who are actually producing unrest and protesting are not doing so on economic grounds! All the biggest marches and protests are either for the environment, women's/minority rights, or reactionary bullshit from the other side.

&gt; Many have no choice to live way beyond their means because sprawling suburbs and urban areas designed when oil was cheap and thought to be infinite don't lend themselves to public transit or being healthy communities. Changing this urban nightmare situation most people live in will take something on the scale of a New Deal. 

If what you're selling is ""let's make more public transit and build a ton of housing"", then yeah, I'm all for that. But you're going to have to offset the fiscal expansion needed for all this with *some* thing, or it's going to be massively inflationary (and also polluting since you're not touching carbon costs).

&gt; Read Capital in the 21st Century because I know I'm not going to be able to get you to read anything to the left of that. 

:( for your information, I've read Caliban and the Witch, which was pretty lefty, and one of these days I'll get around to finishing that damn bread book you lot keep insisting on. But okay, that one seems interesting so I will add it to my list.

I have several objections to the following paragraphs you've written, but I will withhold them for now, since I assume that book will get more in-depth about it.

&gt; White people are the loudest and most vitriolic group because they've lost the most by losing privilege. People tend to get more nationalistic and xenophobic when when they feel like their piece of the pie is shrinking. This is really nothing new. 

&gt; The only reason something hasn't snapped already is because we're so efficient at production that a lack of material wealth isn't going to cause people to snap like it did in the path, the contradictions inherent to life under this system and a lack of political agency will. Again, I don't think right-wing populism comes out of a vacuum. 

I mean, I don't either? I think they've been used to being in power for literally millennia, and the end of that is what's making them feel (rightly) threatened. In the past, poor men with few prospects could rely on having a wife to rule over since women were mostly incapable of supporting themselves. That's no longer true, and since they have no one left to oppress they seek to blame others for their own failings.

&gt; Individual blame is a scapegoat. You're assuming people have a choice when they don't. I think you're showing a lot of privilege here by saying such a thing. 

&gt; Most poor people can't afford to be vegetarian, it's far cheaper to buy junk food in bulk at places like Wal-Mart. These same people have to drive because there is no public transit where they live or it takes 2-3x as long which is a deal breaker when you're working 60+ hours a week and trying to raise a family. On top of that, rent and other expenses keep increasing while wages stay the same or decline if we're talking about the US where minimum wage hikes to keep pace with inflation are a political football. 

I'm not blaming individuals. But junk food is cheap because its true costs are hidden and externalized. By forcing people to assume those costs (in food, transport, and elsewhere) there would *have* to be much higher pressure on companies to raise wages, as the current options are priced out and minimum wage doesn't cut it anymore.

(I also think you'd be surprised at how cheap vegetables can be. I'm not talking kale, but more rice, beans and legumes in general. Options that are ignored by poorer consumers because meat and junk food is also cheap and they are culturally conditioned to prefer it.)

&gt; Imagine it's WW2 and people decide to sit back and wait for the free market to build its own army to go liberate their assets in continental Europe. That's what it feels like you're arguing for when you argue against things like the GND for me.

My problem with the GND is that it is sold as an all-encompassing solution but it does not address the issue at its roots. If it had a carbon tax (preferably large enough to offset the increase in consumption) and it was coupled with global-scale action (like pushing a carbon tax at the international level, paying developing countries to build renewables/nuclear instead of coal/gas, etc), then I would be for it.

And I also think that you can't sell the GND to the white working class. They've been utterly captured by right-wing propaganda to a degree where they fight against their own interests (like retraining, or some of the Sanders policy Hillary adopted for the general in 2016).

First of all, not in any single post that I made within this thread I ever said or even implied that what the CBP is doing in denying entry is 'bad'. **None!** In fact I mentioned right away that this isn't anything new, that it has been happening for a long time, which implies the opposite, that I completely understand that they're just doing their job, and it is simply what it is and not something special.

You also neglected to recognize that I mentioned twice in this thread how special circumstances **can** be a good reason for students to go home. If they have a really good reason (wedding of a sibling, some family event, etc.), then of course it's okay, and also for sure if there's an emergency like a dying family members. In these cases, absolutely, you do what you have to do. But for vacationing to Europe for fun or simply feeling homesick, I will (and have) advise them that traveling internationally may not be worth it.

And yes, all the stories I mentioned are anecdotal, but they are also my own personal experiences and experiences of dozens of international students from around the world that I have known personally, for the past 20+ years, a very lengthy period of time which I spent either in or around academia. It bothers me when students can't complete their degree, for any reason. And for it to happen simply because they couldn't enter the country after an unnecessary international vacation, is a really dumb reason. So, of course I'm going to advise young international students the best way to navigate living in the US and the best way for them to spend their break time, without jeopardizing their chance of a degree. I emphasized to them that the fact that they are a student here a privilege, and I don't want them to squander it. I took it as my responsibility to inform them of things I am very familiar with, and this includes discouraging them to travel internationally, unless they really need to.

In Western culture, William Shakespeare ascribed emblematic meanings to flowers, especially in Hamlet, Prince of Denmark.

I do understand this. His ""'American Libertarian'-Socialism"" (my words) requires both a centralized state and private property. That makes him a Libertarian, I agree. Still, Milton Friedman did not invent, or even really advocate for a UBI, he advocated a Negative Income Tax, which is similar, maybe even only different to a pedantic point. Other, more truly revolutionary thinkers, like Paine, advocated for things more akin to a Basic Income, with reasoning that sounds as if it's from a more traditional socialists; from Agrarian Justice, ‚ÄúEquality of natural property is the subject of this little essay. Every individual in the world is born therein with legitimate claims on a certain kind of property, or its equivalent.‚Äù

Which is I guess where the crux is, that subsistence payments are not the equivalent to property rights.

Still, I would argue that a more substantial UBI could adequately fill this void, and complete a sort of ""Painian Socialism""  or ""American Libertarian Socialism"" and I think that getting that UBI in place, declaring ownership over the market economy and beginning the *erosion of capitalism*, would be an excellent advancement of the post-capitalist cause. And, like in that [RICH economy](https://abolishwork.com/2014/01/21/the-rich-economy-by-robert-anton-wilson/) piece, the goal is obviously to *increase the dividend*.

&gt;a UBI isnt less 'tankie statist' than a FJG, socialized medicine, or public housing.

I understand your point here, since it does require a strong state, taxation and the inherent threat of violence, but I think you are dismissive of the relative size difference, which creates the appeal. American Libertarians are not in favor of a FJG or public housing, but are for a UBI. Why? That is a meaningful difference, at least in the current political spectrum.

I like Chomsky's [Pragmatic Utopianism](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/12/lessons-from-chomsky) which dovetails nicely into Wright's Envisioning Real Utopias. I think the opportunity to take a step forward is here, but everyone is looking away because Yang doesn't fit nicely into the box we want for him. He is obviously trying very hard to not be called a socialist, even though he is somehow convincing lots of people that we ""collectively own the market, and are owed a share of its prosperity?""

&gt;you can exclude food and healthcare and still a $1000 ubi barely pays for a months rent, if at all.

C'mon. Depends where you live. There are thousands of 3 bedroom homes you can rent for $1000/month all across middle america, not to mention smaller apartments for much less.  I would love the UBI to be higher too, but even getting it across the finish line at a poverty level would still be a huge win.

&gt;i'm skeptical of what all can be accomplished with this other than folks having a million roommates, a point system for sharing chores, and the maintenance of a small garden that doesn't come close to sustaining everyone.

I'm sure when the first capitalists were starting tiny merchant trading enterprises, they didn't imagine that they'd topple the feudal kings of Europe, they just were trying to support themselves without having to provide exploitative labor to their feudal lords. But better economic models continue to grow and here we are. Worker collectives could have an easier time getting started with a UBI, and could begin to out-compete capitalist companies on the employment market, since if people had more choice, they would choose to own their own labor. Of course it starts small, but once people aren't forced to labor for capitialist jobs, they will be making real, if small, progress towards post-capitalism.

I don't really know much or care about crypto either, but I thought maybe some anarcho-types were for it. Not make or break for me.

Would Yang adopting some sort of wealth tax a la Warren as a partial funding mechanism for his Freedom Dividend make it more palatable? And/or funding it by a more progressive income tax? i believe that the funding structure is important, but not as important as the having the equitable payout, and the funding could be adjusted as we try to raise the dividend.

Honestly my biggest thing is the breakdown of wage labor towards a system of universal rights. That seems huge to me. Crucial to my understanding of libertarian socialism and post-capitialism. And also wondering why the market itself can't be considered the ""means of production"" to be collectively owned?

Also taken from that Chomsky current affairs article:

&gt;The libertarian socialists have always been critical of the more ‚ÄúLeninist‚Äù mindset, which sees social change coming from a ‚Äúvanguard‚Äù of intellectuals who know what‚Äôs best for the people. For the anarchistic socialist, the power to change their lives should be in people‚Äôs *own* hands. Thus writing, even on complicated subjects, should be in as clear language as possible, because it shouldn‚Äôt just be available to academics and people who have had elite educations.

Yang seems to be offering a clear path towards a more equitable and free society, but because he doesn't come from the traditional vanguard, he is scoffed at, his ideas not considered, when to me, (not an academic, just a carpenter who likes to read) they seem to fit into a pattern of ideas that grow out of the Libertarian Socialism landscape, but are adapted for implementation into current American politics in a way that Bakunin or Bookchin just can't be. Where as Bernie, because he has some weak socialist label gets a pass even though his policies reinforce the system of wage labor? and create an even more centralized and powerful state than Yang does? All because Bernie decided to call himself a socialist while making his millions? (I'm sorry, I do actually like Bernie and what he has done for socialism, writ large, but his socialism isn't exactly my cup of tea, as I imagine is true for many in this sub, still, I'd definitely be supporting him if Yang hadn't captured my imagination with his unorthodox political alignment.)

Maybe you're right, and Yang is just a Libertarian, but the Libertarians don't like him either. They call him a socialist and I think they might be right, and I guess that means I'm still just a confused rando on the internet.

I still think this is something new, maybe Neo-Painism?, or ""American Libertarian""-Socialism.

Thanks for taking the time to engage.

 A alcunha adv√©m do fato de que Maia [tem se consolidado como protagonista no cen√°rio pol√≠tico](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/07/maia-e-ovacionado-critica-governo-bolsonaro-e-diz-que-centrao-aprovou-reforma.shtml) ao longo deste ano de governo Jair Bolsonaro (PSL).

 Depois de se firmar como principal articulador pol√≠tico da reforma da Previd√™ncia, [agora em tramita√ß√£o no Senado,](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/08/maia-entrega-previdencia-a-alcolumbre-e-proposta-comeca-a-tramitar-no-senado.shtml) o deputado busca manter a C√¢mara no centro do debate pol√≠tico.

 Conhecido como defensor da agenda econ√¥mica de reformas, que incluem a tribut√°ria e a administrativa, Maia tomou a frente em uma √°rea diferente na √∫ltima semana.

 Em meio √† crise das queimadas,[ pediu em nome da C√¢mara ao ministro do STF (Supremo Tribunal Federal) Alexandre de Moraes ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2019/08/maia-quer-que-dinheiro-de-fundo-da-petrobras-seja-destinado-para-amazonia.shtml)a libera√ß√£o de recursos do fundo da Opera√ß√£o Lava Jato para a√ß√µes na Amaz√¥nia.

 [Criticou a posi√ß√£o de Bolsonaro de rejeitar a ajuda financeira do G7](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2019/08/em-meio-a-crise-bolsonaro-prioriza-ataques-a-reservas-indigenas-em-reuniao-com-governadores-da-amazonia.shtml) (""o Brasil n√£o pode abrir m√£o de nenhum real"") e ao mesmo tempo as declara√ß√µes do presidente franc√™s, Emmanuel Macron, sobre o acordo entre Mercosul e Uni√£o Europeia (""o presidente da Fran√ßa ficou isolado"").

 Al√©m disso, [recebeu um grupo de ex-ministros do Meio Ambiente](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2019/08/ex-ministros-pedem-a-maia-suspensao-de-projetos-prejudiciais-ao-ambiente.shtml) que pleitearam que a Casa se esforce para barrar textos antiambientais.

 Em outros fronts, por exemplo, tem articulado projeto para abrir o futebol brasileiro a investidores estrangeiros, sinalizou que a C√¢mara pode avan√ßar nos [pacotes de seguran√ßa p√∫blica](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/08/apos-derrotas-em-serie-pacote-de-seguranca-vira-teste-de-fogo-para-moro.shtml) elaborados por Alexandre de Moraes e pelo ministro da Justi√ßa, Sergio Moro, e instalou comiss√£o para tratar da abertura do mercado de saneamento para empresas privadas.

 ""Ele assumiu esse espa√ßo porque ele [o espa√ßo] foi deixado pelo governo"", afirmou o deputado Alexandre Frota,[ expulso do PSL ap√≥s cr√≠ticas a ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/08/bolsonaro-nao-e-burro-mas-um-idiota-ingrato-que-nada-sabe-diz-alexandre-frota.shtml)[Bolsonaro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/08/bolsonaro-nao-e-burro-mas-um-idiota-ingrato-que-nada-sabe-diz-alexandre-frota.shtml) e que aderiu ao PSDB do governador paulista, Jo√£o Doria. ""O governo n√£o enviou ningu√©m para conversar, para articular, para criar estrat√©gias, quando encaminhou a Previd√™ncia.""

 Maia disse √† **Folha** na sexta-feira (30) que o modelo de governo de Bolsonaro permite que o Legislativo aja com maior independ√™ncia para tocar agendas pr√≥prias. ""O fim do governo de coaliz√£o, que foi decis√£o do presidente, gerou dois Poderes claros. No governo de coaliz√£o, o Parlamento ficava como subproduto do Executivo"", afirmou.

 Segundo o cientista pol√≠tico e professor da PUC Minas Malco Camargos, a impress√£o de for√ßa incomum do Congresso de 2019 vem, na verdade, do fato de que legislaturas anteriores costumavam ficar a reboque de articula√ß√µes do presidente.

 ""Fala-se que estamos caminhando para um semipresidencialismo, mas na verdade o que est√° acontecendo √© que o Legislativo est√° deixando de ser subserviente e ocupando a sua fun√ß√£o"", diz.

 Se Maia acumulou aliados e poder dentro da Casa (teve, na elei√ß√£o para a presid√™ncia da C√¢mara deste ano, sua maior quantidade de votos dos tr√™s pleitos que disputou), a postura de protagonista n√£o agrada a todos os parlamentares.

 Ele recebe cr√≠ticas principalmente daqueles ligados √†s bases bolsonaristas nas redes sociais. Na quarta-feira (28), depois da reuni√£o com os ex-ministros, a deputada Carla Zambelli (PSL-SP) foi ao Twitter verbalizar insatisfa√ß√£o.

 ""Maia quer sinalizar que o Parlamento 'seja um instrumento de equil√≠brio neste processo de desenvolvimento, sem deixar de lado o Meio Ambiente'. Como falei no meu discurso de domingo na [avenida] Paulista: o Executivo √© com Jair Bolsonaro. E parece que o parlamentarismo √© apoiado aqui'"", escreveu.

 Parte das cr√≠ticas pode ser explicada por um antagonismo que se criou entre o mandat√°rio da C√¢mara e o do Planalto no primeiro semestre e que virou a base do presidente contra Maia.

 A troca de farpas chegou ao ponto de Bolsonaro dizer que [Maia era como uma namorada que quer ir embora](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/03/bolsonaro-compara-maia-a-namora-que-quer-ir-embora.shtml). Sobrou tamb√©m para Sergio Moro, que teve seu projeto anticrime [chamado pelo deputado de ""copia e cola""](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/03/maia-diz-que-projeto-de-moro-e-copia-e-cola-e-que-ministro-confunde-as-bolas.shtml) do texto do ministro do Supremo Alexandre de Moraes.

 O pr√≥prio Frota chegou a ser escalado, quando ainda estava no PSL, para ajudar no restabelecimento de rela√ß√µes entre membros do governo e o presidente da C√¢mara na √©poca da Previd√™ncia.

 No segundo semestre, o clima segue mais ameno. Embora tenha procurado se distanciar das falas de Bolsonaro nas quest√µes ambientais, Maia foi cuidadoso ao expor as cr√≠ticas. Disse em diversas vezes que, embora as palavras ""radicais"" do presidente possam passar uma ideia equivocada, o governo n√£o adotou a√ß√µes que facilitassem queimadas.

 Para o presidente da C√¢mara, o relacionamento mudou de ambos os lados. ""Eu acho que, do ponto de vista da rela√ß√£o do governo com a pol√≠tica, teve uma mudan√ßa. Acho que teve tamb√©m uma compreens√£o [dos deputados] do estilo do presidente e que n√£o dever√≠amos cumprir o papel de necessariamente polemizar em todos os conflitos"", disse. ""J√° que muitas vezes isso n√£o leva a nada, era melhor deixar o presidente falar.""

 O professor da PUC Minas avalia que a mudan√ßa de atitude do governo veio por causa do sucesso que a reforma da Previd√™ncia obteve na C√¢mara.

 ""Como h√° a aus√™ncia do poder articulador do presidente, o pr√≥prio Executivo percebeu que o Maia tem prestado esse servi√ßo no Congresso, e passou a enxerg√°-lo n√£o como advers√°rio, mas como aliado"", disse.

 ""O curioso √© que √© um aliado que vai ganhando protagonismo, e n√£o subservi√™ncia.""

 Na segunda-feira (26), [uma not√≠cia negativa relacionada a Maia ajudou a derrubar a Bolsa](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/08/dolar-bolsa-risco-pais-e-juros-voltam-a-patamar-anterior-a-aprovacao-da-previdencia.shtml) e a elevar o d√≥lar. A Pol√≠cia Federal havia atribu√≠do a ele os crimes de corrup√ß√£o passiva, falsidade ideol√≥gica eleitoral (caixa dois) e lavagem de dinheiro ao concluir inqu√©rito sobre supostos repasses da Odebrecht ao deputado.

 As redes sociais pegaram fogo. ""Rodrigo Maia √© o primeiro-ministro imagin√°rio do pa√≠s imagin√°rio do centr√£o"", escreveu um usu√°rio. ""Rodrigo 'Botafogo' Maia, tua casa vai cair!"", postou outro, em refer√™ncia ao apelido atribu√≠do ao pol√≠tico na lista de supostos repasses da Odebrecht.

 Na ter√ßa (27), por√©m, o clima no Congresso era de normalidade. Maia negou as acusa√ß√µes ao chegar √† Casa, e o dia transcorreu sem que o assunto fosse o centro do debate.

 Para o cientista pol√≠tico, a menos que existam fatos novos, as acusa√ß√µes contra Maia n√£o s√£o suficientes para abalar o apoio que ele possui entre seus pares.

 ""Acho que ele e o pr√≥prio Bolsonaro j√° entenderam que essas cr√≠ticas n√£o abalam o funcionamento da pol√≠tica hoje em dia. Independentemente do volume de cr√≠ticas que voc√™ recebe, se voc√™ tem um conjunto de atores que encampam o seu discurso, isso faz valer a sua vontade"", afirma Camargos.

Because they are all money launders or use money laundering on a global scale.

I have thousands of hours in eso (hence the username here) and i like(d) the game, but it has so many performance-issues, it's unbelievable. PC EU has seen some crazy stuff over the last months, everything from random disconnects for whole raidgroups in PVE which reset the instance, mobs bugged so hard that it causes wipes, dungeon tool not working (even with a premade group from zonechat you just can't port into a dungeon...), PvP at primetime is just unplayable unless you enjoy a slideshow of 2 fps.. And the latest patch is a kick in the face to endgame-players, dumbing down class identity and making raid-combat mindnumbingly dull. Last point was the last straw for me, and i am what you'd call a hardcore-pve-raider over there. I cannot recommend ESO to anyone at the moment, first they need to get their shit together and fix their servers.

Combat-wise, eso is a lot faster than WoW classic, in classic it is very difficult for me getting used to all those long casttimes and cooldowns.  
Still, I really really love WoW classic so far, i haven't had this much fun in a game for a VERY long time! It is just SO MUCH FUN. Currently level 22, doing quests with my partner (who also came from ESO) and we even have done our first dungeon. Both of us had never played WoW before but are totally hooked already, this weekend was madness. Hectic food-preparations for the whole day during the morning queue and whatnot.

Almost certainly, the answer is that those who spend their lives studying ancient Egypt have no reason to know much about medieval Muslim history. But this means they do not realize that the Arab chronicles they cite are collections of legends and traditions needing interpretation. Indeed, the earliest, written by the generally reliable al-Mas‚Äôudi and dating to no earlier than c. 950, does not even mention Ma‚Äômun as the caliph who visited Giza. Al-Mas‚Äôudi attributes the breaching of the pyramid to Ma‚Äômun‚Äôs father, Haroun al-Rashid, a ruler best remembered as the caliph of the Thousand and One Nights‚Äîand he appears in a distinctly fabulous context. When, the chronicler writes, after weeks of labor Haroun‚Äôs men finally forced their way in, they:

&gt;found a vessel filled with a thousand coins of the finest gold, each of which was a dinar in weight. When Haroun al-Rashid saw the gold, he ordered that the expenses he incurred should be calculated, and the amount was found exactly equal to the treasure which was discovered.

It should be stated here that least one apparently straightforward account of Ma‚Äômun‚Äôs doings does survive; Al-Idrisi, writing in 1150, says that the caliph‚Äôs men uncovered both ascending and descending passages, plus a vault containing a sarcophagus which, when opened, proved to contain ancient human remains. But other chroniclers of the same period tell different and more fantastical tales. One, Abu Hamid, the Andalusian author of the Tuhfat al Albab, insists that he himself entered the Great Pyramid, yet goes on to talk of several large ‚Äúapartments‚Äù containing bodies ‚Äúenveloped in many wrappers, that had become black through length of time,‚Äù and then insists that

&gt;those who went up there in the time of Ma‚Äômun came to a small passage, containing the image of a man in green stone, which was taken out for examination before the Caliph; when it was opened a human body was discovered in golden armor, decorated with precious stones, and in his hand was a sword of inestimable value, and above his head a ruby the size of an egg, which shone like fire.

What, though, of the earliest accounts of the tunnel dug into the pyramid? Here the most influential writers are two other Muslim chroniclers, Abd al-Latif (c.1220) and the renowned world traveler Ibn Battuta (c.1360). Both men report that Ma‚Äômun ordered his men to break into Khufu‚Äôs monument using fire and sharpened iron stakes‚Äîfirst the stones of the pyramid were heated, then cooled with vinegar, and, as cracks appeared in them, hacked to pieces using sharpened iron staves. Ibn Battuta adds that a battering ram was used to smash open a passage.

Nothing in either of these accounts seems implausible, and the Great Pyramid does indeed bear the scar of a narrow passage that has been hacked into its limestone and which is generally supposed to have been excavated by Ma‚Äômun. The forced passage is located fairly logically, too, right in the middle of the north face, a little below and a little to the right of the real (but then concealed) entrance, which the cunning Egyptians of Khufu‚Äôs day had placed 24 feet off center in an attempt to out-think would-be tomb robbers. Yet the fact remains that the Arab versions were written 400 to 500 years after Ma‚Äômun‚Äôs time; to expect them to be accurate summaries of what took place in the ninth century is the equivalent of asking today‚Äôs casual visitor to Virginia to come up with a credible account of the lost colony of Roanoke. And on top of that, neither Abd al-Latif nor Ibn Battuta says anything about how Ma‚Äômun decided where to dig, or mentions the story of the falling capstone guiding the exhausted tunnelers.

Given all this, it is legitimate to ask why anyone believes it was Ma‚Äômun who entered the Great Pyramid, and to wonder how the capstone story entered circulation. The answer sometimes advanced to the first question is that there is a solitary account that dates, supposedly, to the 820s and so corroborates Arab tradition. This is an old Syriac fragment (first mentioned in this context in 1802 by a French writer named Silvestre de Sacy) which relates that the Christian patriarch Dionysius Telmahrensis accompanied Ma‚Äômun to the pyramids and described the excavation that the caliph made there. Yet this version of events, too, turns out to date to hundreds of years later. It appears not in the chronicle that De Sacy thought was written by Dionysius (and which we now know was completed years before Ma‚Äômun‚Äôs time, in 775-6 A.D., and composed by someone else entirely), but in the 13th century Chronicon Ecclesiasticum of Bar-Hebraeus. This author, another Syrian bishop, incorporates passages of his predecessor‚Äôs writings, but there is no way of establishing whether they are genuine. To make matters worse, the scrap relating to the pyramids says only that Dionysius looked into ‚Äúan opening‚Äù in one of the three monuments of Giza‚Äîwhich might or might not have been a passage in the Great Pyramid, and might or might not have excavated by Ma‚Äômun. This realization takes us no closer to knowing whether the caliph really was responsible for opening the pyramid, and leaves us as dependent on late date Arab sources as we were before.

As for the story of the falling capstone‚Äìthat remains an enigma. A concerted hunt reveals that it first made print in the middle of the 19th century, published by Charles Piazzi Smyth. But Smyth does not say where he found it. There are hints, which I still hope to run to ground some day, that it may have made its first appearance in the voluminous works of a Muslim scientist, Abu Salt al-Andalusi. Abu Salt likewise traveled in Egypt. Very intriguingly, he picked up much of his information while held under house arrest in an ancient library in Alexandria.

The problem, though, is this: even if Smyth got his story from Abu Salt, and even if Abu Salt was scrupulous, the Muslim chronicler was writing not in the 820s but in the 12th century. (He was imprisoned in Egypt in 1107-11.) So while there may still be an outside chance that the account of the falling capstone is based on some older, now lost source, we certainly can‚Äôt say that for certain. It may be equally likely that the story is a pure invention.

You see, the forced entry that has been driven into the pyramid is just a little too good to be true. Put it this way: perhaps the question that we should be asking is how a passage dug apparently at random in a structure the size of the Great Pyramid emerges at the exact spot where the Descending and the Ascending Passages meet, and where the secrets of the upper reaches of the pyramid are at their most exposed.

Coincidence? I just don‚Äôt think so. More likely someone, somewhere, sometime knew precisely where to dig. Which would mean the chances are that ‚ÄúMa‚Äômun‚Äôs passage‚Äù was hacked out centuries before the Muslims came to Egypt, if only to be choked with rubble and forgotten‚Äîperhaps even in dynastic times. And that, in turn, means something else: that Khufu‚Äôs greatest mystery was never quite as secret as he‚Äôd hoped.

We know what factors influenced this - some of them you think are more important than others?**

Believing in the durability of alliances is one thing, but probably more important to me is the combination of two factors: the ignorance of the disproportion of forces and the influence of pre-war propaganda, lined with a certain superpower ambition.

I can partially understand this optimism. Let's look at it this way: Poland won its independence, in spite of many obstacles, set its own borders, first of all: it defeated the Bolsheviks, being in much weaker positions than in 1939. At the end of the 1930s, Poland has the fifth largest army in the world and it is certainly not as primitive as the German propaganda will later present it.

**Let's go back to the power imbalance.**

The difference in numbers does not reflect the German advantage. The Polish army faced the most technologically advanced army in the world at that time. It had no chance in such a clash.

**The defense war was lost even before it started?**

My answer is this: the most important mistakes or omissions were made long before September. We must be aware that the difference in economic potential was the deciding factor - the expenditure of the Second Polish Republic on armaments was a fraction of what the Third Reich could afford.

However, it is also about differences in consciousness. There was insufficient awareness in Poland of how the armoured forces and the general mechanization of the army would change the war. France, Great Britain and Germany realized this at the end of World War I on the western front. In the interwar period in each of these countries the development of armoured weapons had its own influential spokesman.

**And in Poland?**

The Poles did not learn such a lesson, and from the lesson they could learn - the war with the Bolsheviks - they came to the wrong conclusion. The cavalry, which triumphed then, gained a very prestigious position not only in the army, but also in society in general. This was one of the factors blocking the mechanization of the Polish army, regardless of the financial possibilities of the state.

This does not mean, in any case, that in September the Polish army did everything in its power to exploit its potential. Probably the most important obstacle was the problems with communication. They were intensified by the pace of the German attack, but they came mainly from the culture of military secrecy: even armies or units close to each other could not communicate without the mediation of the Supreme Command.

German commanders were expected to take initiatives, be flexible and react to the changing situation on their own - Polish commanders had their hands tied.

**In this book, you're dispeling a few myths that are still coming back to us today. Let's take the blitzkrieg.**

In 1939, the blitzkrieg doctrine was neither refined nor applied as widely as it is often believed. It happened, for example, that armoured units found themselves 25-30 km behind Polish lines, isolated from the rest of the units. This of course does not change the fact that the German army surpassed Poles with mobility.

I am cautious about the blitzkrieg story as early as September, also because the greatest amount of information about it could be learned from Nazi propaganda at that time. By the way, in the West it was too often taken for a good coin. Meanwhile, the story of the blitzkrieg was then used, among other things, to instil conviction that the well-armed and motorized German army had crushed the army of the last century, which was coupled with the the thesis of the racial superiority of the Germans. The legend about the charge of the Polish cavalry against tanks was also included in it.

**What did the parties involved learn from the September campaign?**

The Reich was definitely driven by it - it was a huge impulse for the Wehrmacht, the Germans strengthened their sense of racial, military and civilisational superiority. The army realized that the blitzkrieg was the right direction to take - and indeed this doctrine was supposed to determine the German successes in 1940-41.

The Western Allies didn't understand much. It was convenient for them to assume that the Polish defeat was decided only by Polish weaknesses, and at the same time they were convinced - again: imperial superiority - that they would do better with Hitler. The reality quickly verified this - with France, which in autumn 1939 had the second largest army in the world and a tank much better than German models, it took 6 weeks for Germans to conquer them. That is, approximately as much as the September campaign lasted.

Stalin did not so much draw conclusions, as he managed to put the chess pieces on the chessboard again. In the short term, the USSR received a very favourable trade agreement with the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the consequences of which we know very well. Most importantly, however, Hitler allowed Stalin to present himself as a destructor of the European status quo. It was a desirable situation for the USSR: to make the imperialists fight each other, and to take on a neutral role, even if only apparently. The Bolsheviks came to power as a result of the upheavals caused by one war and Stalin hoped that another shock - military, social and economic - would allow the Soviets to dominate the whole of Europe.

**The struggle of the Polish September 1939 is a campaign in which the previous war meets the modern. Do you agree?**

Totally. The fighting sides use cavalry - incidentally, Germans have more of it than Poles - and armoured trains, i.e. means commonly used in the Polish-Soviet War. At the same time, what is happening in September'39 in Poland, announces under what conditions this war will take place: armoured weapon attacks, air war, intentional murdering of civilians...

I knew about the war crimes committed by the Germans in Poland, but I must admit that, after exploring the subject, I was surprised: by the scale, brutality, how easy it was to push people to kill, providing them with ideological motivation. Not even for a moment should we forget that when the Germans were fighting a racial war on the occupied territories, the Soviets in the east were fighting no less brutal class war.

It is very important for me that the knowledge about German crimes during the invasion of Poland should be included in the mainstream of Western memory of the war. I often deal with the conviction that the Germans brutalized themselves during the war gradually - this is half true, and it is due to the fact that relatively easily accessible German sources and publications were trusted too often. Since e.g. the French campaign in comparison to others in this war was considered to be carried out almost chivalrously, this means that ""earlier probably also could not be so scary"".

No, not at all. The brutal racial war began with the attack on Poland. The announcement of a mass crime was in this from the very beginning.",True,False,False,,,0,1567329853,,False,0,{},eyq7slf,True,t3_cy7w76,False,True,t1_eyq7s2s,/r/europe/comments/cy7w76/roger_moorhouse_the_allies_did_not_leave_poland/eyq7slf/,False,,1575917155,1,True,[],False,europe,t5_2qh4j,r/europe,public,0,

I have never said anything about Syria and let me tell you something, 90% of people in Turkey are aggressively against what the government is doing in Syria and the fact that I do know pkk is a terrorist organization doesn‚Äôt mean I approve everything the Turkish government have done about this issue.

We're talking about terrorist activity here? You linked to PKK supposedly setting fires in Izmir. I think there are more pressing issues and crimes being committed that I raised and something you should be concerned about, but based on your comment you're aware of it I guess and don't support which it. Fine.

Terror is terror. Turkey has a hand in it as we speak as of today, that's my point, while the PKK is not. Say it how it is. There was a past in which the PKK was committing crimes and there is evidence of this, however during that time Turkey was activity committing state crimes, today it is still doing such actives, which amounts to terror either way. If you are against it, I have nothing negative to say, I am not here to argue with someone being against it terrorist activity.

&gt;Secondly, your best argument about tons of countries recognizing the terrorism are doing it just because they are business and military partners with Turkey. EU is the biggest business partner yet they during Turkey-Armenia dispute they sided with Armenia. They also supported Cyprus during the Cypriot dispute even though Cyprus was not a part of either EU nor Nato at the time.

My best argument is a strong argument. What you're talking isn't accurate. Turkey-Armenia dispute has meant that a lot of countries, like the United States doesn't admit that Turkey committed genocide. Same as in Europe. It is only when they get pissed off and want to piss off Turkey do they start to admit it. Look at France for example, very recently admitted the genocide, after all the years of same evidence. They definitely do not side with Armenia. This is easy politics to understand.

With regards to Cyprus, that's not necessarily true. Cyprus and Greece are EU members and you can see the pattern of agreement reflecting that.. Even the US sided with Cyprus, because it's annexing land, which they do not want Turkey to do. It's massive differences.

&gt;And you actually think Kazakhstan is doing that because of Nato, like, wtf? Kazakhstan is not a global partner of nato [https://www.nato.int/cps/ra/natohq/topics\_49188.htm](https://www.nato.int/cps/ra/natohq/topics_49188.htm) and did you actually researched Kazakhstan?

[https://astanatimes.com/2015/02/steppe-eagle-2015-multinational-peacekeeping-exercises-held-april-june/](https://astanatimes.com/2015/02/steppe-eagle-2015-multinational-peacekeeping-exercises-held-april-june/) Kazakhstan is a bitch country and is playing as much politics as it can, but funny how you focused on that.. That turned out bad for you, didn't it? Be honest.

&gt;And you just said I am extremely biased, bigoted nationalistic and arrogant while one of your threads is literally ‚ÄúWhy I despise Turkey‚Äù. Can you please link 1 posts or comment that I said anything bad about the kurdish people?

Called their biggest resistance group terrorists. What other group is there that represents them in Turkey? They're all attacked. Everyone is PKK so calling them terrorists is an attack on Kurds.

&gt;And if you think I am voting my own posts with 30+ accounts, do the experiment I just mentioned. Just create another account so I won‚Äôt be able to see tour comment, write ‚Äúpkk is not terrorists‚Äù on literally any mainstream subreddit, [r/europe](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/), [r/politics](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/) or even [r/funny](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/). When you glorify terrorism, people downvote it, it‚Äôs that simple.

I always say it? Wtf are you on about? Why would I need another account to state this? I don't get downvoted, only when there is an influx of turkish accounts or I come across a turk who spreads it within their nationalistic channels do I suddenly get a spam of downvotes. It's too obvious, we're not dumb.

&gt;And it‚Äôs so funny that you are the one accusing me of this because you literally quite obviously upvoted your comment with an alt account. Oh forget about the experiment you will probably create 50 account just because of butthurtness.

Because

You have a post

The crux of all this for me though is that I think parliament are very good at ruling things out but not so good at deciding what they might actually accept Brexit-wise - as the indicative votes show. We cannot just extend, delay, and faff about with Brexit forever. At some point it will come to a conclusion. If parliament (or the May-Labour talks) had of agreed a position then the government would have had a mandate to try and deliver it. As it is, there is no guidance from parliament about what deal it might accept, so no chance of a deal being passed; as in my opinion the opposition benches will vote down any deal the government brings (I believe Sturgeon has said as much).   
So in lieu of a deal, and with the vote still not being implemented, it is not surprising we have ended up heading towards no deal due to the conditions of article 50 (which parliament overwhelmingly voted for).  
Really I would prefer the opposition had an actual plan to get us out of the current mess rather than just 'stopping no deal'. 

Also lets not rule out the EU saying no at some point, or imposing some sort of condition the UK might not like on an extension.

There‚Äôs plenty of evidence to suggest it‚Äôs culturally conditioned. You can ask a musicologist or r/musictheory thread why 4/4 is supposedly ‚Äònatural‚Äô and you‚Äôll be met with a myriad of examples that go against the assumed premise of the question. You‚Äôre likely referring to the time sigs of those other cultures as ‚Äústrange‚Äù because you‚Äôre speaking from a western perspective. To those cultures, those times are very natural, and it‚Äôs not just for ‚Äútrance-like‚Äù purposes. There‚Äôs many non-western musical cultures and non-western folk music other than those in asymmetrical meters. It wasn‚Äôt even always the case for western music itself temporally speaking. Before the 20th century, European dance music was in 3/4, such as waltzes. In fact, 3/4 would be considered the ‚Äòideal‚Äô meter in most circa Renaissance era music as it coincided with the Holy Trinity. Gregorian chant, a musical tradition of the western world, had meters that would be unrecognizable to a modern ear raised on 4/4 (in some cases, there was no meters at all).  Actually most music before the 20th century wasn‚Äôt based solely in 4/4. With the aforementioned examples, and others like Greece, Balkan music, Bulgarian music, Latin music, etc. 

It‚Äôs a more modern trend, largely informed by the influence of Blues, Rock ‚Äòn‚Äô Roll, and R&amp;B, which owes its roots to Jazz, and 40-50-60 years where it dominates pop music (in one region of the world) pales in comparison to 1000s where it wasn‚Äôt even always the case. There‚Äôs a video by a YouTuber named Adam Neely named ‚ÄúScotch Snaps‚Äù that makes strong arguments that the way you speak language heavily influences the music you make, listen to, and/or by extension how your general culture inherits it (also see 12Tone‚Äôs ‚ÄúIs Music really a Universal Language‚Äù for similar topics). To say something is ‚Äúuniversal‚Äù is to say it is true everywhere, absolutely for all time, and this is historically not the case. So it begs the question, how is 4/4 universal if there are other cultures that reach different conclusions regarding ‚Äòfeel‚Äô without the influence of modern western sensibilities? 7/8 would feel just as ‚Äònatural‚Äô if we based our cultures‚Äô music around it.


‚ÄúThe giants were on another level, and could think of anything and write it down.‚Äù I know that your knowledge of classical music is limited, but I say this as someone that was raised on rock music and had a mentality similar to yours, until  later in life when I went to learn about it more and researched the history of music. Hearing music in your head and learning to write it down from scratch, is actually a pretty common practice and exercise within classically minded musicians. Plus, we didn‚Äôt know them. We don‚Äôt know the hardships or hurdles they had to overcome in order to develop themselves to the level they got to. There are outliers, sure, but ‚Äònatural talent‚Äô only gets you so far. Debussy didn‚Äôt compose ‚ÄúLa Mer‚Äù when he was 4 years old. He did it when he had a long life of experience and training. Learning to better write the music you want to and be the best musician you can be is more worthwhile than trying to be the next Mozart. From a personal point of view, I just reject the ‚Äòmystery‚Äô argument in general, as not only is it a nebulous assertion that borders on meaningless to be helpful (like, it‚Äôs just as meaningful as asking ‚Äòwell why does anything work?‚Äô), but it can easily be used as an excuse to not grow, or improve because you don‚Äôt ‚Äògot it.‚Äô It appeals to an absolute standard, and assumes music exists in a vacuum, which it simply just doesn‚Äôt.",True,False,False,,,0,1567337953,,False,0,{},eyqcy4q,False,t3_cxc3sz,False,True,t1_eyo9zhx,/r/Music/comments/cxc3sz/tools_latest_album_fear_inoculum_now_available_on/eyqcy4q/,False,,1575919600,2,True,[],False,Music,t5_2qh1u,r/Music,public,0,

Operation Yellowhammer: leaked files reveal medicines that will run out first

An inability to stockpile drugs for many serious illnesses mean shortages will hit patients hard, according to doctors

Senior doctors have warned the NHS to brace itself for the ‚Äúbiggest threat it has ever faced‚Äù if the UK crashes out of the EU on October 31, as a leaked internal document reveals the risks to patients from expected drug shortages.

Confidential files from NHS England, seen by The Sunday Times, list medicines that have been impossible to stockpile, including for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, epilepsy and the chronic pain condition trigeminal neuralgia.

The documents, which show the drugs categorised according to the expected impact of shortages, also set out suggested measures for combating supply problems including flying the drugs in.

Last month the leak of the government‚Äôs Operation Yellowhammer document
laid bare the gaps in its planning for a no-deal Brexit. The Yellowhammer file, which was dated early August, stated that supply chains for medicines were ‚Äúparticularly vulnerable‚Äù to border delays. About three-quarters of medicines enter the UK via the main Channel crossings.

A senior Whitehall source, who is familiar with an earlier version of the Yellowhammer document
, said the government‚Äôs fears around the supply of drugs had grown since March 31, the original date for departing from the EU.

‚ÄúI was quite startled that this appears still to be a serious concern,‚Äù the source said. ‚ÄúBack in March ministers were reasonably satisfied that medicines were going to be OK. It‚Äôs now looking like that confidence has diminished.‚Äù

In June the government outlined plans to secure freight capacity to bring medicines from the Continent in the event of no-deal. The Sunday Times understands that the army could bring in drugs under one worst-case scenario plan. However, senior medics expressed fears that such a move would be insufficient.

Dr Sarah Wollaston, the Liberal Democrat MP and chair of the health select committee, said: ‚ÄúEvery year the NHS has one or two product lines where there are supply chain issues. What‚Äôs different with a no-deal Brexit is it will happen on a much greater scale, for many products at the same time, and at the start of the busiest period for the NHS.‚Äù

The leaked NHS England documents shine a spotlight on how hundreds of treatments are likely to be prioritised in the event of shortages following a no-deal.

In January the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) contacted the royal colleges seeking expert views as part of its planning. About two months later doctors who had volunteered for these unpaid roles were sent files ‚Äî marked ‚Äúofficial sensitive‚Äù ‚Äî and asked to categorise drugs that could not be stockpiled.

A traffic-light system was used. ‚ÄúRed‚Äù meant a shortage would have a ‚Äúsignificant impact on [the] patient and healthcare system‚Äù and affect ‚Äúclinical outcomes‚Äù, which could include survival rates. ‚ÄúAmber‚Äù meant ‚Äúsome impact‚Äù and ‚Äúgreen‚Äù meant no effect on the patient. This system was intended to be used to prioritise drugs to be brought in.

The files, which cover 20 treatments, relate to neurology, mental health and pain relief, and are dated from March. It is understood that the royal colleges have not yet been approached to update these documents before October 31.

Dr David Nicholl, a consultant neurologist in Birmingham, was one of two doctors asked to categorise the treatments in March. He has since become a whistleblower, arguing that this information ‚Äúshould not be kept confidential‚Äù and raising concerns about the impact of a no-deal Brexit on patients.

‚ÄúWithout a clear and transparent mitigation plan that has been fully tested, the NHS faces the biggest threat it has ever faced and patients will come to harm as a result,‚Äù he said.

Professor Andrew Goddard, president of the Royal College of Physicians, said he was ‚Äúvery worried‚Äù about the supply of medicines and items such as implants and prosthetics.

‚ÄúThe NHS is bending over backwards to try to get as ready as it can, but the system is very vulnerable,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf something really bad happened ‚Äî like problems at the EU-UK border ‚Äî it can become a big issue very quickly.‚Äù

He criticised what he called a lack of honesty in the government‚Äôs approach. ‚ÄúWhat frustrates me as a clinician is the rhetoric that ‚Äòno one will go short of medicines or come to any harm‚Äô,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen I discuss a treatment with a patient, I talk about the risks and benefits and warn of the side effects. We‚Äôre not being honest as a country with the public about the potential risks of a no-deal Brexit when it comes to medicines.‚Äù

The government said: ‚ÄúAs part of a responsible government, the department [DHSC] is doing everything appropriate to prepare for Brexit. We want to reassure patients that we should be fully prepared for leaving on October 31, whatever the circumstances.

‚ÄúWe are taking all appropriate steps, meaning our plans should ensure the supply of medicines and medical products remains uninterrupted when we leave the EU.‚Äù

I understand your reasoning about growing, but no reason to give people low strenggt potency weed when everyone knows we could grow high potency strains. Its disappointing, all talks about openess and drying out the black market - when you provide people only 5 or 10% weed, it is simply not competitive to the black market ( and thus it could stay illegal, because what sense is then behind legalization).

Regulation yes, but when i hear Schneider calling it a success  that 40% of smokers buying illegal MONTHS after legalization in Kanada, its a bit of a joke.
Another thing that REALLY enfuriates me is the fixed price of 9‚Ç¨/g, that means we will probably not choose between different strains ( thats really dumb, even the worst coffeeshop has more choices - thats how you mess up legalization ). Im perhaps too pessimistic, were already having lots of cbd strains too choose.

I believe more and more its more about the money and nothing else if they give us one fixed strain of 10% too choose.

The issue is, that eventually we will need to have a trade deal with the EU, and they know it.  This means that all No-Deal does is put us in a much weaker position for the future negotiation because we wilfully inflicted chaos on the global economy.

The only way No-Deal can work as a threat is if it becomes Never-Deal.  If the EU thought that we would leave, and unless there was a deal in place, we would refuse to trade on anything other than WTO terms for at least a generation and we would expel all EU nationals essentially immediately, then they would probably move their positions.  But there is no real talk of that happening.  In other words, for No-Deal to be a legitimate threat to move positions, it has to be a full scorched earth threat. 

The core problem is that the Leavers kept promising unicorns that can't happen, because if they did, it would show other countries that they are actually better off out than in.  This is the main message of the Leave campaign, that we can actually have all the perks of being in the EU, with none of the burdens.  If the EU did ANYTHING that made this seem to be possible, all of the other countries that have flirted with leaving will start to move towards the exits.  Right now, the reason that they aren't is specifically because they see how badly the UK is being screwed by leaving, both by the EU, and by internal divisions.  

I'm also a remainer, but the best way to have gotten a good deal would be first to address the reasons why people wanted to leave, try to negotiate a better relationship inside, and then if that couldn't be achieved, get an internal consensus of that would make the majority of British citizens happy, and take that to Brussels.   As long as Brussels see as disunited country, which they will always be on No-Deal because of how bad it really will be, they aren't going to move.

That's two years of currency flight, of businesses relocating, of it being very difficult for people in Scotland to take out a mortgage or borrow to invest.

Japan could expand because their main rival was China and not another european power until Russia came along. However european powers failed to colonise Korea also, so Japan could claim Korea. And Russia was a different opponent than Britain or France would have been.  

Siam would have to compete with the Dutch East Indies, French Indochina and British Malaysia. So they'd need to expand in these regions before they're claimed by european powers or they would need to go into direct confrontation with them.  

The French involvement in Indochina began early with missionary work and militarily in the early 1800s, but their main effort began in the 1850s, with the protectorate was founded in 1887. 
British involvement also began in the early 1800s, British Malaya was founded in 1826. 
The dutch East Indies began even earlier. [Here is an overview over the dutch expansion](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Dutch_East_Indies_Expansion.gif). In the 1860s they already had controll over large parts of Indonesia. 

So compare that to Japan. 1854 Commodore Perry arrived in Japan. The Boshin War was fought in 1868-69. The first Sino-Japanese War happened in 1894-95, thereafter the annexation of Taiwan. Korea became *independent* in 1897 too and was annexed in 1910. Before that there was a failed american intervention in Korea in 1871.  

So whats the conclusion of this. Japan had more time to industrialise and could expand into a power vacuum. To be successful, Siam has to begin its ambitions in the early 1800s and seek to modernise and also to industrialise. In that it needs definitely european allies to do so, also perhaps to avoid having a european coalition of britich, french and dutch against them.  
As for the French, Siam would need to be more inclusive to christian missionaries. Which might be problematic for the buddhist monarchy. Perhaps the Dutch and British could be better allies.  

If successful, Siam might end up controlling parts of the Malay Peninsuly. Perhaps also several islands on the indonesian archipelago. If they oppose France with the help of the British, they might expand further into Cambodia and Laos, perhaps even Burma and southern China. Spain was declining at that time also, perhaps Siam could colonise the Phillippines also.   

In the long run they might end up as allies to Japan, which would definitely strengthen them since it would give them powerful ally and a stronger base in SEA, with access to Oil in Indonesia. 
Ultimately Japan would therefore have also a stronger starting point in the second World War. 

However ultimately Siam would be under far more pressure earlier than Japan was.

&gt;any thoughts on the North Sea?

I think that dividing the union in such a way is a terrible idea. But I voted to remain, which would completely avoid having to do that. Why do you not hold leavers accountable for not warning you that this would be a possible outcome?

&gt;What about the 'stop brexit' ass wipe lending credence to the idea that 'remaining' is still an option? Does he have a job? I doubt it. He must be supporting himself from donations. Protesting is one thing, but taking money to influence the nations views is surely fraudulent.

This is called lobbying, and rightly or wrongly is a fundamental part of our political system. Again it is your responsibility to be aware of this, I can't help you if you haven't bothered to help yourself. Do you have the same opinion of people like Aaron Banks, an unelected businessman who funnelled millions of pounds into the leave campaign to influence the nation's views?

&gt;What about the Irish issue? A bunch of Irishmen made a special pact to stop bombing each other over a pathetic religious dispute, now it has been taken as an issue front-and-centre to the 'brexit' debate. 

We made a sovereign commitment to never reintroduce border checks on the island of Ireland. If we had chosen to remain, then this would be a non-issue. Again, it is not remainers' fault that we decided to leave, you should take it up with the leave campaign for lying to you and completely ignoring this glaring issue with leaving.

&gt;Again, my breath has been taken away by the hypocrisy here. The dirty tactic of weakening the resolve of the British voter to attempt to ignore their wishes is disgusting.

Did the leave campaign not repeatedly say that making a deal would be easy? Remainers warned about this, but apparently you chose to ignore them, and believed the people that said that they could get a deal. I still don't understand why your issue is not with the people that repeatedly lied about the consequences of leaving. As far as I'm concerned, they got us in this mess, and have the sole responsibility for getting us out of it.

1) Serbia &amp; Montenegro 2004 (Call me biased, but hey, what do I care? As far as I'm concerned, this is our very best entry, and a contender for best ESC song of all-time, full stop. Zeljko is probably our most illustrious songwriter, and with Lane Moje he managed to encapsulate the very best of Serbian folk culture and bring it to the international stage packed into three minutes of absolute perfection. The flute, the violin solo, the epic drums, the brilliantly simple melody, the emotions, and of course Zeljko's powerful performance all add up to make a song that can give you chills even without understanding a single word of it. An absolute marvel of a musical composition which still touches me even to this day.)

2) Ukraine 2007 (If I ever wanted to encapsulate the spirit of Eurovision in a single song, this would be it. The song itself is danceable and incredibly fun, the lyrics are hilariously stupid, the choreography is iconic, the costumes are wonderfully ridiculous, the performance is camp on top of camp, and of course, Verka is just an absolute legend. Danilko is an absolutely hilarious comedian, and with this number he managed to combine his particular brand of humour with one of the catchiest damn entries in Eurovision history, all the while making it his goal to shock anyone and everyone. This is Eurovision drag done right!)

3) Russia 2012 (Continuing the tradition of silliness are these absolute icons. People go on bashing this entry, but really, I think it isn't deserving of the hate. I genuinely like the song, the babushki are really cute, the Udmurt language is a nice touch, and most importantly, it's something unique and original. I think that, these days, Eurovision is beginning to take itself a little bit too seriously, and I'm starting to really miss that particular type of Eurovision humour that entries like this can bring to the table. There's no reason to be ashamed of Eurovision's reputation for strangeness; I think we should embrace it instead. I will never not love this entry.)

4) Russia 2006 (When it comes to serious Russian entries, though, I don't think you can get much better than this. Admittedly, I quite liked Believe as well, but this song it just so much more in Dima's style, and it's also just a lot more enjoyable as a full package, not to mention being catchy as all hell. Definitely deserved its high placing.)

5) Italy 2019 (Probably recency bias at play, but this was definitely one of my favourites to win this year. Some of the other songs took some warming up to, but Mahmood had me sold upon the very first listen. Soldi is unique in its genre, it's different and daring in its cultural blend, and above all, it's really fun while also carrying emotional depth. Don't worry, Italy, you'll get a win one day...)

6) Italy 2011 (Speaking of robbing Italy, what about this one? For once, I find myself agreeing with the juries. I'm really keen on jazz, as you could probably tell, and this is about as unapologetically jazzy as you can get. Funky chord progressions, lovely instrumentation, and an enjoyable composition all add up to make what would have been a contender for a win, if it wasn't for Azerbaijan's underwhelming win.)

7) Cyprus 2018 (Now, this is a summer song incarnate. It's upbeat, danceable, and the performance helps elevate it into a completely different plane. I wasn't really blown away by any of the entries in 2018, but if one of them had to win, Fuego was definitely a big contender for me.)

8) Turkey 2010 (Not a huge fan of the genre, but when they make it work, they really make it work. Here's a very intense and very entertaining song which ended up being incredibly effective, if a little too dependent on staging. Still, I think this is one entry we won't be forgetting any time soon.)

9) Ukraine 2008 (To be honest, I preferred Dima, but for what it's worth, 2008 was quite a strong year, and this one was probably my favourite of the three very similar entries below him. The song is very infectious, the performance is full of energy, and the well-executed staging helps cement this as a timeless bop, in my eyes.)

10) Iceland 2009 (Hatari can go suck it; THIS is the Iceland I know and love. Such a beautiful ballad, with a phenomenally fantastical feel to it which is only enhanced by the superb staging. Yohanna had the incredible misfortune of competing in the same year as Rybak, but I fully believe that she would have been a winner otherwise.)

11) Russia 2015 (The hate this song got is probably my most heartbreaking Eurovision injustice. The crowd reaction was, to me, a perfect example of how many people who preach tolerance are actually only very selectively tolerant. Polina put everything into this performance, and you can sense that in every second of the song, especially the climax which is just brimming with emotion. I don't care what anyone says, this one was a stand-out of 2015, and that's really saying a lot.)

12) The Netherlands 2014 (I plead guilty to bias here, as I didn't really follow 2014 that closely seeing as how my country skipped competing, so I didn't have any proper time for this entry to grow on me. Still, even with that said, I can definitely feel the beauty of this composition emanating from the stage at all times. I will say that I'm slowly starting to warm up to it, so maybe sometime later, I'll be able to place this one a little higher.)

13) Denmark 2001 (I think this one was genuinely really fun, dated as it might be. It's got that kind of old-school charm about it that I can't help but respect. The early 00's were a mess, but I think this was kind of a diamond in the rough.)

14) Belgium 2003 (Obviously, the whole made-up language thing definitely earns it a lot of points with me, but I also quite like the semi-ethnic sound. It kind of sounds like a blend of all the cultures in Europe, and it was definitely a successful experiment in that regard.)

15) Russia 2000 (Here's a Russian entry I had all but forgotten about, and I think it's a real shame, because I quite enjoy it, for what it's worth. Somehow, it doesn't feel as dated as some of the other entries from the period.)

16) Australia 2016 (I'm really sorry about this, but this one just isn't my style. I actually like it a fair bit, it's just that I never found it that outstanding, but to its credit, I can definitely see the appeal in it. The vocal performance is phenomenal, and the chorus is actually quite memorable, so it's definitely a song that stays with you for a while. I will say this - I'd have this as a winner over Jamaletina any day.)

17) Bulgaria 2017 (Again, similar to the one above, I like it fine, but I just never got the huge appeal in it, and I like the ones above it a little better. With this one, I think it was missing that kind of spark that makes a ballad click with me. I thought it was kind of flat, in that I kind of feel like I'm waiting for the chorus throughout the entire song, and then it never actually happens. Credit where credit's due, though, Kristian's performance is impeccable.)

18) Malta 2005 (I think I can clump this one together with the two above, except I haven't got recency bias to save it. To be fair, when I really think about it, I actually find this to be even a slightly better composed ballad than Kristian's, but either way, I like it fine for what it is.)

19) Malta 2002 (Now, I don't dislike this one at all. Personally, I can listen to it just fine without getting tired of it, but I just found it kind of unremarkable overall, which is pretty fitting for such an unremarkable year. At least it's fun.)

20) Azerbaijan 2013 (Again, I wish I could say I dislike this one, but I really don't. I just find it bland, plain, and kind of forgettable. I really can't see how it managed to climb up to second place, but I guess it's just not my cup of tea.)",True,False,False,,,0,1567345687,,False,0,{},eyqk3mj,False,t3_cy8mdl,False,True,t3_cy8mdl,/r/eurovision/comments/cy8mdl/top_20_eurovision_runnerups_20002019/eyqk3mj/,False,,1575923010,1,True,[],False,eurovision,t5_2rsu8,r/eurovision,public,0,

When there‚Äôs a war, like there is in Yemen right now, our governments can claim that they are working to make things better and safer (in that particular case, by supporting Saudi Arabia all but unconditionally, the American government has probably extended rather than ameliorate suffering). At least when there‚Äôs a genocide, our governments will get a very stern look on their face and say, as they did with Burma not too long ago, ‚ÄúHey, we‚Äôre very concerned about all the genocide and ethnic cleansing you‚Äôre doing. If you keep being so naughty, we might put sanctions back on you!‚Äù All of those things, you know, might in theory lead to more serious escalation as our governments seek to at least mitigate the damage being done.

The wrought iron guns were typically made from strips of iron running along the length of the barrel being welded together, which would form the inside of the barrel. This was then reinforced by iron hoops heat shrunk onto the outside to stop the barrel from splitting along the welded seams. These reinforcing bands could form either a complete layer:

or be discrete separate bands:

* https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:40KgWroughtIronMurderer1410France.jpg

The inner strips running along the barrel and the reinforcing bands can be seen clearly in this falling-apart example:

* https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wrack_HH-Wittenbergen_Kanone_Dragge.jpg

To these, we can add that the Chinese were also casting guns in cast iron in large numbers already in the 14th century. One interesting variant was the forging of the inner barrel, followed by the casting of a reinforcing layer of cast iron around it.

The bronze guns are straightforward, although large ones presented technical problems due to their size. Some examples:

* 14th century European: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tannenbergb%C3%BCchse.jpg

* 14th century Chinese: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bronze_cannon_of_1332.jpg

* 16th century Ottoman: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Turkish_Bronze_Cannon.001_-_Tower_of_London.JPG

Very early barrels in China might be made of paper or bamboo, reinforced by being wrapped by wire or cord. These were typically for fire-lances, the gunpowder flame-thrower ancestor of the gun, but were also used for guns (and fire-lances that also shot projectiles). Wooden barrels were also used for fire-lances in Europe (presumably reinforced like the Chinese examples). Iron-reinforced and iron-lined barrels were occasionally used for cannons, with some being relatively recent:

Continuity New Labour. Factionally speaking that's the enemy, and I must stress this is all business there's no personal animus behind any of it, it's just politics. 

I don't want to boot them all out in a heroic purge - they have a right to be members - but I want to bureaucratically marginalise them, the same way the left was back when the right called the shots. 

The Labour party won 2 good election victories '97 and 2001 by moving the right, accepting the whole premise of Thatcherism and marginalising the unions/left. Then in 2005 we took big losses, the wheels were falling off New Labour even then, and then in 2010 under Brown we got smashed. 29% of the vote. After the 2008 financial crash this political space New Labour had previously existed on disappeared as electorates polarised around Europe.

We tried being nice and conciliatory with Ed Miliband, who might have been gutless but was smart enough to at least recognise the problem, especially since our European sister parties were already in the process of going through decline caused by much the same symptoms. However the right wing of the party bullied him into one concession after the other, he got monstered in the press, and we got another defeat in 2015 to thank for it. That's the problem with the soft left - *they're fucking soft!* 

So the Corbyn thing was necessary stop the rot and actually deal with the unfolding crisis that was  taking place. He was just the means to the end - didn't even want the job and to this day would probably take retirement if he could - and that was staking out the party ideologically as anti-austerity, anti-war, treat the unions as allies not enemies, strengthen party democracy and try and rebuild the movement again, after the sorry state the right had left in. 

I never expected Corbyn to win an election. The target was just to improve our share of the vote from the 30% Miliband got and hopefully pick up some new seats, to steady the ship whilst we focused on transforming the party and winning it to the left for an entire generation. We exceeded that expectation massively in 2017 and put this party back on its feet again. Corbyn could step down tomorrow and I wouldn't lose a moment's sleep but the reason he's staying is 1) we're in the midst of a major constitutional crisis and the government could collapse at any minute so Jeremy can't be making his succession plans openly he has to be a PM in waiting and 2) there's no immediate left-wing successor in place to carry on the job of party transformation. McDonnell as an interim leader with Long-Bailey as chancellor, Starmer as Home Sec instead of Abbott (whom I love and admire but should have stepped down ages ago) is doable, the members would accept that, but I don't think John wants it and it's not a long term solution.

companies will want to trade here yes, but there‚Äôs a big difference between mcdonalds/starbucks etc just having shops here and them having huge European HQ offices here that create high paying jobs, that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre going to lose if corbyn scares away businesses. 

&gt; The City extracts wealth from the rest of the economy instead of creating wealth for the economy.

this is nonsense, the city generates 10s of billions  in taxes every year. 

&gt; Ultimately this country has been run for far too long in the interests of big business and the rich and against the workers. 

Creating a friendly environment for business benefits workers by creating more opportunities for them to get jobs, France has much stricter workers rights and they also have had unemployment above 8% for 10 years (whereas were sitting at less than 4% rn), so is the French worker actually better off than the british worker?

and so did employment, incomes and productivity. im not so petty that id rather be poorer if it meant less people richer than me.

[],,viimatar,,,,[],,,,text,t2_43oaqvq3,False,False,[],"Perhaps. Without reading them, I can't really tell. I'd start with reading something about Ancient Greek mythology and traditions and see if that resonates with you or not. The next answer is Germanic Heathenry. Both have their own magical traditions that might be useful to start with. Of course, I'm somewhat biased, following a Revivalist Pre-Christian (Pagan/Heathen) religious tradition myself, but it's always better to start small with a definite frane than start too large and mix in elements that necessarily don't really fit together that well.

But - it's not always tied to your ethnic, religious, linguistic or even locally occurring traditions, paths or religious context what actually will speak to you in that sense. You might be drawn to Ancient Egyptian, African Diasporic, Taoist or Siberian Shamanistic traditions instead, and that is totally fine. Searching is fine. Even dabbling in several things at once or consequently is okay. Finding that one thing is not easy, and sometimes it takes years to find your ""own thing"". It's also possible that even if you find that one thing you will dedicate yourself to, there are other things that keep drawing you towards them - traditions, deities, practices. I'm not a huge fan of limiting oneself strictly and in my personal experience, a lot of things work well together if they all fit in personal practice and one is able to keep their respective rituals usually apart. (I imagine Norse gods would just laugh at Egyptian/Kemetic rites?)

Best advice I can give is to read a lot, but take everything with some caution and try to get a bigger picture of the scene. Historical accounts are not always helpful, as they tend to describe things from an outsider's point of view, especially so when talking about long-disappeared traditions. The Romans, or even worse, the Saxon missionaries, didn't give a good or comprehensive image of the German tribal Paganism probably. The only remaining contemporary accounts are from them, however. Sometimes it's better to start from mythologies we know from epics and then look for groups that already practice the stuff. There are quite a few of us in Europe, some even officially recognised as religious communities by a state. Even if their outlook, style or just their personality doesn't really suit you, inspiration is always free to take. Look around, google a bit, and you might find someone in your region to talk to. 

Just be careful, especially considering your young age, since there are no real gurus, just people who practice different things and some of them are stupid, some of them toxic, some of them narcissistic and abusive sexually socially or otherwise. Don't go meeting someone alone in a private place and definitely don't go along to anywhere they want to show you suddenly. If it feels strange, if you get anxious, if you feel harassed, pressured or scared, get away from them, go to a public place and get yourself safe. Also if it feels too good to be true, it probably is just that. Trust your instincts there. There are lots of good people in these groups, but also a share of those people who should not be there. For some reason, not everyone is able to handle Otherworldly stuff and stay sane, nice, or even safe for others. 

That warning said, search the Internet on how to shield and ward yourself. Any decent New Age or Witchcraft  site will give you the basics of the theory. Read a few of them and compare. Just mind, that though they tell how to create ""light bubbles"" or ""energy shields"" (same thing, different words), they rarely remember or even know to tell you the energy should be drawn from Earth itself (through your ""roots"", ""anchor"", ""grounding"" or what you choose to call it) or the surrounding free energies (be certain _not_ to draw it from other living beings or worse, some negative entities or something that gets angry because of what you did!), not to project it out from your own spiritual being.

&gt; Ghoultown is a psychobilly band from Texas, specializing in a mixture of classic Americana, Gothic music and dark, horrifying lyrics.

&gt; Formed in 1999, by vocalist/guitarist Count Lyle (Solitude Aeturnus, The Killcreeps), Ghoultown recorded its first 3-song EP in October of that same year. Titled Boots of Hell, the EP illustrated the power of the band's Tex-Mex blend while garnering rabid reviews, a fanbase and independent radio airplay. With Boots of Hell in circulation, the band's early buzz landed them several compilation appearances. The most notable being Skully Records' (NY) Gothabilly 2: Rockin' Necropolis where they share the bill with some of the best psychobilly acts around the world. As a kick off, the band was invited to participate in the world-release show held at NY's infamous CBGB's on Halloween 2000.

&gt; In early 2001, Ghoultown released their full-length debut Tales from the Dead West. The album, produced by Kol Marshall (Mercyful Fate, etc.), captured the versatility and unique sound of the Texan quintet from the powerful ""Killer in Texas"" to the Doors-esque ""Running From the Sun."" ""This album already has a place on my best of 2001 list,"" quoted a Harder Beat reviewer who reflected the positive response. Not only were ears turned, but eyes as well as the release pushed the band into new live show territory. With highlight performances such as an Atlanta benefit, which featured Jerry Only of the legendary Misfits as an onstage guest, Ghoultown has played with an amazing variety of bands such as Hank III, Rocket from the Crypt, The Independents, DRI, Bile, Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Flametrick Subs, Dick Dale, Road Kings, Men of Porn, Captured By Robots, Fear, Cruxshadows, and The Misfits.

&gt; By 2002, four of the band's songs were chosen for the soundtrack of the horror-slasher American Nightmare, starring B-movie queen Debbie Rochon (Tromeo and Juliet). The movie script was subsequently altered to include a Ghoultown performance cameo after the director witnessed the band live, and the video for their track ""Killer In Texas"" was included as a bonus on the DVD.

&gt; In the spring of 2002, the band released their follow-up Give 'Em More Rope, and Angry Planet Records signed an exclusive licensing deal with Netherlands-based Corazong Records to release the Ghoultown U.S. catalog in Europe and Canada. The first Euro-Canadian release was a special version of Tales from the Dead West, which included tracks from their Boots of Hell EP as well.

&gt; In the late summer, Ghoultown did a 35 date U.S. tour which included performances at NY's CBGBs to The Garage in L.A. The tour was concluded by a performance at one of the world's largest annual entertainment media conventions, Dragon*Con in Atlanta, where the band has performed for the last two years by popular demand.

&gt; Hitting 2003, Ghoultown's signature tune ""Killer In Texas"" made yet another appearance in a short film called Headcheese which was released on DVD with a movie called Freak. Appropriately, Headcheese was filmed in the same location as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre... house and all! Spending the first half of 2003 performing, the band toured the midwest and east coast, in addition to numerous Texas area shows. By the end of spring, Ghoultown completed work on songs for two upcoming Jon Keeyes films, Slice of Life and Hallow's End, the later in which they will also be making a cameo appearance. These are due on the market around Halloween.

&gt; In 2004, Ghoultown released a double disc set, Live From Texas!, which showcased their powerful live show on both CD and DVD. ""Ghoultown puts the grit back into rock 'n' roll with a blazing hellfire vengeance!"" said Horror Garage in praise of the release, which has garnered extremely positive feedback and become the best selling release to date.

As far as manufacturing in the EU goes. Your manufacturer will become an outsourced third party providing a service for the US company (a cost!)

You did not specify if your manufacturer will be in charge of shipping items to clients or if you'll be in need of a distribution center so I cannot expand on this.

As far as getting paid goes, you won't need a bank in the EU or even incorporate in the EU for the time being. Any credit card or PayPal charge can be credited in your USA bank account.

My advice would be to keep it as simple as possible. Once your business takes off, then start exploring In the EU, etc.  

Once you are ready for step 2, my best advice would be to create a partnership with a corp that is already established.

No, you're just a dick to animals that want nothing to do with you and you don't need to kill to survive or be healthy.

yes and then it fell and fell and fell, sometimes you have a to break a bone and reset it. 

your list of countries wage growth contains America who pulled back on the fiscal stimulus and implemented austerity in 2010 after the republicans took the house, Germany, spain and italy did austerity too. Spain, Italy and France all have massive unemployment compared to us, Spain and Italy as well have huge fiscal issues. I wouldn‚Äôt consider Poland a suitable comparison to england because their economy isn‚Äôt anywhere near as developed as ours. Japan is a very strange country to draw comparison to because their economy and demographics are so different to our own. 

&gt; Why is higher corporation tax a bad way to raise revenue?

raising the rate encourages tax avoidance, clamping down on tax avoidance pushes companies to invest less in your economies, economists on the left and right hate corporation tax. its a lousy way to tax the rich.

I am not demonizing the Chinese government. The Chinese government demonizes itself by sending tanks to massacre its people, running labor camps and harvesting organs from prisoners of conscience.

But the US doesn't put scientologists in labor camps or harvest their organs because of their belief. Scientologists can be as nutty as they want while Falon Gong practitioners can't even practice exercising in China. See the big difference between the US and communist China? 

Wrong!!! The US didn't bomb the entire country of Vietnam. It bombed the North which was communist controlled. The US helped southern Vietnam to fight against communism.

I was talking about this with my friend the other day, and I can't think of a fully correct way of handling this issue. I'm not sure if just letting those people into the country is correct though. 

""Why does country matter? There is definitely an efficient way to determine the skills of person X regardless of where he is to then designate proper education for him to fill in what he does not have.""

Their country? It doesn't matter. The receiving country? Again, it does matter, that government has a vested interest on being picky and choosy. 

Most 1st world countries have a immigration path for students (the ""proper education"" path). 

""About your second paragraph: Stop the bullshit, you specifically said the following and only it:
why does a country have any incentive to quickly let in people who ""just want to live there"" rather than significantly contribute to society?
You did not describe any other type of people that come from other countries.
I did not know your ancestry and situation and I do not really give a fuck about that, your statement was/sounded the way I described""

How does any of that warrant me being racist, xenophobic, or a bigot though? If you could get the definitions of those, and point out where exactly in my logic I am employing any of that, I'd like to know so I can better myself.

""Like there is totally no benefit from even the unskilled immigrants and like they will bring only losses."" 

Which is why it's so difficult for people to immigrate.

""Sure, they will need more initial investment to be turned into proper workforce, but this also totally depends on the type of work and their initial knowledge.""

Indeed it does. Hence why I sort by skilled and unskilled.

""You dont need to spend much money to teach someone how to pick fruits and work in harvest. ""

Are these not jobs that should be prioritized to citizens of the country first and foremost? For the less well off people who just need a job? Instead you want to bring in people to do that instead? Seems a bit exploity. 

""For electrical, plumbing and such jobs - there are many ways to teach them the basics that they need to work.""

A trade school education - something that should qualify them to enter the country if they have it, but shouldn't be the obligation for the country to teach them if they don't.

""In germany, the majority of services (electricians, painters, plumbers, construction and w.e) are not even german, they are full with polish people or people from eastern europe - many of which barely even know any german - yet they get jobs, they work, they were able to be put into companies and be productive and they were able to get the necessary education when needed.""

Europe has a fantastic boarder policy within the EU, so this is a pretty poor example with respect to the US specifically, which is essentially a locked country with Canada (whom they only allow skilled individuals legally immigrate from) and Mexico (whom they only allow skilled individuals legally to immigrate from). Also, you should provide a source on the majority being Polish, otherwise I'd have to argue that's pretty prejudiced of you to imply.

""So the matter is purely legality and not contribution to society and being skillful or not? I see. Make the immigrants legal then :)""

For pre-existing citizens, it's purely a matter of legality, they are already citizens. For non citizens, the government has an interest on being picky and choosy, and also has laws set up around immigrating legally.

You're simple misunderstanding is the ethereal, ill defined, utter nonsense that was the referendum could mean anything to everyone. In that version of Brexit, the NHS was getting ¬£350 mil per week, Free trade with the EU would be the easiest thing in human history, and Turkey was going to join the EU. 

The truth is the NHS is at breaking point and there will be no winfall, Trade deals a fucking hard, there isn't a cut in immigration, most EU citizens are getting leave to remain, and Turkey is as close to joining the EU as it ever was, ie a million miles from it (although now the UK is losing its power to veto such a move).

This is problem fantasies face when they come up against realities, and the reality is the nightmare that Brexit is turning out to be is utterly unpalatable to the vast majority of Britons, and when any true version of Brexit is put to the people poll after poll has Remain coming out on top.

A car carrying ship (6500 cars) travelling at 18 knots burns 50 tons per day of bunker oil.  Staring from Philly the trip is shortened by 6688 nautical miles, or 15.5 days of travel, 774 tons of fuel.  At 266 gallons per metric ton, that's 32 gallons per car saved.

US transport trucks average 7.3 mpg, although B-trains are less efficient around 5mpg (so I don't know where car carriers fall into that range).  Shipping by truck, 2915 miles, 5-7mpg, 583-416 gallons, 9 cars per truck, so 64-46 gallons per car.

Early EV delivery:  15 days early,  uk cars average 19.5 miles/day, @24mpg\*, 293 miles ICE driving or 12.2 gallons saved with early EV delivery.

You are only 23 and you want to live in Paris, so no wonder you can't afford any more, or are perhaps unwilling to pay more. I have lived in small rooms too because I wanted to live in the capital of expensive countries. It was a conscious choice I made and although not ideal, the good outweighed the bad for me at that time in my life.  Now I am about 10 years older than you are and I would no longer want to live in such a small place, but that's ok because I make more money now (and am soon relocating to a much cheaper part of the country).

It sounds like your mother put way too much weight on what your cousin said, and doesn't see you as an adult who can make good choices for his own life. At 23 you can put up with a lot more discomfort and lack of privacy than when you are older, and it sounds like she doesn't understand that.

Is she going to give you money so you can afford your own place, or is she expecting you to pay 95% of your income on rent or move out of Paris? In either case it should be 100% your decision where and how you live, not hers.

Your mother has extremely outdated views. I have friends who are in their mid 30's who are still living in a room in a house share. Why, you ask? Because rents are simply too expensive or not worth it, and they either can't afford more than a room and really want to stay in that city, or they choose not to spend all they can afford because they are saving towards their own home/future.

Your mother's attitude is extremely insulting and shows a total lack of understanding for people of our generation and the housing issues for us who want to/need to live in bigger cities in the west.

""You haven't even seen how I live so I think you are really jumping to conclusions here. I am only 23 and most people my age live with housemates. It's just the only way we can afford to live in bigger cities, and I want to live in a bigger city for the social as well as the professional opportunities (or education). I could live cheaper elsewhere but I can't do my job there, all my friends live in Paris too, and the bigger cities have the best career prospects. It's just what life is like these days. I don't plan to live in a small room forever but for now, I am content and I can afford it. If you think you need to dictate your adult son on how he should live, and want to either have it your way or you don't want me to be part of the last few weeks of your life, then I really don't know what to tell you. All I can say is that I will decide how to live my life myself and will not be manipulated into living a life you think I should be living. If you want to spend the last few weeks of your life being resentful and angry that your adult child can make his own decisions, be my guest.""

And then walk out. You can still go to the funeral because it's not like she's going to be there to notice you didn't listen to her.

Sorry man, she sounds like an entitled baby boomer who just doesn't understand that life is different for us than when she was 20.

PS: private rents even outside of bigger cities in western Europe are NOT cheap either, so for your 500 E (which is probably inclusive of bills etc), you may not be able to rent your own place in the countryside anyways. And then what? You need to quit your job and get a local job which may not be what you want or not at your level, may pay less, so at the end of the month after having paid all bills, you will likely end up with less money to spend than you do now. Believe me, I did the maths, and in many cases, moving away from the hustle and bustle of big city life isn't going to leave you with more spending money at the end of the month.

Se voc√™ tivesse lido o documento, teria percebido que o ""Stanford"" √© s√≥ o site da universidade onde o artigo est√° hospedado.  Como vc n√£o leu, ficar√° obviamente sem saber que o governo teve uma import√¢ncia extremamente relevante no desenvolvimento dos primeiros computadores eletr√¥nicos (seja na pesquisa direta, como foram os projetos desenvolvidos pelas For√ßas Armadas Americanas no contexto da Segunda Guerra Mundial e Guerra Fria, seja no suporte indireto atrav√©s de recursos financeiros ou de cientistas para organiza√ß√µes privadas, sem os quais certamente n√£o teria sido poss√≠vel concluir seus desenvolvimentos).

&gt;Mesma coisa Harvard, MIT. Todas institui√ß√µes privadas. As melhores universidades dos EUA s√£o particulares.

Isso de modo algum muda o que eu disse. Se voc√™ pesquisar, ver√° que todas essas universidade recebem fundos gigantescos do governo para pesquisas variadas. Se esse fundos n√£o existissem, seria muito dif√≠cil elas pagarem com os pr√≥prios bolsos pesquisas que n√£o raro beiram aos bilh√µes. Al√©m do mais, ao contr√°rio de voc√™, que afirma que o governo n√£o pesquisa **nada**, eu n√£o estou defendendo que a iniciativa privada n√£o exer√ßa, por vezes, o papel de pesquisadora (muito embora, devido a pr√≥pria natureza da pesquisa de base, isso seja bastante incomum).

N√£o √© correto que o desenvolvimento se d√™ exclusivamente por essas empresas por dois simples motivos: o primeiro -- e mais relevante, que inclusive eu ressaltei na minhas mensagens -- √© que essas empresas n√£o seriam o que s√£o se n√£o fosse o governo americano fornecendo recursos (financeiros e t√©cnicos, j√° que o desenvolvimento se d√° via de regras em bases do Estado (como a tal √Årea 51)) durante todas as etapas do projeto; o segundo, tamb√©m relevante, √© que grande parte das tecnologias que elas utilizam derivam de pesquisas promovidas pelo Estado, como √© o caso, por exemplo, das tecnologias stealth aplicadas a avia√ß√£o. Isso novamente confirma o que eu j√° disse: a iniciativa privada tem sido excelente no papel de produzir (popularizar) essas tecnologias e aprimor√°-las.

TL;DR, odds are they received at most ~$500k per person to reimburse them for the past five (six?) years of development **and have no clear revenue stream moving forward**. 

&gt; Revenue =/= profit. Steam's cut, Unreal's cut, payments to employees around the globe, working with those foreign laws, and¬†taxes. Let's imagine that Mordhau sold 2 million copies at an average cost of $29 (the game's price depends on the region and the means in which it was bought, e.g. first week sale, the 3000 kickstarter buyers, etc.).

&gt; 2,000,000 x 29 = $58,000,000

&gt; Cool, but now Steam takes 30% off of that
58,000,000 * 0.7 = 40,600,000

&gt;Then Unreal takes 5% of that
40,600,600 * 0.95 = 38,570,000

&gt;Taxes vary immensely across the various countries... but European taxes are generally a lot higher than American taxes. I don't know how corporate vs personal taxes factor into all this, but my guess is that you take that above number and reduce it by the corporate tax rate, then it is again taxed by the personal tax rate.

&gt; Corporate Tax of 20% (Slovenia at 19%, but I'm not sure how this works with Triternion having people around the globe)
38,570,000 * 0.8 = 30,856,000

&gt; This is assuming 2 million copies sold, which I don't think is the case. Over a million is confirmed, which would be $15,428,000. One and a half million would be at $23,142,000, which is probably closer to reality.

&gt; This isn't even factoring in any of the loans and debts that marox and co. almost certainly had to undertake. There was a huge rush before release to push the game out due to ""money"". The devs had to live somehow with $0 income from Q4 2014- Q2 2019. Mordhau had some very strong guerilla marketing around release, whether they had to pay the big bucks for it or not is unknown cause it's quite literally none of our business.

&gt; Then as marox allocates that ~$23,142,000 to the 11 members of the team, each of them is taxed differently based on the bracket. I think that this tax rate can be as high as 50%, so even if you were a relatively huge contributor to the team and were about to receive $1 million, that could be reduced to $500,000 that you actually get to take. This sounds like a lot, but considering you weren't paid for 4.5 years, this averages to an annual income (not gross revenue) of $110,000. Certainly still good by most people's standards, but you weren't able to spend any of that for 4.5 years +¬†this isn't your income anymore¬†unless Mordhau miraculously sells at a static rate of 1.5 million copies per year. Certainly far from being able to retire.¬†

&gt;... 

&gt; As already mentioned, chances are that Mordhau already made of the majority of the amount of money it will ever make (unless it explodes again with some significant patch, which is possible and hopefully what happens - CSGO erupted with the skins update, Blizzard games had expansion packs which are just today's version of 2.0.1 and 3.0.1 patches, Minecraft took a few years to truly explode, Rainbow 6 Siege was more successful quite a bit post-launch than on release). The¬†income¬†of the company isn't $20 mil per year, but probably rather low now that the game has settled down and dried out. Yet, the salaries of all 11 employees must still be paid. In addition to that are server and upkeep costs.

It most definitely is the case. I have quoted the exact text of the decision, with its underlined emphasis on ""military"" targets.

&gt;The decision was made before the bombing of Rotterdam, which was used just as an excuse.

That's wrong as well. The War Cabinet met on 14 May and agreed: 

&gt;To take no decision in the meantime in 
regard to the employment of our heavy 
bomber force.

They were certainly under pressure from the RAF to act, and I am sure would have done so sooner or later. After all, the Luftwaffe was busy bombing targets all over France, Belgium and the Netherlands (and had already bombed Norway), so it was inevitable Bomber Command would begin attacks on Germany. But the government met on the 14th and refused to change policy, they met on the 15th and did so.

&gt;The targets were nominally to be military objectives, but locating even cities was very difficult at night, let alone military targets within them.

Yes. The same was true of daylight operations, of course. On the afternoon of 10 May 3 Luftwaffe bombers, which had set out to bomb Dijon in France, became lost and instead attacked Freiburg in Germany, killing 57 civilians. And on the 9/10 May, just as the attack on France, Belgium and the Netherlands was beginning, 1 Luftwaffe aircraft dropped incendiary bombs in a field outside Canterbury in southern England. They were almost certainly meant for a target in France or Belgium, but bombing was inaccurate. 

But the problem is you are applying different standards to the RAF and Luftwaffe. The Luftwaffe carried out attacks on enemy territory in Poland, Norway, France, Belgium and the Netherlands, by both night and day, before the RAF carried out its first attacks on Germany. Yet you want to portray RAF attacks as deliberate attacks on cities (when the orders are absolutely clear they weren't), and German attacks as aimed at precise military targets.

&gt;Overy went through Cabinet records and says the papers he found prove that without doubt.

I'd be very interested. I can also quote to you the War Cabinet meeting of 15 September, and the RAF's response:

The War Cabinet:
&gt;The bombing of London had been quite indiscriminate and the view was expressed that our raiders over Germany ought to be instructed not to return home with their bombs, if they failed to locate the targets which they were detailed to attack.

The response from Archibald Sinclair, Secretary of State for Air:

&gt;Dear	 Prime Minister, In Conclusion 1 (i) of the minutes of 
yesterday's War Cabinet Meeting I am invited ""to give 
instructions that our bombers operating over Germany 
should not return with their bombs in the event of 
their failing to locate their targets"". 
I find that an instruction had already been 
issued to Bomber Command that pilots should make every 
effort to avoid bringing their bombs home and I attach 
a copy of our signal. It does not, however, go so 
far as the Cabinet Conclusion in that it permits pilots 
to bring home their bombs in the last resort if they 
cannot find any military target. I think it would 
be unwise to go further than this instruction. 
(a)	 Because our present policy is to bomb 
only military objectives and this 
was re-emphasised at this morning's 
Cabinet.

&gt;I do not propose therefore to issue any 
further instruction to Bomber Command but I should be 
glad of your approval. 
Yours sincerely, 
(Signed) ARCHIBALD SINCLAIR.

Churchill replied ""This may stand for the present"".

That's the 15 September, when the Blitz had been going on for more than a week, with several thousand civilians killed in the UK by Luftwaffe bombing.

&gt;I don't have the book right now with me but can post the relevant quote tomorrow if you are interested.

From Overy, The Bombing War

&gt;On 15 May the Cabinet finally took the decision to approve a full bombing strategy against German targets where civilians might be casualties, as long as they were ""suitable military objectives"".

&gt;The change in priorities necessitated a revision of the rules on the conduct of air warfare laid down in August 1939, which had mite it illegal to attack targets in which civilians might be ""negligently"" killed. On 4 June 1940 the Air Ministry issued new guidelines for Bomber Command, cancelling the earlier instructions. The intention of killing civilians was still regarded as a violation of international law, but attacks could be made on military targets ""in the widest sense"" (factories, shipyards, communications, power supply, oil installations) in which civilian casualties would be unavoidable but should be proportional. ""Undue loss of civil life"" was still to be avoided, which meant returning to base or jettisoning bombs safely if the target could not be properly identified.

So what is your contention? That before 15 May the Germans had not bombed targets that could have resulted in the loss of civilian life? That would be a preposterous argument. At the very least the Luftwaffe had bombed without regard for civilian life, even if it hadn't stepped over the line into deliberately targeting civilians (my own belief is that it had in Poland, but I don't know enough about that campaign to argue). 

At every stage the RAF only responded to German escalations. The RAF was forbidden to attack anything other that warships at sea until March 1940, when a Luftwaffe attack on the Orkney Islands killed a British civilian (James Isbister). As a response the RAF attacked the seaplane base on the island of Hornum. 

The RAF first attacked German transport targets west of the Rhine in response to the German attack on France, Belgium and the Netherlands (which included bombing attacks). They first began attacks on military targets elsewhere in Germany in response to not just Luftwaffe attacks across western Europe, but the specific attack on Rotterdam, which showed the Luftwaffe would have no regard for the number of civilian casualties they were prepared to inflict in order to secure their objectives.

The RAF first began attacks on military targets of opportunity in mid September, following the start of the Blitz on British cities. They carried out their first area attack on a German city in December 1940, following the attack on Coventry and with 20,000 British civilians dead from German bombing.",True,False,False,,,0,1567370469,,False,0,{},eyrjsrp,False,t3_cy4py2,False,False,t1_eyre3d0,/r/europe/comments/cy4py2/on_this_day_exactly_80_years_ago_german/eyrjsrp/,False,,1575940499,7,True,[],False,europe,t5_2qh4j,r/europe,public,0,

* blackheads around my T zone - nose, forehead, temple
* whiteheads
* ingrown facial hair
* the whole skin is kind of textured
* dark circles under eyes

Until recently I washed my face with water and thoroughly dry it with towel almost every morning and night - sometimes I'd skip some days hh. My face would usually feel dry first tens of minutes and then gradually get oily before another cleaning routine.

So now I decided to start caring for my face more. My ultimate goal is to 

1. **look forever young**
2. **energize face**
3. **get rid of dark circles**
4. eye care to prevent eye bags

I read about essentials for men are some product to wash your face and then moisturizer. I wash my face and then moisturize everyday morning and night (starting 2w ago).

* To wash my face I started using [Balea Men Washing Gel - Clean&amp;Care](https://german-drugstore.com/product/men/men-skincare/balea-men-washing-gel-clear-care-150ml/) \- my face would feel really dry, tight and tense after washing
* For moisturizing I used [Cien Men Hydro Care 24h Moisturiser](https://world.openbeautyfacts.org/product/20516482/hydro-care-cien), [ingredients](https://world.openbeautyfacts.org/images/products/20516482/4.jpg)
* Today I switched to using a day cream after washing my face [Cien Men Q10](https://www.quechoisir.org/comparatif-ingredients-indesirables-n941/cien-men-q10-intensive-anti-wrinkle-cream-pi34796/)

After adapting this routine my face would still get oily especially during the day. It is weirdly glowing like a polished car throwing reflections - I have no idea if it's good or not but I am hating this. Would much prefer a matte difuzed look on my skin. 

Am I using correct products? What can I add to the routine?

Basically this is what ""catch and release"" was all about. Crossing the border without permission is a misdemeanor, and this administration decided to make that a jailable offense, unlike past administrations who would send families back from whence they came. *This* decision to jail is what lead (on purpose) to family separation, children in cages, and the current shitshow at the border, because under US law kids can't be put in jail with adults. In other words, the difference between Trump and past administrations is that they are making a conscious decision to separate families (and now want to hold children indefinitely) as a deterrent to crossing our border. 

As a matter of fact, originally there was no documentation kept of any separations, no way to re-unify these families until a class action lawsuit from parents was decided in their favor, which is why you saw a scramble to do DNA testing to reunite children with their parents. The upshot of all of this is that yes, people like Stephen Miller (and Steve Bannon) see brown people as an assault on ""Western European Christian values"", and are doing everything they can to deter it, while spreading disinformation to make them seem less less racist, radicalizing ICE, and bending the law as far as it can be bent. Anyway, children in cages is new, it sucks, and that's why everybody is upset. 

By the way, the stuff about Miller and Bannon is out of their own mouths, although mostly they see us in a war with Islam, it's obvious from the demonization of our southern neighbors how this administration feels about them. Fun fact: we are -2,000,000 Mexicans over the last decade or so. A net loss, and yet Trump feels the need to call it an invasion and people buy that bologna.

America is for anyone and everyone who wants to be here. I think the large number of people living here ""undocumented"" is a sign of a larger issue with our immigration and border policies.

There is, generally speaking, three kinds of borders. Open, controlled, and closed. The American-Mexian border is, at the moment, technically a controlled border, but is much closer to a closed border (eg. The Koreas or the Berlin Wall) than an open one (eg. Most of Europe).

On a controlled border scale of 1-10 (with 0 being open and 11 being closed) I feel like we're somewhere around 8 or 9. I think we should dial it back to, like, a 2.

Basically it should be significantly easier to cross than it is now but still somewhat more difficult than driving from Chicago to Milwaukee. Tightening restrictions has only made the issue more fervent. I believe we can have a mildly controlled border with little to no issues.

Gibraltar authorities were finally pushed to releasing the tanker but 24 hours before its release the white house issued a request to seize the vessel which thankfully did not go through.

Mas num passado n√£o muito remoto (pense 20-30 anos), eram colonia/territ√≥rio brit√¢nico.

Ent√£o, apesar de serem etnicamente chineses, esse pessoal cresceu com valores do oeste, tanto culturalmente como politicamente.

A√≠, como parte de acordo entre o Reino Unido e a China, Hong Kong passou a ser territ√≥rio chines, e desde ent√£o, a China tem feito de tudo pra ir aos poucos erodindo isso.

Ent√£o, por exemplo: Hong Kong tem elei√ß√£o pr√≥pria pra determinar seus governantes, MAS, quem define os candidatos √© o partido comunista chin√™s. Ent√£o no fim das contas, voc√™ vota num fantoche.

Por ser territ√≥rio, HK manteve v√°rias liberdades que os chineses n√£o tem, como por exemplo -- l√° o acesso √† maioria das plataformas de midia social n√£o √© bloqueada (como √© na China), MAS, o governo chines fica de olho no que voc√™ posta online.

--

Pois bem, qual o fato gerador dos protestos de hoje em dia, uma vez que isso que eu passei um tempo escrevendo n√£o √© nada de novo?

--

O que mudou foi que a China passou uma lei, recentemente, qu e d√° a ela total poder de extradi√ß√£o sob os habitantes de Hong Kong, pra China, pra responder criminalmente contra algumas a√ß√µes/atitudes.

E pra foder tudo, a lei foi escrita de maneira extremamente vaga e amb√≠gua, dando a entender que pode/vai ser totalmente abusada pelo governo Chines, usando ela como pretexto pra mandar pra China quem ela quiser, por qualquer motivo obscuro, e essa pessoa vai simplesmente ""ser desaparecida"" por l√°, e ningu√©m vai saber o que aconteceu com ela.

--

A√≠ voc√™ tem, de um lado, o pessoal de Hong Kong, que n√£o quer ""ser ref√©m"" desse tipo de coisa, e n√£o quer ter as suas liberdades retiradas, e do outro, voc√™ tem o governo Chines, que TEM Hong Kong como parte do seu territ√≥rio, e, de certa maneira, n√£o pode tolerar esse tipo de movimento dentro do seu pr√≥prio pa√≠s, pra n√£o enfraquecer a sua soberania sob seus territ√≥rios.

--

Quem t√° certo?

Pra mim, tinha que separar logo, HK virar o seu pr√≥prio pa√≠s, e dar bye/wave pra China.

A China, √≥bvio, n√£o vai querer isso nunca, porque eles enchem o cu de dinheiro com todos os impostos que conseguem tirar de l√°.

--

E, pra infelicidade do pessoal de HK, ningu√©m vai querer comprar uma briga abertamente com a China por causa deles.

Protectionism as a whole is bad for trade. The entire purpose of the world's main trading organisation is to stop this. There are exceptions in a few small areas and situations, but high tariffs on foods is not one of them. Our farmers don't need protecting. Our automotive industry (such that it is) doesn't need protecting. This is the fallacy of most remain voters - we need zero trade protection from the EU because they are nice and soft and fluffy, but we need big trade protection from every other country because they are bad and smelly and made from slugs. So answer me this - far more cars are made in the EU than the UK; why doesn't our automotive industry need protecting from the EU? Our farmers don't produce nearly as much as the EU; why don't they need protecting from it? Overall your low effort disengenious questions (that you absolutely thought were gotcha moments) have just revealed you to be anti-free trade. At least where it suits you.

I bet you thought your claim on working in IT was a gotcha moment too, but sadly for you I wasn't pretending to know about GDPR so I know how little IT knows about it beyond a project spec.

In physical geography, a steppe (Russian: —Å—Ç–µ–ø—å, IPA: [st ≤ep ≤]) is an ecoregion, in the montane grasslands and shrublands and temperate grasslands, savannas and shrublands biomes, characterized by grassland plains without trees apart from those near rivers and lakes. The prairie of North America (especially the shortgrass and mixed prairie) is an example of a steppe, though it is not usually called such. A steppe may be  semi-arid or covered with grass or shrubs or both, depending on the season and latitude. The term is also used to denote the climate encountered in regions too dry to support a forest but not dry enough to be a desert.

***

**Eurasian nomads**

The Eurasian nomads were a large group of nomadic peoples from the Eurasian Steppe, who often appear in history as invaders of Europe, the Middle East and China.

The generic title encompasses the varied ethnic groups who have at times inhabited the steppes of Central Asia, Mongolia, and what is now Russia. They domesticated the horse around 3500 BC, vastly increasing the possibilities of nomadic life, and subsequently their economy and culture emphasised horse breeding, horse riding and nomadic pastoralism; this usually involved trading with settled peoples around the steppe edges.  They developed the chariot, wagon, cavalry and horse archery and introduced innovations such as the bridle, bit and stirrup, and the very rapid rate at which innovations crossed the steppelands spread these widely, to be copied by settled peoples bordering the steppes.

I'd rather study this thought process of yours in a vacuum that doesn't rely on, ""here's why a different idea is worse."" I would like an argument of, ""here's why this idea is so strong that other people might have a tough time to challenge it.""

I‚Äôm happy to do that. See, when most people think of communism, they think of Russia or China, which did have many successes, but also had many failures, both real and perceived(and in some cases just exaggerated or made up) that are used as arguments against the idea. Usually those failures are also analyzed in a vacuum, that is, they don‚Äôt also weigh the successes with those failures in any level, and also ignore many factors that caused those situations. The Holodomor famine in Ukraine is a very popular argument against communism, that soviet policies caused the famine in the Ukraine, but this isn‚Äôt the whole truth, and also ignores(quite intentionally) important historical context. In those times, famines happened in that area of Europe multiple times every decade, and were always terrible for the population. The reason this particular famine was so bad, was because the ruling class in the Ukraine, opposed to the new collectivization policies the soviet government was implementing, either burned or stashed their entire harvests to deny the population what they wanted for themselves. And of course, a famine hit at the same time, making the results of this absolutely devastating to the population of Ukraine. This may have been ‚Äúprovoked‚Äù by the collectivization policies, but the fault still lies on the rich elites in Ukraine adopting a scorched earth policy in response. It‚Äôs also important to note that the soviet government also did as much as they could to mitigate the effects this would have on the population. They diverted a lot of grains and agriculture produced in mainland Russia to the Ukraine, but still millions died. I would argue that the conclusion people reach about the holodomor is the opposite: that famine would have been way worse if it wasn‚Äôt for the soviet response to it. In that vein, they also introduced agricultural policies in the years following, and because of that, the Ukraine never saw a single famine again, where they were about a tri annual occurrence.

I don‚Äôt wanna just address criticisms, I only went into that example to show how the perceived failures of communism are often either exaggerated or blatantly misrepresented. I‚Äôd rather talk about the successes to satisfy your wish to analyze the pros of communism in a vacuum. So from here on that‚Äôs what I will do.

Before the 1917 revolution, Russia was a backwater feudal state that had little relevance in the world. Ten years after the revolution, they went on to become a world power, rivaling the us, becoming instrumental to defeating the nazis(many, including myself, argue that Russia was the biggest lone factor in their defeat). This was done alongside rapidly expanding women‚Äôs rights in ways that the us hadn‚Äôt done until recent decades and in some ways still hasn‚Äôt done(they literally ended the wage gap lol), expanded literacy rates by up to 700% by some accounts, industrializing at ungodly speed, being completely unaffected by the Great Depression etc. and that‚Äôs just Russia. I‚Äôm gonna move on to Cuba now, as they‚Äôre actually the best shining example of communism‚Äôs successes.

So Cuba. They went from being a us puppet tourist sexslave island, to being a major player in global south politics. Despite an embargo for half of a century, they became a fully self sustained nation, to the point where they‚Äôre actually the ONLY country in the world that has an acceptable human development index while also not consuming more than their fair share of resources. That balance of human quality of life vs climate protection on its own is an astoundingly good argument for the success of communism, but Cuba doesn‚Äôt stop there. They completely eliminated child malnutrition, to the point being recognized by UNICEF as being the only country to do this. They have a world class healthcare system that is so good, that the doctors often have nothing to do so Cuba sends them out on missions to third world countries and are considered one of the biggest exporters of medical aid/relief to suffering countries. Their medical research has gotten them to the point where they are researching cancer vaccines that actually show promise and effect. They completely outlawed homelessness. And by that I don‚Äôt mean they throw homeless people in jail. They made it a law that the government is held responsible for anyone ending up homeless, and are responsible to help anyone homeless and give them shelter and out of the situation. Because of this, Cuba has an 85% HOMEOWNERSHIP rate, as in, 85% of the population, OWN their own homes. That‚Äôs a huge number on its own, in a vacuum, but if we were to put that metric up to capitalist countries it WOULD show a lot more, but I‚Äôm gonna avoid going there on that.

Some of the stuff I‚Äôm saying here might sound crazy but feel free to fact check it. I‚Äôm on my tablet so providing links is a pain in the ass for me, otherwise I would provide them myself. A good resource if you want to look into it is if you go to r/communism, and search up their ‚Äúdebunking myths‚Äù thread. Actually, I‚Äôm gonna go over there right now to copy the link, wait for my edit and I‚Äôll put it here. Mind you, it‚Äôs obviously biased pro communism, but it‚Äôs filled with scholarly writings.

&gt; Dreaming is a traditional Doom metal band from Zschopau, Germany in the vein of St. Vitus or perhaps Witchfinder General, but with a slightly more positive feel to it; heavy riffing and slighty ""hollow sounding"" melodramatic clean vocals with some tendencies towards stoner.
Founded in summer 1993, they gave their first concert in 1994.
The current line-up consists of Sandro Uhlmann (guitars, vocals), Thomas Becker (drums) and Thomas Schulz (bass, vocals).

&gt; The demo ""Smirten Pr√∏ben"" was released in 1994 with  200 copies sold and is now available for download here.
They've done a lot of gigs with bands like Naevus, Mirror of Deception, Dawn of Winter, Solitude Aeturnus, Morgana Lefay amongst others.

&gt; In fall/winter 1998 recording sessions for the first full album ""T√Ω V√∏l≈ì√Ω"" were started, which
has been released on October 1st 1999.

&gt; Further shows in 2000/2001 with Solstice, The Lord Weird Slough Feg, Warning and Jack Frost.

&gt; In spring 2001 a new song from the forthcoming album has been released on the ""Psychedelic"" compilation and  ‚ÄúThe Warstarter‚Äù was recorded for the ""St. Vitus Tribute"" on RavenMoonRecords.
In 2003 they played at the first European Doom festival ""Doom Shall Rise""  and in 2004 at the ""Autumn of Doom Festival"" with Reverend Bizarre, Officium Triste, Mirror Of Deception, Jack Frost, Rise and Shine and Whispering Gallery.

&gt; Their latest full-length album is simply called ""II"" and saw light of day in 2006.

As it mobilizes people rather than potentially overwhelming them. Sadly the media has latched onto the existential threat narrative and politicians have fed into this (trying to get eyeballs on the issue) creating a feedback loop. They aren't wrong to call it an existential threat if we don't act, it's just not the most effective way to frame the issue.

[Here is a good video for communicating about climate change to try and actually mobilize action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-oaYz3Jexs).

My main criticism of this video is that it focuses largely on individual actions and is rather defeatist on any action being taken by political leadership (too much psychology, not enough sociology). Think if you had taken this approach to JFK's moonshot, nothing would have happened as the endeavor was too big. Ditto for FDR's New Deal. These were paradigm shifts. The challenge for the Green New Deal is that it must combine the broad based economic movement of the New Deal, which was eased by a huge economic collapse and a hugely mobilized labor movement, with the shear political will that was the moonshot, that led to massive shifts in societal priorities from scratch by placing value on STEM education and pursuing the future for its own sake.

This is kind of what David talks about all the time with Trump. The people you need to convince aren't the deniers, but the base and those that are undecided or uncertain what to do. Bernie's proposal for the [Green New Deal](https://berniesanders.com/issues/the-green-new-deal/), or at least a policy proposal like it, is the perfect option as it gives a clear and concrete goal that we can frame with the grand narrative structure Stokes outlines in the first video or this [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5h6ynoq8uM).

The main point is we need a story centered around ideas such as ecological stewardship (more religious/ethical overtones), the good life (move away from consumption and focusing on human flourishing \[think UBI and cooperatives\]), re-wilding (let nature come back into balance), or green growth (soc dem version focusing on changing capitalism to work better with limited resources).

Now for your actual question.

**Why Climate Change is an Existential Threat:**

The  [IPCC's actual claim was that we need a 45% reduction in our CO2 emissions by 2030 in order to hit carbon neutral by 2050 (to stay at 1.5 celsius)](https://www.climaterealityproject.org/blog/2030-or-bust-5-key-takeaways-ipcc-report). The problem is that we are still debating if this is even an issue right now. Not, what is the best way to approach this, but is it even an issue. It should also be pointed out that the IPCC usually gives out pretty conservative estimates of the models to avoid being called hysterical.

The scenario you outline only happens if we can keep the warming within [1.5-2 celsius](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNgqv4yVyDw), however this video doesn't account for was the human reaction to the changes. The Syrian refugee crisis was [likely exacerbated by climate instability](https://climateandsecurity.org/2015/09/10/on-syrian-refugees-and-climate-change-the-risks-of-oversimplifying-underestimating-the-connection/). This crisis as well as the slow recovery from the 2008 crash arguably helped to contribute to the rise of authoritarians across Europe. And we have seen something similar in the US with [refugees](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/12/04/the-crisis-in-honduras-should-matter-to-the-u-s/) [fleeing Honduras](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/how-climate-change-is-fuelling-the-us-border-crisis), leading to the adoption of a much more fascistic/militaristic political landscape.

This problem is likely only going to get worse, and we have also seen an uptick in willingness to deploy nuclear weapons from countries including the US, Russia, India, Pakistan, and North Korea. There is a very real chance someone might get desperate and use these if put under enough pressure. We also fail to account that this level of peace is not the norm of human history and if we go to war much of our innovative capacity will redirect toward that endeavor potentially diverting away from climate change at the most critical juncture. This isn't that far fetched as that is what we are already doing right now in the US despite the military declaring climate instability as a leading national security threat.

[We need to lay down the infrastructure before we ever get to the point where we experience the problems to begin with or it will likely already be too late](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGJJs_nTow8). Even at 2 celsius around 5-14% of the world's GDP could be erased as  [cities are underwater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvJ412PxHR0),  [crops lands get dried out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SModhHUpcj0), and precipitation and biomes shift across the world.

Sadly, as it stands we are on track to go all the way to  [4.3 celsius](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17aE91SBMoY) if we do nothing. That my friend is indeed much more apocalyptic. What the IPCC doesn't necessarily account for is that the models cannot account for the random introduction of tipping points. For instance, few models were likely accounting for a massive acceleration in deforestation of the Amazon due to human activity which is a major carbon sink, or the [fires that have started in the drying Arctic peat bogs in North America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4AczmNQByY) (at least this soon). God forbid that we see any volcanic chains become active or major eruptions due to flood basalts in the next thousand years on top of everything else.  [These all trigger positive feedback cycles much sooner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiZlBspV2-M),

The existential threat is not necessarily for any generation alive today, but rather any that we might want to come after. If we do nothing the current generations will likely survive in just the hellish landscape you predicted, but the downstream consequences may become so severe that our technology won't be enough to put the genie back in the bottle in time. Even with massive carbon sinking efforts we are talking about the scale of decades for the problem to reverse itself as glaciers don't reform overnight nor will the atmosphere start to clear.

That is the thing we suck at accounting for, the shear scale of the problem ([known as a hyperobject](https://youtu.be/CqCx9xU_-Fw?t=378) ). It is almost too large to really comprehend, hence why we have to create models to map the problem. However the problem is so damned big with so many interplaying factors that if you miss even a few your model is likely under estimating the results, which is often what we see happening, especially as some of the feedbacks kick in.

Even at 2 celsius the estimates for the loss of ecological services provided number in the trillions per year in world output and range from changes to the water cycle, nitrogen fixation, the carbon cycle, pollination, oxygen production, temperature regulation, etc, etc. Here is a study that looks at the rough value provided by biome ([Global estimates of the value of ecosystems and their services in monetary units](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212041612000101#s0105)) with all services valued at around [$44 trillion per year](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3339477/). [Protecting these environments therefore can bring amazing returns on investment](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-10/d-wac101509.php), but in the short term seems expensive as who should be responsible for footing the initial bill if the whole world might stand to benefit. We are directly seeing this question play out with Balsanaro and the Amazon in Brazil.

The problem is the rate at which the climate is changing. As humans we think 100 years sound like forever as that is a long single lifetime. However we are talking planetary scales and at that rate this is insane. That and there are always lags to the actual changes as the world reaches a new equilibrium. The effects we are talking about will come at an accelerating pace as more carbon hits the atmosphere but the full effects of what is already in the air will probably take a decade to fully manifest.

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsA3PK8bQd8) gives you an idea why most of the public on the left is freaking out, however it assumes that we change nothing in our current technology or culture. The problem is that this video communicates in a way that may make people become more insular and tribalistic as it is largely mobilizing fear tactics. This is precisely the opposite effect you want, as it is a lack of collective effort when we approach a problem this big that will make us fail. However, it does do a good job of outlining why individual action isn't going to be enough without a large social or political movement. [Another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHdcpxmJ6vg) that suffers from a similar problem but outlines another important point that many of the largest companies have known this was a problem since the 80s though the scientific community has [known for much longer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_climate_change_science).

Take Tibet for example. The CCP have a policy of importing Han Chinese (the ethnic majority in China) to Tibet to try and ethnically and culturally replace the Tibetan people. Allegedly a similar policy exists in Xinjiang with the Uighur. Those regions are (currently) majority Tibetan/Uighur, but it's perfectly reasonable for Tibetans or Uighur to be concerned about this demographic change, and oppose the Han migration. That doesn't make them racist, in my book.

The same applies everywhere. It's OK for Native Americans / First Nations to be concerned about their  dropping demographic percentage of the North American total. I also think it's OK for European Americans to be concerned about the same issue, even though they are (currently) the majority. In a democracy, people tend to vote somewhat tribally, often aligning with their race, and clearly being a minority isn't great in this context. In fact, democracy or not, minorities around the world do relatively poorly economically and socially; look at the Rohingya muslims, or African Americans, or Jamaican British, or Nepalese in Japan, or Jews in Europe (historically) etc etc. Clearly, it's perfectly rational and reasonable to be anxious about being or becoming a minority, and that anxiety doesn't equal racism.

Note that I don't endorse weird conspiracy theories: I know there are strange claims that there exists a sinister cabal engineering the downfall of the 'White Race' or whatever, and I don't believe that for a second. At any rate, the opposite cabal (white supremacists) exists and is quite influential. However, if you're white and you're seeing your community or country's demographics shift away from majority white, you can expect a decrease in your relative political power (and cultural power, and maybe economic power too), and it's totally understandable to be nervous about that, and you're not a racist for worrying about it or for opposing the change. You may be a bit selfish, but that's not the same as being racist or evil - everyone's selfish. Expressing this demonstrably rational concern should not be hate speech.

To be more explicit about why this isn't racism: Wanting to remain the majority isn't the same as hating other ethnic groups. It's simply commonsense self-preservation of power, influence, and maybe even safety. Now, what people do with that desire often does stray into racism, no doubt about that, but recognising that 'it is probably worse to be fewer than to be more' does not make you an evil racist.",True,False,False,,,0,1567393957,,False,0,{},eysctcj,False,t3_c5tvi2,False,True,t3_c5tvi2,/r/unpopularopinion/comments/c5tvi2/racism_megathread/eysctcj/,False,,1575954288,3,True,[],False,unpopularopinion,t5_2tk0s,r/unpopularopinion,public,0,

If not, what does it mean? Did Napoleon really promote Meritocracy (at least in the early days and in his overall legacy)? 

Napoleon was a reactionary, someone who was against the democratic ideals of the young republic, but not like the Thermidorians who merely preferred a more moderate liberal regime than Robespierre's or the royalists who wanted to restore the ancien regime. Napoleon wanted to both go back and forward. As he so famously proclaimed, ""I am the successor, not of Louis XVI, but of Charlemagne."" The society he would establish was going to be hierarchical and anti-democratic but it was also more meritocratic, tolerant, and just than his predecessors. 

&gt;Did Napoleon really promote Meritocracy (at least in the early days and in his overall legacy)?

Yes and no. He was meritocratic in a lot of ways (and most of the ways that were probably most important to his goals) but he also was guilty of nepotism at times and this backfired pretty bad. His brothers were nowhere near as gifted as him.

&gt;Did Nietzsche also like Napoleon because he himself was a committed Pan-European Cosmopolitanist who wanted a United Europe (being opposed to nationalism)?

Yes, see aphorism 377 of *The Gay Science* and aphorism 208 of *Beyond Good and Evil*. He was a pan-European nationalist. 

&gt;What is a ‚Äúpost structuralist soft-peddler?‚Äù 

Post-structuralism is a term which covers the thinkers who critiqued (or arguably, continued) structuralism. It's not really a unified movement or school of thought but generally speaking, post-structuralists tends to deal a lot with language, the text, and the deconstruction of binaries. Post-structuralism has a lot of overlap with postmodernism. Most thinkers associated with it are/were very egalitarian and libertarian. Foucault, Derrida, and Butler are a few of the most famous. Most of them are influenced by Nietzsche but only take from his destructive side. They use the hammer he swung at Christianity, nationalism, and tradition but reject what he wanted to build atop the ruins.

&gt;What is a ‚Äúultra-reactionary 

A reactionary is one who wants to return to a previous state of society. The term comes from the Thermidorian reaction, the counter-revolution against Robespierre, but it is now generally used to refer to those with illiberal ultraconservative political beliefs. 

&gt;neo-Platonist socially?‚Äù 

Off the top of my head, I can't recall Nietzsche ever saying much about the Neoplatonists. Another user has said they think the author is comparing Nietzsche's political beliefs to those put forward in *The Republic*. That might be the case but if it is, ""neo-Platonist"" was a poor choice of words.

&gt;What is a ‚Äúneo-Machiavellian  

Well, Nietzsche did say in the chapter of *Ecce Homo* titled ""Why I Write Such Excellent Books"" that he considered Cesare Borgia to be closer to his ideal than Parsifal and Borgia was the inspiration for *The Prince*. Nietzsche wanted more artist-tyrants, leaders who could wield power with fury if they need to but also had excellent tastes in the arts. With that said, it should be noted that another man Nietzsche admired, Frederick the Great, wrote *Anti-Machiavel*, a response to *The Prince*. Frederick was an enlightened absolutist, someone who thought he as king should have unquestioned power but also be duty-bound to help his people. He saw his position as ""the first servant of the state"". Frederick was also a brilliant tactician (Napoleon visited his tomb after defeating Prussia and remarked that if Fredrick were still alive, he would not be there) as well as a gifted flute player and patron of philosophers and artists. 

&gt;synarchic 

This usually either means harmonious or some kind of conspiratorial, shadow government. I can't remember Nietzsche saying anything about his ideal ruling caste governing only in secret.

&gt;trans-national 

He wanted the unification and merging of European peoples. I wouldn't use the term trans-national because it implies being ""across nations"" instead of the coalescing of nations. 

&gt;elitist?‚Äù

He was an elitist. Nietzsche cared mostly about the cultivation of great individuals and saw the masses as incompetent, incapable of properly ruling, and mediocre.

&gt;What is a ‚Äúexpositor of ‚Äúesoteric‚Äù caste hierarchy based on culture and spirit?‚Äù

Well, he was an esoteric moralist, meaning that he did not believe that one morality fit everyone right and that great individuals should not be bound by the same codes and value systems that bind the herd. That might be what they are talking about or this could be referring again to secret government thing, which I can't recall anything about. By a caste based on culture and spirit, this is referring to Nietzsche's desire to see a new aristocracy established, one which would fit his ideal of valiant artist tyrants, geniuses of culture and war.

&gt; 
&gt; To name a single example, Marx celebrated the US conquest of Mexico, using openly racist terms to contrast the ‚Äúenergetic‚Äù Yankees with the lazy and ‚Äúprimitive‚Äù Mexicans. His idea of dialectical progress shared the element of white supremacy with the liberalism of the day. He was convinced that the Western nations were the most advanced in the world and that all the other peoples would have to emulate Europe and follow the same path to liberate themselves. As such, he was an unapologetic defender of colonialism, which he recognized as an exercise of capitalist violence, but which he also believed was vital to the progress of ‚Äúprimitive‚Äù peoples.

The historical process of fuedalism&gt;mercantalism&gt;captialism&gt;socialism&gt;communism is kind of hard to square with being anti-colonial in his era, yeah. I don't see many places in the global south leaving feudal agrarianism without colonialism...

However, just because Marx held personally racist views on some issues doesn't mean white supremacy is inherent to or expressed in Marxism

[],,[deleted],,,,,,,dark,,,,,[],"&gt;First of all is mobility. Europe geography is generally flat. In Asia and Africa, geography is a nightmare: jungle, mountains, deep gorge and river. Not to mention the vast tropical rainforest, which is a nightmare to cross. Ask the Japanese/English/French/American/Australian about their experiences. The landmass is also greater and therefore you need to travel further to find your enemy. Having a large, bronze or iron shield will not help you move very fast or for very long. Now that is not to say that they do not use iron or bronze shield: they did. This leads us to the second issue.

This is not true. Indeed, the Greek terrain where hoplites originated are noted to be particularly hilly and mountainous.

Hoplites were as much a cultural institution as it was a troop type associated with specific terrain. That's why the colonies the Greeks setup all over the Med had Hoplite-type troops, and why the Persians (who were heavily interlinked with the Greeks, rather than being distant foreign conquerors) also employed Hoplite mercenaries. Persia moreover was not some ""vast tropical rain forest"" or some other kind of geographical nightmare to cross. Indeed, it's often noted by various historians that the best forces raised by the Persians was cavalry - a troop type not well suited in the rainforest or other kinds of rough terrain, while the Greeks avoided raising cavalry precisely because the horses were more ineffective in the Greek hillsides. 

And in any case the much bigger issue is this idea that Hoplites were some awesome battle-winning formation that came to crush all other formations; a myth that originated from Hanson's ""Western Way of War"". Hoplites were in fact rarely used in open battle; as ancient-era warfare was still dominated by sieges. There is no evidence at all to suggest they would have consistently won against non-Hoplite armies; wicker shields or not.

Indeed, most battles that feature Hoplites had Hoplites fighting *on both sides* of the battlefield, so the battle was won based on specific circumstances and leadership rather than because of the superiority of the Hoplite. Meanwhile, the Hoplites lost a *lot* of battles when they faced non-Hoplite armies - most particularly against the Romans who were very familiar with this formation and developed tactics specifically tailored against it.",False,False,False,,,0,1567398426,,1567398655,0,{},eyshjnk,False,t3_cxrz0a,False,False,t1_eynp6m4,/r/WarCollege/comments/cxrz0a/how_effective_were_wicker_shields_in_the_bronze/eyshjnk/,False,,1575956538,13,True,[],False,WarCollege,t5_39t8u,r/WarCollege,public,0,True

A clinical protocol of a multidisciplinary team with mental health professionals, physicians, and surgeons, including puberty suppression, followed by cross-sex hormones and gender reassignment surgery, provides trans youth the opportunity to develop into well-functioning young adults. All showed significant improvement in their psychological health, and they had notably lower rates of internalizing psychopathology than previously reported among trans children living as their natal sex. Well-being was similar to or better than same-age young adults from the general population.

‚Ä¢ The only disorders more common among trans people are those associated with abuse and discrimination - mainly anxiety and depression.

Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Lord Rothschild -1917

The declaration hardly established a Jewish State. It was, however, followed by some colonialism and illegal immigration to Palestine. 

Michael J. Cohen wrote a book called ‚ÄúThe Origins and Evolution of the Arab-Zionist Conflict.‚Äù It discusses how, before the Balfour declaration, anti-Semitic sentiment in post-enlightenment Europe convinced many prominent Jewish thinkers that they would never be able to escape the prejudices of their gentile neighbors. He described the process by which anti-Semitic programs in Eastern Europe forced many Jews to flee to the west. These programs are believed to be one of the catalysts for what is called the Haskalah, or Jewish Enlightenment. The Haskalah split the Jewish people in two, those who believed Judaism was just their religion, and those who believed it was an ethnic identity.

Many anti-Semites seized on this opportunity to portray the Jewish people as ‚Äúother,‚Äù and encouraged the notion that the Jewish people should have their own state in Palestine. 

In, ‚ÄúOne Land, Two States: Israel and Palestine as Parallel States,‚Äù Mark Levine states: ‚ÄúThe parents of Zionism were not Judaism and tradition, but anti-semitism and nationalism.‚Äù Levine goes on to suggest that the Holocaust and several miraculous victories in Palestine over Palestinians served as a motivator for many Jewish people to embrace the nationalist identity of modern zionists (Levine p211), as up until then the movement had failed to catch much wind. 

It wasn‚Äôt until after many conflicts between settlers and the Palestinian people that, in May 14, 1948, The Jewish People‚Äôs Council declared the existence of an independent Jewish State. 

Now, to directly address your comment. I don‚Äôt know if anyone has the right to give anyone a country. Especially at such a cost to another people. The UN, most notably the USA and USSR, did just that. 

I also never made any value judgment about the worthiness of the Jewish people in any society. In fact, I was really just questioning the motives of the Europeans in facilitating and encouraging the Jewish people to leave Europe. I believe that diversity is what makes America strong. 

One final note: I am not a scholar of Jewish history. The above is weak sauce compared to all the great books written on the subject.

I wish Poles dealt with their own war crimes in a similar manner that germans did. We are so good at playing the victim card. It's like a national sport in Poland.

But overall the cost of putting lines underground is very expensive, especially in an area of high population. You have to disrupt current power and then do construction in a timely matter before people/businesses get really cheesed off. Assuming there is space for underground power, most of our construction was built with overhead power lines in mind.  


And with expense, we have to consider who is paying for it. It's not really feasible to have the entire USA pay for underground power for certain states because people will fight against increased taxes to support a totally different state. So then we have to get that money from the state that is making the changes, but can those states really pay for the construction? In the EU one entire country can focus its resources on paying and building the system for the whole country, but in the USA each state would have to pay individually. And since each state's economy varies, not every state would have the money like a single country in EU to put everything underground.   


Also underground power is not completely invulnerable to external forces. Underground power is great against weather such as strong winds and tornadoes.  But when we talk about hurricanes there is a high risk of flooding and underground power, even when properly protected, is still at a risk during floods. As other users have mentioned, the cost of repairing underground lines is expensive.  


So a lot of hurricane prone states have done a cost analysis and figured that repairing overhead lines every storm is cheaper than building and maintaining  underground lines.

1. Age and Gender - 21M

2. Location, and are you willing to relocate for a prospect? - It‚Äôs kinda complicated... California born I have family all over the US though. I‚Äôm in Europe right now too. I‚Äôve been out and about!
3. Marital Status - Single/Divorced/Children: Single. Never been with anyone.

4. Ideal marriage timeline: No preference. Maybe 2 years, but I am willing to adjust to that special someone‚Äôs timeline.

5. Age Range that you would want/require in a prospect: 20+, I have no strict preference other than for maturity. Pretty clich√© lol.

6. Five important characteristics you look for in a prospect:

I just want someone who‚Äôs good! But without making some kind of list of demands here‚Äôs what‚Äôs ‚Äúgood‚Äù to me.

Communicative - I would love to have someone who speaks her mind always
Active - I am an athlete and I would love to have someone has a love for excercise and health like me
Romantic - I love love and have thought of so many ways to treat my future wife. If someone thinks of treating me in that way too, it would make for something beautiful.
Humor - This is clich√©, but I like to make outlandish jokes, and to have someone with a pretty equally wild sense of humor, or can at least entertain it, would be great.
Patience/Understanding - It is super important that we are understanding of each-other. That is what will help us get through anything. I want someone to seek to know how I am and why I am the way I am. And I will do the same.

5. State/specify your level of religiosity: 

Sunni. I am like anyone else! Trying my best to live up to my expectations as a Muslim while also navigating this world as it is. I am not perfect, but the effort is there. I pray, and read Quran and attend the masjid.

6. Level of education, and what are you looking for? 

I am an Undergrad. 

I want an intelligent woman, but not necessarily ‚Äúhighly college educated‚Äù. That being said, my wife can be far more college educated than me, it doesn‚Äôt matter either way.

I would not judge someone for not getting a PhD. There are other ways to make money!

7. Current Job Status

Full-Time Student
Part-Time Barber
Part-Time IT Consultant
Career Path: Lawyer

8. Ethnicity, and are you more open to mixing?

West African, I am open to mixing

9. List 3 hobbies, or things you like to do in your spare time: 

I like writing/performing poetry üìù
I am big on weight training
I love cooking! 
Nature oriented activities like hiking or sailing are awesome
I also have pretty nerdy interests like music, video games, comics/superheroes, anime, etc.

Let‚Äôs geek out over something. What are your interests?

10. Add something short and interesting about you that makes you stand out!

I‚Äôve done some intense things while fasting, I‚Äôve played football games, gone on runs, went through whole training sessions, etc. so I guess I have crazy willpower.

Tuollaista uhkaa ei ole, ellei halua tuhota ymp√§rist√∂√§ tuhoamisen itsens√§ vuoksi.

EU:ssa on ruoasta kaikkialla ylituotanto, koska maataloustukia jaetaan kaikkialla. My√∂s Suomessa on merkitt√§v√§ ylituotanto. Sianlihasta taidetaan vied√§ suuri osa ulos maasta eli hy√∂ty valuu lihayhti√∂ille ja veronmaksajat maksavat tuet, jotka aiheuttavat matalan hinnan.

EU pystyisi varmaankin helposti ruokkimaan ainakin tuplam√§√§r√§n ihmisi√§ jos lihaa vaihdetaan osaksi ekologisiin kasviksiin. Muutama kymmenen miljoonaa suuta menisi pelk√§ll√§ nykyisell√§kin ylituotannolla.

Lis√§ksi l√§nsimaisesta ylituotannosta k√§rsiv√§t my√∂s kehittyv√§t maat ja niiden oma ruokahuolto: L√§nsimaiden ylituotanto myyd√§√§n kehittyviin maihin ja siell√§ maatalouden edellytykset heikentyv√§t, koska l√§nsimaiden dumppaama ylituotantoruoka on halpaa. Kehittym√§t√∂n maatalous altistaa helpommin my√∂s n√§l√§nh√§d√§lle. L√§nsimaiden ylituotanto saattaa olla jopa osasyyn√§ tuleviin ongelmiin.

Ilmastopakolaisista on varmasti kaikenlaista haittaa, mutta ruokaa on varmasti jos ei tee tyhmyyksi√§. Nykyiset peltoalat pystyv√§t ruokkimaan 10-14 miljardia ihmist√§ jos osa lihasta vaihdetaan kasviksiin.

1. Sure the government has tried to carry out Brexit. Labour, the Lib Dems, and the rest of parliament have consistently blocked it. They don't want the deal, they don't want no deal. Perhaps they have no responsibility to the country?

2. &gt;referendum are advisory and elections are legally binding

I'm sure you know that the government offered a referendum on the basis that it was 'once in a lifetime' and that they would abide by the result. People voted on that basis and afterwards even Corbyn and the rest of the house (bar LDs) stated that they would abide by the result. But I guess because its a result you don't like then they don't have to.

3. As you've stated 70% of our food has nothing to do with the EU. The 30% that does is mostly replaceable by things that don't. Even then, your whole argument is based on OUR government applying an import tax. Why should we do that? We don't have a tax at the moment, so you think that the day we leave it becomes what? 20%? That's not how WTO works - we apply the rate to our imports, they apply the rate to our exports. Therefore your predictions on price rises are completely arbitrary. We won't have to check lorry loads of imports since we know the EU regulations stand ie there'll be no change to what we buy from the EU unless we decide to change it.

4. The reason minimum wage hasn't caught up to inflation is exactly why we need to stop FoM. Thanks for making that point for me. Without a regular supply of cheap labour from Eastern Europe, wages will rise to at least match inflation, because British workers demand a living wage and less of the money goes abroad to support families in poorer countries.

5. I think the best thing you said was that during the financial crises the value of the pound dropped 21%. Well guess what? Everyone survived! If that's the level of disaster we face where big business suffers and the normal person simply has to buy British because its too expensive to buy from abroad then fine. Absolutely fine, and good for the local economy.

6. The EU is a machine designed to speed up the transition of money to the top.

But pedantry aside...

It is really difficult to speak about equal rights, because back in the day society wasn't just divided along the lines of sex, but class too. Sure, men in many nations had a bit of an advantage - for example, in certain countries as time progressed, wealthy male non-noble merchants got the vote earlier, but that's just one right of many. The idea of fundamental human rights is a relatively new one, and one that's not completely realised even today, much less 100 years ago. And breaking down equality ot the right to vote is kind of simplistic. 

But let's look at the right to vote. America's an exception, but if you look at European nations - say, the UK. There's a buttload of info about women's suffrage, but men's... not so much. In fact, search for men's rights, and you get women's rights. So no wonder gullible young girls with little understanding of history (especially since it is taught through a feminist lens) get the impression that men always had the right to vote. Or they just never think about it. 

So, when did men get the right to vote in the UK? Well...

In 1866, in order to vote in Britain, you had to be a noble (male of female), or a man of 21 years of age... who owner real estate. Funny how that goes. For reference, this meant 1.4 of the 30 million population. So really, 91% of men still couldn't vote. 

They increased the voting right to 18% of the population by 1884, but that's still based on property. 

And finally, meg got the universal vote in 1918, as a compensation for their service in WW1. This act also gave the vote to women who were over 30, and owner property, or whose husband owner property. That's a pretty big chunk of the female population. 

THen in 1928 women too got the right universally. 

So really the difference between unalienable women's suffrage and men's suffrage was barely 10 years. Doesn't sound like ""centuries of oppression"" to me...

&amp;#x200B;

In the post-colonial era the rise of anti-communism in the west meant that decolonialisation had to be rethought. Each country adopted slightly different approaches, with France generally remaining the most involved with their ex-colonies, hence French troops defending Mali from terrorists.

In the Belgian case, they had no hope of retaining their colonies. /u/AbjectStress has given a pr√©cis of Belgian actions in the Congo. Essentially, rather than retain the whole country - an impossibility - through a puppet regime, events escalated and Belgium pulled out very abruptly, causing chaos.

At the same time, Katanga, a province administered separately with great mineral wealth tried to secede from the Congo with tacit Belgian support. And the CIA tacitly supported the Belgians tacit support.

Katanga retains valuable mineral deposits which were best kept out of communist hands, as far as the West was concerned. The UN were involved in this part of the conflict.

&gt; LONDON - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is laying an election &amp;quot;Elephant trap&amp;quot; for the opposition Labour Party that it should avoid, former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair warned on Monday.

&gt; &amp;quot;Boris Johnson knows that if no-deal Brexit stands on its own as a proposition it might well fail but if he mixes it up with the Corbyn question in a general election he could succeed despite a majority being against a no-deal Brexit because some may fear a Corbyn premiership more,&amp;quot; Blair said.

&gt; Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn &amp;quot;Should see an election before Brexit is decided for the elephant trap it is,&amp;quot; he said.

 Ao fazer um curso para empreendedores, Monica Segre, 60, dona da loja de vinhos Via Vinum, percebeu que poderia negociar e diminuir suas despesas com contador, internet e transporte. 

 J√° o investimento em um software foi o que possibilitou uma economia de 8% no gasto com compras da Sampa Foods, empresa que faz eventos gastron√¥micos e gest√£o de restaurantes em S√£o Paulo e em Foz do Igua√ßu, no Paran√°. 

 ‚ÄúA plataforma nos ajudou a fazer uma compra mais racional‚Äù, diz o diretor da empresa, Leandro Camini, 33.

 Para a corretora digital Monetus, de Belo Horizonte, o que fez diferen√ßa foi sair de um im√≥vel com um aluguel caro para um mais barato, afirma Vin√≠cius Soares, 24, fundador da startup.

 E mudan√ßas no uso de telefonia e energia el√©trica ajudaram a salvar de uma crise a Gigatron Franchising, desenvolvedora de software para varejista, segundo o diretor-executivo da companhia Marcelo Salom√£o, 41.

 A seguir, veja o depoimento dos quatro empres√°rios.

### ‚ÄòAt√© uma caneta jogada fora j√° √© um gasto extra‚Äô

 Monica Segre, dona da loja de vinhos Via Vinum

 Vinho √© uma coisa maluca. Os consumidores sempre pesquisam pre√ßo e escolhem qual v√£o comprar por uma diferen√ßa de um real. 

 Se eu colocar o meu valor mais alto, n√£o vai vender. N√£o importam os meus custos, o pre√ßo tem que ser o mesmo que o dos concorrentes, n√£o adianta. Ent√£o, preciso sempre estar atenta √†s despesas.

 Desde maio, estou fazendo um curso no Sebrae. Depois de assistir √†s aulas de administra√ß√£o financeira, percebi que, al√©m de todo o esfor√ßo que eu j√° fazia para reduzir custos, ainda tinha muito mais que dava para fazer.

 Percebi que mesmo um valor que parece pequeno j√° faz diferen√ßa. Uma caneta jogada fora j√° √© um gasto. Ent√£o, eu comecei a analisar item por item para entender o que poderia ser cortado.

 Fui atr√°s da operadora de telefonia para conseguir um plano mais vantajoso de internet e telefone. Se a gente n√£o negocia, eles d√£o a op√ß√£o que querem. Passei duas horas no telefone e consegui cortar uma taxa de R$ 60.

 No curso, tamb√©m vi que outras empresas pagavam menos para o contador. Negociei com o profissional, que concordou em reduzir o pagamento em 5%. 

 Al√©m disso, revisamos a nossa log√≠stica de ecommerce. Na cidade de S√£o Paulo, trocamos a transportadora (que ainda leva os nossos produtos para o resto do pa√≠s) por uma empresa de entregas via aplicativo. 

 Antes, a gente pagava frete de R$ 28 para qualquer bairro da capital. Agora, o valor varia de R$ 10 a R$ 17 para os lugares mais pr√≥ximos. Como oferecemos entrega gr√°tis nas compras acima de R$ 500 dentro da cidade, isso tem feito diferen√ßa.

 Com todas essas iniciativas, estou conseguindo economizar at√© R$ 3.000 por m√™s. √â um dinheiro que vou poder investir aqui dentro.

 O curso e o contato com outros empres√°rios abriram meus olhos. N√£o d√° para ficarmos fechados no nosso neg√≥cio, temos que sempre circular por a√≠ e trocar ideias.

 ### ‚ÄòA tecnologia ajuda a economizar, mas sozinha n√£o resolve‚Äô

 Leandro Camini, diretor da Sampa Foods

 No nosso restaurante em Foz do Igua√ßu, t√≠nhamos um profissional para fazer as compras. Num deslize dele, descobrimos que desviava produtos. Trocamos por um novo comprador, que, por sua vez, n√£o era t√£o eficiente.

 √â um setor muito complicado. Para fazer boas compras, seria preciso ter uma equipe inteira. Mas um restaurante n√£o tem como pagar por isso.

 Num curso, descobri a CMV, uma plataforma de gest√£o de compras, que faz a cota√ß√£o de todos os insumos com os fornecedores. O gerente e a nutricionista s√≥ colocam a lista de produtos no sistema e fazem o acompanhamento.

 Tamb√©m ficou mais f√°cil controlar o que √© comprado por fora. Antes, tinha essa coisa de ir ao mercadinho pegar algum ingrediente que ficava faltando. Hoje, conseguimos planejar melhor o card√°pio e coibir essa pr√°tica.

 Com isso, conseguimos uma economia de 8% nas compras. Para usar o software, pagamos uma mensalidade de R$ 890 para cada restaurante.

 A tecnologia ajuda a reduzir custos, mas sozinha n√£o resolve nada. Antes [de receber uma plataforma](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mpme/2019/02/softwares-auxiliam-pequenos-empresarios-a-gerir-contas.shtml), √© preciso formatar as opera√ß√µes, se n√£o ela vira s√≥ mais uma burocracia. Se a empresa estiver desorganizada, vai jogar dinheiro fora. 

 ### ‚ÄòUma startup n√£o precisa ter piso de m√°rmore‚Äô

 Vin√≠cius Soares, fundador da Monetus

 Come√ßamos em um escrit√≥rio que divid√≠amos com outros empreendedores, no centro de Belo Horizonte. O valor total do aluguel era R$ 30 mil, n√≥s pag√°vamos R$ 8.000.

 Fomos crescendo no mundo digital. A√≠ percebemos que est√°vamos recebendo cada vez menos visitas de clientes. Ent√£o, decidimos achar uma estrutura mais enxuta. 

 O espa√ßo era t√£o grande que a conta de ar-condicionado do andar inteiro ficava em torno de R$ 5.000. S√≥ a minha empresa pagava cerca de R$ 1.500. 

 Durante um m√™s, pesquisamos lugares na regi√£o central. Se a gente pegasse um im√≥vel mais distante, os funcion√°rios teriam que fazer viagens longas de √¥nibus, o que daria uma grande perda de produtividade, porque as pessoas j√° chegariam cansadas.

 Encontramos um andar com 200 metros quadrados e, depois de negociar com o dono, fechamos um aluguel de R$ 2.500, com um prazo de seis meses para come√ßar a pagar. Isso porque tivemos de fazer uma reforma de R$ 20 mil.

 O espa√ßo √© inferior ao que a gente estava antes, que tinha at√© piso de m√°rmore. Mas [uma startup](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mpme/2019/04/antes-de-montar-startup-e-preciso-identificar-problema-e-testar-ideia.shtml) n√£o precisa disso, pode ter qualquer tipo de piso.

 Para reduzir ainda mais os custos, h√° seis meses, estamos dividindo o escrit√≥rio com outra empresa, que paga metade do aluguel.

 Muitas vezes, partimos do pressuposto de que, para abrir uma empresa, √© preciso ter uma superestrutura. A gente v√™ um monte de startups com mesa de sinuca, piscina de bolinha e escorregador. Mas, quando a gente est√° no come√ßo, o foco n√£o √© esse. Temos que fazer mais com menos.

 ### ‚ÄòConseguimos uma redu√ß√£o de 91% nos gastos de telefonia‚Äô

 Marcelo Salom√£o, diretor-executivo da Gigatron

 Em 2017, tivemos um problema que comprometeu 80% da receita. Para sobreviver, demitimos 150 funcion√°rios. Ficamos com 70.

 Al√©m disso, precisamos cortar todos os tipos de despesas. A redu√ß√£o mais significativa foi nos custos de telefonia. Hav√≠amos feito, em 2016, um investimento em uma central que gravava as liga√ß√µes. Eu gastava at√© R$ 4.000 por m√™s para manter essa estrutura.

 Agora, temos seis celulares pr√©-pagos, que s√£o compartilhados. Descobrimos que n√£o precis√°vamos de tudo aquilo, aplicativos supriram bem nossas necessidades. Por exemplo, compramos por R$ 3,90 uma ferramenta que grava as liga√ß√µes. Assim, conseguimos uma redu√ß√£o de 91% nos gastos de telefonia.

 Al√©m disso, realocamos a equipe dentro do nosso escrit√≥rio, um pr√©dio de 530 metros quadrados em Birigui, no interior de S√£o Paulo. Antes, os funcion√°rios ficavam divididos em seis salas. Reunimos todos em apenas duas, o que gerou uma economia de luz e ar-condicionado.

 Tudo o que fizemos virou h√°bito. Mesmo com a empresa podendo pagar, vamos manter as mudan√ßas. De uns tr√™s meses para c√°, j√° come√ßamos uma retomada de caixa.

After exit, even the opening of any trade negotiation requires unanimity amongst the 27. The preconditions the 27 would set are already obvious and we would during the election campaign have heard repeatedly from the Prime Minister ‚Äì indeed, we already have ‚Äì that he would not accede to any of them. In which case, no trade negotiation will even commence.

This would not be a short-term phenomenon. Businesses would react accordingly. As I say, they have no choice.

On ‚Äòmini deals‚Äô, the reality is, as UK officials have already long experienced, that the legislation the 27 put in place to govern economic relations with the UK after a disorderly exit has not even been up for consultation with us, let alone negotiated.

These are not ‚Äòdeals‚Äô. ‚ÄòDeals‚Äô by definition require negotiation and compromises. These are faits accomplis, set solely in the interests of the 27 by the 27, in both their content and longevity. This is not the UK in any sense ‚Äòtaking back control‚Äô but forfeiting it entirely. Campaign slogans are fine. But they are not a policy.

This EU legislation would not, to be clear, deliver economic armageddon to the UK. It is not in the EU‚Äôs interests to bring all trade to a halt, or make arrangements punitive. We do not, mercifully, live in the era of Napoleonic War blockades. But the arrangements, sector by sector, would fall very far short of what could be achieved even in a modestly ambitious FTA.

And for UK businesses, they will be uncertain, provisional, and open to adverse revision ‚Äì solely by the other side, where the UK is not present. Faced with a more belligerent UK which has chosen to walk, the EU has every interest in keeping the pressure on by making these arrangements asymmetrical and highly suboptimal for UK interests.

And, let‚Äôs be clear: EU regulators across many sectors will press firms after a ‚Äòno deal‚Äô to comply with their requirements about location and ownership. The UK will ‚Äì immediately ‚Äì face tough choices about whether to counter that with reciprocation, which moves us away from a tradition of openness I hope we would maintain, or whether to remain open and risk losing substantially by sticking to our principles.

The EU will assuredly not hold back in a ‚Äòno deal‚Äô scenario, in forcing those issues.

But in doing so, it would of course further exacerbate the increasing tensions in EU-UK relations, and make it more likely that the current breach becomes a permanent rift within the West. Both sides of the Channel are in my view really far too blas√© about that prospect.

The EU is wholly within its rights to defend its interests and the integrity of its legal order. As I say, it cannot be expected to change its principles and club rules for an exiting state. If we actively want to be a fairly distant ‚Äòthird country‚Äô on sovereignty grounds we can scarcely complain that the EU applies to us what it applies to others in the same category.

But the EU‚Äôs relationship with the UK has geostrategic implications. This is no ordinary trade nerd process. And the almost wholly technocratic Article 50 process has led to persistent strategic myopia from the EU, not just confusion and incompetence from the UK.

If the Prime Minister is serious about a post-Brexit vision in which the UK concludes a multiplicity of bilateral free trade deals, both with all major trade  blocs and with emerging markets, he knows as well as anyone that:

All these deals will take some years to negotiate. If they are to have any serious economic value for the UK, they will entail difficult compromises. Trade negotiations are not sentimental seminars full of economic liberals: and that applies just as much, if not more, to negotiations with the US, let alone China and India. No trade deal will ever be agreed by any of those partners, without delivering major economic dividends for them. I favour negotiating such deals post Brexit, but it is already long past time to be honest with the public about the dividends other superpowers will demand are put on the negotiating table.
Much more of our trade is, and will be for the foreseeable future, with our neighbouring bloc ‚Äì notably in services, in which the UK is highly competitive and all cross-border trade liberalisation is immensely difficult, precisely because it inevitably impinges heavily on domestic regulatory sovereignty. We export more services to the EU than to our next eight markets put together, because, for all its many deficiencies, the EU has made more progress in liberalising services trade than any other bloc in the world. Those patterns can, should and will change over time. But not hugely more abruptly than they have while we were in the EU. My experience tells me that the Prime Minister will very soon discover, should he ever manage to start a trade negotiation with the EU, that in practice he wants vastly better market access in the EU on services than Canada (which does a small fraction of our volume of trade with the EU). As with his predecessor, red lines will fade inexorably to pale pink as reality bites. The sooner the public hears some honesty about the trade-offs, the less furious it will be when they emerge.
It consequently makes absolutely no sense whatsoever to have a lattice work of preferential deals which excludes the EU. If we do not want to live with WTO-only commitments with the US, Japan, Canada, Korea and others, that must apply also to the EU.
Any abrupt ‚Äòno deal‚Äô exit would constitute a genuinely major supply shock to the UK, and would oblige us to negotiate post exit from a position in which the negotiating baseline ‚Äì which will be in operation in the real world of commerce ‚Äì will be no preferential deal. The pressure of the ticking clock will therefore be on the UK: precisely the same trap into which Theresa May fell so spectacularly on Article 50. Any government minister who believes the EU would not exploit that leverage to force better terms has clearly not been paying attention for the last three years. Any minister who believes that ‚Äòno deal‚Äô improves the UK‚Äôs negotiating leverage for the next, crucial, phase, does not understand trade negotiations.
The EU knows all of this too. Which is why the briefings that the EU is rattled because it knows it finally faces someone with the cojones to walk away is fine for domestic press consumption but gets more of a shrug outside the UK. Sure: the EU believes the risk of a ‚Äòdisorderly Brexit‚Äô has risen even further in recent weeks. Most see it as a majority chance. Some as a near certainty.

But the mistake I am afraid the Prime Minister is making is to believe that, because they believe that, he is likely to get some materially different and better deal than his predecessor. My instinct is that they conclude from recent events that his primary objective is to win an election by reunifying the right and squeezing the Brexit party.

In which case, delivering a ‚Äòno deal‚Äô Brexit, or committing unequivocally to it in an election manifesto and trying to keep the Remain side of British politics split for that election will be the Prime Minister‚Äôs aim, regardless of the revisions the EU offers him on the Political Declaration or examining the alternative arrangements to the backstop. Indeed anything offered to the Prime Minister would have to be loudly declared insufficient and an indication of EU intransigence, or the strategy does not work. If that is one‚Äôs analysis, then one of course politely expresses enormous interest in urgently seeing new concrete legal ideas in print from the UK, but one does not hold one‚Äôs breath.

That EU politeness is of course being oversold here pre-prorogation as indicating new openness to non-backstop solutions. ‚ÄòDo not damage my hand, just as my tough new approach is making progress‚Äô. It is appreciably more likely that it is a careful blame avoidance strategy from the EU.

Both sides now have just one final chance in the coming weeks to draw back from the brink, and not reconcile themselves to this now being simply a blame, or blame avoidance, game. Seen from my seat it looks most improbable that they will. It will require courage, creativity and compromise. And the political market for those may be exhausted by both sides.

But if we do lurch to ‚Äòno deal‚Äô it will not, I am afraid, be some easy rapid patching up of reasonably amicable relations after an election, and smooth progress towards a fairly ambitious free trading and security relationship.

It will much more likely be a fractious, potentially quite seriously conflicting relationship, in which, for years, not months, the UK lives on much worse trading terms with the EU than most of the developed world. Trading terms which will depend overwhelmingly on decisions taken in rooms where no Brit is present. In which trading tensions will inevitably spill over into other areas of cooperation, of which there ought, at this time, to be legions, because the appetite will wither on both sides. This is bad for all.

Former colleagues on both sides of the Channel talk with some foreboding of a potentially lengthy deep freeze in cross-Channel relations as these tensions mount and the incentives to cooperate diminish.

Some people definitely take it too far, but that's on both sides of the fence. Me personally, I openly talk about my diet and my own views on weight - but mutual respect for someone's choices is important. If they're completely aware of their actions, that will likely have a major impact on them later in life - who am I to say they should be doing otherwise? It *is* their body, shame as it is to see someone less able than others based on their choices - that's when I start to find it absurd, if it's at a point where you can't even go to work, or to the store. Whatever. If you're overweight, but don't let it stop you from doing those everyday things - that's all that matters from a public perspective.

I think high streets should have more plus-size specified stores (At least in Europe). At the moment you have like, Jacamo and...? Some of my friends are diabetic through genes, despite having a healthy diet their whole lives, the diagnosis was inevitable and their weight still suffers from the condition. It's unfair to tie some like that who can't help themselves under the same brush as those who kinda made the problem. Those people actually struggle to find clothes to match their body and I wouldn't even call them obese... more like overweight

I'm not saying we should be accepting to people who take advantage of the system, or act as if they're being oppressed by society as a whole. It's only ever if its at a point where those everyday chores becomes impossible and it becomes beyond a social norm that society has a judgement. I think acceptance for overweight rather than obese would be great, especially for men. Women have a lot of plus-sized models and so on to inspire, whereas there's still a lot of insecurity for men in that shape.

I used to be overweight 10 or so years ago and some assumptions and judgements people give you - which do still exist, are totally uncalled for.

Fact that Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs squad have become self-policing displays their new-found mean streak that echoes back to the glory days of Dalglish and Souness

Sadio Mane was right to get annoyed with Mohamed Salah when the Egyptian did not pass the ball his way in Liverpool‚Äôs 3-0 victory over Burnley on Saturday.

Mane was furious when he was substituted. The Senegalese believed that he could have added a fourth goal if the ball had been laid off in his direction.

Equally, Salah was within his rights to shoot. He has earned the chance to try his luck with his goalscoring exploits ‚Äì 57 in 78 Premier League matches.

Jurgen Klopp will be delighted with Mane‚Äôs reaction. It shows that the team‚Äôs killer instinct is still sharpening. Even the stars of the side are being held to account by their team-mates, a characteristic of the very best Liverpool sides over the years.


When Klopp took over at Anfield there was a feeling that the team were not tough enough. They could be bullied by opponents and took setbacks too easily for their manager‚Äôs liking. Graeme Souness called Arsene Wenger‚Äôs Arsenal ‚Äúa team of son-in-laws,‚Äù suggesting that the squad at the Emirates were too nice. Similar insults could be applied to Liverpool.



Klopp‚Äôs team are no longer a soft touch. They hold each other to account. When a mistake on the field is made, the disapproval of colleagues can be even more cutting than the criticism of a manager. Mane‚Äôs outburst shows that Liverpool have reached the point where the players are self-policing. It is a great place to be.


Salah and Mane have a good friendship. It shows in their interactions on the pitch. That should not stop them pushing each other in private or public.

Sometimes even bad relationships are good for the team. Daniel Sturridge and Luis Suarez did not get on. The rivalry pushed both players to try and outdo the other. The 2013-14 season was the most productive of the Englishman‚Äôs career as he strove to outscore his fellow forward. The uneasy partnership almost fired Liverpool to the title.

Traditionally, players at Anfield were encouraged to let those around them know if they were not maintaining the required standard. Under Bob Paisley and Joe Fagan in the 1980s, the dressing room was controlled by Kenny Dalglish and his fellow Scots Souness and Alan Hansen. Any sign of weakness on the pitch was pounced upon and called out. If things were going wrong no one was immune to criticism. ‚ÄúIf you were tired, not contributing or slacking, they didn‚Äôt want to know you,‚Äù Craig Johnston, the Australian midfielder, said. ‚ÄúThey kept everyone in line. They kept the rest of the team professional. They were savage about getting the job done in the most direct way.‚Äù

They would approve of Mane‚Äôs approach.


Dalglish and Souness were ‚Äì and remain ‚Äì close mates but when Liverpool reached half-time 3-0 down to Coventry City at Highfield Road in December 1983, the bonds of friendship were severely tested.

The dressing room was in uproar with Alan Kennedy, the left back, the main focus for criticism but Souness ‚Äì whose nickname was ‚ÄòChampagne Charlie‚Äô ‚Äì began rowing with Dalglish. ‚ÄúIt went out of control,‚Äù Johnston said. ‚ÄúKenny and Charlie were going for it. It started over something small, like ‚Äòyou didn‚Äôt pass to me, you greedy bastard,‚Äô and blew up. I‚Äôd never seen anything like it before or since. The big beasts went for each other. It was excellent viewing.‚Äù


The spat was quickly forgotten. Liverpool ended up losing 4-0 that day but went on to win the title, the League Cup and the European Cup that season.

Johnston‚Äôs amusement was echoed by Roberto Firmino‚Äôs at Turf Moor. The Brazilian was acting as a peacemaker but it was clear Firmino could see the funny side of the situation. Everyone connected with the team will have a laugh about what happened but no one will want to be on the receiving end of a similar reaction.

Mane's frustration continued as he left the field (Reuters)
Liverpool have developed a mean streak in the past two years. Their response to losing the Champions League final to Real Madrid last year was anger. No one wanted to suffer another defeat like Kiev. They have become more mean-eyed and clinical. One of the signature moments in the semi-final against Barcelona came in the second leg at Anfield. With Liverpool three goals down, Andy Robertson bundled over Lionel Messi and then rubbed the Argentinian‚Äôs head in mockery. Robertson showed absolutely no respect for the world‚Äôs best player and the contemptuous act enlivened the Kop as much as any goal in the 4-0 win.

Klopp‚Äôs team are becoming a different animal. They are up for a scrap ‚Äì even if it is between themselves if someone does not reach the heights that are demanded. No one can complain if Salah shoots but he needs to score. If he misses he cannot moan if Mane ‚Äì or anyone else ‚Äì lets him know he needs to do better.

In their eyes the ""kr ranger"" was suboptimal in the, back then, noble and brawler dominated meta (which was not as dominant in KR and people played more ranger and assassin).

We only got a small overlay between KR ranger popping up and the ""end"" of nobles and brawler dominance, so we will never know what the better comp was. With rangers being untouched they were the build that remained. But to say that KR invented the ranger build is just wrong, it was just way more popular in KR as western top players referred nobles and brawler comps. But itself the KR meta was as stale as the one in the west.

To counter the ""but KR figured out that rangers work in patch X"" - yeah, rangers even got buffed from when it was already successful in the west, so it wasnt too hard to figure out it would be good. Nobles just got overbuffed which made rangers shine less.

The moment some top streamers in a specific region start to play comp X, it will cause a major portion of the region the copy it even though it might not be the most effective one.

The colonies were romanticized. Geologists and cartographers explored what were the unmarked regions on European maps, identifying mountains and rivers, and demarcating boundaries. [Hermann Detzner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Detzner) and one Captain Nugent, R.A., had charge of a joint project to demarcate the British and German frontiers of [Cameroon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameroon), which was published in 1913.[\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_colonial_empire#cite_note-25) Travelers and newspaper reporters brought back stories of black and brown natives serving German managers and settlers. There were also suspicions and reports of colonial malfeasance, corruption and brutality in some protectorates, and [Lutheran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutheranism) and [Roman Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholicism) missionaries dispatched disturbing reports to their mission headquarters in Germany.[\[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_colonial_empire#cite_note-26)

German colonial diplomatic efforts remained commercially inspired, ""the colonial economy was thriving ... and roads, railways, shipping and telegraph communications were up to the minute.""[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_colonial_empire#cite_note-Garfield,_p._83-27) Overhaul of the colonial administrative apparatus thus set the stage for the final and most promising period of German colonialism.[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_colonial_empire#cite_note-Miller,_p._19-28)Bernhard Dernburg‚Äôs declaration that the indigenous population in the protectorates ""was the most important factor in our colonies"" was affirmed by new laws.

Subsequent historians would commend German colonialism in those years as ""an engine of modernization with far-reaching effects for the future.""[\[32\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_colonial_empire#cite_note-32) The native population was forced into unequal treaties by the German colonial governments. This led to the local tribes and natives losing their influence and power and eventually forced some of them to become [slave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery) laborers. Although slavery was partially outlawed in 1905 by Germany, this caused a great deal of resentment and led eventually to revolts by the native population\[[*further explanation needed*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify)\].

First of all, I gotta say Dunkey has to be a bad choice of inspiration for playing ANY anime game. Although the game design oriented points about Xenoblade 2 he brings to the table are all true, he and anime just won't ever click. And of course he makes fun of Sawano's music, he doesn't know just how goofy his music and english lyrics can be ( I mean, we all know the rap in DON'T LOSE YOUR WAAAAAYYYY ). But, god is the music good. I personally love NLA day, but I also love Oblivia day way more than Noctilum ( although I love both ). Black tar grew on me, Wir Fliegen and Don't Worry are good in moderation, Theme X and The Way, and Your Voice are just godlike good.

&amp;#x200B;

The combat has to be the most deeply customizable system there is in a JRPG I played so far. And it isn't complicated in a convoluted way, each piece has its place. Ground combat is great, arts feel stylish and satisfying to use, soul voices are great for many reasons, weapons are cool, skells are cool, overdrive is AWESOME and all of the mechanics blend in together properly. I love how each weapon excels at bringing out various things out of Overdrive: dual guns greatly increase overdrive counter due to primer chaining into zero zero/executioner/violent streak for a crapload of hits, raygun has a lot of debuff arts that help boost TP, longsword is great for so many reasons, photon saber hits really hard and looks really cool doing so, and overall you can really make some wacky builds by focusing on various parameters.

&amp;#x200B;

I also love how, after mastering all classes, you return to your beginnings as your unique class drifter, for those sweet 5 skill slots, because all the skills and weapons are ready for you to use. It kind of sucked how Overdrive, in its natural form, is unusable due to just how fast it runs out, but once you add Overdrive Extend and some Max TP UP augments ( which aren't that hard to get ), things change. A LOT. Grinding for classes wasn't that bad since i used my skell to squash bugs with a level way higher than mine ( around Adder Byroad in Cauldros ), and I managed to max out Galactic Knight, Mastermind and Duelist like that, after organically having finished Full Metal Jaguar, my first class of choice. 

&amp;#x200B;

On the topic of grind, I played my entire game without taking into account Squad missions and Support Missions ( Support, which is DLC that you have access to immediately in the JP release, and only after the final chapter in EU/NA releases ), so I relied on farming the same monster over and over for materials without knowing that squad missions give a shitload of materials instead, or how miranium income by frontiernav is very little, over like 30 minutes. I was getting 37.5k miranium, and when i wanted to augment, i found out it costs 20k per slot, and a weapon can have 3, so i was like what the fuck. I then found out support missions allow you to get like 20k miranium per, or 300k credits per, or a lot of party affinity per(which is really hard to train organically in order to do the affinity missions), or a lot of battle points per(which are a MUCH, MUCH slower process to get via just opening containers which may also be locked behind field skills). If you haven't done so already, my advice is that you enable the pseudo online mod in cemu from your graphics packs and also enable DLC quests, otherwise waiting 30 minutes just to open an augment slot is just ridiculous. Same with leveling arts and skills. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think the grind and progression are great if those support missions are available from the get go, and if i knew about them, it would have made my gameplay even more enjoyable. It's not like it's gamebreaking since the JP version already allows that when you purchase them, and you still need a decent level to even finish the missions and there's different tiers. Like, what's the point in doing the lvl 1 requirement mission for 2 battle points after you finished chapter 12 when you can go straight for the 48 battle points, or even the 60 battle points one. It would've helped so much if i knew of those support missions even before the final battle in chapter 12, because it was HARD and took a lot of planning and synchronization. &gt;!fucking chimeras. Why the fuck don't the skells also respawn when you CAN'T FUCKING SAVE!&lt;

~~speaking of leveling skills, i didn't know you could level skills, like you can level arts, until like chapter 6 fml~~

also trying to open my manual softlocked my game so I had to restart cemu, so the wiki was my only real source of information. rip

&amp;#x200B;

The world is just fucking breathtaking. Every area from primordia all the way to Cauldros looks beautiful, mystical and full of life and character. I shared screenshots to people that never played the game, flying in my skell or just on foot, and it immediately caught their attention. ""what is that game?"", they asked. While XC1 and XC2 have beautiful worlds on their own, XCX just takes the cake. Mira is so, so beautiful. I also disagree with the flight module making exploration meaningless, because some mob placements made it straight up impossible to progress in some cases, like in chapter 5 when I had to use my entire team as diversion to  run away from a highly overleveled Grex that was blocking the bridge completely just to reach the final checkpoint where we find out &gt;!we are mims!&lt;. Or all those fucking camouflaged mobs in Noctilum which I have to admit were AMAZING as a concept and execution, and i was amazed when i experienced them the first few times, but frustrating when i just wanted to do something and BAM, TURTLE. It was also a good lesson for the other places. Ain't gonna trick me now, turtle camouflage! I know you're not just a boulder! ... and sometimes it was just a boulder, damn you.

The story itself being episodic left a lot to be desired, and I mean A LOT. WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT IN CHAPTER 6? A &gt;!TELETHIA!&lt; ?! WHY?! Not explained. Then the silly choice for ma-non voices in the dub, just WHY? Then all those interesting alien races which don't get developed upon... What are the Samaarians?! A user in this post did actually show some super interesting insight on their ships. Why does Tatsu keep making references to ""Hom Hom""(chapter 12), ""Bigger than frontier village big"". Are all of those just so they can pay homage to Xenoblade Chronicles 1, or is it more than that? I'd like to believe the latter. Also fuck the tatsu cooking joke, it was only funny the first 5 times Lin said it. I get that he was introducted in the last minute into the story script, so he couldn't do much, but still. 

On the other hand, the side stories are awesome. You have cute fluff like helping a girl confess to his loved one, helping an inter species marriage come to fruition, and shit all the way on the other side of the spectrum like some girl getting jealous that she wasn't taken away with the rest of her team on that water purification plant just outside the city, which got attacked by aliens and shit went full xenomorph and nearly/everyone died( depending on your choices ), a crazy church woman starting a cult and trying to string the ma-non into it by poisoning them then offering the cure, an anti xeno extremist that detests all the aliens that come to live into NLA and tries to kill them, THAT entire quest chain. Side quest characters that just keep reappearing making them more than just NPCs meant to give you just another side quest, just like xenoblade did in 1 AND in 2.

&amp;#x200B;

And going back to the main story and the world itself, it feels unfinished because IT IS. Apparently a lot of the plot got axed during development because they did not have the time ( and were on a really tight fucking budget ) to go through with it, so it ended up the mess it was. And that's not to say the only things that weren't explained were the main plot or even all of the races, but even the fucking landmarks. WHAT IS OBLIVIA? Why are all the ruins there? What happened there? What the fuck is Sylvalum and that giant fucking sphere in the area? Why does sylvalum look the way it does? What the hell is Cauldros and whose civilizations did those golden clad ruins belong to, before the Ganglion came along? WHAT IS MIRA?! How does it all tie into the vision Takahashi had with Xenogears? What the fuck is that ending?!

&amp;#x200B;

I am not saying that the game's plot is superficial, I am saying BOY DO I WONDER JUST HOW AMAZING THIS GAME WOULD BE IF THEY HAD THE TIME TO PROPERLY WORK ON IT. Even in its unfinished state, this game is SO GOOD.

It's contentious but I don't care, it's an issue I feel strongly about living as a migrant in Britain and interacting with white feminists. 

White feminists who perceive the remnants of the 'patriarchy' in their countries as tantamount to cultures where FGM is still prevalent are offensive to me. There are patriarchal hierarchies are dictating the future of their daughters and women are being  coerced into mass sterilisation and subjugated but they're preoccupied with gamergate and video game characters dressing provocatively. That's just so damned frivolous to me. 

If they're vociferous about women's rights but don't subscribe to intersectional feminism then they're just sententious morons with a Twitter account.  Worst still, if they're completely ignorant to these issues while they're postulating that white women in Europe are still oppressed. 

There's an order of precedence established by intersectional feminists and the appeasement of white feminists vanity isn't at the top. 

They're so fond of the word privilege so I want them to use it, give voices to these  issues. Promulgate Women's rights to reject FGM world wide, campaign for the inclusion of women of colour in institutions where there are only white people. Fight for domestic abuse victims. 

The rebuttals ""but we don't live in a country when FGM happens. I don't work in an industry where I can do that. I protested once"" aren't enough. It's just platitudes.

1. Work on your fundamentals. When you can stroke straight and smooth on a consistent basis, you'll find learning everything else much easier. [This stroke drill](https://youtu.be/qzjousgGLjU?t=1122) will help you get a nice stroke going, and [this drill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=680o8EChP_o) as well as [this drill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCiDMcTxW8A) will help identify errors with your stroke.

As for the fundamentals, I always highly recommend a snooker-type stance - it allows for the highest accuracy and is becoming used in pool more and more due to the influx of European players taking over the scene. Their success and consistency speaks volumes. Highly recommend [Barry Stark](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDQiSi2iaA-FWw1J-cf8c6Q) and [Nic Barrow](https://www.youtube.com/user/nicbarrow) on YouTube for solid tips on the snooker fundamentals.

2) Work on your cue ball direction control. I made a little [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgKD-nqKTlQ&amp;list=PLf8RJ8TBeJ4ZJJ9pxC1fP728lN5vlv0cj) of Dr Dave's videos detailing the 30 degree rule, 90 degree rule and Trisect system - learn to apply all three of these concepts to your game, and you'll be able to accurately predict and control the direction of the cue ball on all shots.

EDIT: Note that these won't be accurate though on an English pool table due to the smaller cue ball size. The 30 degree rule is more like the 45 degree rule, the Trisect system is more like the Bisect system (i.e. the draw angle becomes twice the pot angle rather than triple, see video for context). The 90 degree rule still applies, if the cue ball has stun on contact with the object ball then the balls will separate at 90 degrees, so practice playing stop shots and then you can transfer those skills to taking advantage of the 90 degree rule.

3) Work on your touch/cue ball speed control. There are plenty of general cue ball position drills that allow you to set up and pot balls with an emphasis on practising your cue ball control at short range, as well as learn common shot types and get better at potting the types of shots that come up often. The [line-up drill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iunTXZIWTt0) is one of the best as it allows you to practice basic cue ball control and the feel of potting numerous balls in a row - this drill can be as simple or as complex as Gareth demonstrates, and with solids and stripes you can also pot all the balls in rotation once you get good enough and you can mix up the order of them. Searching ""pool position drill"" on YouTube or Google images will bring up a tonne of layouts you can practice. /u/Pilgore1944 also recently created a site with lots of [these types of drills.](https://cuedrills.com/drills/pool-drills/) Drills where all the balls are put into specific positions are more valuable than simply breaking and trying to run out, as they're repeatable and allow you to learn from your mistakes and play the shots again, learning from your errors quickly and efficiently, working on the types of shots you're not very good at and eliminating weaknesses in the process. Getting good at these types of drills teaches you valuable skills that carry over into match play.

To paraphrase Pilgore on his website, a drill which you can successfully perform more than 5/10x successfully but less than 8/10x successfully, is a good drill for your skill level. So find a drill that you'd find challenging, but doable, and run it 10x. If you can complete it between 5-7x out of 10, then you've established a drill you should practice regularly. Track your progress on this drill each time you practice - your goal should be to run the drill 10x per session, and gradually see your success rate increasing each time. When you can consistently complete the drill more than 8x out of 10, then you can consider that drill mastered and move onto something tougher. You should be performing different types of drills within your sessions, such as stroke drills, short position drills, long position drills, long potting drills, and whatever else you struggle with such as rail potting drills or repeating specific types of shots that you struggle with.

4) Learn positional play tactics that will give you a higher chance of running out based on pure knowledge alone. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2qgu3gzPiE) shows a bunch of principles you should learn that will make you plan your runs differently, giving yourself more margin for error in the way you play a lot of your shots, thus improving your run-out percentage. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92Mx7jmef6I) and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Aaspp7sy8) from Dr Dave also show a bunch of common positional errors that many player make, and how to correct them.

5) Avoid using sidespin as much as possible as it adds extra complications, but learn how to use it so that when you do need to use it, you know how. Dr Dave again has a great [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG29YjLC7aM) on using sidespin. As a general rule, you should be more reluctant to use inside than you should outside, as inside creates much more throw on the object ball than outside does.

&amp;#x200B;

Also a sidenote for tactics as a Blackball player - in Blackball rules it's a foul to pocket your opponent's ball, unless you also pot your own in the same shot (i.e. ""skill shot""). Use this to your advantage, if you don't think you can run the table then play shots in a way that you're just playing them at pocket speed and leaving your balls over pockets to block the pockets. If you can start shifting all your balls over pockets then you're setting yourself up to win.",True,False,False,,,0,1567432727,,1567432974,0,{},eytcies,False,t3_cym8fg,False,True,t3_cym8fg,/r/billiards/comments/cym8fg/general_advice_for_beginners_to_get_better_i_play/eytcies/,False,,1575971238,2,True,[],False,billiards,t5_2r9yh,r/billiards,public,0,

Reddit broke some of the formatting - or maybe my grammar or something? - so no cosmic beings haha, but the corpse medicine part. At least I hope not haha.   
Like, Bloodborne is the mix of real European history - cities, folklores, beliefs and customs. Have a look at any European folklore and you'll find similarities with something in Bloodborne. Corpse medicine was a European custom, spread wide and far, which has been kinda of lost in history. 

What breaks the European pattern is the introduction of Lovecraftian Gods, and his concepts of dreamlands and cosmic beings, more evolved, being monsters incomprehensible to the human mind and how consciousness can awake to different realities. It is just dropped on you, no warning. You awake in a dream. Like, how can you awake to a dream? And that is scary, coz you never truly know wtf is happening... The fear of the unknown.   
I think we don't give them credit enough, hahaha. They condensed 300 years of scary stories into one game, hahaha, I can only say job well done haha. 

The Chalice dungeons, I thought like this, see if makes sense.    
You build the characters, then you need somewhere for them to fight. You not gonna build this huge area that distracts from testing the Characters, can cause weird interactions, etc.  
For now, fine tune how combat goes in a small arena. That arena later gets expanded.  
And, waste not, put in the game, joined by the story. That is how they made Demon souls, if I am not mistaken, a bunch of different parts joined by a minimalistic story.   
See how the chalice dungeons tombs look all very old? That is my clue they were first.   
But really, I don't know, haha.   
About Master Willem, I think he was a placeholder boss until they developed Rom, a mini-boss like you said. Like, how there is always a boss at the end of the area. Then changed to a fetch quest. Then changed to nothing. Shows how Master Willem became obsolete, which is also his story! Not credit enough, haha

The trap door, yes, like, if gets you right where Patches is, means the Nightmare Frontier is under the Tomb of the Gods. Or where the lake should be. And that explains why the Amygdalas, in Yahar'gul. That was The School of Mensis God. That they found in Byrgenwerth.   
And even though they are crazy, their notes tell major plot points:

*""The nameless moon presence beckoned by Laurence and his associates. Paleblood.*""  
Who do you seek? Paleblood.   
If you get it, what happens? Ascension.   
How do you get it? The other notes in the Lecture Building:  
*""Three third cords*."" and ""*Hunt the Great Ones, Hunt the Great Ones.""*

[],,fluxdrip,1145541172.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_4par,False,False,[],"There are plenty of very large businesses serving the US or Europe based in other parts of the world. It's certainly possible to have a very successful company with great financial success while starting a distance from your primary market. Many pharmaceutical companies serve the US from elsewhere - Novartis and Roche are based in Switzerland (not a large domestic pharma market), and many Indian pharma companies primarily market drugs in the US. Amazon's second largest global market is Germany and they're headquartered in Seattle. Spotify was started in Sweden and served primarily the US market. Skype was started in Estonia. 

If your customers are in the US or EU, you will likely eventually have some nexus there - employees, offices, marketers, distribution people, regional heads, etc. Amazon has large offices in Germany, Spotify has large offices in the US. And it will definitely be much harder to know your customers initially if you don't have direct daily contact with them - so it's worth figuring out a model that gives you interaction with them even if you won't be physically proximate. If your answer is ""I think I know my customers well already and don't need to get to know them better,"" it seems to me you'll likely fail.

The bigger issue I'd raise with your question is this: starting a billion dollar company is very hard. It's an admirable dream and I'm not here to tell you don't go for it, but you know you are fighting against the odds and you are intentionally further stacking the deck against yourself by setting up remotely when many of your competitors will be local. That's fine, but **in general you don't get to that level of success by articulating all of the things you won't do** (e.g. only ""limited business travel""). There may be periods of your growth when you need to travel a TON, when you need to live remotely for weeks, when you need to effectively work night shifts to be awake during critical business hours. 

Finally one note: many people in this thread are referring you to examples of companies with ""remote working"" cultures. That strikes me as an entirely different question. You can have your entire team right next to you, or you can have a large in-person team in the US and a large in-person team in your country.

it's also good to know that almost every team produces content, for example, on YouTube. if the personalities matter to you and you're interested in more than gameplay, there's a lot of stuff to see! 


G2: the current MSI champions. many would say that becoming a fan of them at this moment of time would be just joining the bandwagon, but i beg to differ! they just might be the best Europe has to offer right now and they could be real contenders for Worlds. the guys are also all big personalities and just overall fun and they dance the line of being too cocky and being simply confident. they also tend to try out new things (they're not the only ones to do this, but i'd say they do it more often) so if you get bored of the meta at times, G2 is the team to watch! you can also root for them if you like to watch your team win.


Fnatic: one of the deeper rooted and most successful organizations of the region! they finished second in the regular split and seem to be the only ones who can match G2. they have strong fundamentals, however, sometimes struggle with inconsistency. i'd say they also have a good mix of personalities which balances the team dynamics. if you are drawn to teams with big history Fnatic is definitely for you.


Splyce: oh, Splyce. they had so much potential. just kidding, they still do. despite having a disaster of a run in the playoffs, people seem to be disregarding them too soon. they might be more predictable than most teams but them doing what they are the best at also makes them more consistent. if you like a slower type of gameplay that resembles the one present in Korea, Splyce is the team to watch!


Schalke 04: they're kinda weird - they don't have that many qualities that make them stand out, yet they still remain above the middle of the pack. a collection of very experienced players overall that either want to repeat their glory days or reach new highs. if you wanna witness what a mix of experience and potential can do, Schalke can do it for you!


Rogue: the underdogs this split! somehow they defied everyone's expectations and made playoffs and then beat Splyce. it's a rookie squad lead by their veteran support (picture ducks) and they continue to impress with their development. there is a lot of, let's say, polish energy in this team which makes sense since there are 3.5 poles in the current roster. if you like underdogs, teams that can surprise you and young talent, don't look further - you've found them!


Vitality: Vitality is the friend that you see struggling with the simplest things like opening a pack of chips or walking without tripping on a smooth surface, yet also somehow managing to pass an exam in physics without revising. shortly, they're kind of a mess. i think Vitality have high highs when they're doing well and low lows the rest of the time. if you're into coinflip teams, Vitality is the one!


SK Gaming: it's hard to make a case for them (because i just haven't paid attention) but i guess the fact that they went on an insane losing streak and still managed to almost get into playoffs (it took a tiebreaker to decide) tells a bit about the team and their mentality.


Misfits: they used to have a roster of big names and so much potential, yet it failed. in the middle of the season all these big stars got replaced by an all-rookie team. and they actually did better than the previous squad. if you want to see a team that doesn't give up on their own style (for better and worse) and can occasionally take down big teams despite being so new to LEC, Misfits might be just for you!


Origen: they fell down from the place reserved for the top teams in LEC. i'm not gonna lie - they just keep disappointing. i wonder whether being an Origen fan requires masochistic traits. for real, though, despite having a disaster of a split they still have a chance at qualifying for Worlds. if you are in for a possibly painful ride and want to see a potential redemption story where one of the past greats rise to the top once again, Origen might be that team.

&gt; Poland invaded Russia during their civil war

Not really, Russians signed secret protocols with german staff that said they would directly control area of Ober-Ost, in which there were lands Poland had legitimate claims to plus polish-speaking population (such as ~~Wilno~~ Vilnius). As Bolsheviks took said city from Germans it was basically a start of war. Soviet government also created (with the help of polish communists)  polish version of Riewwojensowiet, which would be a basis for future soviet government.

&gt; The places they invaded where of Belorussian and Ukrainian nationality. 

Looking at creation of states east of German nad Austrian border after IWW the same way as at the creation of western states is not really a good idea. Eastern and Southern Europe was a cesspool of nationalities and regionalisms (correct me if i used wrong term). Before XX century you weren‚Äôt Polish, Belorussian, or Ukrainian, you were a local. Also after Germany and Austria were defeated and Russian Empire collapsed there was a power void in the region. There was no independent regional government for at least 100 years. Should old pre-partition borders be reinstated or should there be new local governments?

To show how much of a chaos it really was, look at this [map](https://images.app.goo.gl/J6USW5WaURZE2jNv7) of spoken languages based on polish census of ‚Äò31.
There are also stories of families in which one part claimed to be one nationality while the other claimed otherwise. Sheptytsky brothers could be an example, where one of them, Andrey, was one of the most influential figures in Ukrainian church, while his brother, Stanis≈Çaw, was a polish general, who once even joined National Democracy, party which wanted to polonise all other nationalities in polish state.

Also you do realise that during Polish-Soviet war ukrainian government alligned itself with polish government (Pi≈Çsudski had a vision of Intermarum - Alliance or even federation of all the nations between Germany and Russia), right? They at first fought with Poles but since they had the same enemy plus Pi≈Çsudski promised them cooperation after war (he fucked up tho, since after war there was no ukrainian government) they ceased fire and started to fight alongside Poland.

&gt;Check google maps yourself, Ukraine and Belarus still have the territories.

Comparing Interwar situation, in which even families were divided in terms of nationalities to post-war borders where Stalin brutally but effectively cleaned up the borders doesn‚Äôt make a sense at all.



EDIT: Also, i completely forgot about it, but if you look at the map i linked, you can see that in Poleskie voivodeship majority of the pie chart is coloured grey, named ‚Äúinny‚Äù which translates into ‚Äúother (language)‚Äù.

Take a breath and relax, it's supposed to be exciting!

First, I'd say you should forget about buying a house, that's ridiculous. It just makes everything much riskier. Go to Denmark once or before you found a job, rent a place and see how you like it. Don't commit to a house and a place in a country that you actually do not know.

For your family, I can't really help you. The fact you are worried about it makes me think that you fear their reaction. My family was always fine with me moving. You should inform them and share your plan with them. If they are unhappy with it, keep telling them about ot, but remember that's their problem.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I know nurses can find jobs quickly everywhere and I got told that in Denmark they need qualified personnel

Why would a Danish hospital employ someone who does not speak the language? You have to be realistic about it. Does your current workplace employ people who do not speak German?

Focus on jobs. Go where you can get a job. Can you work in English? in German?

Start applying now, chat with a recruiter, update your Linkedin (if you use it), try to reach out to other German people in your case, or other immigrants in Denmark.

Moving abroad is fine, within Europe it's relatively easy but still a big change. You'll be fine, go for it.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;We're scared what happens if we want to come back

What are you scared of? Think about the worst-case scenario. Is it that bad? You come back to Germany, rent a new place and get a new job back where you were, it's okay.

Look I moved from France to the UK as a student (easy), and then from the UK to Spain as a professional with a few years of experience, with my partner from the UK. It's fine. We got a job, a flat, the paperwork done. It's fine. We knew Spanish beforehand but there are people in my company who do not even speak it.

The ""shit show"" isn't a reference to the close vote (though the amazingly poor handling of the referendum itself certainly *could* be termed that).

The ""shit show"" is a reference to the completely bungled handling of the brexit implementation, and the clear dereliction of duty by the government, as they dance jigs on the lawn while ignoring both parliament and the critical impending danger to the UK (which may well not only destroy the country economically, but result in the breakup of the union).

If they had negotiated a smooth exit and come up with solid and workable plans to deal with the problems brexit is going to cause, then people might still not *want* to leave the EU, but they wouldn't be calling it a ""shit show.""

&gt; Ireland has said it cannot agree to Boris Johnson&amp;#039;s demands just for his &amp;quot;Political convenience&amp;quot;, giving the lie to fresh claims that the EU was about to compromise on the Irish border backstop.

&gt; &amp;quot;I think it is worthwhile to point out that there remain many misrepresentations about the solution we have found to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. The backstop is all about managing the unique risks that Brexit creates in Northern Ireland, a fact that prime minister Boris Johnson recognises,&amp;quot; said Barnier.

&gt; The Brexit negotiator said after &amp;quot;Intense&amp;quot; negotiations with EU leaders over the threat an open border in Ireland posed to the security of the single market, &amp;quot;The backstop is the maximum amount of flexibility that the EU can offer to a non-member state.""

With all the tact of a diplomat in a foreign capital, the Spanish ambassador tells the assembled leaders that his government has been following the difficulties faced by the Empire with increasing worry. He underlines the fact that their two governments have been very different in terms of political philosophy. However, Spain remembers that it was Austria at the forefront of the Coalitions against Napoleon, who caused ruin and destruction to the Spanish Empire. Spain recognizes the value of a strong, stable Austrian Empire, as a check to any potential French aggression towards Spain.

The Spanish government is currently undertaking military actions against the kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia. Our impetus for doing so is singular - during the peace negotiations of the Carlist War, several rebel generals admitted receiving weapons, money, and military trainers from Piedmont. We could not allow this brash meddling to go unpunished. Spain has consistently urged Sicily, linked to our Royal Family by marriage, against making war with the Papal States or Austrian Empire. That position has remained constant.

The Spanish government is sensitive to the dangers of nationalism in Europe, as Spain has significant Basque and Catalan minorities who may be emboldened by the success of rebels in Eastern Europe. Spain has followed a policy of limited self-government for its minority groups, which the ambassador humbly suggests the Austrians may wish to try. 

Limited language rights in education and local government, combined with minor taxation rights in certain areas, has done wonders for pacifying Spain‚Äôs minority peoples in the last 10 years. The Basques, formerly the Carlists‚Äô main source of support, were happy to lay down their weapons and live in peace under Madrid‚Äôs rule in exchange for minor concessions. The Spanish ambassador suggests that the Empire offer a similar policy to the Hungarians, in exchange for their renewed fealty to the Empire. Such a move carries risks, but it may be necessary to preserve Europe‚Äôs balance of power.

NATO was not obligated to intervene but it did anyway. NATO carried out a bombing campaign during the Bosnian War that directly led to the end the conflict by forcing the Serbs to the table.

* Albanian Civil War

Albania was not a NATO member until after the conflict and it was a civil war so it was not a NATO problem.

* Kosovo

Resolved at the same time as the Bosnian War with NATO intervention.

* The Troubles

A U.K. (Northern Irish) civil war. Not a war between states so not a  NATO problem.

* Basque Conflict

A Spanish civil war. Not a war between states so not a  NATO problem.

* The Ukrainian Civil War

Ukraine is not a NATO member (Russia intervened specifically because it was worried about Ukraine going pro-EU and becoming NATO member) so NATO had no obligation to intervene.

* Russian invasion of Georgia/South Ossetia

Georgia  is not a NATO member so NATO had no obligation to intervene.

* Russian annexation of Crimea

Part of the Ukrainian conflict.

NATO is a defense pact. It's set up to prevent other states from attacking NATO states. NATO forces help train each other, share capabilities/intelligence, engage persistent threats like cyber attacks and terrorism, and other long term defensive operations/preparations.

The only time Article 5 (obligating states  to come to the defense of an attacked NATO member) was triggered was 9/11 leading to NATO assisting the U.S. in Afghanistan. NATO has engaged in anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden. NATO intervened in Libya in a rare offensive operation but the results of that were questionable.

In Spain we have two tipes of university degrees: official and ""university's own / non-official"" (""t√≠tulos propios""). Official bachelor's degrees are highly regulated, follow the Bologna guidelines, are valid everywhere in the EU and allow you to later pursue graduate studies. Official master's degrees are similarly regulated and allow you to later pursue a PhD. 

Spanish universities usually also offer non-official master's degrees and non-official learning, but, although they do teach you stuff and can sometimes be really specialized, they are not automatically recognized by governments, other universities and other countries. There are non-official master's degrees in statistics, teacher training courses, etc. Their entry requirements are oiften more lax and their validity depends on public perception of the issuing university; employers might value your non-official master's degree if it's been completed in a very well-regarded university, but it might be worth nothing much if it's been issued by some unknown university.

If you have an official degree or master's from a Spanish university, it's valid in Spain, it's valid in the EU and it can be apostilled for validity in other countries. But only accredited/official universities can issue official degrees, and only the issuing university can apostille your degree.

Aos 22 anos, ele estava do lado de fora de um pub em Londres, no Reino Unido, quando um motorista b√™bado atropelou um grupo de amigos seus, matando dois deles.

Alguns meses depois, a meia-irm√£ dele morreu em um acidente de bicicleta e, na sequ√™ncia, uma ex-namorada n√£o resistiu a uma cirurgia.

Andy estava estudando ci√™ncias do esporte na √©poca, mas em meio ao luto, decidiu abandonar a faculdade. E, em busca de uma mudan√ßa completa de vida, resolveu viajar para o Himalaia e virar monge budista.

Ele acabou vivendo os 10 anos seguintes como monge, o que o levou a percorrer toda a √Åsia, e a meditar at√© 16 horas por dia. Ele diz que a medita√ß√£o o ajudou a aceitar tudo.

   Direito de imagem Andy Puddicombe   Image caption  Andy viveu 10 anos como monge   ""Me deu uma mudan√ßa de perspectiva, me ensinou a focar menos em mim e, em vez disso, levar mais felicidade aos outros"", diz Andy, agora com 46 anos.

Amigos e parentes ficaram, no entanto, um pouco chocados e preocupados. 

""Nenhum deles sabia realmente o que fazer. Mas, apesar disso, foram incrivelmente solid√°rios e encorajadores.""

Em 2005, Andy voltou ao Reino Unido para abrir um neg√≥cio de medita√ß√£o, que na √©poca ainda n√£o era uma pr√°tica amplamente difundida no pa√≠s.

""Algumas pessoas ficavam desanimadas com a linguagem por tr√°s da medita√ß√£o, ou viam (a pr√°tica) como algo meio hippie"", diz. 

""Era bastante inacess√≠vel. Ningu√©m tinha paci√™ncia para isso ou n√£o sabiam como fazer.""

**Clientes com ****burn out**

Andy abriu ent√£o seu pr√≥prio consult√≥rio particular em Londres, onde ensinava profissionais que sofrem de burn out (esgotamento nervoso) a usar a medita√ß√£o como uma ferramenta de suporte na vida cotidiana.

Convidados de um epis√≥dio recente da s√©rie semanal da BBC ""The Boss"", sobre diferentes l√≠deres empresariais ao redor do mundo, ele e Richard Pierson administram o popular aplicativo de medita√ß√£o Headspace ‚Äì que j√° foi baixado mais de 16 milh√µes de vezes em todo o mundo e tem uma receita anual estimada em mais de US$ 100 milh√µes (cerca de R$ 413,7 milh√µes).

Em 2005, Richard foi um dos profissionais esgotados que se consultaram com Andy. Depois da universidade, ele come√ßou a trabalhar no setor de publicidade em Londres. Subiu rapidamente na carreira, mas pagou um pre√ßo alto.

   Direito de imagem Headspace   Image caption  Com sede em Los Angeles, Headspace tem hoje 300 funcion√°rios   ""Quando conheci Andy, estava muito desesperado"", diz Richard, hoje com 38 anos.

""Tinha uma fobia social cont√≠nua, e isso era muito desafiador. N√£o tinha um grupo de amigos com quem pudesse me abrir sobre essas press√µes.""

""Ap√≥s a primeira sess√£o, ele mostrou quantos pensamentos eu tinha na minha mente e qu√£o man√≠aca era minha vida. Me empolguei ao perceber que havia uma sa√≠da.""

Uma vez que Richard percebeu o quanto se beneficiava da medita√ß√£o, decidiu que queria abrir um neg√≥cio com Andy, para ajudar a difundir a pr√°tica.

""Foi uma troca de habilidades"", avalia Richard. 

""Ele me ensinou medita√ß√£o, e eu tive v√°rias ideias sobre como dar mais visibilidade (√† pr√°tica).""

De Londres a Los Angeles
------------------------

Em 2010, eles promoviam eventos em todo o Reino Unido, onde conversavam sobre os benef√≠cios da pr√°tica e realizavam sess√µes de medita√ß√£o em grupo.

Com esse dinheiro e com a ajuda de amigos, criaram naquele ano a primeira vers√£o do aplicativo Headspace, em que os usu√°rios podem escolher v√°rias medita√ß√µes guiadas de 10 minutos.

   Direito de imagem Headspace   Image caption  O aplicativo Headspace conta com milh√µes de usu√°rios   Para a sorte deles, o jornal brit√¢nico The Guardian incluiu um encarte do Headspace em todos os jornais num s√°bado, enquanto a companhia a√©rea Virgin Atlantic incorporou conte√∫do de medita√ß√£o personalizado do Headspace ao sistema de entretenimento de suas aeronaves. Isso levou a um n√∫mero cada vez maior de pessoas a baixar o aplicativo, que hoje custa 9,99 libras (R$ 50) por m√™s.

Andy, que √© a voz do aplicativo, diz: ""No in√≠cio, √©ramos s√≥ n√≥s dois, ningu√©m nos dava mais dinheiro, ent√£o ped√≠amos favores a todos os nossos amigos"".

""Um dos nossos amigos nos ofereceu um est√∫dio de grava√ß√£o, e outro, um escrit√≥rio de gra√ßa. Algumas pessoas realmente acreditaram no que est√°vamos fazendo e aceitaram receber um sal√°rio menor para vir trabalhar conosco. Somos muito gratos por isso agora.""

Em 2013, Richard e Andy decidiram mudar a empresa de Londres para Los Angeles, onde fica a sede do Headspace desde ent√£o.

""N√£o √© que a gente n√£o ame Londres"", explica Andy. ""Mas n√≥s dois sonh√°vamos em morar na Calif√≥rnia e ter um estilo de vida mais ao ar livre. Gostamos de surfar e fazer caminhadas, e isso tamb√©m era conveniente para nossas fam√≠lias"".

Grande parte autofinanciado desde o in√≠cio, o Headspace come√ßou a contar com financiamentos a partir de 2014, com o objetivo de expandir o aplicativo e os neg√≥cios. De l√° para c√°, conseguiram mais de US$ 75 milh√µes em financiamento externo, mas ainda assim, Andy e Richard t√™m participa√ß√£o majorit√°ria.

   Direito de imagem Headspace   Image caption  Richard Pierson √© agora diretor-executivo, enquanto Andy mant√©m o t√≠tulo de cofundador   Considerando que, a princ√≠pio, ambos estavam envolvidos em tudo, quando a empresa come√ßou a crescer, assumiram pap√©is diferentes. 

Richard se tornou executivo-chefe, focando na administra√ß√£o e funcionamento geral de toda a companhia e seus 300 funcion√°rios.

A principal fun√ß√£o de Andy, por sua vez, √© se dedicar √† expans√£o do aplicativo e ser a voz que guia a medita√ß√£o. Ser√° que algu√©m j√° reconheceu a voz dele por a√≠?

""As pessoas normalmente reconhecem minha voz no aeroporto ou no restaurante"", diz ele. ""Minha dentista n√£o se deu conta at√© outro dia. S√≥ quando come√ßamos a conversar sobre medita√ß√£o, e percebi que ela usava Headspace, que consegui ver nos olhos dela que a ficha tinha ca√≠do"".

    Neil Seligman, autor de livros sobre medita√ß√£o, diz que o Headspace ""liderou a revolu√ß√£o mindfulness (aten√ß√£o plena) no espa√ßo digital"".

""A genialidade do Headspace foi pegar algo t√£o dif√≠cil e cheio de nuances, como ensinar medita√ß√£o mindfulness, e diluir em pequenos v√≠deos, √°udios e pr√°ticas palat√°veis"", acrescenta. ""Foi assim que transformaram a ind√∫stria e entraram no mercado global.""

Mas o Headspace n√£o √© apenas um aplicativo. A empresa possui mais de 300 clientes comerciais, como Google, Linkedin, General Electric e Unilever, e ajuda gerentes e funcion√°rios destas companhias a meditar.

Tamb√©m trabalha em parceria com universidades dos EUA, incluindo Harvard e Stanford, e o servi√ßo p√∫blico de sa√∫de do Reino Unido (NHS, na sigla em ingl√™s), em estudos sobre os benef√≠cios da medita√ß√£o para a sa√∫de.

Andy medita todos os dias at√© hoje, embora menos do que as 16 horas de antigamente. Richard tamb√©m arruma tempo para isso.

""N√≥s dois praticamos medita√ß√£o todos os dias"", diz Richard. 

""Realmente acreditamos nisso, √© achamos importante que a equipe e qualquer pessoa que baixe o aplicativo saiba disso.""

I think one factor is that we have the Holocaust, and general World War II, as a clear example of why Fascism is bad and should be avoided.

Meanwhile, a lot of the worst horrors and failures of socialism and communism has happened in the non western world.  Therefore, it tends to get less attention in traditional classrooms and media.  

I think that is maybe why you see bad leaders always being compared to Hitler rather than Mao or Pol Pot or Stalin etc.

You say that measles stopped being fatal in industrialised nations before a vaccine was created for it?

Lets see about that --

[Enders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Franklin_Enders) was able to use the cultivated virus to develop a measles vaccine in 1963 based on the material isolated by Peebles.

The measles vaccine was developed in 1963.

The first measles vaccines were licensed between 1963 and 1965, but it was the first national measles eradication campaign in 1966 that got people vaccinated and measles rates down.

In 1970, there were only 47,351 cases and 89 deaths.  (1970 happened after 1963, just so you know.)

Rates continued to drop until the large outbreaks between 1989 to 1991 (also after 1963), when there were 55,622 cases and 123 deaths. The addition of a measles booster shot got measles outbreaks under control again. By 2000 (also after 1963), when measles was declared eliminated in the United States, there were just 86 cases and one death. 


More recently, measles cases and measles deaths in the United States include:

    2000 ‚Äì 86 cases ‚Äì 1 measles death (infant)  ‚Äì endemic spread of measles eliminated in U.S.
    2001 ‚Äì 116 cases ‚Äì 1 measles death
    2002 ‚Äì 44 cases
    2003 ‚Äì 55 cases ‚Äì 1 measles death (1 year old)
    2004 ‚Äì 37 cases ‚Äì record low number of measles cases
    2005 ‚Äì 66 cases ‚Äì 1 measles death (1 year old)
    2006 ‚Äì 55 cases
    2007 ‚Äì 43 cases
    2008 ‚Äì 140 cases
    2009 ‚Äì 71 cases ‚Äì 2 measles deaths
    2010 ‚Äì 63 cases ‚Äì 2 measles deaths
    2011 ‚Äì 220 cases
    2012 ‚Äì 55 cases ‚Äì 2 measles deaths
    2013 ‚Äì 187 cases (large outbreak in New York City ‚Äì 58 cases)
    2014 ‚Äì 667 cases (the worst year for measles since 1994, including the largest single outbreak since the endemic spread of measles was eliminated ‚Äì 377 cases in Ohio)
    2015 ‚Äì 188 cases ‚Äì got off to a strong start with a big outbreak in California ‚Äì 1 measles death
    2016 ‚Äì 86 cases
    2017 ‚Äì 120 cases
    2018 ‚Äì 372

(All of these years happened after 1963 -- just to keep the facts clear)

So that‚Äôs 11 measles deaths since 2000 and at least 8 measles deaths since 2005. Those years *also* happened after 1963.


Lately, in addition to deaths from acute measles infections, there have been even more deaths from subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE).

About 6 to 8 years after having measles, children with SSPE develop progressive neurological symptoms, including memory loss, behavior changes, uncontrollable movements, and even seizures. As symptoms progress, they may become blind, develop stiff muscles, become unable to walk, and eventually deteriorate to a persistent vegetative state.

Children with SSPE usually die within 1 to 3 years of first developing symptoms, including in the United States:

    2000 ‚Äì 5 SSPE deaths
    2001 ‚Äì 2 SSPE deaths
    2002 ‚Äì 5 SSPE deaths
    2003 ‚Äì 0
    2004 ‚Äì 1 SSPE death
    2005 ‚Äì 2 SSPE deaths
    2006 ‚Äì 3 SSPE deaths
    2007 ‚Äì 3 SSPE deaths
    2008 ‚Äì 3 SSPE deaths
    2009 ‚Äì 2 SSPE deaths
    2010 ‚Äì 0
    2011 ‚Äì 4 SSPE deaths
    2012 ‚Äì 1 SSPE death
    2013 ‚Äì 1 SSPE death
    2014 ‚Äì 0
    2015 ‚Äì 1 SSPE death
    2016 ‚Äì 0
    2017 ‚Äì 0

That‚Äôs 33 SSPE deaths since 2000 and at least 20 SSPE deaths since 2005. Why so many? Many of them can likely be attributed to the large number of cases associated with measles outbreaks from 1989 to 1991.  All of those years are after 1963, when vaccines were developed.


It sounds to me as though your statement
&gt;""Take measles for example. It's a disease that had stopped being fatal in industrialized nations before a vaccine was created for it. When I was a kid it was just another childhood illness no one really thought much about, but you wouldn't know it from all the fear mongering going on in the media.

is untrue.  It was fatal pre-vaccine.  It was fatal post-vaccine. You might have *felt* that it was less virulent, dangerous, or caused no deaths, but that is untrue.  It definitely *was not* 'just another childhood illness no one really thought much about'. I was alive in the early sixties and it absolutely was not characterised as you say.



January 16, 2015 Dr. Bob Sears writes some disinformation which sounds very similar to what you have said:
&gt;Potentially fatal? Technically true, but herein lies the lie. It's been publicized as ""the deadliest of all childhood fever/rash illness with a high rate of complications."" Deadly? Not in the U.S., or any other developed country with a well-nourished population. The risk of fatality here isn't zero, but it's as close to zero as you can get without actually being zero. It's 1 in many thousands. Will someone pass away in the U.S. from measles one of these years? Tragically yes. That will likely happen to one person. *It hasn't happened here in at least ten years (or more - I don't even know how many years we have to go back to find one).* When that happens, it will be extremely tragic.

Here Dr. Bob Sears shows an example of what we call a 'lie'.  There were 11 deaths since 2000 attributable to measles.  That's not zero. That's not non-fatal, and that's not even counting Europe.

If we draw a continuous line around a US, Europe, and a bunch of other countries, we will get a region that emits more than China. Furthermore, if this region contains mainly developed countries, the emissions per capita will also be higher than China.

Should this developed region reduce emissions before China? Suppose a social planner is not racist and believes in utility aggregation. Then, with a relatively small cost of carbon, they will only cut emissions in this region; as the cost of carbon goes up, they would start cutting carbon consumption across the board.

This led to the Jewish Diaspora, in which Jewish peoples were scattered into Europe and the Middle East and didn't really have a home country of their own; they were largely seen as outsiders wherever they immigrated. 

In the late 1800s, a movement called Zionism was started which supported returning the place now called Palestine, inhabited by Arab Muslims for ~1200 years now, back to Israel which would serve as a Jewish homeland. Zionism garnered middling support until after WWII ended and the atrocities of the Holocaust were fully revealed to world. In 1947, the UN basically declared that the region would be divided into a place for Jews (Israel) and a place for Palestinians (the Gaza Strip and West Bank), as well as having the city of Jerusalem be internationalized and not governed by either Israel or Palestine. The next year, the Israelis rolled in and declared Israel an independent country, leading to a war with Palestine, ending with most Palestinians forced out of (what is now) Israel and into (what is now) the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. 

There's been a lot of war ever since between Israel and Palestine as well as neighboring Arabic countries like Lebanon, Egypt, and Jordan, whose territories Israel has encroached into (like the Sinai peninsula in Egypt). The enemies of Israel took the stance of ""You can't just roll in, occupy the area, and kick the Arabs out just because your ancestors used to live here over a millennium ago,"" and the Israelis being like, ""This is our historical homeland, it rightfully belongs to us."" Since then, Israel has been encroaching into Arab territories in the West Bank and elsewhere, against international agreement, and this is made more complicated by Hamas, a (many would call terrorist) organization that continues to wage war on Israel, oftentimes targeting and killing civilians. 

Supporters for Israel advocate for the state's right to exist (specifically there), and detractors of Israel advocate for Israel leaving their neighbors alone and stop treating Palestinians like second-class citizens. The more extreme opponents want Israel gone from the area entirely. Also, the United States funds most of their military and gives them a lot of armaments because the US likes having a strong military ally in the region, but also because Israel would probably get slaughtered if they didn't have a strong military.

And the one who wrote that would also do well to follow his/her own advice with ""Do some research before you get upset"". Statements like that are pretty rich when you don't even notice the difference between ethnic religions and missionary religions.

Judaism is very much an ethnic religion, and while there's definitely been a lot more mixing between Jews and non-Jews throughout history than Halakha allows, _most_ Jewish groups out there still share several distinct genetic markers that link them to eachother and to the Levant.

S/he also says that ""the vast majority of the Jewish people are pure white"". But that's only really true for Ashkenazi Jews (who are, coincidentally, the overwhelming majority of Jews in the Anglosphere). Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews are every bit as 'brown' as your average Middle-Easterner.

A disproportionately large share of the Israeli Jewish population also descends from Middle-Eastern Jews, up until the point that they were also the absolute majority of the Israeli Jewish population up until the '90s. That's also no coincidence when you consider that the Jewish communities in the Arab countries faced a lot of violence shortly before and after the establishment of the state of Israel (ex. the Farhud), pushing them to emigrate en-masse. That, and there weren't all that many Jewish immigrants from Europe, simply because there weren't all that many European Jews left because of the Holocaust.

That said; European and American Jews nonetheless had a disproportionate amount of power in Cold War-era Israel, and that did cause some fucked up situations.

This one's impressively shoddy as well:

&gt; There were Palestinian people living there for thousands of years

Palestinians as a group are the mixed descendants of Arabs from abroad and Arabized (and usually also Islamized) locals - so as a distinct group, they simply didn't exist before the rise of Islam. Which in turn means that they don't go back much further than 13 centuries. 

Christian Palestinians also exist, and they ostensibly go back to Roman times. But they're also a mixed bag - they're the mixed descendants of Christianized locals and Greek, Roman and other settlers from abroad. But IIRC Byzantine Palestine never actually had a Christian majority - even as late as the 6th century, Jews, Samaritans and Christians were about a third of the population each.

(on a tangentially related note: after the Muslim conquest, the Christians in Palestine and elsewhere in the Levant seem to have become Arabized very quickly. Even if they made a point of remaining Christian, they made no bones about adopting the Arabic language - even though their counterparts in northern Iraq and Egypt really clung to their native languages for centuries)

TL;DR: it's complicated, but you just can't say that ""the Palestinians have been living there for thousands of years"" - not in the least place because their group hasn't even existed for nearly that long.

...and claiming that the Israelis are ""just as bad as the nazis"" is also simply wrong. Because if that would've been the case, _there would have been no Palestinians left between the river Jordan and the Mediterranean_.

The Unprecedented Apocalypse in the Archbishop of Harioupolis

 xarioupoloes

 By Alexander Delopoulos

 We are watching with interest the developments in the former Province of Russian Orthodox Christian Traditions in Western Europe.

 Before referring to the subject, let us briefly mention that this particular Exarchate was created by the Ecumenical Patriarchate at the beginning of the 20th century.

 The Ecumenical Patriarchate, by its decision in November 2018, dismantled this Exarchate and demanded that parishes be subordinate to the local Holy Metropolis of the Ecumenical Throne in Western Europe.

 We note that the Archbishop of the said Exarchate until the day before yesterday was Harriopolis Ioannis, who on the proposal of the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, was elected in February 2015 Bishop of Harriopolis and in April 2016 he was elevated.

 The issue became of interest when Archbishop Harriopolis refused to accept the decision of the Ecumenical Patriarchate to dissolve, which is not the case in Orthodoxy, since the hierarchs always obey their Ecclesiastical authority.

 Unfortunately, the message was not properly conveyed to the communities and parishes of the Exarchate that after the decision of the Ecumenical Patriarchate they remain as they are, with the same legal status, but are now spiritually and administratively subordinate to the local Holy Metropolises of Throne, but the message has been conveyed that  The Ecumenical Patriarchate does not want them and must submit to another ecclesiastical jurisdiction!

 At this point we should mention that in the Diaspora there is a phenomenon in one city or region that there are many Orthodox bishops based on national criteria, something which is strictly forbidden by the Church's Church Rules.

 That is, although the Self-Healing Volumes of the Second Millennium Churches restrict them geographically to specific geographical boundaries, they have ordained Bishops for areas outside their boundaries such as, e.g.  in Western Europe, America, Australia and the Far East.

 In these areas, therefore, besides the local Priests and Provinces of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, there are also Priests and Provinces of other Churches.

 Archbishop Harriopolis therefore proposed various solutions to the communities and parishes that were not in line with the decision of the Ecumenical Patriarchate.

 This was perceived by the Fanari as disobedient to the Holy Synod which is its Ecclesiastical Authority and to the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew who personally elected him and recommended him to the Holy Synod to elect him Bishop.  In such cases the Sacred Rules are very cruel and impose severe penalties.

 Thus, the Holy and Sacred Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate decided on August 30 to dismiss Archbishop Iarioupolis of Ioannis, something that has happened for centuries to the hierarchy of the Ecumenical Patriarchate.

 But the matter is ongoing.  Archbishop Ioannis has long been planning a General Assembly of the parishes of the former Exarchate for the coming Saturday 7th of September in Paris, which according to their Charter is presided over by the Archbishop who is normally elected and ordained by the Ecumenical Council.

 After his dismissal from the Ecumenical Patriarchate, however, he does not accept the decision of the Holy Synod, informing the clergy to continue to refer to him as a regular pastor, stating that he did not formally request an apology, so the Ecumenical Patriarchate  (;).

 Normally, since he is no longer the Archbishop of the Exarchate and not even the hierarch of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, how will he preside over this Assembly?  Will the Convention be annulled or chaired by Harriopolis as if no decision was ever taken by the Ecumenical Patriarchate?

 Is the Apocalypse unpopular by the next Sunday when the Convention is over - and the possible parishioners joining another jurisdiction - and will be welcome by next Sunday?

 So it is very interesting how things will turn out and we wonder if in such cases the Orthodox Church should exhaust all grace.

 Are these actions a side effect of the last period's orthodox upheaval?  Whatever the case, we look forward to seeing developments this coming Saturday with great interest.",True,False,False,,,0,1567453850,,False,0,{},eyu6098,True,t3_cxww7t,False,True,t3_cxww7t,/r/Orthodoxy/comments/cxww7t/synod_of_cple_replaces_abp_jean_with_metr_emmanuel/eyu6098/,False,,1575985251,1,True,[],False,Orthodoxy,t5_2ufn0,r/Orthodoxy,public,0,True

Yes it is. That's the point of capitalism. That's how capitalism keeps prices low. Otherwise your just describing a micro dictatorship. 

&gt; ""Crony"" capitalism is invevitable. Since you believe in demonstrations, please demonstrate a nation in which your definition of capitalism has not turned into your definition of ""crony"" capitalism.

Even in communist societies apparently. I don't disagree with this, but this isn't capitalism doing this. This is human nature. And we've seen it in every other system too. And its worst in Russia and China. 

&gt; I mentioned nothing of market economics. We were talking about capitalism. And that still makes your point invalid.

So capitalism has been around for 200,000 years. You completely ignored the point of that paragraph. You have an elaborate exaggeration in order to pressure your argument based on something completely unrelated. You lied.

&gt; Depending on where you were, you either had collective farming or you had farming owned by a monarch. No real inbetween.

Not true. Collective farming has never happened. As long as people have grown crops there has been property and private owership. Why? Because when there isn't then freeloaders will just steal your crops and your hard work from you. And there's evidence for the fair exchange of goods and barter economies going back to the very beginning. Your claim that people just shared their crops is a lie.

&gt; If you're proposing collective killing then one would assume everyone who killed wouldn't end up in prison. And I agree, cooperation is much better than competition.

So many levels of dumb here once again. This *IS* a description of competition. You're collectively eradicating a competing group in this scenario. Competition and cooperation are not opposites. Your only arguing with emotional connotations. Its genuinely sickening. 

&gt; Technology developed by states and then released into the public sector, which were then given incentives by the state.

You mean capitalism?

&gt; A state is not a free market.

Many states are. But the global free market IS the American market. There's a reason why their dollar is the dominant currency, and its because of the success of capitalism in America and the rapid change that occurs in every capitalism in response to that overwhelming economic success. America started the trend that lead to globalism, which other economies aligned with. Today's free market is a direct, genetic descendant of the US economy. 

&gt; But we still need to get rid of it, right?

&gt; Yes

But not for any reasons, apparently. lol. This is just laughable. You refuse to support your claims at all costs. You're not equal to a rational person. 

&gt; If you think they're communist, the communism has achieved what you were proporting to capital the fastest. It wasn't, though.

And it never is based on your definition. 

I said it before and I'll say it again, your definition doesn't refer to anything real. And I'm not concerned with make-belief. 

&gt; It's literally apart of their ideology. Not trying to ""control"" it, they impliment and enforce it.

Because they've realize that its the only way they can compete. Even if they were to implement a true communism, it would just go into a depression since its not competitive. 

&gt; ...notice the word step there? Almost like their ideology was about having a transitionary period consisting of steps towards communism.

I noticed it the first time you said it. You you think this is some kind of prophecy? Just because some tool criticizes an economic system that actually works does not make his claims valid. 

Your honestly just repeating the same claims over and over again, and pretending that I'm not responding to them when i am. And how else would to maintain a lie? You covered your ears and ignore the facts. That's how. There is a reason why make-belief survives and you're demonstrating it. This is literally no different than citing bible verses or verses from the quran at face value. You're not even explaining why his quote is valid. You're just repeating it over and over again like a hail mary. 

&gt; Yea I thought you'd get a kick out of that.

And I expect you to think that. How else would you purport a baseless lie? False moral superiority. I've called you out on it multiple times. Appeals to emotion, emotional connotations, false moral superiority, and peer pressure. This is how you convince someone of something that is false. This is what all snake oil relies on. You think you're being clever, mostly because false moral superiority is an attempt to regain a sense of success when faced with failure, but that's not smart, that's a reactionary response. The only thing you proved to me is that you feel bad and that you desperate want to feel good. But your feelings don't tell you about real events. They expose your motives.

&gt; State capitalism is not communism. They were communists, yes, but they never achieved communism.

State capitalism is what happens when people try to pretend communism works. No one's achieved it because it doesn't work. And all those other examples are cases against the case for communism. 

But its easy to pretend that communism works when you literally ignore all the valid evidence. And that applies to any BS.

&gt; In china and russia I wholeheartedly agree with you, it was a lie by the bourgeois to promise revolution when there would be none. That's why you can't achieve communism through a dictatorship of the proletariat.

Finally something we agree on. 

&gt; Well if you differentiate crony capitalism and capitalism, then clearly not. Point to a capitalist state that isn't crony. It doesn't exist. Therefore capitalism must not work, right?

No, because capitalism is still an ongoing success. Not all businesses are dominated by monopolies. In markets with competition, we still see development, and owe pretty much ALL of our current economic development to it. Nice attempt at wordplay, though. Wordplay doesn't work when confronted with the facts, though. Look at China, for example. They're finally embracing state capitalism and now they're one of the most economically successful nations in the world right now. And they're on the forefront of a lot of genetic, computer science, and other technological innovations. Thanks to capitalism. 

&gt; I mean that's understandable, I defined them for you and you're not keen on definitions so I guess I shouldn't have expected you to remember them.

You didn't. 

&gt; Combating poverty yes, petite bourgeois no. All left-wing economic philosophies advocate for the worker's ownership of the means of production. Not small private business ownership of the means of production.

Your realize that business owners are workers too, right? And are you trying to pretend that liberals everywhere actually are actually fighting for public ownership and publicly run companies? Because if you are, you're lying. That is certainly not true for the liberal party in my country. Or in the US. Or in the UK, or Australia, or anywhere in Europe. 

What would you possibly be basing that claim off of. Well, I guess since you refuse to support your claims I'll never know.

&gt; I mean yeah, but they use it to mean liberal (or anything left of it), which is precisely what you're using it for now... hm...

They use it to demonize liberals to further bipartisanship and imply that the term has an emotional connotation. Ie that lefist *is bad.* Which is lazy reasoning and essentially just boils down to populism. That's counter democratic and obvious coercion. 

&gt; It's really not, though. It originated in the 1880s to help differentiate the left, liberal, and right.

It only fell into popular use within the last 5 years, and it certainly isn't the same definition as the 1880s term. That's now how the term is used today.

&gt; Why do you think they had a revolution in the first place? Because they felt like it? Because there was some wind and there was some nice weather?

Why does every revolution happen? Nationalism and romanticism. And you realize that every dictatorship and dynasty starts with a revolution as well. 

Its an emotionally appealing term meant to bypass a person's reasoning faculties. Revolution means a lot of different things, and rarely does one end up the way it was intended to. Especially when people are poor and hungry and illiterate. We've seen this trend repeat since literally 3500 bce. The oldest writings ever written talk about empires and revolutions. 

Also I love how you ended that on an insinuation instead of leading up to anything. If it were me who said that, you could expect me to clarify that in the next post. Or at least to qualify it with a rationally inferred claim. You won't though. Insinuations take much less effort while also taking fewer risks. And rely on peer pressure and nudges to direct the answer that you're looking for. And again, that's always been the case. 

&gt; No, bipartisan is a lie to shift everyone rightwards.

Unless you insinuate that its a bad thing, directing gullible listeners to shift left instead. It works both ways and you doing exactly this. That's why you claimed that capitalism is right wing when capitalism originates from and flourishs in liberal democracies. 

&gt; Are not left-wing and are not leftists. 

Oh great. Now leftists refers to something imaginary just like communism does. I honestly think that you're just relying on these terms as crutches to insinuate something you really want to be true but just can't quite put it into words. And if you can't reason your beliefs, then they're probably not rational. 

&gt; but as long as they advocate for private ownership

It looked like it was going to be just another day in a long string of just another days. Traffic sucked, again. Some asshole was parked in my spot, again. And the AC in my department wasn't working properly, again. If it wasn't for the fact that I shared a cubicle with Geoff, I wouldn't bother getting out of bed. But the chance of getting into bed with him made all the crap worth it.

Geoff. Gorgeous, ginger-haired, gym-bodied Geoff, with the emerald eyes and the pearly teeth. Geoff, with the slight Irish lilt, and the European cologne that I can only catch a whiff of when I get too close. Geoff, with the finely-tailored wool suits that hold his form like a superhero in disguise. Geoff, whose only flaw is that he is straight.

Somehow, him being unavailable makes me want him all the more. The fact that he's nice to me, considerate of my opinions, generous with his praise and articulate with his critiques, all that plus I can't have him, makes it hurt, makes it hurt really good.

But, as it happened, today wasn't to be just another day, because as I sat at my computer waiting for it to boot up, Geoff, beautiful Geoff, entered the cubicle and ran a hand across my shoulders as he said hi and sat down.

This was his usual greeting, and it made me melt every time, but for some reason, today I had a bug up my butt that just wasn't going to come out.

&gt; Disturb formed in 1999 in Marseille, France. They play a fierce metal hardcore in the vein of Hatebreed / Terror / Sworn Enemy / Madball led by 2 vocalists that sublime the catchy, furious guitar parts and the powerful, fast and groovy drums fills. They recorded their first 3 songs demo in 2000, so that they could start to spread their music over Marseille area and play shows alongside local bands such as Indust, Unfit, Inmate, Fat society, Eths, Romeo is bleeding to name a few. Sept 2k1, and after quite a bunch of concerts, the band got ready to record 6 new songs to appear on the critically acclaimed The last resort, released on its own label Locust on fire records and dealed throughout France by Musicast During the 2 years that followed the release of The last resort Disturb performed in many places in France, Belgium, Spain and Switzerland, thus having the luck to share the stage with names like Nostromo, lEsprit du clan, Arkangel, Do or die, Terror, Liar, Length of time, among countless others.. 2k4, the band decided to keep away from the stage for a while, then taking time to focus on the writing of their 1st full length, The Worst Is To Come, that they finally recorded in May at All ProdStudio again, and released on Customcore records. Not only this new record saw the arrival of new singer Julien, to replace Greg who left the band just 2 weeks before the band started the studios sessions, but it unveils the band in its most accomplished musical shape to date. Disturb have taken time to work and detachment to mold their influences in a more personal song writing that definitely emerges on the 10 explosive tracks of the album. The quality of their music now allows them to challenge some of their european and american peers Just after the production of the new album was over, Disturb participated the Furyfest in Le Mans as a 1st live test for their freshly packed and ready to sell new album. There they performed on the main stage in front of nearly 4000 kids, the same day and place where bands like Nasum, Terror, Unsane, Dying Fetus and other Slipknot did. Today the band still is looking for shows and a new deals for distribution outside France and Europe and really is eager to grow bigger and spread its music wherever its possible.

...PISA does not say that. It deals with mathmatics, science and reading (i.e. understanding). By the way, one of Italy's great problems is that the focus of the education system is still on humanistic subjects (history, literature...) rather than scientific subjects, hence Italy is doomed to fare poorly in a ranking which is mostly based on scientific subjects.

That is about the entire population, including loads of old and middle-aged people (who make up the majority of Italy's population) who never studied foreign languages, or studied very little, decades ago. This topic is about *young people*. I feel you would fail a PISA reading text, since apparently you did not read the title...

And these are all well below Italy. I also think it would be unfair to consider Turkey as a third world country, but that's just my opinion.

The USA I've vaguely heard about, but France, Sweden, Austria, UK (not much above Italy), Iceland, Luxembourg, Israel (below Italy) are all ""very criticised for its education""? Source?

&gt; You said Italy wasnt that bad because they were number 33 in THE WORLD.

And I repeat that: since the countries that aren't among those 70 are extremely poor, underdeveloped countries, which are extremely unlikely to outrank Italy.

By the way, this topic is about young people who (claim that they) can **read and write** in English: not **speak** English. Again, despite Norway's high PISA rankings, I feel you wouldn't rank very high in the reading test.

I've been to other countries in Australasia, Asia, Europe (Balkan, Eastern Europe) North &amp; South America (Central America and the Caribbean and the Antillas region),  even in the USA rural areas, there is very limited/scarce home internet or mobile phones service. I see people use their Shortwave radios to stay in touch with the world. It's a necessity and an emergency, to stay in touch with the world. Unlike the internet, sooner or later they can be an emergency (Huracanes, natural storms, even, a blackout, or war) the only way to stay in touch is with the radio, and what if they is no AM/FM. A shortwave radio can be an emergency.  As it's happening a serious situation in Southeast Asia, the government blocked all communications in a region and the only way to bypass is by Shortwave. Even, a serious situation in Australia, when the ""conservetive"" party decide to decline and shut down the radio frequencies, the people living in rural areas or Outback regions, lost their source of communication, but they never complained or write letters.  

Sadly, to be frank, I sometimes listen to the radio streams in XnY Radio apps but is not or feels the same as shortwave radio. The sound and vision of the radio, unlike on the radio, the transmission is ""on momentum"" but on the internet, the same transmission your listening, it can delay about 10 or 5-second delay. The worst-case scenario, the buffering and what if the Internet service gets disrupted.

Unfortunately, essential radio stations, for instance, Radio Australia services where (temporarily ""fingers cross if it comes back"") shut off, supposedly (PUN INTENDED) that the equipment was outdated and very EXPENSIVE, unlike the internet services, same goes with regular radio, but the only way they get the money is by ""product adverts"" is the exact scenario, it's very expensive to broadcast as well. Same goes with the BBC, in which ended services in the Americas, but you can get ""fair"" service in the Africa region! Even, for budget reasons (or to increase the wages for the greedy executive board members). As one of the members posted ""It's been central to broadcast shortwave being de-funded by governments.  The only way to continue the services, send your QSL reports to those radio stations, and they will notice that there listening. As my grandpa once told me, if you want your voice, talk!

Congrats on joining the Shortwave community, and purchasing a shortwave, the rules, patience, have fun listening, write QSL reports, and enjoy.

You specifically stated that the existence of these relatively lower fares ""didn't mean anything for the customer"". I like to think that saving money means a great deal to consumers - so which position are you actually taking?

&gt;You went off on some unrelated tangent

There's nothing unrelated about it. We're discussing the difference in fares between no-frills options and standard options. This means we need to look at the cost of the no-frills fares relative to the full fare. These no-frills options enable customers to save around 20-30% on their fares, which is significant.

The reasons why flights in Canada are generally more expensive than flights in certain other markets have already been brought up. Taxes, regulations, and market conditions differ significantly between Canada, the United States, and the European Union. A round trip fare from Calgary to Vancouver, for example, will cost me more in Airport Improvement Fees($50) than the entire fare for a round trip flight from [London, UK to Gdansk, PL](https://skiplagged.com/flights/LON/GDN/2019-09-26/2019-10-03)($46).

&gt;Quite a bold move to point to something completely unrelated like profit margins to prove there isn't a state-sanctioned duopoly in play.

Profit margins are absolutely relevant to the discussion about monopoly/[oligopoly](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/oligopoly.asp). One of the key features of an oligopoly is companies colluding in order to achieve above normal market returns. The fact that Westjet and Air Canada *aren't* achieving above normal market returns(when compared with their international peers) suggests that they are likely not an oligopoly.

&gt;They just could not hypothetically compete with better airlines if domestic routes were to be opened up to meaningful competition.

Perhaps you'd prefer it if I pointed to the [dozens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_airlines_of_Canada) of regional airlines operating in Canada as well. Did you forget you could fly throughout BC and parts of Alberta on Central Mountain Air? Maybe you haven't heard of Flair either, which flies to larger cities across Canada. There's also PAL Airlines, which flies to 22 destinations throughout the Maritime Provinces and Quebec. There's also Porter Airlines, which offers services throughout Eastern Canada and destinations in the United States. Funnily enough, all of these carriers offer similarly priced fares to your so called duopoly. 

&gt;Part of what skews WestJet and Air Canada's profit margins downwards is the fact they still have to compete with better airlines for international routes and from experience, have never had the lower fare in almost two decades when competing with the likes of Alaska and Delta.

Nonsense. Let's look at some flights. We'll look at round trip fares between various Canadian and foreign cities with a departing flight on the 26th of September and a return on the 3rd of October.

On the [Toronto-NYC](https://skiplagged.com/flights/YTO/NYC/2019-09-26/2019-10-03#) route, the 12 cheapest flights are offered by Canadian airlines. The cheapest flight is offered by Air Canada. On our return, the cheapest 15 flights are offered by Canadian airlines. The cheapest flight is offered by Westjet.

On the [Toronto-Chicago](https://skiplagged.com/flights/YTO/CHI/2019-09-26/2019-10-03) route, the cheapest 11 flights are offered by Canadian airlines. The cheapest flight is offered by Porter. On our return, the cheapest 6 flights are offered by Canadian Airlines. The cheapest flight is offered by Porter. Air Canada fares are priced the same as United on both the departing and returning portion of this flight.

On the [Toronto-Miami](https://skiplagged.com/flights/YTO/MIA/2019-09-26/2019-10-03) route, Air Canada offers the cheapest departing flight. 

On the [Toronto-London, UK](https://skiplagged.com/flights/YTO/LON/2019-09-26/2019-10-03) route, the cheapest 8 flights are offered by Canadian Airlines. The cheapest flight is offered by Air Canada.  On our return, the cheapest 2 flights are offered by Air Canada.

On the [Calgary-Seattle](https://skiplagged.com/flights/YYC/SEA/2019-09-26/2019-10-03) route, the cheapest 2 flights are offered by Westjet. 

On the [Calgary-Portland](https://skiplagged.com/flights/YYC/PDX/2019-09-26/2019-10-03) route, the cheapest flight is offered by Westjet.

On the [Calgary-Paris, FR](https://skiplagged.com/flights/YYC/PAR/2019-09-26/2019-10-03) route, the cheapest flight is offered by Air Transat. On our return, the 3 cheapest flights are offered by Air Transat.

On the [Vancouver-Denver](https://skiplagged.com/flights/YVR/LAX/2019-09-26/2019-10-03) route, the cheapest 6 flights are offered by Westjet and Air Canada.

On the [Victoria-San Fransisco](https://skiplagged.com/flights/YYJ/SFO/2019-09-26/2019-10-03) route, the cheapest departing and returning flights are offered by Westjet. 

On the [Victoria-Los Angeles](https://skiplagged.com/flights/YYJ/LAX/2019-09-26/2019-10-03) route, the cheapest 2 flights are offered by Westjet. On our return, the cheapest 25 flights are offered by Canadian airlines. 

On the [Montreal-Fort Lauderdale](https://skiplagged.com/flights/YUL/FLL/2019-09-26/2019-10-03) route, the cheapest departing and returning flight is offered by Air Canada. 

On the [Montreal-Orlando](https://skiplagged.com/flights/YUL/ORL/2019-09-26/2019-10-03) route, the cheapest 2 departing and returning flights are offered by Air Canada.

I could keep going, but my takeaway so far is that Canadian Airlines are offering reasonably competitive fares on most routes. Even when they aren't the cheapest, Canadian airlines appear to be offering reasonably similar fares to their international competition. 

&gt;Even bolder, still, to cite other countries pulling this bullshit as to why Canada must do the same. 

I gave you a couple of reasons *why* Canada does the same. Security is a big one, as you don't want an integral part of your transportation and logistics infrastructure controlled by foreign firms. You'd be handing a considerable amount of influence over our country to whichever nation(s) manage to develop a foothold in our market. At the same time, you would be hurting Canadian firms and killing Canadian jobs. No sane government would give up those two things in favour of slightly cheaper(maybe?) air travel.

&gt;Why doesn't this protectionism seem to impact domestic travel in markets only slightly bigger or perhaps even smaller than Canada?

Because there are more factors at play than just protectionism. Taxes and market conditions play a significant role in determining price, as do other regulations. 

I'd also encourage you to have a look at the [Aviation Price Index](https://www.kiwi.com/stories/aviation-price-index/usd/) put together by Kiwi. This largely shuts down the nonsensical narrative you're pushing. Canada's cost/100km is comparatively low when considering low cost(20th cheapest) and full service(8th cheapest) domestic flights. Our overall average cost is skewed by absurdly high full-service international flight costs.

&gt;It's stupidity to walk away without a deal

You clearly don't have very good knowledge of how deals work. We should've walked away years ago, then negotiated the deal after. You act as if the EU countries gain nothing from having a free trade deal with us when in fact [the rest of the EU sold about¬†¬£67 billion¬†more to us in goods and services than we sold to them](https://fullfact.org/europe/uk-eu-trade/). I'm sure they won't be happy losing out on that ¬£67 billion, looking at how much they're panicking over us refusing to pay the 'divorce bill'.

&gt;as it makes negotiating the Trade deal more difficult afterwards.

Untrue. Where's your source?

&gt;The notion that leaving without a deal will ensure a better deal is just daft.

Leaving without a deal is the most likely option and what many people want at this point. It's been 3 years yet Parliament have failed to achieve anything considerable. Remainiacs complain about 'uncertainty' yet keep wanting to delay things in hope it'll just be forgotten. It won't go on much longer, we no longer have a weak Remainer PM. Majority of businesses have been ready for No-Deal for years, it's time the Remainiacs accept the inevitability of Brexit.

&gt;Leavers need to calm down and acknowledge that the reason Brexit hasn't happened is because the Tories can't agree with themselves.

['Leavers need to calm down' - Whilst the Remainiacs are spouting that people they disagree with should be gassed?](https://twitter.com/LeaveEUOfficial/status/1168132280096874496) Nice logic.

In this song, Slipknot lead singer Corey Taylor is reminiscing about a bully who used to pick on him. Taylor often talks about how his disgust for bullies and anyone who uses their strength to hurt people who don't deserve it. In this song, he has finally snapped and is letting loose his aggression, singing about his desire to kill this guy and make him feel the pain he has inflicted.¬† This song was brought up in a murder trial of Jason Harris and Amber Riley, who killed their friend Terry Ray Taylor the night of May 23, 2003 in San Bernadino, California. According to testimony, Harris and Riley recited lyrics to this song as they repeatedly stabbed and nearly decapitated Taylor. As past trials involving Judas Priest and Ozzy Osbourne songs proved, Slipknot bears no legal burden for their lyrics, but predictable outrage ensued, with pundits blaming Slipknot for contributing to the delinquency of the killers, citing lyrics like ""I want to slit your throat and f--k the wound.""¬† There will always be some disturbed individuals who misappropriate and artist's work, and that happened again with Slipknot in 2008 when a kid in South Africa wore a Slipknot mask to school and killed another kid with a sword. Corey Taylor responded to this incident by saying, ""At the end of the day, there are always going to be mental disorders and people who cause violence for no other reason than the fact that they're f--ked up and lost.""¬†Slipknot drummer Chris Fehn told us that he could relate to the judgments and put downs many kids endure, and that Metal is a positive outlet for these kids, who often go on to great things. ""I wore Slayer shirts to junior high school and stuff. And people were like, ""you're just an idiot,"" said Fehn. ""These are the kids that run the world, and people need to recognize that. It's not the kid that has everything given to him. I just think that metal fans in general just have a passion for life that a lot of people don't get.""

###Duality ^Vol3

Duality is the quality or character of being twofold; dichotomy. In this song, the singer hurts himself to relieve his pain, which shows that he will not let anyone rule him or destroy him.¬† Lead singer Corey Taylor: ""Did you ever get that headache that is just not going to go away, and you end up sticking your thumb and your middle fingers so far into your eyes just to stop the pain? It usually has to do with making a choice. you get to that point in everyday life that you have to make a decision that you may not want to, but your kind of pushed into making that decision.""¬† The video was shot in Iowa and featured a large group of Slipknot fans. Drummer Chris Fehn explains: ""They had an audition I think at some hotel in Des Moines, and the kids lined up. It was funny, because there were people that totally weren't into the band but just wanted to go down there and see if they could get into the video and stuff. And they're like, 'No, dude, get outta here.' But that was cool. I guess some kids flew in from Europe and got in the video.¬† This was released as the first single from Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses). The album contains almost zero profanity as a response to critics who said Corey Taylor relied on swearing in his lyrics.

###Eeyore ^SelfTitled

A hidden track on the Slipknot album, it's named after the sad donkey in the Winnie-the-Pooh children's books.¬† Slipknot's concerts are very intense and physically demanding. Answering the question, ""What are the songs that burn you out the most?""¬†drummer Chris Fehn (#3) told Songfacts: ""'Get This.' Or 'Eeyore,' because it's just such thrash metal. There's just like the headbanging so fast and it's so exciting. But, you know, they all burn me out on the first couple of shows, but then once the metal neck goes away, we're good to go.""¬† Corey wrote the song about a bully he used to witness not just moshing, but beating up and physically abusing the fans at their shows in the early days.

###Everything Ends ^Iowa

Chris Fehn wrote the chorus while Corey Taylor wrote the verses.¬†¬† Corey Taylor: ""It's about the last time I tried to commit suicide, and more to the point, the first day I figured out what life was all about. It's about the last day in a life I don't want to remember and about the first day in a life that I am living right now.""¬† When asked why he wanted to kill himself, Taylor said: ""Why does any 17-year-old guy want to kill themselves? A chick of course! I thought she was the be and end all of everything and when you are that age, those emotions won't let you f---ing consider reality. I was in a really, really painful place. I put 31 slashes on my arm and I took a bottle of pills and a friend found me and took me to hospital. Luckily the cuts weren't too deep but I still have the scars. They pumped my stomach, which was a completely f---ing horrific experience, one that I don't wish on anyone. They make you drink this stuff which tastes like maple syrup, which is why I can't eat pancakes for the rest of my life, that induces you to vomit uncontrollably. You then spew up everything you have eaten for the past week and then they give you this sh*t which tastes like liquid charcoal to calm your stomach down again.""

###.execute ^AHIG

Lead Singer Corey Taylor explained to Kerrang!¬†July 19, 2008 this song's origins came from a speech he heard. He said: ""I was over at (percussionist) Clown's old house and he pulled up a speech by (former US Vice President) Spiro Agnew given in 1970 (the infamous An Effete Corps of Impudent Snobs speech directed at Vietnam War protesters). And when we started putting this album together, that's what we wanted to use as an intro. So I took it and manipulated it and f-ked it up. But then I played it for Clown and he was like, 'That's cool, but wouldn't it be better if you took it and made your own deal about it?'. So I did.""

###Eyeless ^SelfTitled

""You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes"" is a quote lead singer Corey Taylor took from a homeless guy on the street while he was in California. The guy was just saying it over and over again.¬†The song was partly inspired by Corey's father, as seen in the phrase ""I am my father's son, cause he's a phantom, a mystery, and that leaves me nothing!""¬†¬† The song is often covered by Bring me the Horizon during their live set.

###Gehenna ^AHIG

Lead singer Corey Taylor (from Kerrang!¬†July 19, 2008): ""It deals with obsession from the person with the obsession's point of view. And wanting to let go of the facade and being true to yourself, as monstrous as it may seem. It's badass! Vocally, I'm doing some s--t that I've never done before and its f--king disturbing, but very beautiful at the same time.""¬† Gehenna was the valley outside of the walls of Jerusalem at the foot of Mount Zion, which in Biblical times was a public rubbish dump. The names ""Hell"" and ""Gehenna"" were interchangeable.

###Gematria: The Killing Name ^AHIG

Lead singer Corey Taylor explained this song to Kerrang!¬†July 19, 2008 ""This song is not about my disgust of America, but more about its people. I love my country, I love the people that defend my country. I love the people that still exercise their right to disagree and voice their discontent, but there are a lot of people who are disguising politics as religion and dictating taste and turning it into policy, and that hurts me. Obviously you have to have both sides in a democracy, but it just seems like the scales have tipped so f--king far on the one side its untrue.""

###Goodbye ^TheGrayChapter

In 2010 Slipknot's founding bassist Paul Gray died of an accidental overdose of morphine and the painkiller fentanyl. This hard rock ballad is about the band's first meeting after the loss of their longtime friend. ""It's about the day we lost Paul,"" vocalist Corey Taylor told Rolling Stone. ""It's specifically about sitting in my house two hours after we found out, just shell-shocked, completely numb and then completely overwhelmed with what we were dealing with. It's a heavy tune, and it's on a whole other level for this band.""¬† 
He continued: ""Some of the lines were taken from the demo versions that I recorded in my garage, because they were moody, and had a unique vibe that was too hard to recreate. 'Goodbye' uses the full bassline that Corey recorded for his demo.""¬† When Shawn ""Clown"" Crahan first heard the words for this sentimental hard-rock ballad, he interpreted it to mean that Corey Taylor was quitting the band. ""That's how emotional we all were,"" the percussionist told Rolling Stone. ""You never know when someone's just gonna throw their arms up and go, 'I'm done.'""¬† Jim Root told Australia's The Music.com why he enjoys playing this song. ""I love the ambience of 'Goodbye'. I get to get really Radiohead with my guitar playing and pretend that I'm [Radiohead guitarist] Johnny Greenwood or something,"" he said. You know what I mean?

The atmosphere was so good that it became a cliche to talk about ""the magic of European nights at St James' Park"". The entire city seemed to come alive, moreso even than it does on a normal match day. It was all people were talking about, all that was in the papers. I was at school at the time and it seemed like almost nothing else was happening.

We famously beat Barcelona, a team containing Figo, Rivaldo and Luis Enrique, 3-2 at St James Park in 1997 in the CL group stage on what was probably one of the best nights at St James' Park ever: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVE316eqqXE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVE316eqqXE). Even the mention of that game brings back memories of Asprilla leaping like a salmon to meet Keith Gillespie's cross that looked like it was going over his head! We of course then threw it away by failing to beat PSV Eindhoven and losing 1-0 in the return fixture in Barcelona.

We had a similarly dramatic campaign in 2002, when we became the first team to qualify from the CL group stage after losing our first three fixtures in an incredible last-minute comeback against Feyenoord in Rotterdam in our last group stage game: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0wf-DR\_A6U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0wf-DR_A6U).

People assume that divine beings either live deep below ground or high in the sky. The sun, which is necessary for warmth and light, is in the sky. Water, which is necessary for life, comes from the sky in the form of rain. Lightning, which is terrifying to many, comes from the sky. The changing moon and what-the-heck-are-they stars are in the sky. Thus, people assume that gods come from the sky. Medicine was seen as a type of magic, and magic comes from either gods (in the sky) or demons (below the earth). 

In Egypt, as in many places, [illnesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_medicine#Magic_and_religion) were often thought to come from demons, curses, and the like, and thus you need a god to [cure](https://www.ancient.eu/Egyptian_Medicine/) them.

Also, [Thoth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoth#Attributes) wasn't the god of medicine... until the *Greeks* decided he was. *Imhotep* was the god of medicine--and he was a real person who got deified.

Their medicine was advanced, but not *that* advanced. They didn't even know about bacteria and viruses.

[Osiris](https://discoveringegypt.com/ancient-egyptian-gods-and-goddesses/) was shown with blue skin because it represented death (blue-gray corpse) or green because it represented life/resurrection. Hathor was also sometimes green for the same reason. Blue also represents protection (the blue of the sky = heavenly protection) and sometimes Bes was blue because he protected pregnant women.

If the concern is truly ones wellbeing then you'd logically go down the list of premature causes of death and devote resources sequentially to prevent them. You'll find that non gang related deaths as a result of breaking and entering are pretty far down that risk.

Can you see the milky-way from your observing location? Free view to the south (especially for planets)?

Summoned buy /u/Orlet, the 6mm I also already mentioned is the ""gold line"".

300/1500, 6mm -&gt; 250 (can already be too much when the  atmospheric seeing conditions are poor!)

A 4mm eyepiece or 3.2mm eyepeice is nice for the rare occasions atmospheric seeing is excellent. A HR Planetary clone 58¬∞ costs ~$25 or so and is still very affordable.

Avoid short Pl√∂ssl and kits. They are often not ideal for every telescope, redundant, short Pl√∂ssl under 10mm type have poor eye-relief. And zoom eyepieces have a very narrow apparent field of view on their lowest magnification, kind of neglecting their use for an overview eyepiece.

&amp;nbsp;

I have a 10"" (250) and 8"" (200mm) dobsonian. The difference it makes for observing is often not as large as you'd think, but the size / bulk is noticeable if you have strict space requirements. Just keep that in mind. 
Also shop around for a used one. If you don't mind the size, you may find a used 12"" in good condition (that someone else found to be too large  or just upgraded).

It was a fantastic weekend so I will share my ideas.  First, I've been to Singapore a few times so I was familiar with the city and getting around.  Depending on where you are staying and if you're there from Thursday -Monday or something else will matter how much you can see F1-wise.

As you know it will be hot and humid so dress comfortably, and have decent shoes since you may be walking a lot during the race weekend between the fan zones or browsing around the city to go to F1 events.  During the race the circuit will be very bright so consider that when you're taking pictures (lens, filters, etc).  On Saturday and Sunday there will be plenty of parties and party-zones for F1 fans which can be fun.  The city is generally costly so having Singapore dollars (SGD) and credit cards for any purchases would make it quick and convenient.  You may want to use the subway system or do more walking on the streets as I did for exercise.  If you have a 3-day ticket with access to multiple zones you will be doing a lot of walking so keep that in mind if you plan to bring a lot of gear or a heavier bag as you browse around in the hot daytime temperatures.

I arrived and bought a ticket locally through official sales and not the scalpers (street ticket sales).  It wasn't difficult, but I did cross paths with some F1 personalities while in the bigger hotel lobbys.  I met Eddie Jordan just after buying my tickets on Friday morning!

I stayed in the Intercontinental hotel for 3 nights, partly because I've stayed there a few times and it was a good value at only 600SGD/night (400 Euro) but they had a 3-night minimum which was perfect for me.

Things may be different now, but those hotel bars can be great for meeting people in the F1 community too.  That hotel has a bar in the back near the side entrance - it has a small actual bar but a lounge area that gets busy.  I met two Williams mechanics there and we were drinking at the bar and talking about F1.  I also met some others there during the weekend.  

The highlight was meeting Will Buxton and Jason Swales after the race in the bar - I have a good picture of this.  We were chatting about the race and they had wrapped there Off the Grid episode for Singapore that weekend.  Oh, the other thing about that hotel is that some of the smaller teams stayed there but the team bosses keep the team focused and I believe on European time so you won't see them during the daytime.   So from 12-2am it was post-race parties and bar time, then I was awake EARLY and hanging out in the hotel where I met even more people from the smaller teams as they were all hanging out, waiting for buses, etc.  So a cool environment overall.",True,False,False,,,0,1567471526,,False,0,{},eyut8f9,False,t3_cywuid,False,True,t3_cywuid,/r/formula1/comments/cywuid/any_tips_on_what_i_should_bring_for_a_race/eyut8f9/,False,,1575996423,3,True,[],False,formula1,t5_2qimj,r/formula1,public,0,

But you have to make these predictions on status quo for the most part and assume some uncertainty. 

Merrill lynch has India pegged to be the 3rd largest by 2028 after China and the US, and that I would say is fairly realistic. They are likely to pass Germany fairly quickly since Germany has been in negative or no growth for the past year, and after the UK leaves is only likely to go down for a while before picking up again, and Japan has been stuck at 1% growth for a long time. Passing the EU as a whole, maybe, maybe not. We'll have to wait and see, but EU growth isn't going anywhere fast, but India is coming up fast, and only getting faster. 

If the UK leaves with a deal, it won't really have left for another 2 years, as itll still be in the bloc over that time and still counted, which is what will give China the time to overtake. 

Japan may not have made it to the top spot becuase of its massive recession, but hey, 3rd place is still pretty darn tooting good haha.

Title: **[CH] Site has no option to delete account and support refuses to delete**

Original Post: 

&gt; I'm currently going through all my old unwanted accounts and trying to get them deleted. I'm having trouble with a particular site that functions (not just on their site) in both NA in EU that has no means of account deletion on the site. I contacted support and they said they refuse to do account deletions for NA accounts (I made it back when I lived in the states). I know that Right To Erasure is part of GDPR, but I'm not quite sure if it applies to me. I am a Swiss citizen, but from what I've understood about GDPR, it applies to all persons who's data is held/processed by an entity if that entity holds/processes data of EU citzens. Is this correct? If not, are there any Swiss-specific laws similar to GDPR's Right To Erasure?

Practice, practice, and then practice some more.

Being new and nervous is OK, being cautious is OK, and being careful is OK. With time and practice, all of those get better.

How many times did you drop your bicycle as a kid before you learned balance and control? Maybe you started out on a smaller bicycle with training wheels, and you rode around the driveway or backyard until you got better at balancing, steering, and stopping. Then the training wheels came off, and you graduated to bigger bicycles as your skills grew.

Motorcycling is much the same. It's easiest to start small, build your skills and your confidence, then progress as your time, experience, and budget allows.

As others have suggested, you have a few options here depending on your time, your cash flow, and your patience.

You can take the MSF course again, and get some more practice with onsite help.

You can practice more on your own in parking lots or smaller deserted roads.

You should pay close attention to your driveway, learn the rough spots, and maneuver to avoid them (also a great skill to have out on the road).

And maybe you drop the bike a few more times while you do these things, but just pick it up, shake it off, and keep practicing. You can always practice picking it up by yourself, so that you can do that more easily if it does go over. There are [videos](https://youtu.be/SXDNK_Ml7Hw?t=35) that show how to use your hands for balance only and use your legs to do the work, so even smaller riders can safely pick up larger bikes.

Maybe even look for a smaller, lighter, lower bike like the Rebel or something that you can feel more comfortable on. Either trade yours in, or keep the Interceptor and buy the Rebel, ride it for a few months or however long it takes you to build skills and confidence, then sell it and return to your dream bike once you have the confidence to ride it well.

   * ***Universal background checks and red flag laws***
   * ***A definition of assault weapons so they can be banned***
   * *Ban after-market magazines and feeder devices that increase capacity.*

**Ending the Influence of Lobbyists**

**90% of Americans support background checks. 85% support a red flag law.**

There are plenty of common sense gun safety laws out there with widespread public support. Why hasn‚Äôt Congress been able to get them passed?

Lobbyists.

Organizations like the NRA have spent over a hundred million dollars over the past decade, lobbying against any and all gun safety legislation. They‚Äôve spent tens of millions in a single year lobbying legislators to fight against even constitutional, popular gun safety legislation.

All the while, they‚Äôve been preventing the confirmation of any judge that would allow gun control legislation to be ruled unconstitutional. Our federal judiciary has been transformed over the past few years to the point where it will be difficult to overcome judicial activism in expanding the radical and expansive interpretation of the 2nd Amendment that has only recently taken hold after decades of lobbying by the NRA.

We need to get this money out of politics if we want to have any chance of ending the gun violence epidemic plaguing this country.

*As President, I will:*

* *Ban anyone who serves in my administration from lobbying for a period of time after they leave their position.*
* ***Refuse to hire anyone who formerly worked as a lobbyist for any gun rights or gun manufacturing organization in my Administration.***
* *Work with Congress to pass limitations on lobbying after leaving Congress.*
* *Pass a Democracy Dollars bill, putting over $20b directly in the hands of the American people to support politicians they agree with and drown out the influence of lobbyists.*
* *Pass a Term Limits bill to make it harder for lobbyists to develop long-standing relationships with Congress Members that prevent new ideas or legislation from passing.*
* *Consider ways to alter the makeup of the Supreme Court if they refuse to allow common sense gun legislation to be enacted, including implementing term limits.*

**Fighting the Rise of White Nationalism and Extremism**

**White nationalist terrorism has accounted for over 70% of terrorism-related deaths in the US over the past decade. Some organizations have stated that the number of white nationalist perpetrators of terrorist attacks has quadrupled since 2016. There is widespread agreement between law enforcement officials, both in the US and throughout Europe, that white nationalist and far-right terrorism are on the rise**. Law enforcement agencies in the United States have had an increasing number of interactions with these groups, resulting in the deaths of dozens of brave men and women over the past several decades.

These violent acts represent only a small subset of this toxic ideology. Some polls have found almost 10% of Americans believe it‚Äôs acceptable to hold neo-Nazi beliefs. **According to the Anti-Defamation League, both the volume of propaganda being spread by white nationalist groups and the number of public demonstrations have increased over the past several years. Some experts have pegged the number of white nationalists active in the community in the hundreds of thousands.**

**And they‚Äôre blending in better ‚Äì having traded in their ‚Äúboots for suits,‚Äù there has been a concerted effort by these white nationalist groups to improve their image, seem more respectable, get degrees, and work in law enforcement, media, and other places where they can spread their hateful ideologies to a wider audience.**

**We need to confront this threat head-on. In order to tackle the massive problems we face ‚Äì climate change, economic displacement, growing authoritarianism across the globe ‚Äì all Americans must be united. There‚Äôs no room for hateful and extremist ideologies in this country. It‚Äôs time that we get serious about confronting this threat.**

*As President, I will:*

* ***Call out white nationalism wherever it arises.***
* ***Establish a centralized location to aggregate statistics on white nationalism and domestic terrorism, possibly through an expansion of the FBI‚Äôs UCR.***
* ***Direct the Department of Justice to prepare and publicly release an Annual Report on Domestic Terrorism, in order to ensure all Americans are properly informed on this issue.***
* *Help victims of domestic terrorism:*
   * *Pass a Medicare for All system that fully covers mental health and trauma services for victims of domestic terrorism.*
   * *Maintain an opt-in database of victim‚Äôs support groups that‚Äôs publicly accessible.*
   * *Expand the Victim Services Division of the FBI to better serve individuals affected by these crimes.*
   * *Establish a victim‚Äôs fund to help victim‚Äôs of this violence recover.*
* *Instruct the Department of Justice, and the FBI in particular, to treat white nationalism and domestic terrorism as a central focus.*
* *Increase the budget for fighting domestic terrorism to match non-military spending on fighting foreign terrorism.*
* *Work with Congress to pass a federal statute creating a clear federal domestic terrorism offense, and provide for appropriately harsh punishment.*
* *Work with allies abroad to combat the rise of white nationalism*
* *End relationships with white nationalist political parties when possible; minimize contact and refuse to provide/sell any type of materials that could be used to further white nationalist goals to parties when ties can‚Äôt be cut completely.*

**Fight the Spread of Hateful Ideas**

The internet and social media have made it much easier to spread hateful ideas and ideologies. Dark corners of the web like 4chan and 8chan regularly see vile ideas shared and laughed at, and mass shooters will frequently post their manifestos to these sites. They also see commentary that cheers the shooters along and encourages others to commit violence. Social media services also see violent videos shared, such as when the New Zealand mass murder was streamed on Facebook.

We need to be very careful not to infringe on the First Amendment rights of individuals, but we also need to work to minimize the spread of incitements to violence on social media channels and websites.

The government should work with social media companies to combat the spread of violent rhetoric online, especially those that depict actual incidences of violence or call for specific acts of violence.

We also need to do more to get people out of their online bubbles and into local communities. We should investigate the impact of social media on our children and come up with guidelines on how much exposure is acceptable. All high school seniors should spend time traveling to a different part of the country to get exposed to different cultures.

*As President, I will:*

* ***Work with social media and hosting companies to minimize the spread of incitements to violence, while respecting First Amendment rights.***
* *Implement the American Exchange Program to allow all high school students to experience different areas of the country and form friendships with a diverse group of Americans.*

**Reforming Individuals Trying to Leave Hate**

**We must absolutely and unequivocally condemn white nationalism as an ideology. We must absolutely and unequivocally condemn any violence done in furtherance of this ideology. We must harshly punish anyone who commits a crime in order to accomplish the goals of this ideology. A single life lost as a result of domestic terrorism is too many.**

The only way we can possibly minimize the loss of life due to white nationalism-inspired domestic terrorism is to provide a way for those who are entrenched in this hateful world to leave, if they desire.

Non-profit organizations are much better equipped to do the work of reaching out to individuals who are trying to leave the white nationalist community. Life After Hate and Free Radicals are two such groups. I spoke with Christian Picciolini about the work he‚Äôs done on this front and the successes he‚Äôs had. We need to expand the work done by individuals like him.

Finally, we need to ensure that prisons have the resources necessary to combat white nationalist gangs, and provide services to individuals who are looking to leave these organizations and, upon release, rebuild their lives outside of the white nationalist community.

*As President, I will:*

* ***Invest millions in nonprofits such as Life After Hate and Free Radicals that help individuals disengage from white nationalist groups.***
* *Provide ancillary services when necessary to help individuals disengage from white nationalist groups, such as tattoo removal through the Medicare for All system.*
* *Ensure that all federal prisons have the resources necessary to help incarcerated individuals leave white nationalist groups when they de*

in European and East Asian nations, sure, a lot of pillaging and conquering going on there. in the America‚Äôs and Africa and other precolonial/indigenous lands‚Äîi.e. Philippines, Guam, Australia, New Zealand etc.‚Äîthings were never to this extent.

the reason everything is so warped and skewed now is because of the mass scale that European ‚Äòsettlers‚Äô colonized the world. they layed the foundation for our current structure of society‚Äîit‚Äôs literal and factual history.

I don‚Äôt have a magic solution to end capitalism but solving any problem starts with acknowledging that there is a problem‚Äîonly for the rich and wealthy there is no problem because everything is working as planned.

it‚Äôs evident in your response. I made absolutely no derogatory comments toward white people yet you claim racism.

you fear what you don‚Äôt understand and you don‚Äôt understand what I‚Äôm trying to explain so you‚Äôre quick to jump on the offensive as if me offering my insight is an attack.

this is not the best system humans have made‚Äîit‚Äôs the system white-colonizers founded on stolen lands. just because ‚Äòmodern‚Äô technology sprouted alongside this broken system doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs the system that allowed it to manifest.

if we really deconstructed the way our society functions (mind you plenty of solutions exist but aren‚Äôt marketable or don‚Äôt bring about long term profit‚Äîi.e. capitalism) I guarantee you life would be exponentially better for all. In fact I would challenge that we would be far more advanced than we are now if we didn‚Äôt waste our resources on war, genocide, and ‚Äòassets‚Äô.

there are plenty of solutions out there but people are afraid of change‚Äîespecially drastic change.

you believe this system works likely because you are white, white-passing, or white-adjacent, and it was made for you. it‚Äôs easy to pay no mind to other people‚Äôs suffering when you have the privilege of being complicit in a system that honors you as the ‚Äòmodel asset‚Äô (i.e. nuclear family, american dream... etc.) 

you cannot strip race from a society quite actually founded on racial divide‚Äîmind you, not even a century ago were people fighting for rights. even now people are still fighting for those rights and people like you seem to believe that just because things are *starting* to take a turn, that suddenly the traumas and horrors of the past have been healed and forgotten.

I interjected my statement because it applies. people are suffering in the world at the hands of other people and outside forces beyond their control‚Äînot themselves, not because of a flawed perspective... but because greed runs our world and the powers that be don‚Äôt care to do anything about it.

EDIT: PS you completely dismissed the part where I talked about the marginalization/ intersections beyond race‚Äîi.e. gender and class... etc.

the point is we can‚Äôt do anything to fix these issues because of people like you who refuse to acknowledge the reality.

race, gender, and class identities have been woven into the fabric of ‚Äòmodern society‚Äô‚Äîtechnology, philosophy, agriculture, artistry, etc. have all evolved beyond this current, far-outdated infrastructure. the rigidness of society cannot handle the abstractness that is ‚Äòhuman nature‚Äô‚Äîand the monopoly of capitalism instills that so long as there is profit in outdated or unethical methods, the benefits will be reaped before the side effects are realized.",True,False,False,,,0,1567477874,,1567480700,0,{},eyv1gms,False,t3_cypcfg,False,True,t1_eyuz53a,/r/PS4/comments/cypcfg/nierautomata_was_nearly_cancelled_because/eyv1gms/,False,,1576000356,2,True,[],False,PS4,t5_2rrlp,r/PS4,public,0,

You've massaged the numbers to make things look a certain way.  I ran the numbers, myself, based on the data in the links you provided.

The limitations of the data available made things a little difficult, on a cursory look I couldn't find a CSV on the gun policy website (if you can provide one, I will re-run the numbers), as such I've used intentional homicide per 100k (regardless of weapon) as a proxy.  That may color the data.  Additionally, certain countries (namely the UK and its constituents) are not listed because the data was not available separately in both datasets.  Lastly, the homicide data is from date ranges 2012-2016, as 2017-2018 was not provided.  The most recently available data was used for the country in question.

I'll be frequently referencing R^2 below.  Briefly, it's a measure of how well a dataset correlates to a line, in other words, how strongly the independent variable (X, or in this case, Guns per 100 people) determines the dependent variable (Y, or in this case, homicide rate).  What constitutes a 'good' R^2 (that is, indicates strong correlation) is difficult to determine - I'll be using 0.5 as a threshold for ""reasonable correlation"".

If we take a look at the data in your post, it looks like [this](https://i.imgur.com/0yLyTVH.png).  R^2 is 0.761.  That would imply a pretty solid correlation.  If I graph every country for which I had data, it looks like [this](https://i.imgur.com/TKgAT9e.png).  R^2 is miniscule, therefore no correlation.  Both of these assumptions are *wrong* for similar reasons - bad use of available data. One limitation of R^2 is that it can't be used to tell if there is bias in the data.

If we limit the dataset to only Western Europe, Northern Europe, and North America (leaving out Bermuda [for obvious reasons](https://i.imgur.com/NukH0EM.png)), we get [this graph](https://i.imgur.com/ZogZDL3.png).  Not as strong, now - R^2 = 0.131.  [What about all countries *less* violent than the US (including the US)?](https://i.imgur.com/kSq3sun.png)  And no, your eyes do not deceive you, Somalia is indeed on that graph (4.3 &lt; 5.4).

Which knobs do you want to turn?  All of these graphs point to there being little correlation between homicide and firearms ownership on the planetary scale.  This is true pretty much regardless of how the data is sliced.  The United States is an outlier in both categories compared to other first world countries, and an outlier for gun ownership compared to the rest of the world (that much should be obvious from its position on the graph alone).  As such, its presence in the dataset *alone* calls the conclusions drawn from that dataset into question, because it skews the data.  You wouldn't use Andre the Giant in a dataset about BMI, he's a statistical anomaly - so too is the United States.

""The strategy of world conquest of the Soviet Union springs from the premise that it is not yet strong enough to risk war with the United States but must build up its domestic war potential and bring new strategic areas, resources, and peoples under its control before attacking us. In preparation for attack on the United States, it is, therefore, consolidating its hold on the 130,000,000 Europeans it has dominated since 1939; striving to seize France and Italy by action of its fifth columns; pressing on Greece, Turkey, and Iran; and‚Äîusing the Chinese Communists as its instruments-attempting by war to conquer China.

Senior party insiders have been discreetly drawing up a list of constituencies where support from Lib Dem voters could be critical.

Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, wants to maximise the number of MPs opposed to no-deal who would be returned to the Commons in a snap election before October 31.

Tory MPs who vote in favour of blocking no-deal face being deselected by their party as Boris Johnson steps up pressure to persuade Brussels to offer him a better Brexit deal. Some prominent rebels, including Rory Stewart, who stood against Boris Johnson in the party leadership election, are considering standing as independent Conservatives if they are ousted by their party. Some of them might struggle to win if the anti-no-deal vote is split with the Lib Dems.

Consideration is now being given to making local pacts that would make defeating pro-Brexit candidates a priority over Lib Dem gains. One source familiar with the internal discussions said that decisions would be taken on a case-by-case basis. ‚ÄúIt is obviously easier to do in seats where Labour is the main challenger and other local factors, in terms of the strength of the candidate and the ground operation will also be taken into account.‚Äù


The Lib Dems have made similar local deals in recent council elections and they won the Brecon &amp; Radnorshire parliamentary by-election on August 1 after the Greens and Plaid Cymru stood aside. Any deal would have to be agreed by local party associations, which have considerable autonomy over candidate selection.

Yesterday a YouGov poll showed that while 61 per cent of current Conservative voters backed the deselection of the party‚Äôs no-deal rebels, 72 per cent of Lib Dems supported them being allowed to stand.

The Lib Dems have enjoyed a sizeable increase in support in recent months, doubling from about 10 per cent in April to about 20 per cent now. As a result the party has dramatically expanded its list of target seats, particularly in its former strongholds in the southwest and the Home Counties.

However, Ms Swinson is understood to believe that the party must not overreach in the coming election for fear of spreading its resources too thinly. Standing aside in some seats would allow the party to concentrate on target seats in particular regions.

Senior Lib Dems are understood to think that the party stands to make the biggest gains if a general election happens before October 31 and stopping Brexit altogether remains a theoretical possibility.

The Liberal Democrats now have almost 120,000 members, up a fifth in a year and almost double the number of paid-up members in the year before the EU referendum.

Ms Swinson tweeted yesterday: ‚ÄúIt seems Boris Johnson will stop at nothing to implement his anti-democratic shutdown of parliament and force a disastrous No Deal on the British people.

* **Johnny** ([u/Quirderph](https://www.reddit.com/u/Quirderph/) vs. [u/DarthDementous](https://www.reddit.com/u/DarthDementous/)):  Quiderph is still my pick to play Johnny, and I don't understand what you (Quiderph) mean about not being able to do an impression of him since you sound just like him. While [DarthDementous](https://www.reddit.com/u/DarthDementous/) has a nice attempt at the accent (though sounds a bit German at times), I run into the same issue as with Tarkin, where it at times does not quite sounds right, because there's just no replacement for the real thing. To my ears, someone speaking English with a Swedish accent is gonna be way closer to whatever Eastern European country Tommy Wisseau is from than just about any American. At the end of the day, you can tell it's an American trying to do the foreign accent, which can sound either a little underdone or overdone, compared to someone from that country or at least continent. In fact though he looks like he hails from a more Medditeranean area, we don't even know Wisseau is not Swedish. All that said, I do agree Darth's acting at times is slightly better, especially the line ""What I have to say"" which sounds a lot like Wisseau. But, to sum up, for me Quiderph is the choice because I believe it will be easier (possible) for him to get a line like ""What I have to say"" to sound like Wisseau while the accent comes naturally than it will be for Darth who may be the better actor, but for whom being American and probably not having spent much time if any overseas, that Eastern European accent will never come naturally.
* **Mark**  ([u/DarthDementous](https://www.reddit.com/u/DarthDementous/) vs [u/Sylarjr](https://www.reddit.com/u/Sylarjr/)) Both are pretty good. I know, based on the Han Solo performance that DarthDementous is capable of finding this guy's voice and making it work- that said, [Sylarjr](https://www.reddit.com/u/Sylarjr/) has the inflections and acting slightly better at this point. So to sum up, I agree with the above, Darth has the slightly better voice at this stage, [Sylarjr](https://www.reddit.com/u/Sylarjr/) has the slightly better acting.
* **Denny**  ([u/DarthDementous](https://www.reddit.com/u/DarthDementous/) vs [u/Sylarjr](https://www.reddit.com/u/Sylarjr/)): I agree that it's [Sylarjr](https://www.reddit.com/u/Sylarjr/) for this role, he's completely believable as Denny. Maybe that means Darth should play Mark, since Darth can certainly get there with the acting. But even if it's [Sylarjr](https://www.reddit.com/u/Sylarjr/) for both Mark and Denny, I also suggested Darth's versatility could lend itself to many other roles in this movie.

Let me just add on the issue of

Edited to clarify the point about the involvement of government because people don't understand how the British government works:

This legal change has come to about after decades of lobbying from the NHS and transplant teams who are crying out for organs. The various governments lobbied have all resisted a move to an opt out register because of silly religious reasons, rather than looking at the lack of organs for transplant. The introduction of mandatory seat belt wearing and the near elimination of drink-driving has dramatically reduced the number of organs available. This has led to the deaths of many who needed organs, but, because they weren't carrying a donor card, those organs went to waste.

My wife was part of a team working on experimental transplants using organs outside of the usual criteria - with great success when they could get an organ (that trial had it's funding withdrawn due to Brexit and the team, apart from the British people on it, moved to Berlin to continue to receive the funding from the EU).

First off, how are they ""settlers"" when they were in the west bank for 3500 years but were ethnically cleansed by the Arabs for 20 years? They return and are somehow settlers? Don't think so. 

Meanwhile the [Palestinians openly admitted](https://www.palwatch.org/main.aspx?fi=640&amp;doc_id=8210) that they have NO CLAIM on the west bank whatsoever. So how are they not settlers? They all but admitted they are. They only got the west bank bc Jordan illegally annexed it then gave it to the PLOca terror group, in 1988.

Moreso, ""settlers"" never kicked anyone out, but Palestinians have been doing that forever. They are serial ethnic cleansers. Jaffa 1914 - every single Jew forced out. Hebron 1928, horrific massacre and every Jew forced out. When tiny numbers of Jews return to Hebron where they lived for 3,500 years, they're somehow settlers?? But the Palestinians who murdered and stole their homes aren't occupiers?? Whatever.. And let's not forget the ethnic cleansings of Jews from the west bank and east Jerusalem in 1948. The Arab Quarter today WAS the Jewish quarter. So who's the one stealing ppl's homes exactly? Why don't you give me one example of a Jew settler stealing a single home from a Palestinian? It just doesn't happen.

As for stealing land, a Palestinian tradition! [They do it today tho too](https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5420967,00.html). Openly. All those ""illegal israeli settlements"" are perfectly legal and in Area C- per Oslo, Israeli land. But the Palestinians just announced they'd start issuing building permits in Area C, Israeli land. Of course they've been building [genuinely illegal settlements](https://m.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Land-of-Israel-Caucus-head-EU-funding-of-illegal-Palestinian-building-must-be-stopped-441057/amp) there this whole time anyway. 

So by your parameters, all the Palestinians are scum. Damn you are harsh! Esp since the Palestinians openly state that they view all of Israel as one big settlement. And that if the Palestinians get statehood, that's only triggers [phase two](https://ibb.co/qNZSw9D) of taking all of Israel. What scumbags huh? And they still openly talk about their [desire to ethnically cleanse](https://youtu.be/cJkxOF9QqEk) ever Jew from Israel as soon as possible. Scumbags, right? [Look what they teach their kids.](https://youtu.be/e2MMjc8ZXlI)

Wow, I bet you really hate the Palestinians now that you've finally learned something about the conflict. But go easy on them - it's not their fault the Arab League wants them to be refugees forever.

The PM is elected by the party not the people, whilst normally they don't change after an election there is nothing to say they can't. Officially, its not even a position in Parliament, just the representative of a majority of MPs. 

2. The UK voted to leave and the deal on offer had been rejected thrice, logic dictates no deal is the only option option. Whatsmore, the threat of no deal is a major chip in the negotiations with the EU - if you want to sell a TV, you don't open bargaining with ""Now, whatever else happens, what I want most is for you to have this TV. Even if I have to give it to you for free. Now, how much are you willing to pay?"". Its obvious that will lead to a bad price on the TV. 

3. He wants to hold a Queen's speech to set out a new legislative agenda, as is normal for a new government, and is fully within his rights to suspend parliament for four sitting days to do so. In addition, it helps to stop any late anti-brexit legislation that might hobble our chances in negotiations with the EU and stops his opponents dithering - allowing him to go to the EU summit knowing what cards he holds. 

4. Nobody is lingering. The PM did it, the queen approved. However a large amount of remain-supporting MPs want another extension for some reason and are trying to stop it. 

5. It will have ample time, both before and after the proroguing. However parliament can't agree on anything except not wanting any of the options. Parliament has the authority to stop Brexit, it doesn't have the majority. Deals are negotiated by the Government not parliament, whilst it has the power to it isn't a cohesive entity and thus is very badly suited to it. 

6. Remain MPs need a democratic mandate to stop Brexit without killing their careers, so in time-honoured EU tradition, want people to keep voting until the correct result is obtained. A general election is also possible as Boris has a majority of one and electoral calculus shows he'd get 30-100 with an election. However, its still a huge risk. 

7. Parliament doesn't reflect the people in the case of Brexit and are thus struggling to to find a solution to exiting the union. In addition, the proroging of parliament is a perfectly normal thing to do - the gov. also had the power to do until after October the 31st, but didn't.

1) The weather. Some people love it, I absolutely did not and will never complain about the UK weather again. The winter is not only insanely cold (-25 Celsius) at some points, it‚Äôs incredibly long. Snow hit November 15th and did not leave until April 17th last year. Spring just pisses it down.

2) Paid-time off. Welcome to North America, 28 days paid time off in Europe is crazy to them. In Canada, you are entitled to 10 days a year. So if you want to go home for a week, make that 5 days a year. You may get 15 days if you have been employed at the same place for 5+ years, but that‚Äôs not always the case.

I brought up Aspergers because I sent the debate link with AChilles to my friend, who subsequently showed her mother. He mother has worked with special needs children her whole life and she caught whiffs of high functioning autism in AChilles' posts. What she actually said was is that there is a range and a spectrum of autistic traits, and began to list them to me. She said AChilles possessed at least one or more of these traits; stubbornness, narcissism and obsession with things for long periods of time (him teaming in-game for hours on end).

Of course it's a long shot but I thought I'd use it to attack AChilles, since I myself found his responses very off, and his way of talking to other people, inept and condescending. Maybe that was wrong of me, *but AChilles is a troll dude*. He's just dry so people don't call him out on it. I felt it was about time somebody did, since he keeps passive-aggressively annoying people in the community, and if you think I'm exaggerating I bet I can get a bunch of people to testify my word as gospel.

In response to my knowledge about communism, I know about communism. I know how it sprang up in major parts of Eastern Europe after the Second World War and how it was enforced with ruthless brutality. There are obvious parallels between AChilles' YOGA gang and communism; I could easily go into this in another post, but safe to say the banding together of players under a common name,  campaigning to crush opposition and evangelise their ideology through colonial capture (which involves the YOGA gang invading ***private*** game servers), imposing rules and sanctions on its followers and a *clear striving for equality of outcome,* all of these things smell of communism to me.

In regards to Nietzsche, as you know he was a strong individualist, believing potently in the power of man to transcend his nature and become a superman. He heavily advised *against* listening to others, spending time with others and banding together like cattle. If anything, the soloist ideology is much more akin to the will to power. Whereas the teamer ideology might be found in the works of Karl Marx or Lenin, perhaps.

Just my thoughts.

I'm sorry but I'm not sorry. I have to stand up to communism if I see it.

&gt;  
&gt;As I said, the gun control within parts of a country is not a very effective way to push up the price of the illegal guns if there are no similar controls in other parts of the country. It is too trivial for people who want a gun to buy it from another state as there is no borders to cross to bring it back to the home state. The countrywide ban would stop this and make illegal guns much more expensive as is the case with automatic weapons. They are not any more difficult to produce, but since they can't be sold legally inside the US, they cost much more in the black market than non-automatic weapons.

Accessibility of guns has nothing to do with the murder rate if that were the case New Hampshire would have a higher murder rate than California

&gt;Yes, in Europe knife is the most likely weapon to be used in a murder than a firearm, but magically a lot fewer get killed. Why is that? I'd say that the main reason that you are just wrong. Firearm is much more deadly than a knife and furthermore when it comes to mass murders, it is almost impossible to kill a large number of people the same way as you can do with semi-automatic weapons with large magazines.

Probably Cultural differences Firearms are significantly more deadly at range but if you get close enough to be stabbed a knife is more deadly and doesn't make noise like a firearm does and gun control does nothing to decrease the rate of terrorist or indiscriminate attacks  
US 65 Terrorist Attacks 2017  1 Per 5,074,261 people 329,827,000 People Total  
UK 122 Terrorist Attacks 2017 1 Per 544,554 People  66,435,600  People Total  
Gun Control likely did not have a effect on the terror attack rate of the UK but if it did the only thing gun control did to the UKs Terrorist attack rate is increase it

&gt;Why not? We're not comparing some developing world countries, but countries economically and politically very similar to the US.

They are not similar politically European countries are significantly more to the left than the United states they have a different culture and they vote differently i am not familiar with whether or not they are economically similar to the US at all

&gt;Finland used to have the highest murder rate in Western Europe. People kept moving more to cities. The murder rate went down by a factor of five. Now Finland has about the same level of homicides as other Western European countries. Theory falsified. Try again.  
&gt;  
&gt;Oh, by the way also the male suicide rate has gone down by a factor of two as well. Women suicide rate hasn't really changed.

I don't know anything about finland so i can't say anything about this

&gt;What's the benefit of firearms? I can see some people using them for hunting, but the handguns have pretty much no benefit at all let alone military level rifles.  
&gt;  
&gt;Alcohol is used a recreational drug by millions. It is clear that banning it would lead to a disaster (see what happened during prohibition and what is going on with other drugs at the moment).  
&gt;  
&gt;If the guns had the effect that they were only harming the people themselves as alcohol does, I'd be less in favour of background checks etc. gun control methods, but since they are intrinsically meant to shoot other people, it is purely criminal not to restrict their availability to some people.

Benefits of Firearms  
Self Defense - When seconds matter the police are just minutes away (Which can range from 5-10 minutes in cities to 30-45 minutes in rural areas)  
Pest Control - Wolves Boars foxes ect  
Sport Shooting - It's cool as hell to watch  
Recreational Shooting - Target shooting is fairly fun

A AR-15 is not a Military level rifle they don't have select fire (Fully Automatic/Burst fire) and ""Military Level"" Is fairly meaningless if youre talking about Caliber then most AR-15s fire 5.56 which is a fairly small round if you're talking about Semi Automatics then that bans essentially all handguns and rifles

Guns don't harm people roughly 1 in every 950 guns is used in a crime about 1 in every 26,000 guns is used in a murder banning guns would be a emotional reaction that would do nothing but prevent people who are physically weaker than the average home invader (Women Elderly and Disabled people) from defending themselves it would also hurt people in rural areas who have to deal with pests like boars

Our Clan isn‚Äôt your typical clan, and we have very few rules we would ask you to follow, as long as you‚Äôre up for a laugh, not easily offended, enjoy a bit of drunk destiny or simply chatting nonsense you probably should come say hi and join our discord and get a feel of what our little group is like.

As well as banter we‚Äôre players with a mix of sweatiness, if week one raid clears are your thing, or you‚Äôve already collected all pinnacle weapons you‚Äôre gonna find people in our clan that are in that mindset. Or If you‚Äôre a casual destiny player  and you‚Äôre most likely to be more active during new events that‚Äôs fine, we get it, life get‚Äôs in the way sometimes. Whether you‚Äôre a new player or been around since D1 you‚Äôre more than welcome.

* Pi√π spesa e investimenti in ricerca, istruzione, ambiente. Meno tasse. No aumento IVA.
* Istruzione e sanit√† non si toccano.
* Vorremo fare pi√π debito, ma dobbiamo convincere l'Europa.
* Nessun accenno alle pensioni, direi che per il momento vogliono tagliare quelle.
* Molte cose ovvie o vaghe.
* Qualche punto chiaro e condivisibile.

Spiegone:

1. *Non facciamo aumentare l'IVA, aumentiamo investimenti in istruzione, meno burocrazia e sostegno a disabili e senzatetto, pi√π welfare*.  
Bello. Per√≤ i soldi non crescono sugli alberi. Cosa tagliamo, la sanit√†, l'istruzione o le pensioni? Io spero nella terza.
2. *Meno tasse ai lavoratori, salario minimo*  
Pi√π tasse per i datori, quindi? Ok, ma loro non sono n√© di destra n√© di sinistra, giusto? Oh, a me sta bene eh.  
*Prevenzione infortuni*  
Va be', esistono dei partiti contrari?  
*Legge sulla parit√† di genere nelle retribuzioni*  
Sarebbe dannosa (mi riservo di spiegare oltre previa richiesta).
3. *Investire sulle nuove genereazioni, blablabla*  
Altre ovviet√†
4. *Protezione dei diritti umani, rimuovere le forme di diseguaglianza*  
Ah, quindi lo facciamo 'sto matrimonio per le coppie omosessuali, s√¨? Cos√¨ riduciamo anche la burocrazia, rendendo inutile l'unione civile.  
*Sostegno disabili e famiglie numerose.*  
Va bene. Basta che trovatre i soldi.
5. *Ambiente, investimenti in tecnologie pulite*  
Benissimo, ma dico sul serio, √® giusto che se ne parli. Certo, mi piacerebbe vedere qualche proposta concreta, che ne so, pi√π colonnine per le auto elettriche e incentivi economici per il loro acquisto?
6. *Frane, alluvioni, terremoti*  
E d'accordo. Cosa vogliamo fare a riguardo, oltre a dire che vogliamo fare qualcosa?
7. *Pi√π ricerca*  
Gi√† detto nel punto 1. Benissimo, i soldi dove li prendiamo? Dalle pensioni, vero?
8. *Investimenti in ammodernamento infrastrutture e nuove infrastrutture, sistema pi√π connesso blablabla*  
Turbofuffa senza forma.
9. *Eccessiva rigidit√† dei vincoli europei, pi√π crescita e non solo stabilit√†, Europa pi√π solidale e inclusiva*  
Ahhhh, quindi vogliamo prendere i soldi facendo pi√π debito, non tagliando le spese. Tutto chiaro.  
Solidale e inclusiva? Ok, benissimo, come costringiamo gli altri paesi EU (tipo il V4) a prendersi qualche migrante, per esempio?
10. *Taglio dei parlamentari, ma assicurando rappresentanza democratica e pluralismo politico e territoriale.*  
Delle due, l'una. Ma almeno la richiesta √® chiara.
11. *Legge contro il conflitto di interessi e riforma della RAI.*  
Ok, un altro punto chiaro. E sono pure d'accordo.
12. *Ridurre i tempi della giustizia*  
Sono d'accordo. Come? Quanto? Dove ""tagliamo""?  
*Cambiare il metodo di elezione del CSM.*  
Perch√©? E come?
13. *Lotta alle mafie*  
Ok. Come? Parlano (quasi) *tutti* di lotta alle mafie, ma come la volete fare?
*Inasprimento pene per grandi evasori.*
D'accordissimo.
14. *Meno tasse, meno spese inutili*  
Tutto molto bello, **ma come‚ÄΩ** Perch√© ridurre gli sprechi in PA richiederebbe prima degli investimenti (per l'informatizzazione del sistema e l'educazione dei dipendenti pubblici) oppure l'eliminazione delle provincie. Ma soprattutto, ridurre la spesa pubblica significa soprattutto ridurre i dipendenti. Che per me va bene, ma 'sta gente dove la mandiamo?
15. *Decreto sicurezza non si tocca se non per quel che ha detto il PdR, l'Euroa deve intervenire per bloccare i traffici illegali*  
Buona fortuna. Come cazzo le fermi delle fottute persone in mare? Corridoi umanitari? Intervento militare in Libia? Affondiamo i barconi?
16. *Investimenti per il sud, banca pubblica per gli investimenti*
Ok, con quali soldi?
17. *Autonomie*  
Ok, quindi i soldi per il Sud da dove li prendiamo?  
*Sopprimere enti locali inutili*  
Benissimo. E la gente che lavora in questi enti dove la mandiamo?
18. *Tutela dei risparmiatori*  
Ok. Come? Servono soldi?
19. *Tutelare scuola, acqua e sanit√†, concessioni autostradali*.  
Quindi dalla sanit√† e dall'istruzione non si fanno tagli, meno male. Tagliamo le pensioni, giusto?
20. *Cittadinanza digitale e diritto di accesso alla rete*  
Nulla da eccepire. Anche se il ""diritto di accesso alla rete"" √® difficile da tutelare senza **spendere soldi**.
21. *Digitalizzazione della PA*  
Ottimo, cos√¨ servono meno dipendenti. Dove li mandiamo quelli attuali?
22. *Fuffa varia, diritti dei riders, web tax*  
E tuteliamoli 'sti *riders*, sono d'accordissimo.  
Quello che mi preoccupa √® la *web tax*. Perch√© o la si fa a livello europeo, oppure semplicemente si smetter√† di cercare profitto in Italia.
23. *Pi√π soldi in difesa, forze dell'ordine e vigili del fuoco*.  
Ok, con quali soldi? Tagliamo le pensioni?
24. *Valorizziamo il turismo*  
Ma va?
25. *Rafforzare l'export e valorizzare il made in Italy*  
Ma va? Ma poi abbiamo problemi a riguardo?
26. *Migliorare Roma.*

&gt;**Who are the Aztec?**

&gt;[""Aztec"" is a bit of a nebulous term. The Aztec Empire was an alliance of 3 city-states: Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan, who joined forces to overthrow the former most powerful city-state/political captial (Azcapotzalco) in the valley they were located in after a successon dispute resulted in the assassination of both one of Azacapotzalco's heirs, as well as the then-king of Tenochtitlan by the other heir of Azcapotzalco.](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9dgzj4/is_this_true_when_the_spaniards_first_arrived_in/e5jjm16/?st=jxank7na&amp;sh=47258627) After overthrowing Azcapotzalco, the 3 cities agreed to continue to work together for further conquests, [and proceeded to militrasitically expand all across Mexico from coast to coast over the next century or so](https://youtu.be/8a8SkSYtHXo?t=828)., By the time the Spanish arriving, controlling a huge chunk of the world as they knew it, with the next largest political state, the Purepecha Empire, only being 1/3 their size

&gt;Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, Tlacopan., Azacapotzalco, and most of the other cities and towns in their valley and the adjacent lands to it in Central Mexico all were composed of various ethnic subgroups belonging to the larger Nahua culture. Tenochtitlan, which was effectively ([or perhaps formally](https://np.reddit.com/r/mesoamerica/comments/63n1az/the_triple_alliance_never_existed_meet_the/?st=jxaqgbuq&amp;sh=3fd51956)) the Aztec captial, and it's ihanbiytates speffically belonged to the Nahua subgroup known as the Mexica. While due to sharing a culture, the Mexica and other Nahua subgroups like the Acolhua, Tepenanca, Xochimilca, etc had a lot of similarities (and indeed, there were a fair amount of pan-mesoamerican cultural trends between say the Nahua, Mixtec, Maya, etc too), there were still differences, with the Mexica for example being the ones who even by the standards of other Nahua groups and Mesoamerican cultures, preformed a lot of human sacrifices (though still less then popular culture makes it out to be: Think hundreds, not tens of thousands of sacrifices per year, and most of these would be enemy soldiers who were jusat captured to sacrifice later rather then killed in battle) 

&gt;""Aztec"", as a term, variously can mean ""The Aztec Triple Alliance"" of Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan, the entire empire (ie Those plus the cities they conquered in their military expansions; though note that contrary to the popular perception of the Aztec as a violennt, oppressive imperial machine, the ruling cities did not directly govern the cities they conquered, and left them to keep their own rulers, laws, and culture without interference, provided they paid their taxes of economic goods, helped on military campaigns, etc), the Nahuas in general, or just the Mexica speffically

&gt;For the purposes of this post, I will be primarily talking about the Mexica, and while some of this will apply to other cultures, especially other Nahua groups, they, especially other cultures, to some extent had their own clothing hairstyle, and beauty norms. I recommend checking out Kamazotz on Deviantart (@Zotzcomic on twitter)'s work to see some examples of the different attire and fashion (including hairstyles) of different Mesoamerican cultures.

&gt;**Aztec civillian attire** 

&gt;The everyday, commoner male Aztec citizen would be basically naked with loincloths and not much else, but plenty of others would be wearing clothing of various degrees of ornateness. [Most men would be wearing a mantle, called a Tilma, sort of like a greco-roman toga, with the way it was worn/wrapped around differing based on social class](http://www.mexicolore.co.uk/images-aus/aus_27_03_2.jpg), while women would be wearing various types of skirts and blouses, in fact this being one of a few elements of traditional Nahua culture still present in Mexico today, as [Huipil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huipil). A triangular collar garment known as the Quechquemitl (seen [here on the left](https://i.imgur.com/DALn8ix.jpg)) was also worn by women (like the Huipil, this is also still worn by communities in mexico today) Finer mantles, Quechquemitl, and Huipil worn by upper classes would be made of cottonand be extremely ornate in the patterns and colors used  (lower quality/class ones of Maguey, with plainer designs), and jewerly such as lip plugs, earings, nose rings, necklaces, armabds, legbands, and braclets made of gold, silver, jade, obsidian, and often ornamented with fine feathers such as from Quetzals or hummingbirds were used

&gt;For some visual examples, [this](https://i.imgur.com/s6ovPfG.jpg) and [this](https://i.imgur.com/j6mopjk.jpg) page of the excellent ongoing, free Aztec empire comic by  Paul Guinan and illustrated by David Hahn which is probably the most historically accurate telling of the Aztec-Spanish war/conquest; shows a scene in an Aztec palace and in the city's streets with some examples of people in varying clothing, and there's a huge variety of Aztec (both of Mexica and other Nahua groups) clothing [here](https://i.imgur.com/3WNdurh.jpg): On the left-top and left middle, you can see commoner and noble people in civillian attire.  The 3 guys in black paint in the middle row, towards the left and the middle are all priests, and the 3 people decked out in fancy bling between them are royalty (or at least very high nobility) though it's worth noting the that huge headdress wasn't actually worn by royalty, but was a luxary, ceremonial item gift given to Cortes's men that's erroneously known as montezuma's headdress, so it's use here is an error. Actual Nahua ""crowns"" were [triangular diadems, usually of mosaic turquoise](http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/aztecs/moctezuma-1.jpg) The right of the middle row and the whole bottom row shows soldiers of various rank in war uniforms. I didn't mention the top right, but I'll get back to that further down. 

&gt;**Aztec military attire** 

&gt;Junior soldiers still in training, porters, and soldiers who had not captured any enemy combatants would be fighting naked with just a breechcloth, but soldiers of decent rank, such as by capturing an enemy in battle (I've also seen it claimed only nobles who reached this rank would be wearing cloth armor, but I'm not sure on this, might be commoners still too) sort of like european gambeson, called [Ichcahuipilli](https://i.imgur.com/dLIZsYP.png), worn as either vests, tunics, or suits, alongside shields made of reed, cloth, wood, and sometimes with feather mosiac coverings (basically, thousands of feathers arranged to make patterns based on the colors of the feathers; [this same technique was used in the coliomnal period to make ""paintings"" out of feathers](https://i.imgur.com/qshK5or.jpg) ) and metal ornamentation. [Elite warriors would also be wearing suits made of cloth and covered in overlapping feathers called Tlahuitzli,with the feathers mosiacs forming specific patterns and shapes based on their color](https://i.imgur.com/riliqkD.png), and with accompanying helmets made of wood, though commoners who entered elite military orders, such as the Jaguar order, via merit might have actual animal skins instead of feather suits. Particularly elite commanding officiers, royalty, etc might be wearing more ornate outfits[ called Ehuatl, which were specifically tunic forms of tlahuitzli](https://i.imgur.com/X66TW7F.jpg) [with a skirt made of feathers or leather straps, armbands, legbands, and sometimes helmets](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Nezahualcoyotl.jpg).

&gt;For more information, check out this video on [Aztec rank system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcD5nDnVkEs), I helped work on; we should be doing more as well.

&gt;If you look at that image I linked at the end of the civillian attire section, you can see various examples of soldiers in Ichcahuipilli, Tlahuitzli, etc, as well as on the top right, some soldiers from Non-mexica and even non-Nahua cultures such as the Purepecha with entirely different clothing/military equipment norms.

I'll eventually make an expanded, updated version of this as well (I plan on submitting it ton /r/pics in the next few days with an accruate image since another post got popular there;+ to imgur) as I omitted some stuff (men also had some civillian tunic garments, for example) and want to go into more detail

[],,Cleles,1482580318.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_13tmin,False,False,[],"Simply put ‚Äì farmers are not being paid enough for their produce.

In 1983 they were getting 40% for every Punt spent, while today they are getting just 21% from every Euro. For comparison the processors share also fell from 30% to 28%, but the retailers rose from 30% to 51%.

The reasons why how this disparity came to be require a lot more explaining than this single comment, but it boils down to a combination of the following:

1) Absolutely inept governance by the department. The EEC made the decision to subsidise food production to ensure high-quality low cost food for all within the block (whether you think this is good or bad is a different matter). But all that has happened is that the EU is now subsidising the retailers by proxy. That such a situation came to be rests a lot with the department and Galway-tent politics.

2) Huge disparity in negotiating power between individual farmers and larger factories, as well as between individual factories and large retailers. I could tell stories about how Tesco were buying produce (not beef) and had a strategy of becoming the largest purchaser for small producers, and then just dictating a lower price knowing that it would bankrupt the producer to lose what was most of their current business.

3) 5th quarter cuts. When the prices for selling cattle to the factories was set there was more wastage. Today a lot of the wastage can be sold on (eg: for glue, dog food, etc.), but the farmers get no share of that.

4) Farmers couldn‚Äôt agree on the colour of shoite, and this disunity has led to them being ineffective as a negotiating force (and were thus taken advantage of). The IFA has been useless, and when they have done more as a reseller for FBD than securing conditions for farmers you know they have failed.

5) Economics of scale, but this would require way too much explanation. Basically, the higher volumes are processed the more efficiently it can be done. In some cases to achieve this volume processors agreed to supply at very cheap prices to retailers, which helped the processor but not the farmer.

6) Rigid requirements on what bonuses are paid to farmers. Retailers can demand anything due to their overwhelming economic power (eg: 30 month animals), but these requirements end up screwing the farmer.

7) Bord Bia is acting as a representative body for the retailers. In the last talks their instance that all retailers required under 30 months turned out to be bollocks when Lidl/Supermacs put on record they‚Äôll take animals up to 36 months. Like WTF!???

Sadly, targeting the processors (as the farmers have done) won‚Äôt achieve anything because, frankly, they‚Äôre not the party with the lion‚Äôs share of the profit. Any action that doesn‚Äôt hit the retailers won‚Äôt bring retailers to the table ‚Äì and without retailers any talks are a waste of time. The retailers will sit back and watch processors go bust before they‚Äôll do anything. If a customer enters a store to buy a steak and there are none then the customer will simply buy something else. So the retailers aren‚Äôt losing out in all of this.

My advice to the famers is to target the central warehouses for Tesco, Musgraves, etc. If they don‚Äôt make the retailer face pain they can‚Äôt bring those retailers to the negotiating table. IMHO I think the famers have every right to go apeshit. This current action is 10-15 years in the making, and they are entitled to a slice of the pie they did most of the work making. The money you and I are paying for beef is enough for everybody in the chain to make a decent living, the industry is long overdue a correction. Just wish they‚Äôd target the actual culprits.

Another point I want to make. A large reason cited to call off the protests is because of the Chinese inspections. Opening up the China would be a boon to the industry according to the protests‚Äô detractors. The question I want some journalist to ask MMI, Creed, etc. is this ‚Äì why should the famers facilitate the Chinese inspections when the outcome of such won‚Äôt see any farmer get a single red cent out of it???? The Chinese deal will bring in lots of money, absolutely. But what‚Äôs the fucking point if the famers are going to get jack shit out it???

Not that I advocate violence, but the Kennedy quote of ‚Äú*Those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable*‚Äù springs to mind. People who are desperate and have nothing else to lose are dangerous.

It is absolutely wrong to consider fascism as the ideology of genocide of the Jewish people. At the beginning the fascist regime in Italy was sharply anti-anti-Semitic. It is not because Mussolini allegedly loved Jews or was afraid of something. Mussolini has always said that he does not accept the racial definition of a nation forming a state. Mussolini was not only not an anti-Semite, but also sharply criticized the fundamental postulates of Nazism - racial theory and state anti-Semitism. He divided people into ""citizens"" and ""non-citizens"" of his state. The proof is that from the early 1919 ""s until 1938 Jews formed a large part of the Italian fascist party. In those years Mussolini received the support not only of Rome 's chief rabbi, but also of a large part of the Italian Jewish community, as well as of the world Jewish community.

""We make no distinction between Jews and non-Jews in any sphere of life, in religion, in politics, in economics, in the army... Our Jews found themselves a new Zion here on our beautiful land, which each of them is willing to heroically defend to the last drop of blood. "" Benito Mussolini in an article in the central organ of the fascist party ""Il Popolo d 'Italia"" (""The Italian People"") in 1920,

Jews were among his close and associates. Mussolini 's mistresses did not hide their Jewry. One of them, Margarita Sarfati was more than a mistress, she was one of the main planners of the march to Rome, wrote for Mussolini articles and his official biography, participated in the creation of a special artistic style ""Novocento,"" symbolizing the new fascist Italy. Many Italian generals and admirals, members of the Supreme Fascist Council, leading intellectuals and theorists of Italian fascism did not hide their Jewry. The Italian Jewish community was the most assimilated and rooted in the life of the country from all European Jewish communities.

Mussolini had a very good relationship with the Jewish isz√≥w in Erez Israel. In the late 1920s, Mussolini was going to name a chair at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. The Israeli war fleet began with the assistance of the Italians in 1930. Heads of Ishuva organizations constantly and with pleasure went to Mussolini. It wasn 't just right-wing Zionist figures who traveled. The future President of Israel, Haim Weizman, returned to Mussolini from Italy. Mussolini did not hesitate to publicly call anti-Semitism a ""German disease,"" by analogy: syphilis - called ""French disease.""

When Mussolini, under harsh pressure from the Germans, did pass anti-Jewish laws in the late 37, he passed them in such an editorial that they to the fury of the Nazis did not really work. Mussolini stipulated in the law that they did not apply to many categories of Jews: war veterans, Jews awarded higher orders and medals, members of the fascist party and fascist organizations, including choral societies and consumer cooperation, and so on and the like. He even added this category to the exception: former members of the fascist party along with their parents, grandparents, their wives, children and grandchildren. As a result, the vast majority of Italian Jews became legally protected from racial laws. It is unlikely that a Jewish family could be found in Italy in which at least one member of a family that was not a member of a fascist party or fascist organization. Convinced Italian anti-Semites called these laws a mockery of the Nazi idea. The head, created under the law of the Italian anti-Semitic movement, Roberto Farinacci defiantly took himself into the secretaries of the Jew.

There was nothing like a system of death camps in fascist Italy. No Jews, in any country under Italian control, were handed over to Germany until 1943. In 1943, Italy was captured by the Nazis of Germany, who engaged in the destruction of Jews.

By the way, the fascist leader of Spain, Francis Franco, serves to prove that Mussolini 's non-extradition of Jews was based on fascist ideology. Franco, who is considered a typical ""fascist dictator,"" also refused to hand over Spanish Jews to the Nazis on Hitler 's orders and saved tens of thousands of Jews from extermination. It was Franco who signed the document abolishing the decree issued in 1492 on the expulsion of Jews from Spain. Meanwhile, the ""liberal"" French and Dutch, like all liberal Europe, were readily and enthusiastically involved in the Nazi program of deporting Jews to death camps.",True,False,False,,,0,1567504305,,False,0,{},eyvo3tz,False,t3_cyywku,False,True,t3_cyywku,/r/worldpolitics/comments/cyywku/italian_politician_lists_antisemitic_as_his/eyvo3tz/,False,,1576011177,1,True,[],False,worldpolitics,t5_2qh9a,r/worldpolitics,public,0,

I personally have voted more than 10 times on constitutional changes and I have worked on some referendum campaigns.

It's simple, the government are elected with a mandate from the electorate on what issues are important...they propose constitutional amendments...people go to the polls after public information campaigns and tv debates...and if more than 50% vote in favour of amendment then the constitution is updated, if not it remains as-is.

As an EU-member state, this is also a mechanism for checking on the powers and influence of the EU. If there's a new EU treaty proposed, Ireland can't sign up without it going to the people to accept the terms of the treaty in the constitution and we have blocked Europe a number of times through this mechanism of the people having the voice. Through this we can go back and negotiate for reassurances based on the concerns of the population.

So to see a country with basically the same set-up, and a much older constitution go through this process of having loads of amendments early on and very few since - overall less amendments than Ireland in a much longer timespan - without going to the people to vote each time and essesstially create this impression that it is completely sacrosanct is just bizarre.

Oil etc. All these countries, Muslims countries as well have gotten involved because of agendas and political benefit. Im not defending Muslim countries only so you know. I would stand against anyone who is evil. Just so you know where i stand.

You only have 1 image of Islam, an image you've been given. The extremism that you see and blame on Islam comes from Saudi Arabia. You will say but that is the main land Islam came from... That extremism is due to wahabism. The strictest version of Islam which only came into existence after 1900s, after whose request? Americas. Im not lying. Seriously, do the research, the clown prince bin Salman admitted on Live TV. It came into play as they wanted to fight the soviets in Afghanistan....  

You do realise that the science of today. The medicine and science of today is based on the Islamic golden age. Search it up. Western authers  have even wrote about it. How European scienctists travelled to the middle east  because of science that was well before its time. You will say what about now. Just search the house of wisdom, a education centre based in Iraq. The only reason knowledge ceased in the middle east is because of the Mongolian invasion of Baghdad and destruction of so many education centres and libraries. 

Do you know the first womans university was created in the 8th century? by a Muslim. 

Make sense of this? America invaded Iraq and Afghanistan after 9/11 an incident where all the perpetrators were of Saudi Arabian citizenship, and no connection to Afghanistan or Iraq. America has 1000 military bases around the world. America has been found to have participated in over 30 political assassinations. If you want to address atrocities or Evil, help me challenge them. Speak with Muslims. You will find yourself less biased. 

Theres a lot of evil in the world and it aint because of Islam. If you had an honest heart, you will know that. Isis is a product of a form of Islam that was requested by the West to drag Muslims into fighting the Soviets for their gain. Their own agenda. It backfired when these armed groups saw them as the enemy as well.

This, arguably, is the main difference between them and PSOE. 

In economics their program is basically post-keynesian. They experience, as any other such movement, the difficulties in implementing structural measures of the kind in the CEE - states are forced to get investment in secondary markets. And they face all the de facto difficulties in regulating finances.

PSOE is much more acquainted with these difficulties, and is much more willing to appeal to market strategies to make structural changes.

I would say that ideologically by now there are no other major differences respective to PSOE represented inside the party: though politics is a doing word :-)

In Andaluc√≠a you will find an anticapitalist movement Adelante Andaluc√≠a, once organically dependent on Podemos, and about to become an independent party: 'confluencias'. They were issued originally from the anticapitalist movement. And they may be more inclined to consider other sort of ways of implementing structural measures - maybe **structuring measures** , meaning collective changes implemented bottom-up.

5 years ago there were many more ideological options inside Podemos that were taken away organically from the party: some think that the party should 're-invent' itself https://www.eldiario.es/politica/Ramon-Espinar-consejo-ciudadano-Podemos_0_905709740.html - a part of those are in Andalucia.

You will find more information in www.podemos.info , including detailed information on the program and the C√≠rculos - meeting points for anyone interested in Podemos; and a proprietary blog - this one is the one where everything started.

Palestinians are Arabs dude. They don't magically turn Arab over time. It's well documented that almost all are descended from Arabs who arrived as Ottoman settler colonials after 1886. All you have to do is look at the Census numbers.

But tell me, if Arabs were there, say 2000 years ago, why did the Romans only take Jews as slaves to Europe? Why is there no mention of any Arabs except Nabateans and Edomites?  Plus the DNA is conclusive - Jews indigenous to the Levant. Arabs not.

Anyway I can't waste time on you. I've blocked you too many times for your blatant lying and anti science lying.

&gt; Um, the Jews didn't show up until after the Philistines (ancestors of the Palestinians) and you would not recognize the religion until about 500 BC, then there is the fact that most Israeli Jews have little or no Semitic ancestry, being descendants of foreign converts to Judaism.

Oh really? Bc Abbas just said the Palestinians are descended from Canaanites. Previously they've claimed the Jebusites and everyone listed in the bible. The Philistines were ethnic Greeks and have zero connection to the Palestinians of today.

You're also lying about the Jews, who are directly referred to as early as 800BC and whose artefacts dating even further back have been found.

All you have are lies. It's really disgusting.

&gt; That's why there is documented evidence of them going back over 3,000 years?

AGAIN, then show it to me. Show me a cite. Why didn't you just name the Palestinian king or show a coin or an artifact or anything? The fact is that there is an abundance of various types of evidence of Jews having been there for 3,500 years and there is zero evidence of Arab Palestinians ever being there before the Muslim conquest. Not only that, but the Arabs arrival there much later IS well documented.

You're just a lying, uneducated, unread scumbag.

Also please explain why the Arab Palestinians were calling themselves southern Syrians long before they ever called themselves "" Palestinians"".

The fact of the matter is that it is extremely hard to see how the UK can contribute anything meaningful to the EU any more if it should elect to stay in. I do not share the author's opinion there but I will be the first to admit that my preference for the UK staying in is purely based on emotional arguments (e. g. several of my friends are British, some reside over here and none of them deserve to be harmed by this shambles). I cannot, in good conscience, make a factual case for why we would be better of with the UK in rather than out. The only argument I can find at this point is that if the UK revokes the article 50 invocation then we would be legally obliged to allow it to stay in because the EU Court of Justice said so.

And what of the other options ? Should the EU have caved on the four freedoms, on special access to the single market, on the backstop ? IMHO, the answer is no, and I have yet to speak to someone that has a different opinion. The hard cold fact is that the EU's positions (no special privileges, no prioritizing the UK over a fellow member state and certainly no meddling with the single market) have very high public support. And that is *because they are logical and consistent*. You don't leave a club and get to keep the perks. And when the EU uses its full political and diplomatic weight to pressure the UK on the Irish border issue, it is not punishing the UK. It is doing its job. That's what it is for: to defend the interests of its members. People in the UK should realize that if this whole shambles leads to traffic jams at the borders, chaos in the harbours and airports and political unrest (or even violence) in Northern Ireland, that people in the EU will put the blame squarely on the UK government. Suffice to say that this (and the obvious future altercations that it will cause) will make the UK government even less popular over here than it currently is.

So what's left ? Where do we move from here? If the UK exits without a deal then we enter a long period of confrontational, if not outright dysfunctional relationships between the UK and **all** its neighbours. If it exits with a deal, we will go on to the next stage of the negotiations, but as far I can see, the UK political class will have learned nothing and will have forgotten nothing. The same game will be played, with mostly the same result: a negotiation that is more a domestic PR campaign than a serious attempt at building a trade deal. A trade deal that will, invariably, disappoint because it will not (can not) be better than what the UK already had.

Either way, after Brexit, we'll be looking at decades of arguing, impotent rage and inflammatory rhetoric.

A very solid window but the high expectations and propaganda built around this particular transfer window, made it not enough.

The board and the sporting director tried to rub off the Liverpool early elimination and more importantly the shameful performances by promising this summer Bayern are ready to spend 200 million Euros, but now I can say bad luck and mismanagement ruined it.

Pavard- 7: A good player with international glory and covers depth by being able to play both CB and RB at a very good level. Questions were asked about his abilities due to some poor performances last season.

Lucas Hernandez- 9: The missing piece at Bayern's defense (hopefully). Adds pace, aggression and high quality defending. Such things were missed during the last seasons. His parternship with Niklas Sule has the potential to be one of Europe's finest.

Jan Fiette Arp- 5: I don't have much to say about him. Good young player but has a lot to prove and a big mountain to climb at FC Bayern.

Ivan Perisic- 7: Unfortunate for him that he was announced after the Sane saga. People reacted negatively to him due to his age. He isn't the top notch quality of a winger, but he is a very solid squad player with high experience and he is a good player. Won't be surprised if this guy gives a monester performance for Bayern. He looks determined to prove people wrong.

Micheal Cuisance- 6: He has potential but his problem that he is set to compete with some fine players at such a stacked midfield. I don't see him getting an XI spot over the likes of Goretzka or Tolisso not mentioning Thiago or Muller or Philippe Coutinho. I ses this as Renato Sanches V2 and in two years he will ask for leaving. If he can be happy being a squad player. He is a great signing.

Philippe Coutinho- 9: With acknowledging he isn't the same player that left Liverpool - yet - he looks determined and is trying his best to integrate himself in the team and in the city. If he regains his Liverpool form especially for the big games of the Champions League, he can be the type of player that Bayern missed for the last 5-6 years especially after the injuries and decline of Robbery.

[From an RT√â article a couple weeks ago:](https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2019/0816/1069117-what-is-the-public-services-card/)
&gt; The [European Data Protection] commission said it found that processing of personal data by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection for the issuing of public services cards for the purpose of identifying a person claiming a benefit, is legal under data protection law - remember that's the original reason the card was set up.

&gt;But when it comes to the department's processing of personal data during the issuing of a Public Services Card for its use in transactions between the holder and a public body other than the department itself, well that is illegal.

&gt;The commission also found that the department's blanket and indefinite retention of documents and information provided by people applying for a Public Services Card contravenes data protection law.

 &gt;And it ruled that the scheme does not comply with the transparency requirements of the data protection acts, because the information given by the department to the public about the processing of their personal data in connection with the issuing of the cards was not adequate.

So, the department failed in 3 particular ways:

It was processing data that it had for other bodies, which is illegal under GDPR. Not doing this lowers the actual usefulness of the PSC, so this part could be seen as a bit strict.

It was planning to hold onto this information indefinitely when the subject of that data has no intention of contacting or using public services, or their card may have lapsed. Very illegal under GDPR, no interpretation around this one.

A lack of transparency in the processing of the data that people were handing in. This is the vaguest one, but there's no reason at all to hold this back.

&gt;Is that a widespread view?

I cant speak for all of the EU :). It certainly was not a widespread view 3 years ago, almost no one wanted you to vote leave; the Uk, despite being eurosceptic, actually contributed a great deal. It may not even have been a popular view 1 year ago. But right now, especially with your current PM, I strongly suspect it is.

And here is why; even if you revoked article 50, there is no way for the EU to move forward with the UK being held hostage by the fear of the brexit party, brexiters blaming the EU for everything, and while yielding  veto power over treaty changes and a non trivial amount of influence in the commission and parliament. More over, brexiters arent going anywhere, and its only a matter of time before the next british PM triggers article 50 again. Might as well get it over with now.

Im not even 100% convinced the EU will grant the UK another extension. I think its likely, as it could prevent a disorderly brexit which frankly no one benefits from, but Im not even 100% sure. Read [article 4](https://www.consilium.europa.eu//media/38744/21-euco-art50-conclusions-en.pdf?utm_source=dsms-auto&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=European+Council+(Art.+50)+conclusions%2c+21+March+2019) of the last extension we granted. If there is another extension I would expect strings will be attached, like requiring a binding referendum on the WA or something else to prevent this being yet another pointless extension that kicks the can down the road, but still leads to a cliff edge.

&gt;many would not see it as reasonable precisely for the reason you stated, that it is not really a deal but a time extension

Whats unreasonable about providing a period to negotiate without economic calamity (and border issues in NI) ? Anyone who thinks a no deal brexit is the end of negotiations is just deluding themselves. There are **thousands** of issues to work out, agreements we need to make. From settled status rights to animal passports and nuclear waste to access to airspace and fishing. Replicating, undoing and renegotiating 50 years of integration is going to take many, may years.  Leaving the EU is actually far more difficult than joining it, when you join its clear what the rules and conditions will be, and you dont get to pick which ones you like and which you dont. Disentangling especially when the UK doesnt really seem to know what it wants to retain, is going to be far harder. You can either do that while retaining viable trade ties and cooperation during that process, which is what the WA provides, or while under a self imposed embargo.

Its hard to find treaties on a regions that were squashed under a country for hundreds of years where people were denied their autonomy.

There is nothing obliging the EU to grant it, but indications are that they are inclined to, simply so that the blame for this drive towards no deal is placed precisely where it belongs - at the feet of Boris Johnson.  After that extension is secured, what will most likely happen is a General Election will be called, either by a Vote of No Confidence or by the government itself.  Then, if the government get ousted and Labour get into power, we will most likely end up revoking Article 50, possibly with a referendum first.  If BoJo gets back in, though, no deal is back on the table and will still likely happen.

However, there are some possible issues with this:

1)  There have been indications that BoJo may try to game the system by calling for a snap election, try to get Parliament to support it by setting the date for mid October - then shift the date to October 31st.  This could possibly be countered by specifics within the anti-no deal bill, and some things said by Labour seem to indicate they are wise to this, so they may oppose any election set before October 31st unless an extension has already been secured.

2)  There have been indications that the government [may simply not follow the legislation passed](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-49542522/brexit-gove-refuses-to-confirm-government-will-abide-by-no-deal-law).

Who stands the most to profit from a splintered EU/NATO/US? China. They know that what they are doing (spreading their authoritarian ideology, building Muslim KZs, threatening to take over Taiwan/HK, expanding in Africa) is not going to be taken lightly by everyone else... but they themselves don't have the spionage and other networks, so China turned to the (very experienced but broke) Russians, who then went on and managed to install a Russian puppet as fucking head of US government - so, no opposition from the US, no matter what atrocities China commits. Greece and Italy are beyond their ears in debt, so China bought themselves into important assets like ports - no opposition to expect from there and ""thanks"" to the 100% consensus rule in major EU decision, actually two veto countries.

It was only compounded when if you look at the voters map. Technically more people voted remain, but due to how the voting is weighted (yay democracy), the brexiteers got their way. 

My only issue with that is very few who voted leave did it for reasons beyond ""hurr durr immigrunts r bad and dey tek my benefits"". The media span a story and all the brainless sheep masses ate it all up. These same people are the ones complaining about how messed up the situation is, but the way I explain it is simple;

The UK was a founding member of the EU, and as such held a position of prominence, which of course came with its own prerogatives. We form part of the most deeply rooted center of the EU, and to untangle all these agreements, deals and all sort from these roots is like trying to untangle your earphones using 2bricks for hands, its going to be handled rough and brutal, and your earphones could probably break in the process anyway.

When our main shopping center in the city was hit by a terrorist attack, it was the EU who footed most the bill to rebuild the Arndale. The south of Manchester is dedicated to such a large population of students that are not only national and European, but global. These students do their studies here, finish their degrees, and yes some go back to their respective countries, but others remain to start their lives here, adding to our local economy. Hell I know a guy who used to run a small takeout food place in the heart of the student residence areas, and he would always tell me how during summertime he would only open around 6-7pm because all the students are away for the holidays, and the only ones who stayed are here to party and be up late.

It may have some truth but it's definitly not widely accepted and I can show you why. It simply contain errors in fact and logic that I'll try to explain with your comment.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; A lighter skin would make absorbation of vitamin D from sunlight easier,  but that extra vitamin D was needed due to a change in diet going from  hunter-gatherer to sedentary agriculturalist. 

Having less sun also makes the extra vitamin D needed. This statement alone is no reason to rule out ""less sun"" as a reason.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;New scientific findings show that prehistoric European hunter-gatherers  were rather dark-skinned (and this applies also to prehistoric  Scandinavian hunter-gatherers). It seems that they did not need  additional vitamin D from sunlight, because they had enough vitamin D  from food - being hunters and gatherers, they were eating a lot of  vitamin D-rich meat, fish, mushrooms and fruits. Only with the switch to  agriculture several thousand years ago, amount of vitamin D-rich food  in diet decreased - and as the result evolution of very pale skin tone  among Europeans started. 

That makes sense so far (which doesn't mean that it must be true).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Debunking the theory that lighter skin gradually arose in Europeans  nearly 40,000 years ago, new research has revealed that it started  evolving much recently - only 7,000 years ago.  

40,000 years ago is not the current theory, more like 6,000 to 15,000 or 20,000 years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Instead, ""what seems likely, then, is that the dietary changes  accompanying the so-called Neolithic revolution, or the transition from  food collection to food production, might have caused, **or contributed** to  cause, this change,"" Barbujani said. 

Just wanting to point that out. This is not hard fact, these are hypotheses.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In the food-production theory, the cereal-rich diet of Neolithic farmers  lacked vitamin D, so Europeans rapidly lost their dark-skin  pigmentation only once they switched to agriculture, because it was only  at that point that they had to synthesize vitamin D from the sun more  readily. 

And now we come to the main point why the diet hypothesis is lacking. Farming came from the south east into Europe, while light skin is thought to come from the north because of archaeological findings. How does that make sense?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; ""Most people of the world make most of their vitamin D in their skin as a  result UV exposure. But at northern latitudes and with dark skin, this  would have been less efficient. ~~If people weren't getting much vitamin D  in their diet, then~~ having lighter skin may have been the best option."" 

Makes just as much sense if not more if you strike that part out. He even says himself that most vitamin D is from UV exposure.

I recently spent a month traveling mostly solo in Korea. By solo, I really mean mostly solo. Besides the few tourist friendly towns of Seoul and Busan...maybe a few others, MOST do not even have hostels. So anyways, I made it to Busan around day 15 or so and stayed at one of the oldest hostels in the city. I should add that I have lived in Korea for close to a decade, so it is not like I am looking at it from a newbies point of view.   

Anyways, in Busan, the owner launched her hostel in 2002 after traveling in Europe and liking the idea of hostels. It worked at first, and for the most part, foreigners have stayed there along with a few Koreans who are curious. However, in the last year or two, she said things have kind of changed. Locals who travel within the country often ask if they are a ""party hostel"" or if they host parties/BBQs as an organized event. When she says no, they just go elsewhere.   

Weirdly enough, such a request in other countries, say Thailand, is usually a sign that it will be full of foreigners. In Korea however, Koreans tend to need that forced social gathering to feel capable of interacting with strangers. Korean society is just not like western society where you just talk to strangers normally (I am generalizing but bare with me,

Ok.

&gt; L'esposizione del crocifisso nelle aule scolastiche italiane √® stato argomento dibattutto nella storia d'Italia. Ad oggi √® previsto dall'art. 118 del Regio decreto 30 aprile 1924, n. 965. e dal Regio decreto 26 aprile 1928, n. 1297. Entrambe le disposizioni sono relative agli elementi di arredo delle aule scolastiche e di altri ambienti pubblici e **devono ritenersi ancora in vigore in quanto non abrogate**.

&gt; I tribunali civili per√≤ si son detti non competenti a giudicare in materia: poich√© le indicazioni del ministero non sono vere e proprie leggi civili, ma provvedimenti amministrativi interni alla scuola, la competenza spetta ai vari TAR. **Il Consiglio di Stato, di grado superiore ai vari TAR nazionali e supremo organo di consulenza amministrativa, si √® pronunciato a favore della presenza del crocifisso nelle aule scolastiche** con un parere del 1988 e uno del 2006

&gt; La Corte europea per i diritti dell'uomo il 3 novembre 2009[3] con la sentenza Lautsi v. Italia stabil√¨ in 1¬∫ grado di giudizio che il crocifisso nelle aule √® ""una violazione del diritto dei genitori a educare i figli secondo le loro convinzioni e del diritto degli alunni alla libert√† di religione"", imponendo all'Italia un risarcimento di 5.000 euro per danni morali. **Tale sentenza √® stata poi ribaltata in 2¬∫ grado il 18 marzo 2011, quando la Grand Chambre, con 15 voti a favore e due contrari, ha assolto l'Italia** accettando la tesi in base alla quale non sussistono elementi che provino l'eventuale influenza sugli alunni dell'esposizione del crocifisso nelle aule scolastiche.

Rispettiamo le regole quindi.
