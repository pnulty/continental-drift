(therefore I'm not an expert and can make mistakes) The reason banks don't have automatic transfers is because US banks still use ancient, giant computers from the early 60's that use an outdated programming language called COBOL that literally no one but the banks use. In this programming language, they create a ASCII (or maybe hexadecimal, can't remember which) representation of a bank transfer request from the 60's, into which they can input your information. Despite this system becoming more automated over the years, they haven't updated the actual transfer method. Imagine them sending a picture of a transfer request. I can't remember why exactly they don't operate on the weekends, maybe they still need some human intervention, but the point is that banks transfers of any kind are so slow because banks are cheap and don't want to bring their banking computers into this millennia, literally. As it's been explained to me, many European countries have legislation that requires a maximum of 10 seconds to complete ANY transfer, whether you're buying groceries or sending money, so pending charges should never be a thing, especially just because it's the weekend.

Maybe wanting to avoid it encourages super long posts. Since this is completly unproductive, I won't reply further to this off topic accusation of attacking original socialists by claiming they want to give welfare.

This is not a cheap gotcha, it is not the main point, I am not even sure how I criticize original socialism other than by bringing V2, implying that it is to be abandoned. 

Hardcore Socialists wanting to give borderless welfare would be far less absolutely awful and disastrous than their actual record. So it makes little sense as an attack against this perspective. Still world redistribution is a socialist dream, even if it isn't according to all old socialism prescriptions. Especially if you include the one leg into socialism larger numerically crowd.

Socialists have long dreamed of an equalization between the standards of living of the so called rich regions such as Europe, USA, and poorer other regions. An international socialist world order. And yes, this would entail redistribution in practice, since in socialism land, judging by its practices you would have probably money, and definitely different development, means of production, etc. Anyhow it would involve redistribution of resources from richer places, to poorer ones. Just seizing means of production wouldn't cut it to bring equality. It might even get propaganda that is about reversing the consequences of imperialism. Obviously this kind of redistribution and the one regarding the OP are not the same.

Now, it is possible that you could also have socialists who don't particularly care about such regional redistribution. World, and especially leftists are a diverse place. 

The point of all this is not that these people are all real orthodox socialists though. In fact the actual bigger group of people is people with one leg in socialism, and hoping for the close enough dream rather than orthodox socialists/communists. 

But there is an intellectual space of such desires, however much infighting, misunderstanding, difficulty to correctly adhere to orthodox socialism tm because of actual quite different political space and hurt feelings it might entail.

Quite importantly, it is a valid point to consider that the failures of socialism should at least motivate some caution. This could mean caution in supporting such redistribution or caution in the amount to be redistributed from richer regions to the poor, with taking into account the possible negative effects on the country doing the redistribution (or generally the negative effects of too much focus on redistribution). And caution could also include issues like considering the loss to redistribution. So indeed quite restrained versions would be further away from dreams of a world of equality of outcomes.

It is not an article about hardcore socialists tm (because that entitles even larger assumptions that are not necessary). That being said, it is true that the association between opposition of borders, international redistribution is going to also have the problem that it might make actual hardcore socialism tm more popular, or at least motivate some anti capitalist policy. 

Actual hardcore bad socialists tm and their thought, with their legacy of failure, and anti capitalism might influence things. Or not. It depends on how restrained the whole endeavor is or how radical.

I am not Muslim or from Eastern Europe/Eastern Asia, but I know someone from Albania, and they said how they and their family are culturally Muslim, and not extremely or very religious as Muslims in South and East Asia, and parts of Africa, and the Middle East are.  They drink alcohol and eat pork, and would not require a woman wear a headscarf today, or even in the 1970s and they are not radical or even moderate for Muslims, and are culturally a lot more like Greeks and Southern Italians from regions in modern day Italy where the Ancient Greeks settled like Calabria, in many ways except instead of being Greek Orthodox, Greek Byzantine Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox, Eastern Catholic, or Roman Catholic, are Muslim, and put their country as an identity first before that of their religion or Islam.

I also know people from Serbia, Bosnia, and Croatia, and they all said how for centuries Christians, Jews, and Muslims in their countries would intermarry, and were all culturally linked even before the creation of these modern day countries.

People are forgetting that when these countries were under Communist/Socialist control or part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, many people did practice religion in secret, but because the government and these countries were all atheist, they were not open about being religious or practicing a religion, and even religious Muslim women did not wear head scarves or any sort of coverings, and they were not radicalized or extreme, or even as religious or very strict with Islam, as people in Iran, Iraq, and other Middle Eastern/Western and South Asian and African countries can be.

All of the people who I have met from these countries have told me how for them their religion is a private matter, they are not really that public about it.  It does not mean that they keep it hidden or practice it in secret, or are atheist or not religious, they just are not public about their religion, don't practice their religion very publically the way some Muslims and Christians in other countries or regions of the world do, and a person's religion is a private matter kept within family or to yourself, and someone wearing a headscarf, hijab, or wearing a veil or niqab would be seen as being way too public about someone's religion.",True,False,False,,0,1530407366,,1530413040,0,e1kwdox,False,t3_8v4qap,False,t1_e1knzha,/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/8v4qap/a_possible_key_to_identifying_beth_doe/e1kwdox/,,1535532706,19,False,False,False,UnresolvedMysteries,t5_2wvvc,r/UnresolvedMysteries,public,

Then the sequel happens and it turns out seconds after that great scene Luke just casually tosses the lightsaber away for a cheap laugh. So now if I rewatch the Force Awakens I'll just be thinking of that when that scene comes up. TFA also built up the mystery of Rey and how she has these Jedi abilities. The first movie didn't explain that, but it seemed like the sequel would. Turns out according to TLJ, there is no compelling explanation and she is just given these great Jedi abilities with no real training. The Last Jedi was not only a poor movie in its own right, bu it also retroactively makes TFA a worse movie by throwing away the things that movie built up.

Counting is the action of finding the number of elements of a finite set of objects. The traditional way of counting consists of continually increasing a (mental or spoken) counter by a unit for every element of the set, in some order, while marking (or displacing) those elements to avoid visiting the same element more than once, until no unmarked elements are left; if the counter was set to one after the first object, the value after visiting the final object gives the desired number of elements. The related term enumeration refers to uniquely identifying the elements of a finite (combinatorial) set or infinite set by assigning a number to each element.



Counting sometimes involves numbers other than one; for example, when counting money, counting out change, ""counting by twos"" (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, ...), or ""counting by fives"" (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ...).

***

**Abacus**

The abacus (plural abaci or abacuses), also called a counting frame, is a calculating tool that was in use in Europe, China and Russia, centuries before the adoption of the written Hindu–Arabic numeral system. The exact origin of the abacus is still unknown. Today, abaci are often constructed as a bamboo frame with beads sliding on wires, but originally they were beans or stones moved in grooves in sand or on tablets of wood, stone, or metal.

Abaci come in different designs.

Wages grew in most eastern European countries and, indeed, to a much greater extent than in most western European countries, where wage growth was rather subdued or even negative, especially in Mediterranean countries; exceptions to this trend were Denmark, Germany, Ireland and France. Similarly, wage inequality declined in around two-thirds of EU countries (see final column in table), although there is no significant association between the changes in average wage levels and in wage inequality levels.

&gt;Three main patterns emerge from the analysis:

&gt; - Strong wage growth (4%–12%), mainly due to wages improving more among the lowest-paid employees (quintile 1), causing a fall in wage inequality. We see this pattern in much of eastern Europe – the Baltic countries, the Czech Republic, Poland and Romania – although not in Bulgaria, especially, nor Hungary, where wages grew more robustly among the higher-paid.

&gt;- More moderate wage growth (1%–3%), mostly due to wage increases among the highest-paid employees, leading to hikes in wage inequality. This is apparent in Denmark, Ireland, France, Italy and Finland.

&gt;- Wage declines or stagnation (growth of 1% or less) alongside falls in wage inequality generally, mainly due to wage reductions among the highest-paid (Quintile 5).

The only scene with Nate is when he’s walking with the picture of Nora in hand but he was carrying a laser rifle if memory serves me right. 

I understand how you see that I may be stretching my arguments but you can’t compare our modern military to fallout’s. they are so distinct from one another that there is no way to compare the two. The US in fallout are much more similar to the European Union in our world rather than our US. 

And again, the American commonwealths each operated very distinctly from one another. It’s also the reason why you don’t see major energy companies like Poseidon oil in the east coast but instead we have mass fusion in Massachusetts. So you have to see where I am coming from, we can’t just use examples from our world even if it is logical, as the fallout world differentiates from our world significantly. In fact the fact the establishment of the 13 commonwealths is what partially lead to the US to be crippled just before the bombs dropped.",True,False,False,,0,1530418639,,False,0,e1l5e2f,False,t3_8v1y3e,True,t1_e1l3smp,/r/fo76/comments/8v1y3e/soviet_firefighting_truck_spotted_in_fallout_76/e1l5e2f/,,1535536906,1,False,True,False,fo76,t5_jrw25,r/fo76,public,

You get two votes, the first for the local candidate in your election district, the second for a political party. The local candidates with the most votes get guaranteed seats in the parliament, the remaining seats are filled up with the different parties' list candidates until the seat distribution in the parliament matches the result of the party vote. Solves the FPTP problems completely, the seat distribution accurately reflects what the people voted for.

This usually results in 4 to 8 parties with a relevant number of seats in the parliament, each controlling between 5% and 40% of the seats (absolute majorities for one party are an uncommon result and perceived as potential rubber stamp parliament, as undemocratic).

But to form a government, you still need a majority of the seats. That's where coalition negotiations between the parties begin. A stage that filters out the fringe minority parties who see everyone else as enemy and can't compromise. That also filters out the egomaniacs, the poor negotiators, the idiots. In the end you get a government coalition of usually 2 or 3 similarly-aligned parties who have to compromise and work together to keep the government stable and running. Social Liberals with Greens, Social Liberals with Social Democrats and Socialists, Social Democrats with Christian Conservatives, whatever works.

A Donald Trump would never make it through the coalition negotiations.

For those of you wondering what the heck is going on, al-Husseini was the religious head and nationalist movement leader in the British colony of Palestine, and during WWII he threw his support behind Hitler and the Axis powers.

al-Husseini was born in the Ottoman Empire, a multi-ethnic entity that as we know crumbled after WWI. In fact, he served in WWI himself. As a result of the Empire’s collapse, European powers split up large swaths of the Middle East into largely arbitrary nations. Some nationalist thinkers wanted to reunite these nations along religious lines (Islam) because it transcended ethnic divisions. Al-Husseini also hoped if nothing else, for simple autonomy for Palestine from the British. 

 It must be noted there were significant religious riots between Jews and Muslims at the time particularly concerning access to the Western Wall. Riots were not uncommon leading up to WWII. Al-Husseini wanted wanted more control. When riots, and then an outright rebellion broke out in 1939 he was accused by the British of having incited violence. It was in this climate that he gambled on the Axis Powers, and threw in his lot with Germany. Palestinians sympathized with Germany as both nations felt they’d been given a raw deal after the treaty of Versailles. 

In the end it was largely a fruitless alliance. al-Husseini toured Bosnian troops, promised to issue propaganda in Arabic favorable to the Nazi’s and Hitler sent him a couple of planes.

some friends of ours here in Rojava are currently involved in teaching English in the revolutionary youth structures in nearby cities and villages. 

If you are interested in the principles of the revolution and able to seriously commit to a minimum of 6 months (preferably more) then we would be very happy to hear from experienced revolutionary and internationalist teachers of any subject (not just English).

Of course, you should be aware that this is not going to be a TEFL teaching abroad experience, and ask how and why you want to teach (and learn). Many young people leave Rojava to Europe and we certainly don't want to create lessons which wrongly paint the English-speaking world as a dream destination where all their troubles will be solved. 

But there is also a strong need for English-language education in today's world, and it is also possible to work together with students to develop a critical and revolutionary approach to the language. The same goes for skilled educators in fields like engineering, programming, medicine, the sciences and so on...

If you'd told a Syrian in February 2011 that their nation was about to be fractured and destroyed by a devastating civil war, most would have refused to believe you.

This sort of thing precedes most major human catastrophes. Notably, in the run up to the First World War there were a lot of people claiming a war between the major powers was now impossible; it'd be too economically devastating, too suicidal. But just because they didn't want to think about it, didn't stop it from happening.

Fortunately, even at its worst, Brexit won't be as bad as either of those examples. Nevertheless, it's extremely foolish - and very human - to just assume 'it'll all be alright' despite all proof to the contrary.

So, what is the worst case scenario?

The day comes.

00:00: Dover shuts its doors. Because we've left the EU without any sort of deal or plan, there's no contingency for the vast tonnage of traffic that passes through the port daily. They cannot possibly handle the current throughput with full tariff processing; the port simply lacks the necessary facilities. The A2 and A20, and then the M2 and M20, become a single vast lorry park - Operation Stack on steroids.

08:00: The London supermarkets open. The city wakes up to headlines about the near-total shutdown of trade to our biggest trading partner.

08:05: People suddenly realise that the UK doesn't produce enough of its own food, and that we're no longer capable of bulk import. Worry spreads through social media like flames on petrol. People start rushing to the supermarkets.

08:15: Panic buying has stripped the London supermarkets clean. Millions of Londoners - I've heard 6M, but can't find a source - realise that they literally don't have their next meal in the fridge.

11:00: Londoners are starting to get really, really frightened. Roads out of the city are at a standstill, major protests are spontaneously forming throughout the city.

16:00: A very large number of people are starting to get very hungry. Protesting starts turning to large-scale rioting, far beyond the capacity of the Met to handle.

18:00: The Houses of Parliament are on fire.

20:00: The UK government has completely collapsed, MPs have fled or been lynched, the pound has plummeted into worthlessness. The banks and the entire UK economy collapses overnight due to our currency suddenly failing.

21:00: A great many people go to bed hungry. Fires rage throughout London.

The various systems that underlie civilisation will break down extraordinarily quickly, especially once the currency collapses.

The electrical grid will probably keep going for a little while, at least until people start stripping up the copper cabling. Some bit of the civil service may manage to keep the power-stations running for a little bit, the French will probably keep some power flowing under the channel, the renewables won't go down. Expect the lights to stay on even if the government doesn't, possibly falling back to rolling blackouts, then total local blackouts over weeks and months as the infrastructure gets stolen.

The mobile networks will go down immediately, especially in high-pop areas, as everyone in Britain starts making panic calls. Hopefully the phone networks will be quick enough on the ball to promise to pay their staff in foreign currency as the pound plummets, probably the EU will pick up the maintenance bill medium term, so the network may hopefully come back online - although don't plan for it.

Everyone's British-based savings will, of course, be instantly rendered worthless. The whole financial system will disappear as a factor pretty much immediately.

Within a very short period, probably a few days, the EU will intervene as a humanitarian effort. People will die in the rioting and immediate aftermath, but we hopefully won't be looking at mass starvation.

The immediate transition period (4-6 weeks) will be very rough. All of the major population centres will empty out relatively quickly, a vast wave of terrified, homeless refugees will spread from each. Expect violent crime, looting, theft. Stay off the major travel routes; it'll probably be better to go cross-country than follow the motorways.

Short term (1 year), the UK population will dip dramatically as a wave of British refugees flee the country. Traditionally, in times of crisis, populations return to the family farm, but the UK has been industrialised for so long that for most people this is not an option. Again, violence and theft will be a major issue, the rule of law will likely be patchy. Expect local communities to become very important.

Medium term (2-3 years), the UK will almost certainly collapse into its constituent nations, and even those will barely qualify as unified countries. Northern Ireland may be absorbed into the Republic of Ireland. The EU and UN will probably send significant aid to keep people from starving, and the EU will probably invest significantly to try and get the economy restarted, but expect kleptocracy and looting to have utterly destroyed most UK infrastructure.

Medium-to-long term (4-10 years), the various bits of the UK will start to rebuild, their economies will start to have value. Almost certainly all fragments of the UK will apply to join the EU, and adopt the euro as a stable currency. Starvation will no longer be a risk, but there'll be very little worthwhile employment and UK talent will brain-drain the hell out, slowing economic recovery.

Long term (30-40 years), the fragments of the UK will rebuild to medium-sized, unimportant developed nations, assuming all else is equal in the global sphere. None of them will ever enjoy the economic or political prominence of the UK, but they'll be mostly OK.

Now, I stress that this is the worst-case scenario. It is, however, a high-impact/low-probability potential future, and the day it happens is too late to be preparing. Have a plan, have what you need ready beforehand, and then hope it all turns out OK in reality.

I can't tell everyone else how they should prepare, but I can tell you what I and my family plan, and maybe that will help inform your thought process. Note that this is not Doomsday prepping. Whatever happens, the UK will probably start to recover within a few years. You need to have a plan for a transition, and options for the short-to-medium term.

I'm very fortunate in that my family has access to a large piece of arable ground, and we've just built a house on it that's energy self-sufficient, well insulated, has access to a fresh-water well, a self-contained septic tank, and a well-equipped small workshop. We're also in a rural area, with a local community that's food-producing rather than consuming.

Each of my family will have a bug-out bag capable of getting them from where they are (e.g. London) up to the family home, on foot. This includes boots, water filters, high-energy-density rations, paper maps, etc.

We will have bought in advance a large quantity of rice and grain, which will get us through the winter until we can start producing food. We will also have a broad range of vegetable seeds (no monocultures), and the tools to farm them. This will get us through immediate and short-term food troubles.

We will keep the car filled with fuel ahead-of-time.

We have enough money in a foreign bank account and currency to buy four plane-tickets out to relatives in Canada, even at panic-prices, should matters somehow become even worse.
There is a terrifying trend amongst everyone I know to just assume 'it will all be OK'. This is an assumption based on some underlying idea that our current government is lead by competent people with some sort of long-term view and dedication to the public good.

Unfortunately, if you line that mental picture up with one of our current government, the two don't line up anywhere.

Don't just assume it will all be fine. Have a plan, get your options sorted ahead of time.

It's the same reason why the age of consent differs between countries, why age of consumption and type of legal drugs vary between countries, it is why capital punishment is practices in some and not others. The law is merely an application of the values of the society it is meant to reflect, nothing more.

Yep, no law is inherently just, however no law is inherently unjust. There are many laws that are in place which work in the legal system that are supported by and benefit the community as a whole.

It's amusing that you are stating I should be better educated in history, when you are in part advocating a legal system based on your personal interpretation of the law, something dictators and fascists do in order commandeer the legal system for their own ends.

&gt; A) Most other countries are ethnostates and have immigration policies historically grounded in laws of language and blood. 

Most countries regardless of history have border controls. America is not the only 'nation of immigrants'. Canada, Australia, and New Zealand are all Western nations that have just as many immigrants as the USA yet also have border controls. Every single nation in the world controls it's borders to ensure 

&gt; B) The U.S. is NOT an ethnostate, and no argument for ethnic, religious, or cultural restriction of admission to our republic can have any basis other than a racist one. 

The US is a Western nation influenced by European culture, values and religion. Anyone denying that is denying reality. Yes there was minor influences from various nationalities that came over to the US, however they were in no way the primary drivers of what the US is today. Saying the US is not a European based country because it had immigration is like saying England is not European based because it has such a large Asian population.

However, the US doesn't restrict people on racial grounds. It restricts them on based relations with the foreign countries, the likelihood that people will not follow their visa conditions, the likelihood that they will be a danger to it's citizens, and finally whether they will be beneficial to the country.

&gt; Also it's supper convenient to appeal to ""Other"" nations practices when it suites you. Tell me; do you support socialized national health care?

Uh, as someone from Australia - yes. However we also have border control and like to determine who comes into the country as well.

This isn’t an accusation though, since almost everyone is susceptible to this. It almost plays out like the Yanny Laurel phenomenon, where your brain is primed to hear what you want, and it becomes nearly impossible to see the other side. Likewise, you can see that legitimate studies into politics will show that almost every person will have never changed their political ideologies their whole lives.

To resolve this, I found some steps to take. One is identifying key words. Human rights. What is human rights? I think you would argue it due something to natural rights and freedoms- which is? Just as a reminder, Locke stated his revolutionary philosophy that humans all deserve life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness more than a thousand years after counting years became a thing. Jefferson changed that pursuit of happiness to property another few hundred years after Locke. And if you noticed, there have never been a single slave revolt for the sake of liberty alone until 300 years ago. Spartacus, they were forced to fight to the death with each other, helots, they were often beaten to near death. If you read any historical accounts, people do not mention freedom, but rather how people use or abuse their social power in context of other people. This is just to prime your brain to think more in depth.

Many of your rhetorical questions are based on an assumption which you are arguing. eg “would it have been okay if plantation era slaves had been treated better, etc?” This is called begging the question. Again, I may have stated a possible counterargument already in the paragraph above, but that’s not what I’m getting at. As for your last statement, the Bible also made provisions for slavery, and it said to treat them well (I’ll give verses if you need, but I’ll leave it at that.)

Anyways, I agree that in modern contexts and given modern situations, slavery is bad. It is now detrimental to our society economically, which is the North in America and Europe gave up slavery quickly. And it has too much potential for abuse, especially in a current society where most people don’t think or remember that a higher power is watching over them. And with a more mobile socioeconomic class and machines, it would serve everyone’s best interest to be independent. So it’s having freedom over slavery now is good. But rules of socioeconomic and whatnot were vastly different back then. Do you know Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr? I think the way he puts it is really insightful, that laws and morality are at a constant flux, and decisions should be made based on the present state of these.

[Picture 3](https://i.imgur.com/O2H0mFO.png): This hand symbol is the Volksfront, an American Neo-Nazi front. 

[Picture 4
](https://i.imgur.com/3Ha2Zqf.png): More Volksfront and the Peace Symbol, however, the Peace Symbol is at a tilt. This tilt is the same tilt used by Ku Klux Klan. Usually, the Klan also has a Nazi-Salute with the other hand.

Nazis are a strange type of people. They know that they're considered vile globally and as such, they try to blend in or add codes to identify one another as they realise they cannot be public with their racist and terrible ways. But they're getting smarter with how to use symbols, like the OK-Signal. It was initially a troll from 4chan to get the Media latching onto it. This worked, but 4chan is incredibly stupid. If White Supremacists will use the Symbol, it becomes a White Supremacist Symbol.

Half the UK cabinet has been on record saying they don't want any sort of deal and will actively oppose any sort of attempt to make a deal.

The EU is nowtelling those who need to know what a no-deal scenario means for them, so they can make plans.

Sure it would have been better for everyone if some sort of agreement could be reached where existing certifications for UK entities get grandfathered in or at least remain valid for a transtioning period, while the UK rebuilds their own regulatory institutions and that in the end of the day some sort of mutual recognition between the EU and the UK regulators gets established (mostly with the  UK promising to obey all the EU rules without having a say in it),  that would have been the sane thing to do.

But since the UK is increasingly likely to not be able to negotiate such a transition, this is the obvious result.

For one, here is the following:

[4th millennium BC / Cultures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4th_millennium_BC#Cultures) 

From a broad perspective, it was still the Uruk period in Mesopotamia, which was the precursors to the Sumerians (and the Uruk period was after the Ubaidian period/culture).

Second, we still have to consider the [Indus Valley Civilisation / Harappan Civilisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_Valley_Civilisation) which developed along the Indus river, and more than likely had contact with the Uruk period, if not the Sumerians. I believe the Sumerians and Harappans traded as well, since it was a matter of using the coast to transport goods. There are cuneiform/sumerian tablets/writing they have found in the Indus valley civilization, which shows they had some form of cultural contact.

Third, we still have the [Naqada culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naqada_culture) developing around the Nile river and up to around 3100 BC, which shows at that time the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt by Narmer, so essentially, there was probably some form of trade between Sumeria and Egypt as well. 

Additionally, we still have the Vinca culture as well, in SE Europe.

And I haven't even touched on [Göbekli Tepe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe) which raises even more questions, than answers.

I guess my point here is that there's a bunch of dis-info, or bad information out there that is being pumped by really nasty media that isn't the truth, and very distorted. I've had this argument before, and I could see to an extent how the Giants/Nephilim would come into play, even out of the Bible/Genesis creation story, and now how today's media plays the Annunaki into this myth cycle.

Sumeria wasn't as advanced as today's media likes to prop up, and if anything, they came on the scene about the same time as the other cultures such as Egypt, Indus, early Chinese as well. 

Again, don't take this personally, I just wanted to point out some dates and correct a few things that are getting pushed in today's media which puts WAY to much emphasis on the Ancient Alien/Annunaki stuff.

*The Class Struggle*, there is a De Leon translation, and a more modern Translation. The modern one is closer to the original German.

*The Dictatorship of the Proletariat*

*The social revolution and On the morrow of the social revolution*

Don't mind the seemingly ""hardcore"" titles, Kautsky was quite the softie for his time. It is however NTK for context that Kautsky ""finished"" *Capital*, and as such, one should at least understand the basics of what Marx, Engels, and Kautsky outlines in said work.

* Bernstein:

*The Preconditions of Socialism.*

*Evolutionary Socialism: A Criticism and Affirmation.*

Bernstein was one of the spearheading writers when it comes to what I call Germanic, or Continetal, Social Democracy, as opposed to Anglo Social Democracy. This is because the British Labour movement is a bit different from the continetal Social Democratic movements, and as such we should look at them differently. He is also one of the reasons why it is important to distinguish between Labour- and Social Democratic Parties.

* Bauer

*The World Revolution*

*The Road to Socialism*

*Bolshevism or Social Democracy?*

Especially the last one in this list is important to understand the huge changes in internal commotion that the Bolshevik revolution caused in the International Socialist movement, starting already in Zimmerwald in 1915

* Lassalle 

*The Working Man's Program*

*What is Capital?*

This is primitive-Social Democracy. The absolute basis. While Marx' works greatly shifted the nature of the young Socialist movement, traces of Lassalle still exist up to this day

* Renner

I only brought up Renner because I live in an EU member-state, and his Austro-Marxism which applied to the many nations within the Austro-Hungarian empire can kinda be applied to the modern EU.

*State and Nation*

Sucked at good mining badly but as both were engineers decided to build houses and equipment instead when they ran out of money.

Made a fucking fortune and then went off to try mine gold in South Africa. They both still sucked at mining so build shit again and got even richer.

They then fought in he Boer War, both survived one got mentioned in dispatches etc 

They then tried mining in California and still sucked so built houses and shit again and eventually went to San Francisco in 1909 and used their now considerable house building skills to make more money.


They then went to South America and helped build a load of government buildings that are still around and build sections of the trans Andean railway.


Came home massively rich and loaded with weird and wonderful shit. Got married had kids then went off to the First World War. Both survived and lived happily ever after.

Apart from the whole ridiculous adventures and not realising they sucked at mining my direct relative brought home a load of South American antiques including a jade mask and a load of other shit.

His wife decides it's all evil witchcraft shit and takes it and throws it out.

We have a part inventory of the shit he brought back.

It'd be worth fucking millions today if only we knew where she threw the stuff to get rid of it!!!

As for the rest of the money.....my great grandfather lived like a king, my grandfather blew the rest between 1947 and the 60's.

I can't blame him, by all accounts his WW2 was immensely shit so he basically lived life to the max after the war, taking the ""grand tour"" around Europe ever year or two until the money ran out.

All that's left is a cool story and the nagging thought that somewhere only about 20 miles away from me as I type is a fucking hoard of South American and Africa treasure and antiques that are worth millions.

I forgive my grand father for living it up, after almost dying a few dozen times and not going home for years I can't blame the man.

Okay, so. I'm from EU and this is very well known here - there is a ""hierarchy"", if you will, of nationalities in the workplace. For example, if there's a German company in Germany in the IT industry and the German worker gets paid ~2300 a month then the Polish immigrant will be paid ~1200, Russian will be paid ~900, Somalian will be paid ~600, etc. This is how it works all over the west and its not because of race. Its about being relatively well paid in comparison to previous jobs, etc. The more hopeless and poor the person is the better. This, when applied to entire national economy, drives the wages down to pennies.



Second of all if you import a ridiculous amount of people from the 3rd world then your entire country, culturally and economically, will be transformed into what the new majority used to have in their old countries. There is no magic dirt, there is no transformation. Its just people being who they are.

I wonder if what what's happening is the effects of the change and polarization of high population urban progressives/migrants and the more culturally connected rural populations. That could explain why a nation could rank low on median scores for nationalist sentiment but have a high % score, as this score includes the higher population of urbanites far removed from the cultural connection to their nation and growing populations of migrants that would, for obvious reasons, likely have a greater disposition to not hold nationalist sentiments. However the population of rural people whos culture and nationalist sentiments have been isolated from the social change in urban zones are also included, however they're a lower percentage of total population. That could explain the extremely low median, and (contextually) high percentage score. Goes to show the unfortunate impact of high populations in cities being influenced by the surrounding culture. For the 25% of people who still believe in a national identity, they unfortunately are no longer influential enough to matter.

If it's not what you voted for, can you perhaps point out some official government documentation from before the referendum that outlined Brexit as 'the thing that you *did* vote for'? Was there something that defined the terms of a leave result as meaning 'exactly what you have in mind'? Spurious claims from unaccountable campaign groups are not an official definition.

Because from where I sit, it looks like people voted to leave the EU... without any plan in place about how to do that, what model we'd be seeking, what to expect it to go like, etc.

In elections, parties release manifestos that outline exactly what people are voting for when they vote for those parties. Whether manifesto pledges are carried out or not pretty much defines the success/failure of the resulting government. With Brexit, I have yet to see anything resembling a Brexit manifesto, and as such that option is entirely left undefined. We went for the undefined option, and handed carte blanche to the Conservative party to deliver Brexit in whatever way they saw fit. That is happening, so it can be said that Brexit is a resounding success no matter how fucked we end up from it.

* Secure departure from the EU ✅

* Invoke article 50 ✅

* Negotiate with EU officials ✅

* Leave EU - In progress

This total lack of an official definition is *exactly why* there was all that fuss about hard Brexit, soft Brexit, red white and blue Brexit, full English Brexit, continental Brexit... etc immediately after the referendum. Theresa May helpfully quelled all that with ""Brexit means Brexit"". This total lack of an official definition is *exactly why* no two leave voters have an identical vision of Brexit. This total lack of an official definition is *exactly why* the likes of BoJo and Gove are swanning around the place touting their own version and getting away with being all high and mighty at May... their versions are more popular (and less realistic)... and she can't correct them by pointing to 'what Brexit means' and what the public voted for. It's also exactly why Theresa May can't get her shit together and make any meaningful progress.

The shitshow is a direct result of nobody having a clue what Brexit even means. I'm not talking about 'Brexiteers are stupid and ignorant hurr hurrr', I'm talking about there being no meaning attached to the word in the first place. So yeah... if you knew what Brexit meant when you voted, then you're either God or you're from the future. The definition has not been put in place, and therefore the word is going to remain undefined until the end results of it pan out.

Cameron's government lies at fault for this. They called the referendum without first working on a plan to put to the people as one of the options in the referendum.

According to the polling, the biggest single issue for voting leave was “the principle that decisions about the UK should be taken in the UK”, 33% of leave voters felt that leaving “offered the best chance for the UK to regain control over immigration and its own borders.”' and so voted leave. It was important, it wasn't the only issue though, and it probably wasn't the most important. And again, we have had a long period where leave would likely have won a referendum on EU membership, including well before freedom of movement became a vocal issue.

From a characterization perspective, I think Elio being an only child is intentional. Samuel and Annella clearly adore him, but it's also clear that they very much have their own lives and *lifestyle*, which they enjoy, and it's perhaps not all that conducive to the presence of multiple children. Elio seems to be expected to fit himself into those lives - unlike modern helicopter parents, they don't seem to live their lives around *him*. Maybe they also just liked the dynamic of a trio - they got whatever they hoped to get from parenthood by just having Elio, and were content with that choice.

As an aside - I seem to recall a fan from either a European or Asian country reporting that in their translation of the novel, Elio actually has an older brother, whose absence is never elaborated upon, he is simply 'away'. Has anybody else seen that information discussed? It makes me wonder if that country actually released a (perhaps earlier) differently-edited draft of the book, and the passage was deleted in other editions.

The issue is over any special agreements we might arrange with the EU as part of that decision to leave.   The EU is a powerful trading partner and our economies are intertwined so it would be highly desirable to form such an agreement, and highly costly not to.  The thing about an agreement is... both sides have to agree.  It's precisely because EU is a union of sovereign nations that we can't force them to agree to anything, and they can't force us to agree to anything.

a) constituted a loss of sovereignty 

b) was something unique to our membership of the EU and would somehow not apply out of it.

This was obviously deceptive and silly.  All agreements with other countries require compromise and in many cases, external systems of arbitration. 

What article 50 puts in place is a framework for coming to an agreement.

I had a “normal”/slim figure up until 5 years ago when I got on the antidepressant Saroten and gained 35 kg (77 lbs) in less than six months. After the weight gain I changed my meds, but I hated my body and was still heavily depressed so over the past 4 years I slowly gained an additional 10 kg (22 lbs) due to an unhealthy diet.

Now I finally feel better - depression wise - and in March 2018 I started counting calories (without weighing myself). Finally towards the end of april i started to track my weight and since then (in 9 weeks) I’ve lost 7,5 kg (16.5 lbs), started going to power yoga classes 2-3 times a week and I’ve started to eat much healthier. 
I also have a dog that I walk for almost 3 hours a day - I guess that counts as exercise too! And I bike to and from my job.

My goal for this challenge is to try be more patient (I’ve noticed that I’m extremely impatient about my weight loss), keep counting calories, lose about 10 lbs and keep up my yoga.

This summer I’m going to be a camp counsellor and afterwards I’m starting an internship so I know it’s gonna be a struggle to keep counting calories because at camp I’m not going to be preparing my own food and when I get back my everyday schedule is going to be quite different than what I’m used to.",True,False,False,,0,1530439813,,False,0,e1lgynn,False,t3_8uu1gd,True,t3_8uu1gd,/r/team_2ndbreakfast/comments/8uu1gd/welcome_and_introductions/e1lgynn/,,1535542776,2,False,True,False,team_2ndbreakfast,t5_km0ja,r/team_2ndbreakfast,public,

A questão aqui é que não se usa o pronome reflexivo nessa construção de verbo estar + particípio, mesmo que o verbo seja reflexivo. Por exemplo:

*Ele se sentou* —&gt; *Ele está sentado* (e não *Ele está se sentado*)

*Ele se machucou* —&gt; *Ele está machucado* (e não *Ele está se machucado*)

**Experience:** I've been playing WoW on and off for years, but only got into raiding in Legion/7.3.5 after having been gone from the game for a few months. So far, I've been playing 'on my own' in LFR and am really motivated to get into higher levels of play while keeping the focus on having fun while doing so. I'm still pretty new to this aspect of the game though.

**What I'm bringing to the table:** I am currently maining a DH (mostly Havoc) and have some experience on Rogue (mostly Outlaw), but have a 110-toon for almost all of the classes and wouldn't mind switching to a different main if needed (DPS and/or Healing). I consider myself a quick learner and am definitely willing to accept guidance from more experienced players. Switching factions/realms is not an issue for me, also wouldn't mind boosting a new character, if necessary. Toxic behaviour is something you won't be seeing from me.

**What I'm looking for in a guild:** Mostly just a friendly, fun environment that's accepting of people still learning the game and doesn't tolerate toxic behaviour. I am also not looking for hardcore raiding, but rather casual progression. First and foremost, I play WoW to have fun and would love a guild that keeps the focus on that while still taking things fairly serious. I'm not interested in PvP-stuff. (Bonus points if it's a German-speaking guild, but that's not a must.)

**Schedule:** Two raid nights during week days would be perfect for me. (I'm a freelancer that's mostly working on weekends.) Occasionally, I could probably do one more. But don't quote me on that. ;)

There's a TL;DR at the bottom to sum this up shorter if you find this too long of a read.

From what we have in game, we are outright told that Ashfeld itself is monotheistic. Apollyon, for all her warmongering, is an incredibly reliable narrator when it comes to the cultures of the three factions. After all, it was her in depth understanding of those cultures that allowed her to figure out how to enact her plans. From all the symbols the knights have for outfits - including outright crusader crosses - as well as the architecture with angels and such, we made the logical conclusion. The knights were something akin to Christianity even if they were not actually Christian of any denomination we would define. And honestly, I don't think we ever expected an outright answer.

""But what of Apollyon saying the gods of the knights are of metal and gold""? So, is Odin literally made of wood and spirit then? That was a metaphorical observable, about what each faction associates with the divine - vastly different ideas, but they all agree on power. Could that mean a degree of polytheism? Sure, I don't think anyone said it was impossible, and this is a topic where nuance rules out over absolutes. And that was what made Roman's answer so problematic - he made it absolute, when he should have said something like 'the knights are not united under one specific faith'. The way he put it, with all the Greco-Roman stuff, made it sound like the knights were supposed to be worshipping the Greek gods under their Roman names. IE, it came off that he was saying my Warden should be praying to Minerva before bed or my Lawbringer invoking Jupiter (AKA Zeus) for authority when condemning a rapist to be hanged.

Now I have never opposed the Greco-Roman stuff simply because it is Greco-Roman. That culture had always been a topic of fascination by medieval scholars and Rome was often invoked as from where legitimacy stemmed from - the Holy Roman Empire, while perhaps never any of the three, was meant to be a continuation of the legacy of the Western Roman Empire if only in spirit. My issue had always been that there was over five hundred years of culture being glossed over in the process. It was getting Greco-Roman time and again in every release that wore us down to the point where this tweet set off a firestorm, because the knights were beginning to feel like our concept was being heavily diluted away from the pitch that got us onboard, especially since both our DLC heroes were Romans. Yes, I am aware the Vikings got a Gael and a Pict, but the Highlander was explicitly a foreign ally and the Shaman was only revealed to actually be a Pict and another foreign battle thrall months after her release, until then she had us all fooled since she so neatly fit into the Warborn roster conceptually. The Gladiator, by contrast, is just at odds with the rest of the faction's aesthetic.

Now, my personal headcanon is that the knights as a whole were Christian - a blend of them but taking more from Orthodox Christianity as I always felt that, thematically speaking, it fit them because it lacks any specific single religious authority because it is split between several Patriarchs. Yet I knew it was a headcanon; for all I knew the knights were meant to be Cathars, which is still a historical branch of Christianity if an obscure one (also an interesting read if you want to look them up). And of course the Centurion and Gladiator were probably Roman Polytheistic; but I didn't mind that as long as it was understood that they were foreign allies the same as the Highlander and Pict, not representative of the actual knights themselves. Okay sure, maybe Gladiators are more widespread in various arenas fighting to entertain the masses and kept to it, but it didn't have to be a large segment of the population.

Even then, I always felt the Deus Vult meme was overused. Hell, when writing *Honor's Trial* I headcannoned up a whole legion meant to *mock* that meme and the fact we kept getting our shit kicked in early on. But hey, it was fun and the Crusades are one of the most iconic time periods that knights existed in, even if they failed utterly after the First Crusade.

Now, if Ubisoft really just did not want to touch a religion that is currently a large segment of the world because ultimately it wasn't a major facet of *For Honor*? Then Roman should have just given a vague answer that the knights were not unified under any single doctrine, or point to the observable Apollyon had made. It would have left it vague, but it would not have been such a slap in the face and could have been taken as a graceful non-answer. I don't think anyone ever truly expected the devs to come out and say ""Yes, the knights are meant to be Roman Catholic Christians"" or anything like that, but we didn't expect such a clumsy retcon either.

I mean, if the Warborn can scream about Odin and Valhalla while the Orochi can beseech her ancestors for strength while fighting Apollyon, why can't the knights be left with the implication they were monotheistic from the observables and general aesthetic? I mean even then for all the DV memes the knights in-game always seemed to be more grounded and worldly rather than pious. Just say that the knights do not feel the zeal to shove it down everyone's throats by book or sword and don't scream about it, and leave it at that.

So, for me I feel the issue is not that the knights are not exclusively monotheistic - Apollyon's observable spoke about Ashfeld, and we know there are plenty of lands beyond Ashfeld that the knights inhabit. The issue was that after everything, it felt like a clumsy retcon that instead the knights were meant to be Roman Polytheistic rather than just having some Jupiter-worshiping allies fighting alongside them. But I refuse to ascribe malicious intent to Roman about this. I think he meant to give a quick answer that was true (since if the Cent has kept to those ancient gods and he is part of the Legion roster, that does make it true on the technical point), but unfortunately it was taken as an absolute answer about the entire faction when it was meant to have a degree of nuance.

And coming on the heels of ""Chinese and Japanese are different"" - which, I should specify, is also absolutely true even if they could have had a Chinese hero in the Chosen roster if they only made one, as long as they specified it was a foreign ally - it seemed like a huge slap in the face to the knights who joined for the Medieval European Knights. It came off as Classical Age Europe = Medieval Europe and a massive double standard. And from that, we got pissed off because of building tension and worry from seeing so little knightly stuff added to our collection was finally hit with a spark.

Anyways, for those who felt the above is a case of Too Long; Didn't Read:

* In game we are told Ashfeld is monotheistic, and so that colored the perception of what the knights were even if there are more lands beyond Ashfeld. It felt like it was implied but not outright stated because Ubisoft didn't want to touch it since it was more of a piece of fluff to the game than a key focus. Easier to just let it be implied by that and the faction's aesthetic and architecture, right?
* The Greco-Roman outfits and items and the Roman heroes, while not innately wrong, made it increasingly feel like the knights were being taken off concept by a sudden interest in Classical Age Europe, without enough spacing to make it seem like it was just an extra spark rather than bastardizing the faction.
* The Wu Lin being separate, even if it was just a matter of number of hero concepts that sparked it, made this bad taste even worse as the differences were specifically called out.
* Roman's answer to the question of the knight's religion was too blunt and absolute, making it appear thanks to the above that he was clumsily retconning the knights to Greek Polytheistic under the names Rome had for them.
* Even though it was not meant maliciously, the apparently absolute answer set off a the building tension from all the above. If he intended nuance of 'the knights are not unified under a specific faith', he completely lost it by making a one-word answer.

Yes.. it's a conversation after all.

&gt;Re read again . It's you who have agenda here some how justifying you lack of political power to deal with EU.

I want to see the UK outside of the EU, but I'd also prefer it if people who discuss the issue do so while looking at the reality of the situation, not some mistaken understanding. The common ones are that the UK doesn't manufacture, or that it is a small economy, or that it is somehow militarily dependent on the EU..

&gt;If you cannot deal with EU being part of it and having many concessions you get from EU . UK is failure .

Why? How does not wanting to be in the EU a failure? Moreover, the UK as an EU member is one of 27, it can't force the other members to do things, or to move in a given direction, and it'd be a bit of a problem if it could do that against the wishes of the others. That's not a failure either, but it's a good reason to leave the EU.

&gt;How is Germany and France being inside EU still have larger global footprint. It's your fault to blame others when you are the one who is milking EU with special demands

Germany has a larger economy than the UK, militarily it is weaker than both France and the UK, in terms of international soft power, it's also fairly weak (although it has a lot of regional power, via the EU, not without limits of course). France and the UK are fairly similar, the UK has a marginally larger economy, but both have similar military capabilities (the UK again slightly ahead now with it's recent modernisation, but France isn't far behind), moreover, the UK and France work together on defence, outside of the EU.

But France and Germany also both see more benefits from EU membership than the UK does, and both France and Germany seem happier with a more integrated and centralised EU. The UK doesn't.  

Oh, and the UK isn't 'milding' the EU either. Germany has a rebate via VAT, and France is over-represented in terms of CAP payments (which is why the UK, Germany and others have adjustments to how much they end up passing to the EU in various ways).",True,False,False,,0,1530450832,,False,0,e1lmirn,False,t3_8uudwq,True,t1_e1lm6kp,/r/geopolitics/comments/8uudwq/brexit_last_call_for_deal_donald_tusk_warns_uk/e1lmirn/,,1535545397,1,False,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,

It's a good question and hard to answer. There was certainly broader cultural awareness of them before, and things like civil defense did play a role in that. I suspect (but it hard to know) that nuclear issues did come up more in courses during the Cold War than they do today.

Nuclear issues could be easily integrated into courses on history, political science, or science, if one wanted to do so. I'm a historian, so I think history is the natural fit for it, but I'd take what I could get. Personally I think an easy thing to argue for is more attention given to Cold War history in general — along with the nuclear topic, it sets up _many_ important concerns that resonate through the present day, and if you don't know the history of them, it's hard to have an informed opinion on the world. (Russia, espionage, Eastern Europe, People's Republic of China, North Korea/Korean War, nuclear weapons, Civil Rights Movement, decolonization, Soviet-Afghan War, proxy wars, Iranian Revolution, etc. etc.) In US history courses (so I think as an American historian), high school courses spend WAY too much time on the early stuff and frequently never get to the history whose role in shaping the present world is very direct.

No, it was just economically smashed, lost it's empire, lost its technological edge to the US, and obviously had lots of dead.

&gt;Unlike most other participants, it wasn't even invaded, and I think that's what they were getting at.

I don't think the UK is going to be invaded upon leaving the EU either though are we?

&gt;I definitely agree that there's a certain hubris to many natives, but I put that down to carryover from the fact that Britain was the last to have a properly vast, colonial Empire. The biggest in history, in fact.

I'm not sure what hubris is on display here though, the UK is looking to leave the EU, it's not invading France, there is the potential for a negative outcome, but it is not on a scale comparable to a world war.  Moreover, the UK has had to go through major economic disruptions several times, so this isn't even novel in that sense.

&gt;I have no problem with being proud about heritage, but when you're advocating for no deal unless you get your way, I worry about how much of a grasp a lot of people have concerning the economic implications of such a strategy.

Surely if the UK is advocating for a no-deal unless it gets its way, then the EU is too? The point is that the UK and EU need to find a deal they can agree to, that works for both.  The UK accepting a bad deal for the sake of it isn't somehow egotistical, it makes sense if there is no good deal on the table. And lets be clear, most people want a deal, just not at any cost.

The inspection can pay dividends in negotiations in my experience, especially if a mechanic is chosen the neither you nor the seller has a prior relationship with. For example, what I usually do is tell the seller that we'll set a number, say $300. This is after negotiating a price BTW. Anyway, I would agree with the seller that if it's any repair under $300, I won't renegotiate, but if it is, I'll attempt to reduce the price by the amount of the repair, if I'm even still interested at that point. Other benefits are if the seller balks at a pro inspection, that's a red flag. Also having bad news come from a respected mechanic eliminates the doubt for the seller that you could be scamming him buy coming up with some BS issue to drive the price down. Finally with an older European luxury car, repairs are going to be a bit pricier than a 96 Corolla, as I'm sure you already know, lol. So an abundance of caution is warranted. 

Also as a caveat I'm not a professional in anything related to cars, I've just bought and sold (and crashed) about 25 cars and have learned some things along the way. 

By the way another good trick is to bring a big piece of cardboard, throw it under the car after the test drive and leave it there while you talk with the seller, then pull it and see what's leaking.

This is a really dumb hill to plant your flag on. That was *this event* I've seen M rated runs in the afternoon Pacific Time before. More importantly, it's a 24 hour charity stream with a multinational audience. So what about the European children watching the event at their normal time?

&gt;The purpose of this event is to make money for charity

This is the only accurate statement in this paragraph.

&gt;show off the speedrun community in a positive light. 

Except it's not an accurate representation since clearly even mild humor is being met with fear tactics. It's had a chilling effect on the way people behave on the GDQ stream. Also, this is kind of superfluous given that each of those streamers is going home the following week and is going to adhere primarily to their personal preferences. So you aren't really portraying anything about the speed running community except maybe giving the people the wrong idea.

&gt;Having your runners make edgy jokes, or having them say nigger for donation money hampers your ability to grow as a mature organization.

The only reason you would need the organization to grow is if there was a financial incentive to do so. Nobody who raises money for charity is *EVER* disappointed when a goal isn't met. Usually people are just happy with what they can do. Considering GDQs roots are in someone's spare bedroom with 12ish chairs it's come a long way. Point being that it didn't need to continue to grow bigger, that was a deliberate decision.



&gt;Yeah maybe they make money for the massive amount of time and effort these things require.

My gripe isn't that they make money or that it doesn't require time or effort. My gripe is that it generates a *disproportionate* amount of money for the time and effort that goes into it. How many opprotunities have you had to pocket at minimum 50k for MAYBE 6 months of part time work (I really don't think event planning is that complicated.) In fact it's SO uncomplicated they can organize events AND work a day job twice a year no less.

&gt;Why is that so offensive to you?

Because it's disingenuous to present yourself as a non profit organization when you are a FOR profit organization representing a non profit organization.

&gt;Its like you pretend this is a zero effort affair to administrate, advertise for, get sponsors for, get people willing to throw their time and money at producing. If the people that administer this make some money for doing it, great, MSF or PCF gets over 2 million in donations for it.

If it's a non-profit effort, there should be volunteers involved. But setting that aside it's a common criticism of non profits anyway. People like to see that Non profits carry lean operating procedures. But If Mike Uyama saw 10% of the money raised last week, he's getting cut a check for $210,000. Even post tax he's going to see ~$150k of that and if he sinks $100k back into GDQ HE STILL made 50k in a single week. That's not lean by any means. Everyone involved in profiting from GDQ is making out like a bandit relatively speaking. 


&gt;If theres a community need/drive for another speedrunning event where you can go do all the shit you don't, or can't do at GDQs, it will pop up.

The current hurdle is legitimizing speedrunning. The big speedrunning events work explicitly because it's charity.

&gt;Or it won't, and all the people upset here about how GDQ isn't what they want will be here uselessly flailing instead of making their own speedrunning event with tacitly endorsed harassment and racism.

Yup. Typical ""Only racists and harassment enthusiasts can be dissatisfied with GDQ"" Strawman. Keep sucking that corporate dick.

Siege 2 isn't going to happen for the same reasons Overwatch 2, League of Legends 2, or Fortnite 2 won't happen. There's no real reason to go through the effort of making ""brand new games"" for them when they can change things as they go along. If Ubisoft truly feels they need to dedicate more time to their tech debt, they'll do an Operation Health 2 or end Rainbow Six development entirely. But unless they have a revolutionary idea for a Rainbow Six title, they won't invest in building a new game from scratch.

As for the engine, people woefully underestimate how much developers can change. The **AnvilNext 2.o**, terrible name, also powers Steep, For Honor, and Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands. It's used because it is incredibly versatile, and it's what the developers know and can work the best on. Changing engines would just add a new learning curve to an already difficult process.

Everything in programming references something else. It's an ever growing mangled mass of roots and branches where one small change in a seemingly unrelated area can ruin hours of work you did elsewhere. I'm inclined to think that no engine can solve this problem, only people. Frostbite and CryEngine are excellent for example, but have hundreds have extremely capable and passionate people dedicating all of their professional and personal time into making them run like butter.

That's not what Siege has at its disposal.

They're a content first team left behind to grow an existing product. That's why big graphical changes or the recoil/sight alignment changes take so long. Small teams doing their best while splitting with other responsibilities.

I'm a bit confused by this statement?

You vote for your local MP, who helps determine which party has majority seats. The party then internally choses a primeminister behind closed doors. That primeminster then chooses a representative. These are the people who create legislation.

Outside of that there are elections for EU members held at different times. These are completely separate from the leading party and are the people who amend, accept or deny legislation. And the people who vote on a president.

Le fait est que pour le moins polluer, le mieux vivre, il faut se réunir en haute densité. L'urbanisation a une raison, et l'étalement des cultures fait partie des maux qui fait mal à notre planète. De fait, si les humains se réunissaient dans des zones urbaines ultra-centralisées, citons l'exemple des arcologies qui sont la version optimale de ces zones, et faisaient des cultures très denses sur plusieurs étages autour, il serait possible de garder une nature bien plus imposante. Il ne faut pas oublier que l'Europe de l'Ouest est couverte de fermes et de forêts artificielles, et elle ne ressemble plus du tout à son état sauvage ou semi-sauvage de jadis. Pour qu'il y ait développement de nos sociétés et préservation de la nature, ça exige de tout changer. Et pas que dans les pays en voie de développement, mais aussi bien chez nous. 

Nous avons besoin des arbres pour la survie de l'écosystème et de nos planètes, et commencer à les replanter dans les pays qui ont le pouvoir et les moyens de le faire, serait déjà un grand pas en avant.

De fait, il faut recréer le lien humain-nature, mais en premier, il faut le recréer chez nous. Il est trop facile de juger des peuples pour ce que nous avons fait il y a un ou plusieurs siècles. Si on montrait l'exemple, on serait plus honnêtes, et on aurait là un vrai impact sur le monde.

Since Vatican II (the formally titled ""the 2nd Ecumenical Council of the Vatican,"" by Catholic reconing the 21st ecumenical council) the nature and work of women's &amp; men's religious communities have changed enormously. Coupled with ongoing social and economic changes in the 20th Century, the of people leading a vowed life in stable communities have dropped by 60&amp;#37; since a peak in the 50s, between the end of World War II and the Vatican II in the early to mid 60's. Simply put, women have more choices and rightfully so.

For example, see [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7227629.stm](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7227629.stm) and [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/vaticancityandholysee/10103961/Number-of-priests-and-nuns-in-marked-decline.html](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/vaticancityandholysee/10103961/Number-of-priests-and-nuns-in-marked-decline.html)

Religious life remains an option and, more properly, a calling for those few people truly called to it.

There is a crisis in some communities about how to care for aging members when there are so few young adults entering into religious life and staying in it.

The story telling version of religious life shows a fascination with this way of life without understanding it. There are not tens of thousands of fertile, young women available to be turned into Handmaids for the Commanders. Try a couple thousand nation-wide, tops.

As for the idea there are tens of thousands of nuns (who are monastics) and sisters (vowed religious but not monastic) available to labor in the Colonies, the only labor you're going to get out of those women is parking their walkers and wheel chairs. Those who aren't sick are in their 60s &amp; 70s, trying to bring in enough money for elderly nuns and sisters in assisted living &amp; nursing facilities.

I'm 32. I've been an Independent for most of my voting life.

I'd be all for a Democratic Socialist movement - and I make plenty of money now, and would like to spread some of that money to my peers through those socialistic benefits. I benefited greatly when I was growing up by my public library, by public roads, and by public education and community colleges. My experience with socialism so far has been nothing but positive.

My experience with Capitalism, meanwhile, has taught me several lessons. First among them was how Capitalism served me in my health. A doctor prescribed me broad-spectrum high-strength antibiotics and failed to tell me to take probiotics at the same time, resulting in my gut bacteria being near-completely wiped out - and allowing the bad bacteria to flourish. After a few hour stay in a hospital for extreme abdominal pain months later (which had been steadily getting slightly worse, but which I refused to go to the doctor to because money was tight) and nausea after seeking aid at a less expensive CareNow before being immediately recommended by them to a nearby hospital's ER where my pain, sweat, and nausea passed over several hours with IV fluids, but for which they could do nothing on my underlying condition but shrug their shoulders and say 'good luck', I was awarded with a bill that nearly bankrupted us.

You will get sick. You will be bankrupted like me. You don't have to be bankrupted - this cost could be distributed across society rather than placed squarely on your shoulders while insurance companies ensure that the prices remain sky-high for relatively little treatment. The same thing I went through, if I had lived in a country in Europe which provided access for socialized medicine, would've resulted in my paying perhaps $100 for all that instead of $14,500 for some doctors to tell me my life is in danger, shrug their shoulders, and then kick me out the doors. I also could've avoided having all sorts of health problems that resulted from my not going in to a doctor for fear it would bankrupt me to only be bankrupted later.

If I had lived in Europe, I would've been better off. I would be going to regular medical checkups, I wouldn't be paranoid about going to see doctors, and I wouldn't have to gamble with my health to *try* and keep myself capable of actually retiring when I get older.",True,False,False,,0,1530472158,,1530472426,0,e1m7911,False,t3_8v2nxi,True,t1_e1kef9c,/r/politics/comments/8v2nxi/the_millennial_socialists_are_coming/e1m7911/,,1535555053,1,False,True,False,politics,t5_2cneq,r/politics,public,

But Salvini's objective is now another: ""To transform ourselves also into a European force, into an international force, which goes beyond regional and national borders and brings freedom, work and security to all the peoples of Europe"".

I grew up in Brooklyn, my friends and I were nearly all the grandchildren of immigrants from Europe. While there were a couple that could speak another language to one degree or another, we were all native English speakers, schools didn't teach in anything other than English then.

Your neighbors were all Americans, you might have Greek or Italian neighborhoods, but these children of immigrants were living right next door for the most part.

So the Father, being an avatar of balance, is still light.

That was his old comment before he was part of the writing team of ghost of mortis. Lucas is someone who is well known to change his mind on his stories (which can be seen in the OT movies) so him changing his mind on the force is something that is kinda shown in that arc. Especially with how the dark and the light side is controlled by the balance, the father. He was the perfect force user to me in this new version of ""balance"" that lucas probably picked up on with all the other EU media that portrayed it as such. I mean the force unleashed was canon to him before the purge and you have Galen Marek using both the light and dark side as well. 


&gt;As Luke explains in TLJ, the Force is part of (or between) nature, which contains both life and death. Yoda considers death a natural part of life, and dying is ""the way of the Force"". For a Jedi, it means transcendence. Besides, plenty of Jedi bring death; what's the difference between Bendu bringing down ships with a storm or Luke killing millions aboard the Death Star?

Exactly, that is the **JEDI** school of though, they're not all knowing which is hammered over and over again in the new canon and old. Jedi only bring death when they need to, never to kill millions in an act and the jedi of the old republic were wrong to join the fight. That is why there are whole arcs about the jedi turning from peace keepers into warriors for the republic and questioning their order. Also Luke wasn't a jedi when he blew up the death star. 

Also the difference is that the bendu is using the force to attack and not enhance his senses. He is bending the force to his will to create a storm and in anger strike down the empire. If that isn't dark side then the dark side isn't the dark side anymore. 

&gt;Or you have a different understanding of the Force than what's presented in the film. TLJ lays its interpretation out pretty clearly, and to me it chimes with Lucas's ideas pretty well.

No, I have a complete understanding of the force and the only thing that was represented well was Rey drowning in the black sea which was the dark side. That was well established before the movies to be true. The force ghost and Yoda bending the will of the force to attack the tree goes directly against what Yoda said before ""We never use the force to attack, only defend"". It was like RJ saw some cool center force user shit and put it on Yoda which I can see him doing since he is well known to make things up just because they are cool and not because they make sense with the rest of the movie. 

So from that I'm just guessing, which seems to be the logical point to make with the rest of the media, is that Yoda became one with the force and finally figured out the dark and light side are two sides of the same coin. 



BUT despite all this, the fact remains that there were, and probably still are, two force users in the galaxy that use both sides of the force in canon.

Am lucrat in constructii 3-4 ani + si aproape fiecare vara de cand aveam 17 ani. Am lucrat la olimpiada din Londra, case de lux(5m+), proiecte ale guvernului si cam orice altceva iti trece prin cap.

O chestie generala e ca atunci cand il intrebi pe un roman nou venit ce stie sa faca, el iti zice ca stie sa faca orice, pune centrale, trage gaz, e electrician, face mobila, pune asfalt, construieste acoperisuri, lucreaza cu plumb/cupru/aur/vibranium si adamantiu si in general s-a nascut facand asta si pentru a face asta. Si cand ii dai un cui si un ciocan, se apuca sa bata cuiul peste ciocan. In orice companie serioasa cand vine unul si zice ""eu stiu sa fac aproape orice"" de obicei e pus sa fie salahor si sa faca ordine pe unde se lucreaza si sa care ce trebuie carat. 

Proiectele mici de casa nu prea se fac asa des cu contract, poate doar daca e ceva mai serios gen o extensie/modificari structurale/lucrat cu gaz/etc, 90% din echipe au asigurare in caz ca fac o prostie si acolo un contract verbal e o chestie destul de serioasa si nu e greu sa-i futi in caz de fac vreo prostie. Diferenta e in pret. Acolo un instalator vine cu o duba de scule si are si vreo 15-30.000 bagati in cursuri si ia 250 lire pe zi de munca, la noi vine cu o sacosa cu o cheie si o banda de teflon, dar e ieftin. La noi iti monteaza o centrala cu cateva sute de lei, acolo doar semnatura pentru inspectia centralei si circuitului e un minim de 500 de lire. 

Sunt si companii de romani care lucreaza cu prostii si fac prostii, dar astia ii iei doar daca esti prost si ieftin, altfel lumea lucreaza profi pentru ca pentru companiile mici majoritatea lucrarilor vin de la oameni care au vazut ce-ai lucrat is au prieteni la care ai lucrat. Deci reputatia e foarte, foarte importanta. 

La noi e free for all, instalatorul meu stia sa faca de toate, dar au trecut 3 saptamani si-as vrea sa-l chem inapoi sa-l intreb de ce e o teava uda, dar surpriza, e disparut(chiar daca a luat doar jumatate din bani). Am avut unul sa imi indrepte peretii prin casa si a lucrat o saptamana de la 8 dimineata la 8 seara intr-un hol si o camera mica si a cerut 2000 de lei, i-am dat 400 si i-am zis ca ii ia pe aia sau nu primeste nimic si imi plateste si materialele pentru ca si-a batut joc de timpul meu si a facut mizerie degeaba.

As an American who lived in Europe for a short amount of time (around 4 months, so enough to get a feel), some of the points brought up were fair, but were not totally accurate or out of proportion. One thing to note is that each state is different, because states have a fair amount of self-governance. And, even then, it depends on the individual. 

For the work and healthcare related issues, it’s true we don’t have those thing ensured by the government, but individuals try and bargain for better benefits, such as more vacation days, maternity/paternity leave, better health benefits, et cetera, even without unions. Although, some people can’t bargain for those things, partially because they aren’t in unions.

The gun laws are a state-by-state and place-to-place thing. Some states have strict laws, some don’t. Although shootings do happen, they are definitely not as rampant as the thread mentioned.

Politics is definitely blown out of proportion. Yes, we have a president that Europeans, and a majority of Americans, do not like. We also do have to figure out some stuff politically. But, we do have federal elections every 2 years, and we don’t have parties that are explicitly neo-nazis in office.

*Speaking exclusively to Jacob Rees-Mogg, Comment Central’s Bruce Newsome talks May, Brexit, the soul, and a potential leadership.*

Jacob Rees-Mogg is one of only a few politicians who can walk on stage during a heat wave, wearing a buttoned dark double-breasted suit, to speak for an hour in a marquee warmed by hundreds of guests, and not break a sweat. His good humour, quick wit, sharp reposts, self-deprecation, and soothing manners never falter.

Yet, despite self-possession and mindfulness, even in my private interview Jacob Rees-Mogg is open and honest about his leader (Theresa May), the future of the Conservative Party, and Brexit.

Inevitably, since he was speaking at the Chalke Valley History Festival, he was introduced flippantly as a representative from the Eighteenth Century, although he replied that he preferred the Seventeenth Century, given the “growth of parliamentary democracy” then. At times reminiscent of religious faith, his consideration of British parliamentary democracy anchors almost everything he said. This is most obvious in his views on Brexit, which he characterized as the most important constitutional change since the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and certainly a more important change than the vote to join the European Community in 1975, because now we are leaving a European Union with “fingers in every pie”.

He welcomes Brexit for “reinforcing democracy” and “reclaiming civil law.” He asserts “a fundamental difference” between the English-tradition of “common law” (derived from judicial decisions) and the continent’s grounding in Roman, or “Napoleonic law”. Everybody in the realm, even the monarch, is subject to common law, but the continental tradition is comfortable with several steps of separation between rulers and both judicial and democratic accountability. For Rees-Mogg, the British tradition is “incompatible” with the European Union.

He admits that he worries about being wrong in general, but not on the principle of “voting against European governance” of Britain. “We’re better at it ourselves.” He delivered this conclusion with rare exclamation, which earned the second loudest round of applause of the event.

The loudest applause was earned in answer to a question about how he could look young people in the face given that they will live with more of the consequences of leaving the EU. Rees-Mogg replied that he believed that young people will value the right to vote directly for all their policymakers: “You can’t vote out the European bureaucracy.” Incidentally, that questioner started off by saying that he was “much more likeable” than she had expected, which drew the loudest laughter of the evening.

The only issue that would have persuaded him to vote Remain in 2016 would have been a significant risk to the union with Scotland; subsequently, Brexit has strengthened the union. The union with Northern Ireland remains just as strong and the border can be resolved more easily than the fashionable discourse pretends.

Everything since the referendum has confirmed his confidence in Brexit, including the EU’s intransigence and the performance of Britain’s economy against most forecasts. “The EU is the risk to our competitiveness” because it piles on regulations that are focused on controlling competition within the EU instead of promoting competitiveness with the rest of the world. He prefers a “free market” to a “protectionist European Union.”

More reports are confirming that May is telling her Cabinet to unite around a “soft Brexit,” but that would be unacceptable to Rees-Mogg. When I asked him to clarify what sort of Brexit he would find unacceptable, he said that he would oppose any commitment to pay £39 billion without a specified trade deal. But surely, I replied, that is what May had already agreed in December 2017. This was the only time I saw Rees-Mogg rattled all day. He evaded the link.

Is he a populist? Yes, he said, if you mean he is offering people what is best for them. Politicians gain votes by promising people what they want – often this means promising what can’t be delivered (such as more spending on everything) or what politicians have no intention of delivering. Populism is a rebellion against choices that are best for the elite. “The people make the choice, politicians offer the choice.”  “I was born into the establishment; that’s how I know how rotten it is” – at least since it was taken over by “the liberal metropolitan elite.” During debates over the government’s EU Withdrawal Bill, “the condescension in the House of Lords was absolutely extraordinary”. If they had better understood the outside world, they would have predicted Brexit.

￼
 
Without prompting, Rees-Mogg reversed the elitist blame of the voter for the decline in voter turnout. He blamed it on the elite offering poor choices. Since turnout declined in the general elections of 1997 and 2001, implicitly the ultimate blame attaches to Tony Blair, who won those elections, but also John Major as Conservative Party leader in 1997, and his successor William Hague through the general election of 2001. The blame might extend to the subsequent leaders Iain Duncan Smith and Michael Howard, who led the party without a return to government.

What is his view of the party’s leadership into the future? Coincidentally, today Conservative Home’s editor reported a new survey of members and suggested “a sense that change is coming sooner rather than later – that Theresa May might not be prime minister by this time next year, or even earlier, and that the time has come to think more probingly about a replacement.” Rees-Mogg had either topped the monthly poll, or come second to “other,” since the general election in 2017, although now Rees-Mogg is fourth, behind Sajid Javid (the Home Secretary), Michael Gove (the Environment Secretary), and “other”.

Rees-Mogg said that May “is doing very well considering the shocking majority” she earned at the 2017 election. This was a clever way of blaming May while formally empathizing. He went further with a back-handed compliment. He asked the audience to think of the party conference in October 2017, when “she was losing her voice and the stage was collapsing,” but she carried on. He said that the scene reminded him of the film “Carry on up the Khyber” (1968), when Sid James portrayed an officer unphased in his personal ablutions during enemy attacks. Rees-Mogg ground out the analogy with untypical relish, then he concluded calmly that he valued the principle of “doing your duty, and I think duty is the word that best describes Mrs. May.”

Rees-Mogg says that he supports May as leader, but clearly this is partisan not personal. “The Tory Party gets itself in trouble whenever it conspires against its leader,” although “that doesn’t mean you should agree with every policy.” He said that she may not be your choice of leader, but “she is the leader of the party, and loyalty is the Conservative Party’s secret weapon.”

I asked him to clarify an apparent contradiction: he praises parliamentary democracy for the voter’s capacity to directly elect and deselect representatives, while he was denying himself his capacity as a Member of Parliament to deselect his party leader. He clarified that he was retaining the “right” as a Member of Parliament, but his “choice” is to support his party leader.

Yet, Rees-Mogg has no hesitation in discussing who should replace Theresa May.

He said that since Stanley Baldwin, the “formbook” has been for a former Foreign Secretary, Chancellor, or Home Secretary to become prime minister. Only four Prime Ministers have ever become PM without previously holding Cabinet positions, of which two are Tony Blair and David Cameron. He clearly regrets both their premierships: he was explicit about Blair; in another context (his defence of our monarch as head of state), he added the vision of a President Cameron as almost as disagreeable as a President Blair.

In 2016, Rees-Mogg had offered support to Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, and Andrea Leadsom successively as their bids collapsed. Now, Johnson appears to be Rees-Mogg’s favourite. Explicitly, he said that “Boris is a brilliant foreign secretary” because he represents Britain’s interests abroad. Since that is what he urges May to do as premier, logically Johnson would suit him better as premier.

Curiously, Rees-Mogg undermined many of the candidates by raising the advantage of maturity. This may have been intended as a dig at Blair and Cameron, who became premiers in their forties. Rees-Mogg said that we should welcome a candidate aged 70, but I could not discover whom he might have in mind (Sajid Javid is 48; Michael Gove is nearly 51; Boris is 54; Amber Rudd is nearly 55; Liam Fox is pushing 57; Theresa May is 61; Rees-Mogg is barely 49).

Rees-Mogg says that he is “not a realistic prospect” for election to leader, because he must be elected by MPs, whatever his popularity with others. He seems to have social conservatism in mind, which is rooted explicitly in his Catholicism. When asked about the influence of his Catholicism on his politics, he said the only fundamental influence was “the value of every soul,” which influences his politics on human life, but being a Catholic “doesn’t mean I have a hotline to the Vatican” on other issues – such as how to vote on Heathrow’s third runway.

What I am saying is that the Czech Resistance movements started an uprising in the city and countryside as the Americans and Soviets approached Prague. Stationed near Prague was a contingent of German Army Eastern European Volunteers of the Russian Liberation Army. Most of these were anti-Bolshevik / Soviet Russians who were eventually allowed to form an Army under Germany's control. These guys joined the German Army for a myriad of reasons, but a lot of it was a mix of opportunism (to get out of POW Camps after being captured while they were in the Red Army, which were essentially death camps for Soviet POWs), and hatred for Communism / Soviet Union; especially in the Ukrainian units, which suffered the ""Holodomor"" (genocide by starvation) at the hands of Stalin in the 1930s, losing millions of people. And in the Russian units many hated the Soviet Union for suffering brought on their families during and after the Russian Civil War (many of the Russians in the RLA were former ""whites"").  Many rightfully still hated Stalin and the USSR and saw the Germans as liberators (they were very wrong). As the war progressed and ethnic ""Aryan"" German soldiers were dying in the meat grinder that was World War II (namely the Eastern Front) the Nazi officials lessened ethnic  restrictions on joining the Wehrmacht and the Waffen SS. They sought out help from where they could get it in all but a few categories were allowed to join the German Military: Jews, Gypsies, ethnic Poles (ethnic Germans living in Poland were allowed to join), Czechs etc... otherwise most Europeans were allowed to join. So a lot of Eastern Europeans volunteered, especially when they saw how horrible treatment the Nazis were bringing on the local populaces. Better to join them than fall victim to them was on many minds. 

Now these Eastern European former Soviet citizens fighting for Nazi Germany realized their goose was cooked. The Nazis were about to lose the war, and they (both Germans and Foreign Volunteers) knew that if they were captured by the Red Army they would, be beaten, tortured and eventually killed at worst, or at best shipped off to  a Gulag in Siberia. So what could they do?


They decided to mutiny against the ethnic German Military units and help fight along side the Czech Resistance. Why?

In their minds this action of throwing off their Nazi chains and fighting against the Germans (even though they joined the Germans Military)  would ingratiate themselves to the Western Allies, and allow them some leniency when the Americans rolled in to town. All similar collaborationist units wanted to fall in to Western Allied hands and not Soviet hands, because they figured they would be given better treatment and rights as POWs. This was not an uncommon occurrence at the end of the war, where foreign volunteer units fighting for Germany mutinied against the Germans and openly fought them in hopes of currying favor with the Western Allies - so as to be granted leniency and not be repatriated to the Soviets. 

However, as these Eastern European Wehrmacht Mutineers joined forces with the Czechs to rid themselves of the Germans, thinking Patton and his US troops would roll in to Prague, they didn't realize that politics had forced a pissed off Patton to halt his advances towards Prauge and leave it to the Red Army. 


Some units tried fighting towards American lines to surrender to them, others along with Czech Resistance fighters went under ground or fled, while some decided to stay with German die hard SS units and fight on in the hinterlands. 

The ""Liberation"" of Prague was very complex and very tragic for thr Czech people.


Now the Cezchs did not want to be under Nazi rule. They suffered immensely, especially after.the assassination of RH. They hated the Nazis. But they didn't want to trade one oppressor for another, and wanted to determine their own freedom and destiny (which was democratic not Communist). But the powers that be left Czechoslovakia  to fall under Soviet control, just like Poland (which also didn't want to be Communist either). But politics were complex and Stalin needed to be placated.

And as less people are required to produce the food, clothing, and material goods we need to live our lives comfortably - more people can pursue training and advancement in the arts and sciences.

This development is separate from the economic system it exists within, and is the product of human minds and hands. Not the flow of capital and money. That flow conditions, shapes and limits the advancements made, however, as we can see in the sciences and arts today. Under a system driven by profit, only those development which are profitable will be encouraged. Without the money to survive, much less fund your research and work, you can't pursue certain things at all!

Even just two hundred years ago, we lived in a world where most people labored their lives as farmers and ranchers. Urbanization developed alongside capitalism. In Medieval Europe, 90% of the population labored just to produce the food and basic necessaries of life for the other 10%. Thanks to advances in agriculture like crop rotation, pesticide and better strains, fewer people were required to produce the same amount of food, however. And because of the massive deaths of the Black Plague - workers were in higher demand, and could in turn make more extensive demands of their bosses! 

This went alongside the formation of the guilds which empowered artisans (though they had deep flaws), the development of national and church-run school systems which brought literacy to many landless workers, and the development of science and even more technology! We now live in a world where only 3% of the population is required to produce 90% of our food.

Those gains are what ultimately enabled the growth of industrial capitalism out of the agrarian feudalism that had existed prior to it, and the refocusing of society's resources on commodity production, of things like clothes and toys and cars.

And we've seen something very similar through the 20th century and the High-Tech Revolution.

Because of developments in computers and robotics, fewer factory workers are necessary to produce those goods needed for our modern lifestyles. Factory work and human labor are still in use in much of the third world, but that is a result of the economic conditioning. Not technological growth.

Profit-seeking will use whatever the cheapest production method is. And when labor in a third world country is cheaper, because of differences in the cost-of-living, it will be used. Even at the expense of those workers own safety and lives.

Because of that combination of outsourcing and automation, though we have seen a move in the first world towards a service-sector based economy. Because we are now at a time when the vast majority of our hands aren't needed for the production of necessities at all.

This trend will continue under socialism, but profit-seeking won't exist as a driving force because we will be living in a post-profit world. Most existing and formerly-existing socialist states came to be in much less developed economies, and at a time when factory-labor still dominated. What a socialist state in the previously-first-world would look like, we don't know.

I'd say that as soon as you are more interested in ensuring that these people end up in Europe than you are in rescuing them, you become part of the problem.

The reality is of course very simple: The only way to stop people from getting on these boats and thus risking their lives and needing rescue is to eliminate the need for them to get on boats. You can either do this by ferrying everybody who desires into Europe, in effect completely opening the borders, or you can prevent anyone from landing in Europe thus making such a journey pointless, in effect completely closing the borders. This rescuing of people at sea and depositing them in Europe, how noble it might be, is in the end part of the problem by encouraging people to get on the boats.

In all the cases, the west prefer islamisized and weak countries who are not gonna put an economic or military competition to them, and they don't like democracies, they prefer dictatorships where they can speak with a single leader and secure their interests for decades, with a president changing every four years that would be difficult. And it's not a secret that before trump, the west did nothing to stop ISIS, they waited for them to take down assad before moving, turkey opened the borders for them to join syria, France gave the cement for the undergrounds, saudi and qatar gave money, UK and USA gave satellite data. And ben laden probably didn't even plan the 9/11, he has a video where he says that he is innocent. The west reached a level where islam became a tool for them. If they wanted, terrorism would disappear, but they can't abandon a so powerful tool ,in the near futur, they will use it against china, what’s happening in Myanmar is a preparation triggered by the saudis, and now they're creating a huge network of 500 mosques in Bangladesh to recruit jihadis from the rohingyas who lost everything.

All this, is concerning the islamic world. For the west itself, things are different, those western powers who control islam overseas, doesn't control it in their own countries, because overseas, the ones playing are away from the radars, secret services, NATO, multinationals using crazy networks of bank accounts, in the inside, things are different, politicians are watching, the law and freedoms are watching, islam is related to social phenomenon and culture, no games no tricks, the west brought muslims from poor countries because the industry needs workforce, but they can't control it, you can't control what parents are gonna tell their children in their mother tongues, or what the imam is gonna say in paki or arabic, politicians just put them in closed neighborhoods, and let them between themselves. What i see is that saudis are financing extremists in europe, trying to convert people from the muslim community, i'm sure they're acting under US orders, but why is the US doing this, European countries agree with this or not ? is this a plan to weaken europe or is it planned by European themselves to start the cosmopolite project of a world without borders, what is see is that not every European country agree with what’s happening..... For turkey, i'm sure that no one is controlling them, they just want to spread influence, in all the cases, what's happening is bad, I feel that they lost control, and the people who’re suffering are the apostates and seculars living inside this closed culture. You said that Muslims cant’ act just by hearing a hadith, yes, but they’re forced to agree with the content, mo took a six years, they must agree with it, and agreeing with it will give a probability seeing it happening. Mo stoned, maybe they will not stone, but they must agree with it, that’s exactly what the video is about. I'm just afraid that the number of people thinking like that will start to grow more and more, even if the law prohibits some behaviors, if the neighborhood is entirely inhabited by people agreeing with the behavior, they will force it. And the minorities of the neighborhood will suffer, this is not even theoretical this is happening. So speakers and imams need to secularize people, preach a lighter and tolerant version of islam, if politicians lost control, this is what they must start doing, if they have some kind of conspiracy plan for europe, that i can't speak about but they're wrong if they think that multiculturalism must be forced this way without careful planning.

&gt;-Where would you move to learn about Dutch culture, or to do your best to become an honorary dutchman?

Any small village outside of the Randstad area. Larger cities are very international and it's tempting to stay in an English speaking expat bubble there. 

-Where would you go to make a comfortable living in tech?

Amsterdam or other cities in Randstad area or Eindhoven.

&gt;-Is Amsterdam all it's cracked up to be?

If you ask me, an Amsterdammer: yes. It's beautiful, it has a lot to offer culturally (art, music, etc), i't small enough to feel cozy but internatiional enough to feel cosmopolitan. For some reason Amsterdam gets a lot of hate from people from other parts of the country. Possible reason: they only know the tourist trap part of the inner city. Big downside: shortage of housing and ridiculous prices.

&gt;Is the weather comparable to where I am? 

I checked, and temperature wise it's not that different except we have quite a bit of rain all seasons.

Maybe not.

Caretakers in Europe, Japan, Latin America etc. manage to do this just fine, and the vast majority of men live and die with their penises in the condition they were born with, and are thankful they didn't have part of their penis cut off as soon as they were a baby. What's wrong with America?

Are you sure he HAD to get circumcised? Was complete surgical removal of this body part the only way to prevent future problems? Given how rampant forced retractions of children are, do you think it's likely there was another way of preventing these things other than surgical amputation?

&gt;If you think circumcision is some obtuse religious practice, all I can say is best of luck not having your children vaccinated either. Science!

Well when you look at that map this entire discussion thread has revolved around and how it's most prevalent in regions where it is basically an obtuse religious practice (or the history of the procedure until the mid 19th century), I think that's a perfectly valid conclusion.

*Putin's Asymmetric Assault on Democracy in Russia and Europe: Implications for US National Security - A Minority Staff Report Prepared for the use of the Committee on Foreign Relations - US Senate, 115th Congress, 2nd Session, January 10, 2018*

&gt;The Nordic states continue to raise their populations’ awareness of and resiliency to Kremlin disinformation campaigns. In advance of a military exercise in Sweden, which also included the other Nordic states, the Baltics, and the United States, the defense ministries of Sweden and Denmark released a joint statement announcing their intention to team up to deter Russian government cyberattacks and disinformation operations. And **Sweden, which will hold elections in 2018, has begun ramping up its defenses against disinformation operations through its Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB). The agency has picked up on fake news stories that push narratives claiming that Sweden is a war zone and the rape capital of Europe, and that it has banned Christmas lights and the eating of bacon on trains.** Echoing the U.S. experts hired by Finland, the head of MSB’s global analysis and monitoring section, Mikael Tofvesson, has emphasized that the MSB’s strategy is not to fight fire with fire, noting that:

&gt;**‘‘It’s like mudwrestling a pig. You’ll both get dirty, but the pig will think it’s quite nice. This plays into their hands, whereas for us getting dirty is just a pain. Instead, we have to try to stay clean and focus on the part of our society that has to work: democracy and freedom of expression, to make sure that giving the citizens correct information becomes our best form of resistance.’’** (page 111)

&gt; Please correct this garbled gibberish into something remotely comprehensible and coherent. Also, next time produce a working URL.

I was typing on my phone.  Again you're attacking what was clearly a typing error as if it's relevant.  

But while we're on this sort of attack, lets list logical fallacies and point out how you've used them

* Ad Hominem Fallacy: You've attacked and mislabelled me throughout

* Straw Man:  You've attacked things that I don't even claim.

* Appeal to emotion:  I've already addressed this in part 1

* False Dilemma/False Dichotomy:  Again related to the labelling, you lump anyone who voted for Brexit in the same category, this is what they are, they can't be anything else.

* Slippery Slope:  The whole remain debate past the point of agreeing a deal and actually getting out of Brexit isn't addressed. It's just plain catastrophe and disaster from thereon out.  No, it's probably not.  It'll be costly at first of course, which we'll no doubt bounce back from as countries usually do from a period of economic difficulty, and have done before.  As a nation we're perfectly capable of not going into a horrendous spiral with no way out.  The doom isn't real.

* Hasty Generalization:  Fits in with the black and white thinking in regards to who voted for Brexit and your inability to not lump me in with your fictional generalisations.  I'd also include your idea that anyone on the right supports Brexit and is a certain way to the point of having tell-tale signs.

* Causal Fallacy:  I know nothing about science apparently. You had no information to support that notion but pulled it out of your ass anyway.

* Appeal to Authority: You do provide links in the final section, but as you have throughout, failed to provide any reasoning as to why they are correct.  If you provide links to ""experts"" (I mean come on, the open democracy link is a joke) that are throwing mights and maybes without any real conclusion about what will happen, then what are you actually debating?  How does it address any of my points?  You're using names to hide the fact that you're not actually using the points to address anything I've said specifically.




And onto my final point.

&gt; &gt; However were not going to lose the countrys wealth overnight
&gt;
&gt; This is a straw man hyperbole, though.
 
Ok, since you insist on attacking the wording rather than the clear meaning of it, I'll rephrase. I don't believe there's any doom scenario.
Sure a hard Brexit is going to be more costly, but I don't believe it would spell doom for the UK.  As in your linked articles, some cry out doom the end of the world, others say the same thing without the dramatics.  There's lots of coulds and mays, and if this then that scenarios that may not even come to be.  

While this list is wishy washy (again a list of coulds and mights)

https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/brexit-what-next-reasons-to-be-positive-eu-referendum-jeremy-corbyn-a7104016.html

(Notice here how I use the link to make a specific point)
A valid point in there is that the UK can make of itself what it chooses to make of itself, in the sense that there are new opportunities that come out of it and they'll be what we make of them. (And not in the sense of undoing changes that the EU influenced in the country, thought I'd point that out since I'd kind of expect you to respond that way at this point)

I won't respond again.  I mostly wanted to quote your own text and point out what a complete hypocritical lying shithead you've been all while pompously maintaining that you're more educated and have been a model debater.


And because experience with your responses leads me to believe that you'd just flat out deny the last section, one more quote.
Along with a reminder that I've so far backed up every point I've made with a quote, and shown you to have lied in multiple instances already.

&gt; You don't get a productive debate when honesty is an alien concept to you. Once you rediscover that and no longer make claims lacking any basis in fact or which completely defy common sense, you'll be able to productively debate again. 
&gt; You know very little to completely nothing about Brexit, and the gap between your lack of knowledge and your arrogant rhetoric is extremely noticeable. I'd advise you to refrain from commenting on this topic.

I'll admit that I only know of you what you've said to me.  But my god in such a small amount of time you've led me to believe that you're an arrogant liar who cares little about polite interaction with others.  I hope that this exchange isn't a good representation of you for your own sake and the sake of people who meet you.

Change in regulations moves very slowly in India (although the authorities are starting to finally wake up to the fact that they have to react quickly to not be left behind in the Blockchain tech race), and the way of doing business and the sense of professionalism may be different to the way your expect (if living in North America, Europe, Australia etc).  

The base of tech engineers / talent at Nucleus Vision's disposal is a major factor I believe in what will deliver success for Nucleus Vision. In investing in Nucleus, I am investing in India's overall adoption of blockchain. I'm also investing in Nucleus Vision being a first-mover in India, and in the team and strategy  - aligning with the Indian government and top retailers (to begin).  

Nucleus Vision are co-hosting the largest blockchain conference in Hyderabad with the government at the beginning of August. This is smart.

A. Artistic genius isn't real, it is a myth introduced by Giorgio Vasari, and perpetuated by the European art academy. Art is taught, it is a skill, no one starts drawing like that without years of practice. The idea that you can spontaneously start doing it is as absurd as picking up a violin for the first time and playing a flawless Mozart concerto.

B. All of the images shown have characteristic features of drawings made from photograph-e.g expressions &amp; poses that would be impossible for the models to hold over a few hours, distinct droplets of water/sweat, etc. Nothing wrong with that, plenty of artists work that way, yet in the video the boy is shown improvising from a live model, because that is how laymen imagine all artists work--so already the actual technique is hidden in favor of a layman stereotype. 

C.   The boy is fake-drawing throughout the video, he draws a circle, and then immediately the video cuts to him drawing on top of an already well-defined face. If you look, you will notice that the circle he draws doesn't even match up with the position or shape of the head that results. He is literally cross-hatching over a pre-sketched face by another artist. The image that he is producing doesn't look anything like the finished images either, they are not built up from the sort of rough cross-hatching we see him apply--he is laying down thick, distinct lines, while all the finished works don't have any such lines visible, and nothing covering them up either--they should still be visible when the drawing is finished.

TL:DR The drawings are by his teacher, who appears in the video. The teacher is very talented, but people don't generally care about talented adult artists, thus the false premise.

So while you're listening to what others say about him, I'm enjoying skyrocketing employment, an incredible stock market, the destruction of ISIS, peace talks beginning on the Korean peninsula, strong border control, and an end to trade deals that unfairly target the US. 

&gt;He is leaving trade deals left and right.

Which has he left? Why? Please provide examples for this claim, as well as his reasoning for it. Could these trade deals have been unfair for America? (Hint: Research 'tariffs', and how high they are for each country).

&gt;He is backstabbing his the US's closest allies by suddenly imposing tariffs under the pretense of ""national security"". 

He says he wants to end tariffs. ALL tariffs. 

https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/09/politics/trump-g7-tariffs-trade/index.html

But since other countries refuse, he's willing to bump the US's tariffs up to match those of our so-called ""allies"". 

Also regarding national security: Are you referring to the metal tariffs imposed on Canada?

Do you know what Chinesium is, and how this inferior metal is bought from China by third parties in Canada, repackaged as NAFTA-Brand metal, and sold to America? Do you know how much metal is used by our military?

&gt;Furthermore, he seems hellbent on diving and screwing over the EU and Europe as much as humanly possible.

How? The euro-skeptic movement predates Trump, and has been exacerbated by the EU itself. Refugee crisis? The Greek Debt Crisis? The recent internet legislation?

Methinks the EU is screwing itself.

&gt;He wants to weaken Europe, which is exactly what Putin wants.

Why does Putin want this? What motive does he have to cripple such a valuable trade partner?

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26436291

&gt;Trump has also made a bunch of statements to reduce the US role NATO and especially their presence in Europe.

http://money.cnn.com/2016/07/08/news/nato-summit-spending-countries/index.html

Seems America is, once again, calling out the bullshit of other countries and trade groups. 

&gt;The US is present there only because of Russia, and now they're taking away support in that region?

Again, you equate words with actions. Show me where he's removed support. He's *threatened* it, just as you'd threaten to kick out a dead-beat kid if they refused to get a job. If other countries refuse to match the agreed-upon spending, then yeah, he should pull out. It's their asses on the line, not ours.

&gt;Furthermore, while doing all of this he is holding a meeting with Putin as we speak, instead of his allies in the EU and Canada, which he is currently blackmailing.

He's not blackmailing them. I don't even know if you know what that word means. Is he *threatening* them? Sure. Is he using incriminating evidence to make them act as he wants? No. 

Regarding the meeting: He's already met with them at a little meeting called ""The G7""; a meeting Russia wasn't invited to attend. Now given the fact Russia is soooo massive and such an important global power, I'd say it's a good idea for us to meet with them on peaceful terms; especially since they have enough nukes to glass the planet.

In conclusion: You confuse words with reality and are lost in a conspiracy theory that's sent you adrift in an ocean of nonsense. You assume America trying to fight for its own self interests is somehow malicious, even though the countries negatively affected by such an act are ones that have taken advantage of the US for decades. The tariffs he's fighting against were put in place in the post-war world to keep the decimated Europe competitive with America, but since they're no longer a destroyed continent, it's completely within Trump's right to negotiate better trade on behalf of the country he was elected to govern.

False,SupaZupa,1508140408.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_c6xnv6z,"&gt;Labour has demanded Theresa May ban the “cruel and inhumane” practice of gay conversion therapy as the government prepares to publish its major LGBT+ action plan.

&gt;The party’s call comes as the prime minister is set to launch her proposals later this week, alongside the world’s largest survey of LGBT+ people, detailing the responses of 108,000 individuals in the UK.

&gt;Labour claims the controversial practice – sometimes referred to as “gay cure” – which aims to change or alter an individual’s sexual orientation has “spread fear and hatred” in society and calls for legislation from ministers to make it illegal.

&gt;Several organisations, including NHS England, the British Psychological Society, and the Royal College of Psychiatrists published a “memorandum of understanding” in 2014 describing conversion therapy as “unethical and potentially harmful”.

&gt;Despite campaigns and attempts by backbench MPs to ban the practice there are currently no laws against the practice and the LGBT+ charity, Stonewall, suggests there is evidence that individuals continue to experience the therapies. 

&gt;The organisation’s “Unhealthy Attitudes” report, published in 2015, claimed that one in 10 health and social care staff have witnessed colleagues express the belief that sexual orientation can be “cured”.

&gt;In 2016, Malta became the first European country to outlaw conversion therapy after the country’s parliament voted unanimously for a bill which detailed fines and jail sentences for any individual found guilty of trying to “change, repress or eliminate a person’s sexual orientation, gender identity and/or gender expression”.

&gt;Labour’s Dawn Butler, the shadow equalities minister, said: “We must finally see an end to cruel and inhumane conversion therapies, which have been allowed to spread fear and hatred in our society for far too long.”

&gt;Ahead of the publication of the LGBT+ action plan, the party also urges ministers to reinstate cuts to the administrative equalities budget, which has almost halved since 2010.

&gt;According to a written ministerial statement last month, the Government Equalities Office received £9.5m in 2010-11 and this fell to £4.6m in 2017-18. In the current financial year, £5.3m has been earmarked by the Treasury for the equalities office.

&gt;Its programme budget, however, rose from £6.2m in 2010-11 to £9.6m in 2017-18 and an additional £10m was allocated to the budget for the centenary and returners project to spend between 2017-20. The former is to celebrate 100 years of voting rights for women while the latter is to support people returning to work after long breaks.

&gt;Ms Butler added: “The Conservatives have slashed funding for equalities in half since 2010. How can Theresa May claim to be tackling burning injustices, while cutting the funding to achieve this?

&gt;“The government’s action plan must address all forms of discrimination and inequality facing LGBT+ people. This will require resources, and a reversal of their own policies.

&gt;“Theresa May must stop dragging her feet on updating the Gender Recognition Act. It’s a disgrace that the Government’s consultation hasn’t started a year after it was promised.

&gt;Speaking in May, the prime minister said the action plan will present “concrete steps” to improve the lives of LGBT+ people in Britain, adding: “I want to help make us a country where no one feels the need to hide who they are or who they love.”

False,Joaoseinha,1356808645.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_a1f3h,"I'd say ESO. It does work for some of the things you've said.

You can do a lot of different stuff in ESO, from going on a stealing spree (my personal favorite way to make money as a member of the Thieves Guild) to questing to doing delves or dolmens, dungeons, PvP and so on.

It's not set in the Middle Ages, being set in the Elder Scrolls universe, but depending on your knowledge of Elder Scrolls lore you'll know some provinces are more ""familiar"" than others. A character in the Daggerfall Covenant spends a large portion of their time in High Rock, which aside from Cyrodiil is the province closest to a Medieval Europe setting.

Community's also not small by any means (it's definitely a top 5 MMO in population right now), but I'd say it's friendly enough and friendlier than most MMOs' communities. Plus, considering the world is de-leveled the players are all spread out so you'll not run into places absolutely crammed with people most of the time, though you'll certainly run into people in the main cities of each area like Vulkhel Guard in Auridon.

Gameplay's debatable, some people don't like the combat. For me, the combat's fine. If you've ever played Skyrim, it's basically a mix between that and traditional MMO combat with some action combat aspects like dodging. It's not the most mindblowing combat system out there but it does the job just fine in my opinion.

The professions are simple to learn but they are pretty interesting in my opinion. Once again, if you've played an Elder Scrolls game you'll know sort of how it works. Alchemy for example, you have to go around looking for all sorts of ingredients from mushrooms to herbs and flowers. As you make potions you discover different traits for each of the ingredients, and eventually you start figuring out most of each ingredient's traits which allows you to mix them in optimal ways (like knowing three ingredients all with the same 3 traits to create a potion that uses those three traits, like a HP/Stamina/Magicka restoring potion). 

Still fairly new to the game but other crafting professions have similar things. In armor and weapon crafting professions you can craft different styles of armor or weapon. For example, you craft iron armor in orcish style, but later on you might find a crafting motif (basically a new crafting style) for ancient elven gear which allows you to craft iron armor in ancient elf style, but as you progress your craft you learn how to craft armor with better metals and so on. You also have different traits you can craft into the armor when you make it. This is basically what adds an element of complexity into crafting. Along with that, after you craft a piece of armor you can have it enchanted by someone with a good enchanting skill (or do it yourself, provided you've leveled that crafting skill high enough to make good glyphs). So this ties into another profession which uses runes found in the world to craft Glyphs, which are basically enchantments you apply to gear.

That's just a fairly basic description of how some of the crafting works, but I'm by no means an expert. I'm still pretty new to the game, but I'm having a blast so far.

The music is nice in my opinion, but it's pretty subjective.

There's plenty to explore though, that much is a fact. The game takes place in the continent of Tamriel, and as of writing this post a bit over half the continent is explorable. The world isn't entirely seamless, you can walk from area to area but there are loading screens separating the greater areas.

Going back into the exploring thing though, this is where the game shines the most in my opinion. This game is a dream come true for fans of the Elder Scrolls but even newcomers to the universe will be happy with the diverse places they can explore. 

I think it's easier to show the diversity of the world through pictures though, so here's a picture of a few different provinces which all have different cultures, home races, climates and architecture:

[The province of High Rock is pretty similar to Medieval Europe, with warring kingdoms.](https://image.cemmos.net/f533a70aa0942b6fedc52733b348470c86222e0c?url=http://static.elderscrollsonline.com/assets/img/interactive-map/screenshots/Interactive_Map_Stormhaven.jpg)

[Hammerfell is mostly deserts and such, it's located close to High Rock and around half the province is currently explorable](https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/cms/2016/02/5f292b531ff36aba59a2595a1a1971c1.jpg)

[The main island of the Summerset Isles, home of the high elves.](https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/cms/2018/03/d0ff82eabd2a82657064ad835759e02c.jpg)

As for the latter, for group activities you have plenty of things such as PvP, group dungeons, world bosses, trials, dolmens and so on. Questing in my opinion is better done solo and for solo activities you also have things like Delves (basically instanced mini-dungeons that you can run solo or with other random people). Even public dungeons and world bosses can be solo'd later on depending on your build from what I hear.

Post came out much bigger than expected but oh well. Personally I'm sad I didn't get on the ESO train sooner so if this helps even one person give the game a chance I'm happy.

The July Crisis was a series of interrelated diplomatic and military escalations among the major powers of Europe in the summer of 1914 that was the penultimate cause of World War I. The crisis began on June 28, 1914, when Gavrilo Princip, a Serbian and Yugoslavic partisan, assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne. A complex web of alliances, coupled by miscalculations by many leaders that war was in their best interests or that a general war would not occur, resulted in a general outbreak of hostilities among every major European nation in early August 1914.

Austria-Hungary viewed the irredentist movements of South Slavs, as promoted by Serbia, to be a threat to the unity of the nation. Following the assassination, Austria sought to inflict a military blow on Serbia to demonstrate strength and so Serbia would be more cautious about supporting Yugoslavic nationalism.

O país conheceu um crescimento económico apreciável, acima da média europeia, o que fez subir a popularidade de Cavaco Silva.

Paralelamente foi feita uma reforma fiscal, que introduziu o IRS e o IRC, reformaram-se as leis laborais e agrárias e liberalizou-se a comunicação social, de que resultou a abertura da televisão à iniciativa privada e, consequentemente, numa maior liberdade e independência da informação.

Coincidindo com o abrandamento da actividade económica, os últimos anos do XII Governo, ficaram também marcados pela contestação social às reformas do «cavaquismo».

A fitting quote from Robert Wright's 2001 book *Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny*:

&gt; This is one irony of globalization. The impetus behind it is strong largely because individual states see their long-term interest lies in plugging into the system. But when the system hits a downturn, they would be better off if somehow they could magically become less plugged in—temporarily, at least. Modern China survived the early ravages of the 1997 Asian financial crisis in good shape partly because its currency was not easily convertible into other currencies. Even so, China stuck to its plans for convertibility, because in the long run you're better off plugged in.

&gt; China, of all nations, should know. Its epic mistake—the mistake that got it labeled an underachiever—was unplugging from the system beginning in the late fourteenth century. The consequences of this, a single political decision, have ever since been taken as some deep anti-modern streak in the Asian character.

&gt; The unplugging came during the Ming dynasty, which reigned from 1368 to 1644. When the Ming vanquished the Mongols, it was in theory a glorious moment for China: renewed native control after a century of barbarian rule. But since these particular barbarians had been a gateway to global commerce, the truth was more complicated. The Mongols still controlled trade routes in central Asia, but were now less enthusiastic about using them to channel commerce toward China. Besides, the Ming rulers weren't big on free trade. Ever fearful of incursion, they constricted overland commerce in iron, arms, even textiles, lest these things empower barbarian neighbors yet again. As if to provide future historians with a nice symbol for a siege mentality, Ming emperors built the Great Wall of China.

&gt; The lack of overland trade needn't, by itself, have been devastating. There was always the sea. But Ming rulers proved touchy about contact not just with barbarians, but with aliens of a manifestly refined variety. […] The irony of this isolationism is that during the early Ming period the Chinese were king of the seas. […]

&gt; The reasons for China's withdrawal are much debated. […] The historian John King Fairbank concluded simply that ""anti-commercialism and xenophobia won, and China retired from the world scene."" […] The historian Peter Perdue sees China consciously shifting resources from one vast project—ocean voyages that had shown little profit—to another vast project: building the Great Wall to keep barbarians at bay. […]

&gt; Whatever the cause for China's withdrawal, the timing was bad. For centuries, China had been a big exporter of good ideas, and western Europe a big importer. Now, just as Europe's social brain was really humming, China opted out of the exchange.",True,False,False,,0,1530502559,,False,0,e1n084n,False,t3_8vdlp6,False,t1_e1mj50g,/r/politics/comments/8vdlp6/a_leaked_trump_bill_to_blow_up_the_wto/e1n084n/,,1535568572,50,False,True,False,politics,t5_2cneq,r/politics,public,

False,YouHaveToGoHome,1483428349.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_143nc6,"&gt;Don’t you think trump has to reduce legal immigration to balance out all of the illegal immigration that goes on? 

No. Legal immigration, asylum/refugee resettlement, and amnesty/tolerance for illegal immigration serve different purposes. Legal immigration is designed around our economic needs and basically serves as our bid for the best talent (y'all have seen the test scores; don't kid yourself that our native labor force is the best) and cheap labor. What we do around the other two forms of migration is essentially our humanitarian mission. While too much immigration can strain a country's resources and cause cultural tension, the US is nowhere near this level. From 1870-1900, the US saw nearly half a million immigrants per year over a native population of around 60 million, while today the US has around one million immigrants a year over a native population of 350 million; that's a two-third reduction per capita (if you think we have ""too many people"", the US has doubled its population since 1960, has 2.5x the land area of the EU and 3/5 the population, and has 1/5 the population of China, an economic powerhouse, in almost double the land area.) Despite the fact that the population of illegal immigrants [has decreased by about one million people](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/27/5-facts-about-illegal-immigration-in-the-u-s/) since 2007 due to the recession, the Trump administration has advocated for cutting legal immigration numbers by half. To say that the Trump administration can use this to curb hundreds of thousands of legal immigrants per year is ridiculous. 

I'm of the opinion that we should be increasing legal immigration in order to support our native population and remain competitive in the global economy. On the first point, fertility rates are falling and rural America is graying as young people seek economic opportunities and higher quality of life in the urban areas. This mean quite a lot of towns [filled with elderly people who don't have anyone to take care of them or provide services.](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/06/the-graying-of-rural-america/485159/) We should be using legal immigration as a source of labor to take care of these people and rejuvenate the towns. On the second point, we need to be grabbing as much labor talent as we can from other countries in order to remain competitive with China. As someone who works in finance and tech, it's scary how rapidly China has advanced on machine learning, fabrication, material science, biotech, and consumer electronics either through R&amp;D or stealing from foreign companies; the majority of machine learning and material science papers are now published in China. We're lucky China has decided to focus inward rather than outward for development -- for now. Think, with 5x the population of the US, China's education system only needs to be 1/5 as good as the American one in order for it to realize an equivalent class of scientists, artists, and entrepreneurs. We should be going into brain drain mode HARD in the same way we competed for German scientists with the Soviet Union after WWII.

Fun Fact, he declared it illegaly, because there were 1.25 million Aboriginal Australians that he conveniently decided to ignore because they weren't working the land in the European sense (fences, cleared fields). But they did work the land, they cultivated the bush, by planting fruit trees along the trail between settlements, by growing yams on the banks of rivers, making bread out of Bogong Moth flour, having established huntings seasons so that they didn't over hunt different species.

It compares perhaps more to larger confederal state or a supranational entity like the EU. Contrary to popular believe the HRE functioned quite well - all things considered - right up until 1806. Early on East Francia (the name HRE is actually a later and not often used one) was quite powerful and this forestalled the struggles of the West Francian kings with their powerful nobles. And no, this is actually different from the struggles the HRE later had (with its powerful constituent members) as by that time we’ve been through centuries of institutional evolution.

The HRE over the course of centuries evolved to a decentralisation of power, but not as simple as one may think. A focal point of difference with for example what became France is that the devolution of power went hand in hand with making *stakeholders* of its constituent members. Whereas later a Bourbon king eventually had to go up against his powerful nobility, the rulers of the HRE made these nobles part of the running of the Empire, which integrated all ruling segments in an interrelated web in - and this is the crux - whose interests it was to actually make things work.

All things considerd the HRE did it different, but different for them worked admirably well - with all its own issues.

And work it did, right up until 1806. No wars broke it before Napoleon, not even the Thirty Years War or Frederick II, the latter who rather used the Empire’s mechanics than oppose them.

My original comment was quote ""capitalist media.""  Social media isn't non-capitalist.  I never said anything originally about 'mainstream media.'  I just used data to show refute the false fact you stated that 'Nobody watches' which itself is not the case.  Then you tried to say the trend of cable media is down, which is still NOT MY POINT.  People swim in news that capitalists create for them.  Liberals take it and disseminate it, interpret it, analyze it, meme it, and whatever.  My original point is still there, you're arguing things that aren't even relevant to that point.

&gt; The reactionaries were able to push their agenda rather easily with much less money than the neo-liberals and much more success than the socialists.

Yes.  There's actually several commentaries about that process on youtube.  Reactionaries are themselves compatible with capitalism and so their 'agenda' properly disguised under things like 'immigration debate' worm their way through the capitalist media.  Further right, into actual organized neo-fascism movements there was a very real conscious effort to provoke anti-fascist action and the hide under liberal conceptions of free speech to get attention and protection from the liberals.  They literally hijacked the news by being unignorable.

&gt; Why don't socialists have our own version of Breitbart, Ben Shapiro, and Milo Yiannopoulos?

These people you mentioned all have heavy funding from third party capitalists, and because they're compatible with capitalism, get higher access to capitalist platforms.  Brietbart was created by the son of an affluent banker.  Ben Shapiro was friends with Brietbart for 14 years and is funded by capitalists to say pro-capitalist right wing things, Milo Yiannopoulos is also tightly linked with Brietbart.  So the answer to your question seems self-evident and part of my original point.  People with more money have more opportunity to buy attention and promote themselves.  Those three you mentioned are specifically upheld and promoted by capitalists for capitalist interests.  

In contrast, people like Jimmy Dore are the focus of intense alt right attacks gaming the system.  

&gt; the main problem for us is the memories of the Cold War and the USSR.

Which is fading hard yes.

&gt; The electoral process isn't effective?

Not at changing the dialectic relationship between the masters and the slave, no.

&gt; If we actually want to empower the proletariat and commit to a new route to socialism that at least has a chance to work, we have a fighting chance.

If by new way you mean revisionist bullshit, it will fail.  At best you will get social democracy out of the system, which is inherently anti-revolutionary.  I don't think we should give up.  Capitalism is self-contradictory.  If we aren't organized and educated, we're basically guaranteeing the dominance of fascism.  I'm all ears for a different way forward, as each country has to deal with its own material conditions, but restricting ourselves to the system arranged for us by our oppressors is basically you saying that we should just beg for freedom until we wear them down.

&gt; You yourself admitted that socialism didn't manage to escape the urban elitist bubble. 

No, I said that it seemed to be more prevalent in places where it was more easily shared.  I never said it was a bubble or elitist or that it hadn't or could escape.  You're bending phrases.

&gt; Socialists need to go directly to them and campaign.

I agree, except that I would say go directly and *organize.*  Campaign is top down, ""Vote for me and I'll do things for you.""  Organize is horizontal, ""We do things as a group for each other.""

&gt; with a handful of college hipsters and no proletarian support.

Ummm... I'm WELL out of college and I sweat for a living so get bent on that incredibly offensive caricature.  It's a conservative meme that just isn't true.  

&gt; Do you expect any country to fund a revolution against the US? No

The US has spent the entire last 80 years screwing over the planet.  Yes.  Emphatically.  If we were at that point where mass support for a change in economic system were a thing, I absolutely expect every country to either align with the Chinese/Russian power block or with the Europenean power block.  If we got to that point it would be a shitshow. 

&gt; They would rather sacrifice themselves to the bourgeoisie than to stand by the immigrants (especially undocumented) the GSD (LGBTQ+) community, the feminist movement, and so on.

A wise general wins the war before fighting it.  I absolutely expect them to do that.  Right now we have mass *liberal* mobilization to stand by undocumented immigrants unironically calling for radical changes like abolishing ICE.  This is why you organize.

&gt; The only way to pull a Ho Chi Minh or Mao Zedong would be to assimilate socialism to the native political culture.

Yes, that's why you have vanguard parties and organization.

&gt; I don't want to have white supremacy and Christian radicalism in my socialism, thank you.

Both of those are reactions to capitalism, not strictly cultural qualities that just come from no where.  Those are the fascists, and they aren't the majority.

&gt; but I see a few key reasons why the Cold War basically ended in the West's favor by 1948.

Congrats.  You totally failed to mention the underlying contradictions inherent in the Soviet form of governance leading to revisionism.

&gt; Stalin's ascension to power. That alone prohibited the masses in the west (or the east without the help of the NKVD for that matter) from supporting the Soviet Union.

Total BS.  That would have occurred regardless of who was in that seat.  Stalin was smeared by the fascists, and the capitalists took on it because they recognized communism as an inherent threat to capitalism.  

&gt; The majority of the Eastern Bloc countries would disagree with you.

No... actually they wouldn't, and no I won't provide evidence for it since the original statement was preposterous on its face and because you've provided nothing concrete to refute.  The US and Russia were not 'alike' in 1924 aside from being a top down undemocratic economy (which if that's what you meant then fine, but Russia's economy was centrally planned and still lacked needed industrialization).  If you're saying the Eastern block countries were unhappy, then I'm sure we could go round and round about what that means.  If you're saying that the eastern block countries were still similar to their old economies and not transformed yet at all... I mean my god, 1924 was what?  2 years after the civil war?

&gt; I'm not a social democrat. 

Then why are you even on about electoralism?

&gt; Millions still starved as a result of poor planning,

Bullshit.  Millions starved because they had famines, insufficient (but transitioning) industrialization, and if we're talking specifically about the holodomor, happened while foreign countries started refusing gold as payment for goods making it difficult to get the needed supplies.  There was also reactionary pushback to collectivization.

&gt; now without autonomy or empowerment, starved.

Yup, nothing to do with their former bosses burying livestock or burning crops, or the whole famine thing.  It had nothing to do with autonomy or empowerment.  What's your source on that?

&gt; Let's not have the proletariat bleed and die en masse from a white terror by the reactionaries.

Would you rather we just asked them nicely?

&gt; Don't commit to a revolution until you know that you at least have a majority or the economic might.

Well yea, you don't run out and hope for the best.  Again... there's a purpose behind a vanguard party (and it's not to BS the proletariat asking for concessions or pretend that electorism will suffice).

&gt; I open my fridge and see steel stacked neatly on the shelves. I walk into a shop and see chains limiting me at the aisles. I basically have my entire extended family either fall into poverty/debt/so on or distance themselves (a bit) because of the chains dragging people into different socioeconomic camps. Unless you went through the same problems, I would suggest that you shove it.

Welcome to the experience of the proletariat.  You aren't alone, but you seem to think that you can change the system while wearing those chains.  You can't.  So either sit down and accept the chains, or do something revolutionary.  If you aren't willing to do something revolutionary, then put the word freedom out of your vocabulary. 

&gt; Find a new alternative.

I'm fine with that, but there's not a chance in hell that you can vote away the power of the bourgeoisie.  None.  

&gt; Put your own self outside of 1937 and look at the 21st century. 

*eyeroll*  I am and have.  There is no peaceful solution to ending capitalism.  The capitalists will literally enslave us all in actual chains at gunpoint before giving up their power.  A century hasn't changed how power works.  I understand the basics of ML, and support ML's, but I never said I *was* only an ML.  Their revolutions have been the only thing to come close, at all, to both succeeding and maintaining power.  The handful of anarchist revolutions have died even quicker, and the democratically elected ones have all been couped pretty much immediately by the capitalists.  The problem with socialism isn't the ideology, it's the counter revolutionaries.

&gt; I will continue to act like an ""ass"" as long as the people before me foolishly venerate an archaic and collapse paradigm for socialism.

Then you will continue to be a counter revolutionary with no answers but self-defeat.  You come here and act like you know everything, but can't even understand how capitalist media works or its relationship to the superstructure.  You have nothing and you know nothing.

Blocked.

&gt; The Police were a new wave band which formed in 1977 in London, England. The band consisted of Sting (vocals, bass), Andy Summers (guitar) and Stewart Copeland (drums).  The band released five albums -- ""Outlandos d'Amour"" (1978), ""Reggatta de Blanc"" (1979), ""Zenyatta Mondatta"" (1980), ""Ghost in the Machine"" (1982) and ""Synchronicity"" (1983) -- before entering a hiatus in 1984 and ultimately disbanding in 1986

&gt; The band reunited in January 2007 for a reunion tour that lasted until August 2008. 

&gt; Biography 

&gt; The Police formed in early 1977 in London by Stewart Copeland (drums), Gordon Sumner, better known as Sting (bass and lead vocals), and Henry Padovani (guitar). Andy Summers later joined the group, and after a very short stint as a quartet, Padovani left the band. The Police became one of the most popular bands in the late 70s and throughout the 80s.

&gt; The Police are notable as one of the first mainstream white pop groups to adopt reggae as a predominant musical form and to score major international hits with reggae-styled material. (The first all-white reggae band with permanent members and frequent recording in Europe was Peps Blodsband, lead by Peps Persson from south Sweden who changed from blues to reggae 1974/75). Although reggae was already very popular in the United Kingdom (due to the large number of Caribbean immigrants) and a number of Western European countries, reggae was little known in the United States and rejected by most black artists in U.S, and prior to the emergence of the Police only a handful of reggae songs had enjoyed any significant chart success. The Police, UB40, The Clash and Bob Marley (Jamaican, partly living in England after being shot in Jamaica, are considered with a number of new wave, rock and ska bands as one of the leaders of the Second British Invasion of the U.S.

&gt; The Police were strongly influenced by reggae (especially reggae drumming and base lines), jazz and, in the beginning, punk rock – something that came to be shifted more and more towards pop during the 80s. Their lyrics also changed from challenging, but yet somewhat politically restrained punk- and new wave lyrics, to after 1982 in some songs emphasize environmental awareness and human oneness. The biggest hits, however, had romantic or sexual themes. The Police met together with other ""white"" British bands which played reggae, as UB40,  criticism from black English rastafarian reggae bands like Aswad (in a BBC documentary on TV) and Steel Pulse, for being accomplices in the music industry of ""Babylon"", stealing the Caribbean slave descendants' musical treasure. This criticism has later been withdrawn. Aswad has even made the covers of Police songs like ""Roxanne"".

&gt; Tension grew between the band members, because unlike most other bands, they did not share songwriting credits. They released their last album, Synchronicity, in 1983, selling over 8 million copies. Synchronicity is critically regarded as their best album, with hits such as Synchronicity II, King of Pain, and probably their best known song, Every Breath You Take. In 1984, after touring in support of Synchronicity, The Police went on hiatus while Sting pursued his acting and solo music careers. Two years later, The Police reformed and played a few concerts for Amnesty International.  Soon after the band went into the studio. Sting wanted to re-record their old songs but Andy and Stewart wanted to leave the originals alone and only two songs were re-recorded during these studio sessions. Although the group is considered to have disbanded in 1984, 1986 was the last time The Police engaged in any musical activity. 

&gt; In 1992 the band released ""Message in a Box"", their 4 CD box set, and performed at Sting's wedding to Trudie Styler.  A live CD was released in June 1995. On March 10, 2003 The Police were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  and performed Message in a Bottle, Roxanne and Every Breath You Take.

&gt; The Police reformed in 2007 and opened the Grammy award ceremony of that year with a performance of Roxanne. Towards the end of May the band began a world tour.  In  2008  the tour ended at Madison Square Garden, New York on August 7, and The Police disbanded for good.  Sting was quoted towards the end of the tour that he had achieved closure with the band and revealed that The Police would never tour or record again. 

&gt; Sting has said that the material on the album Ghost in the Machine were inspired by the writings of Arthur Koestler, and that the Police's final studio album Synchronicity was influenced by the writings of Carl Jung. Sting also peppers his songs with literary allusions: the song ""Don't Stand So Close to Me"" mentions Vladimir Nabokov's  novel Lolita; ""Tea in the Sahara"" alludes to the novel The Sheltering Sky by Paul Bowles; and ""Wrapped Around Your Finger"" refers both to the sea monsters Scylla and Charybdis, from Greek mythology, and to Mephistopheles, from the German legend of Faust .

THE SUN SAYS

GOBBY Irish PM Leo Varadkar has no idea how much damage he does with every Brexit utterance.

His latest salvo revealed a patronising, pompous arrogance as misplaced as it was sickening.
The mighty EU won’t change its rules for little Britain, Varadkar sneered.

“We’re 27 member states — the UK is one country,” he said. “We’re 500million people, the UK is 60million. That basic fact has to be understood.”

The Sun has some more basic facts:

Ireland’s population is 4.8million. The UK’s is 66.5million.

Ireland’s economy relies on us so heavily that a “no deal” is forecast to throw 2.5 per cent of its workforce on the dole. It is far more exposed than any other EU country, or the UK.

Our billions bailed out broke Ireland in 2010. Has Varadkar forgotten?

Is he happy to sour relations with millions of UK customers with long memories, who may take against Irish goods?

A wiser man would have acted as peacemaker, constructively helping both sides forge a historic deal in all our interests, including those of his country and its wonderful people.

Instead he chose another role . . . as the snivelling suck-up egging on the playground bullies.

“He seems to forget in the financial crisis it was Britain that borrowed money to help Ireland when the EU wasn’t prepared to help at all.

“He’s strutting around like he runs the EU and needs to start acting like a friend and neighbour.”

Another trick which often works well with the NHS is to find a specialist who works both privately and for the NHS. You then get a single private appointment with them and ask at the session if you can see them as an NHS patient. It's a way of circumventing a lot of the NHS waiting lists.

To japan it didnt really matter if a city was wiped out by several hundred bombers or a single B29 dropping a bomb. And even japans surrender was not mainly due to the atomic bombings. The soviet declaration of war and following invasion of manchuria had probably an equal or greater effect on the leadership of japan than the atomic bombings.

No, I am demonstrating that JC is a liar by highlighting some of the lies he has unarguably told. JC is a liar or so badly uninformed that he is utterly incompetent. These are demonstrable facts.

&gt; in the process alienating one of the core constituencies you need to win over

Nobody is ever going to win over people who think that JC is infallible. Those people will believe whatever he says. If I started pretending that JC was telling the truth about Brexit, I may as well support his hard Tory-style Brexit. That makes zero sense.

&gt; You can understand why it appears the FBPE thing is like 25% about Brexit and 75% about having a pop at JC.

Well yeah. If you take the discussions about Labour and about Corbyn and ignore most of the rest of it, I guess it might look like that. How many FBPE accounts do you follow? How many times this week have they had a pop at May, Johnson, Davis, Gove, Farrage, and others?

Here *on a forum specifically about Labour*, discussion is likely to *be about Labour*.

&gt; Protest those arseholes, the people who are actually doing this.

I do. A great deal.

The main difference is that if Labour shifted position to an honest one. Brexit would be in big trouble. Watching the sheer incompetence of Labour leadership when they have a chance not only to avoid the silliest act since 1945 but also to split the Tories perhaps permanently is very frustrating. No amount of pressure applied to Gove, Johnson, Davis, May, or Rees-MOgg is going to make them change direction. And the Remainers in the party are frozen out.

So of course they get criticised. But lobbying needs to be directed at Labour. Only Labour can hope to change the direction: and only by telling the truth about Brexit.

&gt; This will just be framed as, 'we think the British Public are stupid.' 

The British people are not stupid. They were taking in by ""lies on an industrial scale"", all of which have since been proven wrong. They were not served by a media which largely failed to question any of the open lies. If I had not been the type to do my own research, and instead just listened to the BBC news and the debates and the interviews, I might have been sold on Brexit myself. I have every sympathy for people who thought the NHS would get £350 million more a week (the lie which the head of Vote Leave said won it). Or that we would get better trade deals. Or that the EU make silly rules (the dozens of myths repeated down the years by the media, again). 

If the main a political party only ever tell lies to voters, who would expect the voters to be informed enough to make a decision, if the media never highlight the lies?

The British public need to be well informed, and to be told which of the Leave promises they voted for will actually come to pass (in this case, zero, as it happens).

&gt;  But the FBPE movement isn't interested in informing people, they are interested in calling Jeremy Corbyn a liar.

um.. do you know what FBPE stands for, why it formed, and what it aims to do?

Because that statement is flatly untrue and against the core reasons for it forming.

I mean, pointing out when Corbyn lies is *one* of the things I do, and *one* of the things that often happens on FBPE accounts. Mainly when he lies about Brexit. But it's not a main aim outside the paranoid delusions of the far-left groups currently sewing disinformation like the stuff you wrote above. You've been had, mate, I'm afraid.

&gt; yet you lose me when you start calling Jeremy Corbyn a liar,

How would you like me to phrase it?

""Jeremy Corbyn has repeatedly made statements on Brexit which were untrue, known to be untrue, demonstrated to be untrue again after he said them the first time, and yet he carries on making flatly untrue statements deliberately""?

Yes, that absolutely contributes to it. Islam is one of the defining features of the region. It has other reasons defining its borders too.

The Middle East is the name the British gave to the Asian part of the Mediterranean. In October 1902, a 20-article series entitled ""The Middle Eastern Question,"" was written by Sir Ignatius Valentine Chirol in The Times. During this series, Sir Igatius defines it as ""those regions of Asia which extend to the borders of India or command the approaches to India."" The region was the battle ground of great empires (Russia, Britain, France, Ottoman) and so needed a term. Asia, of course, includes Asia Minor, which is Turkey.

There is also (rightly or wrongly) a perception of Turks as ancient enemies of Europe/Christendom going back to the destruction of the Roman Empire. Therefore, Turks are seen as the “other” and not European. That is a very deep-seated cultural prejudice that is very hard to erase.

Ultimately, nebulous regions like this are based on perception, and most perceive Turkey to be a Middle Eastern country.",True,False,False,,0,1530527371,,1530527690,0,e1neblw,False,t3_8vgqdf,True,t1_e1ncd0a,/r/europe/comments/8vgqdf/istanbul_gay_pride_march_hit_with_tear_gas_as/e1neblw/,,1535575136,1,False,True,False,europe,t5_2qh4j,r/europe,public,

There will be an automated email, you need to reply to that, then a real human will look at the ticket.

&gt; Opened a thread on the forums after finding their US servers being routed through the netherlands and still not response.

They're **NOT** being routed through the netherlands.  What you might be seeing is the Akamai CDN scrubbing centre.


&gt;93.191.173.113 is a netherlands IP http://ipaddress.is/93.191.173.113

Note that geolocation results are often highly questionable.  For example, sometimes sites think I am in the USA (Florida) when I'm actually in the EU.  It's just that they're using the ownership information for the IP - the corporate IP I am on is owned from the USA whereas it is actually located elsewhere.

In this case, 93.191.173.113 is owned by Prolexic Technologies, which was bought by Akamai a few years ago.  They run the DDoS protection scrubbing centres.  All traffic to ESO is routed via the nearest scrubbing centre, there are 7 worldwide (2 in the USA, 1 in London, one in Frankfurt (Germany), one in Sydney, and I can't remember the location of the others).

&gt;By finding IP address of yourself or a person you wish to lookup, the geolocation lookup tool provide you with an estimate of where this IP address is located. American Registry of Internet Numbers, also known as ARIN, maintains the Whois Database containing contact and registration information for IP addresses. The companies requiring IP addresses obtain and register them with ARIN, and those IP addresses obtained are assigned to their users and customers. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) assign a dynamic IP address to a user when their customers connect to the Internet. **Since a company may be located throughout a large region (or a country), the accuracy of geolocation may vary depending on how they assign them to their users.**

So in my case, they get the wrong continent never mind the country.


-- Edit:

Current scrubbing centre locations: Ashburn, San Jose, Frankfurt, London, Hong Kong, Sydney, Tokyo

Then apparently they are about to open additional centres to make it 16 in total.

We flew into London and stayed at an Airbnb in Zone 2 as the prices in Zone 1 were over our budget. As we were in London for 6 days, we bought a travel card that allowed us unlimited travel in Zone 1 and 2 for a week. This was super convenient as we could go to all the places we wanted to visit really conveniently! I really recommend doing this! For your information, this is not the oyster card but a travel card by National Rail.

We then took the eurostar (we booked it as early as we could as prices increase after that!) to Paris and it was really comfortable, convenient, fast and easy! In Paris, I think we stayed somewhere in the 7th/15th arrondissement, in a cute little Airbnb. It was just beside a metro station, and there were several other metro stations nearby! In Paris, we didn't get any sort of travel card or so but instead bought tickets of 10 which we found was a more cost-saving option. In Paris, we walked a lot, walking even when we could have taken the metro. The main reason was budget but this also allowed us to take in fantastic sights everywhere! Paris is super pretty, love it!

Actually read what I wrote and read your own article!

&gt;Brussels has banned aviation regulators from holding backstop talks with Britain to keep **Europe’s planes** flying in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

It’s *their own planes* they would be grounding! As I said - with nothing in place, no European planes built with British parts would be able to fly - and that’s the Airbuses! That would be more of a nuclear option for themselves than for us!  How is that a sanction when you sanction yourself?! Just because you don’t understand that there needs to be a legal agreement between countries in order to fly planes between them, and an even closer agreement in order to operate flights solely within that area (i.e. not just to or from your own country) does not make it bureaucratic nonsense.  That’s nothing new!  It’s not a sanction.  It would affect their own planes as much if not more than ours and it’s literally how air traffic control works.

Just because the EU does not want a multitude of separate talks operating alongside the Brexit talks, with different sets of contradictory agreements undermining each other (a true bureaucratic nightmare) it does not mean they are refusing agreement.  It just needs to be agreed to in an organised and sensible way as we said we would at the start.

As I said - there are three options

a) stay in the European Common Aviation Area and be subject to European law and the ECJ.

b) form a bilateral agreement like Switzerland and accept some European law and effective ECJ jurisdiction, but lose some of the freedoms

c) Have open skies agreement like the US and EU which would not allow British operators to operate flights within the EU, only to and from the UK, and companies like Ryanair could no longer give us cheap flights within the UK.

Those are the choices.  Britain literally just has to pick one.  We can leave the EU, we can choose the level of cooperation we wish to maintain with them, or we can operate as a third country, but we have to make a choice!  We have to just not pick nothing - the problem is the deadlock within the Conservative Party, and the fact they’ve been lying to the electorate that we can have our cake and eat it in a way no other country does, but that’s not the EU’s fault!

Which would you choose?

Here is my personal breakdown of German politics right now:

**SPD** is dead, only the voters don't know it yet. The core of the SPD is still filled with career politicians who much prefer political infighting to any sort of coherent position or political conviction. I once had the opportunity to be at a social gathering where many low-level SPD people were hanging out and all they talked about was which party-internal grouping is currently ahead in the struggle for control of the party.

**CDU** is clinging to what they remember about conservatism and trying to attach themselves to public opinion. Also, will be plunged into chaos once Merkel resigns.

**AfD, LINKE, CSU** and **FDP** are trying to out-do each other in who can be more of a useful idiot to further Putin's agenda of splitting the EU.

The **Greens** are curiously still a somewhat reasonable party, although I can never vote for them because they will ban nuclear fusion research if they come into power, as they already tried in the early 00s.

All the smaller parties are either too small to matter or lunatics or both.

Not just Europeans in NATO and the EU, but Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, and Mexico. 

The US would be able to focus more on its noble efforts to defend the non-EU nations if the EU starting defending itself.

&gt; One of the great things was the American promise to protect it's allies.

And the EU would do the same for its own members.

&gt; More so, it also allowed for two-point combined American-European political approaches to international politics. You see that best in the game of Good Cop, Bad Cop (European diplomat explaining ""I can get you a good deal. But you'll need to agree these points. If you don't, maybe the USS Theodore Roosevelt sails with 500 miles of your capital""...

The only difference here would be the naming of the ship. ""I can get you a good deal. But you'll need to agree these points. If you don't, maybe the EUS Charlamagne sails with 500 miles of your capital""...

&gt;The US military being so large was also a major point in why other nations didn't build large militaries. Why build something if the best you could hope to build could never match what the US had at it's disposal. Better to not waste the money building that which would be easily outclassed and instead find a political solution long before conflict is possible. 

Which is why Europe has now found itself in a position where it is very vulnerable to US blackmail. It should never have allowed itself to become so reliant on an external power with dubious motives for something as fundamental as its own defence.

&gt; But the threat of force hanging out there didn't even often have to be made. Just the mere existence of the US Navy and it's ten aircraft carriers and nine Amphibious Assault ships that look suspiciously like slightly smaller aircraft carriers and each is larger than any Aircraft carrier used in WWII. This forces existence was and is very well known around the world. It's well known by design. 

And? Replacing 'US' with 'EU' there won't suddenly neuter the projection of power.

&gt;If the United States retreats into itself, the world is going get more dangerous for everyone. Very much including the United States.

\&gt;Implying the US hasn't helped make the world more dangerous itself

The war was fought to end Nazi Germany, who had brought a war of aggression onto Europe, and attempted to rule it under their dictatorial style of government. One of the main motivators for the allied citizenry, was the conviction that they were ridding the world of its greatest evil. That was only increased once evidence of Nazi crimes against “harmful peoples” was uncovered to the public. Knowing that you were helping prevent more victims of Nazism was a large propaganda factor for the allies. And there were many of those victims in the last weeks of the war. Which was my point. It silly to say that twelve weeks is nothing when talking about Nazi Germany. As for leadership, their motivation was to save the lives of their own soilders and end the war as quickly as possible, as it is in any war. Obviously that is within ethical bounds. But Dresden was completely within the rules of warfair at the time, so it was sound. 

 &gt;Still a shitty thing to do

Of course it was an awful, terrible, tragic thing. All things in war are. But the way people talk about it as a war crime, or as anything morally equivalent in any way, shape or form to the crimes of the axis powers, is just not sensible. Dresden, along with all other firebombing campaigns during the war, were an accepted part of warfair at the time. And that would still be the case even if the city was actually just trying to target civilian morale. But, again, the city was a legitimate strategic target as well. The city was one of the few mostly untouched industrial cities left in Germany, and was the main railroad transport for army groups Center and South now that they were pushed back (not to mention within Germany in general).

We all recognize firebombing is terrible. That is why the practise was made a war crime under today’s international regulations. If it is done today. But it’s just ridiculous to hold those in WW2 to the same standards. We didn’t even hold the Nazis themselves to the level. Again, no Nazi was ever prosecuted for bombing London. And that is because, even if the allies had never once firebombed any city anywhere, it still would have been unfounded to do so. Since we recognize that, at the time, it was an acceptable strategy of war.

It could allow the Treasury and the Bank of England to make changes to the EU’s Solvency 2 regulations, governing the amount of capital which must be maintained by insurers to guard against a crash. The measures were unduly harsh against British firms which have issued a lot of annuities – and Britain lost a battle in Brussels to address this.

I've heard this from more people who went to Rampage... So you're not the only one. 

**Does some others go to the festival solo?**  
There's a paper wristband for solo travelers so it's a common occurence. As you might've read, I went solo last year. If you have facebook you should join the Liquicity Festival 2018 facebook group and chat in there for a bit, more solo travelers do that. There's even a meetup scheduled on the friday or thursday before the festival iirc. 

**What are your advices (it might be ok to talk to people, i'm not really shy) ?**  
Advice: Enjoy yourself. Don't worry about the people. Just dance like you want to dance and be kind to people around you. You'll strike up a conversation in no time because people will be curious :) Enjoy yourself and you will appear open to others :) 

**What is the principal language talked into this festival ? Does a lot of persons talk english ?**

&gt;''The Left'' proposes policies that would alleviate the socioeconomic issues of the working class  
&gt;  
&gt;Lol when and where? The west stopped voting left because the left stopped caring about their voter base interests.

You're talking of neo-liberals, not the left wing in general, however I will absolutely agree with you that in Western Europe traditionally left wing parties have gone way too far to the right in their support for neo-liberal, lessez faire market policies, which I generally disagree with.

However, sorry, but at least in Eastern Europe ''leftist'' parties are not hated for their ignorance of the working class - since we actually support shit like Progressive taxation and Social welfare -  we've been demonised because the right wing sways people using shit like ''Liberasts'', ''Gayrope'' and other social conservative bullshit, which influences the working class just as much as it does ''white collar'' classes.

&gt;It’s as easy as that. But no you can’t accept that. “it can’t be because we the left did a poor job, we are the elite, we are perfect and god like creatures, saviours of the masses can’t be wrong. It must be because our adversaries cast a spell on all the people and their weak inferior minds got affected but ours didn’t”.

Sure, buddy, leftists are narcissistic demons and you're the snowflake victim.

&gt;But at the end of the day, if people don’t vote for you it’s because of your own shortcomings (being too caught up in identity politics, civil rights, and at the same time embracing globalism as a mantra and helping destroying workers rights revealing their actual disgust for the working class they view as inferior).  
&gt;  
&gt;until the Left doesn’t understand this the right wing populists will have a field day.

Yeah, sorry for fighting for civil rights, how dare we support minorities that are also a part of the working class.

The group's name is derived from the Ancient Greek φάσμα phasma, meaning an apparition or phantom, referring to the resemblance of many species to sticks or leaves. Their natural camouflage makes them difficult for predators to detect, but many species have a secondary line of defence in the form of startle displays, spines or toxic secretions. The genus Phobaeticus includes the world's longest insects.

Why does construction on the nuclear plant mean the plant is being improved?  Couldn't construction also be used to **re-purpose the facility?**

&gt;In addition to the Hamhung site, the Middlebury experts believe North Korea has two other nearby facilities dedicated to missile production. Mr. Schmerler said satellite imagery shows **a new entrance road** has been built at one facility and **demolition work** completed near another—**possible preludes to further expansion.**

Are you kidding me?  A new road and actual DEMOLITION WORK **possibly preludes to expansions?**  Are you all buying this?

&gt;An office building, **most likely to house engineers**, has also been completed, and massive construction work is taking place all over the site, according to 38North, a program of the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University.

So an office building is built.  It's gotta be for *Nuclear Engineers*.  Construction  couldn't be re-purposing the site, could it?  

&gt;Also this week, North Korea apparently **chose not to host** **its annual anti-U.S. mass rally** marking the end of the Korean War, which could be taken as a sign of rapprochement between Pyongyang and the West.

Notice how any news supporting North Korea's commitment to peace is placed at the bottom of the article, with little hope anyone will read it.

**What about North Korea cancelling their annual anti-US mass rally?**

**What about the North Korea removing Kim Jong Un's Grandfather and Father from the National Oath?**

**What about North Korea removing all Anti-US propaganda from the country?**

**What about North Korea and South Korea planning a joint railway to connect Korea with Europe?**

**What about North Korea actually demolishing one of their test sites with journalists present?**

Could it be more likely that the media is trying to push the narrative that Trump's accomplishment with North Korea is pointless?  Every accomplishment is portrayed as an alternate evil, because of bullshit articles written wish push a narrative people eat with a spoon.

You're seeing Hollywood actors threaten violence against Trump's children and wife.

You're seeing career Democratic politicians threaten violence against Trump administration officials.

You're seeing journalists getting fired or resigning for outright lying in order to ""get Trump.""

**Like the journalist who lied about the Maryland shooter dropping his MAGA hat?**

**Like Jennifer Lopez spreading false images of border separations?**

**Or the ""Children in Cages"" viral image used to attack Trump's immigration policies, which ended up being from 2014?**

Anyone see a pattern?

There are more American citizens that are members of the upper class then the lower class now.  China and Vietnam are obviously moving towards capitalism.  Cuba is moving towards capitalism. Venezuela is a diasterous shit show.  The Soviets are long done. The FARC is done.  The British Labor party isn't going to do frce coorporations into co-ops you are dreaming and those other parties you mention don't have much support. Marx is dead.

Hard core classic socialist are never going to outvote anything in America because we are too rich and invested in capitalism.  Socialists can't even outvote the Greens(also social democrats) in America or even run people for elections.  Hard core socialists are nearly existinct in America, don't agree with each other, don't work well with anyone, and are overwhelmingly white men.

That form of socialism is extremely ideological and the more ideological something is the more likely I am to resist it.  Intentions matter not.

There are lots of socialists who disagree with your Marxist and authortarian definition of socialism. Seizing capital from people is authoritarian and libertarian socialists aren't down with that.  I personally don't think any form of socialism is viable beside a vary authortarian illiberal form and the history of it all is obviously awful. 

I would sooner support Republicans, even Donald H. Trump, before I would support Marxists.  I am glad that progressive like Sanders and Cortez are upsetting the tankies.

Seezing capital(property) from people is a non-starter. It is a recipe for war, death, and destruction and I would be on the side of the capitalists.  I will resist all form of violation of property rights and seizing property.   The millionaires and billionaires wouldn't let their property be seized they would just leave America with all their capital and I would probably join them.  

That form of classic socialism is objectionable to 95% of Americans.  90% of Democrats are social dems and capitalists and would leave the Democratic Party if the Dems became truly socialist like you want.  European nations don't even support socialists like that.  You are dreaming if you think Democrats are ever going to be Marxists.

Democrats are just as democratic as other parties and can do whatever they want.   Individual Democrats can do whatever they want.  Bernie Sanders is not even a Democrat and he almost became the leader of the Democratic Party!  I think he would of been the leader of the Democrats if he would have actually decided to be a Democrat.  Maybe next time.

 I am very progressive, a social democrat and a capitalist.  I am a Sanders and FDR Democrat.  I would rather live in an America dominated by Republicans then one dominated by tankies and Marxists.

Personally, we and a small handful comparatively had been fighting the government for a decade. So many for so much longer. We saw then that Washington had only their interests in mind not the citizens of the USA. We saw the danger to America everyday. 

It took DJT not only wake up many, but he gave hope to the millions of Americans that the oppression they felt could be fought.

My parents, baby boomers born in the late 1940s.  Dad worked in a printing factory and Mum was a nurse (with about a 10 year break as a homemaker when we were little), they're both retired now.  They were Mods in the 1960s and part of the whole teenage revolution that happened in that era.  In their 70s now, they're into social media and into family history which they mostly research online.  They travel to Europe at least once a year, and visit us in the US every 1-2 years when they can afford it.  

My maternal Grandparents, born in 1920 and 1922. Grandad was a farmer who served in the home guard during World War II.  Sold the farm in the 1960s and became a delivery driver and gardener.  Went into semi retirement in his late 60s and did part time gardening for a wealthy individual, and spent the rest of his time in his own garden.  He worked from dawn 'til dusk until the last couple of years of his life.  Nanna married him at 19 and was a homemaker until the 1960s then worked part time in a canning factory.  Went back to being a homemaker in the 80s and stayed that way the rest of her life.  So far as technology goes, they owned a TV and radio.  We once bought them a VCR that they never used.  Grandad never left England, he was baffled by the idea of wanting to visit another country.  Nanna left the country once to visit her Great-Uncle's grave in Belgium.  

My paternal Grandparents were born in the same era but never saw old age.  Granny died in 1971 from an asthma attack and Grandad died in 1984 from lung cancer about a year after retirement.  I think Grandad would have been into the early home computer revolution had he lived long enough, I'm told my interest in technology stems from him as he was a signalman in World War II (serving in Burma) and was always tinkering with electronics.

My Great-Grandparents were born in the 19th century.  I only knew my maternal Great-Grandmother.  The men always wore three piece suits, even when working.  My maternal Great-Grandfather in pictures looks like an Edwardian gentleman with a suit, hat and gold watch on a chain.  The women always wore dresses and were homemakers.  It was unthinkable they would work and I remember my Great-Grandma having strong opinions about women who did, and even stronger ones about women who wore trousers.  She lived to see her 94th birthday.  My maternal Great-Grandfather worked from age 7 (started as a bird scarer) and left school at 14 to work the fields.  He worked until he was 85, retired, and promptly had a stroke two weeks later.  Not working is what killed him according to family lore.

I know almost nothing about my paternal Great-Grandparents other than their names.  They died when my Dad was very young.

that thing is on Spanish (/ˈspænɪʃ/ (About this sound listen); About this sound español (help·info)) or Castilian[4] (/kæˈstɪliən/ (About this sound listen), About this sound castellano (help·info)), is a Western Romance language that originated in the Castile region of Spain and today has hundreds of millions of native speakers in Latin America and Spain. It is usually considered the world's second-most spoken native language, after Mandarin Chinese.[5][6][7][8][9]

Spanish is a part of the Ibero-Romance group of languages, which evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin in Iberia after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century. The oldest Latin texts with traces of Spanish come from mid-northern Iberia in the 9th century,[10] and the first systematic written use of the language happened in Toledo, then capital of the Kingdom of Castile, in the 13th century. Beginning in the early 16th century, Spanish was taken to the viceroyalties of the Spanish Empire, most notably to the Americas, as well as territories in Africa, Oceania and the Philippines.[11]

Around 75% of modern Spanish vocabulary is derived from Latin. Ancient Greek has also contributed substantially to Spanish vocabulary, especially through Latin, where it had a great impact.[12][13]

Spanish vocabulary has been in contact with Arabic from an early date, having developed during the Al-Andalus era in the Iberian Peninsula.[14][15][16][17] With around 8% of its vocabulary being Arabic in origin, this language is the second most important influence after Latin.[14][18][19] It has also been influenced by Basque, Iberian, Celtiberian, Visigothic, and by neighboring Ibero-Romance languages.[20][14] Additionally, it has absorbed vocabulary from other languages, particularly the Romance languages French, Italian, Occitan, Catalan and Sardinian, as well as from Nahuatl, Quechua, and other indigenous languages of the Americas.

Spanish is one of the six official languages of the United Nations. It is also used as an official language by the European Union, the Organization of American States, the Union of South American Nations, the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, the African Union and by many other international organizations.[21]

1. The EU had no obligation to make it easier for us and would have disadvantaged themselves by doing so.

Congratulations you've compared a hat to a burqa.

For anyone confused why I would find this comparison absurd, here are photos of a person in a hat, and a person in a burqa. Surely one looks more dehumanizing than another, yeah? The reader can decide which.

I even gave an example of the most concealing hat I could find.





&gt; That is your fashion analysis of the niqab. People who wear it have other views. Who appointed you editor of Vogue? 

That's odd, can you reference progressive cultures where women are largely equal with men and the niqab or burqa has spontaneously gained favour among women? The niqab and burqa have been in the public consciousness for quite some time now, and we have societies encompassing billions of people; surely if a niqab or burqa was desirable it would have come about as a garment worn by a sizable amount of people unaffiliated with Islam by now, yeah?

&gt;Forbidding women from wearing the niqab is exactly like ""forbidding them from voting or something but whatever."" Both are denials of a hugely important right at the centre of our society. You're saying that because some women are forced to wear the niqab, we ban all of them from wearing it. Some women are forced to vote, so why not take away the franchise? Makes sense, right? 

You can continue to frame banning the niqab or burqa as ""forbidding women to vote"" all you want, it will never make sense.

&gt;
You want to impose a statutory dress code on minority women that will have the effect of excluding them from civil society. But I'm the one that is in favour of oppression. Got it. 

I have actually stated that I'm unsure of how far we should go in restricting people from certain activities to fight oppression. You might have missed that, but if you re-read my last post it is there! So you're accusing me of things I haven't said :/

Furthermore, I assume you're well read in sociology, or at least sufficiently enough that you know sociological concepts and understand a holistic sense of how one goes through life and/or exercises agency. 

There is surely some dissonance then, in the notion that a child who grows up in a culture that devalues her and impresses restrictions on her, ""willingly"" wears the burqa or niqab. Girls in these families often recant how painstakingly brutal it is for them to give up their cultural norms given that they have to essentially disown their families.

Anyways, my post wasn't meant to support the banning the niqab or burqa, but more to hold you to an honest argument since there was virtually no honesty in your OP from my perspective.

Honesty in that you're actually arguing that people ought to be free to oppress others and themselves if their philosophical doctrine commands it. You're not crusading for women's rights, as you like to frame it.

I also say that because, after looking at every other instance of a Force-bond's formation in old and new canon, Force-bonds are typically formed:

- Over time, gradually, between a Master and Apprentice, through ""truly understanding the other"" (i.e. Yoda and Dooku)
- Through Jedi Battle meditation, but the Force-user had to be *extremely* powerful to do this (i.e. Bastila Shan)
- Through sharing a womb with a Force-sensitive twin, and/or growing up with a very close relationship (i.e. Luke and Leia, Jacen and Jaina from the EU)
- Through experiencing a moment of death, near-death (i.e. ""near-death experience""), and/or saving someone's life, such as to share life-force to keep them alive (i.e. Bastila Shan and Revan)
- Re-establishing someone back in the Force after them having ""cut themselves off from it"" (i.e. Kreia and Meetra Surik)
- Natural ability to form Force-bonds with others (i.e. Meetra Surik, and, I suspect, Leia Organa)

All of these are pretty major events, especially in comparison to the interrogation scene. However...

If it *is* true that the bond was formed in TFA (or, at least, the start of it), then I suspect, based on existing lore, that Kylo / Ben is the main factor in its formation. This is because his mother, Leia, shared what can only be described as ""a natural Force-bond"" with her twin, Luke, and Kylo / Ben inherited his Force abilities from Leia.

Likewise, Kylo / Ben also had the following factors going for him:

- wanting to establish a Master-Apprentice relationship between him and Rey
- ""truly understanding"", and feeling ""compassion"", for Rey
- a natural ability (unconciously, or so it seems) to form Force-bonds with others, like Leia
- a case where his powers have ""gotten stronger, hungrier...seeking to quickly draw other Force-sensitives to his company""",True,False,False,,0,1530545991,,1530546410,0,e1nt8kz,False,t3_8vfa9u,True,t1_e1n9dd0,/r/StarWarsCantina/comments/8vfa9u/reys_practice_on_ahchto_kylo_and_lukes_battle_on/e1nt8kz/,,1535582107,3,False,True,False,StarWarsCantina,t5_ge6kz,r/StarWarsCantina,public,

The brexit fiasco will be blamed by the tories on the EU and Remainers. But when people point out factory closures, they will simply say ""that was also Labour policy and here are 3 videos of Corbyn saying so.""

I don't know it is that, nor does anyone else. It would be a first, which means it needs to be tested. Even EU lawyers have different interpretation on it, they have far more knowledge than us so if they are confused, it isn't really a surprise if we are. The political will is there from the EU definitely.

To an extent, certainly it is. Or rather the behaviour of the government.

But the EU wants us to stay, it would be damaging to itself and not just economically, it wouldn't make sense to remove all ability to stay unless we were worth nothing to them, which we aren't.

&gt; But with both no widespread change in public opinion, both main parties arguing for Leave, and a domestic election where no ""this is nuts we should stay"" party came from nowhere to sweep the board then...

Which won't happen, simply because as you said:

&gt; with both no widespread change in public opinion

What public opinion from both sides is saying, is that the referendum must be respected. Which I don't personally agree with, but then I can see why either or any party would say it must be respected, because essentially the one that doesn't is going to get politically obliterated.

Überläufer: Jehovas Film ist gefährlich für die Kinder
Metro (Schweden), Montag, 2. Juli 2018 - Titelseite (via Google Translate)

Anti-LGBT. Zeugen Jehovas hatten an diesem Wochenende eine große Versammlung in der Hauptstadt mit vielen Kindern im Publikum. Dann zeigte die religiöse Gesellschaft einen Film von hbtq-kritischen Botschaften - den der Staat nicht überprüfen musste.

Zeugen Jehovas zeigen Filme, die LGBQ von Kindern missachten - Fehlende Erlaubnis
Metro (Schweden), Montag, 2. Juli 2018 - Seite 4 (via Google Translate)

Religion. Bei der Jahresversammlung der Zeugen Jehovas werden Filme mit Anti-HBTQ-Nachrichten gezeigt. Obwohl der Gemeinschaft die erforderlichen Genehmigungen fehlen, werden die Filme Tausenden von Zeugen Jehovas mit Hunderten von Kindern im Publikum gezeigt.

""Sie wissen nicht, wie gefährlich das für Kinder ist"", sagt Sabina Sjöberg

BILD: Mehrere großformatige Displays zeigen die Botschaft der Zeugen Jehovas während des jährlichen Treffens - aber keine Erlaubnis für den Film, der die Sicht der Gesellschaft auf LGBQ vermittelt.

Die jährliche Versammlung der Zeugen Jehovas beginnt mit der Konferenz, in der das Publikum aufgefordert wird, nichts von diesem Tag für andere als private Zwecke aufzunehmen.

Etwa 8.000 Menschen haben sich auf der Stockholmer Messe in Älvsjö, etwas außerhalb von Stockholm, versammelt. Die Veranstaltung ist öffentlich zugänglich.

Es ist das vierte Jahr, in dem das jährliche Treffen der Zeugen Jehovas auf der Stockholmer Messe stattfindet, die zur Stadt Stockholm gehört. In diesem Jahr lautet die Kernbotschaft Mut zu zeigen.

Mit gut produzierten Filmen aus dem Regierungskreis der Gemeinschaft in den Vereinigten Staaten können wir unter anderem sehen, wie eine Frau eine Manifestation von Menschen mit HIV-Status distanziert. Ein anderer Film zeigt, wie ein kleiner Junge mit der Angst vor ""harmagedon"" konfrontiert wird, die die Zeugen Jehovas als den letzten Kampf zwischen Gott und denen betrachten, die sich weigerten, sich der Herrschaft Gottes zu unterwerfen.

Die Filme und Geschichten werden auf vier großen Bildschirmen für ein Publikum mit Hunderten von Kindern und Jugendlichen gezeigt.

""Eltern sagen nicht, dass es nur ein Film ohne etwas ist, was tatsächlich passieren wird"", sagte Sabina Sjöberg, die vor gut 20 Jahren Jehovas Zeugen verlassen hat.

Heute engagiert sie sich in der Organisation Kinderstimme in einer geschlossenen Sekte, die Zeugenaussagen von Menschen sammelt, die Jehovas Zeugen verlassen haben. Sie haben sowohl den Landesmedienrat als auch die Polizei konsultiert, um das Videomaterial, das während des Treffens gespielt wird, zu warnen. Laut Sabina Sjöberg hat die Polizei jedoch nicht geantwortet.

- Sie wissen nicht, wie gefährlich das für Kinder ist. Vor zwei Jahren wurden Filme gezeigt, bei denen sich Familien und Kinder in einem Keller versteckten. In der letzten Szene stürmen Soldaten mit automatischen Waffen, sagt sie.

- Als Kind einen Actionfilm zuhause zu sehen, können die Eltern trösten. Wenn Sie Filme von Disney nehmen, können Eltern die Kinder trösten und sagen, dass es nicht wahr ist, aber hier ist kein Komfort und die Kinder bekommen schreckliche Albträume.

Laut dem National Media Council, dessen Aufgabe darin besteht, Altersgrenzen für Filme festzulegen, die Kindern unter 15 Jahren gezeigt werden sollen, erfüllt die Veranstaltung die Kriterien für eine allgemeine Versammlung und die Filme müssen gesetzlich eine Altersgrenze haben festgelegt von der Behörde.

Sie haben gegenüber der Polizei darauf hingewiesen, dass die Organisatoren der Versammlung keine Erlaubnis zur Ausstellung der Filme suchten. Strafmaßstab für die Verletzung des Gesetzes umfasst Gefängnis.

Wenn Metro mit der Presseabteilung der Stockholmer Börse redet, sagen sie, dass sie nichts über die Erlaubnis wissen und verweisen Fragen über die Filme an die Rechtsabteilung der Gemeinde.

""Wir hoffen, dass nichts für jemanden negativ erlebt wird. Das ist natürlich nicht das Ziel von etwas, was wir zeigen, aber unsere Rechtsabteilung beantwortet solche Fragen"", sagte Niklas Sondell von der Presseabteilung.

Gestern konnte die Stockholmer Polizei nicht antworten, ob sie an der Veranstaltung war, um zu überprüfen, ob ein Verstoß begangen wurde.

""Wir hoffen, dass nichts für irgendjemanden negativ erlebt wird."" Niklas Sonell bei der Presseabteilung der Zeugen Jehovas

In Schweden gibt es etwa 22.000 aktive Mitglieder in 310 Parlamenten.

Ist die einzige religiöse Gemeinschaft, die staatliche Subventionen verweigert wurde. Im Jahr 2017 sagte die Regierung nein mit der Motivation, dass die Gesellschaft ihre Mitglieder auffordert, keine Bluttransfusionen für Minderjährige zu erhalten.

Ich werde mit Pädophilen und Mördern verglichen - zur Freude der Sekte
Metro (Schweden), Montag, 2. Juli 2018 - Seite 24 (via Google Translate)

BILD: Als sich Zeugen Jehovas zu einer offenen Versammlung in der Friends Arena versammelten 2015 haben 50.000 Menschen teilgenommen. 

""Ich erinnere mich an das Gefühl von Glück und Zusammengehörigkeit"", schreibt Erik Engelv, der bereits auf ähnlichen Messen Erfahrungen gesammelt hat, bevor er auf Jehovas Zeugen gehofft hat. Jetzt, wo ich vor den Zeugen Jehovas stehe, sehe ich eine Propagandamaschine, die behauptet, die Hbt-Bewegung sei Gottes Gegner. Kann ich wirklich nur zusehen, wenn meine Eltern dies an dem Ort applaudieren, an dem ich vor ein paar Monaten als verheirateter Schwuler gearbeitet habe? schreibt Erik Engelv: ""Diejenigen, die heute die führende Gesellschaft sind, wissen, dass LBTQ-Fragen sensibel sind und zeigen, dass wir gegen sie sind."" Nach der Geburt wurde ich mit dem gefüttert, was Jehovas Zeugen für das ursprüngliche Christentum in der Bibel halten. Sie werden sicherlich erkennen, dass Sie kein Blut erhalten, Geburtstage feiern oder Sex vor der Ehe haben. Ein wenig wissbegierig, wenn man sich die Theologie genauer anschaut, findet man weitere Ideen, dass alle anderen Religionen falsch sind, dass diejenigen, die die Versammlung verlassen, komplett rausgeworfen werden und dass schwule Männer mit Vergewaltigern, Pädophilen und Killer gleichgesetzt werden. Ich war absolut überzeugt Das war die Wahrheit. Ich erinnere mich an das Gefühl von Glück und Zusammengehörigkeit, als du dich zu Tausenden für die jährliche Sommerversammlung versammelst und eine gründliche Ausbildung in den Lehren der Bibel erhieltst und davon, dass ich wie ein wahrer Christ lebe. 

Wenn ich jetzt als Erwachsener aus bin die Sekte, ich sehe etwas ganz anderes. Ich sehe eine Propagandamaschine, die behaupten will, die gesamte HGBQ-Bewegung sei Gottes Gegner. Ich sehe, wie man Filme mit Nachrichten produziert und zeigt, die Null-Toleranz für verheiratete Ehen fordern. Und ich werde daran erinnert, dass Jesus, wenn er genug von dem Elend auf Erden empfangen hat, auf seinem weißen Pferd herunterkommt, um uns alle aufzuräumen, die glauben, dass man genau das lieben muss, wen man will. Und es passiert völlig offen. Bei mir zu Hause. Wir dürfen niemals vergessen, dass jeder zu seinem eigenen Glauben berechtigt ist und Gott für die Redefreiheit dankt! Aber wir müssen auch scharf hinterfragen und visualisieren, was an diesem Wochenende tatsächlich auf der Stockholmer Messe gesagt wurde, wo die Stadt Stockholm ein Partner ist. Ehrlich gesagt, habe ich Schwierigkeiten zu glauben, dass alle Menschen, die sich Jehovas Zeugen nennen, darauf wetten werden. 

Aber so funktionieren Sektenmechanismen in der Praxis. Die Führer der heutigen Gesellschaft wissen, dass hbtq-Fragen sensibel und ein ausgezeichnetes Thema sind, um einen ""wir gegen sie"" -Geist zu schaffen. Und je mehr wir, die von außen schauen, reagieren und handeln, desto mehr sehen sie den Grund aufzuhören. Sollen wir ruhig sein? Kann ich wirklich nur zusehen, wenn meine Eltern am selben Ort sitzen und applaudieren, an dem ich vor ein paar Monaten wie ein verheirateter Schwuler gearbeitet habe? Ist es in Ordnung, dass die Stadt Stockholm auf der einen Seite Einkommen aus einer Gesellschaft mit sozial destruktiven Botschaften erhält und auf der anderen Seite eine der weltweit freundlichsten Städte ist? Sollten wir eine Plattform für diese Botschaft bieten, um die Ecke von der Treppe, wo ich mit dem jungen Mann, der so weiche Lippen und so schönes lockiges Haar hatte, im Sommerregen aufgehängt habe? Ironischerweise denke ich oft an einen Vers im Alten Testament in der religiösen Rhetorik verwendet. ""Fürchte dich nicht, denn es gibt mehr mit uns als mit ihnen."" Weißt du was ich denke? Ich denke, wir sind weit mehr, die für den gleichen Wert und die gleichen Rechte aller Menschen eintreten. Ich bin absolut sicher, dass wir viele, viele mehr sein werden, die alle Pride-Paraden im ganzen Land feiern, als die religiöse Gruppe, die auf der Stockholmer Messe versammelt ist. Denn Liebe überwindet alles. Es sagt so. Auch in ihrer Bibel!

i don't believe that *inherently* calling an item 'inherently tasteless' is problematic. there's plenty of stuff out there that i think we could all agree is in terrible taste, like t-shirts with offensive/racist slogans on them or whatever. that said, i find a good bit of the arguments that bring up some universal idea of taste as having roots in something classist or racist. like what's mentioned in the original post - people who point out that the items splashed in logos and visible branding are 'tacky' while they also tend to be on the cheaper end of the spectrum - and thus the much more expensive, unbranded items are the 'tasteful' ones. i think there is an implication there that if you're poor you can only get the tacky stuff, whereas if you are wealthy and able to afford more you can 'buy yourself some nice taste'.

'taste' in general is a pretty elite privilege. it is only when you are able to afford a higher echelon of choice that you can really develop taste. there's nothing wrong with this (i too enjoy the 'finer taste of things' that i can afford to choose) but what is potentially problematic is judging others who cannot afford to develop that taste against your developed (or more realistically, *afforded*) taste. greater societal norms of taste across all aesthetics and arts have been by and large dictated by the cultural elite (european or american white male) and so i see looking down on something as being 'inherently tasteless' being a somewhat similar dynamic as calling people from different ethnic groups 'uncivilized'. so they don't fit into your picture of society - that doesn't mean it's uniformly bad. there are power dynamics at play, and while no case will ever be black and white, i do believe it's worth thinking about.

------------------------------

&gt;""**Hungary had been actively aiding Ukraine.** Hungary was among the first EU member states to ratify the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement. Hungary’s policy toward Ukraine has largely been in line with that of its Western allies, including voting to support the sanctions and resolutions against Russia. **Hungary also supported Ukraine’s visa-free travel to the EU**—partially for selfish purposes, of course, given that more than 150,000 ethnic Hungarians live in Ukraine.""

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;""Early on, however, there were some controversial moves. In May 2014, right after the annexation of Crimea, Orbán demanded autonomy for Hungarians in Transcarpathia (...)""

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;""Despite these factors, until fall 2017 Hungary was with the EU mainstream in its relations with Ukraine. But that before the **Verkhovna Rada’s vote on the legislative package on education, which curbs the rights of ethnic minorities to education in their mother tongue.** The law states that Ukrainian will be the main language in schools, placing restrictions on teaching in minority languages beyond the primary school level. ""

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;""The international community, and especially Poland and Bulgaria, should try to convince the Hungarian government to tone down its criticism; policymakers should also conduct diplomacy behind the scenes about their opposition to the education law. The United Kingdom and the United States should communicate clearly with Hungary as well, increasing pressure on the country to be more diplomatic toward Ukraine and more loyal to its Western alliances in this conflict.

No it's not obvious - hence why the government hasn't come out and said that's what it wants!   Find evidence of that!  The government can't agree anything as I've told you. \*That's the problem - not the EU!\*

\&gt;But the EU is threatening to refuse any kind of recognition at all.

Completely wrong.  Total fabrication. You haven't shown this at all.

\&gt;I've shown you the evidence for this, but you've simply invented a menu of reasonable options you assume the EU is suggesting.

Of course the EU isn't refusing any agreement!  What you're referencing, as I already explained, and is already perfectly obvious to anyone reading those articles, is the EU rejecting attempts to form piecemeal negotiations running alongside the Brexit negotiations, contingent on no deal, which contradict and undermine the official Brexit negotiations which we agreed to, which we are entitled too under Article 50, and which are the official means by which we negotiate our exit of the EU.  We can choose either closer integration, or greater separation, but the government hasn't committed to either because it's promised, and Brexit promised, what it could never deliver.  Brexiteers literally said we would be able to have our cake and eat it, and now the red lines run in both direction - we refuse jurisdiction of the ECJ, and we refuse to be on the outside looking in with tariffs and a hard Irish border.  If the government had wanted the hard Brexit you obviously want, it could have had it and been done by now.  If it wanted common market membership or customs union membership it could rejoin EFTA in a heartbeat.    You're confusing a ""no deal"" Brexit with a hard Brexit but they aren't the same thing at all and the chaos over flights is a very good reason not to run out the clock on Article 50 negotiations as a substitute for actually coming forward and saying what kind of Brexit we want, hard or soft.

* **nose**: buttery, cabernet, salt, barbecued oranges, red grapes

* **nose with water**: more grape for me, grappa, surprisingly little smoke, sweet cabernet, chocolate

* **taste**: cabernet, salt, creamy texture, pepper, heather, medium to full mouthfeel

* **taste with water**: sweet wheat, cabernet, pepper, orange jam, oak, still very creamy

* **finish**: red fruit, berries, salt, smoke, ashes, acidic, sweet grapes, medium to long finish

* **finish with water**: a little more dry, red berry jam, smoke comes in towards the end, slightly acidic

* **score**: 91/100

****

**conclusion**: this one has a very nice astringency coupled with the wine notes that do make it really stand out, even among all the smoke and ash. the creamy texture was unexpected for me, something i haven't gotten in the 7.x line. the peat has a nice barbecue flavor, with strong  orange notes for me, but the grappa/cabernet were my favorite flavors in here. it's big, but it didn't feel young, just strong as most of the Octomores have been for me, and i believe less smoke. water really didn't make much of a difference for me, it just helped smell and taste a little more, but the strength of character held strong.


if i had to choose, i'd give this the edge over the 7.2, but i'd really need to do a SbS to be certain. i think the age difference between the two made this one less aggressive for me and the wine flavors more pronounced, the smoke level was a little more in tune with my palate. i haven't done an official review of it, however i did do one of the 7.1, which is not the same of course, but if you're interested:

False,sniper989,1369861250.0,,Camera,[],,,dark,text,t2_bun42,"""This striking &amp; highly decorative poster map of French Indochina was designed by the renowned French affichiste and illustrator, Lucien Boucher [1889-1971]. Printed by the firm of Perceval, Paris, it was originally commissioned by the Association Nationale de L'Indochine Francaise. The original publication date of the poster is hard to determine precisely. Many authorities have dated it to circa 1938-40, but available evidence suggests this is highly unlikely. The Association Nationale de L'Indochine Francaise appears to have been founded under the auspices of the Free French administration in Algiers in August 1943. Its stated objectives were to try and maintain an enduring &amp; unbreakable bond between France and her South East Asian territories throughout the duration of war and during its inevitably problematic aftermath. Most of France's South East Asia colonial administrations had remained nominally loyal to the pro-Nazi Vichy regime during the early years of the war, enduring an often uneasy relationship with local Japanese occupation forces who had moved into French Indochina in December 1941. With D-Day in June 1944 and the Liberation of Paris two months later, French Indochina's ongoing relationship with its now newly liberated mother country &amp; its new former Free French leader, De Gaulle, was further challenged. The sitation however was transformed in early 1945 when South East Asia witnessed the sudden &amp; calamitous disintegration of France's long-established colonial presence in the region. The Japanese, facing imminent defeat in Burma &amp; the Philippines and increasingly fearful of an American landing in French Indochina, unleashed Meigo Sakusen (Operation Bright Moon), a coup d'etat in March 1945, which initiated unprovoked attacks by Japanese troops across French Indochina &amp; the imprisonment of all French administrative officials and military personnel. According to the French diplomat Jean Sainteny, the Japanese actions ""wrecked a colonial enterprise that had been in existence for 80 years"".

It seems highly that likely Boucher's poster was an emotive propaganda vehicle published in Paris at this highly sensitive &amp; politically uncertain juncture to underline the enduring cultural bonds &amp; historical links between the newly liberated French homeland in Europe and her longstanding South East Asian territorial outposts, now in the harsh grip of Japanese occupation or under the equally hostile rule of newly installed Japanese puppets &amp; proxies in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. Boucher's vision of French Indochina is a richly exotic &amp; vibrantly colourful portrait of peaceful, benificent colonialism. Presented as a geographically integrated entity, without any regional borders or boundaries between its constituent territories, it is a region seemingly entirely untouched by World War Two. The only visible manifestation of conflict is the poweful battleship whose somewhat menacing &amp; shadowy presence disturbs the otherwise peaceful waters of the South China Sea. Boucher focuses on the richness of indigenous flora and fauna, with attractive vignettes of elephants, snakes, monkeys, deer, tigers &amp; leopards. The region's important natural resources are also highlighted, with beautifully presented scenes of rice planting, farming, logging and mining. Nor does Boucher's Indochinese vision ignore the wealth &amp; richness of the region's own indigenous history and culture, as equally striking illustrations reference the unique archaelogical sites &amp; temple ruins of Cambodia's Angkor Wat &amp; Kampong Cham and Vietnam's ancient Imperial City of Hué (later the scene of terrible fighting during the Vietnam War's 1968 Tet Offensive). Offshore, numerous oriental junks and fishing vessels ply their trade amid shoals of fish, turtle and a giant sea monster. A stunningly designed large compass spur upper right is counterbalanced by an equally striking title cartouche lower left, whose orientaliste motifs and decoration further emphasize the region's exotic indigenous culture &amp; much-prized commercial riches.""

This global aid that’s needed to speed up the process of lowering birth rates will not be sufficient when the poorer regions populations will be too large for the funds to do anything substantial. 
Along with climate change, this intense growth could cause great famines and droughts in the region and create a horrible reality for its inhabitants. 

I don’t think it’s exactly comparable to previous nations in Eurasia, as they were large fertile areas with lots of natural resources (wood, meat, fruit, water), that had relatively little people in it, the populations grew very slowly until industrialisation and then exponentially grew and then levelled out eventually. 

But before this Europe and Asias populations were constantly rising and falling dew to war and invasions, particularly China who at one point had 110 million pre Mongol invasion but had dropped to 60 million after, similarly in Europe with plagues, wars etc. right up until WW2 there was huge losses of life. 
 
Similar cases are found all across Eurasia, events that kept populations in check. 
Another factor is that China and India’s populations have always been large, sub Saharan Africa’s hasn’t, its population growth has been rapid and outpaced development immensely.

So either the global community comes to together to aid proper irrigation and efficient agriculture in the region to provide for its people, stop the growth of the Sahel and desertification, or the governments of the region install proper growth control measures.

Wouldn't the best way to do that be to send MEPs there who will actually take that case to the EU? Because it seems we elected quite a few incompetent people to the EU parliament who treated it like a joke. The public media never let us care about the functions of the EU it left it to be taken apart by the tabloids with obvious agendas. We could have been protesting these things if they were truly unfair and the UK could use it's democratic power to challenge it. If there's something we think is unfair we go round the other countries and ask them their thoughts maybe it is only beneficial to Germany or France well fuck that let's get a more equal share going. We're so unfamiliar with the work and function of the EU we've begun to fear it like it's a god we can disappoint which is ridiculous but it's self imposed ignorance.

&gt;This is why i think brexit was a good idea and i hope Scotland doesn’t go independent just to join the EU and sacrifice that independence.

Why when every argument you've put forward is equally true of Scottish independence as it is Brexit?

&gt;Like it or not English and Scottish blood fought and died for the existence of the UK only for that to be threatened by millennials.

That's not a good enough reason. We can be sentimental about it but that will not change reality. By your own logic that should mean as a Scottish person I should keep up the old century long hatred of the English? I don't that wasn't me and it doesn't get to dictate how we progress from here none of it does and holding on to petty animosity just makes you a grumpy bastard. Is there a specific age group that are threatening our history? Seems to me like they're the first ones who want to read about the whole truth not the Empire minded glossy version. They don't want to repeat the mistakes of the past and this mindset isn't just confined to millenials either that would be a naive way to view the world.

&gt;3.vote UKIP was a joke just to get a reaction outta some ppl.

Why? Or are you simply pretending it was a joke? Stand by your convictions, if you're going to go against all logic and facts you might as well proclaim it for all to hear. If it was a joke it wasny funny.

False,Vahlir,1408499324.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_hyj9w,"I guess I'm kind of jaded against post like this because maybe I hit that reflection a LONG LONG time ago, meaning, when I was in the Army or when I was living in Europe for a year out of a backpack. You don't NEED much but unless absolute minimalism is a goal why deprive yourself of items. I mean there Buddhist are SEVERE minimalist and adhere to non-attachment of items but they still have large temples filled with all kinds of things and tools, etc (refering to the monastics). The items are community owned not personally but they still recognize the need for items. Then there are the monks with a single bowl. They have to go around the village asking for food donations because they cannot provide their own. 

I guess I ask ""what's the point?"" People often say ""everything I own fits in my car"" or ""I could pack up and move to another country in 30 minutes."" That's not a feature of that kind of lifestyle, that's the actual goal, and then once you're there what do you do with it. 

There are certainly people who live around the world constantly moving, but aside from that... meh I don't see a use for it. 

Don't get me wrong I appreciate minimalsim for the fact that owning less means less work but there is such a thing as dimishing returns. Cleaning a 5 bedroom house filled with crap floor to ceiling takes a LOT of time, I wouldn't want to live like that. But the difference between owning 5 pairs of pants and 4 pairs of pants is almost negligable. 

Once you've gotten down to a small number of items or at least down to the point where youv'e removed all clutter and excess things kind of stop getting in the way, and sometimes, NOT having them starts to get in the way. I think the kitchen is a great example of this. Having 1 frying pan might sound awesome but there are a lot of dishes I prepare where I'm running two pans plus the oven at the same time. 

What it comes down to is all lifestyle. When I was in my 20's I needed very little because I just didn't cook, I ate out all the time. I didn't need hobbies because I had 30 friends I was trying to keep up with doing all kinds of things out and about. I didn't need a TV because I was never home. Those kind of things. Contrast that to where I am now with my kids.... My needs have only grown a little but what I consider ""essential"" to living comfortably...well that's a whole nother story. 

But I don't mind you or anyone else (not that what I think matters in the first place :) ) going after the more extreme versions of it as it allows me to reflect on what I own. I often feel that where you are in life has the largest impact on this lifestyle. College or just out of college is Very different than most people who've settled down or own a house let's say. Neither is better, but they are different. 

If you really want an answer sure, I could do with out everything but clothes and a pocket knife, but that was in the army and it wasn't the most fun or comfortable I've ever been by far. I could do without my pool, but it's 93 out today and I'm glad that I own one, along with the 40 things I need to take care of just that.

* Dostoevsky
* Nietzsche again
* Being and Time/Heidegger
* Kierkegaard
* A decent chunk of pro-life stuff who's author I have since forgotten
* Is Peter Singer right wing? I covered him 
* Dworkin
* Some academic arguments in favor of the Iraq war, the Golf war, interventions in Africa and so on
* Lots of classics like Locke, Hobbes, Mill etc
* 70s/80s era economists like Freidman
* A lot of history on the post-war consensus, the Bretton Woods system etc

So far out of the WCQ's
Central America WCQ: Trickstar Sky Striker
Oceania WCQ: Trickstar Sky Striker
South America WCQ: Pendulum Magicians
North America WCQ: Gouki 

We have one more WCQ left and that is the European WCQ that is this weekend. After that the next major event is the World Championship. The European WCQ is probably the last big event under the current format.

When this format started before Dark Saviors release Gouki was the best deck. Sky Striker has seen it make it's way in a lot of decks with Trickstar Sky Striker being the best with around 37.5% of all tops (this has been the lowest % it has been in a while since it became a thing). Pure is only tier 2 partly thanks to no needle and the new time rule screwing out its play style in the current TCG.

If all the versions of Sky Striker are added together under the current list they would just be under 50%. This doesn't take into things like Gouki Sky Striker or Spyral Sky Striker or any other versions of Sky Striker currently not under the list as these usually just fall under Gouki or Spyral for example. If those we added Sky Striker variants probably would be 60%+ which would make them close to a tier 0 engine. This I believe isn't as good as Zoodiac variants as this time last year they were at least 65% most of the time.

Tell that to the surrounding nations (and europe nations) that have to deal with the effects of a fight against a CIVIL! insurgence.


Afghanistans government may have hidden the responsibles. But those were single members of one *private* organisation (a powerful one, with actual power, to be fair, but still). Not a whole nation like it was with Japan. The Hospitals or wedding crowds that got bombed didnt hide them.


You know, german bundeswehr missions have to get verified by the Bundestag. On one occasion, a german politican advocating *for* our support said the lines 'Die deutsche Sicherheit wird am hindukush verteidigt' (translates to 'german security is being protected at the hindukush).

That phrase is one of the most famous and most mocked phrases in german post-war history because of its hilarious claim that germanys security is endangered by some radicals thousands of miles away. Yet americans still believe in this bs.


Dude what are you talking about.
If you speak german i can literally send you dozens of articles in 'der Stürmer' or 'völkische Beobachter' that reach far into the late 30s and even 40s that *clearly* stated that the german people fight for their freedom tomorrow.

The treaties werent that important for hitlers rising at all, since every single government during the weimar republic (averaged at 8 months/period, so there were plenty) wanted to get rid of the 'versaille dictat'. What does 'unite the germans' even mean. That happened some time before even the first world war. An unstable political climate (as stated, 8 month/government), streetwars between rightwingers and communists, propaganda (which the right wing was way better in since they had the money with people like hugenberg) and internal fights about power were reasons of hitlers rise. The treaties themselves - not so much.

Also, the pan german movement (though they existed way before the great war) actually used the versaille treaties to gain popularity and to raise nationalism.


The fact you think nazis were responsible for the autobahn shows that you clearly have not the knowledge on the subject of german WW2 to really talk avout it. The autobahn was a thing during the weimar republic introduced by adenauer. Thats something every german 7th grader knows. The nazis simply used those plans to get a quick rise in employment and war efforts. (Though IIRC the railroads and horses were way more important for the war than the autobahn, so more of a propaganda thing and to show people the nazis kept promises like getting rid of unemployment)

On June 23, 2016, 52 per cent of Britons who participated in the Referendum voted to leave the European Union. About 70 per cent of MPs purporting to represent them favoured remaining in it.

On June 8, 2017, approximately 85 per cent of General Election votes cast went to parties whose manifestos and candidates pledged to respect and implement the Referendum result. Many of those pledges were, in hindsight, self-evidently made dishonestly.

The passage through Parliament of the EU Withdrawal Bill succeeded via mostly knife-edge votes, even with a Remain-dominated Government patently half-hearted about Brexit making concession after concession to anti-Brexit Leftists, ‘liberals’ and ‘Conservative’ Remainers alike, merely to avoid defeat.

Include the mostly Tory and a few Labour MPs who voted Remain but grudgingly accept the Referendum result, and it’s obvious that, viscerally, a majority of the political class would prefer to find a way of ensuring Britain either stays in the EU or ‘exits’ largely in name only.

The same attitude is discernible elsewhere within what we’re accustomed to calling the Metropolitan ‘liberal’ elite but what Martin Durkin, maker of Brexit: The Movie, labels the New-Class Establishment.

For the past two years much of the media has gleefully reported, even embellished, every claim, however implausible or parti pris, that leaving the EU will bring about economic and societal catastrophe, while justifying the EU’s negotiating intransigence and (though not without good cause, but for the wrong reasons) criticising Britain’s approach.

The Academy, 80 per cent in favour of Remain, has continued to suggest the imminent demise of cross-border tertiary education. The cultural establishment paints a picture of impending artistic desertification. One wonders how the 150-odd countries, including most of the G20 economies, which aren’t in the EU but manage to trade quite succesfully with its member states, manage to survive at all.

Now remember what happened to the most prominent of those dire pre-Referendum economic predictions. Goldman Sachs forecast a recession by early 2017, Credit Suisse a 1 per cent fall in GDP, and Nomura a 1. 3 per cent fall. Instead, economic growth accelerated.

The Treasury – architect, co-ordinator and centrepiece of George Osborne’s Project Fear – predicted the loss of half a million jobs. Instead more than a million have been created, and unemployment is down to a 43-year low. Overvalued anyway in the run-up to the Referendum, the pound rebounded from its immediate post-Brexit slide to its former level.

Next, recall the condition of the EU itself: Brexit is almost the least of its structural flaws. Economically, despite its expansion from six to 27 member states, its shares of both world trade and GDP are declining, and most future global growth is overwhelmingly expected to come from emergent non-EU economies.

Politically, the EU is beset with problems that pose a direct, almost existential, threat to its integrationist philosophy. The amount of central-bank-held euro-debt is deemed unsustainable. Its Mediterranean migrant crisis remains intractable and unsolved, with Italy now taking matters into its own hands.

In country after country, voters are electing openly anti-EU parties , exasperated at how its supranationalist anti-democracy ignores or dismisses their legitimate concerns about unemployment and economic imbalances attributable to the euro, the links between uncontrolled mass immigration, crime, security, and Islamist terrorism, and issues of culture and identity. It responds largely by hectoring and bullying.

Finally – and this ought to be painfully obvious by now, even to the most partisan Remain-voting, Brexit-regretting EU-phile – despite its multi-fronted crises, Brussels has zero interest in negotiating, in good faith, a mutually-beneficial separation settlement, as a precursor to a comprehensive agreement on the future relationship between itself and a former member which, despite withdrawal, wishes to continue a close but non-political arm’s-length relationship with it.

The EU’s aim, explicitly stated, is to punish Britain, even at the cost of inflicting damage on itself or its member states, for having the audacity to abandon the Project, to deter others from following a similar path.

And yet, faced with all this evidence, a majority of the ‘liberal’ elite would rejoice should the democratic will be overthrown and Brexit either not happen at all, or happen only cosmetically, or be so mishandled as to bring about a re-joining in a few years, even on punitive terms.

So why are the ‘liberal’ elite so instinctively EU-phile?

Once, I thought that EU devotees, though wrong, at least had an honourable viewpoint, in that they felt the economic, trade and employment benefits of membership outweighed its democratic deficit. I gradually came to the conclusion, however, that for many their EU-philia was not despite its democratic deficit, but because of it.

The past two years have strengthened that conviction. My theory, for what it’s worth, is that their EU-philia, despite their protestations to the contrary, isn’t driven by concerns about the economy, trade and jobs, but by something deeper: an atavistic aversion to mass democracy itself.

First, it’s a convenient cultural signifier: a means of virtue-signalling, if you like, that they, unlike the unsophisticated and mostly non-metropolitan masses, are open, internationalist, cosmopolitan, ‘tolerant’ (ha!) and ‘liberal’ (ha!)

Secondly, it seems increasingly hard to deny that, for so many, the overriding attraction of EU membership is that it enables as much politics as possible to be made immune from the need for popular consent – to be put beyond the reach of the capricious domestic democratic process and the electorate whose views they not only do not share, but for whom they actively feel contempt.

If I’m right, then this has implications for the reform of our post-Brexit Parliament and legislature. To repatriate currently EU-decided politics to the United Kingdom, only to vest it in the same Parliament which more than 45 years ago eagerly gave it away, and in the custody of MPs approximately 70 per cent of whom hold a low opinion of the masses and, by extension, of mass democracy, especially when it delivers an outcome unwelcome to them, would be unthinkable, and a hollow victory indeed.

We're talking a thousand years of medieval and Renaissance castles, every noble family had one, every dukedom and county, or principality, no larger than some average US county, had at least one castle to house the dominant noble family. Then there were the other noble families in the area who also had castles. We're talking feudal society where peasants living in a few miles/km radius were all linked to the noble of the area, who had a castle.  

So yes, it's sad that some of these places go to ruin, but it would cost billions to maintain all of them, and if we did, there wouldn't be enough tourists to make them profitable. So what France and other European countries do is classify the most important ones, architecturally and historically, as national monuments. Those are taken care of. The remaining 90% of castles have less luck. Sometimes an ingenious tourist attraction can be built around an old ""unremarkable"" castle. A good example is the theme park Puy du Fou, considered one of the best theme parks in Europe, which built an entire tourist attraction around its unremarkable castle. 

Other castles survived as fancy/luxury hotels for vacationers, if they got in early in the game, and in an attractive region.

I fear that a religion - islam - is spreading and slowly taking over the world.

I read a book called 'strange death of europe' by Douglas Murray and it outlined that by the end of the century - several european countries (possibly canada too) will be muslim majority.

I was already starting to fall into depression - this just made me lose hope.

I'm very sheltered. 2017 was a very bad year for my country - the UK- in terms of terrorism. It woke me up to what the world was like.

I just lost hope. I learned about things like sharia law. About islam itself. And it just sounds awful..

I know depression feeds off anything.

But realising my country and several others will be muslim majority and all our liberal values will be gone just sent me fully into depression.

How do I explain it? I'll just start thinking about things like sharia law and get into such a mood.

I try to explain it to people on here but they just call me a bigot. They don't understand.

I just get so depressed knowing that future generations won't have the same freedoms I do.

I get into nightmare scenarios of the uk as a muslim country under sharia and it torments me so much. We've come so far and it just feels heartbreaking we won't have progressive values we worked so hard to get. Like rights for women and LGBT rights.

I think you would get a noticeable difference, yes.

Hmm, the subwoofer behind the monitors probably wouldn't sound great (I assume that it would be sandwiched between the monitors and the wall).  All of those edges could result in a lot of [standing waves](https://ask.audio/articles/studio-acoustics-part-2-standing-waves).  If you can't fit it on the floor and you have no other choice, make sure to get yourself some kind of isolation pad for it, such as an Auralex SubDude.

The reason you want to isolate speaker cabinets from furniture is to prevent the transfer of vibrations (energy).  When those vibrations are able to transfer into your furniture, they are no longer able to be projected into the room, and are essentially lost energy.  That results in a loss of clarity.  It's not a night and day difference, but it is noticeable with decent equipment.

In addition, subwoofers vibrate a lot.  I would not want to deal with my desk vibrating that much.  An isolation pad will help with that as well.

As far as the rest of the speaker placement goes, being able to spread the speakers out beyond one monitor would be ideal, but you have to work with what you've got and how much you're willing to work around sound (and clearly your monitors are your priority).  How much room do you have under your center monitor?

I'm not sure if this would fit, or how available these products are in Europe, but the AudioEngine A2+ with DS1 stands are within your budget.  This would be a great upgrade, and the DS1 stands will tilt the speakers back, so the tweeters would be pointed in the right direction, even if not as high as they would be ideally.  These are small speakers, so you won't get Earth-shattering bass, but they have a line-out, which you can use to add a subwoofer later on if you wanted.  Audioengine makes the S8, but you don't need to worry about matching brands.  Any subwoofer from a decent brand will do.  The advantage to later getting a separate subwoofer later is that you'll get controls for level, crossover frequency (how high of frequencies the subwoofer will play), and phase.  These controls will allow you to adjust the sub to integrate into your system as well as possible, which is good because of the non-ideal acoustic situation you'll be dealing with if you have to place it behind your monitors.

The A2+'s also have a built-in DAC, which will outperform your computers integrated audio.  My only issue with the A2+ is unlike their big brother, the A5+ (great speakers, but out of your budget and I'm sure too large), the volume control is on the back.  This isn't a huge deal, as you can always use software volume controls.  Outside of the ones with more ""audiophile"" media players and professional programs, software controls usually aren't quite as good, but it won't make a big difference (small enough that 95% of people wouldn't hear the difference if there is one, unless using high-end equipment).

Anyways, as I said before, I can only give general advice about the products you mentioned before because I have not heard them myself.  I'm usually skeptical of audio reviews from users and publications that aren't audio-specific, as many don't actually have reference points of good audio to compare to.  I have listened to the A2+ and the A5+ multiple times myself, and I can say that these are both great products.  If the A2+ fits in your space, and is available in your area, that would be my recommendation.  You can always add a subwoofer to them later.",True,False,False,,0,1530575833,,False,0,e1osr05,False,t3_8vh0a3,True,t1_e1o2syi,/r/audio/comments/8vh0a3/need_new_speakers_for_my_pc_need_help_deciding/e1osr05/,,1535598688,1,False,True,False,audio,t5_2qhms,r/audio,public,

&gt; In a recent talk in Washington, the historian Timothy Snyder observed that Russia’s annual budget for cyberwarfare is less than the price of a single American F-35 jet. Snyder challenged his audience to consider: Which weapon has done more to shape world events?

&gt; Snyder is an unusual historian-activist, both a great scholar of the terrible cost of 20th-century totalitarianism and also a passionate champion of endangered democracy in Ukraine and Eastern Europe—and now, the United States. Increasingly, he sees his concerns fusing into one great narrative, as methods of manipulation and deception pioneered inside Russia are deployed against Russia’s chosen targets.

&gt; Snyder sees Trump as very much a junior partner in a larger Russian project, less a cause, more an effect. He worries, too, that slowly before Trump—and rapidly after Trump—America is becoming like Russia: a country on a path to economic oligarchy and distorted information. Trump’s attitude to truth again and again reminds Snyder of the Russian ruling elite: The Russian television network RT “wished to convey that all media lied, but that only RT was honest by not pretending to be truthful.”

&gt; The Road to Unfreedom is a rich and complex book, punctuated by epigrams that cast heroic clarity upon the disturbing distance the United States has already traveled to the sinister destination in Snyder’s title. If some of Snyder’s assessment seems overstated or premature, he can powerfully reply: He has perceived more accurately than his critics what has already happened. He has earned the right to be heard on what may lie ahead.

Invariance did not hold in three of these: Kosovo, Indonesia, and Tunisia. It held in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Latvia, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Britain, and America (i.e., all members states), but also within Albania, Algeria, Argentina, China (mainland, Hong Kong, and Macau -- all to close, but nonetheless varying degrees; it held best in the poorest, 2nd best in the richest, and 3rd best in the 2nd poorest for no clear relationship), Brasil, Bulgaria, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, Dominican Republic, FYROM, Georgia, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Lebanon, Lithuania, Malaysia, Malta, Moldova (very poor!), Montenegro, Peru, Qatar, Romania, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan (best hold of all of the Chinese samples), Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, the UAE, Uruguay, and Vietnam. It's a little more variant in the partners vs the average member, but it nonetheless holds.  
  
Given that this is maintained, the homogeneity of results in PISA, TIMSS, PIRLS, and IQ-tests administered across countries - [documented here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227641009_The_g-factor_of_international_cognitive_ability_comparisons_The_homogeneity_of_results_in_PISA_TIMSS_PIRLS_and_IQ-tests_across_nations) - should elicit a change in the prior to thinking that those differences are likely on the same factor, or at the very least, there's some coincidental X-factor stringing them all together like this. The likelihood of that being the case is very slim!  
  
If it were the case that it was related to SES, for instance, we should not have expected Norway to fall in IQ in a period of rising SES, as it did. Nor should we expect China to so vigorously outpace all of Europe as it does (in almost every region, including the whole of the Great West). If the IQ of nations were really just the result of some environmental variable, then we should expect Japan - which has a higher IQ then the West - to have a higher standard of living, but it just doesn't (the fit works better if you use verbal national IQ, but even then, Asians lag despite being smarter, and they're ahead intellectually despite being poorer).
  
These differences also follow immigrants, as the Chinese in America perform better by the same amount. This applies to immigrants - but then, wait, this may be due to their hardworking culture! Well, then compare them to 2nd-gens - but wait, they may have acquired their diligence by the cultural background of the home! Well then compare them to 3rd-gens or later - but wait, culture can persist even if they have no immediate immigrant contact, don't live in a city, don't live in an enclave, &amp;c. OK, so compare them to self-identified Chinese with European names who have taken the PSAT/SAT/ACT and AP tests (surprisingly g-loaded!). But wait, expectancy effects! So compare the cognitive outcomes of doppelgangers (Segel did this) or misclassified biracial youths (Scarr did this), and get the same result.  
  
The consistency in the pattern of results makes the prior - regardless of explicit confirmation by total proof of every little test having construct invariance - very strongly towards these differences being real, not being due to an SES factor, and not even being explicable by an education factor, since the Asian bonus is maintained across countries, within schools, between schools, despite their being in public schools more often than Whites, despite being adopted, and so on.   
  
There's confirmed measurement invariance for enough countries, across enough cultures, with different enough educational systems and economies, to extrapolate that it's likely to hold the same in the rest of Africa (being confirmed in a few African countries), Asia, and Latin America, Europe, &amp;c. If that alone isn't good enough, then testing the IQ-wage/IQ-income national correlations doesn't yield proof of reverse causality. The same is true for the relationship between national IQs and HIV, crime, a plethora of social well-being measures, educational attainment, &amp;c. Additionally, certain climatic variables like temperature, precipitation, and latitude don't cause IQ differences despite the correlations (that's about the level Wicherts' assumptions are at).  
  
But, lets not leave it there. There have been [tests of reverse causality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016028961300113X) for national IQs.   
  
&gt;This study finds that reverse causality is of much smaller magnitude than is often assumed by just looking at correlations between average IQ scores and socioeconomic conditions. As far as IQ and the wealth of nations are concerned, causality appears to run mostly from the former to the latter. Region of ancestry is the main influence on the regression results — and not simply as a proxy for impacts coming from malnutrition, parasites, or other factors in the social or natural environment.

&gt;The results are clearest in cases where countries have very different living conditions than other countries in the same world region. China has had far worse living conditions than Japan or South Korea, but average IQ scores that are close to those of its neighbors. Taiwanese born in the early 1940s into poor conditions on the island of Taiwan or in Mainland China recorded an average IQ of 102 (Rodd, 1959). Kuwait and other oil kingdoms have had much better living conditions than other countries in the North Africa/South Asia region, but test results that are not appreciably different.

&gt;Endowed with great diamond wealth, Botswana has been touted as a positive example of economic development in sub-Saharan Africa. For young Botswanan adults born after 1985, average years of schooling exceed the mean for young adults in Turkey, and are only slightly below the average for similarly-aged British nationals (Barro-Lee Educational Attainment Dataset, 2011). Yet, a reasonably representative sample of Botswanans, aged 17–20, all born in the late 1980s or early 1990s, received an average IQ score of just 71 on the Standard Progressive Matrices (SPM). Achievements scores have also indicated an average IQ in the 70s. Impoverished Mongols born after 1990 scored 29 points higher on the SPM (Lynn &amp; Vanhanen, 2012).  
  
Skip forward a bit:  
  
&gt;In light of recent evidence that the Flynn effect has ended in Northern Europe and a few other places, it is indeed possible that there could now be a narrowing underway of differences in average IQ between many developed and less developed countries (Meisenberg, 2012b), but note that, in light of its communist legacy, China's average living standards are still well below Mexico's. Assuming that the Flynn effect is somehow linked to ongoing economic development, won't China's advantage in average IQ over Northern Europe now widen?

&gt;Moreover, the Flynn effect does not appear to involve an increase in the g-factor of intelligence (Te Nijenhuis, 2013). Rushton and Jensen's (2003) comparison of black Zimbabweans and white Americans found that much of the difference in performance between the two groups on subtests of the WISC-R is attributable to differences in g. **The discussion in Wicherts et al. (2010c) questions whether the available African IQ scores are as indicative of g levels as scores are in Western countries, but still gives credence to the existence of substantial differences in average g between sub-Saharan Africa and other world regions. This paper thus concludes that, while changes in average-IQ differences seem inevitable, some regional differences in average g levels seem likely to continue indefinitely.**  
  
If you don't like Chuck (why? He's just as credible as you at worst), then the linked authors restate the same thing he does, with different evidence:  
  
&gt;To account for the Flynn effect, this paper has relied on conventional adjustments to IQ scores made with respect to tests that were, in most cases, administered many years ago. Wicherts et al. (2010c) have questioned whether the Flynn effect has operated in sub-Saharan Africa in the same way as in other places, but an analysis of all of the African IQ data in the various papers authored by Wicherts and associates shows nothing unusual. The average scores using conventional Flynn adjustments have essentially a zero time trend from the 1930s to the 2000s. If the Flynn effect had not yet begun in Africa, we would expect to see a negative trend in the Flynn-adjusted scores. If an accelerated Flynn effect were occurring, we would see a strongly positive trend.

It goes on, but I'm out of space again. The rest of what I wanted to say involves that you're making assumptions of change instead of actually looking for tests of change in heritability. If genetic nurture had a large effect, why does it now show up when we try to invoke it? If rGE has a large effect - the same, and so on.

By separating gender from sex, technical definitions become murky. How does identifying as female differ from simply being feminine? 

Here's my biggest concern with what you might call the ""transgender movement"". The vast majority of transgender children grow out of it. Transnormative cultures encourage children to embrace it instead of letting it pass, and it puts that at a much higher increase for depression and suicide, not to mention the irreversible damage that can be done to a kid before they can figure everything out. Then on top of it, there's draconian legislation around the world that says if you don't raise your kind as the gender they identify as, they can be taken from the parent. You're 17, so I understand you're too old to have anything forced on you like that, but a 6 year shouldn't be pushed one way or the other. Many governments would like to push them towards hormone therapy because they've had trans identity for a short time. The assault on free speech just seems like a government push to limit freedoms and its like they're using the trans community as a pawn to advance a separate agenda. 

I've also read articles about how European governments are banning post op regret studies because they fear being offensive, so it's hard to believe the face value claim that this movement is scientific and not emotional. There's plenty of people who later regret their reassignment surgery. Check out sexchangeregret.org. There's tons of stories there.

Lastly, I hope nothin I've said is construed as hateful. But to many I'm a bigot for simply having these views. Even if they're wrong, they're not motivated by hate. There's so much assumption of motive within this movement, it makes it hard for people like me to treat the movement with respect, when the movement itself doesn't treat me with respect.

I can seem harsh in my language and attitudes both online and in person but I do at least try to be reasonable. I am trying to be humble and exercise humility: important virtues for us Baha'is to practice in our speech and conduct. I have a long way to go but thank you. 

About violence. Yes, strictly. I answered questions about the Faith to an Egyptian guy I met in Turkey and it was absolutely beyond him that Baha'is believe it is better for us to be killed when attacked or harmed instead of responding with violence. Any form of violence: physical, mental, sexual, psychological is strictly forbidden for Baha'is. There are no exceptions or instances in which it's permitted (Bahaullah explicitly abjugated(?) the right for His followers to engage in external/physical jihad). 

Bahaullah has set the minimum age of marriage to 15 for both males and females. Most Baha'is marry (for the first time) sometime between 22 to 35 - at least the communities I'm familiar with spanning Asia, Europe and Oceania. Of course, it may be younger in places like PNG or certain African countries. Still, some people would consider 15 year olds to be children but Baha'is don't view them as such. We believe 15 is the age of maturity in which religious laws and obligations become binding on the individual - not least of which is declaring one's Faith or renouncing it after conducting an independent investigation of Truth.

Baha'is are forbidden from practicing polygamy, as instructed by Abdul Baha. The Most Holy Book allows bigamy if both wives are treated and loved completely equally, which Abdul Baha emphasises is impossible. Therefore, Baha'is do not practice it (and tbh I don't think any would want to).

Bahaullah was the first Messenger of God (of the 9 we believe had distinct Revelations that are still in the world today - so I'm not sure about the founders of Sikhism or other relatively new religions) to completely ban and forbid slavery. The families of the Bab and Bahaullah had servants who They freed themselves. 

Some laws are the same, or modified versions, of Islam. We also fast during our holy month and pray daily, for example. But women have more rights in our Faith, and there is no taxing of religious minorities or expectation for them to convert. We are also not allowed to lie according to the laws of Baha'u'llah, especially about our Faith - whereas Shia Muslims were permitted to do this to avoid persecution. Some miscallenous things that differ: music is not only allowed but strongly encouraged (as long as it's not promoting things like drugs, alcohol, sexuality, etc.) and there are no explicit clothing or dietary restrictions (except no alcohol). Like Muslims, we are also forbidden from gambling, backbiting and spreading gossip - also like Islam, fornication and adultery are seen as serious sins with spiritual repercussions in the next world.

&gt;The startling snapshot shows a bright blob – the nascent planet – travelling through the dust and gas surrounding a young star, known as PDS70, thought to be about 370 light years from Earth.

&gt;The black circle in the centre of the image, to the left of the planet, is a filter to block the light from the star, enabling other features of the system to be seen.

&gt;Captured by the Sphere instrument of the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope, **the planet – a gas giant with a mass greater than Jupiter – is about as far from its star as Uranus is from our sun, with further analyses revealing that it appears to have a cloudy atmosphere and a surface temperature of 1000C.**

&gt;“These discs around young stars are the birthplaces of planets, but so far only a handful of observations have detected hints of baby planets in them,” said Miriam Keppler of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Germany, a lead author of the research published in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics. However, other ground-based observations have not yielded conclusive evidence.

&gt;“The problem is that until now, most of these planet candidates could just have been features in the disc,” she said. “The advantage of our detection is that we have detected [the new planet] with several different observing instruments, different filter bands and different years,” she added.

&gt;Young planets have also previously been identified using the orbiting Kepler telescope. But that method, said Keppler, also has limitations, relying on a dimming of the star’s light as a body moves in between it and the telescope

&gt;“The special thing about this new planet is that we can directly image it, so the ones by Kepler, for example, they were derived by indirect techniques,” she told the Guardian. “In this case we now have a direct image [of the planet] in its “birthplace”, which is the circumstellar disc. This is especially important because people have been wondering [for a long time], how these planets actually form and how the dust and the material in this disc forms [into] a planet, and now we can directly observe this.”

&gt;Keppler adds that the star around which the newly discovered planet orbits is just five to six million years old, noting that the planet could be even younger.

&gt;Astronomers, she says, now have a big task ahead, carrying out observations to explore how the planet develops as well as tracing its orbit around the star, a journey thought to take about 120 years for the planet to complete.

&gt;Dr Zoe Leinhardt, a computational astrophysicist specialising in planet formation at the University of Bristol and who was not involved in the research, welcomed the discovery.

&gt;“This is a relatively young star that shows all of the indications that there should be a planet there, and there is one,” she said. “For astronomers, most of the time, it is very rare that we are really able to show a picture. We just have to make an interpretation,” she said. “This is almost undeniable, so it is very exciting. It does suggest that our idea for the way planet formation works is correct.”

&gt;Leinhardt added that it is possible the planet has neighbours, or that other planets could appear over time. “The way that planets form, a large Jupiter-mass planet would be the easiest to see … and also those large planets would form more quickly,” she said. “What this does indicate is that planet formation is ongoing in that system.”

&gt;Dr Dimitris Stamatellos, leader the of the theoretical star formation and exoplanets group at the University of Central Lancashire, was also enthusiastic. “This is an impressive discovery as this is maybe the first unambiguous direct observation of a planet that is caught while still forming within a young protoplanetary disc,” he said.

&gt;But, he added, while the discovery has confirmed some theoretical predictions, it has also thrown up a conundrum. “It remains a mystery how such a massive planet can form at this unusual large distance from its parent star,” he said. “The standard planet formation theory has difficulty in explaining this planet.”",True,False,False,,0,1530578453,,False,0,e1ovi9i,True,t3_8vnsw6,True,t3_8vnsw6,/r/Kossacks_for_Sanders/comments/8vnsw6/first_confirmed_image_of_a_newborn_planet/e1ovi9i/,,1535599972,1,False,True,False,Kossacks_for_Sanders,t5_3czby,r/Kossacks_for_Sanders,public,

Unfortunately for one of his protesters, who was wearing not only a black lives matter t-shirt, but also a LGBT button, a group of high school aged kids, including a 16 year old black male, were present to shut down their foolishness via a debate of epic proportions.  Every point and counter point that the Trump protesters in this video made was wrecked into oblivion by these kids, who were actually debating full grown adults that appeared to be in their 40s and above.

The beauty of this debate is in the way it illustrates the chasm between blacks with a brain and blacks that are complete morons.  The black LIES matter supporter in this video was a complete moron, but the 16 year old black kid and his high school aged friends were not.  In one of the sadder, but hilarious, moments of the video, the black lies matter supporter thought that Donald Trump's wife was illegal simply because she ""was from Europe.""  Maybe he doesn't know the difference between legal immigration and illegal immigration?

Liberals and liberal media would have the whole country believe that all blacks are morons that require the assistance of whites to complete any mundane task.  This video wrecks that whole ideology.  It also shows how much disdain African Americans have for other blacks who can't get it together and are willfully ignorant.  

In a day and age of safe space liberal kids on college campuses, that scream at the top of their lungs when they are triggered due to frail insecurities, a video like this is simply refreshing.  The DePaul University event kerfuffle involving Milo Yiannopoulos would have many lose faith in the youth.

Hard power- By being able to physically respond to issues in Europe, it gives teeth to our alliance. It's one thing to *say* we'll come to Germany's aid if something goes wrong, it's another to have troops already there and ready to deploy at a moment's notice.

You can also look at American military might as its chief export. If we aren't serving as their protector, then what can we honestly offer them? The Euro and the British Pound are stronger than the US dollar. They import more from China than they do from us. Diplomatically, their leaders are much more favored on the world stage than Trump is.

Just sharing from my personal experience, if you can afford a fixer upper out of college, this may make more financial sense than a house boat. At 23 I bought a 3/2 and had two roommates in the guest rooms. My roommates were great people, fun to live with, and also covered my mortgage. The house was a liveable fixer upper (everything worked but was out of date) so I worked on updating it while living here. ( I paid slightly more for really reliable contractors so it didn't inconvenience my roommates.) Utilities were 2/3rds tax deductible because of the rented rooms. After 4 years I am selling my house for 70% above what I paid for it (it helps to live in a hot market) and achieving a long-term goal of moving to Europe for work so I can easily travel on weekends. I'm relatively new to this sub so really curious what others have to say! Also, for what it's worth, I am strongly considering buying a house boat when I get to Europe. The market in the city I'm moving to is FAR more expensive than where I am now so I'm likely looking at renting over buying for a bit...unless I buy a boat ;) That option only occurred to me earlier this week so I've just started researching.

A clinical protocol of a multidisciplinary team with mental health professionals, physicians, and surgeons, including puberty suppression, followed by cross-sex hormones and gender reassignment surgery, provides trans youth the opportunity to develop into well-functioning young adults. All showed significant improvement in their psychological health, and they had notably lower rates of internalizing psychopathology than previously reported among trans children living as their natal sex. **Well-being was similar to or better than same-age young adults from the general population.**

* The only disorders more common among trans people are those associated with abuse and discrimination - mainly anxiety and depression.

These are not the ravings of a deluded Brexiter. On the contrary, they are the views of, respectively, the president of France, the chancellor of Germany and the president of the European Commission.
&gt; 
&gt; Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel and Jean-Claude Juncker were speaking before last week’s EU summit. The agreement reached there on migration allowed the three leaders to claim modest progress. But there is no doubt that internal pressures on the EU are mounting. With populist and nationalist politicians in power in Italy, Poland, Hungary, Austria and Slovenia, it is becoming harder to form an EU consensus. Further rows on migration, reform of the eurozone and the EU budget are all but guaranteed.
&gt; 
&gt; External pressures are also mounting. Donald Trump’s hostility to the bloc becomes plainer by the day. Last week the US president tweeted that the EU was “set up to take advantage of the US”, a dramatic departure from America’s traditionally supportive attitude. In a couple of weeks’ time, Mr Trump will hold his first summit with another leader with a considerable animus against the EU: Russia’s Vladimir Putin. The EU’s political leaders have reason to watch that meeting with real apprehension.
&gt; 
&gt; If Mr Trump follows through on his threat to levy huge tariffs on European cars, the pressures on EU leaders will only increase. Yet, oddly enough, the Trump administration may be doing the bloc a favour. Just at the time that internal tensions are building among the 28 member states, the US is reminding them of the importance of a collective defence of European interests.
&gt; 
&gt; European leaders are intensely aware that America’s EU strategy (as well as China’s and Russia’s) is likely to be an effort to “divide and rule”. With its 28 national governments (soon to be 27) and ponderous governance structure, the EU is a tempting target for such tactics. But, for all their differences, the bloc’s leaders understand the strategic importance of their unity on trade, particularly if a global trade war is indeed in the offing.
&gt; 
&gt; Small countries are at the mercy of American pressure on trade. But the EU’s economy is collectively larger than that of the US. The size of the European internal market offers its nations some form of protection against bullying from Washington, as well as the possibility of meaningful retaliation. Indeed, further retaliatory measures are being prepared in Brussels should the US carry through on its threats to the European car industry.
&gt; 
&gt; The EU’s awareness of the strategic and economic value of its internal market is reflected in the strong and unified position it has taken on the Brexit negotiations. British attempts to “cherry pick” some of the internal market’s benefits have been firmly rebuffed. At a time of division on so many other issues, the EU27 seem to be relishing their unity and power in the Brexit negotiations.
&gt; 
&gt; Evidence of EU strength is badly needed because the cracks that were papered over at the Brussels summit last week are bound to open again, soon. The plan to create processing centres for asylum seekers inside and outside the EU has big practical, political and legal hurdles to overcome. It fails to answer the question of who will host the centres, and where migrants (successful and unsuccessful) will be resettled. The package of eurozone reforms also looks thin. And an even larger battle is looming, as the bloc begins consideration of its next budget.
&gt; 
&gt; The populist tide could have further to rise, with nationalist parties such as the Sweden Democrats and the Alternative for Germany still gaining in the polls. The European Parliament elections in 2019 — ideal territory for protest voters — could dramatically change the tone in Brussels. At that point, the traditional federalist strategy of calling for a strengthening of the powers of the parliament could backfire spectacularly. The barbarians will be inside the gates.
&gt; 
&gt; As both Ms Merkel and Mr Macron have hinted, it is entirely possible that these mounting pressures — internal and external — could cause the EU to disintegrate. If the EU cannot make its migrant deal work, then countries will increasingly resort to unilateral actions, in particular, by restoring border checks to stop internal flows of migrants. That would imperil the bloc’s cherished Schengen zone of passport-free travel. The failure to agree deep reforms to the eurozone also puts the threat of the break-up of the euro back on the table.
&gt; 
&gt; But the risks involved in the break-up of the single currency are likely to remain a powerful constraint on the radicalism of the populists. The EU retains a remarkable ability to turn outsiders into members of the club. Witness the transformation of Alexis Tsipras, the prime minister of Greece, who in three years has changed from socialist firebrand to smooth-talking, tax-cutting, European federalist.
&gt; 
&gt; It is distinctly possible that the current generation of populists will undergo similar transformations as they realise the value of EU membership and the risks of breaking up the club. If so, the EU could yet shake off its troubling bout of leprosy, and confound the critics once again.

That machinery that was built to win WWII is still in use in many shops and has helped make American production obsolete.  American workers are technically behind those in Germany, Japan, China and elsewhere.  

They can have their 18-th century jobs back, no one wants them.  The Chines and others will continue to move ahead while the US continues to slip backwards.  

Most jobs were exported as a plan by the US Federal Reserve Bank.  It was part of a plan for foreign countries to make products and be paid in US dollars.  All trade was to be conducted in US dollars, which allowed for the Federal Reserve to print huge amounts of money and since it was accepted world-wide it didn't hyperinflate.

Fast Forward to the 21-st century, the world has been looking for alternatives to settling their accounts in and other currencies to hold in reserve.  The Chinese since 2015 have been implementing swap agreements with most of the countries of the world, so that trade can be conducted in Renminbi and local currencies by-passing the dollar, forcing the interest on US treasuries to rise, destabilising the US economy.  It is the prime reason for the Tariffs, to scare China and the EU away from dropping the dollar.  But, it is not working as China is far along on their plan to have the renminbi and local currencies replace the dollar.

China and a number of countries since 2018 have sold off over 500 G$ in treasury notes.  The lack of interest in securing America's debt will result in the total collapse of the US economy.  No amount of repatriated factories will save the US from full bankruptcy.  None of they will even have the cash to operate.

I'm in favour of the China plan and I hope the US panics and does whatever it takes to give China the power they are seeking.

I was excited and hoping for the more immersive experience. I most likely got my hopes up. I have been following the scene for awhile and am loving what I see coming out of Europe but that is too far for me. I have been to your location for Comedy Night, I think space wise you could pull it off with very little extra visual help. So maybe if it grows you can slowly add to make the experience more immersive or just for special artists. Lighting is important but I think for Vaporwave it needs props too. Since a lot of it visually is about the ambiance. Like you said though, if you want it to be just a free show and don't want to put in the energy for that. Then sure, that is the right path. If you want to really bring the scene here, then free or not, I don't think that will really do it. So definitely depends on your end goal.

&gt;some farmers from the Zagros Mountains migrated eastwards eventually to the Punjab area and its surroundings. THEY migrated before 5000 BC, and eventually, they coalesced into the Indus Calley Civilization around 3000 BC.

No. We don’t know the origin of the IVC people, we don’t know who they were, where they came from, how long they had been living there. There is some DNA work ongoing from skeletal remains from the IVC period found in Rakhigarhi in Haryana, but the results have not yet been released.

The IVC people were not the first farmers in the subcontinent. Farming was already thousands of years old in India at the time of the IVC. The oldest evidence of farming is from Mehrgarh, in what is now Pakistan, dating to about 9,000 years BP. We don’t know if this was a diffusion from the middle east, and if it was a diffusion, did it accompany the movement of people or was it simply a spread of knowledge.

What we **do** know is that there is a discontinuity at Mehrgarh between the early neolithic farmers and the later chalcolithic people, who arrived later. The closest affinity of the early neolithic farmers is to the current population of northwest India, particularly Rajasthan.

&gt;Many of the IVC inhabitants stayed there in the IVC, and some migrated towards the south. The ones that stayed adopted IE languages. The ones that migrated southwards continued speaking their Dravidian languages.

No:

* There is no evidence that the people of IVC spoke a Dravidian language. We don’t know what language they spoke.
* There is no evidence that anyone migrated south from the IVC. The best guess at present is that they migrated **east** when the IVC area dried out, from the plains of the Indus to the plains of the Ganges.

&gt;Agriculture was spread to south India by these Dravidian farmers who were migrating away from the Indo-Europeans

As I said, there is no evidence anyone migrated south from the IVC. Additionally:

* There is no evidence that any migration was triggered “away from the Indo-Europeans”. This is a dead and discredited theory. The I-E speakers arrived in a trickle, over 2,000+ years. There is no archaeological evidence of warfare between them and the local inhabitants, no mention of any warfare in the oldest Hindu epics. No evidence that anyone was driven away.
* When people did migrate away, it was because of climate pressure. IVC settlements were usually located on river banks, and when many of these rivers ran dry, people **moved east** (not south) to rivers on the Ganges plain.

&gt;was agriculture introduced around 1500 BC by dravidians migrating southwards?

Farming is much older in south India than that, so it **couldn’t** have been the result of any Dravidian people migrating south to avoid the Indo-Europeans

The oldest neolithic sites with evidence of agriculture in south India are from Karnataka. Some of them appear to be as much as 5,000 years old (tentatively dated to around 2,800 BC), but the earliest with a firm and reliable date is from 2,300 BC. This was during the Mature Harappan phase of the IVC, so **nobody was migrating away from the IVC at the time**. People did not start migrating away until the climate changed abruptly around 2,100 BC, when the Aravalli orogeny changed the course of northwestern rivers.

If you look at the chronology of agriculture in the subcontinent, it kind of goes like this:

* Mehrgarh in Pakistan at 8,000 – 9,000 BP
* Various Pre-IVC and IVC cultures across northwestern India beginning around 7,500 BP
* Bihar and Orissa around 5,000 BP
* The ash mound culture across the western Ghats and Maharashtra around 5,000 BP.
* Lots of Neolithic sites in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu around 4,500 – 5,000 BP.

Now we don’t know exactly how agriculture spread through these regions, was it through the movement of people, or was it simply knowledge of farming percolating through. But you can see from the timeline that agriculture began in south India while the IVC was still flourishing, so it can’t have anything to do with Dravidians driven away by I-E people.",True,False,False,,0,1530592706,,False,0,e1p9dnc,False,t3_8voofx,False,t3_8voofx,/r/AskAnthropology/comments/8voofx/when_and_how_did_farming_spread_to_south_india/e1p9dnc/,,1535606450,15,False,True,False,AskAnthropology,t5_2wl4u,r/AskAnthropology,public,

-1. Stop talking out of your ass. 

&gt;Look at Canada. People there die at much higher rates because although it's free, it's insanely less available.
 
Find me a statistical source on that. Meanwhile, here's one that refutes it: https://www.factcheck.org/2007/12/comparing-health-care-in-canada-to-the-us/

They have longer wait times for non-emergency treatment. However, THEY CAN SEE PRIVATE DOCTORS IF THEY DON'T WANT TO WAIT. 

-2. Who in the fuck said that someone making 160k would be taxed the same as someone making $80MM? Are you limited to what has been tried before, or are you aware that we can try something new? I would NEVER tax someone making less than $10MM 50%, because all the programs I want to see put in place are affordable *without a deficit* once you tax people at 50% who surpass 10MM per annum. Sorry, 5MM will have to be enough. Don't like it? I don't really care because you're wiping your ass with hundred dollar bills while children in *THE FUCKING UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ARE DYING FROM DIRTY DRINKING WATER*. 

Stop saying that socialized programs don't work within a capitalized system. Yes they do. First, we *ALREADY USE THEM*. Second, it works on a far grander scale in multiple European countries that have healthcare systems that far surpass that of either the US or Canada, and the myth that the United States finds *all the groundbreaking drugs* is hilarious. Want to keep us on our current (albeit declining) level of ingenuity? Great. Let's take some of that military budget that's funding the military-industrial complex and toss it at education and research. Boom. Let's put 10% of our budget every year toward science. I bet within 10 years you see the same phenomenon that occurred when NASA was tasked with shrinking the superconductor: Everything gets way more advanced and way cheaper. 

I'm so tired of the bullshit that you people are spewing. You aren't even thinking. We've fucking *tried* your way for a century now, and it fucks over *half the goddamn population*. If you are born into poverty, as 1/5 of all children in the US now are (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2015/09/24/more-than-1-in-5-u-s-children-are-still-living-in-poverty/?utm_term=.d22b2b5caf9d), then you will not be given the tools to ""pick yourself up by the bootstraps"". That is a fucking outlier, and close enough for most of those who are impoverished to be a myth. Almost NO ONE escapes poverty. How could they? I am an employer, I think about this regularly, and *even I* don't want to hire someone who needs to be taught basic reading and writing skills. That's not a matter of intelligence, that's a matter of education. 

Open your damn mind. You have been tricked and lied to by people who are either purposefully misleading you because it benefits them, or were tricked and lied to themselves and learned wholeheartedly to fight against their own interests.

50% of the fucking US wealth being in the hands of 1%, the three richest men in the US owning more wealth than the bottom 50%, that IS NOT OKAY. That shouldn't be possible, even by REPUBLICAN STANDARDS. Monopolies are rising again. They make men KINGS. They are FAR more powerful in their buying power than any king ever was, and that equals so much soft power alone, and probably a lot of hard power that we never see.

Many theories have been suggested as to why TEFL attracts some of the strangest cross-section of society outside that of a mental institute or the sex offender wing in a prison. It’s almost as if the entire industry is a refugee camp for losers, or a pilgrimage for those looking to find the answer as to why their respective society just doesn’t like them.

“I just couldn’t find a job I wanted at home,” laments one, or “England has no culture, it is so boring living there,” bemoans another. However, reading between the lines you will see that the truth is very different: nobody wanted to give you a job and you couldn’t get a girlfriend.

The vast majority of TEFL teachers are male – I will cite the aforementioned lack of a girlfriend as a main motivator – have a drink problem, are guaranteed to never have had more the 1000 pounds to their name at any one time and will probably be running away from something back home.

They will be society’s under-achievers, or just people who were lucky enough to be born in an age where degrees grew on trees and polytechnics counted as real educational establishments.

While the world’s economies are faltering, the TEFL industry is booming with an influx of cheap flexible labour creating a kind of economic ulterior universe, an unreality where-by a man with little or no qualifications, no discernable talent in anything, is guaranteed a job in some of the most exotic locations on the planet. An economic model that philosophically underpins the disconnected and soul-less existence of a TEFL teacher.

The TEFL teacher is notoriously badly dressed, possibly a combination of a lack of money and self-esteem, being easily spotted by their baggy polyester trousers, over-sized short sleeve shirt and cheap rubber shoes. They will be highly sexually frustrated and, depending on age, quite often a failure in their “true” path in life, whether it be a writer or a musician.

They usually have a wealth of stories about past adventures, many very interesting, yet all too often revolving around the excessive consumption of alcohol and a regretful sexual encounter. The more detached from his native society he becomes the looser his grasp on reality, resulting in a break down of the fundamental moral and social standards that he used to so tirelessly uphold.

It’s not his fault, he has simply succumb to draws of what in the industry is known as TEFL Madness – it can happen any time between 2-15 years after the first entry into the industry, but seems to fully manifest itself at around the 10 year mark.

TEFL Madness has many symptoms, some of them are often misdiagnosed as more well known personality disorders such as Bi-Polar or ADHD, but I assure you they were once pleasant, well adjusted people. A person with TEFL Madness will often display an over-inflated ego combined with an intense air of self-righteousness mostly originating from a strong conviction that no matter how badly you do your job, no matter how many corners you cut and no matter how many people you manage to drunkenly offend, you are still vastly superior to the natives around you and pretty much everyone who still “stupidly” inhabits your home country – and you are most definitely sure that you have the best job in the world.

This delusional combination of feigned superiority and ignored failure can be fatal, leading the teacher down a path of physical and mental self-destruction often resulting in death, possibly from heart failure, depression or an incurable STD. There have been no reported cases of anyone who has worked as a TEFL teacher for more than 15 years living into their 70’s.

So what is the outlook for one diagnosed with TEFL? Many ex-TEFL teachers are living happily back in their respective countries, however many have found the same problems with work and love have eroded their ability to resist the urge to TEFL and they have unfortunately re-entered the industry.

It has been reported that the first 2 years are the hardest, especially after new EU legislation banned anyone who has been a TEFL teacher from either owning a house or being able to vote for up to 6 years, essentially declaring them not just morally but financially bankrupt too. This coincided with the launch of a government run initiative to create a national database of TEFL teachers to give employers and concerned parents the opportunity to find out if one is living or working in your area.",True,False,False,,1,1530602061,,False,0,e1pfecm,False,t3_8vgdkb,True,t3_8vgdkb,/r/TEFL/comments/8vgdkb/weekly_rtefl_quick_questions_thread_july_02_2018/e1pfecm/,,1535609238,0,False,True,False,TEFL,t5_2qq76,r/TEFL,public,

The bigger issue is of course destruction of the family that results from factors including feminism.

And cybercriminals gained legal fibre by threatening companies with a penalty for data theft under the GDPR. This regulation has been in force since 25 May 2018 and provides for penalties of up to 20 million euros or 4% of the previous year's turnover in the event of data theft.

The security company Tad Group has detected a form of ransomware of a slightly different nature from the others. Nicknamed ransomhack by the Bulgarian publisher, it differs from traditional ransomware in that data is not blocked, but it is made public unless a ransom is paid. By making them public, cybercriminals place victimized businesses under the yoke of GDPR sanctions. The latter requires companies to ensure a high level of data protection.

**1000 to 2000 dollars ransom to avoid a sanction GDPR**

Cyber pirates therefore try to push organizations to make an error and bet on the fact that they will prefer to pay a ransom rather than be investigated and punished. The economic equation is easy, paying a ransom of between $1,000 and $2,000 in cryptocurrencies or risking a fine of up to $20 million or 4% of turnover.

At the same time, paying the ransom also carries a risk, as in the GDPR, companies that have suffered a data breach have 72 hours to report the incident. If they forget, they can be punished. Not to mention the bad publicity and the impact on customers.

Cyber pirates are surfing the GDPR wave because the terrain is favourable. Many companies are behind in the implementation of European regulations and are therefore vulnerable. Of course, the regulatory authorities are tolerant provided that the companies have started to work on the implementation of the GDPR.

**The ransomware does not weaken**

In France, the ransomware phenomenon is growing even if complaints are relatively low, as shown in the report on the state of cyber threats by the Ministry of the Interior. In 2017, 420 procedures were filed with the various police and gendarmerie services. A low figure compared to the wave of Wannacry which has impacted many companies and not the least in France, Renault, Saint Gobain, etc..

It was believed that the GDPR would increase the level of security for businesses. On the other hand, one was far from imagining that it could be used as a means of blackmail to obtain a ransom...

&gt; 
&gt; In its latest financial results Belfast Harbour reported a 6.5 per cent rise in turnover to £61.9m, while operating profit grew by 5.6 per cent to £34m in the year to December 31.
&gt; 
&gt; The growth in turnover and profits was supported by a 3 per cent increase in port cargo handled to a record 23.7m tonnes, and additional income from the Harbour's successful property developments in its City Quays river front offices and AC Marriott Hotel, plus new Film Studios on the North Foreshore.
&gt; 
&gt; During 2017 the Harbour invested £42m in new port facilities and regeneration developments across its 2,000 acre estate and further capital investment plans in Belfast total £132m. They include the £60m upgrade of the port's ferry and container handling facilities, as well two developments at City Quays - a new 900-space multi story car park, currently under construction and a 50,000 square foot Grade A office building, which is awaiting final planning approval.
&gt; 
&gt; The planned upgrade of ferry terminal facilities is in support of a major investment by Stena Line in new larger Roll-On/Roll-Off ferries, due to start operation on Belfast routes in early 2020. Belfast Harbour is also making a substantial investment in new cranes and terminal capacity improvements at the port's container terminal. This terminal handles direct shipping services between Belfast and the key European hub ports of Rotterdam and Antwerp, and provides global connectivity for Northern Ireland's exporters and importers.
&gt; 
&gt; Belfast Harbour chairman, David Dobbin said continued investment is a crucial factor in growth at the port.
&gt; 
&gt; ""This ongoing investment cycle has been key to our financial success and has allowed us to support the growth in trade and passenger/visitor numbers, and the creation of quality new jobs across our estate.
&gt; 
&gt; “We estimate that our current investment programme will generate over 10,000 jobs. Over 2,000 jobs have already been delivered in the City Quays offices and hotel developments, and the Harbour Film Studios.”
&gt; 
&gt; Joe O'Neill, Belfast Harbour's CEO, added:
&gt; 
&gt; “A key factor in the success of Belfast Harbour is the ongoing growth in port throughput in sectors such as aggregates, steel, animal feeds and grains, Roll-On/Roll-Off freight, ferry passengers and cruise ship visits. Port operations account for c.80 per cent of turnover and the continued delivery of best-in-class marine facilities remains our investment priority.
&gt; 
&gt; ""The Harbour's real estate activities also are delivering ongoing growth. As trade in traditional sectors such as coal and refined oil reduce, we will continue to explore new trade opportunities, alongside those in real estate and tradeable services.""
&gt; 
&gt; During 2017, 5,874 ships arrived at Belfast Harbour carrying over half a million freight vehicles through the port, while passenger numbers rose by 9 per cent to 1.5m.

&gt; In the Middle Ages, Jews were barred from a wide range of positions by antisemitic laws. This led to Jews being tax collectors, bankers, and economic advisors. 

This is actually a rather complex topic, with the migrations of the Jewish people, when/how/why they made the transition to farming to more ""urban"" occupations, and the laws and the lands which the jews were expulsed from. I would respond fully, but I believe it would take rather long to respond and would take too much room. If you would like to discuss this at another point, I am down, and have literature that you and me would find interest and further understanding in.

However, I will say that the transition wasn't really an external force, but almost an internal one. After the destruction of the Second Temple, came change of religious leadership, whom required all jewish men to educate their sons, put them in primary school, etc which made them abandon farming pretty much altogether, for this new religious norm had a ""heavy cost"", which prevented them from farming.

This investment in literacy, with their highly valuable institution of contract enforcement, gave them an advantage over gentiles in some of these ""urban trades"". Human capital is good for the wandering people.

Jews for the most part in Europe enjoyed many freedoms and protections. I will agree that they did suffer from some persecution and violence, but again this is a very complex topic of history.

&gt;Due to their over representation in these fields, they became the face of usury, high taxes, exploitation, and loss of property for a lot of people. However, the problem was/is not the Jewish people.
The problem was/is usury, high taxes, and so on lol.

Again, highly complex and different countries had different laws and policies. Though jews are the face of usury etc because they wanted to be, bans on christian usury allowed them to dominate that area of banking, the only competition that i know of in that area is gentile italians banking, there might be some other cases, i'll have to check. 

Also, their occupations wasn't only limited to money-changing, etc. They did participate in more ""honest trades"" in some places, although in some places all they really did was financial shits. 

&gt;I don't think you can really compare an individual roommate to an ethnic group. 

It's a better metaphor than most ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  

&gt;Many innocent Jews were kicked out of countries and persecuted as a result of the actions of a few Jews involved with finance. 

Fair statement, but in some places, that's all they literally did.

There were other factors which led to the demonization of jews.

&gt;There were also baseless conspiracy theories about blood libels and poisoned wells were another motivation. 


That's debatable (as being a baseless conspiracy) and a highly taboo topic that's considered unacceptable to talk about ('by them'), even more so than the JQ itself, but I'll let it go for the sake of the rest of discussion to not drown out everything else.

&gt;They were also made into scapegoats because of their minority status and relationship with Christianity.

It's never as simple as ""Haha, let's blame our woes jews because we have nothing better else to do!""

Context is needed. Do you think that jewish behavior that hurts gentiles is perhaps a better explanation for anti-semitism/their persecution, *rather than being a people who can never do no wrong because of their proclaimed victim-hood, to guilt trip you into not questioning why they were persecuted in the first place?*

I invite you to watch both of these videos, which are very interesting and revealing, and will show you where I'm coming from. They are passages from *The Jewish Revolutionary Spirit: And Its Impact on World History*.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGVyLAqhVRY

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtMN3JeR8DM

&gt;How do you feel about the contributions of Jews in western societies? Baruch Spinoza, Albert Einstein, Stanley Kubrick, Fritz Lang, Franz Kafka, Neils Bohr, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Edmund Husserl, Lou Reed, Schoenberg, Leonard Bernstein, Marcel Proust, and Isaac Asimov all had a significant and positive impact on their respective fields. I know you can respond to this by listing all sorts of Jewish individuals whom you dislike but I think recognizing the positive contributions is important. 

Of course there's jews that made positive contributions, I don't deny that. My position is, at what cost? Does it outweigh the negatives? At some points, they can be essential, at others not so much. 

&gt;I think those people are very rare. I know it's purely anecdotal but as I said before, I can't imagine any of the Jews I've known feeling this way. 

¯_(ツ)_/¯ Some

&gt;This is an attitude which quite a few of those involved with academia seem to have. It's not exclusive to Jews. There are tons of white Gentiles who are like this too.

True, I see this in crazed liberals etc. but do you think this is just the mindset of the jews over-represented in academia, etc projecting it onto the students? lol the jews transformed the american public conscience into a very jewish one lol. I even think that i read a little clipping somewhere from a jewish source saying that being jewish and ""liberal"" is one in the same or whatever, also jewish donors contributed 50% to democrats, 70% of jews voted clinton, 80% of US rabbis are democrats.

Oh anyways, their messianic complexes go waaaay back, if you watched those videos.

&gt;The same can be said about white Gentiles, especially historically.

Mabe so, but not as much as jews, which I can show historically too. 

&gt;Two wrongs don't make a right but it does show that Jews are not alone in this behavior 

True.


&gt;and since whites have grown less ethnocentric over the past 50-100 years, this isn't something that is impossible to change. 

Of course. I've been arguing pretty much the whole time that jews (with the influence of the press, academia, etc) have made whites a lot more atomized and less cohesive as a race, and continuing to do so.


&gt;With that said, I don't think ethnocentrism is inherently bad. As long as it isn't coming at the expense of other people, I see nothing wrong with Jews (or any other group) look out for themselves. 

I don't think so either, it's good for people to look out for their tribe. But like what I've been arguing, the jews have been to our detriment whether we like it or not. 

&gt;I'm aware. I used to be a communist and still admire some communist figures, including Rosa Luxemburg. Despite my disagreements with her, I think she was an intelligent and brave individual who genuinely cared about the working class.

It's ok to admire, though I think you have the right to know that, although a communist, she used it to serve jewish interests like other jewish communists, she pretty much hated the other gentile communist leaders of her party, calling them ""shabbesgoyim of the bourgeoisie"" lol. Though I won't bug you on that.

&gt;That's good to hear that you don't let ethnicity/religion get in the way of friendship. If you can see that Jews can be good people, why do you stress the ""Jewish"" nature of international capitalism and communism rather than attacking the ideologies as ideologies?

Because Jews have high prominence in both and have had dramatic effect, and I do attack both ideologies, jews and shabbos goys alike. Jews have been essential, for they are a highly vocal 
(very high verbal IQ) and cohesive group which from both neoliberalist international capitalism and leftism, have infiltrated the press, academia, finance, etc have attacked our way of life, it has happened in the past, it is happening now. 

&gt;What do you think is gained from pointing out the number of Jewish people involved in these things? 

To show that they are detrimental and are leading us down the road to hell.

&gt;To me, it seems like it would only serve to increase prejudice against Jews as a whole.

It's only a natural reaction when jews consistently try to destroy your way of life. I'm not talking about bagel shop owners, i'm talking about the big guys like in all the institutions I repeatedly say over and over and over and over and over.

&gt;You think there's a Jewish problem. What's your solution?

Here's how I feel. I really wish the jews could just live with us in peace because they could be great, but that's not the reality. I really don't want to hurt the jews, the ""civilian"" population per se. But if the jews want to see an end to anti-semitism, they have to acknowledge that anti-semitism is a result of their behavior, and come to the table. That is the first step. If the jews do not come to the table and double down on their efforts, it will not be good for either of us. 

George Lincoln Rockwell said it best:

*It is my hope to be organized and ready to channel this damned-up flood of righteous American rebellion against Jew tyranny, once it breaks loose, into CONSTRUCTIVE, rather than purely destructive directions.*

*If I am successful, we can find a just solution to the Jewish problem.*

*If I am unsuccessful, there will be Jews swinging from every lamp post in America.*

A possible solution (for America at least) is ending all aid to Israel, banning all foreign lobbying(especially AIPAC), prohibiting citizens with duel citizenship from being government representatives etc, end the federal reserve, punish all currency/stock exchange speculators, I would create a new banking system overall to free myself from the international banks. I would enforce the new bank system strictly, and punish banks harshly if they resort to predatory practices.

Any jews that own small businesses in some industries can freely operate. Jews can self-deport if they want, and I'll gladly help. However they cannot take ill-gotten funds with them. I would ban all professional-made hardcore pornography. End affirmative action for both jobs and colleges.

Just a starting point.

No we’re not talking about the World Cup: we’ve just been playing through a bunch of player-created scenarios and casually wiping out humanity. It turns out you don’t have to wait for four years to pass to see the world’s footballing superpowers (and England*) fall to their knees - just pick a Plague Inc. scenario and get stuck in.Each month we make the delightful task of scouring the thousands of player-made custom scenarios a bit easier for you all, by picking out the ten most popular and putting them up on a celebratory pedestal. No actual trophies get handed out, just supreme respect and digital high fives all round. This month with added Cat-based apocalypses, memes, and bunnies.Bunny Love by Lucky BunnyStar Wars by Cringe Lord CronanCat Apocalypse by JaggwaggSCP-016 by HellsvergPlague Zero by GinoInfinity War by Zer0sionVirus-X by HidanTsudaToo Many People by Beowulf197Fourth Wall Breach by Luigicat11The Meme Virus by knight.k.j.88Congrats to everyone above and to everyone else: enjoy giving these a play through and remember to leave feedback for the creators if you enjoyed their work. Do you feel like you could do even better though? Why not give it a go in the Plague Inc: Evolved Scenario Creator? It comes free with the game, just boot it up, dive in and get creating.

&gt; I'm a student from Europe. I'll be attending college in the US. I don't keep well and have a couple of health issues, so my father has bought a small condo in the area near the college. We're both still in Europe at the minute, and are trying to get the utilities turned on before we head out to get me set up for the Fall term. We emailed the HOA yesterday to ask if we could leave the keys (the Realtor currently has them) with them so the gas company could come to the HOA office and go with a HOA staff member to verify the gas was working, as is required by the gas company. We got an email back from the HOA saying that they won't help. The gas company has said that this would be perfect so that it can be turned on before we get out there.
&gt; 
&gt; My understanding of the HOA is limited, but as far as I knew, it was stuff like this that they're supposed to help with.

You described Wenger's dilemma as it deteriorated. He was hemmed in with limited choice. The length of time that took - with declining table standing and losing European exposure reduced the team's appeal internationally even further. It was a negatively recrudescent spiral. 

I think that lack of forward engagement made the mid-field too much about control. Instead of the springboard for attack, pulling the opposition out of position, the midfield became the holding pattern to exert control - cause it wasn't anywhere else in the backs or forward. With the back strength not to solid the opposition teams played more fluidly around them, happy to sally forth. 

A tic tac midfield is never more than a means to an end, never an end in itself. It added additional pressure on Mesut Özil to break the forward lack of penetration, with exceptional feeding. On his good days. Still he often worked beautifully with Sanchez, just needed more of it. 

I think this year will be fascinating, the backs are the most solid in the business with age/lack of pace the only concern but that's what experience makes up for.)

Added to which, the miller might have refused to sell them flour, because there was a very strong principle that each person should have their own work, and there were often laws not just about who could sell things, but to whom they could be sold.

Daca tu vrei sa devii francizat, una din conditii e sa stii legislatia cît de cît mai ales în domeniul tau de activitate :) Deci, daca e retail alimentar, de exemplu, sa stii regulile din domeniul asta, e un minim necesar si departe de suficient. Dupa aia, trebuie sa stii în ce te bagi, sa ai un plan de afacere si sa ai o estimare cît mai corecta a cît vei cîstiga si cît timp îti va lua sa ajungi cel putin la un ""regim de croaziera"" în care acoperi cheltuielile si franciza si scoti si profit pentru tine.

&gt;During traffic jams, motorists in the left lane are required to move as far to the left as possible and those in the adjacent center or right lane must move as far to the right in their lane as possible, thus creating a gap (Rettungsgasse) between the lanes for emergency vehicles to pass through.

&gt;In addition to the official laws, most drivers adhere to the following customs:

&gt;Motorists at the rear of a traffic jam usually switch on their hazard blinkers to warn approaching traffic of the slowdown.  (It's probably as much a self-preservation exercise as a courtesy to approaching drivers.)

Are you telling me that I could publish some super duper scaremongering report over whatever I like as government and, as long as I use the word ""could"", I can claim whatever I like and just add vague probabilities, knowing that it will get slightly twisted?

Yes I am! There is a massive difference between could/can and would/will. Consider this: I could give you £100k, vs I *will* give you £100k. You could die when you cross the road, vs you will die when you cross the road. It's a critical difference, and it should be reported correctly.

&gt; The treasury report IS the source.

It's not a source for ""there will be 800k job losses"", it's a source for ""in one of the scenarios we considered for unspecified reasons, there will be 800k job losses"". Surely you understand the difference? So if there is no better source than this, people need to pipe down about what economists, experts and the treasury said - because *they didn't say it*.

&gt; I struggle to recall any senior civil servants coming out of the woodworks at the time to say ""Oi George you're going a bit hard on this, no?

Their job is to be apolitical, notice how it's only retired civil servants and retired policemen that criticise government policy? Of course none of the ones in a job are going to go on the BBC and say, effectively, ""Dear George, please fire me"".

&gt; Plausible deniability. 

tin foil coming back into fashion I see. 

&gt;  do you ever remember said economists attacking the Guardian for doing that? 

Economists literally published report after report that **didn't** state there would definitely be a recession (although the reports were almost unanimous that there would be negative consequences, which could extend to a recession). These economists don't control the press, why is it their fault that the guardian and others exaggerated their claims? Exactly the same thing happens in the opposite direction, nonsense claims about the benefit of brexit are widely reported and these economists who also don't control the other parts of the press aren't able to force the papers to describe the economics more accurately.

Surely it's not tin-foil hat season again!

&gt; I need not try and convey to you in words how the Guardian has deplored, and suffered over, all the tragic happenings of the last few years! He was particularly sorry to hear such a dear Bahá'í as Paul Kohler, of Dresden, had died, as well as his wife and children. We can only be grateful that so many of the German friends have survived such terrible years! 

&gt; He is very anxious to have the German Bahá'ís resume their activities on a larger scale than ever before--particularly as they are now free for the first time in so many years. He fully realizes how great your problems are, and that you are still suffering from many shortages and restrictions; but knowing you all--and **what our beloved Master foresaw your future would be--the Guardian is confident the Faith will spread as never before in Germany, and that the believers of that country will aid in establishing the institutions of Bahá'u'lláh all over Europe.**








On February 11, 1934, Shoghi Effendi had [addressed a letter to a German Bahá'í](http://bahai-library.com/writings/shoghieffendi/ldg/vol1/sec-35.html) stating about the [Nazi government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany) that ""obedience to the regulations and orders of the state is indeed, the sacred obligation of every true and loyal Bahá'í"" and that ""our German friends are under the sacred obligation to whole-heartedly obey the [existing political regime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany), whatever be their personal views and criticisms of its actual working. There is nothing more contrary to the spirit of the Cause than open rebellion against the governmental authorities of a country, specially if they do not interfere in and do not oppose the inner and sacred beliefs and religious convictions of the individual. And there is every reason to believe that the [ present regime in Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany), which has thus far refused to trample upon the domain of individual conscience in all matters pertaining to religion will never encroach upon it in the near future, unless some unforeseen and unexpected changes take place. And this seems to be doubtful at present.""


&gt; 11 February 1934

&gt; Dear Bahá'í Brother, 

&gt; I am charged by the Guardian to thank you for your letter of Jan. 30th as well as for the enclosed pamphlet containing the address delivered by [Herr Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler) on [Oct. 14th, 1933](http://comicism.tripod.com/331014.html), on the subject of Germany's attitude towards peace, all of which he read with deepest care and sustained interest. He wishes me to convey to you and to all the members of your German National Assembly and through them to all the followers of the [Faith in Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_Faith_in_Germany) his views on the [present conditions in that land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany), and particularly in their relation to the nature and scope of the Bahá'í activities of our German believers. 

&gt; At the outset it should be made indubitably clear that the Bahá'í Cause being essentially a religious movement of a spiritual character stands above every political party or group, and thus cannot and should not act in contravention to the principles, laws, and doctrines of any government. **Obedience to the regulations and orders of the state is indeed, the sacred obligation of every true and loyal Bahá'í.** Both Bahá'u'lláh and `Abdu'l-Bahá have urged us all to be submissive and loyal to the political authorities of our respective countries. It follows, therefore, that **our German friends are under the sacred obligation to whole-heartedly obey the existing [political regime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany), whatever be their personal views and criticisms of its actual working. There is nothing more contrary to the spirit of the Cause than open rebellion against the governmental authorities of a country, specially if they do not interfere in and do not oppose the inner and sacred beliefs and religious convictions of the individual. And there is every reason to believe that the present [regime in Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany) which has thus far refused to trample upon the domain of individual conscience in all matters pertaining to religion will never encroach upon it in the near future, unless some unforeseen and unexpected changes take place. And this seems to be doubtful at present.** 

&gt; For whereas the friends should obey the government under which they live, even at the risk of sacrificing all their administrative affairs and interests, they should under no circumstances suffer their inner religious beliefs and convictions to be violated and transgressed by any authority whatever. **A distinction of a fundamental importance must, therefore, be made between spiritual and administrative matters. Whereas the former are sacred and inviolable, and hence cannot be subject to compromise, the latter are secondary and can consequently be given up and even sacrificed for the sake of obedience to the laws and regulations of the government. Obedience to the state is so vital a principle of the Cause that should the authorities in Germany decide to-day to prevent the Bahá'ís from holding any meeting or publishing any literature they should obey and be as submissive as our Russian believers have thus far been under the Soviet regime. But, as already pointed out, such an allegiance is confined merely to administrative matters which if checked can only retard the progress of the Faith for some time. In matters of belief, however, no compromise whatever should be allowed, even though the outcome of it be death or expulsion** 

&gt; There is one more point to be emphasized in this connection. The principle of obedience to government does not place any Bahá'í under the obligation of identifying the teachings of his Faith with the political program enforced by the government. For such an identification, besides being erroneous and contrary to both the spirit as well as the form of the Bahá'í message, would necessarily create a conflict within the conscience of every loyal believer. 

&gt; For reasons which are only too obvious the Bahá'í philosophy of social and political organization cannot be fully reconciled with the political doctrines and conceptions that are current and much in vogue to-day. The wave of nationalism, so aggressive and so contagious in its effects, which has swept not only over Europe but over a large part of mankind is, indeed, the very negation of the gospel of peace and of brotherhood proclaimed by Bahá'u'lláh. The actual trend in the political world is, indeed, far from being in the direction of the Bahá'í teachings. The world is drawing nearer and nearer to a universal catastrophe which will mark the end of a bankrupt and of a fundamentally defective civilization. 

&gt; From such considerations we can well conclude that we as Bahá'ís can in no wise identify the teachings of Bahá'u'lláh with man-made creeds and conceptions, which by their very nature are impotent to save the world from the dangers with which it is being so fiercely and so increasingly assailed. 

&gt; The Guardian hopes that these brief explanations will be sufficient to guide our German National Assembly in their efforts to safeguard and promote the interests of the Faith, and that through them they will be given a new vision of the Cause and a fresh determination to carry forward its message to the world at large. 

&gt; With greetings and best wishes to you and to all the friends in Germany,... 

&gt; *In the Guardian's own handwriting:* 

&gt; Dear and valued co-worker: 

&gt; I wish to add a few words in loving appreciation of your strenuous, your intelligent and devoted efforts for the spread and consolidation of our beloved Faith. May the Almighty bless your endeavours, deepen your understanding of the essentials and requirements of our beloved Cause, and enable you in these difficult and challenging days to promote its interests and consolidate its institutions, 

&gt; Your true brother, 

&gt; Shoghi

&gt; Paradise Lost (formed in 1988 in Halifax, UK) began as one of the premier bands of the death doom metal genre (along with their former Peaceville labelmates Anathema and My Dying Bride) and pioneered the sound of early gothic metal. In the late 1990s they evolved to a more mainstream synth rock style, only to come full-circle back to their doom metal and gothic metal roots on recent releases. 

&gt; Ironically, the band is almost unknown in their home country, whereas in mainland Europe they have been extremely popular for many years, especially in Greece, Germany and Bulgaria, where they are regarded as mainstream rock stars. Although they are best known for pioneering gothic metal, throughout their career the band have also confounded fans and critics alike with their perpetual taste for reinvention and experimentation, a desire to work with producers from other musical genres, and an oft-stated refusal to repeat themselves for fear of stagnation.

&gt; For instance, vocalist Nick Holmes used a muddy sounding grunt-style of singing in the band's early duration - ""Lost Paradise"" (1990) and ""Gothic"" (1991); upon the release of ""Shades Of God"" (1992), ""Icon"" (1993) and ""Draconian Times"" (1995), he refined his voice to a cleaner tone almost akin to James Hetfield of Metallica; and on ""One Second"" (1997), which was distributed by hip hop label Jive Records, the band experimented with Depeche Mode-styled synthpop and electronica, a style they would develop even further on ""Host"" (1999). Despite criticism from traditionalists, this bold approach has also garnered them many new fans along the way, and cemented the loyalty of progressive ""old-timers.""

&gt; Paradise Lost's line-up has remained remarkably consistent for such a long-standing band, consisting of singer Holmes, guitarists Greg Mackintosh and Aaron Aedy, and bassist Steve Edmonson. Holmes and Mackintosh are the principal composers, with almost all of the band's songs credited solely to them. Only the band's drumming position has changed, with original sticks man Matthew Archer leaving in 1994 to be replaced by ex-Marshall Law drummer Lee Morris. In March 2004, Morris also left the band. Drummer Jeff Singer was brought in as a session and live drummer for the ""Paradise Lost"" album.

&gt; Paradise Lost released their 11th album ""In Requiem"" which has a heavier guitar sound and a more aggressive vocal direction than their past records. Over The Madness, a documentary by Diran Noubar displaying the impact Paradise Lost has had on gothic metal, was released in 2007.  A single named ""The Enemy"" from the album was released on April 13th, 2007. 

&gt; Their 12th studio album ""Faith Divides Us - Death Unites Us"" was released on October 2009.  The album was produced by Jens Bogren. On this album, the band shed all remnants of their poppier sound, resulting in their heaviest release since before Draconian Times. 

&gt; In 2012, they released Tragic Idol. The style of this album is in line with the previous two albums, continuing with more metal oriented songs, almost returning to Shades of God and Icon, a bit more polished and with very crisp mixing by returning Jens Bogren. Drums on Tragic Idol are by Adrian Erlandsson.  Read more on Last.fm.

Wrong. The UK is one of the most important nations in the world in terms of diplomatic power and cultural impact. We are the centre of global finance. Our security industy is one of the strongest in the world, as is our military. Our GDP puts us in 5th or 6th place economically. We have a massive services industry and numerous globalised manufacturing brands. This oft-repeated refrain that we are some small insignificant island is just categorical bullshit.

But they didn't, they made it so the narrowest majority could give them the outcome they didn't want, which is ridiculous. They just aren't that stupid. They also had such a narrow win, the scandal that came out about the Leave campaigns lies, cheating and overspending gave them the opportunity to at least put it to another vote - even now they could give another referendum on the final deal to see if the country really wants it. They could've made the argument well, but they didn't bother, they just kept harping on about the will of the people, while knowing all along that it wouldn't be that hard to change the will of the people if they really wanted to, by giving them facts or presenting them with the reality of what the Brexit deal would be. But no, they keep on pushing on with this thing they apparently don't want.

It's clear to me that they do want it, not because they think it's good for the UK or anything, not because they hate the EU or any ideological reason (although obviously some Tory MPs do have those reasons for wanting it). It's because they will personally profit from such a catastrophe. It will make it easier to force the UK into all kinds of positions that many Tories have long wanted, such as privatisation of the NHS, privatisation of the judicial system, eroding of workers rights, putting profit above all, and turning the UK into basically a tax haven. Brexit provides the excuse for all these things that will eventually see the UK becoming more like the US in all the worst ways, the ways that make the rich richer and the poor poorer. I bet anything that this will all become much clearer in the next few years. How many politicians involved in this Brexit have stakes in various companies and industries that will end up making them a ton of money precisely because Brexit happened?

I mean, maybe Johnson genuinely didn't think they were aiming for Brexit all along, but I sincerely doubt it. These people aren't incompetent, they are just fucking corrupt and don't care at all about milking and destroying the country for their own gain.

False,Darkeyescry22,1455068428.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_ulpgm,"&gt;	I talked about plausibility first and foremost, and how the argument that colder climates select for higher intelligence is based on subjective measurements of difficulty. While Europeans had to prepare for harsh winters, Africans had to prepare for the unpredictable drought seasons. I think both of those require intelligence.

You're assuming a lot here. Firstly, that these two selection pressures are identical, which is unlikely. Remember, there could have been pressure on both groups to get more intelligent, but one pressure was slightly higher than the other. There's also the sort of obvious part that people evolved for a climate much closer to Africa's than to Europe's, as we evolved in Africa.

Secondly, that there had to be a selection pressure at all. Genetic drift can still happen in the absence of selection pressure. There are an absolutely enormous number of genes that affect intelligence. It's not unreasonable to expect some of them to mutate in different populations to different degrees.

&gt;	Secondly, you aren’t thinking about IQ as a phenotype, which it is. Intelligence is a genotypic trait, IQs are the phenotypic representation of that trait which is subject to be expressed differently due to what we call genetic plasticity, which is how genes interact with the environment, changing how they are expressed.

Actually intelligence is the phenotype, whereas IQ is just a measurement of intelligence. Genotype is just the actual genes you have, which produce the phenotype (via interactions with other genes and the environment, as you say).

&gt;	Third of all, it’s important to remember that heritability measurements don’t tell us anything at all about group differences, the measurement can only be used on stable and defined populations to show how much variation is attributable to genetics.

I'm not sure why you included this. I didn't bring up heritability measurements in my argument.

&gt;	Then we need to look over the many failed intervention studies and the reasoning hereditarians give for why they fail. The common argument is that intelligence becomes more genetic as time goes on—but this is based on a misuse of heritability, which does not tell us how genetic the trait itself is but only how much genes influence variation in a DEFINED population. Heritability changes depending on how much environmental variance there is. That’s how the statistic works. More environmental variance means less genetic influence, and less allows the genes to be isolated which automatically makes them influence variation more.

&gt;	The fade out effect is actually due to synaptic changes, also known as the “use it or lose it” phenomena, which means that unused skills will eventually be pruned from the brain for greater assimilation to its environment, thus greater efficiency. Fewstudies have been able to overcome it, the Abecadarian study was. The IHDP study proved that interventions can raise G and still fade, and this synaptic pruning function explains why. Now think about how many headstart gains of up to ten points have been made and lost after the end of the program— these losses have been consistency and incorrectly described as a function of heritability, once again misunderstanding what heritability means and under what circumstances it is used.

Again, I don't know why you're including this. You're arguing against things I'm not even saying.

&gt; If you were a racist in a enviroment with a lot of people who are going to take offence to you being racist, are you going to express that the main reason is that you have a irrational hatred of other ethnicities ? no course not.

These are friends of mine, with whom I've had conversations involving far from a lot of people. They have literally never mentioned race being a factor. What you seem to be doing in this part is assuming that these people voted leave based on racism even though they've never actually said it has anything to do with race, which is the very thing that I'm trying to point out to you - that these are assumptions that aren't based on fact, but rather your opinion. You and others who make that assumption get stuck into a cycle of: voted Brexit - therefore racist - therefore voted Brexit.

&gt; Is the message of people with that kind of motivation going to appeal to you ?

Im not sure what you mean by this, could you please clarify?

&gt; That's your experience, would you say the people you know are representative of the entire population? 

Yes (or at least the parts of the population that live in areas that voted leave), in that they are ordinary people, they are older, they do not live in a big city, they are English (England, as we all know, had the highest percentage of leave voters out of the 4 countries), they did not go to university (although I should point out that this does not mean they aren't educated). They are in many ways the 'typical' leave voter.

&gt; I recently found out one of my friends is a rather fanatic supporter of Netanyahu and Israeli settlers when he suddenly got really mad about someone wearing a t-shirt, despite the fact we've had conversations close to the topic for years.

That's the difference - the empire has never come up in any conversation I have ever had with my friends. It was gone long before they were born, it's just never been a thing in their lifetimes. In the same way that countries like Zaire and the Dutch East Indies have never been a part of young people's history today (in that Zaire has always been DRC, and the Dutch East Indies have always been Indonesia within their lifetimes), the empire was never part of my friends' history.

And?

&gt;I think it shows exactly that. You cant go trough one EU country to ask for asylum in another one.

You absolutely fucking can.  That's what the rule says, it's happening enough that the regulation was created in the first place.  And it explicitly states that someone applying for asylum in the incorrect country cannot be punished.  So again, there is NO RULE that says someone has to apply for asylum in a specific place.

If they apply in the wrong country, we figure it out.  It's not their fault, it's not something we punish them for, and it's not against any rules.  How governments choose to sort out their responsibilities to asylum seekers is on them, not on the refugees to perform a site survey every step they take and make sure they didn't accidentally set foot on an embassy somewhere or cross through the wrong imaginary line before coming to ask for help.

&gt;Some of the people seeking asylum in my country claimed they came by being transported by trucks and didn't see any landmarks or signs or anything else that they could identify the country they first arrived in, so that they could circumvent this rule. The rule prevents them from getting asylum in countries beyond the first, so it does what you asked for.

This again proves my point, that there is no rule preventing them from asking for asylum anywhere they please.  They might not be granted that asylum, but that's not the question here or what I'm responding to.

No matter how many ways people here want to try and spin it or play semantics, it's explicitly stated in international law that no one can be punished for seeking asylum by the state they seek it from.  It is not against the law to apply for asylum anywhere you choose.

Excellent. To me, /r/europe has always been about meaningful discussion and exchange with other Europeans. Unfortunately, over the past year or so, the subreddit became flooded with low effort picture posts once people realised how easy it is to farm karma with easy-to-digest content. Without this policy, /r/europe will eventually degenerate into a karma-farming subreddit such as /r/pics due to its large size and broad scope.

Its worth noting that reddit has been around for a while now, so we have a pretty good idea what happens to large subreddits if moderation isn't stepped up in sync with the growth of the userbase. It is not due to random chance that some of the most valuable subreddits (like /r/AskHistorians) also happen to have the strictest rules and moderators.

&gt; **Do you have any suggestions what to change?**


I would like to see the policy expanded, for example by making only Saturdays available for Picture posts. The current policy actually results in the frontpage being filled with images on mondays as well due to the way the reddit algorithm scores posts (and images attracting a disproportionate amount of karma).

[Listen to David Yeagley](http://www.smashculturalmarxism.com/hated-white-race-david-yeagley/)

&gt;“Fifty years from now, there won’t even be any white people!” said my pathological Middle Eastern neighbor. He knew I was an American Indian, and he expected me to dance in his vision.
I didn’t. I found his attitude, and that of his angry black wife, repulsive. I don’t appreciate being presumed upon or being dictated to in any matter, especially in the matter of race. Nobody tells this Indian how to think. I’m free to like and dislike whomever I please, for whatever reasons I choose.

&gt;My two neighbors were racists, obviously. And they were making me a victim of their racism. Because I was non-white, they presumed I was a natural partner in their resentment and animosity toward the white race. I was judged by the color of my skin, so to speak.

&gt;This all happened many years ago, but, I never forgot it. Today, I see truth in the words of my Middle Eastern neighbor. White women are leaping in bed with black men, or other darkies of the world, and popping out strange-looking children. Generally speaking, the male in these incidents could not care less about the children. It’s all about sexual aggression against the white race. They’re happy to conquer for the moment, and to create ghastly, permanent consequences. Marriage and family have nothing to do with these misanthropes, nor the lusus naturae they create.


[Farming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_agriculture_in_the_United_States#Pre-Colonial_era)

&gt;Prior to the arrival of Europeans in North America, the continent supported a diverse range of indigenous cultures. While some populations were primarily hunter-gatherers, other populations relied on agriculture. Native Americans farmed domesticated crops in the Eastern Woodlands and American Southwest.

Large scale farming was done only in the Central and South American states (which is why you see far far more amerindian admix), and by european-american settlers

&gt;Ethnicity made a difference in agricultural practice. German Americans brought with them practices and traditions that were quite different from those of the English and Scots. They adapted Old World techniques to a much more abundant land supply. Furthermore, the Germans showed a long-term tendency to keep the farm in the family and to avoid having their children move to towns.[4][5] For example, they generally preferred oxen to horses for plowing. The Scots Irish built their livelihoods on some farming but more herding (of hogs and cattle). In the American colonies, the Scots-Irish focused on mixed farming. Using this technique, they grew corn for human consumption and for livestock feed, especially for hogs. Many improvement-minded farmers of different backgrounds began using new agricultural practices to increase their output. During the 1750s, these agricultural innovators replaced the hand sickles and scythes used to harvest hay, wheat, and barley with the cradle scythe, a tool with wooden fingers that arranged the stalks of grain for easy collection. This tool was able to triple the amount of work done by a farmer in one day. A few scientifically informed farmers (mostly wealthy planters like George Washington) began fertilizing their fields with dung and lime and rotating their crops to keep the soil fertile.

Also [unintended deaths happened due to diesease that depopulated many NA towns](http://www.cracked.com/article_19864_6-ridiculous-lies-you-believe-about-founding-america.html)

&gt;There's a pretty important detail our movies and textbooks left out of the handoff from Native Americans to white European settlers: It begins in the immediate aftermath of a full-blown apocalypse. In the decades between Columbus' discovery of America and the Mayflower landing at Plymouth Rock, the most devastating plague in human history raced up the East Coast of America. Just two years before the pilgrims started the tape recorder on New England's written history, the plague wiped out about 96 percent of the Indians in Massachusetts.

Also, Colombus was **punished by the Spanish monarchy** for mistreatment of the Natives and the Spanish/European government got involved to stop or reduce oppressive treatment of Natives



Laslty, even cracked (now an ""anti-racist"" site) formerly admitted America was a ""white european settlement""

&gt;Here's what we know. A bunch of vikings set up a successful colony in Greenland that lasted for 518 years (982-1500). **To put that into perspective, the white European settlement currently known as the United States will need to wait until the year 2125 to match that longevity.**

Many in the US have the opinion that ""government does things poorly compared to private enterprise,"" (or inefficiently.)

As you mention with your car registration, you have to do that differently in different states that all have different driver's licenses, stuff like that.

Granted, the US has a larger population and more cities/land mass than Norway, so it's more like trying to create an EU program with all of the state governments (and county, and city, etc.) that we have, but we also just have a lot of local resistance for political reasons.

One can believe their surrounding influences, many of them social economic, can have an impact on people and society at large. What is objected to is the inevitable determinalism implied by those who hold this belief. You are not anchored to these mores and you can reject them.

Are you saying that if Black people believed in themselves more they would be doing as well as white people on average? Because it really seems like you're trying to say that.

 Believing in changing yourself is a nice life philosophy on an individual level and might have pragmatic benefit but has nothing to do with reality that a bad socio-economic background makes people do worse on average. I'm all for telling black people to take responsibility though but why did he try to use it as an argument against the fact that they do worse because of their background? Sargon also said in that debate that Jim Crow laws don't affect black people today at all even though their grandparents lived through them and 2 generations clearly isn't enough to make it a level playing field.

&gt;How on earth has Trump been “more imperialist” than Obama? He launches a handful of missiles into Syria? Obama launched drone strikes on specific targets frequently (I don’t disagree with this policy necessarily) he lead from behind on Libya to god know what end... he fermented the “Arab spring” which turned disaster out... he ran weapons from Libya to Syria to foment a revolution there. And that doesn’t count the many times more middles he rained down on Syria itself. He also led to the European immigration crisis and essentially principally funded ISIS.

No he's not launching a handful missiles into Syria. He's continued Obama's awful policy and even increased the intensity in bombing. There have been more than 10,000 coalition airstrikes in Syria and Iraq since Trump became president. Also, I'm not here to debate Obama vs Trump, I'm asking why is Sargon supporting a president that enacts right wing policy if he calls himself a liberal?

[I guess. A bit simplistic but ok so far...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Way) 

I'm not saying third-way is representative of the global neoliberal-reality. What I'm saying is that it too falls under the global ""neoliberal"" umbrella term.

Then again, if you ask a leftist, neoliberal means Pinochet-apologist. If you ask a right-wing free-market absolutist, it means the ugly and mangled misrepresentation of Hayek/Friedman's teachings. If you ask me, it's ""government is bad up until it isn't"" (stolen from r/neoliberal). 

&gt;In reality it's the ideology of corporate shills that often hide behind divisive social issues to discreetly push for their far-right economic agenda.

You might be thinking of American [libertarians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism). Then again, I think you might be so confused that you conflate neoliberals/ordoliberals etc. with [ANCAPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-capitalism).

&gt;The agenda of selling out the public wealth to corporations, the slow but steady dismantling of social safety net like it has been happening in the EU for many years

W E W. Pipe down the rhetoric there Che, you're working up quite the sweat. 

I mean, again, this might be the case for libertarians or ""free-market absolutists"" or anti-welfare-state-types (you know, like Republicans are) but neoliberalism is actually (albeit more reserved than social democracy) for social safety nets. 

Again, you've got things mixed up. It happens when you use ""neoliberalism"" as a swear word instead of a clear distinction between the various forms of capitalism.

&gt;the agenda of inhumane attacks on the middle and lower classes to save their corporate overlords in times of crisis

I too care about the lower/middle classes dear comrade! /s

&gt;Except that little thing where they threaten them with fines or even expulsion from the EU or the EU currency if they don't follow their neoliberal agenda.

Because countries foot the bill for EU funds **IF YOU AGREE TO FOLLOW CERTAIN GUIDELINES**. For example Poland, which wants to """"""reform their justice system"""""" by anchoring it to the leading party. Why would countries want to fund a regime which doesn't want to play by the rules?

Also, I thought the EU was literally an authoritarian regime!? Why would you consider it bad that they're being ""threatened"" to be expulsed from the Union (which hasn't happened, from what I know, but heh, way to be hysterical).

Russia has nukes. But they don't want to survive. They don't want to even be one amongst many. They want to be a hegemonic power to the nations that surround them and a peer competitor to the US, something they haven't been (despite their constant insistence that they deserve to be seen in such a light) since the end of the Cold War.

&gt;It's a tragic and desperate situation from them which is why we MUST keep our relations as good as they can be. 


This is kind of strange. Look, if you want to use the conventional realist argument here then...okay. But you can't have it both ways.

If we're going to be realists about this there's no justification for an impulse to pity Russia (given that it runs counter to the interests of the West). They gave it a shot as an empire, they failed and now they're in a hole. Is the West supposed to give them a hand up as they go back to conquering various nations now free of their yoke? 

You are basically restating the Russian line, with its peculiar moral superposition where simultaneously amoral realist concerns are what matter and Russia has been wronged on some moral level because America and the West didn't treat some remnant of a collapsed empire with the respect it allegedly deserved. 

Moreover, if you use the realist argument ""be nice to Russia"" is not a strategy. The same geopolitical problems will exist regardless and Russia will want to fix them. This is certainly the case now that Russia has publicly crossed the Rubicon on a few issues.

&gt;Russia probably won't exist in 40 years.

Pretty darn optimistic. Plenty of things can happen between then and now. 

&gt;We don't want to be the people they lash out at instead of going quietly into the night.

Forgive me for being harsh but I find this absurd on multiple levels.

^(1): ""Unokabátya"" would refer to an *older* male cousin, and Maneó is explicitly younger than Evita (this aspect of their relationship didn't make it into the show...). So the correct translation would be ""unokaöcsi"" (though that one also refers to nephew), or simply ""unokatesó"" (that's a gender and age-independent word for cousin).

The ""one drop rule"" obsession is detrimental in my opinion, a better view is the ""ethno-genisis"" view that seeks to integrate the past European ethnoculture and to strive to preserve/restore that ethnoculture as much as possible while also respecting other races

[It's more complex from an ancestral POV](http://sciencenordic.com/dna-links-native-americans-europeans) with Northern Eurasians

&gt;Ancient DNA reveals that the ancestors of modern-day Native Americans had European roots. The discovery sheds new light on European prehistory and also solves old mysteries concerning the colonisation of America.

To some level of [common ancestry with the east](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3971580/)

&gt;To study the male and female lineages of East Asian and European humans, we have sequenced 25 short tandem repeat markers on 453 Y-chromosomes and collected sequences of 72 complete mitochondrial genomes to construct independent phylogenetic trees for male and female lineages. The results indicate that East Asian individuals fall into two clades, one that includes East Asian individuals only and a second that contains East Asian and European individuals. **Surprisingly, the European individuals did not form an independent clade, but branched within in the East Asians. We then estimated the divergence time of the root of the European clade as ∼41,000 years ago.** These data indicate that, contrary to traditional views, Europeans diverged from East Asians around that time. We also address the origin of the Ainu lineage in northern Japan.

Carrying an offensive weapon is unlawful. 

An item becomes an offensive weapon if it's original intended purpose is as a weapon (swords knifes guns etc) or for other items if you are carrying it with the intention of using it to injure or make threats of violence against someone. 

So yes a pipe wrench or tire iron or other tool can be an offensive weapon. That's where the whole ""good reason"" for having it comes in. Sometimes that reason is patently obvious... you have a tire iron and a flat tire / you are going fishing and have a fishing knife. Sometimes it isn't.

But just so you (and anyone else) know for the future, any OBD code should help you narrow down to what the issue is.  There are different faults for an ABS pump motor failure versus a wheel speed sensor failure (whether part failure or circuit short to ground or open).  These are all different DTCs to the diagnostic system and would help you figure out exactly what the issue is fairly quickly.  Maybe a standard $15 obd reader and app isn't able to differentiate, but something like a free scan from Autozone should be able to give you the full string (such as C2256-57).  Generally a letter, 4 numbers, followed by 2 numbers.

Also, an ABS motor and assembly replacement would be about the same cost no matter the company or car.  The only extra cost would be manual labor if other parts needed to be removed to access that system.  The ABS systems are all supplied to the OEM, not in-house designed.  And there are only a handful of systems out there.  Your biggest being Continental, Bosch, and ZF.  These 3 are pretty much the only ones used by American manufacturers and European.  Asian companies may also use companies like Mando, Autoliv, or Advics.  But in any case, your system cost will be extremely expensive no matter what.  

To replace, is fairly simple after getting hand access to the part where you can disconnect the 6 or so brake lines going in and out of the valve block (big hunk of CNC machined metal) and pressure bleed the entire system, maybe doing a few ABS stops in between bleed sessions to make sure no air is left in the valve if the ABS motor and valve assembly was shipped dry.  

Failures of these expensive parts are extremely rare (though no impossible) usually because the system is not used often.  Unless you have fancy ADAS features like autonomous cruise control or accident avoidance features.  But then the modules have a harder durability test to pass with flying colors of what someone should normally see on the road.

The most likely point of failure for an ABS system are the wheel speed sensors.  Partly because they are at the wheel ends and are seeing tons of dirt, debris, and vibrations, and also due to the long length of wiring needed to get them from a wire harness to each wheel end.  More chances for wear and tear, breaks, or failures at the connectors.

I'm fine with critiques, they're important, but often they come across as attacking the foundations upon which people have built (increasingly comfortable) lives with no acknowledgement of that fact. 

I think the cynicism is important here. His career is built on critiquing Western civilization, but his paychecks stop when he says anything that goes against the perception that the West is evil and/or a disaster. There's no money in nuance because that doesn't anger or elate people enough to pay you for it. Not unlike [JK Rowling's fans](https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2018/02/jk-rowling-created-army-liberals-now-they-are-turning-against-her) now turning on her, except she can just live off the fortune she's already built instead of needing continual input. 

There's a line between 'everything is shit all the time' and 'this current moment is the endpoint, the paradise, the land of milk and honey.' I think the correct placement is somewhere around 'Look at everything we've improved so far, but don't forget all the good left to do.' Robinson leans too much to the 'it's all shit' side for me. Lamenting that we haven't achieved full luxury space communism (or whatever his actual goal might be) without seeing that we're a hell of a lot closer than a century ago is as silly as my own false dichotomy. 

For what it's worth, I would agree Western civilization is at best a complex concept, and at worst undefinable. However, I think many critiques throw the baby out with the bathwater, so to speak. If you don't want to call it Western civilization because you think that's some dogwhistle or because it's a vague term, fine. Find a better way to define the set of values (individualism, democracy, equal rights, and possibly some level of market economics) that apparently make Europe and America the place where a significant number of people enjoy living and/or wish they lived in.

I'm reminded of [this post from EvolutionistX](https://evolutionistx.wordpress.com/2018/06/04/what-is-social-studies/):

&gt;But what exactly society is–and who is included in it–is a hotly debated question. Is America the Land of the Free and Home of the Brave, or is it a deeply racist society built on slavery and genocide? As America’s citizens become more diverse, how do these newcomers fit into society? Should we expand the canon of Great Books to reflect our more diverse population? (If you’re not American, just substitute your own country.)

&gt;These debates can make finding good Social Studies resources tricky. Young students should not be lied to about their ancestors, but neither should they be subjected to a depressing litany of their ancestors’ sins. You cannot become a functional, contributing member of a society you’ve been taught to hate or be ashamed of.

&gt;Too often, I think, students are treated to a lop-sided curriculum in which their ancestors’ good deeds are held up as “universal” accomplishments while their sins are blamed on the group as a whole. The result is a notion that they “have no culture” or that their people have done nothing good for humanity and should be stricken from the Earth.

&gt;This is not how healthy societies socialize their children.

Later:

&gt;I think of my society as more “Civilization,” or specifically, “People engaged in the advancement of knowledge.”

I can't say that, in the end, I care much if the civilization is Western, Eastern, or Up-Downian. But there's something important to Civilization, to not be taken lightly or tossed away because it's not yet perfect.

1) crappy local promotions that would appear at places like Butlins and Blackpool, as well as on stage in local theaters with names like ""Big Time American Wrestling"". Main Events usually consisted of Skull Murphy vs Marty Jannetty.

2) WWF would come to town once a year with ""European Rampage"" or ""WrestleMania Revenge Tour"", which were basically house shows and nothing of substance ever happened on them. They were sometimes televised (Battle Royal at Albert Hall, One Night Only, etc) but mostly not. Then we got a handful of UK exclusive PPVs during the Attitude Era like Rebellion and Insurrection. These days, it looks to be a Raw/Smackdown/NXT live show once a year.

Because the fans are so starved of that live action, we would pop for anything. Paul Roma vs Virgil in the opening contest would get pops akin to Austin vs McMahon, lol. UK fans today blow the roof off for people like Mojo when over here most people would use his entrance to take a piss.

If you compare that to fans living in a major US city for the last 20-30 years, chances are they've had a WrestleMania in their state or a neighboring state within driving distance at least once. They've definitely had one of the ""Big Four"" in their town. And Raw/Smackdown will come through once or twice a year. Not to mention house shows.

AND on top of that, the indie wrestling over here can be quite decent with big names coming through all the time.

Thus, when Raw is rolling into your state for the 10-12th time in as many years and opens with a 20 minute Authority promo, followed by Jason Jordan vs Barin Corbin, yeah...I'm not exactly falling over myself to drop $50 on a ticket and deal with all the hassle of parking, crowds, getting home late, etc. 

Not spoiled or entitled, just the way it is. And I honestly think if roles were reversed, the Brits would be the same. If you got steak for dinner every night followed by a 60 minute massage, it's only a matter of time before that luxury would become boring.

Arsenal and Inter also learned about Guedes (COPE)

Posted on Tuesday July 3rd, 2018 at 15:50 by Philippe Goguet

According to Spanish radio Cadena COPE, Arsenal and Inter Milan have also inquired with PSG about Gonçalo Guedes, eagerly coveted by Valencia CF.

Author of a great season with Valencia, punctuated by 6 goals and 11 assists, Gonçalo Guedes attracts many European clubs. If we know the willingness of Los Che to engage the services of the attacker of the PSG, two new clubs have also positioned on the file, according to Cadena COPE. These are Arsenal and Inter Milan, who inquired with Paris about the situation of the player. **Spanish radio also said that Guedes insists on his desire to play in the Champions League next season and that his wish is still to commit permanently with Valencia**

Still concerning Guedes and Valencia, the local sports newspaper SuperDeporte announces that the Spanish club is advancing on the track leading to Udinese midfielder Jakub Jankto in case the transfer of the Portuguese is not concluded. The player does not have the same CV as Guedes but it costs however much cheaper since estimated around 15M €. For the moment, Valencia is still waiting for a final answer from PSG for Guedes before moving forward.",True,False,False,,0,1530637536,,False,0,e1q7aw6,False,t3_8vtobu,True,t3_8vtobu,/r/Gunners/comments/8vtobu/spanish_radio_cadena_cope_arsenal_and_inter_milan/e1q7aw6/,,1535622289,2,False,True,False,Gunners,t5_2qhqt,r/Gunners,public,
