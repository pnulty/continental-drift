(therefore I'm not an expert and can make mistakes) The reason banks don't have automatic transfers is because US banks still use ancient, giant computers from the early 60's that use an outdated programming language called COBOL that literally no one but the banks use. In this programming language, they create a ASCII (or maybe hexadecimal, can't remember which) representation of a bank transfer request from the 60's, into which they can input your information. Despite this system becoming more automated over the years, they haven't updated the actual transfer method. Imagine them sending a picture of a transfer request. I can't remember why exactly they don't operate on the weekends, maybe they still need some human intervention, but the point is that banks transfers of any kind are so slow because banks are cheap and don't want to bring their banking computers into this millennia, literally. As it's been explained to me, many European countries have legislation that requires a maximum of 10 seconds to complete ANY transfer, whether you're buying groceries or sending money, so pending charges should never be a thing, especially just because it's the weekend.

Maybe wanting to avoid it encourages super long posts. Since this is completly unproductive, I won't reply further to this off topic accusation of attacking original socialists by claiming they want to give welfare.

This is not a cheap gotcha, it is not the main point, I am not even sure how I criticize original socialism other than by bringing V2, implying that it is to be abandoned. 

Hardcore Socialists wanting to give borderless welfare would be far less absolutely awful and disastrous than their actual record. So it makes little sense as an attack against this perspective. Still world redistribution is a socialist dream, even if it isn't according to all old socialism prescriptions. Especially if you include the one leg into socialism larger numerically crowd.

Socialists have long dreamed of an equalization between the standards of living of the so called rich regions such as Europe, USA, and poorer other regions. An international socialist world order. And yes, this would entail redistribution in practice, since in socialism land, judging by its practices you would have probably money, and definitely different development, means of production, etc. Anyhow it would involve redistribution of resources from richer places, to poorer ones. Just seizing means of production wouldn't cut it to bring equality. It might even get propaganda that is about reversing the consequences of imperialism. Obviously this kind of redistribution and the one regarding the OP are not the same.

Now, it is possible that you could also have socialists who don't particularly care about such regional redistribution. World, and especially leftists are a diverse place. 

The point of all this is not that these people are all real orthodox socialists though. In fact the actual bigger group of people is people with one leg in socialism, and hoping for the close enough dream rather than orthodox socialists/communists. 

But there is an intellectual space of such desires, however much infighting, misunderstanding, difficulty to correctly adhere to orthodox socialism tm because of actual quite different political space and hurt feelings it might entail.

Quite importantly, it is a valid point to consider that the failures of socialism should at least motivate some caution. This could mean caution in supporting such redistribution or caution in the amount to be redistributed from richer regions to the poor, with taking into account the possible negative effects on the country doing the redistribution (or generally the negative effects of too much focus on redistribution). And caution could also include issues like considering the loss to redistribution. So indeed quite restrained versions would be further away from dreams of a world of equality of outcomes.

It is not an article about hardcore socialists tm (because that entitles even larger assumptions that are not necessary). That being said, it is true that the association between opposition of borders, international redistribution is going to also have the problem that it might make actual hardcore socialism tm more popular, or at least motivate some anti capitalist policy. 

Actual hardcore bad socialists tm and their thought, with their legacy of failure, and anti capitalism might influence things. Or not. It depends on how restrained the whole endeavor is or how radical.

I am not Muslim or from Eastern Europe/Eastern Asia, but I know someone from Albania, and they said how they and their family are culturally Muslim, and not extremely or very religious as Muslims in South and East Asia, and parts of Africa, and the Middle East are.  They drink alcohol and eat pork, and would not require a woman wear a headscarf today, or even in the 1970s and they are not radical or even moderate for Muslims, and are culturally a lot more like Greeks and Southern Italians from regions in modern day Italy where the Ancient Greeks settled like Calabria, in many ways except instead of being Greek Orthodox, Greek Byzantine Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox, Eastern Catholic, or Roman Catholic, are Muslim, and put their country as an identity first before that of their religion or Islam.

I also know people from Serbia, Bosnia, and Croatia, and they all said how for centuries Christians, Jews, and Muslims in their countries would intermarry, and were all culturally linked even before the creation of these modern day countries.

People are forgetting that when these countries were under Communist/Socialist control or part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, many people did practice religion in secret, but because the government and these countries were all atheist, they were not open about being religious or practicing a religion, and even religious Muslim women did not wear head scarves or any sort of coverings, and they were not radicalized or extreme, or even as religious or very strict with Islam, as people in Iran, Iraq, and other Middle Eastern/Western and South Asian and African countries can be.

All of the people who I have met from these countries have told me how for them their religion is a private matter, they are not really that public about it.  It does not mean that they keep it hidden or practice it in secret, or are atheist or not religious, they just are not public about their religion, don't practice their religion very publically the way some Muslims and Christians in other countries or regions of the world do, and a person's religion is a private matter kept within family or to yourself, and someone wearing a headscarf, hijab, or wearing a veil or niqab would be seen as being way too public about someone's religion.",True,False,False,,0,1530407366,,1530413040,0,e1kwdox,False,t3_8v4qap,False,t1_e1knzha,/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/8v4qap/a_possible_key_to_identifying_beth_doe/e1kwdox/,,1535532706,19,False,False,False,UnresolvedMysteries,t5_2wvvc,r/UnresolvedMysteries,public,

Then the sequel happens and it turns out seconds after that great scene Luke just casually tosses the lightsaber away for a cheap laugh. So now if I rewatch the Force Awakens I'll just be thinking of that when that scene comes up. TFA also built up the mystery of Rey and how she has these Jedi abilities. The first movie didn't explain that, but it seemed like the sequel would. Turns out according to TLJ, there is no compelling explanation and she is just given these great Jedi abilities with no real training. The Last Jedi was not only a poor movie in its own right, bu it also retroactively makes TFA a worse movie by throwing away the things that movie built up.

Counting is the action of finding the number of elements of a finite set of objects. The traditional way of counting consists of continually increasing a (mental or spoken) counter by a unit for every element of the set, in some order, while marking (or displacing) those elements to avoid visiting the same element more than once, until no unmarked elements are left; if the counter was set to one after the first object, the value after visiting the final object gives the desired number of elements. The related term enumeration refers to uniquely identifying the elements of a finite (combinatorial) set or infinite set by assigning a number to each element.



Counting sometimes involves numbers other than one; for example, when counting money, counting out change, ""counting by twos"" (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, ...), or ""counting by fives"" (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ...).

***

**Abacus**

The abacus (plural abaci or abacuses), also called a counting frame, is a calculating tool that was in use in Europe, China and Russia, centuries before the adoption of the written Hindu–Arabic numeral system. The exact origin of the abacus is still unknown. Today, abaci are often constructed as a bamboo frame with beads sliding on wires, but originally they were beans or stones moved in grooves in sand or on tablets of wood, stone, or metal.

Abaci come in different designs.

Wages grew in most eastern European countries and, indeed, to a much greater extent than in most western European countries, where wage growth was rather subdued or even negative, especially in Mediterranean countries; exceptions to this trend were Denmark, Germany, Ireland and France. Similarly, wage inequality declined in around two-thirds of EU countries (see final column in table), although there is no significant association between the changes in average wage levels and in wage inequality levels.

&gt;Three main patterns emerge from the analysis:

&gt; - Strong wage growth (4%–12%), mainly due to wages improving more among the lowest-paid employees (quintile 1), causing a fall in wage inequality. We see this pattern in much of eastern Europe – the Baltic countries, the Czech Republic, Poland and Romania – although not in Bulgaria, especially, nor Hungary, where wages grew more robustly among the higher-paid.

&gt;- More moderate wage growth (1%–3%), mostly due to wage increases among the highest-paid employees, leading to hikes in wage inequality. This is apparent in Denmark, Ireland, France, Italy and Finland.

&gt;- Wage declines or stagnation (growth of 1% or less) alongside falls in wage inequality generally, mainly due to wage reductions among the highest-paid (Quintile 5).

The only scene with Nate is when he’s walking with the picture of Nora in hand but he was carrying a laser rifle if memory serves me right. 

I understand how you see that I may be stretching my arguments but you can’t compare our modern military to fallout’s. they are so distinct from one another that there is no way to compare the two. The US in fallout are much more similar to the European Union in our world rather than our US. 

And again, the American commonwealths each operated very distinctly from one another. It’s also the reason why you don’t see major energy companies like Poseidon oil in the east coast but instead we have mass fusion in Massachusetts. So you have to see where I am coming from, we can’t just use examples from our world even if it is logical, as the fallout world differentiates from our world significantly. In fact the fact the establishment of the 13 commonwealths is what partially lead to the US to be crippled just before the bombs dropped.",True,False,False,,0,1530418639,,False,0,e1l5e2f,False,t3_8v1y3e,True,t1_e1l3smp,/r/fo76/comments/8v1y3e/soviet_firefighting_truck_spotted_in_fallout_76/e1l5e2f/,,1535536906,1,False,True,False,fo76,t5_jrw25,r/fo76,public,

You get two votes, the first for the local candidate in your election district, the second for a political party. The local candidates with the most votes get guaranteed seats in the parliament, the remaining seats are filled up with the different parties' list candidates until the seat distribution in the parliament matches the result of the party vote. Solves the FPTP problems completely, the seat distribution accurately reflects what the people voted for.

This usually results in 4 to 8 parties with a relevant number of seats in the parliament, each controlling between 5% and 40% of the seats (absolute majorities for one party are an uncommon result and perceived as potential rubber stamp parliament, as undemocratic).

But to form a government, you still need a majority of the seats. That's where coalition negotiations between the parties begin. A stage that filters out the fringe minority parties who see everyone else as enemy and can't compromise. That also filters out the egomaniacs, the poor negotiators, the idiots. In the end you get a government coalition of usually 2 or 3 similarly-aligned parties who have to compromise and work together to keep the government stable and running. Social Liberals with Greens, Social Liberals with Social Democrats and Socialists, Social Democrats with Christian Conservatives, whatever works.

A Donald Trump would never make it through the coalition negotiations.

For those of you wondering what the heck is going on, al-Husseini was the religious head and nationalist movement leader in the British colony of Palestine, and during WWII he threw his support behind Hitler and the Axis powers.

al-Husseini was born in the Ottoman Empire, a multi-ethnic entity that as we know crumbled after WWI. In fact, he served in WWI himself. As a result of the Empire’s collapse, European powers split up large swaths of the Middle East into largely arbitrary nations. Some nationalist thinkers wanted to reunite these nations along religious lines (Islam) because it transcended ethnic divisions. Al-Husseini also hoped if nothing else, for simple autonomy for Palestine from the British. 

 It must be noted there were significant religious riots between Jews and Muslims at the time particularly concerning access to the Western Wall. Riots were not uncommon leading up to WWII. Al-Husseini wanted wanted more control. When riots, and then an outright rebellion broke out in 1939 he was accused by the British of having incited violence. It was in this climate that he gambled on the Axis Powers, and threw in his lot with Germany. Palestinians sympathized with Germany as both nations felt they’d been given a raw deal after the treaty of Versailles. 

In the end it was largely a fruitless alliance. al-Husseini toured Bosnian troops, promised to issue propaganda in Arabic favorable to the Nazi’s and Hitler sent him a couple of planes.

some friends of ours here in Rojava are currently involved in teaching English in the revolutionary youth structures in nearby cities and villages. 

If you are interested in the principles of the revolution and able to seriously commit to a minimum of 6 months (preferably more) then we would be very happy to hear from experienced revolutionary and internationalist teachers of any subject (not just English).

Of course, you should be aware that this is not going to be a TEFL teaching abroad experience, and ask how and why you want to teach (and learn). Many young people leave Rojava to Europe and we certainly don't want to create lessons which wrongly paint the English-speaking world as a dream destination where all their troubles will be solved. 

But there is also a strong need for English-language education in today's world, and it is also possible to work together with students to develop a critical and revolutionary approach to the language. The same goes for skilled educators in fields like engineering, programming, medicine, the sciences and so on...

If you'd told a Syrian in February 2011 that their nation was about to be fractured and destroyed by a devastating civil war, most would have refused to believe you.

This sort of thing precedes most major human catastrophes. Notably, in the run up to the First World War there were a lot of people claiming a war between the major powers was now impossible; it'd be too economically devastating, too suicidal. But just because they didn't want to think about it, didn't stop it from happening.

Fortunately, even at its worst, Brexit won't be as bad as either of those examples. Nevertheless, it's extremely foolish - and very human - to just assume 'it'll all be alright' despite all proof to the contrary.

So, what is the worst case scenario?

The day comes.

00:00: Dover shuts its doors. Because we've left the EU without any sort of deal or plan, there's no contingency for the vast tonnage of traffic that passes through the port daily. They cannot possibly handle the current throughput with full tariff processing; the port simply lacks the necessary facilities. The A2 and A20, and then the M2 and M20, become a single vast lorry park - Operation Stack on steroids.

08:00: The London supermarkets open. The city wakes up to headlines about the near-total shutdown of trade to our biggest trading partner.

08:05: People suddenly realise that the UK doesn't produce enough of its own food, and that we're no longer capable of bulk import. Worry spreads through social media like flames on petrol. People start rushing to the supermarkets.

08:15: Panic buying has stripped the London supermarkets clean. Millions of Londoners - I've heard 6M, but can't find a source - realise that they literally don't have their next meal in the fridge.

11:00: Londoners are starting to get really, really frightened. Roads out of the city are at a standstill, major protests are spontaneously forming throughout the city.

16:00: A very large number of people are starting to get very hungry. Protesting starts turning to large-scale rioting, far beyond the capacity of the Met to handle.

18:00: The Houses of Parliament are on fire.

20:00: The UK government has completely collapsed, MPs have fled or been lynched, the pound has plummeted into worthlessness. The banks and the entire UK economy collapses overnight due to our currency suddenly failing.

21:00: A great many people go to bed hungry. Fires rage throughout London.

The various systems that underlie civilisation will break down extraordinarily quickly, especially once the currency collapses.

The electrical grid will probably keep going for a little while, at least until people start stripping up the copper cabling. Some bit of the civil service may manage to keep the power-stations running for a little bit, the French will probably keep some power flowing under the channel, the renewables won't go down. Expect the lights to stay on even if the government doesn't, possibly falling back to rolling blackouts, then total local blackouts over weeks and months as the infrastructure gets stolen.

The mobile networks will go down immediately, especially in high-pop areas, as everyone in Britain starts making panic calls. Hopefully the phone networks will be quick enough on the ball to promise to pay their staff in foreign currency as the pound plummets, probably the EU will pick up the maintenance bill medium term, so the network may hopefully come back online - although don't plan for it.

Everyone's British-based savings will, of course, be instantly rendered worthless. The whole financial system will disappear as a factor pretty much immediately.

Within a very short period, probably a few days, the EU will intervene as a humanitarian effort. People will die in the rioting and immediate aftermath, but we hopefully won't be looking at mass starvation.

The immediate transition period (4-6 weeks) will be very rough. All of the major population centres will empty out relatively quickly, a vast wave of terrified, homeless refugees will spread from each. Expect violent crime, looting, theft. Stay off the major travel routes; it'll probably be better to go cross-country than follow the motorways.

Short term (1 year), the UK population will dip dramatically as a wave of British refugees flee the country. Traditionally, in times of crisis, populations return to the family farm, but the UK has been industrialised for so long that for most people this is not an option. Again, violence and theft will be a major issue, the rule of law will likely be patchy. Expect local communities to become very important.

Medium term (2-3 years), the UK will almost certainly collapse into its constituent nations, and even those will barely qualify as unified countries. Northern Ireland may be absorbed into the Republic of Ireland. The EU and UN will probably send significant aid to keep people from starving, and the EU will probably invest significantly to try and get the economy restarted, but expect kleptocracy and looting to have utterly destroyed most UK infrastructure.

Medium-to-long term (4-10 years), the various bits of the UK will start to rebuild, their economies will start to have value. Almost certainly all fragments of the UK will apply to join the EU, and adopt the euro as a stable currency. Starvation will no longer be a risk, but there'll be very little worthwhile employment and UK talent will brain-drain the hell out, slowing economic recovery.

Long term (30-40 years), the fragments of the UK will rebuild to medium-sized, unimportant developed nations, assuming all else is equal in the global sphere. None of them will ever enjoy the economic or political prominence of the UK, but they'll be mostly OK.

Now, I stress that this is the worst-case scenario. It is, however, a high-impact/low-probability potential future, and the day it happens is too late to be preparing. Have a plan, have what you need ready beforehand, and then hope it all turns out OK in reality.

I can't tell everyone else how they should prepare, but I can tell you what I and my family plan, and maybe that will help inform your thought process. Note that this is not Doomsday prepping. Whatever happens, the UK will probably start to recover within a few years. You need to have a plan for a transition, and options for the short-to-medium term.

I'm very fortunate in that my family has access to a large piece of arable ground, and we've just built a house on it that's energy self-sufficient, well insulated, has access to a fresh-water well, a self-contained septic tank, and a well-equipped small workshop. We're also in a rural area, with a local community that's food-producing rather than consuming.

Each of my family will have a bug-out bag capable of getting them from where they are (e.g. London) up to the family home, on foot. This includes boots, water filters, high-energy-density rations, paper maps, etc.

We will have bought in advance a large quantity of rice and grain, which will get us through the winter until we can start producing food. We will also have a broad range of vegetable seeds (no monocultures), and the tools to farm them. This will get us through immediate and short-term food troubles.

We will keep the car filled with fuel ahead-of-time.

We have enough money in a foreign bank account and currency to buy four plane-tickets out to relatives in Canada, even at panic-prices, should matters somehow become even worse.
There is a terrifying trend amongst everyone I know to just assume 'it will all be OK'. This is an assumption based on some underlying idea that our current government is lead by competent people with some sort of long-term view and dedication to the public good.

Unfortunately, if you line that mental picture up with one of our current government, the two don't line up anywhere.

Don't just assume it will all be fine. Have a plan, get your options sorted ahead of time.

It's the same reason why the age of consent differs between countries, why age of consumption and type of legal drugs vary between countries, it is why capital punishment is practices in some and not others. The law is merely an application of the values of the society it is meant to reflect, nothing more.

Yep, no law is inherently just, however no law is inherently unjust. There are many laws that are in place which work in the legal system that are supported by and benefit the community as a whole.

It's amusing that you are stating I should be better educated in history, when you are in part advocating a legal system based on your personal interpretation of the law, something dictators and fascists do in order commandeer the legal system for their own ends.

&gt; A) Most other countries are ethnostates and have immigration policies historically grounded in laws of language and blood. 

Most countries regardless of history have border controls. America is not the only 'nation of immigrants'. Canada, Australia, and New Zealand are all Western nations that have just as many immigrants as the USA yet also have border controls. Every single nation in the world controls it's borders to ensure 

&gt; B) The U.S. is NOT an ethnostate, and no argument for ethnic, religious, or cultural restriction of admission to our republic can have any basis other than a racist one. 

The US is a Western nation influenced by European culture, values and religion. Anyone denying that is denying reality. Yes there was minor influences from various nationalities that came over to the US, however they were in no way the primary drivers of what the US is today. Saying the US is not a European based country because it had immigration is like saying England is not European based because it has such a large Asian population.

However, the US doesn't restrict people on racial grounds. It restricts them on based relations with the foreign countries, the likelihood that people will not follow their visa conditions, the likelihood that they will be a danger to it's citizens, and finally whether they will be beneficial to the country.

&gt; Also it's supper convenient to appeal to ""Other"" nations practices when it suites you. Tell me; do you support socialized national health care?

Uh, as someone from Australia - yes. However we also have border control and like to determine who comes into the country as well.

This isn’t an accusation though, since almost everyone is susceptible to this. It almost plays out like the Yanny Laurel phenomenon, where your brain is primed to hear what you want, and it becomes nearly impossible to see the other side. Likewise, you can see that legitimate studies into politics will show that almost every person will have never changed their political ideologies their whole lives.

To resolve this, I found some steps to take. One is identifying key words. Human rights. What is human rights? I think you would argue it due something to natural rights and freedoms- which is? Just as a reminder, Locke stated his revolutionary philosophy that humans all deserve life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness more than a thousand years after counting years became a thing. Jefferson changed that pursuit of happiness to property another few hundred years after Locke. And if you noticed, there have never been a single slave revolt for the sake of liberty alone until 300 years ago. Spartacus, they were forced to fight to the death with each other, helots, they were often beaten to near death. If you read any historical accounts, people do not mention freedom, but rather how people use or abuse their social power in context of other people. This is just to prime your brain to think more in depth.

Many of your rhetorical questions are based on an assumption which you are arguing. eg “would it have been okay if plantation era slaves had been treated better, etc?” This is called begging the question. Again, I may have stated a possible counterargument already in the paragraph above, but that’s not what I’m getting at. As for your last statement, the Bible also made provisions for slavery, and it said to treat them well (I’ll give verses if you need, but I’ll leave it at that.)

Anyways, I agree that in modern contexts and given modern situations, slavery is bad. It is now detrimental to our society economically, which is the North in America and Europe gave up slavery quickly. And it has too much potential for abuse, especially in a current society where most people don’t think or remember that a higher power is watching over them. And with a more mobile socioeconomic class and machines, it would serve everyone’s best interest to be independent. So it’s having freedom over slavery now is good. But rules of socioeconomic and whatnot were vastly different back then. Do you know Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr? I think the way he puts it is really insightful, that laws and morality are at a constant flux, and decisions should be made based on the present state of these.

[Picture 3](https://i.imgur.com/O2H0mFO.png): This hand symbol is the Volksfront, an American Neo-Nazi front. 

[Picture 4
](https://i.imgur.com/3Ha2Zqf.png): More Volksfront and the Peace Symbol, however, the Peace Symbol is at a tilt. This tilt is the same tilt used by Ku Klux Klan. Usually, the Klan also has a Nazi-Salute with the other hand.

Nazis are a strange type of people. They know that they're considered vile globally and as such, they try to blend in or add codes to identify one another as they realise they cannot be public with their racist and terrible ways. But they're getting smarter with how to use symbols, like the OK-Signal. It was initially a troll from 4chan to get the Media latching onto it. This worked, but 4chan is incredibly stupid. If White Supremacists will use the Symbol, it becomes a White Supremacist Symbol.

Half the UK cabinet has been on record saying they don't want any sort of deal and will actively oppose any sort of attempt to make a deal.

The EU is nowtelling those who need to know what a no-deal scenario means for them, so they can make plans.

Sure it would have been better for everyone if some sort of agreement could be reached where existing certifications for UK entities get grandfathered in or at least remain valid for a transtioning period, while the UK rebuilds their own regulatory institutions and that in the end of the day some sort of mutual recognition between the EU and the UK regulators gets established (mostly with the  UK promising to obey all the EU rules without having a say in it),  that would have been the sane thing to do.

But since the UK is increasingly likely to not be able to negotiate such a transition, this is the obvious result.

For one, here is the following:

[4th millennium BC / Cultures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4th_millennium_BC#Cultures) 

From a broad perspective, it was still the Uruk period in Mesopotamia, which was the precursors to the Sumerians (and the Uruk period was after the Ubaidian period/culture).

Second, we still have to consider the [Indus Valley Civilisation / Harappan Civilisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_Valley_Civilisation) which developed along the Indus river, and more than likely had contact with the Uruk period, if not the Sumerians. I believe the Sumerians and Harappans traded as well, since it was a matter of using the coast to transport goods. There are cuneiform/sumerian tablets/writing they have found in the Indus valley civilization, which shows they had some form of cultural contact.

Third, we still have the [Naqada culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naqada_culture) developing around the Nile river and up to around 3100 BC, which shows at that time the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt by Narmer, so essentially, there was probably some form of trade between Sumeria and Egypt as well. 

Additionally, we still have the Vinca culture as well, in SE Europe.

And I haven't even touched on [Göbekli Tepe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe) which raises even more questions, than answers.

I guess my point here is that there's a bunch of dis-info, or bad information out there that is being pumped by really nasty media that isn't the truth, and very distorted. I've had this argument before, and I could see to an extent how the Giants/Nephilim would come into play, even out of the Bible/Genesis creation story, and now how today's media plays the Annunaki into this myth cycle.

Sumeria wasn't as advanced as today's media likes to prop up, and if anything, they came on the scene about the same time as the other cultures such as Egypt, Indus, early Chinese as well. 

Again, don't take this personally, I just wanted to point out some dates and correct a few things that are getting pushed in today's media which puts WAY to much emphasis on the Ancient Alien/Annunaki stuff.

*The Class Struggle*, there is a De Leon translation, and a more modern Translation. The modern one is closer to the original German.

*The Dictatorship of the Proletariat*

*The social revolution and On the morrow of the social revolution*

Don't mind the seemingly ""hardcore"" titles, Kautsky was quite the softie for his time. It is however NTK for context that Kautsky ""finished"" *Capital*, and as such, one should at least understand the basics of what Marx, Engels, and Kautsky outlines in said work.

* Bernstein:

*The Preconditions of Socialism.*

*Evolutionary Socialism: A Criticism and Affirmation.*

Bernstein was one of the spearheading writers when it comes to what I call Germanic, or Continetal, Social Democracy, as opposed to Anglo Social Democracy. This is because the British Labour movement is a bit different from the continetal Social Democratic movements, and as such we should look at them differently. He is also one of the reasons why it is important to distinguish between Labour- and Social Democratic Parties.

* Bauer

*The World Revolution*

*The Road to Socialism*

*Bolshevism or Social Democracy?*

Especially the last one in this list is important to understand the huge changes in internal commotion that the Bolshevik revolution caused in the International Socialist movement, starting already in Zimmerwald in 1915

* Lassalle 

*The Working Man's Program*

*What is Capital?*

This is primitive-Social Democracy. The absolute basis. While Marx' works greatly shifted the nature of the young Socialist movement, traces of Lassalle still exist up to this day

* Renner

I only brought up Renner because I live in an EU member-state, and his Austro-Marxism which applied to the many nations within the Austro-Hungarian empire can kinda be applied to the modern EU.

*State and Nation*

Sucked at good mining badly but as both were engineers decided to build houses and equipment instead when they ran out of money.

Made a fucking fortune and then went off to try mine gold in South Africa. They both still sucked at mining so build shit again and got even richer.

They then fought in he Boer War, both survived one got mentioned in dispatches etc 

They then tried mining in California and still sucked so built houses and shit again and eventually went to San Francisco in 1909 and used their now considerable house building skills to make more money.


They then went to South America and helped build a load of government buildings that are still around and build sections of the trans Andean railway.


Came home massively rich and loaded with weird and wonderful shit. Got married had kids then went off to the First World War. Both survived and lived happily ever after.

Apart from the whole ridiculous adventures and not realising they sucked at mining my direct relative brought home a load of South American antiques including a jade mask and a load of other shit.

His wife decides it's all evil witchcraft shit and takes it and throws it out.

We have a part inventory of the shit he brought back.

It'd be worth fucking millions today if only we knew where she threw the stuff to get rid of it!!!

As for the rest of the money.....my great grandfather lived like a king, my grandfather blew the rest between 1947 and the 60's.

I can't blame him, by all accounts his WW2 was immensely shit so he basically lived life to the max after the war, taking the ""grand tour"" around Europe ever year or two until the money ran out.

All that's left is a cool story and the nagging thought that somewhere only about 20 miles away from me as I type is a fucking hoard of South American and Africa treasure and antiques that are worth millions.

I forgive my grand father for living it up, after almost dying a few dozen times and not going home for years I can't blame the man.

Okay, so. I'm from EU and this is very well known here - there is a ""hierarchy"", if you will, of nationalities in the workplace. For example, if there's a German company in Germany in the IT industry and the German worker gets paid ~2300 a month then the Polish immigrant will be paid ~1200, Russian will be paid ~900, Somalian will be paid ~600, etc. This is how it works all over the west and its not because of race. Its about being relatively well paid in comparison to previous jobs, etc. The more hopeless and poor the person is the better. This, when applied to entire national economy, drives the wages down to pennies.



Second of all if you import a ridiculous amount of people from the 3rd world then your entire country, culturally and economically, will be transformed into what the new majority used to have in their old countries. There is no magic dirt, there is no transformation. Its just people being who they are.

I wonder if what what's happening is the effects of the change and polarization of high population urban progressives/migrants and the more culturally connected rural populations. That could explain why a nation could rank low on median scores for nationalist sentiment but have a high % score, as this score includes the higher population of urbanites far removed from the cultural connection to their nation and growing populations of migrants that would, for obvious reasons, likely have a greater disposition to not hold nationalist sentiments. However the population of rural people whos culture and nationalist sentiments have been isolated from the social change in urban zones are also included, however they're a lower percentage of total population. That could explain the extremely low median, and (contextually) high percentage score. Goes to show the unfortunate impact of high populations in cities being influenced by the surrounding culture. For the 25% of people who still believe in a national identity, they unfortunately are no longer influential enough to matter.

If it's not what you voted for, can you perhaps point out some official government documentation from before the referendum that outlined Brexit as 'the thing that you *did* vote for'? Was there something that defined the terms of a leave result as meaning 'exactly what you have in mind'? Spurious claims from unaccountable campaign groups are not an official definition.

Because from where I sit, it looks like people voted to leave the EU... without any plan in place about how to do that, what model we'd be seeking, what to expect it to go like, etc.

In elections, parties release manifestos that outline exactly what people are voting for when they vote for those parties. Whether manifesto pledges are carried out or not pretty much defines the success/failure of the resulting government. With Brexit, I have yet to see anything resembling a Brexit manifesto, and as such that option is entirely left undefined. We went for the undefined option, and handed carte blanche to the Conservative party to deliver Brexit in whatever way they saw fit. That is happening, so it can be said that Brexit is a resounding success no matter how fucked we end up from it.

* Secure departure from the EU ✅

* Invoke article 50 ✅

* Negotiate with EU officials ✅

* Leave EU - In progress

This total lack of an official definition is *exactly why* there was all that fuss about hard Brexit, soft Brexit, red white and blue Brexit, full English Brexit, continental Brexit... etc immediately after the referendum. Theresa May helpfully quelled all that with ""Brexit means Brexit"". This total lack of an official definition is *exactly why* no two leave voters have an identical vision of Brexit. This total lack of an official definition is *exactly why* the likes of BoJo and Gove are swanning around the place touting their own version and getting away with being all high and mighty at May... their versions are more popular (and less realistic)... and she can't correct them by pointing to 'what Brexit means' and what the public voted for. It's also exactly why Theresa May can't get her shit together and make any meaningful progress.

The shitshow is a direct result of nobody having a clue what Brexit even means. I'm not talking about 'Brexiteers are stupid and ignorant hurr hurrr', I'm talking about there being no meaning attached to the word in the first place. So yeah... if you knew what Brexit meant when you voted, then you're either God or you're from the future. The definition has not been put in place, and therefore the word is going to remain undefined until the end results of it pan out.

Cameron's government lies at fault for this. They called the referendum without first working on a plan to put to the people as one of the options in the referendum.

According to the polling, the biggest single issue for voting leave was “the principle that decisions about the UK should be taken in the UK”, 33% of leave voters felt that leaving “offered the best chance for the UK to regain control over immigration and its own borders.”' and so voted leave. It was important, it wasn't the only issue though, and it probably wasn't the most important. And again, we have had a long period where leave would likely have won a referendum on EU membership, including well before freedom of movement became a vocal issue.

From a characterization perspective, I think Elio being an only child is intentional. Samuel and Annella clearly adore him, but it's also clear that they very much have their own lives and *lifestyle*, which they enjoy, and it's perhaps not all that conducive to the presence of multiple children. Elio seems to be expected to fit himself into those lives - unlike modern helicopter parents, they don't seem to live their lives around *him*. Maybe they also just liked the dynamic of a trio - they got whatever they hoped to get from parenthood by just having Elio, and were content with that choice.

As an aside - I seem to recall a fan from either a European or Asian country reporting that in their translation of the novel, Elio actually has an older brother, whose absence is never elaborated upon, he is simply 'away'. Has anybody else seen that information discussed? It makes me wonder if that country actually released a (perhaps earlier) differently-edited draft of the book, and the passage was deleted in other editions.

The issue is over any special agreements we might arrange with the EU as part of that decision to leave.   The EU is a powerful trading partner and our economies are intertwined so it would be highly desirable to form such an agreement, and highly costly not to.  The thing about an agreement is... both sides have to agree.  It's precisely because EU is a union of sovereign nations that we can't force them to agree to anything, and they can't force us to agree to anything.

a) constituted a loss of sovereignty 

b) was something unique to our membership of the EU and would somehow not apply out of it.

This was obviously deceptive and silly.  All agreements with other countries require compromise and in many cases, external systems of arbitration. 

What article 50 puts in place is a framework for coming to an agreement.

I had a “normal”/slim figure up until 5 years ago when I got on the antidepressant Saroten and gained 35 kg (77 lbs) in less than six months. After the weight gain I changed my meds, but I hated my body and was still heavily depressed so over the past 4 years I slowly gained an additional 10 kg (22 lbs) due to an unhealthy diet.

Now I finally feel better - depression wise - and in March 2018 I started counting calories (without weighing myself). Finally towards the end of april i started to track my weight and since then (in 9 weeks) I’ve lost 7,5 kg (16.5 lbs), started going to power yoga classes 2-3 times a week and I’ve started to eat much healthier. 
I also have a dog that I walk for almost 3 hours a day - I guess that counts as exercise too! And I bike to and from my job.

My goal for this challenge is to try be more patient (I’ve noticed that I’m extremely impatient about my weight loss), keep counting calories, lose about 10 lbs and keep up my yoga.

This summer I’m going to be a camp counsellor and afterwards I’m starting an internship so I know it’s gonna be a struggle to keep counting calories because at camp I’m not going to be preparing my own food and when I get back my everyday schedule is going to be quite different than what I’m used to.",True,False,False,,0,1530439813,,False,0,e1lgynn,False,t3_8uu1gd,True,t3_8uu1gd,/r/team_2ndbreakfast/comments/8uu1gd/welcome_and_introductions/e1lgynn/,,1535542776,2,False,True,False,team_2ndbreakfast,t5_km0ja,r/team_2ndbreakfast,public,

A questão aqui é que não se usa o pronome reflexivo nessa construção de verbo estar + particípio, mesmo que o verbo seja reflexivo. Por exemplo:

*Ele se sentou* —&gt; *Ele está sentado* (e não *Ele está se sentado*)

*Ele se machucou* —&gt; *Ele está machucado* (e não *Ele está se machucado*)

**Experience:** I've been playing WoW on and off for years, but only got into raiding in Legion/7.3.5 after having been gone from the game for a few months. So far, I've been playing 'on my own' in LFR and am really motivated to get into higher levels of play while keeping the focus on having fun while doing so. I'm still pretty new to this aspect of the game though.

**What I'm bringing to the table:** I am currently maining a DH (mostly Havoc) and have some experience on Rogue (mostly Outlaw), but have a 110-toon for almost all of the classes and wouldn't mind switching to a different main if needed (DPS and/or Healing). I consider myself a quick learner and am definitely willing to accept guidance from more experienced players. Switching factions/realms is not an issue for me, also wouldn't mind boosting a new character, if necessary. Toxic behaviour is something you won't be seeing from me.

**What I'm looking for in a guild:** Mostly just a friendly, fun environment that's accepting of people still learning the game and doesn't tolerate toxic behaviour. I am also not looking for hardcore raiding, but rather casual progression. First and foremost, I play WoW to have fun and would love a guild that keeps the focus on that while still taking things fairly serious. I'm not interested in PvP-stuff. (Bonus points if it's a German-speaking guild, but that's not a must.)

**Schedule:** Two raid nights during week days would be perfect for me. (I'm a freelancer that's mostly working on weekends.) Occasionally, I could probably do one more. But don't quote me on that. ;)

There's a TL;DR at the bottom to sum this up shorter if you find this too long of a read.

From what we have in game, we are outright told that Ashfeld itself is monotheistic. Apollyon, for all her warmongering, is an incredibly reliable narrator when it comes to the cultures of the three factions. After all, it was her in depth understanding of those cultures that allowed her to figure out how to enact her plans. From all the symbols the knights have for outfits - including outright crusader crosses - as well as the architecture with angels and such, we made the logical conclusion. The knights were something akin to Christianity even if they were not actually Christian of any denomination we would define. And honestly, I don't think we ever expected an outright answer.

""But what of Apollyon saying the gods of the knights are of metal and gold""? So, is Odin literally made of wood and spirit then? That was a metaphorical observable, about what each faction associates with the divine - vastly different ideas, but they all agree on power. Could that mean a degree of polytheism? Sure, I don't think anyone said it was impossible, and this is a topic where nuance rules out over absolutes. And that was what made Roman's answer so problematic - he made it absolute, when he should have said something like 'the knights are not united under one specific faith'. The way he put it, with all the Greco-Roman stuff, made it sound like the knights were supposed to be worshipping the Greek gods under their Roman names. IE, it came off that he was saying my Warden should be praying to Minerva before bed or my Lawbringer invoking Jupiter (AKA Zeus) for authority when condemning a rapist to be hanged.

Now I have never opposed the Greco-Roman stuff simply because it is Greco-Roman. That culture had always been a topic of fascination by medieval scholars and Rome was often invoked as from where legitimacy stemmed from - the Holy Roman Empire, while perhaps never any of the three, was meant to be a continuation of the legacy of the Western Roman Empire if only in spirit. My issue had always been that there was over five hundred years of culture being glossed over in the process. It was getting Greco-Roman time and again in every release that wore us down to the point where this tweet set off a firestorm, because the knights were beginning to feel like our concept was being heavily diluted away from the pitch that got us onboard, especially since both our DLC heroes were Romans. Yes, I am aware the Vikings got a Gael and a Pict, but the Highlander was explicitly a foreign ally and the Shaman was only revealed to actually be a Pict and another foreign battle thrall months after her release, until then she had us all fooled since she so neatly fit into the Warborn roster conceptually. The Gladiator, by contrast, is just at odds with the rest of the faction's aesthetic.

Now, my personal headcanon is that the knights as a whole were Christian - a blend of them but taking more from Orthodox Christianity as I always felt that, thematically speaking, it fit them because it lacks any specific single religious authority because it is split between several Patriarchs. Yet I knew it was a headcanon; for all I knew the knights were meant to be Cathars, which is still a historical branch of Christianity if an obscure one (also an interesting read if you want to look them up). And of course the Centurion and Gladiator were probably Roman Polytheistic; but I didn't mind that as long as it was understood that they were foreign allies the same as the Highlander and Pict, not representative of the actual knights themselves. Okay sure, maybe Gladiators are more widespread in various arenas fighting to entertain the masses and kept to it, but it didn't have to be a large segment of the population.

Even then, I always felt the Deus Vult meme was overused. Hell, when writing *Honor's Trial* I headcannoned up a whole legion meant to *mock* that meme and the fact we kept getting our shit kicked in early on. But hey, it was fun and the Crusades are one of the most iconic time periods that knights existed in, even if they failed utterly after the First Crusade.

Now, if Ubisoft really just did not want to touch a religion that is currently a large segment of the world because ultimately it wasn't a major facet of *For Honor*? Then Roman should have just given a vague answer that the knights were not unified under any single doctrine, or point to the observable Apollyon had made. It would have left it vague, but it would not have been such a slap in the face and could have been taken as a graceful non-answer. I don't think anyone ever truly expected the devs to come out and say ""Yes, the knights are meant to be Roman Catholic Christians"" or anything like that, but we didn't expect such a clumsy retcon either.

I mean, if the Warborn can scream about Odin and Valhalla while the Orochi can beseech her ancestors for strength while fighting Apollyon, why can't the knights be left with the implication they were monotheistic from the observables and general aesthetic? I mean even then for all the DV memes the knights in-game always seemed to be more grounded and worldly rather than pious. Just say that the knights do not feel the zeal to shove it down everyone's throats by book or sword and don't scream about it, and leave it at that.

So, for me I feel the issue is not that the knights are not exclusively monotheistic - Apollyon's observable spoke about Ashfeld, and we know there are plenty of lands beyond Ashfeld that the knights inhabit. The issue was that after everything, it felt like a clumsy retcon that instead the knights were meant to be Roman Polytheistic rather than just having some Jupiter-worshiping allies fighting alongside them. But I refuse to ascribe malicious intent to Roman about this. I think he meant to give a quick answer that was true (since if the Cent has kept to those ancient gods and he is part of the Legion roster, that does make it true on the technical point), but unfortunately it was taken as an absolute answer about the entire faction when it was meant to have a degree of nuance.

And coming on the heels of ""Chinese and Japanese are different"" - which, I should specify, is also absolutely true even if they could have had a Chinese hero in the Chosen roster if they only made one, as long as they specified it was a foreign ally - it seemed like a huge slap in the face to the knights who joined for the Medieval European Knights. It came off as Classical Age Europe = Medieval Europe and a massive double standard. And from that, we got pissed off because of building tension and worry from seeing so little knightly stuff added to our collection was finally hit with a spark.

Anyways, for those who felt the above is a case of Too Long; Didn't Read:

* In game we are told Ashfeld is monotheistic, and so that colored the perception of what the knights were even if there are more lands beyond Ashfeld. It felt like it was implied but not outright stated because Ubisoft didn't want to touch it since it was more of a piece of fluff to the game than a key focus. Easier to just let it be implied by that and the faction's aesthetic and architecture, right?
* The Greco-Roman outfits and items and the Roman heroes, while not innately wrong, made it increasingly feel like the knights were being taken off concept by a sudden interest in Classical Age Europe, without enough spacing to make it seem like it was just an extra spark rather than bastardizing the faction.
* The Wu Lin being separate, even if it was just a matter of number of hero concepts that sparked it, made this bad taste even worse as the differences were specifically called out.
* Roman's answer to the question of the knight's religion was too blunt and absolute, making it appear thanks to the above that he was clumsily retconning the knights to Greek Polytheistic under the names Rome had for them.
* Even though it was not meant maliciously, the apparently absolute answer set off a the building tension from all the above. If he intended nuance of 'the knights are not unified under a specific faith', he completely lost it by making a one-word answer.

Yes.. it's a conversation after all.

&gt;Re read again . It's you who have agenda here some how justifying you lack of political power to deal with EU.

I want to see the UK outside of the EU, but I'd also prefer it if people who discuss the issue do so while looking at the reality of the situation, not some mistaken understanding. The common ones are that the UK doesn't manufacture, or that it is a small economy, or that it is somehow militarily dependent on the EU..

&gt;If you cannot deal with EU being part of it and having many concessions you get from EU . UK is failure .

Why? How does not wanting to be in the EU a failure? Moreover, the UK as an EU member is one of 27, it can't force the other members to do things, or to move in a given direction, and it'd be a bit of a problem if it could do that against the wishes of the others. That's not a failure either, but it's a good reason to leave the EU.

&gt;How is Germany and France being inside EU still have larger global footprint. It's your fault to blame others when you are the one who is milking EU with special demands

Germany has a larger economy than the UK, militarily it is weaker than both France and the UK, in terms of international soft power, it's also fairly weak (although it has a lot of regional power, via the EU, not without limits of course). France and the UK are fairly similar, the UK has a marginally larger economy, but both have similar military capabilities (the UK again slightly ahead now with it's recent modernisation, but France isn't far behind), moreover, the UK and France work together on defence, outside of the EU.

But France and Germany also both see more benefits from EU membership than the UK does, and both France and Germany seem happier with a more integrated and centralised EU. The UK doesn't.  

Oh, and the UK isn't 'milding' the EU either. Germany has a rebate via VAT, and France is over-represented in terms of CAP payments (which is why the UK, Germany and others have adjustments to how much they end up passing to the EU in various ways).",True,False,False,,0,1530450832,,False,0,e1lmirn,False,t3_8uudwq,True,t1_e1lm6kp,/r/geopolitics/comments/8uudwq/brexit_last_call_for_deal_donald_tusk_warns_uk/e1lmirn/,,1535545397,1,False,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,

It's a good question and hard to answer. There was certainly broader cultural awareness of them before, and things like civil defense did play a role in that. I suspect (but it hard to know) that nuclear issues did come up more in courses during the Cold War than they do today.

Nuclear issues could be easily integrated into courses on history, political science, or science, if one wanted to do so. I'm a historian, so I think history is the natural fit for it, but I'd take what I could get. Personally I think an easy thing to argue for is more attention given to Cold War history in general — along with the nuclear topic, it sets up _many_ important concerns that resonate through the present day, and if you don't know the history of them, it's hard to have an informed opinion on the world. (Russia, espionage, Eastern Europe, People's Republic of China, North Korea/Korean War, nuclear weapons, Civil Rights Movement, decolonization, Soviet-Afghan War, proxy wars, Iranian Revolution, etc. etc.) In US history courses (so I think as an American historian), high school courses spend WAY too much time on the early stuff and frequently never get to the history whose role in shaping the present world is very direct.

No, it was just economically smashed, lost it's empire, lost its technological edge to the US, and obviously had lots of dead.

&gt;Unlike most other participants, it wasn't even invaded, and I think that's what they were getting at.

I don't think the UK is going to be invaded upon leaving the EU either though are we?

&gt;I definitely agree that there's a certain hubris to many natives, but I put that down to carryover from the fact that Britain was the last to have a properly vast, colonial Empire. The biggest in history, in fact.

I'm not sure what hubris is on display here though, the UK is looking to leave the EU, it's not invading France, there is the potential for a negative outcome, but it is not on a scale comparable to a world war.  Moreover, the UK has had to go through major economic disruptions several times, so this isn't even novel in that sense.

&gt;I have no problem with being proud about heritage, but when you're advocating for no deal unless you get your way, I worry about how much of a grasp a lot of people have concerning the economic implications of such a strategy.

Surely if the UK is advocating for a no-deal unless it gets its way, then the EU is too? The point is that the UK and EU need to find a deal they can agree to, that works for both.  The UK accepting a bad deal for the sake of it isn't somehow egotistical, it makes sense if there is no good deal on the table. And lets be clear, most people want a deal, just not at any cost.

The inspection can pay dividends in negotiations in my experience, especially if a mechanic is chosen the neither you nor the seller has a prior relationship with. For example, what I usually do is tell the seller that we'll set a number, say $300. This is after negotiating a price BTW. Anyway, I would agree with the seller that if it's any repair under $300, I won't renegotiate, but if it is, I'll attempt to reduce the price by the amount of the repair, if I'm even still interested at that point. Other benefits are if the seller balks at a pro inspection, that's a red flag. Also having bad news come from a respected mechanic eliminates the doubt for the seller that you could be scamming him buy coming up with some BS issue to drive the price down. Finally with an older European luxury car, repairs are going to be a bit pricier than a 96 Corolla, as I'm sure you already know, lol. So an abundance of caution is warranted. 

Also as a caveat I'm not a professional in anything related to cars, I've just bought and sold (and crashed) about 25 cars and have learned some things along the way. 

By the way another good trick is to bring a big piece of cardboard, throw it under the car after the test drive and leave it there while you talk with the seller, then pull it and see what's leaking.

This is a really dumb hill to plant your flag on. That was *this event* I've seen M rated runs in the afternoon Pacific Time before. More importantly, it's a 24 hour charity stream with a multinational audience. So what about the European children watching the event at their normal time?

&gt;The purpose of this event is to make money for charity

This is the only accurate statement in this paragraph.

&gt;show off the speedrun community in a positive light. 

Except it's not an accurate representation since clearly even mild humor is being met with fear tactics. It's had a chilling effect on the way people behave on the GDQ stream. Also, this is kind of superfluous given that each of those streamers is going home the following week and is going to adhere primarily to their personal preferences. So you aren't really portraying anything about the speed running community except maybe giving the people the wrong idea.

&gt;Having your runners make edgy jokes, or having them say nigger for donation money hampers your ability to grow as a mature organization.

The only reason you would need the organization to grow is if there was a financial incentive to do so. Nobody who raises money for charity is *EVER* disappointed when a goal isn't met. Usually people are just happy with what they can do. Considering GDQs roots are in someone's spare bedroom with 12ish chairs it's come a long way. Point being that it didn't need to continue to grow bigger, that was a deliberate decision.



&gt;Yeah maybe they make money for the massive amount of time and effort these things require.

My gripe isn't that they make money or that it doesn't require time or effort. My gripe is that it generates a *disproportionate* amount of money for the time and effort that goes into it. How many opprotunities have you had to pocket at minimum 50k for MAYBE 6 months of part time work (I really don't think event planning is that complicated.) In fact it's SO uncomplicated they can organize events AND work a day job twice a year no less.

&gt;Why is that so offensive to you?

Because it's disingenuous to present yourself as a non profit organization when you are a FOR profit organization representing a non profit organization.

&gt;Its like you pretend this is a zero effort affair to administrate, advertise for, get sponsors for, get people willing to throw their time and money at producing. If the people that administer this make some money for doing it, great, MSF or PCF gets over 2 million in donations for it.

If it's a non-profit effort, there should be volunteers involved. But setting that aside it's a common criticism of non profits anyway. People like to see that Non profits carry lean operating procedures. But If Mike Uyama saw 10% of the money raised last week, he's getting cut a check for $210,000. Even post tax he's going to see ~$150k of that and if he sinks $100k back into GDQ HE STILL made 50k in a single week. That's not lean by any means. Everyone involved in profiting from GDQ is making out like a bandit relatively speaking. 


&gt;If theres a community need/drive for another speedrunning event where you can go do all the shit you don't, or can't do at GDQs, it will pop up.

The current hurdle is legitimizing speedrunning. The big speedrunning events work explicitly because it's charity.

&gt;Or it won't, and all the people upset here about how GDQ isn't what they want will be here uselessly flailing instead of making their own speedrunning event with tacitly endorsed harassment and racism.

Yup. Typical ""Only racists and harassment enthusiasts can be dissatisfied with GDQ"" Strawman. Keep sucking that corporate dick.

Siege 2 isn't going to happen for the same reasons Overwatch 2, League of Legends 2, or Fortnite 2 won't happen. There's no real reason to go through the effort of making ""brand new games"" for them when they can change things as they go along. If Ubisoft truly feels they need to dedicate more time to their tech debt, they'll do an Operation Health 2 or end Rainbow Six development entirely. But unless they have a revolutionary idea for a Rainbow Six title, they won't invest in building a new game from scratch.

As for the engine, people woefully underestimate how much developers can change. The **AnvilNext 2.o**, terrible name, also powers Steep, For Honor, and Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands. It's used because it is incredibly versatile, and it's what the developers know and can work the best on. Changing engines would just add a new learning curve to an already difficult process.

Everything in programming references something else. It's an ever growing mangled mass of roots and branches where one small change in a seemingly unrelated area can ruin hours of work you did elsewhere. I'm inclined to think that no engine can solve this problem, only people. Frostbite and CryEngine are excellent for example, but have hundreds have extremely capable and passionate people dedicating all of their professional and personal time into making them run like butter.

That's not what Siege has at its disposal.

They're a content first team left behind to grow an existing product. That's why big graphical changes or the recoil/sight alignment changes take so long. Small teams doing their best while splitting with other responsibilities.

I'm a bit confused by this statement?

You vote for your local MP, who helps determine which party has majority seats. The party then internally choses a primeminister behind closed doors. That primeminster then chooses a representative. These are the people who create legislation.

Outside of that there are elections for EU members held at different times. These are completely separate from the leading party and are the people who amend, accept or deny legislation. And the people who vote on a president.

Le fait est que pour le moins polluer, le mieux vivre, il faut se réunir en haute densité. L'urbanisation a une raison, et l'étalement des cultures fait partie des maux qui fait mal à notre planète. De fait, si les humains se réunissaient dans des zones urbaines ultra-centralisées, citons l'exemple des arcologies qui sont la version optimale de ces zones, et faisaient des cultures très denses sur plusieurs étages autour, il serait possible de garder une nature bien plus imposante. Il ne faut pas oublier que l'Europe de l'Ouest est couverte de fermes et de forêts artificielles, et elle ne ressemble plus du tout à son état sauvage ou semi-sauvage de jadis. Pour qu'il y ait développement de nos sociétés et préservation de la nature, ça exige de tout changer. Et pas que dans les pays en voie de développement, mais aussi bien chez nous. 

Nous avons besoin des arbres pour la survie de l'écosystème et de nos planètes, et commencer à les replanter dans les pays qui ont le pouvoir et les moyens de le faire, serait déjà un grand pas en avant.

De fait, il faut recréer le lien humain-nature, mais en premier, il faut le recréer chez nous. Il est trop facile de juger des peuples pour ce que nous avons fait il y a un ou plusieurs siècles. Si on montrait l'exemple, on serait plus honnêtes, et on aurait là un vrai impact sur le monde.

Since Vatican II (the formally titled ""the 2nd Ecumenical Council of the Vatican,"" by Catholic reconing the 21st ecumenical council) the nature and work of women's &amp; men's religious communities have changed enormously. Coupled with ongoing social and economic changes in the 20th Century, the of people leading a vowed life in stable communities have dropped by 60&amp;#37; since a peak in the 50s, between the end of World War II and the Vatican II in the early to mid 60's. Simply put, women have more choices and rightfully so.

For example, see [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7227629.stm](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7227629.stm) and [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/vaticancityandholysee/10103961/Number-of-priests-and-nuns-in-marked-decline.html](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/vaticancityandholysee/10103961/Number-of-priests-and-nuns-in-marked-decline.html)

Religious life remains an option and, more properly, a calling for those few people truly called to it.

There is a crisis in some communities about how to care for aging members when there are so few young adults entering into religious life and staying in it.

The story telling version of religious life shows a fascination with this way of life without understanding it. There are not tens of thousands of fertile, young women available to be turned into Handmaids for the Commanders. Try a couple thousand nation-wide, tops.

As for the idea there are tens of thousands of nuns (who are monastics) and sisters (vowed religious but not monastic) available to labor in the Colonies, the only labor you're going to get out of those women is parking their walkers and wheel chairs. Those who aren't sick are in their 60s &amp; 70s, trying to bring in enough money for elderly nuns and sisters in assisted living &amp; nursing facilities.

I'm 32. I've been an Independent for most of my voting life.

I'd be all for a Democratic Socialist movement - and I make plenty of money now, and would like to spread some of that money to my peers through those socialistic benefits. I benefited greatly when I was growing up by my public library, by public roads, and by public education and community colleges. My experience with socialism so far has been nothing but positive.

My experience with Capitalism, meanwhile, has taught me several lessons. First among them was how Capitalism served me in my health. A doctor prescribed me broad-spectrum high-strength antibiotics and failed to tell me to take probiotics at the same time, resulting in my gut bacteria being near-completely wiped out - and allowing the bad bacteria to flourish. After a few hour stay in a hospital for extreme abdominal pain months later (which had been steadily getting slightly worse, but which I refused to go to the doctor to because money was tight) and nausea after seeking aid at a less expensive CareNow before being immediately recommended by them to a nearby hospital's ER where my pain, sweat, and nausea passed over several hours with IV fluids, but for which they could do nothing on my underlying condition but shrug their shoulders and say 'good luck', I was awarded with a bill that nearly bankrupted us.

You will get sick. You will be bankrupted like me. You don't have to be bankrupted - this cost could be distributed across society rather than placed squarely on your shoulders while insurance companies ensure that the prices remain sky-high for relatively little treatment. The same thing I went through, if I had lived in a country in Europe which provided access for socialized medicine, would've resulted in my paying perhaps $100 for all that instead of $14,500 for some doctors to tell me my life is in danger, shrug their shoulders, and then kick me out the doors. I also could've avoided having all sorts of health problems that resulted from my not going in to a doctor for fear it would bankrupt me to only be bankrupted later.

If I had lived in Europe, I would've been better off. I would be going to regular medical checkups, I wouldn't be paranoid about going to see doctors, and I wouldn't have to gamble with my health to *try* and keep myself capable of actually retiring when I get older.",True,False,False,,0,1530472158,,1530472426,0,e1m7911,False,t3_8v2nxi,True,t1_e1kef9c,/r/politics/comments/8v2nxi/the_millennial_socialists_are_coming/e1m7911/,,1535555053,1,False,True,False,politics,t5_2cneq,r/politics,public,

But Salvini's objective is now another: ""To transform ourselves also into a European force, into an international force, which goes beyond regional and national borders and brings freedom, work and security to all the peoples of Europe"".

I grew up in Brooklyn, my friends and I were nearly all the grandchildren of immigrants from Europe. While there were a couple that could speak another language to one degree or another, we were all native English speakers, schools didn't teach in anything other than English then.

Your neighbors were all Americans, you might have Greek or Italian neighborhoods, but these children of immigrants were living right next door for the most part.

So the Father, being an avatar of balance, is still light.

That was his old comment before he was part of the writing team of ghost of mortis. Lucas is someone who is well known to change his mind on his stories (which can be seen in the OT movies) so him changing his mind on the force is something that is kinda shown in that arc. Especially with how the dark and the light side is controlled by the balance, the father. He was the perfect force user to me in this new version of ""balance"" that lucas probably picked up on with all the other EU media that portrayed it as such. I mean the force unleashed was canon to him before the purge and you have Galen Marek using both the light and dark side as well. 


&gt;As Luke explains in TLJ, the Force is part of (or between) nature, which contains both life and death. Yoda considers death a natural part of life, and dying is ""the way of the Force"". For a Jedi, it means transcendence. Besides, plenty of Jedi bring death; what's the difference between Bendu bringing down ships with a storm or Luke killing millions aboard the Death Star?

Exactly, that is the **JEDI** school of though, they're not all knowing which is hammered over and over again in the new canon and old. Jedi only bring death when they need to, never to kill millions in an act and the jedi of the old republic were wrong to join the fight. That is why there are whole arcs about the jedi turning from peace keepers into warriors for the republic and questioning their order. Also Luke wasn't a jedi when he blew up the death star. 

Also the difference is that the bendu is using the force to attack and not enhance his senses. He is bending the force to his will to create a storm and in anger strike down the empire. If that isn't dark side then the dark side isn't the dark side anymore. 

&gt;Or you have a different understanding of the Force than what's presented in the film. TLJ lays its interpretation out pretty clearly, and to me it chimes with Lucas's ideas pretty well.

No, I have a complete understanding of the force and the only thing that was represented well was Rey drowning in the black sea which was the dark side. That was well established before the movies to be true. The force ghost and Yoda bending the will of the force to attack the tree goes directly against what Yoda said before ""We never use the force to attack, only defend"". It was like RJ saw some cool center force user shit and put it on Yoda which I can see him doing since he is well known to make things up just because they are cool and not because they make sense with the rest of the movie. 

So from that I'm just guessing, which seems to be the logical point to make with the rest of the media, is that Yoda became one with the force and finally figured out the dark and light side are two sides of the same coin. 



BUT despite all this, the fact remains that there were, and probably still are, two force users in the galaxy that use both sides of the force in canon.

Am lucrat in constructii 3-4 ani + si aproape fiecare vara de cand aveam 17 ani. Am lucrat la olimpiada din Londra, case de lux(5m+), proiecte ale guvernului si cam orice altceva iti trece prin cap.

O chestie generala e ca atunci cand il intrebi pe un roman nou venit ce stie sa faca, el iti zice ca stie sa faca orice, pune centrale, trage gaz, e electrician, face mobila, pune asfalt, construieste acoperisuri, lucreaza cu plumb/cupru/aur/vibranium si adamantiu si in general s-a nascut facand asta si pentru a face asta. Si cand ii dai un cui si un ciocan, se apuca sa bata cuiul peste ciocan. In orice companie serioasa cand vine unul si zice ""eu stiu sa fac aproape orice"" de obicei e pus sa fie salahor si sa faca ordine pe unde se lucreaza si sa care ce trebuie carat. 

Proiectele mici de casa nu prea se fac asa des cu contract, poate doar daca e ceva mai serios gen o extensie/modificari structurale/lucrat cu gaz/etc, 90% din echipe au asigurare in caz ca fac o prostie si acolo un contract verbal e o chestie destul de serioasa si nu e greu sa-i futi in caz de fac vreo prostie. Diferenta e in pret. Acolo un instalator vine cu o duba de scule si are si vreo 15-30.000 bagati in cursuri si ia 250 lire pe zi de munca, la noi vine cu o sacosa cu o cheie si o banda de teflon, dar e ieftin. La noi iti monteaza o centrala cu cateva sute de lei, acolo doar semnatura pentru inspectia centralei si circuitului e un minim de 500 de lire. 

Sunt si companii de romani care lucreaza cu prostii si fac prostii, dar astia ii iei doar daca esti prost si ieftin, altfel lumea lucreaza profi pentru ca pentru companiile mici majoritatea lucrarilor vin de la oameni care au vazut ce-ai lucrat is au prieteni la care ai lucrat. Deci reputatia e foarte, foarte importanta. 

La noi e free for all, instalatorul meu stia sa faca de toate, dar au trecut 3 saptamani si-as vrea sa-l chem inapoi sa-l intreb de ce e o teava uda, dar surpriza, e disparut(chiar daca a luat doar jumatate din bani). Am avut unul sa imi indrepte peretii prin casa si a lucrat o saptamana de la 8 dimineata la 8 seara intr-un hol si o camera mica si a cerut 2000 de lei, i-am dat 400 si i-am zis ca ii ia pe aia sau nu primeste nimic si imi plateste si materialele pentru ca si-a batut joc de timpul meu si a facut mizerie degeaba.

As an American who lived in Europe for a short amount of time (around 4 months, so enough to get a feel), some of the points brought up were fair, but were not totally accurate or out of proportion. One thing to note is that each state is different, because states have a fair amount of self-governance. And, even then, it depends on the individual. 

For the work and healthcare related issues, it’s true we don’t have those thing ensured by the government, but individuals try and bargain for better benefits, such as more vacation days, maternity/paternity leave, better health benefits, et cetera, even without unions. Although, some people can’t bargain for those things, partially because they aren’t in unions.

The gun laws are a state-by-state and place-to-place thing. Some states have strict laws, some don’t. Although shootings do happen, they are definitely not as rampant as the thread mentioned.

Politics is definitely blown out of proportion. Yes, we have a president that Europeans, and a majority of Americans, do not like. We also do have to figure out some stuff politically. But, we do have federal elections every 2 years, and we don’t have parties that are explicitly neo-nazis in office.

*Speaking exclusively to Jacob Rees-Mogg, Comment Central’s Bruce Newsome talks May, Brexit, the soul, and a potential leadership.*

Jacob Rees-Mogg is one of only a few politicians who can walk on stage during a heat wave, wearing a buttoned dark double-breasted suit, to speak for an hour in a marquee warmed by hundreds of guests, and not break a sweat. His good humour, quick wit, sharp reposts, self-deprecation, and soothing manners never falter.

Yet, despite self-possession and mindfulness, even in my private interview Jacob Rees-Mogg is open and honest about his leader (Theresa May), the future of the Conservative Party, and Brexit.

Inevitably, since he was speaking at the Chalke Valley History Festival, he was introduced flippantly as a representative from the Eighteenth Century, although he replied that he preferred the Seventeenth Century, given the “growth of parliamentary democracy” then. At times reminiscent of religious faith, his consideration of British parliamentary democracy anchors almost everything he said. This is most obvious in his views on Brexit, which he characterized as the most important constitutional change since the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and certainly a more important change than the vote to join the European Community in 1975, because now we are leaving a European Union with “fingers in every pie”.

He welcomes Brexit for “reinforcing democracy” and “reclaiming civil law.” He asserts “a fundamental difference” between the English-tradition of “common law” (derived from judicial decisions) and the continent’s grounding in Roman, or “Napoleonic law”. Everybody in the realm, even the monarch, is subject to common law, but the continental tradition is comfortable with several steps of separation between rulers and both judicial and democratic accountability. For Rees-Mogg, the British tradition is “incompatible” with the European Union.

He admits that he worries about being wrong in general, but not on the principle of “voting against European governance” of Britain. “We’re better at it ourselves.” He delivered this conclusion with rare exclamation, which earned the second loudest round of applause of the event.

The loudest applause was earned in answer to a question about how he could look young people in the face given that they will live with more of the consequences of leaving the EU. Rees-Mogg replied that he believed that young people will value the right to vote directly for all their policymakers: “You can’t vote out the European bureaucracy.” Incidentally, that questioner started off by saying that he was “much more likeable” than she had expected, which drew the loudest laughter of the evening.

The only issue that would have persuaded him to vote Remain in 2016 would have been a significant risk to the union with Scotland; subsequently, Brexit has strengthened the union. The union with Northern Ireland remains just as strong and the border can be resolved more easily than the fashionable discourse pretends.

Everything since the referendum has confirmed his confidence in Brexit, including the EU’s intransigence and the performance of Britain’s economy against most forecasts. “The EU is the risk to our competitiveness” because it piles on regulations that are focused on controlling competition within the EU instead of promoting competitiveness with the rest of the world. He prefers a “free market” to a “protectionist European Union.”

More reports are confirming that May is telling her Cabinet to unite around a “soft Brexit,” but that would be unacceptable to Rees-Mogg. When I asked him to clarify what sort of Brexit he would find unacceptable, he said that he would oppose any commitment to pay £39 billion without a specified trade deal. But surely, I replied, that is what May had already agreed in December 2017. This was the only time I saw Rees-Mogg rattled all day. He evaded the link.

Is he a populist? Yes, he said, if you mean he is offering people what is best for them. Politicians gain votes by promising people what they want – often this means promising what can’t be delivered (such as more spending on everything) or what politicians have no intention of delivering. Populism is a rebellion against choices that are best for the elite. “The people make the choice, politicians offer the choice.”  “I was born into the establishment; that’s how I know how rotten it is” – at least since it was taken over by “the liberal metropolitan elite.” During debates over the government’s EU Withdrawal Bill, “the condescension in the House of Lords was absolutely extraordinary”. If they had better understood the outside world, they would have predicted Brexit.

￼
 
Without prompting, Rees-Mogg reversed the elitist blame of the voter for the decline in voter turnout. He blamed it on the elite offering poor choices. Since turnout declined in the general elections of 1997 and 2001, implicitly the ultimate blame attaches to Tony Blair, who won those elections, but also John Major as Conservative Party leader in 1997, and his successor William Hague through the general election of 2001. The blame might extend to the subsequent leaders Iain Duncan Smith and Michael Howard, who led the party without a return to government.

What is his view of the party’s leadership into the future? Coincidentally, today Conservative Home’s editor reported a new survey of members and suggested “a sense that change is coming sooner rather than later – that Theresa May might not be prime minister by this time next year, or even earlier, and that the time has come to think more probingly about a replacement.” Rees-Mogg had either topped the monthly poll, or come second to “other,” since the general election in 2017, although now Rees-Mogg is fourth, behind Sajid Javid (the Home Secretary), Michael Gove (the Environment Secretary), and “other”.

Rees-Mogg said that May “is doing very well considering the shocking majority” she earned at the 2017 election. This was a clever way of blaming May while formally empathizing. He went further with a back-handed compliment. He asked the audience to think of the party conference in October 2017, when “she was losing her voice and the stage was collapsing,” but she carried on. He said that the scene reminded him of the film “Carry on up the Khyber” (1968), when Sid James portrayed an officer unphased in his personal ablutions during enemy attacks. Rees-Mogg ground out the analogy with untypical relish, then he concluded calmly that he valued the principle of “doing your duty, and I think duty is the word that best describes Mrs. May.”

Rees-Mogg says that he supports May as leader, but clearly this is partisan not personal. “The Tory Party gets itself in trouble whenever it conspires against its leader,” although “that doesn’t mean you should agree with every policy.” He said that she may not be your choice of leader, but “she is the leader of the party, and loyalty is the Conservative Party’s secret weapon.”

I asked him to clarify an apparent contradiction: he praises parliamentary democracy for the voter’s capacity to directly elect and deselect representatives, while he was denying himself his capacity as a Member of Parliament to deselect his party leader. He clarified that he was retaining the “right” as a Member of Parliament, but his “choice” is to support his party leader.

Yet, Rees-Mogg has no hesitation in discussing who should replace Theresa May.

He said that since Stanley Baldwin, the “formbook” has been for a former Foreign Secretary, Chancellor, or Home Secretary to become prime minister. Only four Prime Ministers have ever become PM without previously holding Cabinet positions, of which two are Tony Blair and David Cameron. He clearly regrets both their premierships: he was explicit about Blair; in another context (his defence of our monarch as head of state), he added the vision of a President Cameron as almost as disagreeable as a President Blair.

In 2016, Rees-Mogg had offered support to Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, and Andrea Leadsom successively as their bids collapsed. Now, Johnson appears to be Rees-Mogg’s favourite. Explicitly, he said that “Boris is a brilliant foreign secretary” because he represents Britain’s interests abroad. Since that is what he urges May to do as premier, logically Johnson would suit him better as premier.

Curiously, Rees-Mogg undermined many of the candidates by raising the advantage of maturity. This may have been intended as a dig at Blair and Cameron, who became premiers in their forties. Rees-Mogg said that we should welcome a candidate aged 70, but I could not discover whom he might have in mind (Sajid Javid is 48; Michael Gove is nearly 51; Boris is 54; Amber Rudd is nearly 55; Liam Fox is pushing 57; Theresa May is 61; Rees-Mogg is barely 49).

Rees-Mogg says that he is “not a realistic prospect” for election to leader, because he must be elected by MPs, whatever his popularity with others. He seems to have social conservatism in mind, which is rooted explicitly in his Catholicism. When asked about the influence of his Catholicism on his politics, he said the only fundamental influence was “the value of every soul,” which influences his politics on human life, but being a Catholic “doesn’t mean I have a hotline to the Vatican” on other issues – such as how to vote on Heathrow’s third runway.

What I am saying is that the Czech Resistance movements started an uprising in the city and countryside as the Americans and Soviets approached Prague. Stationed near Prague was a contingent of German Army Eastern European Volunteers of the Russian Liberation Army. Most of these were anti-Bolshevik / Soviet Russians who were eventually allowed to form an Army under Germany's control. These guys joined the German Army for a myriad of reasons, but a lot of it was a mix of opportunism (to get out of POW Camps after being captured while they were in the Red Army, which were essentially death camps for Soviet POWs), and hatred for Communism / Soviet Union; especially in the Ukrainian units, which suffered the ""Holodomor"" (genocide by starvation) at the hands of Stalin in the 1930s, losing millions of people. And in the Russian units many hated the Soviet Union for suffering brought on their families during and after the Russian Civil War (many of the Russians in the RLA were former ""whites"").  Many rightfully still hated Stalin and the USSR and saw the Germans as liberators (they were very wrong). As the war progressed and ethnic ""Aryan"" German soldiers were dying in the meat grinder that was World War II (namely the Eastern Front) the Nazi officials lessened ethnic  restrictions on joining the Wehrmacht and the Waffen SS. They sought out help from where they could get it in all but a few categories were allowed to join the German Military: Jews, Gypsies, ethnic Poles (ethnic Germans living in Poland were allowed to join), Czechs etc... otherwise most Europeans were allowed to join. So a lot of Eastern Europeans volunteered, especially when they saw how horrible treatment the Nazis were bringing on the local populaces. Better to join them than fall victim to them was on many minds. 

Now these Eastern European former Soviet citizens fighting for Nazi Germany realized their goose was cooked. The Nazis were about to lose the war, and they (both Germans and Foreign Volunteers) knew that if they were captured by the Red Army they would, be beaten, tortured and eventually killed at worst, or at best shipped off to  a Gulag in Siberia. So what could they do?


They decided to mutiny against the ethnic German Military units and help fight along side the Czech Resistance. Why?

In their minds this action of throwing off their Nazi chains and fighting against the Germans (even though they joined the Germans Military)  would ingratiate themselves to the Western Allies, and allow them some leniency when the Americans rolled in to town. All similar collaborationist units wanted to fall in to Western Allied hands and not Soviet hands, because they figured they would be given better treatment and rights as POWs. This was not an uncommon occurrence at the end of the war, where foreign volunteer units fighting for Germany mutinied against the Germans and openly fought them in hopes of currying favor with the Western Allies - so as to be granted leniency and not be repatriated to the Soviets. 

However, as these Eastern European Wehrmacht Mutineers joined forces with the Czechs to rid themselves of the Germans, thinking Patton and his US troops would roll in to Prague, they didn't realize that politics had forced a pissed off Patton to halt his advances towards Prauge and leave it to the Red Army. 


Some units tried fighting towards American lines to surrender to them, others along with Czech Resistance fighters went under ground or fled, while some decided to stay with German die hard SS units and fight on in the hinterlands. 

The ""Liberation"" of Prague was very complex and very tragic for thr Czech people.


Now the Cezchs did not want to be under Nazi rule. They suffered immensely, especially after.the assassination of RH. They hated the Nazis. But they didn't want to trade one oppressor for another, and wanted to determine their own freedom and destiny (which was democratic not Communist). But the powers that be left Czechoslovakia  to fall under Soviet control, just like Poland (which also didn't want to be Communist either). But politics were complex and Stalin needed to be placated.

And as less people are required to produce the food, clothing, and material goods we need to live our lives comfortably - more people can pursue training and advancement in the arts and sciences.

This development is separate from the economic system it exists within, and is the product of human minds and hands. Not the flow of capital and money. That flow conditions, shapes and limits the advancements made, however, as we can see in the sciences and arts today. Under a system driven by profit, only those development which are profitable will be encouraged. Without the money to survive, much less fund your research and work, you can't pursue certain things at all!

Even just two hundred years ago, we lived in a world where most people labored their lives as farmers and ranchers. Urbanization developed alongside capitalism. In Medieval Europe, 90% of the population labored just to produce the food and basic necessaries of life for the other 10%. Thanks to advances in agriculture like crop rotation, pesticide and better strains, fewer people were required to produce the same amount of food, however. And because of the massive deaths of the Black Plague - workers were in higher demand, and could in turn make more extensive demands of their bosses! 

This went alongside the formation of the guilds which empowered artisans (though they had deep flaws), the development of national and church-run school systems which brought literacy to many landless workers, and the development of science and even more technology! We now live in a world where only 3% of the population is required to produce 90% of our food.

Those gains are what ultimately enabled the growth of industrial capitalism out of the agrarian feudalism that had existed prior to it, and the refocusing of society's resources on commodity production, of things like clothes and toys and cars.

And we've seen something very similar through the 20th century and the High-Tech Revolution.

Because of developments in computers and robotics, fewer factory workers are necessary to produce those goods needed for our modern lifestyles. Factory work and human labor are still in use in much of the third world, but that is a result of the economic conditioning. Not technological growth.

Profit-seeking will use whatever the cheapest production method is. And when labor in a third world country is cheaper, because of differences in the cost-of-living, it will be used. Even at the expense of those workers own safety and lives.

Because of that combination of outsourcing and automation, though we have seen a move in the first world towards a service-sector based economy. Because we are now at a time when the vast majority of our hands aren't needed for the production of necessities at all.

This trend will continue under socialism, but profit-seeking won't exist as a driving force because we will be living in a post-profit world. Most existing and formerly-existing socialist states came to be in much less developed economies, and at a time when factory-labor still dominated. What a socialist state in the previously-first-world would look like, we don't know.

I'd say that as soon as you are more interested in ensuring that these people end up in Europe than you are in rescuing them, you become part of the problem.

The reality is of course very simple: The only way to stop people from getting on these boats and thus risking their lives and needing rescue is to eliminate the need for them to get on boats. You can either do this by ferrying everybody who desires into Europe, in effect completely opening the borders, or you can prevent anyone from landing in Europe thus making such a journey pointless, in effect completely closing the borders. This rescuing of people at sea and depositing them in Europe, how noble it might be, is in the end part of the problem by encouraging people to get on the boats.

In all the cases, the west prefer islamisized and weak countries who are not gonna put an economic or military competition to them, and they don't like democracies, they prefer dictatorships where they can speak with a single leader and secure their interests for decades, with a president changing every four years that would be difficult. And it's not a secret that before trump, the west did nothing to stop ISIS, they waited for them to take down assad before moving, turkey opened the borders for them to join syria, France gave the cement for the undergrounds, saudi and qatar gave money, UK and USA gave satellite data. And ben laden probably didn't even plan the 9/11, he has a video where he says that he is innocent. The west reached a level where islam became a tool for them. If they wanted, terrorism would disappear, but they can't abandon a so powerful tool ,in the near futur, they will use it against china, what’s happening in Myanmar is a preparation triggered by the saudis, and now they're creating a huge network of 500 mosques in Bangladesh to recruit jihadis from the rohingyas who lost everything.

All this, is concerning the islamic world. For the west itself, things are different, those western powers who control islam overseas, doesn't control it in their own countries, because overseas, the ones playing are away from the radars, secret services, NATO, multinationals using crazy networks of bank accounts, in the inside, things are different, politicians are watching, the law and freedoms are watching, islam is related to social phenomenon and culture, no games no tricks, the west brought muslims from poor countries because the industry needs workforce, but they can't control it, you can't control what parents are gonna tell their children in their mother tongues, or what the imam is gonna say in paki or arabic, politicians just put them in closed neighborhoods, and let them between themselves. What i see is that saudis are financing extremists in europe, trying to convert people from the muslim community, i'm sure they're acting under US orders, but why is the US doing this, European countries agree with this or not ? is this a plan to weaken europe or is it planned by European themselves to start the cosmopolite project of a world without borders, what is see is that not every European country agree with what’s happening..... For turkey, i'm sure that no one is controlling them, they just want to spread influence, in all the cases, what's happening is bad, I feel that they lost control, and the people who’re suffering are the apostates and seculars living inside this closed culture. You said that Muslims cant’ act just by hearing a hadith, yes, but they’re forced to agree with the content, mo took a six years, they must agree with it, and agreeing with it will give a probability seeing it happening. Mo stoned, maybe they will not stone, but they must agree with it, that’s exactly what the video is about. I'm just afraid that the number of people thinking like that will start to grow more and more, even if the law prohibits some behaviors, if the neighborhood is entirely inhabited by people agreeing with the behavior, they will force it. And the minorities of the neighborhood will suffer, this is not even theoretical this is happening. So speakers and imams need to secularize people, preach a lighter and tolerant version of islam, if politicians lost control, this is what they must start doing, if they have some kind of conspiracy plan for europe, that i can't speak about but they're wrong if they think that multiculturalism must be forced this way without careful planning.

&gt;-Where would you move to learn about Dutch culture, or to do your best to become an honorary dutchman?

Any small village outside of the Randstad area. Larger cities are very international and it's tempting to stay in an English speaking expat bubble there. 

-Where would you go to make a comfortable living in tech?

Amsterdam or other cities in Randstad area or Eindhoven.

&gt;-Is Amsterdam all it's cracked up to be?

If you ask me, an Amsterdammer: yes. It's beautiful, it has a lot to offer culturally (art, music, etc), i't small enough to feel cozy but internatiional enough to feel cosmopolitan. For some reason Amsterdam gets a lot of hate from people from other parts of the country. Possible reason: they only know the tourist trap part of the inner city. Big downside: shortage of housing and ridiculous prices.

&gt;Is the weather comparable to where I am? 

I checked, and temperature wise it's not that different except we have quite a bit of rain all seasons.

Maybe not.

Caretakers in Europe, Japan, Latin America etc. manage to do this just fine, and the vast majority of men live and die with their penises in the condition they were born with, and are thankful they didn't have part of their penis cut off as soon as they were a baby. What's wrong with America?

Are you sure he HAD to get circumcised? Was complete surgical removal of this body part the only way to prevent future problems? Given how rampant forced retractions of children are, do you think it's likely there was another way of preventing these things other than surgical amputation?

&gt;If you think circumcision is some obtuse religious practice, all I can say is best of luck not having your children vaccinated either. Science!

Well when you look at that map this entire discussion thread has revolved around and how it's most prevalent in regions where it is basically an obtuse religious practice (or the history of the procedure until the mid 19th century), I think that's a perfectly valid conclusion.

*Putin's Asymmetric Assault on Democracy in Russia and Europe: Implications for US National Security - A Minority Staff Report Prepared for the use of the Committee on Foreign Relations - US Senate, 115th Congress, 2nd Session, January 10, 2018*

&gt;The Nordic states continue to raise their populations’ awareness of and resiliency to Kremlin disinformation campaigns. In advance of a military exercise in Sweden, which also included the other Nordic states, the Baltics, and the United States, the defense ministries of Sweden and Denmark released a joint statement announcing their intention to team up to deter Russian government cyberattacks and disinformation operations. And **Sweden, which will hold elections in 2018, has begun ramping up its defenses against disinformation operations through its Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB). The agency has picked up on fake news stories that push narratives claiming that Sweden is a war zone and the rape capital of Europe, and that it has banned Christmas lights and the eating of bacon on trains.** Echoing the U.S. experts hired by Finland, the head of MSB’s global analysis and monitoring section, Mikael Tofvesson, has emphasized that the MSB’s strategy is not to fight fire with fire, noting that:

&gt;**‘‘It’s like mudwrestling a pig. You’ll both get dirty, but the pig will think it’s quite nice. This plays into their hands, whereas for us getting dirty is just a pain. Instead, we have to try to stay clean and focus on the part of our society that has to work: democracy and freedom of expression, to make sure that giving the citizens correct information becomes our best form of resistance.’’** (page 111)

&gt; Please correct this garbled gibberish into something remotely comprehensible and coherent. Also, next time produce a working URL.

I was typing on my phone.  Again you're attacking what was clearly a typing error as if it's relevant.  

But while we're on this sort of attack, lets list logical fallacies and point out how you've used them

* Ad Hominem Fallacy: You've attacked and mislabelled me throughout

* Straw Man:  You've attacked things that I don't even claim.

* Appeal to emotion:  I've already addressed this in part 1

* False Dilemma/False Dichotomy:  Again related to the labelling, you lump anyone who voted for Brexit in the same category, this is what they are, they can't be anything else.

* Slippery Slope:  The whole remain debate past the point of agreeing a deal and actually getting out of Brexit isn't addressed. It's just plain catastrophe and disaster from thereon out.  No, it's probably not.  It'll be costly at first of course, which we'll no doubt bounce back from as countries usually do from a period of economic difficulty, and have done before.  As a nation we're perfectly capable of not going into a horrendous spiral with no way out.  The doom isn't real.

* Hasty Generalization:  Fits in with the black and white thinking in regards to who voted for Brexit and your inability to not lump me in with your fictional generalisations.  I'd also include your idea that anyone on the right supports Brexit and is a certain way to the point of having tell-tale signs.

* Causal Fallacy:  I know nothing about science apparently. You had no information to support that notion but pulled it out of your ass anyway.

* Appeal to Authority: You do provide links in the final section, but as you have throughout, failed to provide any reasoning as to why they are correct.  If you provide links to ""experts"" (I mean come on, the open democracy link is a joke) that are throwing mights and maybes without any real conclusion about what will happen, then what are you actually debating?  How does it address any of my points?  You're using names to hide the fact that you're not actually using the points to address anything I've said specifically.




And onto my final point.

&gt; &gt; However were not going to lose the countrys wealth overnight
&gt;
&gt; This is a straw man hyperbole, though.
 
Ok, since you insist on attacking the wording rather than the clear meaning of it, I'll rephrase. I don't believe there's any doom scenario.
Sure a hard Brexit is going to be more costly, but I don't believe it would spell doom for the UK.  As in your linked articles, some cry out doom the end of the world, others say the same thing without the dramatics.  There's lots of coulds and mays, and if this then that scenarios that may not even come to be.  

While this list is wishy washy (again a list of coulds and mights)

https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/brexit-what-next-reasons-to-be-positive-eu-referendum-jeremy-corbyn-a7104016.html

(Notice here how I use the link to make a specific point)
A valid point in there is that the UK can make of itself what it chooses to make of itself, in the sense that there are new opportunities that come out of it and they'll be what we make of them. (And not in the sense of undoing changes that the EU influenced in the country, thought I'd point that out since I'd kind of expect you to respond that way at this point)

I won't respond again.  I mostly wanted to quote your own text and point out what a complete hypocritical lying shithead you've been all while pompously maintaining that you're more educated and have been a model debater.


And because experience with your responses leads me to believe that you'd just flat out deny the last section, one more quote.
Along with a reminder that I've so far backed up every point I've made with a quote, and shown you to have lied in multiple instances already.

&gt; You don't get a productive debate when honesty is an alien concept to you. Once you rediscover that and no longer make claims lacking any basis in fact or which completely defy common sense, you'll be able to productively debate again. 
&gt; You know very little to completely nothing about Brexit, and the gap between your lack of knowledge and your arrogant rhetoric is extremely noticeable. I'd advise you to refrain from commenting on this topic.

I'll admit that I only know of you what you've said to me.  But my god in such a small amount of time you've led me to believe that you're an arrogant liar who cares little about polite interaction with others.  I hope that this exchange isn't a good representation of you for your own sake and the sake of people who meet you.

Change in regulations moves very slowly in India (although the authorities are starting to finally wake up to the fact that they have to react quickly to not be left behind in the Blockchain tech race), and the way of doing business and the sense of professionalism may be different to the way your expect (if living in North America, Europe, Australia etc).  

The base of tech engineers / talent at Nucleus Vision's disposal is a major factor I believe in what will deliver success for Nucleus Vision. In investing in Nucleus, I am investing in India's overall adoption of blockchain. I'm also investing in Nucleus Vision being a first-mover in India, and in the team and strategy  - aligning with the Indian government and top retailers (to begin).  

Nucleus Vision are co-hosting the largest blockchain conference in Hyderabad with the government at the beginning of August. This is smart.

A. Artistic genius isn't real, it is a myth introduced by Giorgio Vasari, and perpetuated by the European art academy. Art is taught, it is a skill, no one starts drawing like that without years of practice. The idea that you can spontaneously start doing it is as absurd as picking up a violin for the first time and playing a flawless Mozart concerto.

B. All of the images shown have characteristic features of drawings made from photograph-e.g expressions &amp; poses that would be impossible for the models to hold over a few hours, distinct droplets of water/sweat, etc. Nothing wrong with that, plenty of artists work that way, yet in the video the boy is shown improvising from a live model, because that is how laymen imagine all artists work--so already the actual technique is hidden in favor of a layman stereotype. 

C.   The boy is fake-drawing throughout the video, he draws a circle, and then immediately the video cuts to him drawing on top of an already well-defined face. If you look, you will notice that the circle he draws doesn't even match up with the position or shape of the head that results. He is literally cross-hatching over a pre-sketched face by another artist. The image that he is producing doesn't look anything like the finished images either, they are not built up from the sort of rough cross-hatching we see him apply--he is laying down thick, distinct lines, while all the finished works don't have any such lines visible, and nothing covering them up either--they should still be visible when the drawing is finished.

TL:DR The drawings are by his teacher, who appears in the video. The teacher is very talented, but people don't generally care about talented adult artists, thus the false premise.

So while you're listening to what others say about him, I'm enjoying skyrocketing employment, an incredible stock market, the destruction of ISIS, peace talks beginning on the Korean peninsula, strong border control, and an end to trade deals that unfairly target the US. 

&gt;He is leaving trade deals left and right.

Which has he left? Why? Please provide examples for this claim, as well as his reasoning for it. Could these trade deals have been unfair for America? (Hint: Research 'tariffs', and how high they are for each country).

&gt;He is backstabbing his the US's closest allies by suddenly imposing tariffs under the pretense of ""national security"". 

He says he wants to end tariffs. ALL tariffs. 

https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/09/politics/trump-g7-tariffs-trade/index.html

But since other countries refuse, he's willing to bump the US's tariffs up to match those of our so-called ""allies"". 

Also regarding national security: Are you referring to the metal tariffs imposed on Canada?

Do you know what Chinesium is, and how this inferior metal is bought from China by third parties in Canada, repackaged as NAFTA-Brand metal, and sold to America? Do you know how much metal is used by our military?

&gt;Furthermore, he seems hellbent on diving and screwing over the EU and Europe as much as humanly possible.

How? The euro-skeptic movement predates Trump, and has been exacerbated by the EU itself. Refugee crisis? The Greek Debt Crisis? The recent internet legislation?

Methinks the EU is screwing itself.

&gt;He wants to weaken Europe, which is exactly what Putin wants.

Why does Putin want this? What motive does he have to cripple such a valuable trade partner?

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26436291

&gt;Trump has also made a bunch of statements to reduce the US role NATO and especially their presence in Europe.

http://money.cnn.com/2016/07/08/news/nato-summit-spending-countries/index.html

Seems America is, once again, calling out the bullshit of other countries and trade groups. 

&gt;The US is present there only because of Russia, and now they're taking away support in that region?

Again, you equate words with actions. Show me where he's removed support. He's *threatened* it, just as you'd threaten to kick out a dead-beat kid if they refused to get a job. If other countries refuse to match the agreed-upon spending, then yeah, he should pull out. It's their asses on the line, not ours.

&gt;Furthermore, while doing all of this he is holding a meeting with Putin as we speak, instead of his allies in the EU and Canada, which he is currently blackmailing.

He's not blackmailing them. I don't even know if you know what that word means. Is he *threatening* them? Sure. Is he using incriminating evidence to make them act as he wants? No. 

Regarding the meeting: He's already met with them at a little meeting called ""The G7""; a meeting Russia wasn't invited to attend. Now given the fact Russia is soooo massive and such an important global power, I'd say it's a good idea for us to meet with them on peaceful terms; especially since they have enough nukes to glass the planet.

In conclusion: You confuse words with reality and are lost in a conspiracy theory that's sent you adrift in an ocean of nonsense. You assume America trying to fight for its own self interests is somehow malicious, even though the countries negatively affected by such an act are ones that have taken advantage of the US for decades. The tariffs he's fighting against were put in place in the post-war world to keep the decimated Europe competitive with America, but since they're no longer a destroyed continent, it's completely within Trump's right to negotiate better trade on behalf of the country he was elected to govern.

False,SupaZupa,1508140408.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_c6xnv6z,"&gt;Labour has demanded Theresa May ban the “cruel and inhumane” practice of gay conversion therapy as the government prepares to publish its major LGBT+ action plan.

&gt;The party’s call comes as the prime minister is set to launch her proposals later this week, alongside the world’s largest survey of LGBT+ people, detailing the responses of 108,000 individuals in the UK.

&gt;Labour claims the controversial practice – sometimes referred to as “gay cure” – which aims to change or alter an individual’s sexual orientation has “spread fear and hatred” in society and calls for legislation from ministers to make it illegal.

&gt;Several organisations, including NHS England, the British Psychological Society, and the Royal College of Psychiatrists published a “memorandum of understanding” in 2014 describing conversion therapy as “unethical and potentially harmful”.

&gt;Despite campaigns and attempts by backbench MPs to ban the practice there are currently no laws against the practice and the LGBT+ charity, Stonewall, suggests there is evidence that individuals continue to experience the therapies. 

&gt;The organisation’s “Unhealthy Attitudes” report, published in 2015, claimed that one in 10 health and social care staff have witnessed colleagues express the belief that sexual orientation can be “cured”.

&gt;In 2016, Malta became the first European country to outlaw conversion therapy after the country’s parliament voted unanimously for a bill which detailed fines and jail sentences for any individual found guilty of trying to “change, repress or eliminate a person’s sexual orientation, gender identity and/or gender expression”.

&gt;Labour’s Dawn Butler, the shadow equalities minister, said: “We must finally see an end to cruel and inhumane conversion therapies, which have been allowed to spread fear and hatred in our society for far too long.”

&gt;Ahead of the publication of the LGBT+ action plan, the party also urges ministers to reinstate cuts to the administrative equalities budget, which has almost halved since 2010.

&gt;According to a written ministerial statement last month, the Government Equalities Office received £9.5m in 2010-11 and this fell to £4.6m in 2017-18. In the current financial year, £5.3m has been earmarked by the Treasury for the equalities office.

&gt;Its programme budget, however, rose from £6.2m in 2010-11 to £9.6m in 2017-18 and an additional £10m was allocated to the budget for the centenary and returners project to spend between 2017-20. The former is to celebrate 100 years of voting rights for women while the latter is to support people returning to work after long breaks.

&gt;Ms Butler added: “The Conservatives have slashed funding for equalities in half since 2010. How can Theresa May claim to be tackling burning injustices, while cutting the funding to achieve this?

&gt;“The government’s action plan must address all forms of discrimination and inequality facing LGBT+ people. This will require resources, and a reversal of their own policies.

&gt;“Theresa May must stop dragging her feet on updating the Gender Recognition Act. It’s a disgrace that the Government’s consultation hasn’t started a year after it was promised.

&gt;Speaking in May, the prime minister said the action plan will present “concrete steps” to improve the lives of LGBT+ people in Britain, adding: “I want to help make us a country where no one feels the need to hide who they are or who they love.”

False,Joaoseinha,1356808645.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_a1f3h,"I'd say ESO. It does work for some of the things you've said.

You can do a lot of different stuff in ESO, from going on a stealing spree (my personal favorite way to make money as a member of the Thieves Guild) to questing to doing delves or dolmens, dungeons, PvP and so on.

It's not set in the Middle Ages, being set in the Elder Scrolls universe, but depending on your knowledge of Elder Scrolls lore you'll know some provinces are more ""familiar"" than others. A character in the Daggerfall Covenant spends a large portion of their time in High Rock, which aside from Cyrodiil is the province closest to a Medieval Europe setting.

Community's also not small by any means (it's definitely a top 5 MMO in population right now), but I'd say it's friendly enough and friendlier than most MMOs' communities. Plus, considering the world is de-leveled the players are all spread out so you'll not run into places absolutely crammed with people most of the time, though you'll certainly run into people in the main cities of each area like Vulkhel Guard in Auridon.

Gameplay's debatable, some people don't like the combat. For me, the combat's fine. If you've ever played Skyrim, it's basically a mix between that and traditional MMO combat with some action combat aspects like dodging. It's not the most mindblowing combat system out there but it does the job just fine in my opinion.

The professions are simple to learn but they are pretty interesting in my opinion. Once again, if you've played an Elder Scrolls game you'll know sort of how it works. Alchemy for example, you have to go around looking for all sorts of ingredients from mushrooms to herbs and flowers. As you make potions you discover different traits for each of the ingredients, and eventually you start figuring out most of each ingredient's traits which allows you to mix them in optimal ways (like knowing three ingredients all with the same 3 traits to create a potion that uses those three traits, like a HP/Stamina/Magicka restoring potion). 

Still fairly new to the game but other crafting professions have similar things. In armor and weapon crafting professions you can craft different styles of armor or weapon. For example, you craft iron armor in orcish style, but later on you might find a crafting motif (basically a new crafting style) for ancient elven gear which allows you to craft iron armor in ancient elf style, but as you progress your craft you learn how to craft armor with better metals and so on. You also have different traits you can craft into the armor when you make it. This is basically what adds an element of complexity into crafting. Along with that, after you craft a piece of armor you can have it enchanted by someone with a good enchanting skill (or do it yourself, provided you've leveled that crafting skill high enough to make good glyphs). So this ties into another profession which uses runes found in the world to craft Glyphs, which are basically enchantments you apply to gear.

That's just a fairly basic description of how some of the crafting works, but I'm by no means an expert. I'm still pretty new to the game, but I'm having a blast so far.

The music is nice in my opinion, but it's pretty subjective.

There's plenty to explore though, that much is a fact. The game takes place in the continent of Tamriel, and as of writing this post a bit over half the continent is explorable. The world isn't entirely seamless, you can walk from area to area but there are loading screens separating the greater areas.

Going back into the exploring thing though, this is where the game shines the most in my opinion. This game is a dream come true for fans of the Elder Scrolls but even newcomers to the universe will be happy with the diverse places they can explore. 

I think it's easier to show the diversity of the world through pictures though, so here's a picture of a few different provinces which all have different cultures, home races, climates and architecture:

[The province of High Rock is pretty similar to Medieval Europe, with warring kingdoms.](https://image.cemmos.net/f533a70aa0942b6fedc52733b348470c86222e0c?url=http://static.elderscrollsonline.com/assets/img/interactive-map/screenshots/Interactive_Map_Stormhaven.jpg)

[Hammerfell is mostly deserts and such, it's located close to High Rock and around half the province is currently explorable](https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/cms/2016/02/5f292b531ff36aba59a2595a1a1971c1.jpg)

[The main island of the Summerset Isles, home of the high elves.](https://esosslfiles-a.akamaihd.net/cms/2018/03/d0ff82eabd2a82657064ad835759e02c.jpg)

As for the latter, for group activities you have plenty of things such as PvP, group dungeons, world bosses, trials, dolmens and so on. Questing in my opinion is better done solo and for solo activities you also have things like Delves (basically instanced mini-dungeons that you can run solo or with other random people). Even public dungeons and world bosses can be solo'd later on depending on your build from what I hear.

Post came out much bigger than expected but oh well. Personally I'm sad I didn't get on the ESO train sooner so if this helps even one person give the game a chance I'm happy.

The July Crisis was a series of interrelated diplomatic and military escalations among the major powers of Europe in the summer of 1914 that was the penultimate cause of World War I. The crisis began on June 28, 1914, when Gavrilo Princip, a Serbian and Yugoslavic partisan, assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne. A complex web of alliances, coupled by miscalculations by many leaders that war was in their best interests or that a general war would not occur, resulted in a general outbreak of hostilities among every major European nation in early August 1914.

Austria-Hungary viewed the irredentist movements of South Slavs, as promoted by Serbia, to be a threat to the unity of the nation. Following the assassination, Austria sought to inflict a military blow on Serbia to demonstrate strength and so Serbia would be more cautious about supporting Yugoslavic nationalism.

O país conheceu um crescimento económico apreciável, acima da média europeia, o que fez subir a popularidade de Cavaco Silva.

Paralelamente foi feita uma reforma fiscal, que introduziu o IRS e o IRC, reformaram-se as leis laborais e agrárias e liberalizou-se a comunicação social, de que resultou a abertura da televisão à iniciativa privada e, consequentemente, numa maior liberdade e independência da informação.

Coincidindo com o abrandamento da actividade económica, os últimos anos do XII Governo, ficaram também marcados pela contestação social às reformas do «cavaquismo».

A fitting quote from Robert Wright's 2001 book *Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny*:

&gt; This is one irony of globalization. The impetus behind it is strong largely because individual states see their long-term interest lies in plugging into the system. But when the system hits a downturn, they would be better off if somehow they could magically become less plugged in—temporarily, at least. Modern China survived the early ravages of the 1997 Asian financial crisis in good shape partly because its currency was not easily convertible into other currencies. Even so, China stuck to its plans for convertibility, because in the long run you're better off plugged in.

&gt; China, of all nations, should know. Its epic mistake—the mistake that got it labeled an underachiever—was unplugging from the system beginning in the late fourteenth century. The consequences of this, a single political decision, have ever since been taken as some deep anti-modern streak in the Asian character.

&gt; The unplugging came during the Ming dynasty, which reigned from 1368 to 1644. When the Ming vanquished the Mongols, it was in theory a glorious moment for China: renewed native control after a century of barbarian rule. But since these particular barbarians had been a gateway to global commerce, the truth was more complicated. The Mongols still controlled trade routes in central Asia, but were now less enthusiastic about using them to channel commerce toward China. Besides, the Ming rulers weren't big on free trade. Ever fearful of incursion, they constricted overland commerce in iron, arms, even textiles, lest these things empower barbarian neighbors yet again. As if to provide future historians with a nice symbol for a siege mentality, Ming emperors built the Great Wall of China.

&gt; The lack of overland trade needn't, by itself, have been devastating. There was always the sea. But Ming rulers proved touchy about contact not just with barbarians, but with aliens of a manifestly refined variety. […] The irony of this isolationism is that during the early Ming period the Chinese were king of the seas. […]

&gt; The reasons for China's withdrawal are much debated. […] The historian John King Fairbank concluded simply that ""anti-commercialism and xenophobia won, and China retired from the world scene."" […] The historian Peter Perdue sees China consciously shifting resources from one vast project—ocean voyages that had shown little profit—to another vast project: building the Great Wall to keep barbarians at bay. […]

&gt; Whatever the cause for China's withdrawal, the timing was bad. For centuries, China had been a big exporter of good ideas, and western Europe a big importer. Now, just as Europe's social brain was really humming, China opted out of the exchange.",True,False,False,,0,1530502559,,False,0,e1n084n,False,t3_8vdlp6,False,t1_e1mj50g,/r/politics/comments/8vdlp6/a_leaked_trump_bill_to_blow_up_the_wto/e1n084n/,,1535568572,50,False,True,False,politics,t5_2cneq,r/politics,public,

False,YouHaveToGoHome,1483428349.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_143nc6,"&gt;Don’t you think trump has to reduce legal immigration to balance out all of the illegal immigration that goes on? 

No. Legal immigration, asylum/refugee resettlement, and amnesty/tolerance for illegal immigration serve different purposes. Legal immigration is designed around our economic needs and basically serves as our bid for the best talent (y'all have seen the test scores; don't kid yourself that our native labor force is the best) and cheap labor. What we do around the other two forms of migration is essentially our humanitarian mission. While too much immigration can strain a country's resources and cause cultural tension, the US is nowhere near this level. From 1870-1900, the US saw nearly half a million immigrants per year over a native population of around 60 million, while today the US has around one million immigrants a year over a native population of 350 million; that's a two-third reduction per capita (if you think we have ""too many people"", the US has doubled its population since 1960, has 2.5x the land area of the EU and 3/5 the population, and has 1/5 the population of China, an economic powerhouse, in almost double the land area.) Despite the fact that the population of illegal immigrants [has decreased by about one million people](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/27/5-facts-about-illegal-immigration-in-the-u-s/) since 2007 due to the recession, the Trump administration has advocated for cutting legal immigration numbers by half. To say that the Trump administration can use this to curb hundreds of thousands of legal immigrants per year is ridiculous. 

I'm of the opinion that we should be increasing legal immigration in order to support our native population and remain competitive in the global economy. On the first point, fertility rates are falling and rural America is graying as young people seek economic opportunities and higher quality of life in the urban areas. This mean quite a lot of towns [filled with elderly people who don't have anyone to take care of them or provide services.](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/06/the-graying-of-rural-america/485159/) We should be using legal immigration as a source of labor to take care of these people and rejuvenate the towns. On the second point, we need to be grabbing as much labor talent as we can from other countries in order to remain competitive with China. As someone who works in finance and tech, it's scary how rapidly China has advanced on machine learning, fabrication, material science, biotech, and consumer electronics either through R&amp;D or stealing from foreign companies; the majority of machine learning and material science papers are now published in China. We're lucky China has decided to focus inward rather than outward for development -- for now. Think, with 5x the population of the US, China's education system only needs to be 1/5 as good as the American one in order for it to realize an equivalent class of scientists, artists, and entrepreneurs. We should be going into brain drain mode HARD in the same way we competed for German scientists with the Soviet Union after WWII.

Fun Fact, he declared it illegaly, because there were 1.25 million Aboriginal Australians that he conveniently decided to ignore because they weren't working the land in the European sense (fences, cleared fields). But they did work the land, they cultivated the bush, by planting fruit trees along the trail between settlements, by growing yams on the banks of rivers, making bread out of Bogong Moth flour, having established huntings seasons so that they didn't over hunt different species.

It compares perhaps more to larger confederal state or a supranational entity like the EU. Contrary to popular believe the HRE functioned quite well - all things considered - right up until 1806. Early on East Francia (the name HRE is actually a later and not often used one) was quite powerful and this forestalled the struggles of the West Francian kings with their powerful nobles. And no, this is actually different from the struggles the HRE later had (with its powerful constituent members) as by that time we’ve been through centuries of institutional evolution.

The HRE over the course of centuries evolved to a decentralisation of power, but not as simple as one may think. A focal point of difference with for example what became France is that the devolution of power went hand in hand with making *stakeholders* of its constituent members. Whereas later a Bourbon king eventually had to go up against his powerful nobility, the rulers of the HRE made these nobles part of the running of the Empire, which integrated all ruling segments in an interrelated web in - and this is the crux - whose interests it was to actually make things work.

All things considerd the HRE did it different, but different for them worked admirably well - with all its own issues.

And work it did, right up until 1806. No wars broke it before Napoleon, not even the Thirty Years War or Frederick II, the latter who rather used the Empire’s mechanics than oppose them.

My original comment was quote ""capitalist media.""  Social media isn't non-capitalist.  I never said anything originally about 'mainstream media.'  I just used data to show refute the false fact you stated that 'Nobody watches' which itself is not the case.  Then you tried to say the trend of cable media is down, which is still NOT MY POINT.  People swim in news that capitalists create for them.  Liberals take it and disseminate it, interpret it, analyze it, meme it, and whatever.  My original point is still there, you're arguing things that aren't even relevant to that point.

&gt; The reactionaries were able to push their agenda rather easily with much less money than the neo-liberals and much more success than the socialists.

Yes.  There's actually several commentaries about that process on youtube.  Reactionaries are themselves compatible with capitalism and so their 'agenda' properly disguised under things like 'immigration debate' worm their way through the capitalist media.  Further right, into actual organized neo-fascism movements there was a very real conscious effort to provoke anti-fascist action and the hide under liberal conceptions of free speech to get attention and protection from the liberals.  They literally hijacked the news by being unignorable.

&gt; Why don't socialists have our own version of Breitbart, Ben Shapiro, and Milo Yiannopoulos?

These people you mentioned all have heavy funding from third party capitalists, and because they're compatible with capitalism, get higher access to capitalist platforms.  Brietbart was created by the son of an affluent banker.  Ben Shapiro was friends with Brietbart for 14 years and is funded by capitalists to say pro-capitalist right wing things, Milo Yiannopoulos is also tightly linked with Brietbart.  So the answer to your question seems self-evident and part of my original point.  People with more money have more opportunity to buy attention and promote themselves.  Those three you mentioned are specifically upheld and promoted by capitalists for capitalist interests.  

In contrast, people like Jimmy Dore are the focus of intense alt right attacks gaming the system.  

&gt; the main problem for us is the memories of the Cold War and the USSR.

Which is fading hard yes.

&gt; The electoral process isn't effective?

Not at changing the dialectic relationship between the masters and the slave, no.

&gt; If we actually want to empower the proletariat and commit to a new route to socialism that at least has a chance to work, we have a fighting chance.

If by new way you mean revisionist bullshit, it will fail.  At best you will get social democracy out of the system, which is inherently anti-revolutionary.  I don't think we should give up.  Capitalism is self-contradictory.  If we aren't organized and educated, we're basically guaranteeing the dominance of fascism.  I'm all ears for a different way forward, as each country has to deal with its own material conditions, but restricting ourselves to the system arranged for us by our oppressors is basically you saying that we should just beg for freedom until we wear them down.

&gt; You yourself admitted that socialism didn't manage to escape the urban elitist bubble. 

No, I said that it seemed to be more prevalent in places where it was more easily shared.  I never said it was a bubble or elitist or that it hadn't or could escape.  You're bending phrases.

&gt; Socialists need to go directly to them and campaign.

I agree, except that I would say go directly and *organize.*  Campaign is top down, ""Vote for me and I'll do things for you.""  Organize is horizontal, ""We do things as a group for each other.""

&gt; with a handful of college hipsters and no proletarian support.

Ummm... I'm WELL out of college and I sweat for a living so get bent on that incredibly offensive caricature.  It's a conservative meme that just isn't true.  

&gt; Do you expect any country to fund a revolution against the US? No

The US has spent the entire last 80 years screwing over the planet.  Yes.  Emphatically.  If we were at that point where mass support for a change in economic system were a thing, I absolutely expect every country to either align with the Chinese/Russian power block or with the Europenean power block.  If we got to that point it would be a shitshow. 

&gt; They would rather sacrifice themselves to the bourgeoisie than to stand by the immigrants (especially undocumented) the GSD (LGBTQ+) community, the feminist movement, and so on.

A wise general wins the war before fighting it.  I absolutely expect them to do that.  Right now we have mass *liberal* mobilization to stand by undocumented immigrants unironically calling for radical changes like abolishing ICE.  This is why you organize.

&gt; The only way to pull a Ho Chi Minh or Mao Zedong would be to assimilate socialism to the native political culture.

Yes, that's why you have vanguard parties and organization.

&gt; I don't want to have white supremacy and Christian radicalism in my socialism, thank you.

Both of those are reactions to capitalism, not strictly cultural qualities that just come from no where.  Those are the fascists, and they aren't the majority.

&gt; but I see a few key reasons why the Cold War basically ended in the West's favor by 1948.

Congrats.  You totally failed to mention the underlying contradictions inherent in the Soviet form of governance leading to revisionism.

&gt; Stalin's ascension to power. That alone prohibited the masses in the west (or the east without the help of the NKVD for that matter) from supporting the Soviet Union.

Total BS.  That would have occurred regardless of who was in that seat.  Stalin was smeared by the fascists, and the capitalists took on it because they recognized communism as an inherent threat to capitalism.  

&gt; The majority of the Eastern Bloc countries would disagree with you.

No... actually they wouldn't, and no I won't provide evidence for it since the original statement was preposterous on its face and because you've provided nothing concrete to refute.  The US and Russia were not 'alike' in 1924 aside from being a top down undemocratic economy (which if that's what you meant then fine, but Russia's economy was centrally planned and still lacked needed industrialization).  If you're saying the Eastern block countries were unhappy, then I'm sure we could go round and round about what that means.  If you're saying that the eastern block countries were still similar to their old economies and not transformed yet at all... I mean my god, 1924 was what?  2 years after the civil war?

&gt; I'm not a social democrat. 

Then why are you even on about electoralism?

&gt; Millions still starved as a result of poor planning,

Bullshit.  Millions starved because they had famines, insufficient (but transitioning) industrialization, and if we're talking specifically about the holodomor, happened while foreign countries started refusing gold as payment for goods making it difficult to get the needed supplies.  There was also reactionary pushback to collectivization.

&gt; now without autonomy or empowerment, starved.

Yup, nothing to do with their former bosses burying livestock or burning crops, or the whole famine thing.  It had nothing to do with autonomy or empowerment.  What's your source on that?

&gt; Let's not have the proletariat bleed and die en masse from a white terror by the reactionaries.

Would you rather we just asked them nicely?

&gt; Don't commit to a revolution until you know that you at least have a majority or the economic might.

Well yea, you don't run out and hope for the best.  Again... there's a purpose behind a vanguard party (and it's not to BS the proletariat asking for concessions or pretend that electorism will suffice).

&gt; I open my fridge and see steel stacked neatly on the shelves. I walk into a shop and see chains limiting me at the aisles. I basically have my entire extended family either fall into poverty/debt/so on or distance themselves (a bit) because of the chains dragging people into different socioeconomic camps. Unless you went through the same problems, I would suggest that you shove it.

Welcome to the experience of the proletariat.  You aren't alone, but you seem to think that you can change the system while wearing those chains.  You can't.  So either sit down and accept the chains, or do something revolutionary.  If you aren't willing to do something revolutionary, then put the word freedom out of your vocabulary. 

&gt; Find a new alternative.

I'm fine with that, but there's not a chance in hell that you can vote away the power of the bourgeoisie.  None.  

&gt; Put your own self outside of 1937 and look at the 21st century. 

*eyeroll*  I am and have.  There is no peaceful solution to ending capitalism.  The capitalists will literally enslave us all in actual chains at gunpoint before giving up their power.  A century hasn't changed how power works.  I understand the basics of ML, and support ML's, but I never said I *was* only an ML.  Their revolutions have been the only thing to come close, at all, to both succeeding and maintaining power.  The handful of anarchist revolutions have died even quicker, and the democratically elected ones have all been couped pretty much immediately by the capitalists.  The problem with socialism isn't the ideology, it's the counter revolutionaries.

&gt; I will continue to act like an ""ass"" as long as the people before me foolishly venerate an archaic and collapse paradigm for socialism.

Then you will continue to be a counter revolutionary with no answers but self-defeat.  You come here and act like you know everything, but can't even understand how capitalist media works or its relationship to the superstructure.  You have nothing and you know nothing.

Blocked.

&gt; The Police were a new wave band which formed in 1977 in London, England. The band consisted of Sting (vocals, bass), Andy Summers (guitar) and Stewart Copeland (drums).  The band released five albums -- ""Outlandos d'Amour"" (1978), ""Reggatta de Blanc"" (1979), ""Zenyatta Mondatta"" (1980), ""Ghost in the Machine"" (1982) and ""Synchronicity"" (1983) -- before entering a hiatus in 1984 and ultimately disbanding in 1986

&gt; The band reunited in January 2007 for a reunion tour that lasted until August 2008. 

&gt; Biography 

&gt; The Police formed in early 1977 in London by Stewart Copeland (drums), Gordon Sumner, better known as Sting (bass and lead vocals), and Henry Padovani (guitar). Andy Summers later joined the group, and after a very short stint as a quartet, Padovani left the band. The Police became one of the most popular bands in the late 70s and throughout the 80s.

&gt; The Police are notable as one of the first mainstream white pop groups to adopt reggae as a predominant musical form and to score major international hits with reggae-styled material. (The first all-white reggae band with permanent members and frequent recording in Europe was Peps Blodsband, lead by Peps Persson from south Sweden who changed from blues to reggae 1974/75). Although reggae was already very popular in the United Kingdom (due to the large number of Caribbean immigrants) and a number of Western European countries, reggae was little known in the United States and rejected by most black artists in U.S, and prior to the emergence of the Police only a handful of reggae songs had enjoyed any significant chart success. The Police, UB40, The Clash and Bob Marley (Jamaican, partly living in England after being shot in Jamaica, are considered with a number of new wave, rock and ska bands as one of the leaders of the Second British Invasion of the U.S.

&gt; The Police were strongly influenced by reggae (especially reggae drumming and base lines), jazz and, in the beginning, punk rock – something that came to be shifted more and more towards pop during the 80s. Their lyrics also changed from challenging, but yet somewhat politically restrained punk- and new wave lyrics, to after 1982 in some songs emphasize environmental awareness and human oneness. The biggest hits, however, had romantic or sexual themes. The Police met together with other ""white"" British bands which played reggae, as UB40,  criticism from black English rastafarian reggae bands like Aswad (in a BBC documentary on TV) and Steel Pulse, for being accomplices in the music industry of ""Babylon"", stealing the Caribbean slave descendants' musical treasure. This criticism has later been withdrawn. Aswad has even made the covers of Police songs like ""Roxanne"".

&gt; Tension grew between the band members, because unlike most other bands, they did not share songwriting credits. They released their last album, Synchronicity, in 1983, selling over 8 million copies. Synchronicity is critically regarded as their best album, with hits such as Synchronicity II, King of Pain, and probably their best known song, Every Breath You Take. In 1984, after touring in support of Synchronicity, The Police went on hiatus while Sting pursued his acting and solo music careers. Two years later, The Police reformed and played a few concerts for Amnesty International.  Soon after the band went into the studio. Sting wanted to re-record their old songs but Andy and Stewart wanted to leave the originals alone and only two songs were re-recorded during these studio sessions. Although the group is considered to have disbanded in 1984, 1986 was the last time The Police engaged in any musical activity. 

&gt; In 1992 the band released ""Message in a Box"", their 4 CD box set, and performed at Sting's wedding to Trudie Styler.  A live CD was released in June 1995. On March 10, 2003 The Police were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  and performed Message in a Bottle, Roxanne and Every Breath You Take.

&gt; The Police reformed in 2007 and opened the Grammy award ceremony of that year with a performance of Roxanne. Towards the end of May the band began a world tour.  In  2008  the tour ended at Madison Square Garden, New York on August 7, and The Police disbanded for good.  Sting was quoted towards the end of the tour that he had achieved closure with the band and revealed that The Police would never tour or record again. 

&gt; Sting has said that the material on the album Ghost in the Machine were inspired by the writings of Arthur Koestler, and that the Police's final studio album Synchronicity was influenced by the writings of Carl Jung. Sting also peppers his songs with literary allusions: the song ""Don't Stand So Close to Me"" mentions Vladimir Nabokov's  novel Lolita; ""Tea in the Sahara"" alludes to the novel The Sheltering Sky by Paul Bowles; and ""Wrapped Around Your Finger"" refers both to the sea monsters Scylla and Charybdis, from Greek mythology, and to Mephistopheles, from the German legend of Faust .

THE SUN SAYS

GOBBY Irish PM Leo Varadkar has no idea how much damage he does with every Brexit utterance.

His latest salvo revealed a patronising, pompous arrogance as misplaced as it was sickening.
The mighty EU won’t change its rules for little Britain, Varadkar sneered.

“We’re 27 member states — the UK is one country,” he said. “We’re 500million people, the UK is 60million. That basic fact has to be understood.”

The Sun has some more basic facts:

Ireland’s population is 4.8million. The UK’s is 66.5million.

Ireland’s economy relies on us so heavily that a “no deal” is forecast to throw 2.5 per cent of its workforce on the dole. It is far more exposed than any other EU country, or the UK.

Our billions bailed out broke Ireland in 2010. Has Varadkar forgotten?

Is he happy to sour relations with millions of UK customers with long memories, who may take against Irish goods?

A wiser man would have acted as peacemaker, constructively helping both sides forge a historic deal in all our interests, including those of his country and its wonderful people.

Instead he chose another role . . . as the snivelling suck-up egging on the playground bullies.

“He seems to forget in the financial crisis it was Britain that borrowed money to help Ireland when the EU wasn’t prepared to help at all.

“He’s strutting around like he runs the EU and needs to start acting like a friend and neighbour.”

Another trick which often works well with the NHS is to find a specialist who works both privately and for the NHS. You then get a single private appointment with them and ask at the session if you can see them as an NHS patient. It's a way of circumventing a lot of the NHS waiting lists.

To japan it didnt really matter if a city was wiped out by several hundred bombers or a single B29 dropping a bomb. And even japans surrender was not mainly due to the atomic bombings. The soviet declaration of war and following invasion of manchuria had probably an equal or greater effect on the leadership of japan than the atomic bombings.

No, I am demonstrating that JC is a liar by highlighting some of the lies he has unarguably told. JC is a liar or so badly uninformed that he is utterly incompetent. These are demonstrable facts.

&gt; in the process alienating one of the core constituencies you need to win over

Nobody is ever going to win over people who think that JC is infallible. Those people will believe whatever he says. If I started pretending that JC was telling the truth about Brexit, I may as well support his hard Tory-style Brexit. That makes zero sense.

&gt; You can understand why it appears the FBPE thing is like 25% about Brexit and 75% about having a pop at JC.

Well yeah. If you take the discussions about Labour and about Corbyn and ignore most of the rest of it, I guess it might look like that. How many FBPE accounts do you follow? How many times this week have they had a pop at May, Johnson, Davis, Gove, Farrage, and others?

Here *on a forum specifically about Labour*, discussion is likely to *be about Labour*.

&gt; Protest those arseholes, the people who are actually doing this.

I do. A great deal.

The main difference is that if Labour shifted position to an honest one. Brexit would be in big trouble. Watching the sheer incompetence of Labour leadership when they have a chance not only to avoid the silliest act since 1945 but also to split the Tories perhaps permanently is very frustrating. No amount of pressure applied to Gove, Johnson, Davis, May, or Rees-MOgg is going to make them change direction. And the Remainers in the party are frozen out.

So of course they get criticised. But lobbying needs to be directed at Labour. Only Labour can hope to change the direction: and only by telling the truth about Brexit.

&gt; This will just be framed as, 'we think the British Public are stupid.' 

The British people are not stupid. They were taking in by ""lies on an industrial scale"", all of which have since been proven wrong. They were not served by a media which largely failed to question any of the open lies. If I had not been the type to do my own research, and instead just listened to the BBC news and the debates and the interviews, I might have been sold on Brexit myself. I have every sympathy for people who thought the NHS would get £350 million more a week (the lie which the head of Vote Leave said won it). Or that we would get better trade deals. Or that the EU make silly rules (the dozens of myths repeated down the years by the media, again). 

If the main a political party only ever tell lies to voters, who would expect the voters to be informed enough to make a decision, if the media never highlight the lies?

The British public need to be well informed, and to be told which of the Leave promises they voted for will actually come to pass (in this case, zero, as it happens).

&gt;  But the FBPE movement isn't interested in informing people, they are interested in calling Jeremy Corbyn a liar.

um.. do you know what FBPE stands for, why it formed, and what it aims to do?

Because that statement is flatly untrue and against the core reasons for it forming.

I mean, pointing out when Corbyn lies is *one* of the things I do, and *one* of the things that often happens on FBPE accounts. Mainly when he lies about Brexit. But it's not a main aim outside the paranoid delusions of the far-left groups currently sewing disinformation like the stuff you wrote above. You've been had, mate, I'm afraid.

&gt; yet you lose me when you start calling Jeremy Corbyn a liar,

How would you like me to phrase it?

""Jeremy Corbyn has repeatedly made statements on Brexit which were untrue, known to be untrue, demonstrated to be untrue again after he said them the first time, and yet he carries on making flatly untrue statements deliberately""?

Yes, that absolutely contributes to it. Islam is one of the defining features of the region. It has other reasons defining its borders too.

The Middle East is the name the British gave to the Asian part of the Mediterranean. In October 1902, a 20-article series entitled ""The Middle Eastern Question,"" was written by Sir Ignatius Valentine Chirol in The Times. During this series, Sir Igatius defines it as ""those regions of Asia which extend to the borders of India or command the approaches to India."" The region was the battle ground of great empires (Russia, Britain, France, Ottoman) and so needed a term. Asia, of course, includes Asia Minor, which is Turkey.

There is also (rightly or wrongly) a perception of Turks as ancient enemies of Europe/Christendom going back to the destruction of the Roman Empire. Therefore, Turks are seen as the “other” and not European. That is a very deep-seated cultural prejudice that is very hard to erase.

Ultimately, nebulous regions like this are based on perception, and most perceive Turkey to be a Middle Eastern country.",True,False,False,,0,1530527371,,1530527690,0,e1neblw,False,t3_8vgqdf,True,t1_e1ncd0a,/r/europe/comments/8vgqdf/istanbul_gay_pride_march_hit_with_tear_gas_as/e1neblw/,,1535575136,1,False,True,False,europe,t5_2qh4j,r/europe,public,

There will be an automated email, you need to reply to that, then a real human will look at the ticket.

&gt; Opened a thread on the forums after finding their US servers being routed through the netherlands and still not response.

They're **NOT** being routed through the netherlands.  What you might be seeing is the Akamai CDN scrubbing centre.


&gt;93.191.173.113 is a netherlands IP http://ipaddress.is/93.191.173.113

Note that geolocation results are often highly questionable.  For example, sometimes sites think I am in the USA (Florida) when I'm actually in the EU.  It's just that they're using the ownership information for the IP - the corporate IP I am on is owned from the USA whereas it is actually located elsewhere.

In this case, 93.191.173.113 is owned by Prolexic Technologies, which was bought by Akamai a few years ago.  They run the DDoS protection scrubbing centres.  All traffic to ESO is routed via the nearest scrubbing centre, there are 7 worldwide (2 in the USA, 1 in London, one in Frankfurt (Germany), one in Sydney, and I can't remember the location of the others).

&gt;By finding IP address of yourself or a person you wish to lookup, the geolocation lookup tool provide you with an estimate of where this IP address is located. American Registry of Internet Numbers, also known as ARIN, maintains the Whois Database containing contact and registration information for IP addresses. The companies requiring IP addresses obtain and register them with ARIN, and those IP addresses obtained are assigned to their users and customers. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) assign a dynamic IP address to a user when their customers connect to the Internet. **Since a company may be located throughout a large region (or a country), the accuracy of geolocation may vary depending on how they assign them to their users.**

So in my case, they get the wrong continent never mind the country.


-- Edit:

Current scrubbing centre locations: Ashburn, San Jose, Frankfurt, London, Hong Kong, Sydney, Tokyo

Then apparently they are about to open additional centres to make it 16 in total.

We flew into London and stayed at an Airbnb in Zone 2 as the prices in Zone 1 were over our budget. As we were in London for 6 days, we bought a travel card that allowed us unlimited travel in Zone 1 and 2 for a week. This was super convenient as we could go to all the places we wanted to visit really conveniently! I really recommend doing this! For your information, this is not the oyster card but a travel card by National Rail.

We then took the eurostar (we booked it as early as we could as prices increase after that!) to Paris and it was really comfortable, convenient, fast and easy! In Paris, I think we stayed somewhere in the 7th/15th arrondissement, in a cute little Airbnb. It was just beside a metro station, and there were several other metro stations nearby! In Paris, we didn't get any sort of travel card or so but instead bought tickets of 10 which we found was a more cost-saving option. In Paris, we walked a lot, walking even when we could have taken the metro. The main reason was budget but this also allowed us to take in fantastic sights everywhere! Paris is super pretty, love it!

Actually read what I wrote and read your own article!

&gt;Brussels has banned aviation regulators from holding backstop talks with Britain to keep **Europe’s planes** flying in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

It’s *their own planes* they would be grounding! As I said - with nothing in place, no European planes built with British parts would be able to fly - and that’s the Airbuses! That would be more of a nuclear option for themselves than for us!  How is that a sanction when you sanction yourself?! Just because you don’t understand that there needs to be a legal agreement between countries in order to fly planes between them, and an even closer agreement in order to operate flights solely within that area (i.e. not just to or from your own country) does not make it bureaucratic nonsense.  That’s nothing new!  It’s not a sanction.  It would affect their own planes as much if not more than ours and it’s literally how air traffic control works.

Just because the EU does not want a multitude of separate talks operating alongside the Brexit talks, with different sets of contradictory agreements undermining each other (a true bureaucratic nightmare) it does not mean they are refusing agreement.  It just needs to be agreed to in an organised and sensible way as we said we would at the start.

As I said - there are three options

a) stay in the European Common Aviation Area and be subject to European law and the ECJ.

b) form a bilateral agreement like Switzerland and accept some European law and effective ECJ jurisdiction, but lose some of the freedoms

c) Have open skies agreement like the US and EU which would not allow British operators to operate flights within the EU, only to and from the UK, and companies like Ryanair could no longer give us cheap flights within the UK.

Those are the choices.  Britain literally just has to pick one.  We can leave the EU, we can choose the level of cooperation we wish to maintain with them, or we can operate as a third country, but we have to make a choice!  We have to just not pick nothing - the problem is the deadlock within the Conservative Party, and the fact they’ve been lying to the electorate that we can have our cake and eat it in a way no other country does, but that’s not the EU’s fault!

Which would you choose?

Here is my personal breakdown of German politics right now:

**SPD** is dead, only the voters don't know it yet. The core of the SPD is still filled with career politicians who much prefer political infighting to any sort of coherent position or political conviction. I once had the opportunity to be at a social gathering where many low-level SPD people were hanging out and all they talked about was which party-internal grouping is currently ahead in the struggle for control of the party.

**CDU** is clinging to what they remember about conservatism and trying to attach themselves to public opinion. Also, will be plunged into chaos once Merkel resigns.

**AfD, LINKE, CSU** and **FDP** are trying to out-do each other in who can be more of a useful idiot to further Putin's agenda of splitting the EU.

The **Greens** are curiously still a somewhat reasonable party, although I can never vote for them because they will ban nuclear fusion research if they come into power, as they already tried in the early 00s.

All the smaller parties are either too small to matter or lunatics or both.

Not just Europeans in NATO and the EU, but Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, and Mexico. 

The US would be able to focus more on its noble efforts to defend the non-EU nations if the EU starting defending itself.

&gt; One of the great things was the American promise to protect it's allies.

And the EU would do the same for its own members.

&gt; More so, it also allowed for two-point combined American-European political approaches to international politics. You see that best in the game of Good Cop, Bad Cop (European diplomat explaining ""I can get you a good deal. But you'll need to agree these points. If you don't, maybe the USS Theodore Roosevelt sails with 500 miles of your capital""...

The only difference here would be the naming of the ship. ""I can get you a good deal. But you'll need to agree these points. If you don't, maybe the EUS Charlamagne sails with 500 miles of your capital""...

&gt;The US military being so large was also a major point in why other nations didn't build large militaries. Why build something if the best you could hope to build could never match what the US had at it's disposal. Better to not waste the money building that which would be easily outclassed and instead find a political solution long before conflict is possible. 

Which is why Europe has now found itself in a position where it is very vulnerable to US blackmail. It should never have allowed itself to become so reliant on an external power with dubious motives for something as fundamental as its own defence.

&gt; But the threat of force hanging out there didn't even often have to be made. Just the mere existence of the US Navy and it's ten aircraft carriers and nine Amphibious Assault ships that look suspiciously like slightly smaller aircraft carriers and each is larger than any Aircraft carrier used in WWII. This forces existence was and is very well known around the world. It's well known by design. 

And? Replacing 'US' with 'EU' there won't suddenly neuter the projection of power.

&gt;If the United States retreats into itself, the world is going get more dangerous for everyone. Very much including the United States.

\&gt;Implying the US hasn't helped make the world more dangerous itself

The war was fought to end Nazi Germany, who had brought a war of aggression onto Europe, and attempted to rule it under their dictatorial style of government. One of the main motivators for the allied citizenry, was the conviction that they were ridding the world of its greatest evil. That was only increased once evidence of Nazi crimes against “harmful peoples” was uncovered to the public. Knowing that you were helping prevent more victims of Nazism was a large propaganda factor for the allies. And there were many of those victims in the last weeks of the war. Which was my point. It silly to say that twelve weeks is nothing when talking about Nazi Germany. As for leadership, their motivation was to save the lives of their own soilders and end the war as quickly as possible, as it is in any war. Obviously that is within ethical bounds. But Dresden was completely within the rules of warfair at the time, so it was sound. 

 &gt;Still a shitty thing to do

Of course it was an awful, terrible, tragic thing. All things in war are. But the way people talk about it as a war crime, or as anything morally equivalent in any way, shape or form to the crimes of the axis powers, is just not sensible. Dresden, along with all other firebombing campaigns during the war, were an accepted part of warfair at the time. And that would still be the case even if the city was actually just trying to target civilian morale. But, again, the city was a legitimate strategic target as well. The city was one of the few mostly untouched industrial cities left in Germany, and was the main railroad transport for army groups Center and South now that they were pushed back (not to mention within Germany in general).

We all recognize firebombing is terrible. That is why the practise was made a war crime under today’s international regulations. If it is done today. But it’s just ridiculous to hold those in WW2 to the same standards. We didn’t even hold the Nazis themselves to the level. Again, no Nazi was ever prosecuted for bombing London. And that is because, even if the allies had never once firebombed any city anywhere, it still would have been unfounded to do so. Since we recognize that, at the time, it was an acceptable strategy of war.

It could allow the Treasury and the Bank of England to make changes to the EU’s Solvency 2 regulations, governing the amount of capital which must be maintained by insurers to guard against a crash. The measures were unduly harsh against British firms which have issued a lot of annuities – and Britain lost a battle in Brussels to address this.

I've heard this from more people who went to Rampage... So you're not the only one. 

**Does some others go to the festival solo?**  
There's a paper wristband for solo travelers so it's a common occurence. As you might've read, I went solo last year. If you have facebook you should join the Liquicity Festival 2018 facebook group and chat in there for a bit, more solo travelers do that. There's even a meetup scheduled on the friday or thursday before the festival iirc. 

**What are your advices (it might be ok to talk to people, i'm not really shy) ?**  
Advice: Enjoy yourself. Don't worry about the people. Just dance like you want to dance and be kind to people around you. You'll strike up a conversation in no time because people will be curious :) Enjoy yourself and you will appear open to others :) 

**What is the principal language talked into this festival ? Does a lot of persons talk english ?**

&gt;''The Left'' proposes policies that would alleviate the socioeconomic issues of the working class  
&gt;  
&gt;Lol when and where? The west stopped voting left because the left stopped caring about their voter base interests.

You're talking of neo-liberals, not the left wing in general, however I will absolutely agree with you that in Western Europe traditionally left wing parties have gone way too far to the right in their support for neo-liberal, lessez faire market policies, which I generally disagree with.

However, sorry, but at least in Eastern Europe ''leftist'' parties are not hated for their ignorance of the working class - since we actually support shit like Progressive taxation and Social welfare -  we've been demonised because the right wing sways people using shit like ''Liberasts'', ''Gayrope'' and other social conservative bullshit, which influences the working class just as much as it does ''white collar'' classes.

&gt;It’s as easy as that. But no you can’t accept that. “it can’t be because we the left did a poor job, we are the elite, we are perfect and god like creatures, saviours of the masses can’t be wrong. It must be because our adversaries cast a spell on all the people and their weak inferior minds got affected but ours didn’t”.

Sure, buddy, leftists are narcissistic demons and you're the snowflake victim.

&gt;But at the end of the day, if people don’t vote for you it’s because of your own shortcomings (being too caught up in identity politics, civil rights, and at the same time embracing globalism as a mantra and helping destroying workers rights revealing their actual disgust for the working class they view as inferior).  
&gt;  
&gt;until the Left doesn’t understand this the right wing populists will have a field day.

Yeah, sorry for fighting for civil rights, how dare we support minorities that are also a part of the working class.

I linked statistics later on. Most don't have any insight about LGBT situation in a foreign country yet you see the thread is filled.

If for no other reason than to differentiate it from the original. If the prequels did one thing right it was building a world that had a unique atmosphere from the OT. I feel like if that had been done, at least partially, for the ST it would fix a lot. The biggest one is why the First Order is a such a huge, well funded threat. The Empire was the reigning power. It was self explanatory. 

Personal unfulfilled wish but I think the First Order should’ve switched roles with the Resistance/Republic. The mirroring of the OT would still be there but from a new angle. The dynamic would immediately make so much more sense. The main problems with setting the stage go away.

It depends which people you ask. It's very split and it's unclear if it is the majority or not.
