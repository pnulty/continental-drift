I love the Star Wars lore much beyond that of the movies. Whereas with MCU and comics I never felt attachment towards it much outside of Spider-Man.

Star Wars to me is fascinating reason about the previous Sith Lords, the balance of the force, perspective of the light side, gray Jedi, and so on. I get the movies set the actual plot but what the EU did before Disney was remarkable.

No, I don't agree. Certainly in the last year this has been primarily framed around Britain leaving the EU and therefore being racist.

The total lack of comprehension of those people that almost every country in The EU is a worse place to be an ethnic minority than the UK doesn't mean they aren't attempting to make a relative comparison. They just don't know much or have a romanticised picture about these countries they claim to love.

During the two previous seasons Morata, Isco and James were there probably trying as hard they could in training in order to get more playing time which was pushing others as well.

Now there is not such quality depth, but then again when the likes of Kroos or Modrić are underperfoming why not give Dani Ceballos a chance? The times he's played I've heard he's done well. His brace even won a match for you guys in La Liga when everybody else were struggling. 

But yeah Benzema is the guy who plays a lot for Cristiano and doesn't score so much himself. Now when Cristiano isn't playing well either then the duo is suffering and it's no wonder that nobody up front is scoring the goals. 

Obviously it's easy to say it now, but Real Madrid should've gone all in for Mbappé in the summer. The guy is something else. The problem was apparently him not getting promised that he'd always be playing + other senior players having an issue with such a young guy getting paid so much..

dboeren,,,"&gt; I was thinking those were ribbon spools. I imagine having those be internal would also help with portability if one is clumsy...

Many machines with visible spools have covers for them, typically with some sort of friction-fit (whether around the perimeter or on a center post) so turning the machine upside down won't necessarily cause the spools to fall off.  However, the covers are sometimes lost over the years.


&gt; Do you know if the SM3 has the cursive font like the SM4?

It's on an individual basis, when you ordered/bought your typewriter you could choose from a catalog of different fonts offered for that model.  The most common were Pica (10 characters per inch) and Elite (12 characters per inch) both in a fairly normal serif style.  A machine with a cursive, italic, or other unusual font was probably a special order.  You could order machines with certain special characters too, for instance you might see a typewriter with special math keys, or foreign language letters.  Anyway, you'd need to look at that specific typewriter.  The sellers usually don't mention it or know to look for it.  You can sort of tell if there's a clear enough picture of the slugs, or you can ask them to type something and send a picture of the writing.  This both reveals the font and helps verify that it works enough to produce text.  However, if you tip them off that their machine has a rare font they might try to ask for more money :)

&gt; The Royal Quiet Deluxe's sure are cute!

I like them too, and the Royal Aristocrat is very similar.  I can see some people might find them ""boxy"" but I think they look pretty sharp.  I especially like the ones with the ""tombstone"" shaped keys

&gt; Can ask what styles or types you personally enjoy?

I've only been collecting a little while so my collection isn't that big yet.  I think my favorite is my Royal #10.  Very snappy typer and I love the glass windows on the sides.  I find myself drawn to interesting mechanisms, like how some of the Remingtons had gears on each type bar instead of doing it all with levers or their Noiseless typewriters.  I really like the look of the L.C. Smith #8 and in general a lot of the old open looking standards.  Olivers are really cool too, I have one but it's in pretty bad shape.  I generally don't like too much of the 60's and later stuff, 20s-40's seem to be my sweet spot.  I also don't mind the larger size and weight of standard machines (as opposed to portables).

Some things I'm on the lookout for are the L.C. Smith #8 (I really like the profile and openness of these), Underwood #5, Remington Portable #1, Woodstock #5, Remington #6, Royal Quiet Deluxe, Royal KMM, Smith Corona 3 (folding) and I'd like to pick up a couple European machines like the Olympia SM3/4, Optima, Hermes, and Olivetti.  I'd also love to get a nice Hammond Multiplex with multiple font elements but that's going to be tricky and costly.

&gt; This is so exciting!

I'm finding that the hunt is part of the fun.  Also, every typewriter has its own personality and cleaning up an old beater yourself and getting it working again for the first time in decades can be more fun than just buying something that is already in great shape.",True,0,1514779376,,False,0,ds0x9a5,False,t3_7mvfpm,t1_ds0r22u,/r/typewriters/comments/7mvfpm/what_do_you_use_your_typewriter_for_favorite/ds0x9a5/,1517443633,1,False,typewriters,t5_2s5on,public,

 I've read into this a little but it was for when the localization was done by the Treehouse with Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance for the GC back in 2005. Maybe the localization philosophies have changed from then, but they tried to be very faithful to the literal translation. When they couldn't be for one reason or another, they would contact Intelligent Systems and basically ask them ""when you say X thing, what are you trying to convey?"" They would then come up with ideas to capture that same idea and then ask IS if they could make the change. Down to everything like name changes they would consult if they wanted to change them to make sure they weren't ruining what the Dev team created.

If you disagree with the name changes, I'm not saying you can't feel that way.

Yes, many of the First Nations people I know like to be called by the name of their more immediate group... that is not the discussion here. The discussion is about the preferred name for the broader group.

They have **tremendous** power, but cannot interfere with free will, nor can they directly act unless it's in line with the will of another, or unless something darker makes a move first.

For an example, if a sith ghost of palpatine (It happened in the EU I think) were to show up and start influencing Kylo Ren, Yoda may be allowed to step in to balance it out and allow Kylo his free will.

If an army of force ghosts were to fight the battles of the resistance for the resistance, the resistance wouldn't have actually done anything. 

Take Obi-Wan for example. As a force ghost, he may have helped Luke guide those famous torpedoes into the Death Star, because he was acting in time with Luke's free will.

So Yoda was able to talk to Luke regarding the tree, and burn it, as Luke simply needed help expressing his own free will in that decision.

 ______ 
**The enduring legend of a Spanish dancer who became an Indian queen** 

 ______ 
In the first painting the woman is reclined on a sofa, an olive-green sari
wrapped snug across her body, her face framed by the hood of a pallu. In the
adjacent painting the same woman is crowned by a diadem, standing tall and
statuesque in a pale, low-cut dress. These portraits of Anita Delgado, one of
the city’s most famous natives, now hang in the Museo de Malaga, where Andres
Cabrera has suggested a stopover.

Before coming here this afternoon, Cabrera, 51, a city guide in Malaga, sighed
heavily as he narrated the beguiling story of Delgado, a poor Spanish flamenco
dancer who became an Indian royal in the first half of the 20th century. “The
Maharaja of Kapurthala saw her and fell in love with her,” said Cabrera, a
tall, bearded man pronouncing “maharaha” by interchanging the “j” and “h”,
Spanish-style. “Imagine, a simple of girl became a Maharani.”

Jagatjit Singh was an already-married 34-year-old king with a passion for all
things French when he visited Madrid for a royal wedding in 1906. Mesmerized
after watching a nightclub performance featuring the then 16-year-old Delgado,
he pursued her and had her educated in Paris and Brussels. They got married in
1907 and the following year he triumphantly returned to the small Punjabi
kingdom of Kapurthala with a new wife—his fifth and allegedly his favourite. A
Sikh ceremony followed and Anita Delgado became Maharani Prem Kaur.

She was suddenly thrust from an ordinary existence into an orbit of wealth,
power and status in an exotic foreign land. And as the captions alongside the
gallery’s portraits indicate, the good life included “jaunts to Europe” when
she commissioned “fashionable painters” to paint her.

Though it may be barely known or remembered in India, it’s a tale that inheres
in Malaga, a seaside Spanish town once ruled for centuries by the Arabs and
later conquered by Catholic kings. “At a time like that, a woman left and went
to another faraway country,” said Montse Ogalla, 52, a local filmmaker. With a
shudder of excitement, she added: “she was a woman, having an adventure!”

People like Ogalla heard the story by word of mouth, but over time it began to
recede. In the past two decades following half a dozen books, and the
possibility of a film, it has definitively moved from localized legend into
national attention.

_Passion India_, by Spanish writer Javier Moro, was published in 2005, a
historical fiction that mounted imagined dialogue on the bedrock of two years
of research. It tore up the charts. The tale contained everything: class
climbing, a Pygmalion-esque makeover, palace decadence, culture shock and
later rumours of infidelity. It practically wrote itself.

As a boy, Javier Moro recalled his grandmother remarking by way of shorthand,
that so and so was “wealthier than the Maharaja of Kapurthala”. “When they
talked about wealthy people they used to say [that],” he said, on the phone
from Madrid. “It was a Spanish saying, you see.” He didn’t think much of it
until he met a distant cousin of the Maharaja during a research trip to Bhopal
in the nineties. The ensuing conversation convinced him he had tapped a rich
narrative vein.

But after completing _Passion India_, Moro was all set to give up writing and
open a modern bakery. He had a growing family to support and bread offered the
possibility of a steadier income than books, given that he expected this one
to sell about 30,000 copies. It eventually went on to sell more than one and a
half million, was reprinted 50 times and translated into a dozen languages.
“So goodbye to my dream of becoming a baker,” he said. “I have to wait for my
next life.”

Still, he wasn’t the first to sink his fangs into this romantic drama. In 1998
the writer Elisa Vázquez de Gey had already published _Anita Delgado: Maharani
of Kapurthala_, an authorized biography drawing on a stash of private papers
and letters given by Delgado’s niece. Interest surged and following reader
questions she returned with two more books in 2005 and 2008. This year she
translated Delgado’s original French diaries into Spanish. The interest in the
dancer had become ever-green.

“The historical backdrops of her life fascinate the reader: the splendour of
the world of the Maharajas, Spain at the beginning of the 20th century, Paris
during the Belle Époque, both World Wars and the independence of India,” said
de Gey, who functions as the official preserver of her memory, by email. “You
have to imagine, she was a teenage girl from Andalusia, without much culture,
who within just a few months goes from dancing in a vaudeville act to
performing the functions of a princess in a far off country.”

For his part, Moro struggled to grasp why _Passion India _left women across
Europe swooning. “Listen, for me it’s a bit of a mystery and I was surprised
it was such a hit,” he said with disarming candour. He ventured a guess, all
the same. “I think basically it touches an archetype of the little girl who
has an opportunity to meet a prince,” he said. “I mean you know, who doesn’t
want to marry a prince?”

But as someone who has cultivated a body of work writing dramatized reality-
based accounts—including the controversial, Sonia Gandhi-centred _The Red
Sari_—that wasn’t all it was. “It was very unique to be able to tell the story
of the end of the Raj and of the last maharajas of India through the point of
view of a Spaniard,” he said.

He was one of the speakers at a day-long conference in Madrid in October
centred on Delgado, where her granddaughter also spoke. The 250-seater
auditorium was full to capacity and largely comprised women. “Somehow this
character fascinates women,” said Moro. “It has touched a chord in the female
psyche somewhere.”

The seminar was hosted by the women’s group Circulo Orellana as part of its
efforts to revisit trail-blazing Spanish women. “We try to organize such
programmes for the purpose of collective memory and to put their lives in
perspective, to recognize their work and their values,” said Leticid Espinosa
De Los Monteros,the Circle’s president. “It is not easy to go to another
place, another culture, another life,” she continued. “It requires courage.”

De Gey explored some of these dimensions, seeking to imbue her narrative with
an agency that popular memory had perhaps denied her. Delgado lived between
two religions, spoke five languages, travelled the world and even helped with
First World War efforts, by organizing winter wear for Kapurthala troops and
creating a relief fund for widows and orphans.

Everyone agrees her story was extraordinary, but dispute has dogged some of
the details. In Moro’s account she had an affair with one of her step-sons and
was banished to Europe to eke out the rest of her days. De Gey on the other
hand claims she carried out her duties as Rani “with serenity and discretion”
and “when the distance between her and her husband became insurmountable they
both decided that she would return to Europe”.

In any case, after 18 years in India, and having a son with the Maharaja,
Delgado moved back (there was no official divorce) and died in Madrid in 1962
where she is buried. Her son, Ajit Singh, arranged for royal emblems to be
placed on her tomb: a crown of a Sikh dagger and a crucifix.

Moro’s book evoked sharp reactions from one of the Maharaja’s descendants in
India—Tikka Shatrujit Singh threatened to sue him and said that the book had
presented a “scandalous portrayal”. A grand nephew of Delgado, Manuel Lucas
Sanchis, also wrote an open letter saying the book contained “a great number
of errors, frivolities and mediocrities intended only to provide a more
saleable image to the protagonist and her world”.

Delgado’s only son Ajit died in the 1980s, and Kim Akhtar, a daughter he
allegedly had through a brief affair, later returned with her own book, _The
Maharani’s Hidden Granddaughter_. (Despite repeated efforts, neither Singh nor
Akhtar could be reached for comment for this story.)

All the same, the legend of Delgado never quite caught on in India, as it did
elsewhere. “Well she was a minor character and spouse of a minor maharaja,”
said Moro.“Kapurthala was not a biggie.”

Abroad though, interest in the saga was triggered afresh when some of her
jewels were put up for auction in 2007 by Christie’s in the UK. Talks of a
film have continued to circulate in the ether. Rights for two of de Gey’s
three books have been sold. At one point Penelope Cruz held the rights to
_Passion India _and was to play Delgado. Now Shekhar Kapur has shown interest
in filming it as a mini-series, according to Moro.

Whether or not she is immortalized on screen, Delgado continues to animate the
Spanish imagination. One autumn evening a group of women from Malaga joined in

They aren't just trying to send a message to the US but to other countries as well, maybe signalling to some hardheaded and stuffy politicians that they need to reorient their foreign policy and work together to pick up the slack that we've left off.

As far as the European sphere goes, I wouldn't blame them for that assessment. We've basically stopped participating in world affairs that aren't related to ISIS and North Korea, the president has a negative view of the global economy and globalism as an idea, we're going to ignore the climate for at least four years, and it definitely seems like they're on their own as far as containing Russia goes.

As for proper -international banks- they tend to all do remote openings and everything is conducted online, which is amazing. BUT if you happen to be in the UK, most specifically London, anytime soon. It's always easier to start your relationship in person plus you save all the money from the documents attestation and courier fees which if is a few docs, will certainly be a few hundred dollars. Nothing beats face 2 face. Once you are in, absolutely all of it is online.

I've used Lloyds and Standard fee-less for years, so your dream is not impossible ;)

In Sing. not all banks require 50K unless my information is old, Citibank requires 200K and it used to be only 10K years ago, but those days are gone unfortunately.

Thailand is a jurisdiction where I wouldn't leave money parked, OK for small sums but =... too much turmoil, feels like currency controls are always around the corner.

The places in Asia I'm thinking are more remote, Federal territory of Labuan, Hong Kong, Macau? I'm willing to try even ""onshore"" Malaysia. Philippines is a nice place if you hold hard currencies. Their corrupt officials made it almost impossible to tell who owns the accounts.

African isles are... grey areas, in a sense the same as parts of the Caribbean, I believe Caribbean is better seen nowadays, but Seychelles or Mauritius are options. Yet I don't know how ""efficient/reliable"" their insurance will be.

You still have lots of options available even in Europe, in order of transparency or compliance perception, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Malta, Estonia, Andorra, San Marino, Lithuania, Cyprus, and the worse of the worse but super opaque, Montenegro, The country that is not supposed to use euros but does anyways. many of this jurisdictions usually require higher minimums than the scope of this conversation, but it's a good list to keep in mind. You will certainly not aim to do anything in Liechtenstein apart from stop by by for a nice hot chocolate.


All the banks we discussed, as a matter of fact, most if not all international banks, offer accounts and services in most currency usual suspects, USD/GBP/EUR/CHF/JPY. Lists are usually longer and many times include norther European currencies, if banking in Asia you usually get regional ones too.

I know there's a lot to go through, but do your research and and you will find what you want. Have you though about the Middle east? Most specifically Bahrain or UAE? They will offer services in the currency pairs you are looking for but without debit cards as other banks.


That should be enough for this installment. Let us know if there's been any development.

I don't think the Ottoman Empire ever had any major European allies but the French and Polish-Lithuanians. The Venetians had to maintain positive relations with the Turks (until their ports were eventually seized and Veneto was annexed by the Habsburgs), and the Neapolitans (as well as the Papal State) fought alongside the Turks in the mess that were the Italian Wars.

(One might argue that the British were in some sense allies (with respect to the Crimean War and Great Eastern Crisis), or perhaps for the case of the Triple Alliance, but both of these cases are far out of EU4s timeframe.)

The problem of Ottoman-Ming/Bohemian/Russian -ish alliances in EU4, is that it showcases a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of alliances -- alliances are chiefly formed due to strategic interests (and are thereby short-term ad hoc diplomatic relations), but I really wouldn't want Paradox to try to acommodate for that, considering that their own take on strategic interests [is absolutely retarded](https://imgur.com/a/X4hnF#Fb2QXiI)

Ah, and now you dug your own argumentations hole.

While using something (i.e. fossil fuel combustion) we only looked at the primary dangers. Is carbondioxid dangerous? And we concluded, well if you air your garage properly you have nothing to worry about. Only lately we realize that carbondioxide even tho without any immediate dangers carry weightful longtime dangers.

Now interestingly we *know* about the immediate dangers of radiactivity - and pretty much have no recourse how to handle them. The amount of contaminated soil in Fukushima that can't be 'disposed' for instance.

But we give literally *no regards* towards any longtime dangers. Just one harmless effect - low-background steel. We need that for a lot of things. And Chernobyl is a good case study too - I don't mean ground zero, I mean the rest of Europe. How the different 'less dangerous' isotopes accumulated in fungi, plants and animals.

&gt; Motion City Soundtrack was a pop-punk band which includes members Joshua Cain (guitar), Justin Pierre (vocals/guitar), Jesse Johnson (Moog), Matthew Taylor (bass), and Claudio Rivera (drums). Following their high-school graduation, Minneapolis, MN natives Pierre and Cain -- both of whom were inspired by Sunny Day Real Estate, Jawbox, the Flaming Lips, and Superchunk -- formed the band in 1999. The pair assembled a temporary lineup and issued a self-released 7"" that same year. Later, while touring through Pennsylvania in support of their release, Motion City Soundtrack met Thaxton and Taylor of the Virginia-based band Submerge. The two musicians decided to leave their hometown of Richmond, VA, to join Motion City Soundtrack full-time, and the expanded band soon entered the studio with producer/engineer Ed Rose (the Get Up Kids, Ultimate Fakebook). Three weeks before recording commenced, they were also joined by keyboardist Jesse Johnson (whose personal record label, Ordinary Records, had issued some of Jimmy Eat World's earliest material in 1995) to relieve singer/guitarist Pierre of his synthesizer duties.

&gt; With a new lineup firmly in place, the band's punk-glazed debut, I Am the Movie, was released in the summer of 2003. While playing venues and basements in support of the album, Motion City Soundtrack was picked up by Epitaph Records; later, they joined blink-182 on a tour through Europe and Japan. Blink's bassist, Mark Hoppus, took a liking to the band and agreed to produce their next album; the resulting Commit This to Memory was released two years later and featured an increasingly pop-heavy sound. A deluxe version of the album (complete with bonus DVD) appeared in 2006, and the band spent the summer on Warped Tour before heading to Europe with OK Go that fall. Entering the studio for the third time, Motion City Soundtrack began to work with producers Adam Schlesinger (of Fountains of Wayne), Eli Janney (of Girls Against Boys), and Ric Ocasek (of the Cars). The completed product, Even If It Kills Me, was released in September 2007.

&gt; On January 19, 2010, Motion City Soundtrack released a new full length album entitled ""My Dinosaur Life"". 

&gt; In June of 2012, Motion City Soundtrack released it's 5th full-length album  Go. The album takes the classic clever lyrics and upbeat MCS that we all know and love in a new direction. Editorial Review: ""Returning to their longtime label Epitaph to release Go, Motion City Soundtrack present the most mature and developed album of their long career. Continuing a dichotomy between upbeat music and darker lyricism that stretches back to their breakout single 'The Future Freaks Me Out,'  Go sees the band both maturing lyrically and musically while reinvigorating the signature melodic, keyboard driven sound that their longtime fans love. Despite the full circle musical evolution they ve undergone with Go, the band members agree that in some ways they feel like the same way they did when Motion City Soundtrack was starting to make their mark in the early 2000s (source below)."" Drummer Tony Thaxton left the band in March 2013 and was replaced by Claudio Rivera. Thaxton rejoined the band for their ""So Long, Farewell"" tour in 2016. Read more on Last.fm.

Derp53,,,"&gt; Denial in this aspect is complacent with his racism. 

I'm going to prove you wrong here. 

&gt; His city ghetto segregates both Dunmer and Argonians, and the saying is ""give Skyrim back to the Nords"".

The city was configured like that before Ulfric even inherited the throne from his father. Ulfric doesn't do anything for or against the Dunmer or Argonians. In fact if you actually spent any significant amount of time in the city you'd notice the Dunmer usually segregate themselves. The Nord population is pretty much laissez faire about the racial composition of their city. 

You could point to Rolff but that's one encounter and one person in a mostly Nord city. When you actually look at the reality of the situation, you see Altmer (even though they make up the leadership of the Dominion) as the stable owners and apothecaries (outside of the jarl's wizard which really makes the most accessible and only pharmacy for the common man) and Niranye as a general goods merchant right alongside other Nord merchants in the Stone Quarter. None of them ever get any abuse for being Altmer. Furthermore, if you ever go to Assemblage as a non-Argonian you'll find the Argonian residents outside of maybe the only female one there saying ""maybe this isn't the best place for you"" especially when you're a Dunmer. Why exactly would Ulfric let me mingle and possibly riot in his city when he's fighting a war against  a far larger powerhouse like the Empire? Lastly, as per saying Skyrim is for the Nords? That's a bullshit point, literally every Nord NPC is programmed to say it once they run out of other dialogue packages. One of the few exceptions to that rule is Ulfric and Galmar, they're not programmed to say that, they just reuse their existing dialogue. 

&gt; He ritualisticly rails against elves which is racist as the Thalmor are just one faction of one elven province his hatred and generalization is most certainly racist. If this is a hard concept just imagine any person in the real world and instead of saying ""drive ""PERSON"" out"" say ""drive the "" THAT PERSON'S RACE "" out"" you should notice the second statement is racist. 

Then you lack the ability to listen, because Ulfric says ""Thalmor"" and not ""Altmer"". The Thalmor are a political party and not every Altmer is part of it, some oppose it, some join it, some are apathetic a lot like Germans in the WWII and the SS (yes I know about Godwin's Law). He's saying drive the Thalmor out, not the Altmer, this isn't rocket science. 

&gt; To suggest that the empire is somehow more racist than the stormcloak movement is beyond solid reasoning, not a single city in Cyridil barred Khajiit this is a Skyrim policy that the imperials merely allowed to maintain control much like they allowed Morrowind slavery.

Don't strawman me, I said they were comparable and both flawed in that regard. But since you want to hold the Empire as some paragon of egalitarianism I'm going to give you some examples of how the Empire isn't all sunshine and roses in regards to race. First off, we're going to look at Skyrim exclusively, you ever talk to Tullius and hear something along the lines ""without the Empire Skyrim will revert to barbarism""? If you did and paid attention in English class in High School then you'll know that's more or less a rip off of the [White Man's Burden](https://www.shmoop.com/white-mans-burden/poem-text.html). That in of itself is damning, but keep in mind it applies to every other province under the Empire's rule because it is an EMPIRE. It exists to funnel resources and influence back into the motherland like every other empire. Second, have you noticed the way Legionnaires say the word Jarl when you ask them what the Empire is doing in Skyrim? Its said with a sneer, much like a British noble sneering at the concept of an Indian Raja appearing in court. That's not even touching on all the stuff from Oblivion, you want that too? Too bad, you're getting that too: 

http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Gerich_Senarel

http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Mach-Na

http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Arentus_Falvius

http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Isa_Raman

And that's just a few from Cyrodiil, you might cry ""but they're from the 3rd era!!"" And I'd say why would you expect any change from the population of a province that effectively colonizes its neighbors to exert dominance? Just look at Tullius' attitude and how he drains Haafingar for the war effort, its not all that different from how Churchill exploited India's farmland for grain to feed the British Army in Europe and Mesopotamia to point of causing a famine. 

&gt; Not a single city in Cyridil barred Khajiit this is a Skyrim policy that the imperials merely allowed to maintain control much like they allowed Morrowind slavery. 

That's irrelevant to the point, because the caravans aren't banned because of racism. They're banned because they smuggle illegal drugs in pretty much every part of Skyrim they go to regardless of whose banner that Hold flies. As for Morrowind, they could have stopped the slave trade once they acquired the Numidium but they didn't. Because it wasn't worth the effort required to backtrack on the deal to continue ignoring it. The Empire never gave a damn about the Khajiit and Argonians in its ranks unless there was something to gain. 

&gt; There was even a dark elf in charge of Cheddinhal wheras Skyrim is ran entirely by Nords.

Because Cyrodiil is a lot more diverse with a much different history than Skyrim? This comparison is retarded at best, because Cyrodiil is a melting pot due to its position in the continent. It borders every major province and habitually maintains hegemonic power over at least one of those neighbors. That's like pointing to [Flavius Stilicho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stilicho) and saying the Romans didn't consider themselves above the neighboring tribes and kingdoms. Skyrim is situated in arguably the northernmost point of Tamriel and has had two Nordic Empires before the foundation of the Alessian Dynasty. They're a culture that's very old and very established and the population (exception being Markarth) is majority Nord because of the geographical position of Skyrim and climate. Are you really telling me someone from Morrowind or Hammerfell is going to go to Skyrim when Cyrodiil is easier to get to, more metropolitan, and has a far more hospitable climate? Of course not, you're not that stupid (I hope), you're comparing apples to oranges when you say Cyrodiil has had a Dunmer ruler while Skyrim hasn't. And that's not even touching the bullshit [Katariah had to deal with due to her Dunmer ancestry](http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Katariah).

&gt; The Argonians were part of the empire per treaty

So is Morrowind, I'd recommend you learn what de jure and de facto are. They could have invaded Morrowind the day Titus Mede took the throne at the beginning of the fourth era and the Empire wouldn't have lifted a finger. 

&gt; It is because of this that Morrowind was able to purchase slaves obtained though the Argonian slave trade with no reprisal from Black Marsh because of the empire's interest in maintaining stability.

And yet you're going to sit here and tell me Ulfric is racist when there is no legal organized slavery in Skyrim to allow? Especially since the Nords have never actually really engaged in the slave trade in centuries where it was a staple in Dunmer lands for millenia? 

&gt; Once they left the empire they were able to retaliate with force to solidify the end of their subjugation when the Dunmer were at their most vulnerable Hist or no Hist the motive is clear.

I've said this before and I'll say it again, the Empire wouldn't have lifted a finger to stop the Argonians from invading Morrowind because they couldn't. By de jure the Argonians were subject to Imperial rule but by de facto they had the agency to do whatever they pleased. Following the interregnum pretty much all of Tamriel was able to do whatever it wanted due to the power vacuum. Furthermore, the Legions under Mede would never have been able to put down the Argonians. Tiber Septim himself couldn't do it and simply created a few forts so he could move on. If the great Tiber Septim himself couldn't do it I don't see how the Medes could, because frankly very few even deign to compare to Tiber. And those that do, Alessia, Reman I, Ysgramor, etc. are all legendary figures themselves or extremely good at doing what they do. The Medes have only been around for a century or two and have proven to be a mediocre dynasty at best.

The movies have left me undecided on them on whether or not I like them besides Rogue One.  The sequel trilogy has a lot of issues though, the worst offender to me has been the timing and pacing of them.  Along with those, besides Rey and Kylo, the rest of the new characters haven't made much of an impression on me and I really don't feel invested or care about them.  I also disagree with some of the retreading of the OT and decisions for the OT character's stories not adding up to much accomplished.  Rogue One I really enjoyed, and I felt it would've fit just fine in the old EU since the Death Plans were already split up into pieces there.

The novels, as someone who owns over 110 Star Wars novels from the old EU and has read almost everything released from back then, have been very disappointing.  They're so inconsequential now.  Disney is afraid to let anything big happen outside of the movies so that the larger audience doesn't miss it, that nothing much really happens in them anymore.  We get smaller character driven stories, no more big events like the Thrawn trilogy or a moon killing Chewbacca.  I read the I guess first batch of them up to Bloodlines, and then nothing else has seemed interesting enough for me to even bother with.  I wish we would see the old EU brought back, revive the Sword of the Jedi trilogy, but I know it won't happen.

The comics are about the same as the novels except gotta add bad art in the main Star Wars series as an issue.  I just read all the old EU comics starting from Dawn of the Jedi to Legacy II at the beginning of the year, followed by the new Marvel ones up to Luke going to the planet with the blue rock giant.  Dark Horse did it better, all of it.  They did Vader better in their 4 Vader series and definitely in Purge which is one of my favorites.  The time after Yavin between IV and V was covered very well in Rebellion, Empire, and the just Star Wars titled comics, and Marvel's main series even borrows some from these.  Finally the original Clone Wars comics were amazing.

I do enjoy Rebels and The Clone Wars animated series.  TCW was better and I hope in this last season of Rebels we can see some TCW level stories and seriousness from the show.

The longer Disney Canon goes on the more it pushes me back towards the old EU.

Natural rights are not grounded in Christianity. Christians of the same period died of easily treatable diseases and lived like pigs as well, you are correct. Part of that is because they had kings, popes, slavery, and no respect for individual rights.

Libertarianism is about the future my friend, it is an ideology which will allow us to live together in peace and prosperity. Yes, a ton of progress toward it was achieved in the 18th century, but it's an ongoing project.

We should preserve even more land, but most of America is pretty empty anyway, so there isn't much of a rush to preserve.  And I don't think it's subjective to say we have excellent national parks.  I've travelled Europe and lived in the Czech Republic for years and my experience there was 1) European parks are more like our smaller suburban ""forests,"" every path is well-worn and the chances of seeing large, wild animals are thin - none, 2) Violent crime was just not a thing there.  No street pollution, no neighbors having parties all night, no boom boxes, only saw graffiti a few times, almost a non-existent murder rate - none of the serial killer stuff we have here.  American newspapers are filled with murder and violent domestic and child abuse and rape and attempted murder/armed robbery stories every single day - that stuff just did not happen in the Czech Republic.  I reject the notion that the issue is the system and not crime.

&gt; Vanguard ist keine Genossenschaft, sondern eine Gruppe von Investmentfonds, die alle Anteile an der Kapitalanlagegesellschaft aufgekauft haben, die sie verwaltet.
&gt;
&gt; Dies wäre in Deutschland illegal und wurde auch von der Bafin ausdrücklich verboten:
&gt;
&gt;* Das Prinzip der Trennung zwischen KAG und Fondsvermögen wird so aufgehoben und die Trennung in KAG-Vermögen und Sondervermögen aufgeweicht
&gt;* Da in den Fondsanteilen der Wert der KAG enthalten ist, entstehen dem Anleger Verluste, wenn die KAG pleite geht.
&gt;* Abhängig von dem Ausgang noch nicht geführter Gerichtsverfahren könnte das Fondsvermögen bei einer KAG-Pleite voll für die Verbindlichkeiten der KAG haftbar gemacht werden, was zu einem Totalverlust für die Anleger führen könnte.
&gt;* Wenn Fondsanteilen zurückgegeben werden und das verwaltete Vermögen sinkt, verliert die KAG automatisch Eigenkapital und muss schrumpfen. Der Anteil des Vermögens, der in die KAG investiert sein darf, ist nämlich vertraglich begrenzt. Schafft die KAG es nicht, schnell genug zu schrumpfen, wird sie automatisch insolvent. Besitzt irgend ein einzelner Anteilsinhaber so viele Anteile, dass er mit der Rückgabe aller seiner Anteile die KAG unter die festgelegte Grenze *zwingen* kann, kann er die KAG quasi auf Knopfdruck in die Insolvenz schicken
&gt;  
&gt; Diese Risiken erklären zum Teil die geringeren Gebühren.
&gt;
&gt; Eine weitere Tatsache ist, dass Vanguard Ableger auf anderen Kontinenten besitzt (z.B. Vanguard Europe), die Fonds unter der Vanguard-Marke vertreiben, die im Gegensatz zu den US-Fonds aber selbst keine von Anteile von Vanguard besitzen. Die Gebühren sind bei diesen Nicht-US-Vanguard Fonds marktüblich, was zu zusätzlichen Gewinnen bei Vanguard führt.

Aber wie gesagt, in Europa haben wir dieses Risiko nicht, weil KAG und Fondsvermögen komplett getrennt sind; dafür aber etwas höhere Kosten als in den USA.

AnaSyn, is a strategy to collapse the capitalist production, thrugh direct action and the uniting all workers in a federation of Unions. It's about uniting proletariat, not, separation of it. 

You could argue that if all the workers aren't part of the union it would fragment the workers in different classes, something we saw with the Soviet system. To that, we could argue that the system of administrating the working space should not be an union, but a co-op, where all othe workers are oweners of the means of productions, and the union has a role of support, education and agitation (see the examples of cooperatibes in Northen Kurdistan).

You can also see this example in Europe, where for you have Coperativa Integran de Catalunya, which has the role of a union in the theorical example I give before. They have no power in the co-ops, and their members' role and responsability is supporting the creation of alternative workspaces. In many cases, these Co-ops or organizations, were born from organizing unions in work spaces, that at some point decided to constitute a co-op with thes support of CIC.

Despite the aforementioned, he was still vastly very unpopular and unknown quantity. To the majority of trance community, I'd say 2016 was a semi-breakout year as he started shying away from Monster onto the bigger labels.  Notable releases including ""Until We Collide on Subculture"", ""Nevada on FSOE, which made the 450 compilation"", ""Poseidon on Outburst"", ""Gold Rush on Mental Asylum"" to name a few really brought him in the spotlight. Huge part of this recognition perhaps to him completely evolving his sound from the euphoric and melodic to a much darker and emotive spectrum suited perfectly for clubs and festivals. Laying the platform for the gigantic rise in 2017 with more subsequent releases on additional labels like debuting on Kearnage and Pure Trance. As well as the widespread recognition and praise from JOC hailing him ""the most talented artist he ever worked with"". And to add to all that, making debut tours to Aus, NA for Dreamstate and Toronto, when he wasn't even touring outside Europe before (bear in mind German trance scene is incredibly slow too).

Depends what you think the goal behind it is.  The corporate part which was left out of that link basically will give an incentive for companies to bring their money stashed overseas back here.  The flood out of europe/asia will not be good for them.  

Big companies don't pay any corporate tax as it is, but this will help the small business sector, which is where most job growth is anyway.

Then the personal restructuring is rip some of the loopholes out for those states that have high housing costs and high tax costs.  Currently, deductions subsidize high real estate values, because bankers take into account the tax deduction when valuing a property.   Take that away, and the idea is prices will reflect market value better.

Residents in states with high taxes might reconsider living there with these big deductions taken away.  The goal is to get those to states to lower taxes, reduce government expenditures, and stimulate the economy.  That's the theory anyway.

WikiTextBot,,,"**Banlieue**

In France, a banlieue (French: [bɑ̃ljø]) is a suburb of a large city. Banlieues are divided into autonomous administrative entities and do not constitute part of the city proper. For instance, 80% of the inhabitants of the Paris area live outside the city of Paris. Like the city centre, suburbs may be rich, middle-class or poor—Versailles, Le Vésinet, Maisons-Laffitte and Neuilly-sur-Seine are affluent banlieues of Paris, while Clichy-sous-Bois, Bondy and Corbeil-Essonnes are less so.

**Immigration to France**

France received immigrants in successive waves during the 19th and 20th centuries. They were sometimes rapidly assimilated into French culture when European successive post-war governments wanted to promote immigration and so promoted the notion of France as an inclusive nation with universal values stemming from the French Enlightenment.

In 2008, the French national institute of statistics INSEE, which has a more restrictive definition of immigration than Eurostat, estimated that 5.3 million foreign-born immigrants and 6.5 million direct descendants of immigrants (born in France with at least one immigrant parent) lived in France representing a total of 11.8 million and 19% of the total population in metropolitan France (62.1 million in 2008). Among them, about 5.5 million are of European origin, 4 million of Maghrebi (either Arab-Berber) origin, 1 million of Sub-saharan African origin and 400,000 of Turkish origin.

&gt; Spain&amp;#039;s Economy Minister Luis de Guindos has put the cost of the Catalan independence crisis at around &amp;euro;1bn. He told Spanish radio that it was due to the slowdown in the Catalan economy after the unauthorised independence referendum on 1 October.

&gt; The separatists are best placed to form a new administration, with separatist groups winning 70 of 135 seats in parliament.

&gt; Mr de Guindos urged the separatists to abandon the &amp;quot;Unilateral way&amp;quot; and focus on the &amp;quot;Basic necessities&amp;quot; of Catalan society.

The country sides are more isolated so you're more likely to hear it there I think.

So you're going to lose a bit of performance by going with a Ryzen 1600 instead of something like an i5 8600k on a 1080p 144hz panel. But by going with the cheaper Ryzen chip i was able to fit in a 1070ti (when overclocked it performs similar to a 1080), RGB water cooler and NZXT's Hue+ (RGB controller + Strips). All that in the p400s with a temperd glass side panel is going to look pretty badass imo.

Edit: I don't think the 1070ti Titanium comes with a backplate, so you might want to get a nice custom one made for it.

MNGrrl,,,"&gt;  if they don’t share more user data *to fight terrorism*


It works just as well for all the reasons our civil liberties should be shit on: bullying, hate speech, child abuse, *-ism, and more. Tech companies are right to ignore these demands. Unfortunately, tech companies are flat wrong in how they're using that data now. Monetization and marketing aren't the moral high ground. Turning customers into products isn't something to be lauded. 


The truth is, the reason these things don't gain traction is because the EU and most of its member states throughout Europe aren't anymore interested in these other problems than getting their own slice of the cake. They want control over Facebook and Google because they can make money off of it. They know they can't stop or even make a dent in the problem because there are terabytes of text-based conversation happening every day. We'd have to hire half the population to police the other half. And if that sounds familiar, it should: It's what East Germany was doing right up until the Berlin Wall was toppled. That's the future of the internet: A wall between the economically developed first world, and a despotic third world.


And it will be justified by saying it's for ""terrorism"" or whatever. This demand is about as emotionally mature as Trump claiming he's going to build a concrete wall along the US/Mexican border. It's pursuing a social policy that's counter to its own goal: It won't stop immigration. If anything the false sense of security will make it easier in the long run. The maintenance costs, which will take away funding from boots on the ground, and an over-reliance on cameras, will all but destroy border integrity.

Eu não achei ruim, mas desde que a série passou a ser produzida pelo Netflix (3a temporada), ela perdeu um pouco do rumo e a visão original.

Meu problema com a 3a temporada foi que boa parte dos episódios focaram mais em ação e aventura do que as temporadas passadas.

Já a última temporada, além de ser a mais “positiva” de todas (o que necessariamente não é algo ruim), focou demais no aspecto sci-fi ao invés do social, e reusou o mesmo artifício (mentes humans rodando em máquinas) em literalmente metade dos episódios.

Might be NSFW

Before HRT i had no need/wanting to have sex whit anyone, due to sex was gross for me. Other than that my sexuality was lets say: Weird...

Like guys were repulsive/&amp; gross and only thing i liked about guys was their dicks(and it was only set of genitalia i had neutral/good feelings towards).

When it came to women i finded them asthetically really pleasing but their genitalia grossed me out.

Perfect partner/my better half would had been either a asexual cis woman or nonop trans woman(and i wouldn't mind her being asexual).

So my sexuality(attractions) was:

*  Physical(no genitalia) attraction towards female bodied people, maybe androgynous guys
* Mental:Basically anyone, male or female
* Genitalia: I only felt attraction towards penises. Would had been okay whit a person who had vagina but was asexual. I were really asexual, not wanting to have sex whit anyone


Now being on hormones(and let me tell you hormones are weird, atleast for me in mental effects sense...):

Suddenly guys stopped being repulsive&amp;gross(like physically i find guys neutral now, okay but usually still not as asthetically pleasing as women(in general, no matter their body type).... Weird since this change happened just in first and second week of HRT....

Also HRT made my phatom breasts dissapear(replaced whit actual breasts) and gave me phantom vagina(i feel like there is another set of genitalia behind my male genitalia????)

When it comes to women i have mostly same feelings, but i dont tend to see women as ""hot?"" anymore(aside maybe like certain types, eg latinos(not objectifing them due to their ethnics) for some reason i am attracted(most) to both latino guys and girls, mostly girls, probably due to me being from Northern Europe where all guys and girls are same white fairly blondes?)(despite being asexual)???
Like now a hot/cute guy beats a normal(where i am from most women look like shorter super models..., so normal is subjective) woman for me now...

Then there is whole new aspect: Sexual attraction... I never really realized it excisted or was normal(?), but now(since being on hrt for few weeks) a cute guy really turns me sexually on... Its weird as (insert curse word).... And now i have a weird need to have a vaginal(PIV) sex whit a guy(or PIV whit a cute trans guy), despite me not having these sort of genitals and probably never being able to have sex whit guys if i ever got vagina upgrade, due to me being really ridicously small(1 inch flacid, 2 inches when hard?) in that department....


So recap, now after being on HRT(and having come off of it for few days due to limited(6 day supply for 8 days, it used to be like 9 day supply for 19 days...) supply the sexual changes have not dissapeared???? WTH??? I tought when my body started running mostly on T again and no E(1mg of e for like 3 days, i used to have 2-3mg E per day...) it would like reverse the mental changes but nope!?

Actual recap:

* Physical(no genitalia): Into both women and men now, a normal woman beats uglier guy, but a cute guy beats a normal woman... WTH?
* Mental: Same like it used to be, basically anyone male or female
* Genitalia: I still exclusevly like the D, still am okayish whit preop(but on T and bottom growth) transguy genitalia. Still not attracted one bit to normal vaginas(not saying that trans guys have vaginas)...

* Sexual attraction/sexual pull(as in rubber band): Brand new, and for guys. I for some weird reason feel now sexually pulled towards guys.... A really weird change.... Before HRT i never had anything like that....


Weird thing is that all the sexual changes seem to be from HRT, since i had fully accepted myself(even sexually, i had some exceptions towards guys which were only mental, like for them being really helpful towards me???) for 2 whole years before i got on HRT... And only thing that seems to trigger these sexual changes was HRT... Literally nothing else/new going on my live 2 months ago....

* In **Brotherhood** space, weddings are Big, raucous affairs with dancing, food and more then a little lewd humor. Everyone you know is likely to show up and just as likely to bring people you've never met. The separation between Ceremonial and reception is all but nonexistent where the entirety of the formal part taking place about an hour in where very loose vows are exchanged followed but a blessing by the officiant authority as well as a blessing from a member of family and a close friend for each person getting married. If one of the poeple involved in planing is particularly organized, there might be two parties, One public affair and a second ""Crew"" party slightly off to the side. Given the sheer size of gathering expected and the cost of feeding basicly three times as many people as you invite, Multi weddings are fairly common. In fact before the Official part is finished the officiant might call out ""Before we depart back to the festivities, Be there any more Lovers who wish to pair under these fair stars?"" when any couple (Or more) might suddenly choose to get married then and there.

The Party part is basically your standard keger. No formal dress is expect for anyone, but women often do make a point to look nice and the bride will often spend days if not weeks into preparing to look her finest. Likewise, the groom will often put some effort into matching his lady. *this is of course talking about the original couple, moochers will wear what they wear*. The only truly traditional part of the thing is that at some point, someone WILL put on ""Tubthumping by Chumbawamba"" and when it does, the whole party will stop to sing along.

Where it will take place depends on your place in society. If your a land lover, you will most likely have it at your family home. If your a spacer, then it will likely be on the ship you serve most likely the mess hall. If you're a captain, I will also be on ship but the party will be vastly expanded to basically the whole ship. And if your an admiral, the whole fleet is expected to join up in one heck of a party with the "".

* In the **GTE (Grand Terrian Empire)** most wedding based off the Western European Wedding with the white dress and suits. It's a fairly formal affair with groomsmen and brides maids. There is a distinctly separated wedding ceremony followed by a reception that often takes place at a separated location.

Other than that, a most weddings will very widely as cultures mix and fashions go in and out of style.

* **Stingyons** doing really have weddings so much as breeding contracts. They bred through eggs after all and so the Male and Female might never directly meet. Inviting anyone but those absolutely necessary to the final meeting would be met with looks of confusion over the fuss. If the ""groom"" is satisfied with everything agreed upon, He might not even show up, letting it fall to his parents and the lawyers. After everything has been finalized there might be a party but nothing more then what a business man might throw for having made a big sale to a client.

When it's time for him to fulfill his part of the breeding process, he might met with the female and they will ""dust"" his genetic material onto the egg together or he might send his genetic material to her or even to a third party nursery for them to do everything. once the child hatches and makes it's infantile pouch, it will be sent to him for him to carry for about a year until it's the equivalent of a human toddler.

Many breeding pairs will chose to go through this process together but a number see no point or choice but to do it in this deeply impersonal fashion.

- The **Exor* do not have weddings. All of those interested in continuing their genetic line make a donation to a public Reproduction center where The material is examined and matched with opposite material. When a child has been successfully produced the parents are contacted.

w3woody,northcarolina text,"Glendale, CA -&gt; Raleigh, NC","In fact, like all redevelopment districts everywhere (even in the US), French ZUS areas have a large number of impoverished individuals--and sadly (even as your video points out) unemployment rates amongst muslim immigrants is in the 40% range, while unemployment for the rest tends to be in the 5%-6% range. (At the 9:15 mark in your video.)

So it's not hard to have a poor area, and see poor immigrants migrating to those poor areas. (You see the same thing happen in the United States.) And once those poor immigrants locate to an area, they bring their culture--which in Europe, means Muslims, including some folks who think a Caliphate may be better than their current circumstances, and a few folks who think Sharia Law would be an improvement. (Again, you see this in the United States; remember President Obama's ""clinging to their guns and bibles"" comment?)

But it's a matter of cause and effect. Thinking they are ZUSes because they're full of Muslim immigrants is ass-backwards; those zones were impoverished and problematic long before the civil war in Syria fueled the current wave of immigrants. 

The real problem is Europe's relative failure to help immigrants integrate into their societies (because European Nations tend to be a single people with a single set of beliefs occupying a territory and having a government). This have made the situation worse. 

(This is in contrast to the United States, where we handle immigrant integration far better--because we were not founded as a single people and a single culture, but as a multi-cultural society pretty much from the start. And because we expect full self-sufficiency by immigrants pretty much from day one, including obtaining a job and paying for one's own housing. We provide less public aid to immigrants in the United States, but in contrast we have no problems with immigrant communities--and even see them as tourist spots, such as the various Little Chinas around the country.)

----

In short: poverty increases crime. Muslims immigrating to Europe tend to be poor. To conclude Muslims cause crime is a logical fallacy; at best it's a [post-hoc fallacy](http://onegoodmove.org/fallacy/posthoc.htm). But it is an understandable error--and both ends of the political spectrum in the United States engage in post-hoc fallacies all the fucking time.

Please, do not take my understanding as a defense. My comment about confirmation bias was to point out that the fact that a large American audience who think there are Muslims wanting to push Sharia law in no-go zones in Europe is not some sort of conspiracy theory to shove an agenda, as your remarks imply.

It's just mass stupidity.

And mass stupidity not dissimilar to what we see on Reddit All. The. Fucking. Time.

Roland_Traveler,,,"Mine was a recent Savoy game. After forming Italy, the midgame slowed down as a Bohemian-French-Ottoman axis dominated Europe. It even beat up me and Austria once, but it turned around after I got rich off of trade and went fishing for allies. After fortifying the Alps and swapping out my infantry for mercs (didn't have CoC at this point) and allying England and Ireland (who were allies, surprisingly, despite Ireland owning Scotland), the tables stabilized. I also ate Naples, who broke away from Spain, around this time for extra luck. Then I got England in a PU out of nowhere in the 1660s. And France went Revolutionary and lost most of its big allies (I had already won a couple of rounds against them, though), letting me and my Norman march take twice as much territory. Then I got a Spanish PU in the 1720s. By this time the New World was my subject's subjects, French cannon fodder, a rogue California, and some allied Portuguese colonies, so I dominated the New World. I got so strong I could beat up Rev France with its starting borders minus Paris, Emperor Blobhemia, and the Ottomans at once by my self (plus PUs, but my troops got so good that they disintegrated most armies that weren't twice their size. Italian ideas + very army idea except Aristocratic + Protestant buffs is OP). Then I bought CoC, Rights of Man, and Cossacks and my armies, even those that were half merc, became even more deadly. By this point the only thing I had to worry about was my Irish ally fucking up in Asia and refusing to ask for help. I had to declare two wars to fix their mistakes. But not for long, I got a PU over them too and retook all their land. By the end of the game I had eaten France and gave its northern parts to Normandy and Brittany to Britain, controlled the entirety of the British Isles through PUs, had Iberia split between my PU and a docile ally, resurgent, and allied, Austria and Brandenburg dominating the HRE, and had reclaimed the Straights for Christendom. I had even more luck, because Malta left Spain at one point, allowing me to immediately scoop them up. Then, while I had them in a PU, they lost Sardinia and Sicily, which I immediately ate before they could get allies. The only three unlucky things in this run were having to save-scum to get Milan in a PU (eventually gave up and simply beat the shit out of them and turned them back into a monarchy when the went republic, then got them), the dominating block in the mid game, and Austria breaking our alliance to fight a succession war over Spain(?) because we were both Hapsburgs. I simply had to pay them off and things went back to normal.  All in all, it was a really lucky endgame that ended with Italy solidly in the first place amongst the Great Powers.",True,0,1514849027,,False,0,ds20dij,False,t3_7ndjhc,t3_7ndjhc,/r/eu4/comments/7ndjhc/best_streak_of_luck_you_ever_had_in_a_game/ds20dij/,1517473183,1,False,eu4,t5_2uqat,public,

Youth competitions have **always** been meaningless. Hell, *international* youth competitions are meaningless. People don't care about the *Olympic* tournament despite it being, you know, the Olympics.

The UEFA U21s and U19s, and the U20 World Cup, are all played in the off-season for this reason - because no club in Europe would ever release a first-team player, and neither UEFA nor FIFA would ever require them to.

&gt;  Playing against the best opposition in the continent is going to do more for their development than 4 a league games.

A handful of games against kids from weak footballing nations is going to do absolutely nothing for their development either.

It's belittling and irritating, it makes us fucking hate you.

Fun Fact: the only time that NATO's stipulation has been called, you know the one that says 'if any one of the member nations is attacked we'll all go to their defence' was when those terrorists you created threw a couple planes at you. Big old strong America needed little baby Western Europe's help then to invade a country in order to find a guy who was actually next door in a country you think you control.

Then all your other propaganda leaks over here - 'oh land of the free, home of the brave' accompanied by your films and TV which take the piss out of the rest of us (other than the nationalism, your film industry makes some good stuff, not denying that). Then all our fucking kids start adopting your American crap with Proms and fucking Thanksgiving now for some fucking reason.

I'm not denying that any other country of the world hasn't done some dodgy shit in their past. Western European countries have done some really fucked up things. But, you've existed as a country, as a union for 240 years. You're a baby compared to the rest of the world... yet you've have done more in those 240 years than most of these ancient countries have EVER done. Nearly every single one of your 45 Presidents have done some fucked up shit in office. You were the country that stopped slavery after everyone else.

You do some really evil shit to win and I don't think that's an overstatement. And it's not like it's just your government. You're the ultimate liberal democracy, I thought that means the government is supported by the people and can ONLY exist under their support. You support this shit that goes on. Every fucking American who doesn't say shit about it and just chants 'USA! USA! USA!' when we call you out is responsible.

Thephalanx23,,,"&gt;Sorry, Unlike Turks who have collective little dick syndrome and a deep rooted sense of inferiority, Greeks in large part do not derive their self worth from their countries, or what their Ancestors did or didn't do. Irrelevant rants of a pathetic sad Turk.

LOL

Do you even believe what you're saying? Your inferiority  complex towards Turks became a large part of your culture. You're on the same level as Armenians.

&gt;Also LOL talking as if your Empire was great, the Ottomans were the shittest Empire possibly in Existence. The Byzantine Empire and Alexanders Empires were far greater and had a much greater, lasting cultural impact.

Doesn't change the fact that Byzantine Empire was pathetic and we King Kong smashed your empire. Besides Byzantine empire was not ""great"" in any way. Literally everyone at some point defeated your meme empire. Arabs, Bulgarians, Venetians, Turks etc. No one liked it.

&gt;And you were kicked out of Epirus, Attica, the Peloponnese, the Aegean, Crete, and Macedonia by low IQ stupid Greeks ..thanks for the Islands KOMSHU

Uh Uh. Egyptians and Turks crushed your meme uprising. When they were about to put an end to your LARPing, The French/British and Russians showed up and saved you. You owe your independence to them. Which makes your country even more pathetic.

&gt;Lol didn't realize we had two

Empire of Trebziond and Byzantine Empire. I know they're too pathetic to be called Empire but you called them empire. 

&gt;unless you are on some ""we wuz khans"" Bullshit, and referring to some steepe Asian you have no relation too, cause you're an islamfied Greek.

Are you trying to discuss genetics with me? Because i'm pretty good at wrecking people in genetic arguments. And no. We're not Islamized Greeks. Rather, we're descendants of the Turkmens who wrecked your pathetic meme empire and the Anatolians who were hellenized by your inferior kind. Anatolians were building empires when you were living in mud huts by the way.

Proofs

https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-15-963

&gt;The weights for the migration events predicted to originate from the East Asian branch into current-day Turkey was 0.217

&gt;We show that the genetic variation of the contemporary Turkish population clusters with South European populations, as expected, but also shows signatures of relatively recent contribution from ancestral East Asian populations.

and here a study (kinda outdated though) which says
http://etd.lib.metu.edu.tr/upload/12607764/index.pdf

&gt;Moreover, results pointed out that language in Anatolia might not have been replaced by the elites, but by a large group of people. Therefore, it can be concluded that the observations do not support the elite dominance model of Renfrew (1987 ; 1991).

If you want to discuss genetics with me, feel free to do so. Because this is my hobby.

Oh and get that ""islamized greek"" out of your mind. Because ethnically we're closer to Northern Caucasians, Persians and Azerbaijanis than to your kind. Besides. What's Greek ethnicity? A lot of Greeks are hellenized Pontians, Armenians, Slavs, Albanians, Levantines etc etc. You're American tier. As far as i remember to be considered Greek you had to be ""Orthodox"" according to 1827 Greek law.

hellotheremiss,,social realism,"In a span of a month, I finished the Europe series (Europe in Autumn, Europe at Midnight, Europe in Winter) by Dave Hutchinson. It's an alt-history, near-future sci-fi about a Europe that has fragmented into various small nation-states. There isn't much technology in it. It's more about conspiracies and clandestine organizations. It's very well-written. The first book is my favorite among the three. The second one is okay, and the third wraps everything together. Its greatest strength in my opinion is the main character, Rudi. He's immensely likeable. 

Some issues I had with the series: the use of fake identities and names makes you lose touch of who is really who, who is working for what organization. There's also the numerous characters that just are shoved at you 'in the thick of things'. It's fine but you get this sense of disorientation for a while, since it takes a moment for things to click, or the narrative to connect somewhere in the main story. For a sci-fi, there isn't that much technology in it that can be deemed cool. The main technologies aren't really delved into that much, so you just have to take a lot of it in faith, that is, it's more fantastic than speculative-scientific.

* JC and TM to remain in place, so long as TM survives the upcoming cabinet reshuffle (likely) and JC remains in good health (very likely)

* Slow but steady Brexit progress, end up more or less maintaining the current status quo, but with little say on any rules, a huge bill and implementation of checks that existed before or were negotiated by David Cameron before the ref. No second Brexit ref.

* Polls remain broadly the same. Tory's drop a few points over the year, but remain within 5-8 percentage points of Labour. LD stay pretty dead, maybe gaining a couple (2-3) points. UKIP gain a few (~5) points as Brexit continues to unravel.

* Labour generally win local elections and by-elections by a greater-than-expected margin.

* Tony Blair's efforts over the past year or two start to materialise. Possible that a new centrist party emerges, with TB influencing and supporting out in the shadows, but being careful that the new party isn't associated with him.

* Public services go past breaking point. The public gets increasingly frustrated. Some large-scale protests occur, but little change in both polling and policies.

* Macron and Merkel work together without the UK to strengthen the EU, bringing it closer with even more shared laws and governance.

* Russian tensions increase, escalating to near-cold-war levels. Some sanctions occur, but little has effect.

* Trump either kicks the bucket or is impeached towards the end of the year. Beyond repealing a few bills like Obamacare and annoying Kim, achieves practically nothing. Republicans continue in power until 2020.

* Prince Phillip's health declines. Dies early to mid 2019. The Queen soldiers on.

&amp;nbsp;

As a member of the 29th Infantry Division, I would like to invite you to consider our Charlie Company.

&amp;nbsp;
     
The 29th ID, a tactical realism unit, was established in 2005 by Captain Timothy C. Wilson. In this unit we use a modified American World War Two rank structure, but in-game we operate in a modern way with modern-day tactics. We strive to achieve our victory by using tactics as real and modern as the game currently allows. In the 29th Infantry Division, we are looking for dedicated, mature soldiers willing to put time and effort in advancing their skills with weapons, teamwork, and tactics. Not only for themselves, but also for the unit. We train and fight in both TvT and COOP scenarios with focus on squad and platoon tactics and communications, while at the same time **offering both NA and EU-friendly times.**

mars_rovinator,,,"I shouldn't have to spell this out for you, but I will, because you seem to be fully indoctrinated to believe that you should take everything someone says to the most literal conclusion possible.

This is silly. It's a sign of poor critical thinking skill. Instead, think about what I might mean.

Some people aspire to realistic, achievable goals - like learning how to weld, or becoming a mechanic, or developing computer software.

Many millennials, however - and yes, this is **very** specific to the millennial generation, myself included (I was born in '84) - aspire to unrealistic and impossible goals, like becoming instantly famous or studying medieval German literature and believing a career can be found in such a ludicrously specialized field. They think that life is just like what they see on television, because the explosion in online streaming has caused people to really detach from reality as much as they possibly can.

When you have unrealistic expectations of adult life, you generally also have unrealistic goals for yourself. A goal of ""I'm going to be a millionaire by the time I'm 30"" is unrealistic for most people. It takes well above average intelligence to achieve such a goal, so the statistical majority of the population simply can't achieve such a goal. A goal of ""I'm going to travel Europe for a year after college"" is equally unrealistic for the vast majority of the population. Such a goal requires a **lot** of money, unless you plan on illegally working while abroad.

Even worse, because millennials have been taught that you are objectively stupid and intellectually inferior if you don't go to college, many of them have gotten degrees when their skills would simply be much better suited to trade or vocational work.

My own immediate age demographic - those of us born in the mid to late 80s - was the start of this forced social change. Public schools on the west coast were already teaching the idea that you're objectively inferior if you don't go to college.

That part I *was* insulated from, due to my parents' decision to not send me to public school. I did, however, attend public university.

In high school, I was certainly surrounded with the belief that you should go to college if you want to do anything with your life - that was more due to most of my classmates coming from wealthy, upper-middle-class families. I wasn't surrounded with that kind of ideology at home. I spent my senior year living in the hood, surrounded by mostly working-class, blue-collar families.

Fact is, not everyone should go to college. There are **lots** of people in America who have no real use for higher education, and are much better suited to blue collar work. Instead, because of the doctrine of self, which includes the ""follow your dreams"" mantra, kids who are suited for middle class skilled labor are going to college, majoring in fuck all because they have no higher ed aspirations to begin with, and end up deep in debt with a useless degree and a **completely unrealistic worldview**.

Reality hits hard and fast, and now millions of millennials are still living with their parents into their late 20s and early 30s, completely incapable of fending for themselves.

It's great to follow your dreams, but it's selfish, careless, and dangerous to follow your dreams before you've established self-sufficiency. That takes hard fuckin' work, and if you don't want to put in that effort, then no, you don't deserve to follow your dreams. You deserve to wallow in the mediocrity you've created for yourself, because I sure as hell don't want to finance your lazy ass's fantastical dreams about how life *should* be.

I'm living my dream. I work at the one place I've wanted to work since I was in the single digits, I have a huge property and a beautiful house, I have lots of cash in the bank, I'm married to a wonderful person who can read my mind, and my life is really, really awesome.

You know what, though? It took nearly nine years of blood, sweat, tears, lots of sleepless nights, and some pretty horrible things happening to me before I got to this point.

Millennials believe they're entitled to have right out of college what I have right now. THAT'S why following your dreams is such a dangerous ideology.",True,0,1514859437,,1514860853,0,ds28pj3,False,t3_7nei9i,t1_ds25n5z,/r/CringeAnarchy/comments/7nei9i/this_is_child_abuse/ds28pj3/,1517477309,6,False,CringeAnarchy,t5_35j1r,public,

scrooched_moose,,,"The more I think about this movie, the more I'm convinced Disney just couldn't figure out how to handle rebooting the Star Wars universe and we were left with this weird, inconsistent mess. 

Looking at Episodes 7&amp;8 as a Battlestar Galactica 78/04 style reboot they are pretty good. They derive inspiration from the original trilogy, and share names, concepts, and style but are their own thing. In this fictional rebooted universe, I don't really care we don't know what happened to the New Republic (or whatever it got called after Legends canon was nuked), why Rey is so powerful (because The Force works a little different now), where Snoke came from, or a hundred other little issues. 

What we got instead is this ""soft reboot"", where it's supposedly a direct continuation but they broke...everything. Hyperspace as a weapon, Rey mastering The Force without a bit of training, and Force Ghosts physically impacting the real world retroactively ruin the rest of the canon. It would be like learning in the next Bourne movie that can fly like Superman. No matter how good that story may be, the first thought is ""well, why didn't he use that to escape all of the other situations?"". 

I'm sure there will be EU corrections to patch up this broken continuity eventually but it'll never be good or satisfying. Granted this has always an issue with Star Wars (parsecs?) but I'm much more willing to forgive it in a low budget scifi film written by one man than a multi billion dollar franchise with a [dedicated team](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Lucasfilm_Story_Group) who's sole job is to ensure consistency. 

It seems to be the way to approach this new universe is the OT and PT still happened in a broad sense - key events still occurred and the Jedi are a group of great warriors, but any specific details we learned should be forgotten.

thoth2,,,"&gt; As was always inevitable. That doesn't change the fact that institutions and norms put in place by us are not enormously-successful in crafting the world in a way amenable to us, or that the Chinese haven't learned this lesson (one that seems to have escaped you).

But there will always be certain global norms. Prior to the US-led international order, the global norms were Spheres of Influence of different global powers. Prior to that, it was the Westphalian system and colonialism. Every era has its own norms. We are coming to the point where there will be multipolarity of norms: American-led Bretton Woods or Chinese-led institutions like AIIB and OBOR. My point is that the Chinese won't implement these by force or through coercion as there is no precedence for that on their end. Furthermore, choice is fundamentally a good thing. Countries having different development options is a good thing.

&gt; There is no Chinese model, per se; they will not want to make everyone else mercantilist. There is merely the deconstruction of western norms and other irritations to the ruling party's hold on power, which is where the danger lies.

Define deconstruction. Because so far Chinese trade deals do not involve preconditions such as democracy or any of that crap. It's been strictly business. China hasn't tried to stifle these institutions outside of its own borders. They create their own institutions, but they don't force any others to abandon their own and join Chinese institutions. Yes, Chinese dealings in Africa have been extractive and resource-driven but they don't try to destroy the norms and institutions of African countries.

&gt; There is only one side deriving benefits at little cost.

If that were true, then Europe would be looking to stay with America. But the only country that wants to do that is the UK. Continental Europe realizes that it needs to chart its own independent way if it wants to be relevant on the world stage. I think Europeans will eventually reach a point where they set up their own lasting European institutions away from the US as well as China. This can only be beneficial for both sides: America can do its own thing while Europe can simply chart a route for itself.

I don't see what the issue is exactly. You say Europe doesn't contribute anything to the US and that the US would be better off without them. Yet when they look towards Russia and China, you have an issue with it.

Ewannnn,,,"X-Post from UKPol

**Article text:**

In 2018 the real Brexit negotiations begin. The phase one political agreement between the UK and EU — on financial obligations, rights of expatriate people and Ireland — was a preamble. Concluding a formal treaty governing the UK’s withdrawal in March 2019 is the central task. This should establish the agreements of phase one, and many other separation-related issues, in detailed legal texts between the UK and the European Commission, which must be approved by a large majority of member states, and the British and European parliaments, before the exit date.

This will require intensive negotiation between the UK and the EU. It will also involve other governments since the withdrawal treaty will need to address Britain’s future position in agreements between the EU and other countries. We cannot assume that these will roll forward on current terms, and changes could trigger a wider ratification process in parliaments across Europe and beyond.

If the spectre of a cliff-edge Brexit is to be avoided, the withdrawal treaty should be accompanied next year by a political framework setting parameters for the UK’s future relationship with the EU. This represents a dramatic scaling back of the earlier, unrealistic British ambition to negotiate these future terms in full before March 2019 — a highly significant, if little publicised, outcome of December’s Brussels summit.

There will be two main strands in negotiations about the future: the economic relationship and the wider political relationship, including defence, security and foreign affairs. To reach the framework stage, the British government will soon have to make hard choices about the sort of Brexit it wants, notably on links to the single market and customs union, and acknowledge the limits of what is possible. The EU will negotiate, but will not change its own rules to meet British demands. At home, both the withdrawal treaty and the framework agreement will face intense parliamentary scrutiny through the year and in the final “meaningful” vote.

Because of the scale and complexity of what lies ahead, 2018 will kick off with talks on the terms of a transition period, intended to provide as much political and economic stability as possible after the UK legally leaves the EU in March 2019. The European Commission will argue that transition should end in December 2020 to match its budget cycle. The British government will probably argue for a period of two years, while trying privately to persuade its pro-Brexit faction to keep this open ended. As the deadline approaches, both sides will discover more time is required.

The transition, originally billed as a period for bedding in already agreed arrangements between the UK and the EU, has now morphed into the period in which the detail of those arrangements will be negotiated. Unless they can be agreed and implemented in parallel, this means yet a further implementation period will be needed. On even the most optimistic assumption, the process of scoping, negotiation, ratification and implementation of the new relationship will take a minimum of five years from 2018.

Another purpose of transition is to assure businesses that their operating environment will not be dramatically disrupted. But it is now clear that the longer-term trade and regulatory environment will not be defined for some years, and the commission argues that, even if a political agreement on transition is reached early in 2018, there will be no legal certainty until the UK’s withdrawal treaty is formally ratified.

It is now clear that the longer-term trade and regulatory environment will not be defined for some years

We should expect more turbulence over the year ahead. There will be political strains within the British government. Germany needs a new coalition. The agenda is vast.

We do not yet know what sort of deals on withdrawal and future partnership British ministers will bring to parliament towards the end of the year. As things stand, the best we can hope for is a reasonably ordered formal exit in March 2019, followed by a continuing negotiation as an outside country on the details of our future relationship lasting several years during which we will still be bound by EU rules but have no say in future EU decisions.

By late 2018, we should have a clearer picture of options for the future. We cannot predict how this knowledge will influence public opinion, especially if the British economy shows further signs of stress. If the mood shifts, it will be late, but not yet too late, to change our mind on the whole Brexit project. Meanwhile, this prolonged uncertainty argues for keeping open the option, however difficult, for both the UK and the EU, of trying to delay our formal departure by extending or suspending the Article 50 process beyond March 2019. Once we had left in haste, any repentance would certainly be at leisure.

bhosk,,,"The alliance is building up its presence on its eastern front, but the practical problems are formidable

 When the last US Abrams battle tanks left Germany in 2013, it marked the end of a 69-year presence, and told of a western military alliance untroubled by potential problems on Europe’s borders. Just a few years later American armour is again fanning out across the continent’s east with a mission not just to show strength to an emboldened Russia, but to test whether the mundane matter of logistics might hobble Nato’s response to any provocative action.

The scores of US fighting vehicles that in September rolled on to the docks in Gdansk in Poland were the latest to join an urgent effort to test the obstacles to rapid Nato deployment in Europe.

Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea tops a list of security worries that have brought the “peace dividend” era after the fall of the Berlin Wall to an abrupt end. General Robert Neller, the US marine corps commandant, warned US troops stationed in Norway late last month that he felt “there’s a war coming”. His spokesperson later said the general did not believe a battle imminent, but was stressing the need “to be ready for the full spectrum of conflict”.

Just a week earlier, a senior Russian official had accused Nato of forcing Moscow against its will into “military competition in the centre of Europe”.

“After the wall came down . . . it didn’t even occur to anybody that we would have to be moving across eastern Europe in any kind of military formation,” says General Ben Hodges, until recently commander of the US Army Europe. “We all thought Russia was going to be our partner. Everybody started downsizing their military as fast as they could.”

Now, a senior Nato official says the alliance is “looking at all those things we forgot how to do”. He admits the pact — or at least some of its members — could have been quicker to heed warnings from events such as a wide-ranging cyber attack in Estonia in 2007 and the brief Russia-Georgia war in 2008. “All of the indicators were there,” he says. “We took our eye off the ball.”

Others in Nato dispute that it has been too slow to adjust to big changes in the international security environment. But officials in both the alliance’s sprawling Brussels headquarters and the capitals of its 29 member states agree that there is an urgent need to sharpen operations in Europe. Both Nato and the EU have launched multi-pronged initiatives to address logistics concerns from easing transport bottlenecks to reforming time-consuming border customs procedures. 

The military overhaul in Europe is providing a new test of Nato’s capacity for reinvention, nearly 70 years after it was founded. The alliance is now trying to demonstrate its ability to protect a post-cold war frontier that stretches from the Arctic Circle to northern Syria. 

The challenges facing Nato range from the capabilities of cash-strapped European militaries, to the commitment of President Donald Trump’s US administration and the intentions of President Vladimir Putin’s Russia. Nato also faces questions about whether its scaled-up territorial security is proportionate — or risks provoking the very kind of conflict it is supposed to prevent. 

“Nato certainly doesn’t want a new cold war, [but] the world has changed and therefore Nato has to change,” says Jens Stoltenberg, the pact’s secretary-general, who took over less than a year after the Crimea conflict began. “For the first time in our history, we need to do crisis management beyond our borders and at the same time step up . . . our efforts for collective defence in Europe.”

The process has intensified since Mr Trump took office. The US leader shocked Nato allies in May when he failed to reiterate American support for the pact’s Article 5 provision, under which members commit to each other’s mutual defence. Since then, he and other US officials have made more reassuring statements but he has also urged, even more directly than previous US administrations, European members to spend more on defence. He claimed in November that this pressure had yielded results: “Billions and billions of dollars are pouring in,” he said. “Nato, believe me, is very happy with Donald Trump and what I did.”

European countries, who make up the overwhelming majority of Nato members, have signalled that they are taking common security more seriously. All but three of the EU’s 28 member states last month launched the so-called Permanent Structured Cooperation (Pesco) to boost defence co-operation.

A Dutch-led initiative to improve military mobility around Europe, looking at obstacles from red tape to inadequate infrastructure, has been approved under Pesco. It is intended to dovetail with a report on the same subject due from the EU’s European Defence Agency in the spring. Halbe Zijlstra, Dutch foreign minister, has said the military mobility work “should enable the EU to better ensure our own security”.

The flurry of activity reflects the scale of the rethink on the defence of Europe since the Crimea conflict began. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 Nato redirected its operations into international conflicts such as Afghanistan and more recently Libya. US army personnel in Europe fell to just a tenth of its postwar peak of about 300,000, as Washington’s focus shifted to Afghanistan, Iraq and the rise of China.

Now the Nato alliance has set up what it styles a deterrent air, land and sea presence in its eastern member states.

There is a “tripwire” first line of defence of about 4,500 Nato troops in forward bases in Poland and the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Since 2015, a US armoured brigade of about 3,300 personnel has been based on rotation in Europe.

The relatively small size of the alliance’s eastern resources inevitably leads to the question of what would happen if Russia, or another power, decided to test Nato’s strength. Russian troops could be on the outskirts of Tallinn, Estonia’s capital, within 60 hours of an attack starting, a study by the Rand Corporation claimed in 2016. Nato says a “spearhead” reinforcement contingent of 5,000 troops could start deploying anywhere in Europe “within days”. This year the spearhead force will be led by Italy, whose capital Rome is more than 2,000km from Tallinn.

The logistical problems run deeper than distance. In central and eastern Europe, where many countries were either in the Soviet Union or part of its Warsaw Pact, infrastructure is sometimes sparse or dilapidated. Bridges, tunnels, roads, railways and ports in western Europe have not been constructed in the past 25 years to carry large numbers of heavy US military vehicles. “They are no longer building bridges in Europe with a 70-tonne capacity capable of supporting the weight of an Abrams tank,” observes Doug Lute, former US permanent representative to Nato.

The quantity and variety of glitches is intimidating: a six-hour delay to shipments crossing between Poland and Lithuania due to a change in rail gauge; the obstacles military vehicles face clearing the many Polish railway stations that have only one siding (Warsaw says most stations have more than one); the limitations of Bremerhaven, a German North Sea port, where access is via a single road gate that allows only a total of 1,500 vehicles per day in and out.

The investment the EU and Nato make in improving and reviving infrastructure will ultimately be a “political decision”, says Michael Linick, a contributor to the Rand report. “The more aggressive their posture towards Russia, the more necessary this is.”",True,0,1514879509,,False,0,ds2lnja,True,t3_7nkzy1,t3_7nkzy1,/r/ukpolitics/comments/7nkzy1/natos_logistical_battle_to_deter_russia/ds2lnja/,1517483631,9,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,public,

&gt; No Use for a Name (often abbreviated NUFAN) was a punk rock band from San Jose, California. They were formed in 1987 by Tony Sly and Rory Koff. The band is highly praised in the skate punk and hardcore scenes, though their sound has evolved considerably through the years, taking on a much lighter and poppier brand of melodic punk.

&gt; NUFAN's debut album, Incognito, was released in 1990 through New Red Archives. The band has released a single and one more full-length on this label, until signing up with Fat Mike's label, Fat Wreck Chords, on 1993. At that year, No Use For a Name released its first record on Fat, The Daily Grind, which turned to be a highly successful album.

&gt; In 1995, After the release of Leche Con Carne, their fourth full-length, Chris Shiflett (now in the Foo Fighters and Me First and the Gimme Gimmes) and Matt Riddle (also in Pulley) joined the band to play Guitar and Bass, respectively. In 1997, after the success of Making Friends, the band went on a worldwide tour through U.S., Europe, Australia, Canada, and Japan.

&gt; Chris left the band to play in the Foo Fighters, so now they have Dave Nassie playing guitar

&gt; The band released their 8th full-length album, titled Keep Them Confused, on June 14th, 2005. It takes a more political, philosophical and religious position than earlier releases.

&gt; A greatest hits collection titled All the Best Songs was released on July 10, 2007.

&gt; A new fourteen song full-length studio album entitled The Feel Good Record of the Year was released on April 1, 2008. In 2009, when promoting the album in Europe, Dave Nassie left the band to join the ranks of Bleeding Through. In August 2009 the band announced, that they replaced Nassie with Lagwagon's guitarist and founding member of RKL, Chris Rest.

&gt; In December of 2010, Rory Koff announced to the band he would need time off from touring to go full time with his snowplow business and eventually was replaced by new full-time drummer Boz Rivera (of King City, RKL, and The Mad Caddies.). Koff was the last remaining member of the original 1987 No Use for a Name line up.

&gt; Since 2010, No Use for a Name has been working on a new album.
Tony Sly tragically passed away on August 1, 2012. Read more on Last.fm.

mysunandst4rs,,,"Let me clarify, Indian communities will definitely accept and welcome you if you’re Indian at all (albeit identifiable - white looking American Indians may face some challenges, just how it is). Tribal/Intertribal communities don’t outwardly discriminate on blood quantum because nobody knows how much you are unless you tell them honestly.

Tribes in the U.S. have enrollment. This stems from the Dawes Rolls from the Dawes Act or the Indian Allotment Act where the federal government broke up reservations in an effort to separate families and communities. Each head of household was allotted a set amount of land. 

Tribes are seen as sovereign entities to the government. We have our own tribal governments, tribal elections, services, etc. Part of our sovereignty is deciding who is a part of the tribe (for enrollment purposes) by blood quantum requirements. Some have 1/4 blood, an 1/8 blood, or simply if you can prove your ancestors were on the Dawes Rolls some tribes will accept that. So when you’re enrolled in a tribe you have access to their services such as health clinics, education grants, assistance, etc. This came from the Indian Reorganization Act where the US government decided tribes needed to have governments modeled after European governments as opposed to chiefs or sachems and the like.

Many, many people, especially in the state of Oklahoma, identify as multiple tribes. Such as I’m tribe A, tribe B and tribe C, but I’m only enrolled as tribe C. Tribes typically have a rule that you can only be enrolled in one tribe.

A few Indians go to the UK and (let's pretend Indians have a poor grasp of English and don't understand people explaining that they're not Chinese) and start referring to the Brits as ""Chinese.""

Then all of a sudden, a bunch of Indians come on ships and rape the shit out of the UK, destroy half the country, replace it with their version of a civilization they start calling ""superior"" and now 2 billion Indians live in the UK and have also dubbed themselves to be ""Chinese"" because ""they built the country.""

Eventually they realize they're in the UK and not China and start calling the place the UK instead.

Then imagine you're a Chinese person (from China) that goes and lives in the UK. Of course the Indians treat you like shit for no reason and can hardly differentiate you with the Japanese, whose imperialism was horrible for you and attacked the living fuck out of your country and while you don't think they're bad people, you think it's dumb you guys are lumped together politically and socially. 

So you're British-Chinese. Except that doesn't make any sense because that term is referring to the white British that were originally called Chinese by the Indians. So what do you call yourself?

This is a completely different matter and we weren't discussing about this, so I won't bother answering to that.

&gt; You know why they moved their headquarters? Because they want to be sure they won't be left out if someone decides to, i dunno, declare independence overnight over a sham result of an illegal referendum.

Then explain why exactly zero foreign companies decided to move HQs. Some companies (namely Seat) even denounced pressures by the Spanish government to move HQs. Come on, it's pretty obvious that this whole move is just a play to make it seem like an independent Catalonia is not viable economically. 

And sham result of a referendum? Sorry? The elections two weeks ago got more pro-independence votes than the referendum (without even counting Catalunya en Comú which has a percentage of pro-independence votes), how can you justify that? The referendum was perfectly valid and the incidences were minimal and did not affect the result at all.

&gt; You may not know this but if we split, we won't have access to the EU free market, on which a lot of companies depend on;

Nobody can really know what will happen with certainty. However the fact that many companies have said that they are not worried about a Catalan republic, and the fact that Catalonia is growing very fast economically leads me to believe that this will not be a problem and that the EU will agree to some kind of deal to keep the Catalan market (they won't risk giving such a gift to other world powers like China or Russia).

&gt;In conclusion, it is inconceivable that any EU exporter would wish for any disruption in their trade with the UK on Brexit. And it is almost certain that the key EU governments, not least of all the German government, would act in their economic interests.

The first sentence is a given, but the second is not.  Germany doesn't have to act in it's best economic interests if political interests are higher - see the UK exiting Europe for details on such an idea.

&gt;The UK has a strong hand in any trade negotiations in the interim period between a Brexit vote, the triggering of Article 50 and Brexit itself. Not merely would our major EU trading partners wish for a trade agreement, but they would also be likely to push for such an agreement to be finalised expeditiously, prior to the UK’s departure. 

Again a given, the states of Europe would all like a deal as fast as possible, but she couldn't/didn't foresee how long it would take to get to the stage we are at.

&gt;It would simply not be in their commercial interests to prolong the negotiations. And, given that the UK would be negotiating as a fully harmonised EU member, this should not be impossible.

Catalonia is not as important a *gift* (wow) as the UK, and the EU couldn't care less about them now. They're on their own and probably will be made an example of. There is no deal to be made.

PLanPLan,,,"*The close connections between ‘remain’ campaigns, their donors and suppliers*


As Britain Stronger in Europe approached its spending limit in the final weeks of the referendum
period, many other campaigns were established which spent significant sums to campaign to
remain in the EU. Five campaigns which only registered as permitted participants in the final month
of the referendum period received a total of £1,001,000 in donations.


Adam and Eve registered as a permitted participant on 25 May 2016 as an independent campaign
as DDB UK Ltd, less than a month before the referendum. DDB UK Ltd received £191,000 in
donations.

Best For Our Future registered as a permitted participant on 27 May 2016, less than a month
before the referendum. It received £424,000 in donations

Proud Robinson Ltd registered as a permitted participant as The In Crowd on 10 June 2016, less
than two weeks before the referendum. It received £76,000 in donations.

Virgin Management Ltd registered as a permitted participant on 3 June 2016, less than three
weeks before the referendum. It received £210,000 in donations.

Wake Up And Vote registered as a permitted participant on 24 May 2016, less than a month before
the referendum. It received £100,000 in donations.


Although the legislation places no limits on the number of permitted participants that may be
registered on each side, it is reasonable to infer in all the circumstances that some of these
campaigns were established for the purpose of evading the statutory scheme for the control of
campaign expenditure in PPERA 2000. Of particular interest is DDB UK Ltd. Its registered address
was the same as Adam and Eve’s and its responsible person was Adam and Eve’s Chief Executive
James Murphy. Britain Stronger in Europe spent £7,467.60 with Adam and Eve on 1 June 2016,
while Wake Up And Vote spent £24,000 on Adam and Eve on 28 June.


Further evidence from which an inference may be drawn of common plan expenditure is the use of
common suppliers by the various ‘remain’ campaigns. M&amp;C Saatchi acted as a supplier to both
Britain Stronger in Europe, which spent £57,600 on the advertising agency, and Conservatives IN
which spent £4,029.81. The In Crowd spent £34,375.20 on Build Hollywood Ltd, whilst We Are
Europe spent £54,000 on the same company. Freud Communications offered its services to The In
Crowd at a cost of £64,431.78, and to We Are Europe for £30,000. In addition, Goodstuff
Communications acted as a supplier to both The In Crowd, which spent £55,215 on the agency,
and We Are Europe which spent £6,000.

Of the five apparently independent campaigns which registered in the month before polling day,
85% of the donations they received came from persons who had already donated to other ‘remain’
campaigns, as the table below shows:




Lord Sainsbury’s role in particular merits close examination. He donated £2,915,734 to Britain
Stronger in Europe. In addition, he donated £815,000 to campaigns which registered in the month
before the referendum.


It appears that Lord Sainsbury had an active role in the management of these campaigns, as well
as financing them. His first donation to Best For Our Future of £50,000 took place on 24 May 2016,
three days before it registered as a permitted participant, suggesting he was instrumental in its
establishment. Sir Craig Oliver admits at page 77 of his memoir having meetings in early February
2016 at Great North Street ‘which is where David Sainsbury has some offices’ to coordinate the
Government’s research and communications activity with Britain Stronger in Europe’s. Given the
 sensitive nature of discussions between the Government (which at that time had no formal position
on EU membership) and a major ‘remain’ campaign, it is reasonable to infer that Lord Sainsbury
was closely acquainted with sensitive details of campaign strategy given his offices were used for a
meeting of this kind.


The close connections between the various ‘remain’ campaigners, their suppliers and donors
outlined above suggest that it is reasonable to infer that there may have been communications or
other coordination between them about who would incur referendum expenses and on what,
especially in the period when the lead campaigner, Britain Stronger in Europe approached its
spending limit. It is very unlikely that these close connections were the product of coincidence or
happenstance. The connections appears to be further evidence from which it may be inferred that
(i) Britain Stronger in Europe exceeded its spending limit contrary to section 118(2) of PPERA
2000, and (ii) it and other campaigns gave false spending returns, contrary to section 122(4) of
PPERA 2000.


*Conclusion*


The Commission may investigate a complaint pursuant to its Enforcement Policy where it has a
reasonable suspicion an offence has been committed and where it is in the public interest to
investigate. The evidence in support of this complaint plainly gives rise (at the very least) to a
reasonable suspicion that contraventions of PPERA 2000 have occurred. Given the scale of these
apparent contraventions, the public interest in ensuring that referendums are conducted fairly and
in accordance with the law, and the high profile nature of the 2016 referendum in particular, it
seems that it is plainly in the public interest that the Commission investigates this complaint.


I would be grateful if you would acknowledge receipt of this complaint by return and look forward to
the outcome of your assessment.

MinTamor,,,"&gt; Seems like a terrific waste.

Well, look at it this way. 

At the moment, British taxpayers have to pay officials at the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work in Bilbao, the European Environment Agency in Copenhagen, the European Food Safety Authority in Parma, and more than 30 other similar EU agencies. 

Most of these replicate functions already performed by British regulators such as the Food Standards Agency and HSE. Isn't that duplication not a bit wasteful in itself? 

Moreover, let's assume that the EU agencies take some of the workload off the British ones, who will have to hire more staff post-Brexit. 

These are reasonably solid, well-paying jobs that could be given to British workers in deprived areas of Britain. They will pay their taxes here, and buy things from British shops, and support local businesses. What they cost the taxpayer is not money that is flying out of the window. 

Whereas paying EU officials in Parma and Bilbao to do the same thing is, in fact, money that flies out of Britain and never comes back. Particularly as EU agencies have a [poor record] (https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmselect/cmfaff/219/219.pdf) in hiring British workers. 

&gt; Integrated supply chains are a fact of life, are they unpatriotic?

Old news and already discussed in Italy since the summer of 2015,** few months after the beginning of the yemeni conlfict between the shiite Houthi militias and the forces of the Arab League lead by Riad.

**Thousands of airplane bombs (including inert training copies) produced by the factory of RWM of Domusnavas, in Sulcis** (currently in phase of expansions thanks to the investments of Rheinmetall for 40 millions of euros), **have been sold to the saudi air forces that are consuming them intensevly** in a war that [the leadership] in Riad delude themselves thinking that it would end quickly and almost painlessly and that instead risks to transform itself in the “saudi’s Vietnam”. 

**Indeed, after just 5 months of war the saudi fighter-bombers Typhonn and Tornado had already exhausted their supply of guided bombs and in the august of 2015 the british Royal Air Force gave to the Royal Saudi Air Force their stock of Paveway IV (bombs like the ones produced by RWM to which has been applied the laser/gps guidance kit made by the american Raytheon).**

**A concession that risked to leave without bombs the british jets deployed in the fight against the islamic state in Iraq and Syria but that couldn’t be refused to a golden ally such as the saudis that in Great Britain had bought a large part of their aircarft fleet, the fighetrs-bombers Tornado and Typhoon made by european consortia that Italy is also part of.**

**“We aren’t directely partecipating in the saudi operations in Yemen but we are giving technincal support, precision bombs and information exchanges with the saudi forces in base of the previous accords” had explained the 14 of july 2015 the minister of defence answering to an interrogation by the House of Commons.**

Cheapo-Git,,I'll have Hard Boiled Eggs and Gherkins with it.,"&gt; But we have an absolutely gargantuan trade deficit with the EU

And?  We have a massive trade deficit with China, too.

With the EU, it's only in Goods, anyway.  In services, the largest sector of our economy, we have a surplus with the EU.


Having that trade deficit with the EU is far better than having it with countries that have an almost slave workforce, at least the EU are on a similar level when trading products that we also produce here, since it lets our domestic industries (which are likely to have a higher production cost than many non-EU nations) trade their goods here and the EU on a relatively level playing field.

The EU are our closest and largest trade neighbours, and have similar values and economy type and a shared history, and it's a massive market, that's just 50 miles away, or an hour on the train and is a single market.

A lot of that trade deficit is food. And we can't be *totally* domestically self sufficient, so if we trade unlimited zero tariff food goods with non-eu countries that have enormous factory farms or those that pay their workers next to nothing, it would kill our agricultural industries, many are already barely scraping through with all the Subsidies they get.

But having a reasonable amount of sufficiency in food is important, because you don't need to worry so much about environmental or conflict issues around the world, and also when trading with other nations if all your agriculture has disappeared, they won't have you in a throat hold knowing you're relying on them just for your food.

Other sectors we still have may also be priced out of existence at, akin to when having Chinese imports pretty much ended many of the the majority of factories we had here that built TVs, VCRs, Radios (other electronics) and many of other household goods and utensils.


&gt; in fact we have a trade surplus with Non-EU countries

Are we going to make a deal with 'The World outside the EU'?

The band experienced the usual member changes for a new band, as Denner left (and later returned). In addition, the drummer position was a revolving door, but Kim Ruzz finally established himself as the drummer.

&gt; Several demos and live shows survive from 1981, including their infamous first concert ""Sabbath of all witches"" held in early/mid 1981.

&gt; In early 1982, the band contributed to the Ebony Records sampler Metallic Storm. Later on in the year, Mercyful Fate recorded its first official release, Mercyful Fate, on vinyl for the Dutch label Rave On. The release included heavy and evil material that would later inspire the black metal genre (although Venom and Bathory are as equally considered as the forefathers of black metal).

&gt; Following the EP, the band released Melissa in 1983 and Don't Break the Oath in 1984, which are now considered by many to be classics in both the power metal and black metal genres. Following the tour (which saw them play in the United States for the first time) in support of Don't Break the Oath, Diamond split ways with Mercyful Fate in April 1985 as a result of frustration over creative differences with Hank Shermann. With him, Diamond brought band mates Hansen and Denner to found a new band under his own name. Diamond's new venture continued the tradition of Mercyful Fate, but with a more progressive, conceptual twist to it. In response, Hank Shermann formed the band Fate, which pursued a more AOR direction.

&gt; Reunion

&gt; In July 1992, the band reformed and signed a contract with Brian Slagel's Metal Blade Records. All the original members without Kim Ruzz (replaced by Morten Nielsen) reformed and released In the Shadows in 1993. The album featured a re-recording of ""Return of the Vampire"", with Metallica drummer and Mercyful Fate enthusiast Lars Ulrich playing on the track. In the years since, the band has released four other albums, with the last being 9. Similar to the band's first run, members have left and been replaced; Michael Denner left and was replaced by Mike Wead, Drummer Nielsen was later replaced by Snowy Shaw who was then replaced by Bjarne Holm, Bassist Timi Hansen left quickly and was replaced by Sharlee D'Angelo. Following the release of 9 (1999), King Diamond put Mercyful Fate on hold and continued his solo career. Shermann, Denner, Holm and (King Diamond Bass player) Hal Patino formed Force of Evil, which incorporates many of the themes of the original Mercyful Fate.

&gt; In a March, 2008 interview, King Diamond stated that Mercyful Fate is currently ""hibernating"", but had never split up. Though he does not know when the band will become active again, he said ""It's definitely not finished, at least in my book."". With the Re-union in 1993, the same lineup returned for the album and European tour, with the exception of Drummer Kim Ruzz, who was replaced by Snowy Shaw. Bassist Timi Hansen also left after the European leg of the tour, and was replaced by Sharlee D'Angelo.

&gt; The Lineup remained the same for ""Time"" and ""Into the Unknown"". Snowy Shaw was then replaced by Bjarne Holm on drums.

&gt; Unfortunatley, Michael Denner had also parted ways with the band at this point, to stay with his wife and family. His replacement was Mike Wead, who recorded with the band for ""Dead Again"" As well as ""9"" and has proven to be a sufficient replacement for Michael Denner.

&gt; Melissa

&gt; ""Melissa"" is the name of a skull King Diamond used to carry on stage, and also a fictional deceased witch that appears in three songs. Before the recordings of the album Melissa, King Diamond had acquired a human skeleton that he named ""Melissa"". He used the femur bones to make his trademark microphone handle. The skull was apparently stolen during a show in the Netherlands.

&gt; The skull was inspiration behind the album Melissa, and the title track of the album is very different from the rest of the album, as it is much slower than the other songs (which are speedier and more aggressive). The lyrics tell of a male protagonist (usually identified as King Diamond himself by fans) who lost the love of his life, who was a witch who was burnt at the stake by a Catholic priest. The story builds itself up around the emotions of the protagonist, who first feels sadness and uncertainty, hope for her to still be alive, and then rage over his loss. He swears revenge on the priest who burnt her, proclaiming that he must die in the name of hell. The song ends with a whisper that hints Melissa's spirit is still with the protagonist.

&gt; The second song Melissa appears on is on the album Don't Break the Oath in the song ""Come to the Sabbath"", once again at the climax of the album. The lyrics tell about a Satanic coven holding a sabbath, in which the protagonist emerges to perform a ritual to ""put an evil curse on the priest who took the life of Melissa"". Though she is not the focus of the lyrics this time, because of her mention the song is known as a ""Melissa song"". Additionally, one of the main characters on the King Diamond's album Them was named ""Missy"", which is a common diminutive of Melissa.

&gt; The final song Melissa appears in is on Mercyful Fate's reunion album In the Shadows on the song ""Is That You, Melissa?"". The lyrics tell of the protagonist once again in sorrow about the loss of his love. He begins to hear her voice and goes to the coven to have them perform a ritual to speak with her ghost. The coven objects, saying that it is against the rules. The protagonist is visited by Melissa's spirit who shares a kiss with the protagonist. The subject of the song is argued by some; one side says the lyrics are not a continuation of the Melissa story but a tribute by the band to their past, while the other side sees it as the end of the Melissa story. It is widely accepted that she is the girl on the album cover of ""In the Shadows"" facing the old oak tree. After In the Shadows, Melissa has not been mentioned any more in both lyrics and artwork.

Frobeniu5,,,"The older Iranian generation has no realistic concept of politics and citizenship. Their understanding of government is that some person, group, or party has absolute power and total responsibility. This is because they have historically had little exposure to how a democracy functions. There's a cultural tendency, reflected in Shia Islam also, of waiting for some heroic person to take control and fix everything. They're waiting for a savior.

During the Shah's time, they thought if Khomeini ""took over"" and had full control, everything would be fixed. It obviously didn't turn out that way, but rather than reflecting and realizing the entire expectation is ill-founded, they now want someone else to take over and fix everything. 

The Pahlavi guy is more or less a blank slate so people project their ideas onto him. A bit like how Khomeini was a blank slate to some degree, but with much less actual leadership and charisma. Most of his supporters are Iranians who left Iran right after the revolution and who live in some sort of time bubble, completely oblivious to the deep social changes that have occurred since.

Most Iranians in Iran have never lived under a Shah. Pre-revolution Iran might as well be pre-Islamic Persia to them, something out of history books. At the same time, the younger generation has grown up exposed to Western media, and with access to information via internet, and has a much better understanding of how politics is done in Europe and the US. They have a much more sound conception of how citizens partake in government, and how power is held responsible. Expecting this generation to accept a Shah is more or less like expecting Americans to rejoin the British Empire. Expecting them to support MEK is like expecting them to join the Westboro Baptist Church. It's so mind-numbingly absurd that it becomes hard to explain.

Jefferson states it quite well in this letter from Paris to an anti-federalist dated 1/16/1787. Thing is, we're never ever going to be able to force people to read what they're """"supposed to read"""", but we can publish arguments. I think I'm more secure in knowing there are more people who aren't fooled by the b.s. than people who are. (edit: like those so called ""Jeffersonian Republicans"" who hate poor people so much on Facebook, heh)

&gt;The tumults in America, I expected would have produced in Europe an unfavorable opinion of our political state. But it has not. On the contrary, the small effect of those tumults seems to have given more confidence in the firmness of our governments. The interposition of the people themselves on the side of government has had a great effect on the opinion here. I am persuaded myself that the good sense of the people will always be found to be the best army. They may be led astray for a moment, but will soon correct themselves. The people are the only censors of their governors: and even their errors will tend to keep these to the true principles of their institution. To punish these errors too severely would be to suppress the only safeguard of the public liberty. **The way to prevent these irregular interpositions of the people is to give them full information of their affairs thro’ the channel of the public papers, and to contrive that those papers should penetrate the whole mass of the people**. The basis of our governments being the opinion of the people, the very first object should be to keep that right; and were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter. But I should mean that every man should receive those papers and be capable of reading them. I am convinced that those societies (as the Indians) which live without government enjoy in their general mass an infinitely greater degree of happiness than those who live under European governments. Among the former, public opinion is in the place of law, and restrains morals as powerfully as laws ever did any where. Among the latter, under pretence of governing they have divided their nations into two classes, wolves and sheep. I do not exaggerate. This is a true picture of Europe. Cherish therefore the spirit of our people, and keep alive their attention. **Do not be too severe upon their errors, but reclaim them by enlightening them. If once they become inattentive to the public affairs, you and I, and Congress, and Assemblies, judges and governors shall all become wolves.

&gt;Inspiring young people to serve others


&gt;1 January 2004


&gt;HLUBOKA, Czech Republic — A six-day gathering to inspire Baha'i youth to make their contribution to the welfare of humanity attracted participants from more than 30 countries.


&gt;The world's suffering was a ""call to action,"" a keynote speaker told participants at the ""Changing Times"" seminar, which was held at the [Townshend International School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townshend_International_School) here from 26 December 2003 to 1 January 2004.


&gt;""Today we are witnessing the disintegration of international order,"" said [Robert Henderson](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnThisDateInBahai/comments/6p1gti/july_23_on_this_date_in_1995_the_nsa_of_the_us/), the secretary-general of the [National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_Faith_in_the_United_States).



&gt;""Sovereign states are unable to stop the spread of terrorism and war, to stabilize the world economy or to alleviate the sufferings of millions,"" said [Dr. Henderson](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnThisDateInBahai/comments/6p1gti/july_23_on_this_date_in_1995_the_nsa_of_the_us/), drawing on analysis by Shoghi Effendi and messages from the Universal House of Justice.


&gt;[Baha'i youth](https://bahaikipedia.org/Junior_Youth_Group), he said, should strive to become examples of the transforming power of Baha'u'llah.


&gt;They should ""elevate the atmosphere"" in which they live, face challenges with confidence and become the embodiment of excellence in their personal lives, academic training, professions, and spiritual qualities.


&gt;The atmosphere of the seminar was characterized by the joy and camaraderie of the some 220 participants. In addition to the many [European Baha'is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_Faith_in_Europe), attendees came from places as far away as Canada, the United States, Australia, and New Zealand.


&gt;The program also featured a talk by [Hamid Peseschkian](https://www.peseschkian.com/en/dr-hamid-peseschkian.html), a psychiatrist who spoke on marriage preparation, and Lesley Taherzadeh, who addressed aspects of Baha'i history.


&gt;Ms. Taherzadeh spoke about the heroes and heroines of the Faith -- and she offered a moving tribute to her late husband, [Adib Taherzadeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adib_Taherzadeh), a renowned Baha'i author who served on the Universal House of Justice.


&gt;[Ardawan Lalui](http://www.lalui.com/about-us.html), the project director of the [Townshend School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townshend_International_School), spoke about applying Baha'i principles to the workplace.



&gt;Topics by other speakers included the importance of ethics in business and the equality of men and women.


&gt;Workshops aimed at inspiring the youth to incorporate Baha'i principles into their lives included a focus on two current themes in Baha'i activities worldwide -- the arts in Baha'i community life (led by [Inder Manocha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inder_Manocha)), and the importance of devotional meetings (led by Katrina Modabber).


&gt;Both of those workshop topics were illustrated in the program itself. Among the artistic performances were those by international prize-winning violinists [Martha](https://www.martha-khadem-missagh.com/) and [Vahid Khadem-Missagh](http://www.khadem-missagh.com/), who performed with their father, [Bijan](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijan_Khadem-Missagh), at the official opening of the Terraces of the Shrine of the Bab in Haifa in May 2001.




&gt;Stand-up comedian [Inder Manocha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inder_Manocha), who performed at the ""Best of the Edinburgh Festival Showcase"" and has appeared on BBC programs, provided an evening of comedy.


&gt;A devotional meeting, in which music and the arts provided an uplifting atmosphere, was one of the highlights of the seminar.


&gt;The seminar was dedicated to two much beloved Baha'is who passed away in 2003 -- the Hand of the Cause of God [Ali-Akbar Furutan](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnThisDateInBahai/comments/7fv4bo/november_26_on_this_date_in_2003_alíakbar_furútan/), and former member of the Universal House of Justice [David Hofman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hofman).


&gt;The Changing Times seminar, organized by [European Baha'i](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_Faith_in_Europe) youth, was first held in 2002 and is scheduled to become an annual event.

No - I mean before Disney came along and destroyed decades of amazing stories instead of adapting them properly. There's no reason why they couldn't have made the EU ""Legends"" canon while still cleaning it up and porting it over. Almost every concept they've imported from the Disney versions has been in some way ripped from the EU and subsequently watered down to make it less impressive. 

For example, Anakin Solo went so fucking hard that he literally became one with the Force while fighting - his body was *emitting the motherfucking force* while he took out the Voxxin - sound familiar? 

While still wracked with grief over his little brother's death, Jacen Solo becomes Darth Caedus in order to save his daughter and wife, and his own twin sister had to fucking kill him because he refused to return to the light. This is a much better story than ""Ben Solo falls the dark side *just because* and softly strokes the hands of Rey Random.""

Luke winds up marrying a reformed Sith apprentice named Mara Jade and has a son named Ben Skywalker - you know, the person who actually *should have named his kid Ben* actually did (because Han hated Obi-Wan and Leia never even fucking met the dude). Then Mara is subsequently murdered by Jacen to complete his ascent to the dark side stirring up the enmity of his cousin/trainee, Ben Skywalker.

This is a common misconception about Canada. Canada experiences a temperature range of almost 80 degrees Centigrade: from -40 (uncommon, but not unheard of) to +40 (uncommon but not un heard of) 20-30 degrees is the average for an Ontarian summer.

I only have 2 pieces of real advise in relation to visiting Canada and one reality check:

* 1: **DO IT**

* 2: **Bring a lot of money** I've heard that Canada is rather expensive compared to other countries.

* 3: **Canada is MASSIVE!!**

For example, One could visit every country in continental Europe by car within a 24hr period. One could drive NorthWest, from my hometown of Ottawa, for the same 24hr period and only just have left the province of Ontario. It takes Roughly 3 full days to travel from Ontario to British Columbia.

MinTamor,,,"&gt; People seem to enjoy Brie, Carlsberg and Danish bacon, at current prices. 

Well, people are stupid, and sometimes the government needs to protect them from themselves. 

The fact that overpaid Londoners are happy to cut the throats of British regional producers so that they can signal their ""international"" sophistication by drinking Continental Fighting Lagers and driving Maseratis is pretty much Brexit in microcosm. The French behave [rather differently] (https://www.politico.eu/article/belgium-calls-for-eu-help-against-french-gastronationalism/), which is probably why they're richer than we are, have less income and regional inequality and work fewer hours. 

&gt; because the economies of scale mean that decentralized production is more costly

I fear you might just have run out of economics.

You see, as Krugman put it, the EU's Single Market is ""good for Belgium, bad for Spain"". It's sucked stable employment out of the EU's periphery and centralised it in what the IMF calls the German-Central European Supply Chain-Cluster.

Any economies of scale produced by this process are dwarfed by its *diseconomies* of scale. 

You see, the unemployed industrial workers of Lancashire and Navarre do not simply disappear in a puff of smoke. Nor do they  learn Czech and move to Prague, as seems to be the fantasy of Europhile economists. In the real world, that option's really not on the table. It's part of what Richard Thaler calls the distinction between ""Econs"" and ""Humans"". 

Rather, they live on benefits, or in their mum's council flat, or in insecure zero-hour jobs topped up by tax credits. All of which has to be paid for by Britain's increasingly narrow-based economy. 

And as economists like Dani Rodrik have proven, there's no efficient way of forcing the winners from the tariff-reduction process to compensate the losers. The EU's Single Market, like other globalist ventures, has probably produced modest gains in overall output, but these have come at the cost of chronic inter-group dislocation and misery.

DoomChaver,,,"Maine was merged with Massachusetts as part of a revised royal charter in 1691, following the events two major wars between Europeans and indigenous peoples that had a huge impact on both Massachusetts and Maine. 

The first was King Phillip's War (1675-76) in which basically all Europeans (at least the English) were driven out of Southern and Downeast Maine. King Phillip was actually an indigenous leader who has his powerbase in Connecticut but other natives joined his uprising (though I believe that the peoples of Maine didn't get their activities going until Phillip was close to defeated, so for them King Phillip's war was more like 1676-78). 

The second was King William's War (1688-1697) was conflict between France and England that involved their colonies as well as many local indigenous peoples as allies and enemies. This war again saw the depopulation of Europeans in Maine, but I can't remember if they were completely driven out this time.

I of course agree that the current internal cultural crisis in the West is paramount and requires immediate attention from people interested in saving the West. On the other hand, China poses a long-term threat both in terms of hard power (economic/military) and soft power (propaganda, cultural influence, etc.). My general interest lately has been in China per se as a mostly foreign but also domestic threat, one that is rightly a high priority on the Trump agenda. I've been amassing articles on China mostly for self-education and to learn from comments like yours. China's propaganda efforts here and elsewhere in the West are part of the total picture.

Brentford have been one of the most competitive teams in the Championship away from home. Wolves are naturally very strong at Molineux, but I’d be shocked if they’re able to keep Brentford silent. Brentford were scoreless in their first three road matches of the season but have only failed to score in one since then, scoring multiple times in seven of those. I think Wolves will do their part and expect Brentford to compete as well. 

From when I took this bet yesteday, the line has moved considerably to around 1.55. For what it’s worth I think the line will tread back the other direction. We’ll see. I think it’s fine to take it at 2.75 or 3 for better odds but I think there’s a real good chance this one ends like 2-1.

But as I said, which you have yet to counter, this is economists saying that their predictions were wrong, and in doing so blaming Brexit for the misalignment.

Ignoring this bit that was wrong: -

&gt; The pre-referendum estimates of the long-term pain ranged from a hit to the economy of 1 per cent to 9 per cent of national income — an annual loss of gross domestic product of between £20bn and £180bn compared with remaining in the EU.

&gt; Economists for Brexit, a forecasting group, predicted that after a leave vote growth in GDP would expand 2.7 per cent in 2017. The Treasury expected a mild recession. Neither proved correct. The 2017 growth rate appears likely to slow to 1.5 per cent at a time when the global economy is strengthening.

Let's just pick out the bits in the article that you like shall we?

So economic projections from all directions proved to be massively wrong. At least the leave projections showed positive growth, so we're on the right side of the axis on the graph.

Here in my part of Europe, it is normal for children to attend day-care 4/5 times a week, regardless of the parents income or job, from the age of 6 month to 2.5 years. At 2,5 years, they start preschool...

We have no significant more ""tubes"" in Europe than in any other part of the world... We have no more sick children in Europe than in any other part of the world... I will admit my (gifted) daughter had the usual sicknesses but not specially more than any other kid and she started day-care at 5 months...  And those children who skip day-care and only start school at 2.5 years, have not built up their immune system as much as the others and tend to be more sick in their first year of being around other kids...

My daughter is the same age as the daughter of a colleague of mine. My daughter attended day-care, his did not. My daughter was a little bit more self dependent and assertive than his. Mine was more used to be around other children, to demand her place in the pack, to ""fight"" for her right, to stand up to bigger children, to protect her toys and to share the attention of the kindergarten-cop but also to wait for her turn, to share toys and to help and protect smaller kids...

DaveChild,,Lib Dem / Pro EU,"&gt; That counts as a diplomatic triumph; and, yes, a cause for optimism.

It was about six months too late to be considered any sort of triumph. It's progress. Late, underwhelming, but progress nonetheless. 

&gt; I may be the only person who voted for Brexit to get more but fairer immigration. 

Utter bullshit. Leaving the EU makes no sense if you want to liberalise immigration for other nations. It's about bringing down EU immigration, whether you try to dress it up in a ""fairness"" costume or not.

&gt; Brexit had to happen because the EU was plainly unreformable. 

The author must have missed the bit where the EU agreed unprecedented opt-outs and protections for the UK against further integration and pressure on us to join the Euro.

I like how people think that ""culture"" is what breeds variety.

It breeds the opposite. What culture creates is different bland homogenous places next to each other where all the people are the same and next to it is another bland place where all the people are the same in a different way.

""culture"" is a fancy way of saying ""I feel the need to do things and believe things purely because my parents did it.""; it creates homogeneity.

Okay, here's a better argument:

Torch it all because it's fucking stupid to continue with ""traditions"" just because ""that's how we always did it"" even when it makes no sense. Actions should have merit on their own self.

Following traditions is the hallmark of a fool.

When the european conquistadors got in the new land, they would have sex with natives and blacks (sometime later).

So you can even see this (miscigenation) as more of a trend to portuguese and spanish, while the english and french used to put ""family starter packs"" on the ships so they could populate the new lands with people from the country of origin.

So the french and englishman were also interested in colonize the new lands, while the portuguese and spanish were only interested in get the goods from the new lands back to europe.

Later in colonial Brazil for instance, it were not uncommon that the white landlord used the black women slaves as 'ama-de-leite', to feed their newborn with breast milk. This in turn would make the children of white people having emotional bonds with some blacks. Also white landlords would use some women slaves to have inter-marital sex, given birth to a 'mulato' children.

It was really a slow social construction with different outcomes compared to other countries with slavery.

&gt;**Esse é o valor médio que os brasileiros com até 25 anos de idade vão repassar ao governo ao longo da vida para cobrir os déficits do INSS e da aposentadoria dos servidores federais**  


&gt; Essas cifras, vale reforçar, se referem somente ao custo para cobrir o déficit previdenciário, isto é, para tapar o enorme buraco que já existe – e crescerá – entre a arrecadação de contribuições e o pagamento de benefícios. Além de honrar essa “dívida”, os jovens brasileiros também terão de fazer as devidas contribuições para custear sua própria aposentadoria, via INSS, regimes próprios do funcionalismo ou previdência privada. Os números constam de um relatório do Tesouro Nacional que estima o chamado resultado atuarial, cálculo contábil que traz para valor presente as receitas e compromissos futuros do sistema previdenciário. LEIA TAMBÉM: Governo terá de elevar impostos para cobrir o rombo O estudo, publicado em novembro, aponta para um déficit atuarial de R$ 9,23 trilhões na soma do INSS com o regime próprio dos servidores civis da União. Em outras palavras, nas próximas décadas o país terá de gastar o equivalente a um ano e meio de geração de riquezas para compensar o rombo no pagamento de aposentadorias e pensões desses dois regimes. As aposentadorias, pensões e benefícios assistenciais pagos pelo regime geral, que há três anos representavam 40,8% de todas as despesas primárias (não relacionadas à dívida) da União, hoje consomem 48,3% desse dinheiro. “Será necessário aumentar a carga tributária em aproximadamente 8,5% do PIB nos próximos 40 anos, ou reduzir, na mesma proporção, outras despesas, inclusive as demais da Seguridade Social”, alerta o relatório.

Nheea,,,"&gt; Asa functioneaza o obligatie, chiar daca nu o sa intre cineva in casa peste tine, amenzi peste amenzi (care ar putea deveni o simpla taxa) sau chiar inchisoarea lasa oamenii fara alternative, este ca si cand eu te-as intreba, imi dai si mie putin din banii tai? In timp ce raspunsul nu atrage dupa sine sanctiuni pe care nu poti sa ti le permiti.

DACA legea te-ar fi fortat sa-ti faci rau, intelegeam. Dar legea protejeaza un copil nevinovat, ii da o sansa in plus la viata cu fiecare vaccin. Deci nu e ca si cand te obliga sa-ti dai foc, ci sa ai grija de o fiinta care nu se poate ingriji singura. Daca nu voiai sa faci asta, atunci nu trebuia sa faci copil. Nu ai grija de el? Platesti. Prin amenda sau ridicarea drepturilor parentale, care nu-s mai presus de drepturile copilului la viata si sanatate.

&gt;si anume cea de a administra anumite substante cetatenilor pur cu scopul de cercetare sau de imbunatatirea unui alt vaccin

te rog eu, nu mai inventa chestii. Vaccinurile sunt testate de sute de ori pana sunt puse pe piata. 

&gt;care isi abuzeaza cetatenii, si chiar daca ti se pare ca acest lucru nu s-ar putea intampla, chiar daca s-a intamplat in tari civilizate de-a lungul istoriei, argumentul are o baza logica.

Nu zic nu. S-au intampla nenorociri, dar nu se mai intampla acum.

De ex in cazul vaccinurilor, regulile cercetarii si testarii lor sunt ff aspre, de-aia multi si abandoneaza productiile unor vaccinuri sau testarea unor noi vaccinuri. Nu renteaza. Chit ca ar fi fost in beneficiul populatiei. Dar regulile nu mai sunt ca pe vremea lu' bunicu' iar vaccinurile nu se produc pe repede inainte si ilegal sau nesigur (gen Polidinul de la Cantacuzino care a fost testat pe cei care-l produceau, nu pe vreun alt lot de oameni. Nu era prea etic sau sigur!).

Deci asta pica. Se mai pot intampla lucruri neplacute, de ex faza cu vaccinul BCG de acum cativa ani, cand s-a adus vaccinul cu tulpina din Danemarca, pt ca ai nostri nu-l mai aveau. iar tulpina respectiva a fost mult mai reactogena, si deci au exista multe reactii adverse neplacute. Dar nu a murit nimeni, vaccinul a fost retras de la noi si aia e. A fost o situatie naspa, cauzata de ineficienta si incompetenta statului, care nu a comandat la timp vaccinuri. Nici vorba de intentii rele sa sufere populatia.

&gt;Simplu, pentru ca bebelusul apartine/este in grija acelui parinte si astfel el este autoritatea pentru ce i se intampla copilului sau. 

Nimeni nu apartine nimanui. Ca nu suntem animale. Parintele are obligatia sa isi creasca spawn-ul. Nu inseamna ca-i apartine.

&gt;atunci mi se pare ca statul pur si simplu nu este indreptatit sa faca acea decizie.

ti se pare.

&gt;Ca riscul trebuie evaluat de catre cel care isi asuma rezultatul, in acest caz parintele.

Pe baza caror cunostinte? De pe site-uri de genul bucovinaprofunda?

Puhleease!

&gt;Intreb in mod sincer pentru ca nu stiu ce sa cred, daca vaccinurile de acel tip ar fi fost obligatorii, s-ar fi vaccinat toti copiii? pentru ca ai zis ca spre deosebire de acest vaccin cel ""Hexacima"" este recuperat, de ce exista aceasta diferenta?

Nu prea pricep ce vrei sa spui.

S-ar fi vaccinat copii ai caror parinti ar fi fost de acord. 

Diferenta exista cel mai probabil din cauza zvonurile legate de MMR/ROR, care e vaccinul celebru pe care nemernicul de [Andrew Wakefield](https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield) l-ar fi acuzat ca provoaca autism.

Desi zvonul a fost infirmat de mult si ""lucrarea stiintifica"" retrasa de mult si dezmintita prin zeci sau sute de alte studii care nu gasesc acea corelatie, parintii inca se tem de acest vaccin.

Pe grupul de Facebbok pt informare despre vaccinuri, la mai bine de 10 ani dupa ce acest mit a fost infirmat, parintii inca mai aud ca ROR ar produce autism. Deci normal ca lumea fuge de el daca se informeaza de la vecini sau magazin.

ThwartChimes,,,"In what country do you live? I assume the Netherlands?

It's similarly frowned-upon to discuss salary in the US but it's very slowly changing (at least in some industries... mainly tech). There's a growing recognition that salary secrecy suppresses wages. Mixed with the silly salaries of software engineers in the US (even by their own reckoning), I've noticed people have started opening up about what they make.

Something else that might be throwing me off: it seems you're citing pay *after* social security and other taxes? If so, is that a normal approach among European countries? The US almost exclusively cites salary before all applicable taxes. It seems the numbers might actually be a lot closer than I thought.

I've been wanting to move to Europe for a while. For all I know, I might get home sick after a few years and move back, but I'm very undertraveled and really want to spend some time in Europe. Not being able to speak the native language is the biggest hesitation (and, apparently, wages... but maybe I can pull off an internal transfer?).

I did a quick look. It appears about 8% of individuals in the US make over $100,000/yr while roughly 20% of households do the same. I tried to find a similar stat for the Netherlands but had trouble. I wonder if the number you cited is slightly low due to the economic conditions of 2008/2009.

Edit: I found [this website](http://visualisatie.cbs.nl/en-GB/visualisation/inkomensverdeling) that shows disposable income. It claims 1.7% of households in the Netherlands have disposable income above 100K/year Euros. 100K in USD is roughly 83K in Euros. About 3.2% of households have disposable income above 83K.

JDFidelius,,,"&gt;  Can you explain how you mean that costs are minimized here?

I'm going off the assumption that taxpayers wouldn't fund a system that doesn't attempt to minimize costs. This means removing a lot of general education classes that don't contribute to the knowledge that you'll use in your future career, and perhaps also shortening the time in school. It also means larger class sizes and less one-on-one time with professors.

&gt;I'm not sure liberals only take non-economically viable degrees though... But why would they not be able to take them? They wouldn't be able to get a job afterwards, but that's already true. I didn't really understand that point. Do you believe we don't have humanities in Norway?

Humanities and the likes here in the US are nearly exclusively pursued by liberal and leftist minded people. Conservatives are not welcome in a lot of those classes due to professors and students alike shaming them or otherwise not making them feel welcome. I'd imagine it's pretty similar in Norway, if not more exaggerated (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVaTc15plVs go look at what the humanities professors say about their basic assumptions of sex differences).

I would think that, if you are trying to minimize costs of institutions, you would reduce the size of humanities departments unless it is shown that those students do well financially after school *for reasons other than the fact that they come from rich families* (in the US, many liberal arts majors do fine after college because they come from well-to-do families; it's the liberal arts majors that come from middle class and poorer families that get screwed with such majors and have to take a job at Starbucks or McDonalds). A reasonable explanation for the continued hegemony of liberal arts even in a cost-minimized system would thus be societal; Scandinavian and other northern European countries are more humanistic and appreciate the arts more than Americans do, I would say.

&gt;I assume you mean ""social democratic"" here, not ""socialist""?

Yes, I'm not too familiar with the terminology since I haven't taken classes on this stuff, but I'm looking for the word to describe a taxpayer-funded education system that is open to all. Social democratic just by its name seems to be a much more accurate term for this than socialist.

And something about your other comment about the linguistic difference between the state and the government: we also understand ""the state"" to mean ""the goverment"", but it's mostly more intellectual people that use this term, at least in my experience. I think that a big difference between Norway and the US is that ""the government"" feels like this foreign, self-contained entity. Many Americans very much view it as a monolith and not as the sum of millions of fellow Americans working under the same organization. If Norwegians are less likely to view it as a monolith than Americans, I would probably say that it's due to the fact that literally 22 of the 50 states in the US have a larger population than Norway. California alone has almost 40 million people! It's a lot harder for me to view the government not as a monolith when it's millions of people I don't know all partaking in a system. Compare this to the local government, where it is very much viewed as neighbors and locals participating in civil service. The massive scale of the governments in the US is what leads to 'the government' being a foreign entity (I know that your comment was about 'state' vs. 'government' but I just wanted to throw this in there too).",True,0,1514918374,,False,0,ds38u5b,False,t3_7nhl2d,t1_ds373wl,/r/todayilearned/comments/7nhl2d/til_if_you_publish_a_book_in_norway_the/ds38u5b/,1517495233,1,False,todayilearned,t5_2qqjc,public,

&gt; You've elected an unbroken string of pro-war Presidents, Democrats and Republicans alike.

That's not completely true. 

Obama was anti-war, he inherited Iraq/Afghanistan. And the reality is we create bad vacuums when we bail. Hence ISIS. Look at Japan, Germany and South Korea and notice how America still hasn't left (though different reasons). I wouldn't call Obama a war monger, I would say he didn't take control over the reckless use of strikes. It seemed like we were killing a lot civilians and the US wasn't really hearing that.

Clinton was also not pro-war at all. The only conflict his 8 years encountered was Serbia. And I'm sure there are a great deal of Americans who don't even remember it. For a war monger he surely acted in the least with the heaviest level of hesitation.

Jimmy wasn't much pro-war either. He inherited a mess and made bad actions. 

I'm not saying that the US isn't war based. I'm saying we don't purposely elect politicians that are war mongers. Some clearly feel that way. But liberals are clearly opposed, it's just they still get dragged in.

&gt; You've spent coming up on ten trillion dollars - that's ten million million dollars - on warfare in this century alone, and yet both parties keep heaping more money into the flames.

I won't argue that our defense spending is ... well ridiculous. However, it's not like we are Saudi Arabia (#3) in which we are buying external items. The US defense complex is almost completely internal. And the only industry regulated and forced to be 100% American (with obvious exceptions). The majority of defense spending is upkeep. So to really hit that down we have to agree to have less standing forces with a lot lower tech equipment. Marines and Coast Guard prove over and over that is possible. But the overwhelming spending is mostly R&amp;D and development. New technology.

The biggest problem is because of the restrictions and the way the defense industry has to operate it's 'seemingly' the biggest bang for your buck when it comes to GDP. Senators and Congress people will routinely back a new DOD project, so long as it brings X jobs to their state. You talk later about this issue, but that's what keeps the DOD spending from being $300-400B instead of the $700B it is now.

It's lazy, but the rationale is clear.

&gt;  And you go out of your way to brutalize anyone who even talks about a third party - even if they explain that they simply can't support D or R because of their reasoned opposition to war.

What? As above, I can't think of a Democrat that was even remotely pro-war in an election process.

We don't like 3rd party voting on election days because despite our constitution having nothing against a multiparty system, historically we have flocked to two parties and invented external rules about 2 parties. Ultimately by the time it matters, it will only be 2 candidates. So you'll hear ""vote for the lesser of two evils"" because as we have seen before (cough 2000 presidential) the third party can cause a lot of harm. You could say an Idiot and Penguin might run your country if you do. 

The issue isn't so much with the alternative parties is that these parties only use a very very small portion of the populace to decide who will be the front runner. Basically 2 idiots go to the grocer to pick up food for a large dinner party. They have hundreds of options, but they pick 2 items each of their own liking. Guest are presented the option for a main course of (1) frozen mini burgers or (2) Chicken Nuggets and Egos. The issue wasn't the grocery store selection, it was the fact that the Dinner Host sent Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb.

So you can get more involved early to avoid Chicken Nuggets, but ultimately if you want that upfront decision to have a meaningful impact you are still going to have to jump on a major party. The third party options don't have a lot of traction. And many of them take on ridiculous opinion just stay relevant. What we have is a lot of diverse ideas in a single party instead of a bunch of diverse parties.

&gt; And we've seen your movies and TV programs. We've seen the endless GIFs on Reddit with servicemen returning home, the pictures of incredibly expensive weapons of destruction with thousands of upvotes every time and anyone saying, ""But that is billions of dollars we could have used to invest in something useful"" is downvoted into oblivion.

On Reddit? No. That's the easiest way to get upvotes other than having a cat with a heart shape birthmark on it's nose.

I'm all for investing that into infrastructure, medicinal industry, medical industry/research, etc. That's not an un-American thing to say. However, politicians look at jobs, tech, GDP. I think right now, most Americans would be happier with less spending. 

I call BS to this issue. I mean short of T_d, I don't know where that comment would be downvoted.

&gt; America simply loves war. 

Simply disagree. America loves content. And the middle class is content. As long as they are, the rest is easily obtainable by the oligarchy that actually runs the show.

&gt; You're willing to allow your infrastructure to crumble, to pay through the nose for healthcare and get third world outcomes for that, to allow your entire middle class to be eroded, and all of this to pay for endless wars, wars in tiny, technologically-backward places you couldn't identify on a map, wars in countries that mostly never offered you the slightest harm at all, and particularly, failed wars that did not achieve their stated military, geopolitical, or economic goals to the slightest extent.

Wars aren't our biggest expense. Sadly to say. That's probably why it's so easy to add to. 

&gt; to pay through the nose for healthcare 

We don't actually pay through the nose. That's our problem here. Our problem is the lack of single payer. So we pay a tremendous amount less in Taxes, but make pretty much every other social welfare the issue of the citizen. Which isn't fair to the poor or the needy. That's our issue. I know reddit likes to show how much we pay in medical expenses and everyone shows their EU bill. But that's not big picture. The average US citizen's Medical + Taxes is still a lot fucking less than UK Taxes alone. Our problem is that we seem to think this is an entitlement as if it was a bad word.

I think we are getting to the point where the expense will get so bad, the US population will start to really understand Single Payer. This isn't health care cost. The cost is the cost. The issue is the payer. We fuck over the lower classes, and I couldn't tell you why we like to. 

&gt; If you don't like this picture, then do something about it. Don't complain to people on the Internet that it's unfair that you're tarnished with the ""war cult"" brush when it's absolutely fucking true - get angry, and use that anger to get busy.

Yes because we aren't also the country of protest. Thank you for the lecture.

No one complained that it's unfair, the statement above was that the US was **FOUNDED** on Bronze Age War Cults. That's just simply not true. Historically that's completely wrong. Mainly because our founders were mostly agnostic or atheist. I mean our second president was sworn in our a book of laws because he felt the bible was non-sense. So calling a bunch of founders who idealized the enlightenment movement bronze age is just incorrect. Period.

The first age of endless war was really brought on by the war of 1812. This where the US realized it wasn't going to be independent and a country with a militia army was rubbish. But if you want to attack our current defense spending, the real historical event was WWII, but really it was that extreme spending pulled us out of a depression and then apparently is a really good GDP tool, which is nice for a country of farms.

You can call us ""War Based"" or ""Conflict Hogs"". We agree. Actually a lot of us would like to be isolationist and let the world fuck off.

Small beers are thought to have been a drink of choice among Medieval Europeans and North American colonists alike. Commonly referred to as ""porridge-like"" in consistency, small beers were often unfiltered, and widely recognized for being hydrating and, to an extent, nourishing (with the added benefit of being more sanitary than water). In this way, small beer came to enjoy quite the following. Even George Washington was a fan...

The idea that people drank beer to hydrate is not just some apologist bullshit but rooted in history.

CaravanOfDeath,,Cronus’ No.10 fan 🐿,"After thrashing out the terms of its divorce with the European Union last year, Britain's has its attention set on the future. For the new year, diplomats are moving onto a new phase in the Brexit talks. 

European leaders could not ignore Britain's ongoing departure when they welcomed in 2018. They sought to echo the insouciance projected by Jean-Claude Juncker last September when he told the denizens of Brussels that their project ""must advance"" without Britain [""because Brexit is not everything"".](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-17-3165_en.htm) Their aim is to show they are not cut up about Brexit by busily pushing on with further integration.

Emmanuel Macron called on his ""fellow European citizens"" to ""reinvigorate European ambitions"", insisting that ""France can't succeed without a strong Europe."" Meanwhile Angela Merkel [declared](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/31/world/europe/germany-angela-merkel-new-year.html) that ""no matter what, Germany’s future is bound"" to that of the EU and called on ""the 27 nations in Europe"" to ""more than ever...stick together"".

As easy as it may be to interpret such talk as a snub to the ""deep and special partnership"" the British Government seeks with the bloc after Brexit, there is something deeper to note: they aren't in any doubt that Britain is leaving.

Monsieur Macron liked to tease the British in his early days as president, breezily declaring last year that there was [""always a chance to reopen the door""](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/09/29/eu-leaders-really-think-britain-could-ever-rejoin-do-treat-us/) if Britain wanted to back down on leaving. He later fleshed out a vision for Europe in which he said he could not [""imagine that Britain could not find its place.""](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/09/26/emmanuel-macron-says-britain-will-have-place-inreformed-simplified/) 

But now he kicks off this year by railing against ""giving way on anything"" to ""nationalists"" or ""skeptics"". That is not the tone of a leader who expects Britain to walk back through the door, if it remains open at all.

European leaders are getting on with the tricky task of adapting to life without one of their club's biggest net contributors, with the Commission starting to try and get [more money out of the remaining members in order to fulfill its budgetary ambitions.](https://www.ft.com/content/7c11ba4c-e565-11e7-8b99-0191e45377ec) Officials know how much money they stand to get from the British, but now they have to work out who else will plug the gap.

(This process will be far from simple incidentally. One of the [biggest net beneficiaries of EU funds is Poland,](https://financialobserver.eu/recent-news/poland-is-net-eur163m-beneficiary-with-eu-in-feb/) a nation that has become somewhat of a pariah state in the eyes of Brussels' bureaucrats amid the [current Article 7 row.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/12/18/eu-infighting-poland-poses-threat-theresa-mays-brexit-talks/) Can they resist the allure of [punishing the Polish financially](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-poland/poland-expects-uk-will-get-swiss-like-deal-with-eu-after-exit-idUKKBN15G5CH) for 'infringing EU values'?)

So even the EU accepts Britain is leaving. If only some Remainers would take notice, like the born again pro-EU [renegade Lord Adonis,](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/12/29/lord-adonis-resigns-theresa-mays-infrastructure-tsar-row-brexit/) as they carry on their quixotic campaign to stop Brexit. The Labour peer, who [ostentatiously went to see Monsieur Barnier in October alongside Ken Clarke and Nick Clegg,](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/30/rebels-say-clegg-clarke-adonis-meeting-eus-chief-brexit-negotiator/) told the Guardian that he thought the civil service was on his side, saying:

""I do not know a single senior civil servant who thinks that Brexit is the right policy, and those that are responsible for negotiating it are in a desperate and constant argument with the government over the need to minimise the damage done by the prime minister’s hard Brexit stance.""

If mandarins are really fighting against Theresa May's Brexit strategy as desperately as Lord Adonis makes out, they should reflect on why they're doing so. The British public has barely wavered in his support for Brexit, [as YouGov has found.](https://whatukthinks.org/eu/questions/in-highsight-do-you-think-britain-was-right-or-wrong-to-vote-to-leave-the-eu/) Remainers hoping to ride a popular backlash to stop it are set for disappointment.

A New Year is a time for resolutions, and European leaders have made their own one clear: to not let Brexit stop their project. They aren't trying to mount a last ditch plea to Britain, they are getting on with life. They may have had doubts at first, but the last few months have shown them that it's something they'll have to live with. 

Some Remainers have accepted that Britain is on its way out and are constructively engaging in the debate about what its future outside the EU should entail. As the talks move on, Remainers like Lord Adonis risk getting stuck fighting about the past.

whenthethingscollide,,,"Um...with regards to the first point, you do know that minorities, at least black minorities, didn't all collectively decide that they wanted to live together segregated from everyone else. It was white people who decided that. I suggest you look into discriminatory housing practices such as redlining that were used to make it such that black people would have a difficult time being able to even find places to live among white people. It's naive to blame ""self segregation"" while ignoring the larger forces at play for decades, keeping black people separate against their will. Minorities usually tend to live with each other in part because the majority group doesn't actually want them integrated, and in part because they need to be around those who are willing to lend support and help when needed. *sometimes, minorities are forced to ""self segregate"" regardless of whether or not they want to due to racism*

On to the rent point and places of living part, I'll again point to red lining once again just to dismiss the notion that wealth, not race, plays a role here. And I'll provide a few more sources to point out that race still does play a significant role on ones ability to find a place they want to live in and can afford.

These wealthy black people have discussed how they still face racial discrimination despite their money. Such as people not selling them property despite their financial ability to purchase it. 

With regards to the history classes, I'll point out that there were recently lawmakers in Arizona who tried to ban ethnic studies classes. Perhaps it's a bit too presumptuous to assume that different ethnicities will always be taught. There will at least be people trying to change that. And as far as I know, there aren't lawmakers trying to erase ""white ""history or European heritages from the academic record.

About the invisible knapsack, I think of it this way. 

When renting an apartment, let's say you get a place. If a hypothetical landlord decided to keep black applicants from living there and only accept white applicants, would a white applicant who was accepted recognize that they benefitted? Nope, not unless the landlord admitted to being racist. But they did benefit from the reduced competition. 

Are white kids significantly harmed by not having ethnic studies courses? No, because their heritages will likely still be taught about. 

If a white kid faces a judge that tends to show a bit more leniency towards white youth and gets a slap on the risk fine for their weed possession when they would've received a harder sentence had they been black, would they actually know? Nope. 

It's simple really. 

If competition and opportunity for one or more races is reduced, the other races benefit from the increased available resources. More apartments since some places won't rent to blacks. More jobs since some employers won't hire blacks. More cops pulling over minorities means less cops to pull over everyone else. But they wouldn't know it. The benefit is the knapsack, and the fact that it's easy to overlook is why it's invisible 

White privilege isn't really ""white people have it easier"" but rather ""white people have benefits directly related to being white (as opposed to rich or healthy) that they may not be cognizant of due to the very nature of those benefits"" which would mean that you can still have a tough life, tougher than non whites despite those benefits. But it doesn't change the fact that the benefits of whiteness are still in existence in greater society. And the evidence supports this, but you'd have to be exposed to it to know about it.

You seem to think it's just me. It's not just me, it's many people, both in NZ and Australia and in Europe and in America, who think that it was a terrorist attack. 

I've actually read the court ruling, and the judge who prosecuted the French agents has some really interesting things to say:

Of course there was intimidation: it was meant to prevent other Greenpeace attempts at protesting the nuclear testing.

kulio_forever,,,"&gt;And China has embarked on history’s most expensive foreign infrastructure plan. Under the Belt and Road Initiative, it is building bridges, railways, and ports in Asia, Africa, and beyond. If the initiative’s cost reaches a trillion dollars, as predicted, it will be more than seven times that of the Marshall Plan, which the U.S. launched in 1947, spending a hundred and thirty billion, in today’s dollars, on rebuilding postwar Europe.

See this is a faulty comparison, it seems to me.

These projects are getting priced at ""market rates"", I assume, and in many ways the prices are determined by China. I mean, China is offering construction services and financing for these projects, just sign on the dotted line and how many hookers should we send to the hotel tonight?

Those terms and the terms fixed by the US (I suspect they were also loans assumed by the European nations but not sure) are probably pretty different.

In addition, we have already seen China take control of the projects themselves, after the debtor nations find they can't pay. There quite possibly will be many more of these. 

That doesn't look much the same at all to me, unless you can show me all the projects paid for though the Marshall Plan that ended up owned by the US government after default.

Finally, these projects are (it seems to me) more selective as far as breadth of development. Ports. Toll roads. I think the Marshall Plan was probably broader in the development projects.

Trexrunner,imf image symbol,IMF,"&gt;In the rich and middle-income countries that make up the OECD, the median wage of a woman working full-time is 85% that of a man. This is not, as many assume, because employers pay a woman less than they would have paid a man in her place. Data from 25 countries collected by Korn Ferry, a consultancy, show that women earn 98% as much as men who do the same job for the same employer. The real reason is twofold. Women outnumber men in positions with lower salaries and little chance of promotion. And men and women are segregated between occupations and industries; those where women predominate pay less.

&gt;Just a fifth of senior executives in G7 countries are female. Across the European Union supervisors are more likely to be male, even when most of their underlings are female. Nearly 70% of working women in the EU are in occupations where at least 60% of workers are female. The top four jobs done by American women—teacher, nurse, secretary and health aide—are all at least 80% female.

&gt;Occupations dominated by women have lower status and pay. Primary teachers in the OECD earn 81% of the average for graduate jobs. Nurses earn less than police officers; cleaners less than caretakers.

Name calling isn't productive. The issue is as much a cultural one as a structural/legal one.

Some aren't as intelligent as whites. Others are smarter. Blacks, on average, have a much lower IQ than whites. East Asians and Ashkenazi Jews, on the other hand, have a higher IQ on average. Make of it what you will, this is an objective fact.

There is really no way to measure talent. However, white Europeans have been responsible for most of the scientific, cultural, technological and philosophical accomplishments of humanity. This is a fact.

Doi. Nu ma gandeam la genul de ""pentru viitorul copilasilor"" in sensul de a-i creste cu lingura de aur in gura. Dar ca sanse sa se dezvolte si sa duca o viata normala, un copil are mult mai multe sanse aproape oriunde inafara Romaniei (mai ales in Canada?). In plus, situatia de genul ""uite cate am facut eu pentru tine si tu asa ma rasplatesti!"" se intampla oricum, chiar si in familiile sarace. Important nu e sa il creasca ei pe copil, ci sa ii ofere sanse mult mai bune decat ar avea aici (nu doar acum, ci si pe viitor, cand va deveni adult; in Romania daca ar vrea o viata mai buna, tot ce poate face e sa plece altundeva oricum - ar fi mult mai bine sa fie crescut de mic altundeva).

Cred si eu ca fericirea parintilor e un punct important, dar daca tot nu sunt in stare sa ajunga la o intelegere din cauza fericirii, atunci ar fi mai bine sa se gandeasca la copii. Copii sunt numitorul comun, si daca nu se gandesc la ei, atunci nu prea le dau sanse sa ramana impreuna si sa fie si amandoi fericiti in acelasi timp, ceea ce ar puta duce la dezbinare, pt. care tot copii vor ajunge sa plateasca pana la urma. Asa ca, eu unul cred ca ar face bine sa ia serios in calcul si viitorul copiilor de pe acum, decat sa ajunga toti cu reprosuri si probleme de familie mai tarziu.

Throwaway1223245,,,"Hey,

I suggest that you cash out in EUR, if you currently have £ instead of BTC on GDAX, play the market, reinvest it, then sell on the EUR market.

Once you've sold on the BTC/EUR market and you have your ~€5600 there, here's what you do:

- Open a Revolut account if you haven't done so already, active your EU account. and transfer your Euros from GDAX into there with a SEPA transfer. This is free. 

- From Revolut, you can exchange your € to £ at the interbank rate, with no commission. 

From Revolut, place your £ into your UK bank and pay your debts. 

Some things to note:

- Daily limit of ~€11k transfers out of GDAX if you're on the simplest verification.

- Monthly (free) Limit of £/€5000 transfers on Revolut

I would suggest you split this over two months to be safe. All of the above will be completely free. The only variables are:

- Play the markets to get the most € from your bitcoin on GDAX
- Watch the exchange rate on Revolut between £/€ to get most bang for your buck.

You won't need to declare this to HMRC, unless this  5k figure pushes you over the the 11.3k CGT allowance you get this financial year. If it does, take out the maximum you can this year while staying under 11.3k, then the rest in April for the 18/19 FY.

A) Jeg tror du grelt har misforstået hvad ""åbne grænser"" betyder.

B) Hvordan ændre det på noget, selv hvis det kun var arbejdere? Det er jo netop arbejderne jeg skriver om, da arbejderklassen udgør størstedelen af befolkningen i størstedelen af verden.

Tager 100.000 tilfældige EU-arbejdere (fra en hvilken som helst kombination af EU-lande) og 100.000 tilfældige afrikanske arbejdere, så vil EU-arbejderne være bedre uddannet, sundere, have en langt højere IQ, deres kultur vil flugte med vores og vi ville kunne kommunikere på enten engelsk, tysk eller spansk med dem.

vornash2,,1∆,"&gt; conned

There's a reason why some people call it the ""dark arts"" of persuasion, the people with buyers remorse, but academically it's just known as Persuasion, without any negative or biased connotations.

But there's your problem, this is how politics works sir.  Both parties lie, all politicians lie, we all know it, sometimes they're not major lies, sometimes they are.  Now this has been business as usual for so many decades, perhaps since our founding to some degree,  we just accept hyper partisanship as a way of life in America, when there are plenty of countries in Europe and elsewhere like Japan and South Korea with no political division even close to what we have.  

The biggest issue in Japan I know of is Japan should abandon decades of passivism militarily to counter China's growing power.  But I guarantee you Japanese people know most of our issues, while we know very few of theirs, sometimes due to ignorance yes, but also simply because their so homogeneous.

And please before you bring up the Nazi transformation of Germany, almost everyone who saw that transformation with their own eyes is dead now.  My grandma is 97 now, my last surviving grandparent.  Her husband, my grandfather went to war against the Nazis as a tank commander in Patton's 3rd army.  That generation is gone, sometimes called the greatest generation, certainly among areas of right-wing thinking.  My point in mentioning this is to understate the importance of remembering history in context of today.

The US had overt propaganda during WW2, same as the Nazis, however in some ways they were conned by the politics of the era, but the people loved it and they loved their Government.  But it's not really being conned, it's simply being lead in a particular direction under a particular philosophy, under the influence of socialization.  Dropping a nuke on Japan?  OK SKIPPER!  Flag saluting patriots in spirit.  But that's the last time our society looked in a orderly fashion, not with all this division and hatred at the highest levels of society as well as the lowest.  Yes racism still existed, but this in many ways was a golden era in American history that is now in slight decline, and even slight is an important psychological issue in politics, especially for the right.  

In fact, if you're smart, I would argue you may be more vulnerable to this phenomena of hyper partisanship.  But once you understand that facts don't matter, it's relieving to know that people are not crazy, they're just not rational, that's why we have so-called ""elites"" to guide us (or con us in a particular philosophy).


&gt; ""talking past the sale.""; and getting things intentionally wrong. Neither of these things are actually considered good persuasive techniques.

If you could provide some evidence from a book that's highly regarded on the same issues of Persuasion, I may be convinced otherwise, but based on what I know of what Scott has wrote about, I just don't think that's likely.

&gt;Try and look at Trump without trying to admire him or criticize him. Take a long and dispassionate look at not only the things he says, but at the way he behaves. His actions aren't those of a person trying to persuade anyone of anything, but rather to desperately cling to an already existing base.

That is literally the job of every politician.  People have not even fully explored or recognized the full reasons why Trump won, and they are complex as fuck, I know that, but I guarantee you, any  discerning political observe better also consider what people think about the economy (good) and the gap between where that is and where historical Presidential politicians have hovered on average.  People like myself, who may have voted for him, but don't fully appreciate his attitude 100% either.  Within that group, Trump has all the persuasion room in the world, those are his folks, the voted once, and they are not that are to sell later if economic conditions are near optimally expected, because it's always about expectations, psychology, voter sentiment is a beast that cannot be easily analyzed.

And the implications, going forward as people become numb to all this and it becomes more like something we simply have to tolerate for 4 years, that negative sentiment may dissipate.  We've gone from Trump is Hitler, to Trump is a stooge of Russia, to a reminder that Trump is accused of sexual misconduct that never goes to trial, to he's just incompetent now and didn't get anything done, and now we're at well he got some things done, but we don't like them (in a year).

&gt; We find that that once the occupational breakdown is incorporated into a regional analysis of immigration, the immigrant-native ratio has a statistically significant, small, negative impact on the average occupational wage rates of the regions. 

It found that the occupational groups that saw the most substantial cut in their incomes were the very poorest, such as care home workers. 

This finding comports with the most fundamental laws of supply, demand and price. It also aligns with the 2012 findings of the government's Migration Advisory Committee, which [found] (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/257235/analysis-of-the-impacts.pdf) that:

&gt; A ballpark estimate is that an extra 100 non-EU working-age migrants are initially associated with 23 fewer native people employed. Such evidence suggests that successive governments
since 2008 have been right to make non-EU migration more selective.

It also reflects the views of the former head of the Remain campaign Stuart Rose, who said that Brexit would drive up wages, which he views as a [bad thing] (http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/stuart-rose-businessman-who-backed-immigration-for-cutting-wages-to-lead-campaign-to-keep-britain-in-a6688561.html).

The reason I seem ""fairly bright"" is simply because I read long, boring PDF reports, and because I get my news from The Guardian but also from the The Daily Telegraph, to avoid being brainwashed. And because I don't believe the kind of economists who work as paid ""consultants"" for large enterprises, because I know they tailor their findings to suit the agenda of whoever's paying them. 

How do I know that? Because I've worked for exactly those kinds of economics consultancies, and have multiple friends who still do.

Edit: Incidentally - your linked-to example of a ""decent economist"" is a man who works for a university that takes economics so un-seriously it doesn't even offer it as a full degree.

EtiamPharetra,,,"Questa è un'ottima domanda.

Per non essere incostituzionale una tale presunzione dovrebbe cadere l'uguaglianza formale e sostanziale dei cittadini, con l'introduzione di una discriminazione per lo status di ""ladro"", nonchè dovrebbe cadere il principio della colpevolezza, reintroducendo una forma di responsabilità oggettiva (presente nel codice del '30 ma disintegrata dalle numerose pronunce della consulta), e in base a tale responsabilità oggettiva verso chi si mette contro l'ordinamento (dovrebbe cadere anche il principio di determinatezza della fattispecie penale) si dovrebbe automaticamente presumere in maniera ASSOLUTA la adeguata proporzionalità di qualsiasi reazione, nonchè la necessarietà; in pratica dovrebbe cadere il principio di legalità quasi in toto.

Tali principi enunciati sono stati riconosciuti come ""controlimiti"" dell'ordinamento costituzionale italiano (vedi sentenza taricchio e risposta della consulta, su un corollario del principio di legalità); cosa vuol dire controlimiti?   Vuol dire principi inderogabili, inalienabili, ma soprattutto immodificabili.

Questo vuol dire che non è possibile derogare o modificare tali principi, che fungono da limiti impliciti alla revisione costituzionale neanche con la procedura aggrava e l'iter dell'art 138 della costituzione, perchè superiori anche alle fonti di rango costituzionale.

La risposta alla tua domanda è pertanto la seguente: L'unico evento che potrebbe modificare così profondamente l'ordinamento Italiano per renderlo compatibile con la depenalizzazione del fatto da te descritto è una rivoluzione violenta che causi la fine dell'ordinamento attuale e lo sostituisca con un altro, privo dei suddetti controlimiti, che ammetta discriminazioni, responsabilità oggettiva e analogia interpretativa, nonchè eventualmente tribunali speciali a seconda dello status dei cittadini coinvolti.

Tali controlimiti sono una particolarità dell'o.g. italiano che rendono la nostra costituzione probabilmente la più rigida esistente.

Se prendiamo un paese come la Germania, seppur con uscita dall'eu, dalle convenzioni (vedi Cedu in primis), e una modifica della costituzione, sarebbe possibile conformare l'ordinamento senza doverlo sostituire in pieno.

Sinceramente non sono a conoscenza di paese civilizzati dove sia applicata la piena depenalizzazione, ma sicuramente alcuni paesi permettono una dilatazione dell'immediatezza della reazione (anticipandola e/o posticipandola) più diverse presunzioni di proporzionalità che possono avvicinarsi (ma non incarnare appieno) la tua visione.",True,0,1514934052,,1514934249,0,ds3nx13,False,t3_7nh7ze,t1_ds3cw11,/r/italy/comments/7nh7ze/accesso_facile_alle_armi_cosa_ne_pensi/ds3nx13/,1517503033,1,False,italy,t5_2qkhk,public,

They immensely helped bring Moon Jae-in to power.

Japan 

Gen Z/Youth among Japan are not only politically disengaged but disproportionately more supportive of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and Abe's military expansion than older voters

Poland

The youngest voters supported Paweł Kukiz - it results from exit poll research conducted by the Ipsos center for TVP. Among Poles, up to 29 years old, Kukiz gained 41.1 percent support

As the survey also proves, young women offer less support to radical parties and have less radical and more centrist views than men. Still, both Kukiz and Korwin-Mikke win among them anyway. 35% of young men would choose Kukiz, and 20% women. Much less, but still the most. More shocking is that despite the above mentioned sexist views declared by Korwin-Mikke, 14% of young women (as opposed to 25% young men) would give him their vote.

Conducted by the Institute of Public Affairs and pollster Kantar Public, the survey found Polish youths are significantly more likely to describe themselves as right wing than left wing. According to the data, 68 per cent of 15-24-year-olds described their political views as conservative while 30 per cent said they were on the left.

Kukiz’15 enjoys the strongest support among young voters according to the study, with 27 per cent of those surveyed saying they would vote for the right wing, anti-establishment party.

China

China's youth are the least nationalistic and jingoistic generation in China ever. University students are at a low for communist party support, most identify as Capitalist-liberal

Beijing youth in particular are seen as overtly optimistic and pacifist. 

They're also the most religous demographic there by a lot

They still put zero value in western interpretations of freedom and liberty but most want to copy America's electoral system more than Europe's. 

They also prefer America and Americans to Europeans and Russians, 100% opposite of any group pre 90s/mid 80s.

Hungary

An Hungarian survey by some Hungarian think-tank discovered almost 40% of Hungarian youth have no plans to stay in the country - The highest migration potential characterizes students who refer to themselves as liberal, left-wing and specifically, with pro-European inclinations,
who are dissatisfied with the current system, and who perceived a democratic deficit even in the very potentials of replacing the government or the freedom to
criticize it. With 63% of these demographics expressing zero-interest in staying in Hungary 

Among Hungarian youth 40% support The Jobbik, LMP-Green's 20%, Orban's cult also gets 20%

Jobbik’s voter base is mainly defined by male students in undergraduate programs whose parents had no college/university education and are religious on their own
terms. To a larger extent, LMP voters tend to be female, non-religious, from highly qualified urban families, pursuing MA or PHD degrees. The most characteristic traits of Fidesz-voting students include being religious, feeling more secure concerning the future; many attend undivided university programs (i.e. Law School and Medical School). Left-leaning students are less religious; more often have highly educated
parents, and are mostly female with origins in major cities. 

On the other hand, support for Jobbik
and LMP grew significantly: the latter was able to garner protest votes especially in major cities and the capital, whereas the former managed to pull off this feat almost everywhere else

Indonesia

Indonesia. Y

Almost 60 per cent admitted to having ""radical"" religious attitudes. Asked if they were intolerant of minorities, more than half said yes, with mainstream Muslims not only drawing lines between themselves and non-Muslims, but also against other Muslim minority communities such as the Shi'ite and Ahmadiyah.

Almost a third had no problems with intolerant acts committed by others against minorities, while almost 90 per cent said the government should ban heretical groups.

The other survey by polling firm Alvara involved more than 4,200 Muslim students, mostly from top schools and universities in Java, the island where half of Indonesia's population live and work. It found that nearly one in four students, to varying degrees, was ready to fight to establish an Islamic caliphate

65 per cent of respondents were uncomfortable with Chinese Indonesians ever having any government position

Jakarta-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), reveals a strong lean towards xenophobia, with 47.8% of millennial respondents believing that foreign companies have a negative impact on Indonesia’s economy.

Enlightenedbri,m2,Mystel,"Game is indeed pve oriented. Pvp is kinda limited to a daily battleground on a rotating event, and the weekly Civil Unrest guild vs guild. 

End game pve is basically farming 5 people dungeons. There are 8 dungeons, some have 2 levels of difficulty. The dungeons are divided in 3 groups based on difficulty. I’ll give you the names in case you want to check some youtube video or something. 

The low tier are braindead: Ravenous Gorge, Kalivan’s Challenge, and Shattered Fleet. 

Mid tier are Lilith’s Keep, Kalivan’s Dreadnaught (slightly harder than Kalivan’s Challenge), and Thaumetal Refinery. 

Hard tier are: RK-9 Kennel, Sky Cruisier, Lilith’s Keep Hard, Thaumetal Refinery Hard, and Broken Prison. 

Then there is the highest tier with RK-9 Hard, and RK-9 Extreme were the last boss is much harder. Event dungeons also go here. 

There’s also a 20 people raid for hardcores, Harrowhold. 4 phases. Weekly reset. Big ass dragon. 

We get some new dungeons and old dungeons coming back every 4-6 months or so. 

In between patches we often get 1 additional dungeon focused on boss mechanics, like Manglemire or Demon’s Wheel. This time that would be Broken Prison making a comeback with some new mechanics. 

Sometimes there are also event dungeons which are extremely hard and require good gear. Like Sky Cuisier Exteme mode. Europe now has Dreadspire Upper Floors Extreme mode, a revamp of Dreadspire, even harder.

You need to read up on it. Di Stefano was owned by two sides, Barca negotiated with River Plate, Real with Millonarios. Barca refused to pay Millionarios and that caused a stalemate. Real tried to sign him, it all became a very public battle, and the regime had to step in due to the embarrassment it was causing them. Their attempts to mediate were clearly designed to not favour either side. First they banned all foreign players, essentially saying neither of you can have him, but then when that proved unworkable, made the suggestion for each of them to have him for a year, after which Barca pulled out. It comes down to them not understanding football more than anything.

The Spanish federation also warned Real off the signing of Kubala, as he was considered a defector by Hungary, but Barcelona were able to nip in and get him.

The West coast would probably ban together and immediately enter the Top 10 World Economies.

New York State's GDP alone is greater than that of Australia and is close to that of Russia's or Canada's. 

I really don't see Canada doing much since their population is focused around the seaboards which would have an easier time going their own routes instead of joining Canada.

The East coast would probably still have a large amount of diplomatic ties especially if the NYSE is still running due to the implications of starting trouble. Not to mention the East Cost is closer to the European powers and Canada's capital.

shallowm,,أمير المتوحدين,"
The elimination of the ""white"" race is inevitable. In fact, race is, for the most part, a nonsense construct, but the ""white"" race even moreso. It is clear that there is no explicit, accurate definition for being ""white"", the phantasm of ""race purity"" is far from reality and is grounded in nothing but the fantasies of people who think that those that they do not consider ""white"" are ""taking muh womenz"" (read: insecurity, as well as misogyny).

In present-day society, the identity of Western countries and their inhabitants are not pegged down by race, but by nationality—additionally, you can now see people mixing their origins with their current nationality, an example being so called ""hyphenated Americans"". These people range from someone holding some aspects of their culture dear to them, to someone who calls themselves so because ""my [insert near ancestor] was from [insert foreign country]"". Contrary to the European failure at integrating immigrants, the United States has done well with the integration of immigrants, and miscegenation of races will thus be unavoidable, and the delusion of ""white purity"" will become extinct.

Even in Europe, although they may not have succeeded in integrating their immigrants well (leading to the formation of ghettos such as the ones in Tower Hamlets, London), there will always be a few immigrants who manage to escape from the grasps of these ghettos and integrate within larger society. This leads to race-mixing as well, albeit to a lesser extent, but every bit counts, and every bit helps. Why? When two people of color have children, you can usually see distinct features from both parents present in the child. When a person of color and a white person have a child, the most commonly (and usually only) feature passed down from the white parent is lighter skin (cumskin). This is due to the fact that the genes that lead to the expression of so-called ""white"" phenotypes, are for the most part, recessive. This facilitates the elimination of ""white"" features in society.

Furthermore, children who have blood from both a person of color and a white person are forsaken by those who fantasize about the white race being preserved, even though they carry recessive genes from their white parent, genes that could eventually be expressed again. This will also contribute to the demise of the so-called ""white race"".

Eventually, no person who considers themselves ""white"" will have so-called ""pure"" genes. Hence, the white race will have been eliminated by the standards set by the race purists themselves, having led themselves to their own demise.

bvndwidth,flag1,,"**Review #13**

*Elijah Craig Barrel Proof Batch 12*

The above picture is not mine, I almost always take one, but I suppose I forgot.

This was a 2 oz sample from a swap with /u/brenttw. Rested neat in a glencairn for 10 minutes

**Distillery**:  Elijah Craig is a Heaven Hill product made from their 75% corn, 13% rye, 12% malted barley mashbill. This is batch #12, the last of the old bottle design. 

**Age**:  12 Years

**Color**: 1.5 [Auburn](http://malt-review.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colour-bar-Big.jpg)

**Proof**: 136

**Nose**:  Dense rose petals, ethanol, dark red cherries, butterscotch candy, funky &amp; distinctly smokey.

**Taste**: Incredibly hot, but at 136 proof I would be surprised if it didn’t have some heat to it. Dark red cherries, heavy smoked oak flavors, this tastes like a bourbon finished in JW Black Label casks (I’m pretty sure that’s not how scotch works, but you get the idea).

**Mouthfeel**: Medium-thin, warm cheek tingle, followed by a full-on assault of flavor and heat.

**Legs**:  Another high proof bourbon, another halo, another lack of legs.

**Finish**:  Spicy red cherries, more smoked oak, followed by artificial green apple jolly ranchers.
 
**Final Thoughts:** Wow, this is a pretty interesting whiskey, it’s definitely the Elijah Craig profile I know and love, but with a heavy cherry flavor that overshadows the regular sweetness I was expecting. This is regular EC’s fire-red-dyed-hair European cousin who speaks with a thick accent. The finish is long, and intense. In my opinion too hot, I ended up splashing in some water to tame it, and it ended up tasting like a sherry finished bourbon. If this wasn’t so unenjoyably hot, it’d be a point higher on my scale  

*Ratings do not factor in cost*

**Rating: 6**

Arbitrary Scale

1. Slightly more potable than paint thinner
2. The ""Steel Reserve"" of whiskey 
3. Gifts for people who you don't like
4. Mix with various sodas
5. Decent, dynamic, good for most things. The type 
of whiskey that would call its mother more. 
6. ""How much of this am I allowed to drink?""
7. ""Daily Sipper"" territory
8. ""Don't pour more than one glass asshole, I'm 
trying to save that bottle""
9. Shit you pull out to impress people who actually 
drink whiskey A.K.A. The I-drink-whiskey, whiskey.

Germania (Latin: [ɡɛrˈmaː.ni.a]; modern English ) was the Roman term for the geographical region in north-central Europe inhabited mainly by Germanic peoples.

It extended from the Danube in the south to the Baltic Sea, and from the Rhine in the west to the Vistula. The Roman portions formed two provinces of the Empire, Germania Inferior to the north (present-day Netherlands, Belgium, and western Germany), and Germania Superior to the south (Switzerland, southwestern Germany, and eastern France).

Germania was inhabited mostly by Germanic tribes, but also Celts, Balts, Scythians and later on Early Slavs.

They planned to create a ethnic state without considering the indigenous voice. 48 was just the culmination of the project to create a state in land they dont have any legitimate claim. Zionist was the invaders and the threat to the peace. The 48 split plan was just taking Arab land without asking the majority of population opinion and create a new country that zionist planned for decades. 

Arab had thousand reason to be against this plan and to try prevent it. Just look history of the region...(from ottoman domination to the creation of Israël through european colonization)

I agree with you that there's no scientific evidence showing any negative health outcomes from GMO's, yet. It's a contentious issue and half of the EU feels the same way as Russia. And considering that most GMO's are made to tolerate various herbicides, poisons, and fertilizers, maybe some people just aren't into putting that shit into their bodies. I know I'm not.

So... banning GMO's is progressive *in my opinion*. I prefer my food the natural way, and so do many other people apparently.

Kalanan,,,"&gt; I'm not sure I follow your logic. Are you arguing that a procedure that reduces risk by 60% shouldn't be done because it's not 100%? Or that circumcision should be done to more men, instead of on a subset as it is now? Or are you arguing it is not effective, despite mass circumcision being a recent phenomenon?

You are thinking that what happen in Africa will give you 60 % less HIV infected people in the US. Or at least some impact. Except it does not, despite having 60 % of the male population circumcised. The us still have around 0.4 % prevalence like the EU where circumcision is rare.
By the way circumcision and the pandemics of HIV are roughly at the same time for the US, I would say it even predates it by one or two decades.

Edit : I was about right, by 1950 50% of the population was circumcised while the epidemics is widely known to have started in the seventies.

&gt; The failure of HIV prevention? What?

the failure to see the context of the US as the AAP seems to have done.

&gt; I just talked about the tension between bodily autonomy and medical necessity.

Circumcision cannot be considered a medical necessity in the US. Not by a sane person knowing the stats. The prevalence is only 0.4 %, and especially among gays.

&gt; We have medical ethics boards. I reject the notion circumcision is too hot potato for them.

Ethics boards don't legislate. To enable a bill to ban male mutilation is a very complicated process right now, with an important chance of alienating religious voter.

Turkey is a strategic target for Russia, warm water ports far better than the terrible one in Syria and the Bosphorus is vital to Russia’s interests. If Turkey were to move towards Russia then Turkish politics would be taken over by Russian shills - look at Ukraine. It’s in the better economic interest for turkey to work with Europe?

Russia isn’t looking for a Turkish partner, it’s looking for a puppet with nice geography that can be useful to hurt the west. What happens will happen to the interests and lives of the Turkish people. Turks think they’re hurting the US by moving toward Russia but I can tell you not a single person in the US feels turkeys alliance today and none will feel turkey leaving tomorrow, but everyone in turkey will feel it the second they move into Russia’s sphere. 

NATO protects turkey from Russia and the Arabs, NATO keeps turkey western as much as possible and allows Turks to do business with Western Europe (a huge source of GDP). Is it possible to exists as good as today or better without NATO? Yes, but it’s much much more difficult...and I don’t believe turkey is currently capable of pulling this off. Instead turkey will become a Russian punching bag (like Ukraine, Georgia, Syria, Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, and all of Central Asia). 

Of course the super wealthy will do fine in every case and the ultra poor will suffer just the same as before too, but the rest of turkey will feel a lot of hurt leaving NATO and the West.

ExplodedWeevil3,,[sNs],"Hello Brok,

I hope you would consider joining Soldiers Never Sleep (sNs). We are an international clan founded in the U.K. back in 2011. We have members in nearly every timezone with about atleast 40 active players on daily and another 100 players on at varying times. Therefore, you will not be left out as a result of sheer size. We have members on just about all times of the day, EU or NA. We'd be happy to have you as a member, so you can get to know the guys.

Although I know you are looking for a server, I would recommend finding a group *first* and then find a server. Based on your preferences for a server, that shouldn't be hard to find at all... Anyways, we do host private events on private servers weekly or bi-weekly. Therefore, if that's what you mean, you won't be without at sNs either. Let me know what you think!

Please check us out at snsclan.com. You can also join us on Discord, a messaging app, to meet some members and hook up with players for games. We discuss things there throughout the day in addition to organizing events. You may also apply, if you'd like, at snsclan.com. This application just gives us your information to match you with players closest to you thereby reducing latency for you.

Thank you for your time. I hope to speak to you soon!

What, you think one of the most appreciated actors in star wars saying bad things about it openly is going to go unnoticed when it's just releasing?

BackTo1975,,,"Palpatine was already focused entirely on blasting Luke there and it seems like a lot of Force energy was being used. It's also unknown how strong Palpatine even was at that point, because he sure seems hobbled. I think there's references in old EU canon to him being drained, to be very old and not as strong as he could have been at that part of his life. He was definitely doing something with those dark side acolytes hanging around him, too, and when you tie in the quest for immortality referred to later by the PT, it's not difficult to see how this scene played out. Also, Vader was powerful, even wounded like that, and had huge physical strength with the Force and the suit. I never thought it seemed unbelievable that he took out Palpatine there.

And there were limits to the humour in the OT and even the PT. TLJ tossed that all out the window and threw in the terribly cheesy jokes in moments that should have been played straight. Like the Luke stuff about Rey feeling the Force when he was ticking her hand with that feather. The guy's supposed to be suicidal, down on everything, but he's still doing bits? Same with the Yoda speech where Yoda chides him for not actually reading the Jedi texts because they aren't page-turners.

Come on. We're talking about a guy who's basically come to the conclusion that his entire life has been a failure and enters the movie about to complete the last ritual to end the Jedi (pretty clear he's at least strongly considering to off himself when Rey arrives). But he's still yukking it up?

The tone was way off in too many moments in TLJ. Nothing was off limits to a bit or a corny line. The OT just didn't do this. Otherwise we'd have had Luke making jokes when he met with Vader and the Emperor. Leia making a crack to Tarkin before he blew up Alderaan. And so on. It was too meta, too forced, and way too much of a wink to the audience to not take all this stuff too seriously. It was also a pretty self-conscious effort to mimic the Marvel tone that's now in all of the MCU movies.",True,0,1514950976,,False,0,ds42kq0,False,t3_7npcjr,t1_ds3u5yc,/r/StarWars/comments/7npcjr/the_movie_we_need/ds42kq0/,1517511030,5,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,public,

speedyspaghetti,,,"Hey - welcome!  
  
J.A. Henckels has a really wide range of quality - where are the knives made? It should say on the blade near the bolster. Their cheaper ones are made in Thailand and China, while their more expensive ones are made in Germany. Middle of the road ones might be made in Spain.  
  
Depending on where they are made, the European made ones are solid knives. They might not be as good as a knife from a lesser known Japanese maker with better steel, but they are definitely good enough for almost any home cook.  
  
In order to keep them sharp, I would highly suggest either investing in a set of Japanese wetstones or paying to have them professionally sharpened. The King brand stones on Amazon are of decent quality for the price - you'll probably want a 1000 grit and a 3000+ grit one as well. If the knife gets chipped or really dull, you might want something like a 220 grit, but as long as you're careful with the knives, 1000 grit is usually a good starting point.  
  
I would highly NOT recommend a pull through sharpener such as [this one.](https://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/wusthof-ikon-manual-knife-sharpener/?catalogId=50&amp;sku=6193564&amp;cm_ven=PLA&amp;cm_cat=Google&amp;cm_pla=Cutlery%20%3E%20Knife%20Sharpeners%20%3E%20Manual&amp;kwid=productads-adid^225632026782-device^c-plaid^368476279136-sku^6193564-adType^PLA&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA-KzSBRAnEiwAkmQ15w-h6yWa98r7wTDPbmfKQpX6p7no6iHyKMD50mtRzkgulFXjCml1XBoCy3oQAvD_BwE&amp;cm_ite=[[PLA]%20-%20NB%20Desk/Tab])  
  
There are plenty of local sharpening services in most places costing anywhere from $5-10 per knife.  
  
Honing with a honing steel is different than sharpening, and does not replace it. There are many discussions around the merits of honing - I personally hone some of my knives, but this does more for keeping the blade straight, rather than sharp.  
  
Let me know if there is anything confusing in here or that you would like more information on.

ooo-ooo-oooyea,,,"Well you made me laugh my ass off.  

My horror story.  The first time I went to Europe was on a ""school"" trip.  Basically pay $700 and you get to go to Europe for 10 days, a total awesome deal!  Well a few days before the trip I get ill, but I power through it because, um I get to go to Europe.  

So we arrive in Madrid, we have dinner, all is well.  The next day I'm feeling pretty shitty but wow, I'm in freaking Madrid, we need to see stuff!  So we arrive at some sort of Royal Palace, and I start to feel my illness coming back.  We are in a room with ornate oriental rugs, and I start vomiting...  my dad (who was a chaperone... lucky guy) tries catching the vomit in his hat.... but that did no good.  A guard sees what is happening and chases us out of the palace, where we had to wait until the other people finished the tour.  

I had to skip the trip to Toledo, and was in pretty shitty shape the next few days.  The good news is I recovered, only to get caught in a wave in Italy and hurt myself on some rocks and bled everywhere.  

My big lesson from that trip is I really, really, hate bus tours... that and pay attention to my body and my surroundings.  ",True,0,1514951977,,False,0,ds43dh2,False,t3_7npin8,t3_7npin8,/r/travel/comments/7npin8/embarrassing_travel_stories/ds43dh2/,1517511460,7,False,travel,t5_2qh41,public,

quinson93,,,"What about Asia? China (and the countries that made up it) were for nearly two thousand years the most knowledgeable and wealthy body on the planet. The Qing Manchu dynasty even refereed to Europe as a small island when Europe tried to initiate trade, and not even the Mongolians were interested in conquering the land because of its poverty and bareness (***edit*** didn't stop them from contracting the black pledge though). The wealth Europe enjoys is without a doubt a result from old European colonization of Asia, initiated by warfare and drug trade (grown in India).

If this is what you mean by thousands of years of ""superior"" history, I'd suggest you find a better contrast than Africa. This just seems like low hanging fruit, especially when you blatantly ignore the primary powers of the world.
