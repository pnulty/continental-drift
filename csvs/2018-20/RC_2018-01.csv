I love the Star Wars lore much beyond that of the movies. Whereas with MCU and comics I never felt attachment towards it much outside of Spider-Man.

Star Wars to me is fascinating reason about the previous Sith Lords, the balance of the force, perspective of the light side, gray Jedi, and so on. I get the movies set the actual plot but what the EU did before Disney was remarkable.

No, I don't agree. Certainly in the last year this has been primarily framed around Britain leaving the EU and therefore being racist.

The total lack of comprehension of those people that almost every country in The EU is a worse place to be an ethnic minority than the UK doesn't mean they aren't attempting to make a relative comparison. They just don't know much or have a romanticised picture about these countries they claim to love.

During the two previous seasons Morata, Isco and James were there probably trying as hard they could in training in order to get more playing time which was pushing others as well.

Now there is not such quality depth, but then again when the likes of Kroos or Modrić are underperfoming why not give Dani Ceballos a chance? The times he's played I've heard he's done well. His brace even won a match for you guys in La Liga when everybody else were struggling. 

But yeah Benzema is the guy who plays a lot for Cristiano and doesn't score so much himself. Now when Cristiano isn't playing well either then the duo is suffering and it's no wonder that nobody up front is scoring the goals. 

Obviously it's easy to say it now, but Real Madrid should've gone all in for Mbappé in the summer. The guy is something else. The problem was apparently him not getting promised that he'd always be playing + other senior players having an issue with such a young guy getting paid so much..

dboeren,,,"&gt; I was thinking those were ribbon spools. I imagine having those be internal would also help with portability if one is clumsy...

Many machines with visible spools have covers for them, typically with some sort of friction-fit (whether around the perimeter or on a center post) so turning the machine upside down won't necessarily cause the spools to fall off.  However, the covers are sometimes lost over the years.


&gt; Do you know if the SM3 has the cursive font like the SM4?

It's on an individual basis, when you ordered/bought your typewriter you could choose from a catalog of different fonts offered for that model.  The most common were Pica (10 characters per inch) and Elite (12 characters per inch) both in a fairly normal serif style.  A machine with a cursive, italic, or other unusual font was probably a special order.  You could order machines with certain special characters too, for instance you might see a typewriter with special math keys, or foreign language letters.  Anyway, you'd need to look at that specific typewriter.  The sellers usually don't mention it or know to look for it.  You can sort of tell if there's a clear enough picture of the slugs, or you can ask them to type something and send a picture of the writing.  This both reveals the font and helps verify that it works enough to produce text.  However, if you tip them off that their machine has a rare font they might try to ask for more money :)

&gt; The Royal Quiet Deluxe's sure are cute!

I like them too, and the Royal Aristocrat is very similar.  I can see some people might find them ""boxy"" but I think they look pretty sharp.  I especially like the ones with the ""tombstone"" shaped keys

&gt; Can ask what styles or types you personally enjoy?

I've only been collecting a little while so my collection isn't that big yet.  I think my favorite is my Royal #10.  Very snappy typer and I love the glass windows on the sides.  I find myself drawn to interesting mechanisms, like how some of the Remingtons had gears on each type bar instead of doing it all with levers or their Noiseless typewriters.  I really like the look of the L.C. Smith #8 and in general a lot of the old open looking standards.  Olivers are really cool too, I have one but it's in pretty bad shape.  I generally don't like too much of the 60's and later stuff, 20s-40's seem to be my sweet spot.  I also don't mind the larger size and weight of standard machines (as opposed to portables).

Some things I'm on the lookout for are the L.C. Smith #8 (I really like the profile and openness of these), Underwood #5, Remington Portable #1, Woodstock #5, Remington #6, Royal Quiet Deluxe, Royal KMM, Smith Corona 3 (folding) and I'd like to pick up a couple European machines like the Olympia SM3/4, Optima, Hermes, and Olivetti.  I'd also love to get a nice Hammond Multiplex with multiple font elements but that's going to be tricky and costly.

&gt; This is so exciting!

I'm finding that the hunt is part of the fun.  Also, every typewriter has its own personality and cleaning up an old beater yourself and getting it working again for the first time in decades can be more fun than just buying something that is already in great shape.",True,0,1514779376,,False,0,ds0x9a5,False,t3_7mvfpm,t1_ds0r22u,/r/typewriters/comments/7mvfpm/what_do_you_use_your_typewriter_for_favorite/ds0x9a5/,1517443633,1,False,typewriters,t5_2s5on,public,

 I've read into this a little but it was for when the localization was done by the Treehouse with Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance for the GC back in 2005. Maybe the localization philosophies have changed from then, but they tried to be very faithful to the literal translation. When they couldn't be for one reason or another, they would contact Intelligent Systems and basically ask them ""when you say X thing, what are you trying to convey?"" They would then come up with ideas to capture that same idea and then ask IS if they could make the change. Down to everything like name changes they would consult if they wanted to change them to make sure they weren't ruining what the Dev team created.

If you disagree with the name changes, I'm not saying you can't feel that way.

Yes, many of the First Nations people I know like to be called by the name of their more immediate group... that is not the discussion here. The discussion is about the preferred name for the broader group.

They have **tremendous** power, but cannot interfere with free will, nor can they directly act unless it's in line with the will of another, or unless something darker makes a move first.

For an example, if a sith ghost of palpatine (It happened in the EU I think) were to show up and start influencing Kylo Ren, Yoda may be allowed to step in to balance it out and allow Kylo his free will.

If an army of force ghosts were to fight the battles of the resistance for the resistance, the resistance wouldn't have actually done anything. 

Take Obi-Wan for example. As a force ghost, he may have helped Luke guide those famous torpedoes into the Death Star, because he was acting in time with Luke's free will.

So Yoda was able to talk to Luke regarding the tree, and burn it, as Luke simply needed help expressing his own free will in that decision.

 ______ 
**The enduring legend of a Spanish dancer who became an Indian queen** 

 ______ 
In the first painting the woman is reclined on a sofa, an olive-green sari
wrapped snug across her body, her face framed by the hood of a pallu. In the
adjacent painting the same woman is crowned by a diadem, standing tall and
statuesque in a pale, low-cut dress. These portraits of Anita Delgado, one of
the city’s most famous natives, now hang in the Museo de Malaga, where Andres
Cabrera has suggested a stopover.

Before coming here this afternoon, Cabrera, 51, a city guide in Malaga, sighed
heavily as he narrated the beguiling story of Delgado, a poor Spanish flamenco
dancer who became an Indian royal in the first half of the 20th century. “The
Maharaja of Kapurthala saw her and fell in love with her,” said Cabrera, a
tall, bearded man pronouncing “maharaha” by interchanging the “j” and “h”,
Spanish-style. “Imagine, a simple of girl became a Maharani.”

Jagatjit Singh was an already-married 34-year-old king with a passion for all
things French when he visited Madrid for a royal wedding in 1906. Mesmerized
after watching a nightclub performance featuring the then 16-year-old Delgado,
he pursued her and had her educated in Paris and Brussels. They got married in
1907 and the following year he triumphantly returned to the small Punjabi
kingdom of Kapurthala with a new wife—his fifth and allegedly his favourite. A
Sikh ceremony followed and Anita Delgado became Maharani Prem Kaur.

She was suddenly thrust from an ordinary existence into an orbit of wealth,
power and status in an exotic foreign land. And as the captions alongside the
gallery’s portraits indicate, the good life included “jaunts to Europe” when
she commissioned “fashionable painters” to paint her.

Though it may be barely known or remembered in India, it’s a tale that inheres
in Malaga, a seaside Spanish town once ruled for centuries by the Arabs and
later conquered by Catholic kings. “At a time like that, a woman left and went
to another faraway country,” said Montse Ogalla, 52, a local filmmaker. With a
shudder of excitement, she added: “she was a woman, having an adventure!”

People like Ogalla heard the story by word of mouth, but over time it began to
recede. In the past two decades following half a dozen books, and the
possibility of a film, it has definitively moved from localized legend into
national attention.

_Passion India_, by Spanish writer Javier Moro, was published in 2005, a
historical fiction that mounted imagined dialogue on the bedrock of two years
of research. It tore up the charts. The tale contained everything: class
climbing, a Pygmalion-esque makeover, palace decadence, culture shock and
later rumours of infidelity. It practically wrote itself.

As a boy, Javier Moro recalled his grandmother remarking by way of shorthand,
that so and so was “wealthier than the Maharaja of Kapurthala”. “When they
talked about wealthy people they used to say [that],” he said, on the phone
from Madrid. “It was a Spanish saying, you see.” He didn’t think much of it
until he met a distant cousin of the Maharaja during a research trip to Bhopal
in the nineties. The ensuing conversation convinced him he had tapped a rich
narrative vein.

But after completing _Passion India_, Moro was all set to give up writing and
open a modern bakery. He had a growing family to support and bread offered the
possibility of a steadier income than books, given that he expected this one
to sell about 30,000 copies. It eventually went on to sell more than one and a
half million, was reprinted 50 times and translated into a dozen languages.
“So goodbye to my dream of becoming a baker,” he said. “I have to wait for my
next life.”

Still, he wasn’t the first to sink his fangs into this romantic drama. In 1998
the writer Elisa Vázquez de Gey had already published _Anita Delgado: Maharani
of Kapurthala_, an authorized biography drawing on a stash of private papers
and letters given by Delgado’s niece. Interest surged and following reader
questions she returned with two more books in 2005 and 2008. This year she
translated Delgado’s original French diaries into Spanish. The interest in the
dancer had become ever-green.

“The historical backdrops of her life fascinate the reader: the splendour of
the world of the Maharajas, Spain at the beginning of the 20th century, Paris
during the Belle Époque, both World Wars and the independence of India,” said
de Gey, who functions as the official preserver of her memory, by email. “You
have to imagine, she was a teenage girl from Andalusia, without much culture,
who within just a few months goes from dancing in a vaudeville act to
performing the functions of a princess in a far off country.”

For his part, Moro struggled to grasp why _Passion India _left women across
Europe swooning. “Listen, for me it’s a bit of a mystery and I was surprised
it was such a hit,” he said with disarming candour. He ventured a guess, all
the same. “I think basically it touches an archetype of the little girl who
has an opportunity to meet a prince,” he said. “I mean you know, who doesn’t
want to marry a prince?”

But as someone who has cultivated a body of work writing dramatized reality-
based accounts—including the controversial, Sonia Gandhi-centred _The Red
Sari_—that wasn’t all it was. “It was very unique to be able to tell the story
of the end of the Raj and of the last maharajas of India through the point of
view of a Spaniard,” he said.

He was one of the speakers at a day-long conference in Madrid in October
centred on Delgado, where her granddaughter also spoke. The 250-seater
auditorium was full to capacity and largely comprised women. “Somehow this
character fascinates women,” said Moro. “It has touched a chord in the female
psyche somewhere.”

The seminar was hosted by the women’s group Circulo Orellana as part of its
efforts to revisit trail-blazing Spanish women. “We try to organize such
programmes for the purpose of collective memory and to put their lives in
perspective, to recognize their work and their values,” said Leticid Espinosa
De Los Monteros,the Circle’s president. “It is not easy to go to another
place, another culture, another life,” she continued. “It requires courage.”

De Gey explored some of these dimensions, seeking to imbue her narrative with
an agency that popular memory had perhaps denied her. Delgado lived between
two religions, spoke five languages, travelled the world and even helped with
First World War efforts, by organizing winter wear for Kapurthala troops and
creating a relief fund for widows and orphans.

Everyone agrees her story was extraordinary, but dispute has dogged some of
the details. In Moro’s account she had an affair with one of her step-sons and
was banished to Europe to eke out the rest of her days. De Gey on the other
hand claims she carried out her duties as Rani “with serenity and discretion”
and “when the distance between her and her husband became insurmountable they
both decided that she would return to Europe”.

In any case, after 18 years in India, and having a son with the Maharaja,
Delgado moved back (there was no official divorce) and died in Madrid in 1962
where she is buried. Her son, Ajit Singh, arranged for royal emblems to be
placed on her tomb: a crown of a Sikh dagger and a crucifix.

Moro’s book evoked sharp reactions from one of the Maharaja’s descendants in
India—Tikka Shatrujit Singh threatened to sue him and said that the book had
presented a “scandalous portrayal”. A grand nephew of Delgado, Manuel Lucas
Sanchis, also wrote an open letter saying the book contained “a great number
of errors, frivolities and mediocrities intended only to provide a more
saleable image to the protagonist and her world”.

Delgado’s only son Ajit died in the 1980s, and Kim Akhtar, a daughter he
allegedly had through a brief affair, later returned with her own book, _The
Maharani’s Hidden Granddaughter_. (Despite repeated efforts, neither Singh nor
Akhtar could be reached for comment for this story.)

All the same, the legend of Delgado never quite caught on in India, as it did
elsewhere. “Well she was a minor character and spouse of a minor maharaja,”
said Moro.“Kapurthala was not a biggie.”

Abroad though, interest in the saga was triggered afresh when some of her
jewels were put up for auction in 2007 by Christie’s in the UK. Talks of a
film have continued to circulate in the ether. Rights for two of de Gey’s
three books have been sold. At one point Penelope Cruz held the rights to
_Passion India _and was to play Delgado. Now Shekhar Kapur has shown interest
in filming it as a mini-series, according to Moro.

Whether or not she is immortalized on screen, Delgado continues to animate the
Spanish imagination. One autumn evening a group of women from Malaga joined in

They aren't just trying to send a message to the US but to other countries as well, maybe signalling to some hardheaded and stuffy politicians that they need to reorient their foreign policy and work together to pick up the slack that we've left off.

As far as the European sphere goes, I wouldn't blame them for that assessment. We've basically stopped participating in world affairs that aren't related to ISIS and North Korea, the president has a negative view of the global economy and globalism as an idea, we're going to ignore the climate for at least four years, and it definitely seems like they're on their own as far as containing Russia goes.

As for proper -international banks- they tend to all do remote openings and everything is conducted online, which is amazing. BUT if you happen to be in the UK, most specifically London, anytime soon. It's always easier to start your relationship in person plus you save all the money from the documents attestation and courier fees which if is a few docs, will certainly be a few hundred dollars. Nothing beats face 2 face. Once you are in, absolutely all of it is online.

I've used Lloyds and Standard fee-less for years, so your dream is not impossible ;)

In Sing. not all banks require 50K unless my information is old, Citibank requires 200K and it used to be only 10K years ago, but those days are gone unfortunately.

Thailand is a jurisdiction where I wouldn't leave money parked, OK for small sums but =... too much turmoil, feels like currency controls are always around the corner.

The places in Asia I'm thinking are more remote, Federal territory of Labuan, Hong Kong, Macau? I'm willing to try even ""onshore"" Malaysia. Philippines is a nice place if you hold hard currencies. Their corrupt officials made it almost impossible to tell who owns the accounts.

African isles are... grey areas, in a sense the same as parts of the Caribbean, I believe Caribbean is better seen nowadays, but Seychelles or Mauritius are options. Yet I don't know how ""efficient/reliable"" their insurance will be.

You still have lots of options available even in Europe, in order of transparency or compliance perception, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Malta, Estonia, Andorra, San Marino, Lithuania, Cyprus, and the worse of the worse but super opaque, Montenegro, The country that is not supposed to use euros but does anyways. many of this jurisdictions usually require higher minimums than the scope of this conversation, but it's a good list to keep in mind. You will certainly not aim to do anything in Liechtenstein apart from stop by by for a nice hot chocolate.


All the banks we discussed, as a matter of fact, most if not all international banks, offer accounts and services in most currency usual suspects, USD/GBP/EUR/CHF/JPY. Lists are usually longer and many times include norther European currencies, if banking in Asia you usually get regional ones too.

I know there's a lot to go through, but do your research and and you will find what you want. Have you though about the Middle east? Most specifically Bahrain or UAE? They will offer services in the currency pairs you are looking for but without debit cards as other banks.


That should be enough for this installment. Let us know if there's been any development.

I don't think the Ottoman Empire ever had any major European allies but the French and Polish-Lithuanians. The Venetians had to maintain positive relations with the Turks (until their ports were eventually seized and Veneto was annexed by the Habsburgs), and the Neapolitans (as well as the Papal State) fought alongside the Turks in the mess that were the Italian Wars.

(One might argue that the British were in some sense allies (with respect to the Crimean War and Great Eastern Crisis), or perhaps for the case of the Triple Alliance, but both of these cases are far out of EU4s timeframe.)

The problem of Ottoman-Ming/Bohemian/Russian -ish alliances in EU4, is that it showcases a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of alliances -- alliances are chiefly formed due to strategic interests (and are thereby short-term ad hoc diplomatic relations), but I really wouldn't want Paradox to try to acommodate for that, considering that their own take on strategic interests [is absolutely retarded](https://imgur.com/a/X4hnF#Fb2QXiI)

Ah, and now you dug your own argumentations hole.

While using something (i.e. fossil fuel combustion) we only looked at the primary dangers. Is carbondioxid dangerous? And we concluded, well if you air your garage properly you have nothing to worry about. Only lately we realize that carbondioxide even tho without any immediate dangers carry weightful longtime dangers.

Now interestingly we *know* about the immediate dangers of radiactivity - and pretty much have no recourse how to handle them. The amount of contaminated soil in Fukushima that can't be 'disposed' for instance.

But we give literally *no regards* towards any longtime dangers. Just one harmless effect - low-background steel. We need that for a lot of things. And Chernobyl is a good case study too - I don't mean ground zero, I mean the rest of Europe. How the different 'less dangerous' isotopes accumulated in fungi, plants and animals.

&gt; Motion City Soundtrack was a pop-punk band which includes members Joshua Cain (guitar), Justin Pierre (vocals/guitar), Jesse Johnson (Moog), Matthew Taylor (bass), and Claudio Rivera (drums). Following their high-school graduation, Minneapolis, MN natives Pierre and Cain -- both of whom were inspired by Sunny Day Real Estate, Jawbox, the Flaming Lips, and Superchunk -- formed the band in 1999. The pair assembled a temporary lineup and issued a self-released 7"" that same year. Later, while touring through Pennsylvania in support of their release, Motion City Soundtrack met Thaxton and Taylor of the Virginia-based band Submerge. The two musicians decided to leave their hometown of Richmond, VA, to join Motion City Soundtrack full-time, and the expanded band soon entered the studio with producer/engineer Ed Rose (the Get Up Kids, Ultimate Fakebook). Three weeks before recording commenced, they were also joined by keyboardist Jesse Johnson (whose personal record label, Ordinary Records, had issued some of Jimmy Eat World's earliest material in 1995) to relieve singer/guitarist Pierre of his synthesizer duties.

&gt; With a new lineup firmly in place, the band's punk-glazed debut, I Am the Movie, was released in the summer of 2003. While playing venues and basements in support of the album, Motion City Soundtrack was picked up by Epitaph Records; later, they joined blink-182 on a tour through Europe and Japan. Blink's bassist, Mark Hoppus, took a liking to the band and agreed to produce their next album; the resulting Commit This to Memory was released two years later and featured an increasingly pop-heavy sound. A deluxe version of the album (complete with bonus DVD) appeared in 2006, and the band spent the summer on Warped Tour before heading to Europe with OK Go that fall. Entering the studio for the third time, Motion City Soundtrack began to work with producers Adam Schlesinger (of Fountains of Wayne), Eli Janney (of Girls Against Boys), and Ric Ocasek (of the Cars). The completed product, Even If It Kills Me, was released in September 2007.

&gt; On January 19, 2010, Motion City Soundtrack released a new full length album entitled ""My Dinosaur Life"". 

&gt; In June of 2012, Motion City Soundtrack released it's 5th full-length album  Go. The album takes the classic clever lyrics and upbeat MCS that we all know and love in a new direction. Editorial Review: ""Returning to their longtime label Epitaph to release Go, Motion City Soundtrack present the most mature and developed album of their long career. Continuing a dichotomy between upbeat music and darker lyricism that stretches back to their breakout single 'The Future Freaks Me Out,'  Go sees the band both maturing lyrically and musically while reinvigorating the signature melodic, keyboard driven sound that their longtime fans love. Despite the full circle musical evolution they ve undergone with Go, the band members agree that in some ways they feel like the same way they did when Motion City Soundtrack was starting to make their mark in the early 2000s (source below)."" Drummer Tony Thaxton left the band in March 2013 and was replaced by Claudio Rivera. Thaxton rejoined the band for their ""So Long, Farewell"" tour in 2016. Read more on Last.fm.

Derp53,,,"&gt; Denial in this aspect is complacent with his racism. 

I'm going to prove you wrong here. 

&gt; His city ghetto segregates both Dunmer and Argonians, and the saying is ""give Skyrim back to the Nords"".

The city was configured like that before Ulfric even inherited the throne from his father. Ulfric doesn't do anything for or against the Dunmer or Argonians. In fact if you actually spent any significant amount of time in the city you'd notice the Dunmer usually segregate themselves. The Nord population is pretty much laissez faire about the racial composition of their city. 

You could point to Rolff but that's one encounter and one person in a mostly Nord city. When you actually look at the reality of the situation, you see Altmer (even though they make up the leadership of the Dominion) as the stable owners and apothecaries (outside of the jarl's wizard which really makes the most accessible and only pharmacy for the common man) and Niranye as a general goods merchant right alongside other Nord merchants in the Stone Quarter. None of them ever get any abuse for being Altmer. Furthermore, if you ever go to Assemblage as a non-Argonian you'll find the Argonian residents outside of maybe the only female one there saying ""maybe this isn't the best place for you"" especially when you're a Dunmer. Why exactly would Ulfric let me mingle and possibly riot in his city when he's fighting a war against  a far larger powerhouse like the Empire? Lastly, as per saying Skyrim is for the Nords? That's a bullshit point, literally every Nord NPC is programmed to say it once they run out of other dialogue packages. One of the few exceptions to that rule is Ulfric and Galmar, they're not programmed to say that, they just reuse their existing dialogue. 

&gt; He ritualisticly rails against elves which is racist as the Thalmor are just one faction of one elven province his hatred and generalization is most certainly racist. If this is a hard concept just imagine any person in the real world and instead of saying ""drive ""PERSON"" out"" say ""drive the "" THAT PERSON'S RACE "" out"" you should notice the second statement is racist. 

Then you lack the ability to listen, because Ulfric says ""Thalmor"" and not ""Altmer"". The Thalmor are a political party and not every Altmer is part of it, some oppose it, some join it, some are apathetic a lot like Germans in the WWII and the SS (yes I know about Godwin's Law). He's saying drive the Thalmor out, not the Altmer, this isn't rocket science. 

&gt; To suggest that the empire is somehow more racist than the stormcloak movement is beyond solid reasoning, not a single city in Cyridil barred Khajiit this is a Skyrim policy that the imperials merely allowed to maintain control much like they allowed Morrowind slavery.

Don't strawman me, I said they were comparable and both flawed in that regard. But since you want to hold the Empire as some paragon of egalitarianism I'm going to give you some examples of how the Empire isn't all sunshine and roses in regards to race. First off, we're going to look at Skyrim exclusively, you ever talk to Tullius and hear something along the lines ""without the Empire Skyrim will revert to barbarism""? If you did and paid attention in English class in High School then you'll know that's more or less a rip off of the [White Man's Burden](https://www.shmoop.com/white-mans-burden/poem-text.html). That in of itself is damning, but keep in mind it applies to every other province under the Empire's rule because it is an EMPIRE. It exists to funnel resources and influence back into the motherland like every other empire. Second, have you noticed the way Legionnaires say the word Jarl when you ask them what the Empire is doing in Skyrim? Its said with a sneer, much like a British noble sneering at the concept of an Indian Raja appearing in court. That's not even touching on all the stuff from Oblivion, you want that too? Too bad, you're getting that too: 

http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Gerich_Senarel

http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Mach-Na

http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Arentus_Falvius

http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Isa_Raman

And that's just a few from Cyrodiil, you might cry ""but they're from the 3rd era!!"" And I'd say why would you expect any change from the population of a province that effectively colonizes its neighbors to exert dominance? Just look at Tullius' attitude and how he drains Haafingar for the war effort, its not all that different from how Churchill exploited India's farmland for grain to feed the British Army in Europe and Mesopotamia to point of causing a famine. 

&gt; Not a single city in Cyridil barred Khajiit this is a Skyrim policy that the imperials merely allowed to maintain control much like they allowed Morrowind slavery. 

That's irrelevant to the point, because the caravans aren't banned because of racism. They're banned because they smuggle illegal drugs in pretty much every part of Skyrim they go to regardless of whose banner that Hold flies. As for Morrowind, they could have stopped the slave trade once they acquired the Numidium but they didn't. Because it wasn't worth the effort required to backtrack on the deal to continue ignoring it. The Empire never gave a damn about the Khajiit and Argonians in its ranks unless there was something to gain. 

&gt; There was even a dark elf in charge of Cheddinhal wheras Skyrim is ran entirely by Nords.

Because Cyrodiil is a lot more diverse with a much different history than Skyrim? This comparison is retarded at best, because Cyrodiil is a melting pot due to its position in the continent. It borders every major province and habitually maintains hegemonic power over at least one of those neighbors. That's like pointing to [Flavius Stilicho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stilicho) and saying the Romans didn't consider themselves above the neighboring tribes and kingdoms. Skyrim is situated in arguably the northernmost point of Tamriel and has had two Nordic Empires before the foundation of the Alessian Dynasty. They're a culture that's very old and very established and the population (exception being Markarth) is majority Nord because of the geographical position of Skyrim and climate. Are you really telling me someone from Morrowind or Hammerfell is going to go to Skyrim when Cyrodiil is easier to get to, more metropolitan, and has a far more hospitable climate? Of course not, you're not that stupid (I hope), you're comparing apples to oranges when you say Cyrodiil has had a Dunmer ruler while Skyrim hasn't. And that's not even touching the bullshit [Katariah had to deal with due to her Dunmer ancestry](http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Katariah).

&gt; The Argonians were part of the empire per treaty

So is Morrowind, I'd recommend you learn what de jure and de facto are. They could have invaded Morrowind the day Titus Mede took the throne at the beginning of the fourth era and the Empire wouldn't have lifted a finger. 

&gt; It is because of this that Morrowind was able to purchase slaves obtained though the Argonian slave trade with no reprisal from Black Marsh because of the empire's interest in maintaining stability.

And yet you're going to sit here and tell me Ulfric is racist when there is no legal organized slavery in Skyrim to allow? Especially since the Nords have never actually really engaged in the slave trade in centuries where it was a staple in Dunmer lands for millenia? 

&gt; Once they left the empire they were able to retaliate with force to solidify the end of their subjugation when the Dunmer were at their most vulnerable Hist or no Hist the motive is clear.

I've said this before and I'll say it again, the Empire wouldn't have lifted a finger to stop the Argonians from invading Morrowind because they couldn't. By de jure the Argonians were subject to Imperial rule but by de facto they had the agency to do whatever they pleased. Following the interregnum pretty much all of Tamriel was able to do whatever it wanted due to the power vacuum. Furthermore, the Legions under Mede would never have been able to put down the Argonians. Tiber Septim himself couldn't do it and simply created a few forts so he could move on. If the great Tiber Septim himself couldn't do it I don't see how the Medes could, because frankly very few even deign to compare to Tiber. And those that do, Alessia, Reman I, Ysgramor, etc. are all legendary figures themselves or extremely good at doing what they do. The Medes have only been around for a century or two and have proven to be a mediocre dynasty at best.

The movies have left me undecided on them on whether or not I like them besides Rogue One.  The sequel trilogy has a lot of issues though, the worst offender to me has been the timing and pacing of them.  Along with those, besides Rey and Kylo, the rest of the new characters haven't made much of an impression on me and I really don't feel invested or care about them.  I also disagree with some of the retreading of the OT and decisions for the OT character's stories not adding up to much accomplished.  Rogue One I really enjoyed, and I felt it would've fit just fine in the old EU since the Death Plans were already split up into pieces there.

The novels, as someone who owns over 110 Star Wars novels from the old EU and has read almost everything released from back then, have been very disappointing.  They're so inconsequential now.  Disney is afraid to let anything big happen outside of the movies so that the larger audience doesn't miss it, that nothing much really happens in them anymore.  We get smaller character driven stories, no more big events like the Thrawn trilogy or a moon killing Chewbacca.  I read the I guess first batch of them up to Bloodlines, and then nothing else has seemed interesting enough for me to even bother with.  I wish we would see the old EU brought back, revive the Sword of the Jedi trilogy, but I know it won't happen.

The comics are about the same as the novels except gotta add bad art in the main Star Wars series as an issue.  I just read all the old EU comics starting from Dawn of the Jedi to Legacy II at the beginning of the year, followed by the new Marvel ones up to Luke going to the planet with the blue rock giant.  Dark Horse did it better, all of it.  They did Vader better in their 4 Vader series and definitely in Purge which is one of my favorites.  The time after Yavin between IV and V was covered very well in Rebellion, Empire, and the just Star Wars titled comics, and Marvel's main series even borrows some from these.  Finally the original Clone Wars comics were amazing.

I do enjoy Rebels and The Clone Wars animated series.  TCW was better and I hope in this last season of Rebels we can see some TCW level stories and seriousness from the show.

The longer Disney Canon goes on the more it pushes me back towards the old EU.

Natural rights are not grounded in Christianity. Christians of the same period died of easily treatable diseases and lived like pigs as well, you are correct. Part of that is because they had kings, popes, slavery, and no respect for individual rights.

Libertarianism is about the future my friend, it is an ideology which will allow us to live together in peace and prosperity. Yes, a ton of progress toward it was achieved in the 18th century, but it's an ongoing project.

We should preserve even more land, but most of America is pretty empty anyway, so there isn't much of a rush to preserve.  And I don't think it's subjective to say we have excellent national parks.  I've travelled Europe and lived in the Czech Republic for years and my experience there was 1) European parks are more like our smaller suburban ""forests,"" every path is well-worn and the chances of seeing large, wild animals are thin - none, 2) Violent crime was just not a thing there.  No street pollution, no neighbors having parties all night, no boom boxes, only saw graffiti a few times, almost a non-existent murder rate - none of the serial killer stuff we have here.  American newspapers are filled with murder and violent domestic and child abuse and rape and attempted murder/armed robbery stories every single day - that stuff just did not happen in the Czech Republic.  I reject the notion that the issue is the system and not crime.

&gt; Vanguard ist keine Genossenschaft, sondern eine Gruppe von Investmentfonds, die alle Anteile an der Kapitalanlagegesellschaft aufgekauft haben, die sie verwaltet.
&gt;
&gt; Dies wäre in Deutschland illegal und wurde auch von der Bafin ausdrücklich verboten:
&gt;
&gt;* Das Prinzip der Trennung zwischen KAG und Fondsvermögen wird so aufgehoben und die Trennung in KAG-Vermögen und Sondervermögen aufgeweicht
&gt;* Da in den Fondsanteilen der Wert der KAG enthalten ist, entstehen dem Anleger Verluste, wenn die KAG pleite geht.
&gt;* Abhängig von dem Ausgang noch nicht geführter Gerichtsverfahren könnte das Fondsvermögen bei einer KAG-Pleite voll für die Verbindlichkeiten der KAG haftbar gemacht werden, was zu einem Totalverlust für die Anleger führen könnte.
&gt;* Wenn Fondsanteilen zurückgegeben werden und das verwaltete Vermögen sinkt, verliert die KAG automatisch Eigenkapital und muss schrumpfen. Der Anteil des Vermögens, der in die KAG investiert sein darf, ist nämlich vertraglich begrenzt. Schafft die KAG es nicht, schnell genug zu schrumpfen, wird sie automatisch insolvent. Besitzt irgend ein einzelner Anteilsinhaber so viele Anteile, dass er mit der Rückgabe aller seiner Anteile die KAG unter die festgelegte Grenze *zwingen* kann, kann er die KAG quasi auf Knopfdruck in die Insolvenz schicken
&gt;  
&gt; Diese Risiken erklären zum Teil die geringeren Gebühren.
&gt;
&gt; Eine weitere Tatsache ist, dass Vanguard Ableger auf anderen Kontinenten besitzt (z.B. Vanguard Europe), die Fonds unter der Vanguard-Marke vertreiben, die im Gegensatz zu den US-Fonds aber selbst keine von Anteile von Vanguard besitzen. Die Gebühren sind bei diesen Nicht-US-Vanguard Fonds marktüblich, was zu zusätzlichen Gewinnen bei Vanguard führt.

Aber wie gesagt, in Europa haben wir dieses Risiko nicht, weil KAG und Fondsvermögen komplett getrennt sind; dafür aber etwas höhere Kosten als in den USA.

AnaSyn, is a strategy to collapse the capitalist production, thrugh direct action and the uniting all workers in a federation of Unions. It's about uniting proletariat, not, separation of it. 

You could argue that if all the workers aren't part of the union it would fragment the workers in different classes, something we saw with the Soviet system. To that, we could argue that the system of administrating the working space should not be an union, but a co-op, where all othe workers are oweners of the means of productions, and the union has a role of support, education and agitation (see the examples of cooperatibes in Northen Kurdistan).

You can also see this example in Europe, where for you have Coperativa Integran de Catalunya, which has the role of a union in the theorical example I give before. They have no power in the co-ops, and their members' role and responsability is supporting the creation of alternative workspaces. In many cases, these Co-ops or organizations, were born from organizing unions in work spaces, that at some point decided to constitute a co-op with thes support of CIC.

Despite the aforementioned, he was still vastly very unpopular and unknown quantity. To the majority of trance community, I'd say 2016 was a semi-breakout year as he started shying away from Monster onto the bigger labels.  Notable releases including ""Until We Collide on Subculture"", ""Nevada on FSOE, which made the 450 compilation"", ""Poseidon on Outburst"", ""Gold Rush on Mental Asylum"" to name a few really brought him in the spotlight. Huge part of this recognition perhaps to him completely evolving his sound from the euphoric and melodic to a much darker and emotive spectrum suited perfectly for clubs and festivals. Laying the platform for the gigantic rise in 2017 with more subsequent releases on additional labels like debuting on Kearnage and Pure Trance. As well as the widespread recognition and praise from JOC hailing him ""the most talented artist he ever worked with"". And to add to all that, making debut tours to Aus, NA for Dreamstate and Toronto, when he wasn't even touring outside Europe before (bear in mind German trance scene is incredibly slow too).

Depends what you think the goal behind it is.  The corporate part which was left out of that link basically will give an incentive for companies to bring their money stashed overseas back here.  The flood out of europe/asia will not be good for them.  

Big companies don't pay any corporate tax as it is, but this will help the small business sector, which is where most job growth is anyway.

Then the personal restructuring is rip some of the loopholes out for those states that have high housing costs and high tax costs.  Currently, deductions subsidize high real estate values, because bankers take into account the tax deduction when valuing a property.   Take that away, and the idea is prices will reflect market value better.

Residents in states with high taxes might reconsider living there with these big deductions taken away.  The goal is to get those to states to lower taxes, reduce government expenditures, and stimulate the economy.  That's the theory anyway.

WikiTextBot,,,"**Banlieue**

In France, a banlieue (French: [bɑ̃ljø]) is a suburb of a large city. Banlieues are divided into autonomous administrative entities and do not constitute part of the city proper. For instance, 80% of the inhabitants of the Paris area live outside the city of Paris. Like the city centre, suburbs may be rich, middle-class or poor—Versailles, Le Vésinet, Maisons-Laffitte and Neuilly-sur-Seine are affluent banlieues of Paris, while Clichy-sous-Bois, Bondy and Corbeil-Essonnes are less so.

**Immigration to France**

France received immigrants in successive waves during the 19th and 20th centuries. They were sometimes rapidly assimilated into French culture when European successive post-war governments wanted to promote immigration and so promoted the notion of France as an inclusive nation with universal values stemming from the French Enlightenment.

In 2008, the French national institute of statistics INSEE, which has a more restrictive definition of immigration than Eurostat, estimated that 5.3 million foreign-born immigrants and 6.5 million direct descendants of immigrants (born in France with at least one immigrant parent) lived in France representing a total of 11.8 million and 19% of the total population in metropolitan France (62.1 million in 2008). Among them, about 5.5 million are of European origin, 4 million of Maghrebi (either Arab-Berber) origin, 1 million of Sub-saharan African origin and 400,000 of Turkish origin.

&gt; Spain&amp;#039;s Economy Minister Luis de Guindos has put the cost of the Catalan independence crisis at around &amp;euro;1bn. He told Spanish radio that it was due to the slowdown in the Catalan economy after the unauthorised independence referendum on 1 October.

&gt; The separatists are best placed to form a new administration, with separatist groups winning 70 of 135 seats in parliament.

&gt; Mr de Guindos urged the separatists to abandon the &amp;quot;Unilateral way&amp;quot; and focus on the &amp;quot;Basic necessities&amp;quot; of Catalan society.

The country sides are more isolated so you're more likely to hear it there I think.

So you're going to lose a bit of performance by going with a Ryzen 1600 instead of something like an i5 8600k on a 1080p 144hz panel. But by going with the cheaper Ryzen chip i was able to fit in a 1070ti (when overclocked it performs similar to a 1080), RGB water cooler and NZXT's Hue+ (RGB controller + Strips). All that in the p400s with a temperd glass side panel is going to look pretty badass imo.

Edit: I don't think the 1070ti Titanium comes with a backplate, so you might want to get a nice custom one made for it.

MNGrrl,,,"&gt;  if they don’t share more user data *to fight terrorism*


It works just as well for all the reasons our civil liberties should be shit on: bullying, hate speech, child abuse, *-ism, and more. Tech companies are right to ignore these demands. Unfortunately, tech companies are flat wrong in how they're using that data now. Monetization and marketing aren't the moral high ground. Turning customers into products isn't something to be lauded. 


The truth is, the reason these things don't gain traction is because the EU and most of its member states throughout Europe aren't anymore interested in these other problems than getting their own slice of the cake. They want control over Facebook and Google because they can make money off of it. They know they can't stop or even make a dent in the problem because there are terabytes of text-based conversation happening every day. We'd have to hire half the population to police the other half. And if that sounds familiar, it should: It's what East Germany was doing right up until the Berlin Wall was toppled. That's the future of the internet: A wall between the economically developed first world, and a despotic third world.


And it will be justified by saying it's for ""terrorism"" or whatever. This demand is about as emotionally mature as Trump claiming he's going to build a concrete wall along the US/Mexican border. It's pursuing a social policy that's counter to its own goal: It won't stop immigration. If anything the false sense of security will make it easier in the long run. The maintenance costs, which will take away funding from boots on the ground, and an over-reliance on cameras, will all but destroy border integrity.

Eu não achei ruim, mas desde que a série passou a ser produzida pelo Netflix (3a temporada), ela perdeu um pouco do rumo e a visão original.

Meu problema com a 3a temporada foi que boa parte dos episódios focaram mais em ação e aventura do que as temporadas passadas.

Já a última temporada, além de ser a mais “positiva” de todas (o que necessariamente não é algo ruim), focou demais no aspecto sci-fi ao invés do social, e reusou o mesmo artifício (mentes humans rodando em máquinas) em literalmente metade dos episódios.

Might be NSFW

Before HRT i had no need/wanting to have sex whit anyone, due to sex was gross for me. Other than that my sexuality was lets say: Weird...

Like guys were repulsive/&amp; gross and only thing i liked about guys was their dicks(and it was only set of genitalia i had neutral/good feelings towards).

When it came to women i finded them asthetically really pleasing but their genitalia grossed me out.

Perfect partner/my better half would had been either a asexual cis woman or nonop trans woman(and i wouldn't mind her being asexual).

So my sexuality(attractions) was:

*  Physical(no genitalia) attraction towards female bodied people, maybe androgynous guys
* Mental:Basically anyone, male or female
* Genitalia: I only felt attraction towards penises. Would had been okay whit a person who had vagina but was asexual. I were really asexual, not wanting to have sex whit anyone


Now being on hormones(and let me tell you hormones are weird, atleast for me in mental effects sense...):

Suddenly guys stopped being repulsive&amp;gross(like physically i find guys neutral now, okay but usually still not as asthetically pleasing as women(in general, no matter their body type).... Weird since this change happened just in first and second week of HRT....

Also HRT made my phatom breasts dissapear(replaced whit actual breasts) and gave me phantom vagina(i feel like there is another set of genitalia behind my male genitalia????)

When it comes to women i have mostly same feelings, but i dont tend to see women as ""hot?"" anymore(aside maybe like certain types, eg latinos(not objectifing them due to their ethnics) for some reason i am attracted(most) to both latino guys and girls, mostly girls, probably due to me being from Northern Europe where all guys and girls are same white fairly blondes?)(despite being asexual)???
Like now a hot/cute guy beats a normal(where i am from most women look like shorter super models..., so normal is subjective) woman for me now...

Then there is whole new aspect: Sexual attraction... I never really realized it excisted or was normal(?), but now(since being on hrt for few weeks) a cute guy really turns me sexually on... Its weird as (insert curse word).... And now i have a weird need to have a vaginal(PIV) sex whit a guy(or PIV whit a cute trans guy), despite me not having these sort of genitals and probably never being able to have sex whit guys if i ever got vagina upgrade, due to me being really ridicously small(1 inch flacid, 2 inches when hard?) in that department....


So recap, now after being on HRT(and having come off of it for few days due to limited(6 day supply for 8 days, it used to be like 9 day supply for 19 days...) supply the sexual changes have not dissapeared???? WTH??? I tought when my body started running mostly on T again and no E(1mg of e for like 3 days, i used to have 2-3mg E per day...) it would like reverse the mental changes but nope!?

Actual recap:

* Physical(no genitalia): Into both women and men now, a normal woman beats uglier guy, but a cute guy beats a normal woman... WTH?
* Mental: Same like it used to be, basically anyone male or female
* Genitalia: I still exclusevly like the D, still am okayish whit preop(but on T and bottom growth) transguy genitalia. Still not attracted one bit to normal vaginas(not saying that trans guys have vaginas)...

* Sexual attraction/sexual pull(as in rubber band): Brand new, and for guys. I for some weird reason feel now sexually pulled towards guys.... A really weird change.... Before HRT i never had anything like that....


Weird thing is that all the sexual changes seem to be from HRT, since i had fully accepted myself(even sexually, i had some exceptions towards guys which were only mental, like for them being really helpful towards me???) for 2 whole years before i got on HRT... And only thing that seems to trigger these sexual changes was HRT... Literally nothing else/new going on my live 2 months ago....

* In **Brotherhood** space, weddings are Big, raucous affairs with dancing, food and more then a little lewd humor. Everyone you know is likely to show up and just as likely to bring people you've never met. The separation between Ceremonial and reception is all but nonexistent where the entirety of the formal part taking place about an hour in where very loose vows are exchanged followed but a blessing by the officiant authority as well as a blessing from a member of family and a close friend for each person getting married. If one of the poeple involved in planing is particularly organized, there might be two parties, One public affair and a second ""Crew"" party slightly off to the side. Given the sheer size of gathering expected and the cost of feeding basicly three times as many people as you invite, Multi weddings are fairly common. In fact before the Official part is finished the officiant might call out ""Before we depart back to the festivities, Be there any more Lovers who wish to pair under these fair stars?"" when any couple (Or more) might suddenly choose to get married then and there.

The Party part is basically your standard keger. No formal dress is expect for anyone, but women often do make a point to look nice and the bride will often spend days if not weeks into preparing to look her finest. Likewise, the groom will often put some effort into matching his lady. *this is of course talking about the original couple, moochers will wear what they wear*. The only truly traditional part of the thing is that at some point, someone WILL put on ""Tubthumping by Chumbawamba"" and when it does, the whole party will stop to sing along.

Where it will take place depends on your place in society. If your a land lover, you will most likely have it at your family home. If your a spacer, then it will likely be on the ship you serve most likely the mess hall. If you're a captain, I will also be on ship but the party will be vastly expanded to basically the whole ship. And if your an admiral, the whole fleet is expected to join up in one heck of a party with the "".

* In the **GTE (Grand Terrian Empire)** most wedding based off the Western European Wedding with the white dress and suits. It's a fairly formal affair with groomsmen and brides maids. There is a distinctly separated wedding ceremony followed by a reception that often takes place at a separated location.

Other than that, a most weddings will very widely as cultures mix and fashions go in and out of style.

* **Stingyons** doing really have weddings so much as breeding contracts. They bred through eggs after all and so the Male and Female might never directly meet. Inviting anyone but those absolutely necessary to the final meeting would be met with looks of confusion over the fuss. If the ""groom"" is satisfied with everything agreed upon, He might not even show up, letting it fall to his parents and the lawyers. After everything has been finalized there might be a party but nothing more then what a business man might throw for having made a big sale to a client.

When it's time for him to fulfill his part of the breeding process, he might met with the female and they will ""dust"" his genetic material onto the egg together or he might send his genetic material to her or even to a third party nursery for them to do everything. once the child hatches and makes it's infantile pouch, it will be sent to him for him to carry for about a year until it's the equivalent of a human toddler.

Many breeding pairs will chose to go through this process together but a number see no point or choice but to do it in this deeply impersonal fashion.

- The **Exor* do not have weddings. All of those interested in continuing their genetic line make a donation to a public Reproduction center where The material is examined and matched with opposite material. When a child has been successfully produced the parents are contacted.

w3woody,northcarolina text,"Glendale, CA -&gt; Raleigh, NC","In fact, like all redevelopment districts everywhere (even in the US), French ZUS areas have a large number of impoverished individuals--and sadly (even as your video points out) unemployment rates amongst muslim immigrants is in the 40% range, while unemployment for the rest tends to be in the 5%-6% range. (At the 9:15 mark in your video.)

So it's not hard to have a poor area, and see poor immigrants migrating to those poor areas. (You see the same thing happen in the United States.) And once those poor immigrants locate to an area, they bring their culture--which in Europe, means Muslims, including some folks who think a Caliphate may be better than their current circumstances, and a few folks who think Sharia Law would be an improvement. (Again, you see this in the United States; remember President Obama's ""clinging to their guns and bibles"" comment?)

But it's a matter of cause and effect. Thinking they are ZUSes because they're full of Muslim immigrants is ass-backwards; those zones were impoverished and problematic long before the civil war in Syria fueled the current wave of immigrants. 

The real problem is Europe's relative failure to help immigrants integrate into their societies (because European Nations tend to be a single people with a single set of beliefs occupying a territory and having a government). This have made the situation worse. 

(This is in contrast to the United States, where we handle immigrant integration far better--because we were not founded as a single people and a single culture, but as a multi-cultural society pretty much from the start. And because we expect full self-sufficiency by immigrants pretty much from day one, including obtaining a job and paying for one's own housing. We provide less public aid to immigrants in the United States, but in contrast we have no problems with immigrant communities--and even see them as tourist spots, such as the various Little Chinas around the country.)

----

In short: poverty increases crime. Muslims immigrating to Europe tend to be poor. To conclude Muslims cause crime is a logical fallacy; at best it's a [post-hoc fallacy](http://onegoodmove.org/fallacy/posthoc.htm). But it is an understandable error--and both ends of the political spectrum in the United States engage in post-hoc fallacies all the fucking time.

Please, do not take my understanding as a defense. My comment about confirmation bias was to point out that the fact that a large American audience who think there are Muslims wanting to push Sharia law in no-go zones in Europe is not some sort of conspiracy theory to shove an agenda, as your remarks imply.

It's just mass stupidity.

And mass stupidity not dissimilar to what we see on Reddit All. The. Fucking. Time.

Roland_Traveler,,,"Mine was a recent Savoy game. After forming Italy, the midgame slowed down as a Bohemian-French-Ottoman axis dominated Europe. It even beat up me and Austria once, but it turned around after I got rich off of trade and went fishing for allies. After fortifying the Alps and swapping out my infantry for mercs (didn't have CoC at this point) and allying England and Ireland (who were allies, surprisingly, despite Ireland owning Scotland), the tables stabilized. I also ate Naples, who broke away from Spain, around this time for extra luck. Then I got England in a PU out of nowhere in the 1660s. And France went Revolutionary and lost most of its big allies (I had already won a couple of rounds against them, though), letting me and my Norman march take twice as much territory. Then I got a Spanish PU in the 1720s. By this time the New World was my subject's subjects, French cannon fodder, a rogue California, and some allied Portuguese colonies, so I dominated the New World. I got so strong I could beat up Rev France with its starting borders minus Paris, Emperor Blobhemia, and the Ottomans at once by my self (plus PUs, but my troops got so good that they disintegrated most armies that weren't twice their size. Italian ideas + very army idea except Aristocratic + Protestant buffs is OP). Then I bought CoC, Rights of Man, and Cossacks and my armies, even those that were half merc, became even more deadly. By this point the only thing I had to worry about was my Irish ally fucking up in Asia and refusing to ask for help. I had to declare two wars to fix their mistakes. But not for long, I got a PU over them too and retook all their land. By the end of the game I had eaten France and gave its northern parts to Normandy and Brittany to Britain, controlled the entirety of the British Isles through PUs, had Iberia split between my PU and a docile ally, resurgent, and allied, Austria and Brandenburg dominating the HRE, and had reclaimed the Straights for Christendom. I had even more luck, because Malta left Spain at one point, allowing me to immediately scoop them up. Then, while I had them in a PU, they lost Sardinia and Sicily, which I immediately ate before they could get allies. The only three unlucky things in this run were having to save-scum to get Milan in a PU (eventually gave up and simply beat the shit out of them and turned them back into a monarchy when the went republic, then got them), the dominating block in the mid game, and Austria breaking our alliance to fight a succession war over Spain(?) because we were both Hapsburgs. I simply had to pay them off and things went back to normal.  All in all, it was a really lucky endgame that ended with Italy solidly in the first place amongst the Great Powers.",True,0,1514849027,,False,0,ds20dij,False,t3_7ndjhc,t3_7ndjhc,/r/eu4/comments/7ndjhc/best_streak_of_luck_you_ever_had_in_a_game/ds20dij/,1517473183,1,False,eu4,t5_2uqat,public,

Youth competitions have **always** been meaningless. Hell, *international* youth competitions are meaningless. People don't care about the *Olympic* tournament despite it being, you know, the Olympics.

The UEFA U21s and U19s, and the U20 World Cup, are all played in the off-season for this reason - because no club in Europe would ever release a first-team player, and neither UEFA nor FIFA would ever require them to.

&gt;  Playing against the best opposition in the continent is going to do more for their development than 4 a league games.

A handful of games against kids from weak footballing nations is going to do absolutely nothing for their development either.

It's belittling and irritating, it makes us fucking hate you.

Fun Fact: the only time that NATO's stipulation has been called, you know the one that says 'if any one of the member nations is attacked we'll all go to their defence' was when those terrorists you created threw a couple planes at you. Big old strong America needed little baby Western Europe's help then to invade a country in order to find a guy who was actually next door in a country you think you control.

Then all your other propaganda leaks over here - 'oh land of the free, home of the brave' accompanied by your films and TV which take the piss out of the rest of us (other than the nationalism, your film industry makes some good stuff, not denying that). Then all our fucking kids start adopting your American crap with Proms and fucking Thanksgiving now for some fucking reason.

I'm not denying that any other country of the world hasn't done some dodgy shit in their past. Western European countries have done some really fucked up things. But, you've existed as a country, as a union for 240 years. You're a baby compared to the rest of the world... yet you've have done more in those 240 years than most of these ancient countries have EVER done. Nearly every single one of your 45 Presidents have done some fucked up shit in office. You were the country that stopped slavery after everyone else.

You do some really evil shit to win and I don't think that's an overstatement. And it's not like it's just your government. You're the ultimate liberal democracy, I thought that means the government is supported by the people and can ONLY exist under their support. You support this shit that goes on. Every fucking American who doesn't say shit about it and just chants 'USA! USA! USA!' when we call you out is responsible.

Thephalanx23,,,"&gt;Sorry, Unlike Turks who have collective little dick syndrome and a deep rooted sense of inferiority, Greeks in large part do not derive their self worth from their countries, or what their Ancestors did or didn't do. Irrelevant rants of a pathetic sad Turk.

LOL

Do you even believe what you're saying? Your inferiority  complex towards Turks became a large part of your culture. You're on the same level as Armenians.

&gt;Also LOL talking as if your Empire was great, the Ottomans were the shittest Empire possibly in Existence. The Byzantine Empire and Alexanders Empires were far greater and had a much greater, lasting cultural impact.

Doesn't change the fact that Byzantine Empire was pathetic and we King Kong smashed your empire. Besides Byzantine empire was not ""great"" in any way. Literally everyone at some point defeated your meme empire. Arabs, Bulgarians, Venetians, Turks etc. No one liked it.

&gt;And you were kicked out of Epirus, Attica, the Peloponnese, the Aegean, Crete, and Macedonia by low IQ stupid Greeks ..thanks for the Islands KOMSHU

Uh Uh. Egyptians and Turks crushed your meme uprising. When they were about to put an end to your LARPing, The French/British and Russians showed up and saved you. You owe your independence to them. Which makes your country even more pathetic.

&gt;Lol didn't realize we had two

Empire of Trebziond and Byzantine Empire. I know they're too pathetic to be called Empire but you called them empire. 

&gt;unless you are on some ""we wuz khans"" Bullshit, and referring to some steepe Asian you have no relation too, cause you're an islamfied Greek.

Are you trying to discuss genetics with me? Because i'm pretty good at wrecking people in genetic arguments. And no. We're not Islamized Greeks. Rather, we're descendants of the Turkmens who wrecked your pathetic meme empire and the Anatolians who were hellenized by your inferior kind. Anatolians were building empires when you were living in mud huts by the way.

Proofs

https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-15-963

&gt;The weights for the migration events predicted to originate from the East Asian branch into current-day Turkey was 0.217

&gt;We show that the genetic variation of the contemporary Turkish population clusters with South European populations, as expected, but also shows signatures of relatively recent contribution from ancestral East Asian populations.

and here a study (kinda outdated though) which says
http://etd.lib.metu.edu.tr/upload/12607764/index.pdf

&gt;Moreover, results pointed out that language in Anatolia might not have been replaced by the elites, but by a large group of people. Therefore, it can be concluded that the observations do not support the elite dominance model of Renfrew (1987 ; 1991).

If you want to discuss genetics with me, feel free to do so. Because this is my hobby.

Oh and get that ""islamized greek"" out of your mind. Because ethnically we're closer to Northern Caucasians, Persians and Azerbaijanis than to your kind. Besides. What's Greek ethnicity? A lot of Greeks are hellenized Pontians, Armenians, Slavs, Albanians, Levantines etc etc. You're American tier. As far as i remember to be considered Greek you had to be ""Orthodox"" according to 1827 Greek law.

hellotheremiss,,social realism,"In a span of a month, I finished the Europe series (Europe in Autumn, Europe at Midnight, Europe in Winter) by Dave Hutchinson. It's an alt-history, near-future sci-fi about a Europe that has fragmented into various small nation-states. There isn't much technology in it. It's more about conspiracies and clandestine organizations. It's very well-written. The first book is my favorite among the three. The second one is okay, and the third wraps everything together. Its greatest strength in my opinion is the main character, Rudi. He's immensely likeable. 

Some issues I had with the series: the use of fake identities and names makes you lose touch of who is really who, who is working for what organization. There's also the numerous characters that just are shoved at you 'in the thick of things'. It's fine but you get this sense of disorientation for a while, since it takes a moment for things to click, or the narrative to connect somewhere in the main story. For a sci-fi, there isn't that much technology in it that can be deemed cool. The main technologies aren't really delved into that much, so you just have to take a lot of it in faith, that is, it's more fantastic than speculative-scientific.

* JC and TM to remain in place, so long as TM survives the upcoming cabinet reshuffle (likely) and JC remains in good health (very likely)

* Slow but steady Brexit progress, end up more or less maintaining the current status quo, but with little say on any rules, a huge bill and implementation of checks that existed before or were negotiated by David Cameron before the ref. No second Brexit ref.

* Polls remain broadly the same. Tory's drop a few points over the year, but remain within 5-8 percentage points of Labour. LD stay pretty dead, maybe gaining a couple (2-3) points. UKIP gain a few (~5) points as Brexit continues to unravel.

* Labour generally win local elections and by-elections by a greater-than-expected margin.

* Tony Blair's efforts over the past year or two start to materialise. Possible that a new centrist party emerges, with TB influencing and supporting out in the shadows, but being careful that the new party isn't associated with him.

* Public services go past breaking point. The public gets increasingly frustrated. Some large-scale protests occur, but little change in both polling and policies.

* Macron and Merkel work together without the UK to strengthen the EU, bringing it closer with even more shared laws and governance.

* Russian tensions increase, escalating to near-cold-war levels. Some sanctions occur, but little has effect.

* Trump either kicks the bucket or is impeached towards the end of the year. Beyond repealing a few bills like Obamacare and annoying Kim, achieves practically nothing. Republicans continue in power until 2020.

* Prince Phillip's health declines. Dies early to mid 2019. The Queen soldiers on.

&amp;nbsp;

As a member of the 29th Infantry Division, I would like to invite you to consider our Charlie Company.

&amp;nbsp;
     
The 29th ID, a tactical realism unit, was established in 2005 by Captain Timothy C. Wilson. In this unit we use a modified American World War Two rank structure, but in-game we operate in a modern way with modern-day tactics. We strive to achieve our victory by using tactics as real and modern as the game currently allows. In the 29th Infantry Division, we are looking for dedicated, mature soldiers willing to put time and effort in advancing their skills with weapons, teamwork, and tactics. Not only for themselves, but also for the unit. We train and fight in both TvT and COOP scenarios with focus on squad and platoon tactics and communications, while at the same time **offering both NA and EU-friendly times.**

mars_rovinator,,,"I shouldn't have to spell this out for you, but I will, because you seem to be fully indoctrinated to believe that you should take everything someone says to the most literal conclusion possible.

This is silly. It's a sign of poor critical thinking skill. Instead, think about what I might mean.

Some people aspire to realistic, achievable goals - like learning how to weld, or becoming a mechanic, or developing computer software.

Many millennials, however - and yes, this is **very** specific to the millennial generation, myself included (I was born in '84) - aspire to unrealistic and impossible goals, like becoming instantly famous or studying medieval German literature and believing a career can be found in such a ludicrously specialized field. They think that life is just like what they see on television, because the explosion in online streaming has caused people to really detach from reality as much as they possibly can.

When you have unrealistic expectations of adult life, you generally also have unrealistic goals for yourself. A goal of ""I'm going to be a millionaire by the time I'm 30"" is unrealistic for most people. It takes well above average intelligence to achieve such a goal, so the statistical majority of the population simply can't achieve such a goal. A goal of ""I'm going to travel Europe for a year after college"" is equally unrealistic for the vast majority of the population. Such a goal requires a **lot** of money, unless you plan on illegally working while abroad.

Even worse, because millennials have been taught that you are objectively stupid and intellectually inferior if you don't go to college, many of them have gotten degrees when their skills would simply be much better suited to trade or vocational work.

My own immediate age demographic - those of us born in the mid to late 80s - was the start of this forced social change. Public schools on the west coast were already teaching the idea that you're objectively inferior if you don't go to college.

That part I *was* insulated from, due to my parents' decision to not send me to public school. I did, however, attend public university.

In high school, I was certainly surrounded with the belief that you should go to college if you want to do anything with your life - that was more due to most of my classmates coming from wealthy, upper-middle-class families. I wasn't surrounded with that kind of ideology at home. I spent my senior year living in the hood, surrounded by mostly working-class, blue-collar families.

Fact is, not everyone should go to college. There are **lots** of people in America who have no real use for higher education, and are much better suited to blue collar work. Instead, because of the doctrine of self, which includes the ""follow your dreams"" mantra, kids who are suited for middle class skilled labor are going to college, majoring in fuck all because they have no higher ed aspirations to begin with, and end up deep in debt with a useless degree and a **completely unrealistic worldview**.

Reality hits hard and fast, and now millions of millennials are still living with their parents into their late 20s and early 30s, completely incapable of fending for themselves.

It's great to follow your dreams, but it's selfish, careless, and dangerous to follow your dreams before you've established self-sufficiency. That takes hard fuckin' work, and if you don't want to put in that effort, then no, you don't deserve to follow your dreams. You deserve to wallow in the mediocrity you've created for yourself, because I sure as hell don't want to finance your lazy ass's fantastical dreams about how life *should* be.

I'm living my dream. I work at the one place I've wanted to work since I was in the single digits, I have a huge property and a beautiful house, I have lots of cash in the bank, I'm married to a wonderful person who can read my mind, and my life is really, really awesome.

You know what, though? It took nearly nine years of blood, sweat, tears, lots of sleepless nights, and some pretty horrible things happening to me before I got to this point.

Millennials believe they're entitled to have right out of college what I have right now. THAT'S why following your dreams is such a dangerous ideology.",True,0,1514859437,,1514860853,0,ds28pj3,False,t3_7nei9i,t1_ds25n5z,/r/CringeAnarchy/comments/7nei9i/this_is_child_abuse/ds28pj3/,1517477309,6,False,CringeAnarchy,t5_35j1r,public,

scrooched_moose,,,"The more I think about this movie, the more I'm convinced Disney just couldn't figure out how to handle rebooting the Star Wars universe and we were left with this weird, inconsistent mess. 

Looking at Episodes 7&amp;8 as a Battlestar Galactica 78/04 style reboot they are pretty good. They derive inspiration from the original trilogy, and share names, concepts, and style but are their own thing. In this fictional rebooted universe, I don't really care we don't know what happened to the New Republic (or whatever it got called after Legends canon was nuked), why Rey is so powerful (because The Force works a little different now), where Snoke came from, or a hundred other little issues. 

What we got instead is this ""soft reboot"", where it's supposedly a direct continuation but they broke...everything. Hyperspace as a weapon, Rey mastering The Force without a bit of training, and Force Ghosts physically impacting the real world retroactively ruin the rest of the canon. It would be like learning in the next Bourne movie that can fly like Superman. No matter how good that story may be, the first thought is ""well, why didn't he use that to escape all of the other situations?"". 

I'm sure there will be EU corrections to patch up this broken continuity eventually but it'll never be good or satisfying. Granted this has always an issue with Star Wars (parsecs?) but I'm much more willing to forgive it in a low budget scifi film written by one man than a multi billion dollar franchise with a [dedicated team](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Lucasfilm_Story_Group) who's sole job is to ensure consistency. 

It seems to be the way to approach this new universe is the OT and PT still happened in a broad sense - key events still occurred and the Jedi are a group of great warriors, but any specific details we learned should be forgotten.

thoth2,,,"&gt; As was always inevitable. That doesn't change the fact that institutions and norms put in place by us are not enormously-successful in crafting the world in a way amenable to us, or that the Chinese haven't learned this lesson (one that seems to have escaped you).

But there will always be certain global norms. Prior to the US-led international order, the global norms were Spheres of Influence of different global powers. Prior to that, it was the Westphalian system and colonialism. Every era has its own norms. We are coming to the point where there will be multipolarity of norms: American-led Bretton Woods or Chinese-led institutions like AIIB and OBOR. My point is that the Chinese won't implement these by force or through coercion as there is no precedence for that on their end. Furthermore, choice is fundamentally a good thing. Countries having different development options is a good thing.

&gt; There is no Chinese model, per se; they will not want to make everyone else mercantilist. There is merely the deconstruction of western norms and other irritations to the ruling party's hold on power, which is where the danger lies.

Define deconstruction. Because so far Chinese trade deals do not involve preconditions such as democracy or any of that crap. It's been strictly business. China hasn't tried to stifle these institutions outside of its own borders. They create their own institutions, but they don't force any others to abandon their own and join Chinese institutions. Yes, Chinese dealings in Africa have been extractive and resource-driven but they don't try to destroy the norms and institutions of African countries.

&gt; There is only one side deriving benefits at little cost.

If that were true, then Europe would be looking to stay with America. But the only country that wants to do that is the UK. Continental Europe realizes that it needs to chart its own independent way if it wants to be relevant on the world stage. I think Europeans will eventually reach a point where they set up their own lasting European institutions away from the US as well as China. This can only be beneficial for both sides: America can do its own thing while Europe can simply chart a route for itself.

I don't see what the issue is exactly. You say Europe doesn't contribute anything to the US and that the US would be better off without them. Yet when they look towards Russia and China, you have an issue with it.

Ewannnn,,,"X-Post from UKPol

**Article text:**

In 2018 the real Brexit negotiations begin. The phase one political agreement between the UK and EU — on financial obligations, rights of expatriate people and Ireland — was a preamble. Concluding a formal treaty governing the UK’s withdrawal in March 2019 is the central task. This should establish the agreements of phase one, and many other separation-related issues, in detailed legal texts between the UK and the European Commission, which must be approved by a large majority of member states, and the British and European parliaments, before the exit date.

This will require intensive negotiation between the UK and the EU. It will also involve other governments since the withdrawal treaty will need to address Britain’s future position in agreements between the EU and other countries. We cannot assume that these will roll forward on current terms, and changes could trigger a wider ratification process in parliaments across Europe and beyond.

If the spectre of a cliff-edge Brexit is to be avoided, the withdrawal treaty should be accompanied next year by a political framework setting parameters for the UK’s future relationship with the EU. This represents a dramatic scaling back of the earlier, unrealistic British ambition to negotiate these future terms in full before March 2019 — a highly significant, if little publicised, outcome of December’s Brussels summit.

There will be two main strands in negotiations about the future: the economic relationship and the wider political relationship, including defence, security and foreign affairs. To reach the framework stage, the British government will soon have to make hard choices about the sort of Brexit it wants, notably on links to the single market and customs union, and acknowledge the limits of what is possible. The EU will negotiate, but will not change its own rules to meet British demands. At home, both the withdrawal treaty and the framework agreement will face intense parliamentary scrutiny through the year and in the final “meaningful” vote.

Because of the scale and complexity of what lies ahead, 2018 will kick off with talks on the terms of a transition period, intended to provide as much political and economic stability as possible after the UK legally leaves the EU in March 2019. The European Commission will argue that transition should end in December 2020 to match its budget cycle. The British government will probably argue for a period of two years, while trying privately to persuade its pro-Brexit faction to keep this open ended. As the deadline approaches, both sides will discover more time is required.

The transition, originally billed as a period for bedding in already agreed arrangements between the UK and the EU, has now morphed into the period in which the detail of those arrangements will be negotiated. Unless they can be agreed and implemented in parallel, this means yet a further implementation period will be needed. On even the most optimistic assumption, the process of scoping, negotiation, ratification and implementation of the new relationship will take a minimum of five years from 2018.

Another purpose of transition is to assure businesses that their operating environment will not be dramatically disrupted. But it is now clear that the longer-term trade and regulatory environment will not be defined for some years, and the commission argues that, even if a political agreement on transition is reached early in 2018, there will be no legal certainty until the UK’s withdrawal treaty is formally ratified.

It is now clear that the longer-term trade and regulatory environment will not be defined for some years

We should expect more turbulence over the year ahead. There will be political strains within the British government. Germany needs a new coalition. The agenda is vast.

We do not yet know what sort of deals on withdrawal and future partnership British ministers will bring to parliament towards the end of the year. As things stand, the best we can hope for is a reasonably ordered formal exit in March 2019, followed by a continuing negotiation as an outside country on the details of our future relationship lasting several years during which we will still be bound by EU rules but have no say in future EU decisions.

By late 2018, we should have a clearer picture of options for the future. We cannot predict how this knowledge will influence public opinion, especially if the British economy shows further signs of stress. If the mood shifts, it will be late, but not yet too late, to change our mind on the whole Brexit project. Meanwhile, this prolonged uncertainty argues for keeping open the option, however difficult, for both the UK and the EU, of trying to delay our formal departure by extending or suspending the Article 50 process beyond March 2019. Once we had left in haste, any repentance would certainly be at leisure.

bhosk,,,"The alliance is building up its presence on its eastern front, but the practical problems are formidable

 When the last US Abrams battle tanks left Germany in 2013, it marked the end of a 69-year presence, and told of a western military alliance untroubled by potential problems on Europe’s borders. Just a few years later American armour is again fanning out across the continent’s east with a mission not just to show strength to an emboldened Russia, but to test whether the mundane matter of logistics might hobble Nato’s response to any provocative action.

The scores of US fighting vehicles that in September rolled on to the docks in Gdansk in Poland were the latest to join an urgent effort to test the obstacles to rapid Nato deployment in Europe.

Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea tops a list of security worries that have brought the “peace dividend” era after the fall of the Berlin Wall to an abrupt end. General Robert Neller, the US marine corps commandant, warned US troops stationed in Norway late last month that he felt “there’s a war coming”. His spokesperson later said the general did not believe a battle imminent, but was stressing the need “to be ready for the full spectrum of conflict”.

Just a week earlier, a senior Russian official had accused Nato of forcing Moscow against its will into “military competition in the centre of Europe”.

“After the wall came down . . . it didn’t even occur to anybody that we would have to be moving across eastern Europe in any kind of military formation,” says General Ben Hodges, until recently commander of the US Army Europe. “We all thought Russia was going to be our partner. Everybody started downsizing their military as fast as they could.”

Now, a senior Nato official says the alliance is “looking at all those things we forgot how to do”. He admits the pact — or at least some of its members — could have been quicker to heed warnings from events such as a wide-ranging cyber attack in Estonia in 2007 and the brief Russia-Georgia war in 2008. “All of the indicators were there,” he says. “We took our eye off the ball.”

Others in Nato dispute that it has been too slow to adjust to big changes in the international security environment. But officials in both the alliance’s sprawling Brussels headquarters and the capitals of its 29 member states agree that there is an urgent need to sharpen operations in Europe. Both Nato and the EU have launched multi-pronged initiatives to address logistics concerns from easing transport bottlenecks to reforming time-consuming border customs procedures. 

The military overhaul in Europe is providing a new test of Nato’s capacity for reinvention, nearly 70 years after it was founded. The alliance is now trying to demonstrate its ability to protect a post-cold war frontier that stretches from the Arctic Circle to northern Syria. 

The challenges facing Nato range from the capabilities of cash-strapped European militaries, to the commitment of President Donald Trump’s US administration and the intentions of President Vladimir Putin’s Russia. Nato also faces questions about whether its scaled-up territorial security is proportionate — or risks provoking the very kind of conflict it is supposed to prevent. 

“Nato certainly doesn’t want a new cold war, [but] the world has changed and therefore Nato has to change,” says Jens Stoltenberg, the pact’s secretary-general, who took over less than a year after the Crimea conflict began. “For the first time in our history, we need to do crisis management beyond our borders and at the same time step up . . . our efforts for collective defence in Europe.”

The process has intensified since Mr Trump took office. The US leader shocked Nato allies in May when he failed to reiterate American support for the pact’s Article 5 provision, under which members commit to each other’s mutual defence. Since then, he and other US officials have made more reassuring statements but he has also urged, even more directly than previous US administrations, European members to spend more on defence. He claimed in November that this pressure had yielded results: “Billions and billions of dollars are pouring in,” he said. “Nato, believe me, is very happy with Donald Trump and what I did.”

European countries, who make up the overwhelming majority of Nato members, have signalled that they are taking common security more seriously. All but three of the EU’s 28 member states last month launched the so-called Permanent Structured Cooperation (Pesco) to boost defence co-operation.

A Dutch-led initiative to improve military mobility around Europe, looking at obstacles from red tape to inadequate infrastructure, has been approved under Pesco. It is intended to dovetail with a report on the same subject due from the EU’s European Defence Agency in the spring. Halbe Zijlstra, Dutch foreign minister, has said the military mobility work “should enable the EU to better ensure our own security”.

The flurry of activity reflects the scale of the rethink on the defence of Europe since the Crimea conflict began. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 Nato redirected its operations into international conflicts such as Afghanistan and more recently Libya. US army personnel in Europe fell to just a tenth of its postwar peak of about 300,000, as Washington’s focus shifted to Afghanistan, Iraq and the rise of China.

Now the Nato alliance has set up what it styles a deterrent air, land and sea presence in its eastern member states.

There is a “tripwire” first line of defence of about 4,500 Nato troops in forward bases in Poland and the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Since 2015, a US armoured brigade of about 3,300 personnel has been based on rotation in Europe.

The relatively small size of the alliance’s eastern resources inevitably leads to the question of what would happen if Russia, or another power, decided to test Nato’s strength. Russian troops could be on the outskirts of Tallinn, Estonia’s capital, within 60 hours of an attack starting, a study by the Rand Corporation claimed in 2016. Nato says a “spearhead” reinforcement contingent of 5,000 troops could start deploying anywhere in Europe “within days”. This year the spearhead force will be led by Italy, whose capital Rome is more than 2,000km from Tallinn.

The logistical problems run deeper than distance. In central and eastern Europe, where many countries were either in the Soviet Union or part of its Warsaw Pact, infrastructure is sometimes sparse or dilapidated. Bridges, tunnels, roads, railways and ports in western Europe have not been constructed in the past 25 years to carry large numbers of heavy US military vehicles. “They are no longer building bridges in Europe with a 70-tonne capacity capable of supporting the weight of an Abrams tank,” observes Doug Lute, former US permanent representative to Nato.

The quantity and variety of glitches is intimidating: a six-hour delay to shipments crossing between Poland and Lithuania due to a change in rail gauge; the obstacles military vehicles face clearing the many Polish railway stations that have only one siding (Warsaw says most stations have more than one); the limitations of Bremerhaven, a German North Sea port, where access is via a single road gate that allows only a total of 1,500 vehicles per day in and out.

The investment the EU and Nato make in improving and reviving infrastructure will ultimately be a “political decision”, says Michael Linick, a contributor to the Rand report. “The more aggressive their posture towards Russia, the more necessary this is.”",True,0,1514879509,,False,0,ds2lnja,True,t3_7nkzy1,t3_7nkzy1,/r/ukpolitics/comments/7nkzy1/natos_logistical_battle_to_deter_russia/ds2lnja/,1517483631,9,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,public,

&gt; No Use for a Name (often abbreviated NUFAN) was a punk rock band from San Jose, California. They were formed in 1987 by Tony Sly and Rory Koff. The band is highly praised in the skate punk and hardcore scenes, though their sound has evolved considerably through the years, taking on a much lighter and poppier brand of melodic punk.

&gt; NUFAN's debut album, Incognito, was released in 1990 through New Red Archives. The band has released a single and one more full-length on this label, until signing up with Fat Mike's label, Fat Wreck Chords, on 1993. At that year, No Use For a Name released its first record on Fat, The Daily Grind, which turned to be a highly successful album.

&gt; In 1995, After the release of Leche Con Carne, their fourth full-length, Chris Shiflett (now in the Foo Fighters and Me First and the Gimme Gimmes) and Matt Riddle (also in Pulley) joined the band to play Guitar and Bass, respectively. In 1997, after the success of Making Friends, the band went on a worldwide tour through U.S., Europe, Australia, Canada, and Japan.

&gt; Chris left the band to play in the Foo Fighters, so now they have Dave Nassie playing guitar

&gt; The band released their 8th full-length album, titled Keep Them Confused, on June 14th, 2005. It takes a more political, philosophical and religious position than earlier releases.

&gt; A greatest hits collection titled All the Best Songs was released on July 10, 2007.

&gt; A new fourteen song full-length studio album entitled The Feel Good Record of the Year was released on April 1, 2008. In 2009, when promoting the album in Europe, Dave Nassie left the band to join the ranks of Bleeding Through. In August 2009 the band announced, that they replaced Nassie with Lagwagon's guitarist and founding member of RKL, Chris Rest.

&gt; In December of 2010, Rory Koff announced to the band he would need time off from touring to go full time with his snowplow business and eventually was replaced by new full-time drummer Boz Rivera (of King City, RKL, and The Mad Caddies.). Koff was the last remaining member of the original 1987 No Use for a Name line up.

&gt; Since 2010, No Use for a Name has been working on a new album.
Tony Sly tragically passed away on August 1, 2012. Read more on Last.fm.

mysunandst4rs,,,"Let me clarify, Indian communities will definitely accept and welcome you if you’re Indian at all (albeit identifiable - white looking American Indians may face some challenges, just how it is). Tribal/Intertribal communities don’t outwardly discriminate on blood quantum because nobody knows how much you are unless you tell them honestly.

Tribes in the U.S. have enrollment. This stems from the Dawes Rolls from the Dawes Act or the Indian Allotment Act where the federal government broke up reservations in an effort to separate families and communities. Each head of household was allotted a set amount of land. 

Tribes are seen as sovereign entities to the government. We have our own tribal governments, tribal elections, services, etc. Part of our sovereignty is deciding who is a part of the tribe (for enrollment purposes) by blood quantum requirements. Some have 1/4 blood, an 1/8 blood, or simply if you can prove your ancestors were on the Dawes Rolls some tribes will accept that. So when you’re enrolled in a tribe you have access to their services such as health clinics, education grants, assistance, etc. This came from the Indian Reorganization Act where the US government decided tribes needed to have governments modeled after European governments as opposed to chiefs or sachems and the like.

Many, many people, especially in the state of Oklahoma, identify as multiple tribes. Such as I’m tribe A, tribe B and tribe C, but I’m only enrolled as tribe C. Tribes typically have a rule that you can only be enrolled in one tribe.

A few Indians go to the UK and (let's pretend Indians have a poor grasp of English and don't understand people explaining that they're not Chinese) and start referring to the Brits as ""Chinese.""

Then all of a sudden, a bunch of Indians come on ships and rape the shit out of the UK, destroy half the country, replace it with their version of a civilization they start calling ""superior"" and now 2 billion Indians live in the UK and have also dubbed themselves to be ""Chinese"" because ""they built the country.""

Eventually they realize they're in the UK and not China and start calling the place the UK instead.

Then imagine you're a Chinese person (from China) that goes and lives in the UK. Of course the Indians treat you like shit for no reason and can hardly differentiate you with the Japanese, whose imperialism was horrible for you and attacked the living fuck out of your country and while you don't think they're bad people, you think it's dumb you guys are lumped together politically and socially. 

So you're British-Chinese. Except that doesn't make any sense because that term is referring to the white British that were originally called Chinese by the Indians. So what do you call yourself?

This is a completely different matter and we weren't discussing about this, so I won't bother answering to that.

&gt; You know why they moved their headquarters? Because they want to be sure they won't be left out if someone decides to, i dunno, declare independence overnight over a sham result of an illegal referendum.

Then explain why exactly zero foreign companies decided to move HQs. Some companies (namely Seat) even denounced pressures by the Spanish government to move HQs. Come on, it's pretty obvious that this whole move is just a play to make it seem like an independent Catalonia is not viable economically. 

And sham result of a referendum? Sorry? The elections two weeks ago got more pro-independence votes than the referendum (without even counting Catalunya en Comú which has a percentage of pro-independence votes), how can you justify that? The referendum was perfectly valid and the incidences were minimal and did not affect the result at all.

&gt; You may not know this but if we split, we won't have access to the EU free market, on which a lot of companies depend on;

Nobody can really know what will happen with certainty. However the fact that many companies have said that they are not worried about a Catalan republic, and the fact that Catalonia is growing very fast economically leads me to believe that this will not be a problem and that the EU will agree to some kind of deal to keep the Catalan market (they won't risk giving such a gift to other world powers like China or Russia).

&gt;In conclusion, it is inconceivable that any EU exporter would wish for any disruption in their trade with the UK on Brexit. And it is almost certain that the key EU governments, not least of all the German government, would act in their economic interests.

The first sentence is a given, but the second is not.  Germany doesn't have to act in it's best economic interests if political interests are higher - see the UK exiting Europe for details on such an idea.

&gt;The UK has a strong hand in any trade negotiations in the interim period between a Brexit vote, the triggering of Article 50 and Brexit itself. Not merely would our major EU trading partners wish for a trade agreement, but they would also be likely to push for such an agreement to be finalised expeditiously, prior to the UK’s departure. 

Again a given, the states of Europe would all like a deal as fast as possible, but she couldn't/didn't foresee how long it would take to get to the stage we are at.

&gt;It would simply not be in their commercial interests to prolong the negotiations. And, given that the UK would be negotiating as a fully harmonised EU member, this should not be impossible.

Catalonia is not as important a *gift* (wow) as the UK, and the EU couldn't care less about them now. They're on their own and probably will be made an example of. There is no deal to be made.

PLanPLan,,,"*The close connections between ‘remain’ campaigns, their donors and suppliers*


As Britain Stronger in Europe approached its spending limit in the final weeks of the referendum
period, many other campaigns were established which spent significant sums to campaign to
remain in the EU. Five campaigns which only registered as permitted participants in the final month
of the referendum period received a total of £1,001,000 in donations.


Adam and Eve registered as a permitted participant on 25 May 2016 as an independent campaign
as DDB UK Ltd, less than a month before the referendum. DDB UK Ltd received £191,000 in
donations.

Best For Our Future registered as a permitted participant on 27 May 2016, less than a month
before the referendum. It received £424,000 in donations

Proud Robinson Ltd registered as a permitted participant as The In Crowd on 10 June 2016, less
than two weeks before the referendum. It received £76,000 in donations.

Virgin Management Ltd registered as a permitted participant on 3 June 2016, less than three
weeks before the referendum. It received £210,000 in donations.

Wake Up And Vote registered as a permitted participant on 24 May 2016, less than a month before
the referendum. It received £100,000 in donations.


Although the legislation places no limits on the number of permitted participants that may be
registered on each side, it is reasonable to infer in all the circumstances that some of these
campaigns were established for the purpose of evading the statutory scheme for the control of
campaign expenditure in PPERA 2000. Of particular interest is DDB UK Ltd. Its registered address
was the same as Adam and Eve’s and its responsible person was Adam and Eve’s Chief Executive
James Murphy. Britain Stronger in Europe spent £7,467.60 with Adam and Eve on 1 June 2016,
while Wake Up And Vote spent £24,000 on Adam and Eve on 28 June.


Further evidence from which an inference may be drawn of common plan expenditure is the use of
common suppliers by the various ‘remain’ campaigns. M&amp;C Saatchi acted as a supplier to both
Britain Stronger in Europe, which spent £57,600 on the advertising agency, and Conservatives IN
which spent £4,029.81. The In Crowd spent £34,375.20 on Build Hollywood Ltd, whilst We Are
Europe spent £54,000 on the same company. Freud Communications offered its services to The In
Crowd at a cost of £64,431.78, and to We Are Europe for £30,000. In addition, Goodstuff
Communications acted as a supplier to both The In Crowd, which spent £55,215 on the agency,
and We Are Europe which spent £6,000.

Of the five apparently independent campaigns which registered in the month before polling day,
85% of the donations they received came from persons who had already donated to other ‘remain’
campaigns, as the table below shows:




Lord Sainsbury’s role in particular merits close examination. He donated £2,915,734 to Britain
Stronger in Europe. In addition, he donated £815,000 to campaigns which registered in the month
before the referendum.


It appears that Lord Sainsbury had an active role in the management of these campaigns, as well
as financing them. His first donation to Best For Our Future of £50,000 took place on 24 May 2016,
three days before it registered as a permitted participant, suggesting he was instrumental in its
establishment. Sir Craig Oliver admits at page 77 of his memoir having meetings in early February
2016 at Great North Street ‘which is where David Sainsbury has some offices’ to coordinate the
Government’s research and communications activity with Britain Stronger in Europe’s. Given the
 sensitive nature of discussions between the Government (which at that time had no formal position
on EU membership) and a major ‘remain’ campaign, it is reasonable to infer that Lord Sainsbury
was closely acquainted with sensitive details of campaign strategy given his offices were used for a
meeting of this kind.


The close connections between the various ‘remain’ campaigners, their suppliers and donors
outlined above suggest that it is reasonable to infer that there may have been communications or
other coordination between them about who would incur referendum expenses and on what,
especially in the period when the lead campaigner, Britain Stronger in Europe approached its
spending limit. It is very unlikely that these close connections were the product of coincidence or
happenstance. The connections appears to be further evidence from which it may be inferred that
(i) Britain Stronger in Europe exceeded its spending limit contrary to section 118(2) of PPERA
2000, and (ii) it and other campaigns gave false spending returns, contrary to section 122(4) of
PPERA 2000.


*Conclusion*


The Commission may investigate a complaint pursuant to its Enforcement Policy where it has a
reasonable suspicion an offence has been committed and where it is in the public interest to
investigate. The evidence in support of this complaint plainly gives rise (at the very least) to a
reasonable suspicion that contraventions of PPERA 2000 have occurred. Given the scale of these
apparent contraventions, the public interest in ensuring that referendums are conducted fairly and
in accordance with the law, and the high profile nature of the 2016 referendum in particular, it
seems that it is plainly in the public interest that the Commission investigates this complaint.


I would be grateful if you would acknowledge receipt of this complaint by return and look forward to
the outcome of your assessment.

MinTamor,,,"&gt; Seems like a terrific waste.

Well, look at it this way. 

At the moment, British taxpayers have to pay officials at the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work in Bilbao, the European Environment Agency in Copenhagen, the European Food Safety Authority in Parma, and more than 30 other similar EU agencies. 

Most of these replicate functions already performed by British regulators such as the Food Standards Agency and HSE. Isn't that duplication not a bit wasteful in itself? 

Moreover, let's assume that the EU agencies take some of the workload off the British ones, who will have to hire more staff post-Brexit. 

These are reasonably solid, well-paying jobs that could be given to British workers in deprived areas of Britain. They will pay their taxes here, and buy things from British shops, and support local businesses. What they cost the taxpayer is not money that is flying out of the window. 

Whereas paying EU officials in Parma and Bilbao to do the same thing is, in fact, money that flies out of Britain and never comes back. Particularly as EU agencies have a [poor record] (https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmselect/cmfaff/219/219.pdf) in hiring British workers. 

&gt; Integrated supply chains are a fact of life, are they unpatriotic?

Old news and already discussed in Italy since the summer of 2015,** few months after the beginning of the yemeni conlfict between the shiite Houthi militias and the forces of the Arab League lead by Riad.

**Thousands of airplane bombs (including inert training copies) produced by the factory of RWM of Domusnavas, in Sulcis** (currently in phase of expansions thanks to the investments of Rheinmetall for 40 millions of euros), **have been sold to the saudi air forces that are consuming them intensevly** in a war that [the leadership] in Riad delude themselves thinking that it would end quickly and almost painlessly and that instead risks to transform itself in the “saudi’s Vietnam”. 

**Indeed, after just 5 months of war the saudi fighter-bombers Typhonn and Tornado had already exhausted their supply of guided bombs and in the august of 2015 the british Royal Air Force gave to the Royal Saudi Air Force their stock of Paveway IV (bombs like the ones produced by RWM to which has been applied the laser/gps guidance kit made by the american Raytheon).**

**A concession that risked to leave without bombs the british jets deployed in the fight against the islamic state in Iraq and Syria but that couldn’t be refused to a golden ally such as the saudis that in Great Britain had bought a large part of their aircarft fleet, the fighetrs-bombers Tornado and Typhoon made by european consortia that Italy is also part of.**

**“We aren’t directely partecipating in the saudi operations in Yemen but we are giving technincal support, precision bombs and information exchanges with the saudi forces in base of the previous accords” had explained the 14 of july 2015 the minister of defence answering to an interrogation by the House of Commons.**

Cheapo-Git,,I'll have Hard Boiled Eggs and Gherkins with it.,"&gt; But we have an absolutely gargantuan trade deficit with the EU

And?  We have a massive trade deficit with China, too.

With the EU, it's only in Goods, anyway.  In services, the largest sector of our economy, we have a surplus with the EU.


Having that trade deficit with the EU is far better than having it with countries that have an almost slave workforce, at least the EU are on a similar level when trading products that we also produce here, since it lets our domestic industries (which are likely to have a higher production cost than many non-EU nations) trade their goods here and the EU on a relatively level playing field.

The EU are our closest and largest trade neighbours, and have similar values and economy type and a shared history, and it's a massive market, that's just 50 miles away, or an hour on the train and is a single market.

A lot of that trade deficit is food. And we can't be *totally* domestically self sufficient, so if we trade unlimited zero tariff food goods with non-eu countries that have enormous factory farms or those that pay their workers next to nothing, it would kill our agricultural industries, many are already barely scraping through with all the Subsidies they get.

But having a reasonable amount of sufficiency in food is important, because you don't need to worry so much about environmental or conflict issues around the world, and also when trading with other nations if all your agriculture has disappeared, they won't have you in a throat hold knowing you're relying on them just for your food.

Other sectors we still have may also be priced out of existence at, akin to when having Chinese imports pretty much ended many of the the majority of factories we had here that built TVs, VCRs, Radios (other electronics) and many of other household goods and utensils.


&gt; in fact we have a trade surplus with Non-EU countries

Are we going to make a deal with 'The World outside the EU'?

The band experienced the usual member changes for a new band, as Denner left (and later returned). In addition, the drummer position was a revolving door, but Kim Ruzz finally established himself as the drummer.

&gt; Several demos and live shows survive from 1981, including their infamous first concert ""Sabbath of all witches"" held in early/mid 1981.

&gt; In early 1982, the band contributed to the Ebony Records sampler Metallic Storm. Later on in the year, Mercyful Fate recorded its first official release, Mercyful Fate, on vinyl for the Dutch label Rave On. The release included heavy and evil material that would later inspire the black metal genre (although Venom and Bathory are as equally considered as the forefathers of black metal).

&gt; Following the EP, the band released Melissa in 1983 and Don't Break the Oath in 1984, which are now considered by many to be classics in both the power metal and black metal genres. Following the tour (which saw them play in the United States for the first time) in support of Don't Break the Oath, Diamond split ways with Mercyful Fate in April 1985 as a result of frustration over creative differences with Hank Shermann. With him, Diamond brought band mates Hansen and Denner to found a new band under his own name. Diamond's new venture continued the tradition of Mercyful Fate, but with a more progressive, conceptual twist to it. In response, Hank Shermann formed the band Fate, which pursued a more AOR direction.

&gt; Reunion

&gt; In July 1992, the band reformed and signed a contract with Brian Slagel's Metal Blade Records. All the original members without Kim Ruzz (replaced by Morten Nielsen) reformed and released In the Shadows in 1993. The album featured a re-recording of ""Return of the Vampire"", with Metallica drummer and Mercyful Fate enthusiast Lars Ulrich playing on the track. In the years since, the band has released four other albums, with the last being 9. Similar to the band's first run, members have left and been replaced; Michael Denner left and was replaced by Mike Wead, Drummer Nielsen was later replaced by Snowy Shaw who was then replaced by Bjarne Holm, Bassist Timi Hansen left quickly and was replaced by Sharlee D'Angelo. Following the release of 9 (1999), King Diamond put Mercyful Fate on hold and continued his solo career. Shermann, Denner, Holm and (King Diamond Bass player) Hal Patino formed Force of Evil, which incorporates many of the themes of the original Mercyful Fate.

&gt; In a March, 2008 interview, King Diamond stated that Mercyful Fate is currently ""hibernating"", but had never split up. Though he does not know when the band will become active again, he said ""It's definitely not finished, at least in my book."". With the Re-union in 1993, the same lineup returned for the album and European tour, with the exception of Drummer Kim Ruzz, who was replaced by Snowy Shaw. Bassist Timi Hansen also left after the European leg of the tour, and was replaced by Sharlee D'Angelo.

&gt; The Lineup remained the same for ""Time"" and ""Into the Unknown"". Snowy Shaw was then replaced by Bjarne Holm on drums.

&gt; Unfortunatley, Michael Denner had also parted ways with the band at this point, to stay with his wife and family. His replacement was Mike Wead, who recorded with the band for ""Dead Again"" As well as ""9"" and has proven to be a sufficient replacement for Michael Denner.

&gt; Melissa

&gt; ""Melissa"" is the name of a skull King Diamond used to carry on stage, and also a fictional deceased witch that appears in three songs. Before the recordings of the album Melissa, King Diamond had acquired a human skeleton that he named ""Melissa"". He used the femur bones to make his trademark microphone handle. The skull was apparently stolen during a show in the Netherlands.

&gt; The skull was inspiration behind the album Melissa, and the title track of the album is very different from the rest of the album, as it is much slower than the other songs (which are speedier and more aggressive). The lyrics tell of a male protagonist (usually identified as King Diamond himself by fans) who lost the love of his life, who was a witch who was burnt at the stake by a Catholic priest. The story builds itself up around the emotions of the protagonist, who first feels sadness and uncertainty, hope for her to still be alive, and then rage over his loss. He swears revenge on the priest who burnt her, proclaiming that he must die in the name of hell. The song ends with a whisper that hints Melissa's spirit is still with the protagonist.

&gt; The second song Melissa appears on is on the album Don't Break the Oath in the song ""Come to the Sabbath"", once again at the climax of the album. The lyrics tell about a Satanic coven holding a sabbath, in which the protagonist emerges to perform a ritual to ""put an evil curse on the priest who took the life of Melissa"". Though she is not the focus of the lyrics this time, because of her mention the song is known as a ""Melissa song"". Additionally, one of the main characters on the King Diamond's album Them was named ""Missy"", which is a common diminutive of Melissa.

&gt; The final song Melissa appears in is on Mercyful Fate's reunion album In the Shadows on the song ""Is That You, Melissa?"". The lyrics tell of the protagonist once again in sorrow about the loss of his love. He begins to hear her voice and goes to the coven to have them perform a ritual to speak with her ghost. The coven objects, saying that it is against the rules. The protagonist is visited by Melissa's spirit who shares a kiss with the protagonist. The subject of the song is argued by some; one side says the lyrics are not a continuation of the Melissa story but a tribute by the band to their past, while the other side sees it as the end of the Melissa story. It is widely accepted that she is the girl on the album cover of ""In the Shadows"" facing the old oak tree. After In the Shadows, Melissa has not been mentioned any more in both lyrics and artwork.

Frobeniu5,,,"The older Iranian generation has no realistic concept of politics and citizenship. Their understanding of government is that some person, group, or party has absolute power and total responsibility. This is because they have historically had little exposure to how a democracy functions. There's a cultural tendency, reflected in Shia Islam also, of waiting for some heroic person to take control and fix everything. They're waiting for a savior.

During the Shah's time, they thought if Khomeini ""took over"" and had full control, everything would be fixed. It obviously didn't turn out that way, but rather than reflecting and realizing the entire expectation is ill-founded, they now want someone else to take over and fix everything. 

The Pahlavi guy is more or less a blank slate so people project their ideas onto him. A bit like how Khomeini was a blank slate to some degree, but with much less actual leadership and charisma. Most of his supporters are Iranians who left Iran right after the revolution and who live in some sort of time bubble, completely oblivious to the deep social changes that have occurred since.

Most Iranians in Iran have never lived under a Shah. Pre-revolution Iran might as well be pre-Islamic Persia to them, something out of history books. At the same time, the younger generation has grown up exposed to Western media, and with access to information via internet, and has a much better understanding of how politics is done in Europe and the US. They have a much more sound conception of how citizens partake in government, and how power is held responsible. Expecting this generation to accept a Shah is more or less like expecting Americans to rejoin the British Empire. Expecting them to support MEK is like expecting them to join the Westboro Baptist Church. It's so mind-numbingly absurd that it becomes hard to explain.

Jefferson states it quite well in this letter from Paris to an anti-federalist dated 1/16/1787. Thing is, we're never ever going to be able to force people to read what they're """"supposed to read"""", but we can publish arguments. I think I'm more secure in knowing there are more people who aren't fooled by the b.s. than people who are. (edit: like those so called ""Jeffersonian Republicans"" who hate poor people so much on Facebook, heh)

&gt;The tumults in America, I expected would have produced in Europe an unfavorable opinion of our political state. But it has not. On the contrary, the small effect of those tumults seems to have given more confidence in the firmness of our governments. The interposition of the people themselves on the side of government has had a great effect on the opinion here. I am persuaded myself that the good sense of the people will always be found to be the best army. They may be led astray for a moment, but will soon correct themselves. The people are the only censors of their governors: and even their errors will tend to keep these to the true principles of their institution. To punish these errors too severely would be to suppress the only safeguard of the public liberty. **The way to prevent these irregular interpositions of the people is to give them full information of their affairs thro’ the channel of the public papers, and to contrive that those papers should penetrate the whole mass of the people**. The basis of our governments being the opinion of the people, the very first object should be to keep that right; and were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter. But I should mean that every man should receive those papers and be capable of reading them. I am convinced that those societies (as the Indians) which live without government enjoy in their general mass an infinitely greater degree of happiness than those who live under European governments. Among the former, public opinion is in the place of law, and restrains morals as powerfully as laws ever did any where. Among the latter, under pretence of governing they have divided their nations into two classes, wolves and sheep. I do not exaggerate. This is a true picture of Europe. Cherish therefore the spirit of our people, and keep alive their attention. **Do not be too severe upon their errors, but reclaim them by enlightening them. If once they become inattentive to the public affairs, you and I, and Congress, and Assemblies, judges and governors shall all become wolves.

&gt;Inspiring young people to serve others


&gt;1 January 2004


&gt;HLUBOKA, Czech Republic — A six-day gathering to inspire Baha'i youth to make their contribution to the welfare of humanity attracted participants from more than 30 countries.


&gt;The world's suffering was a ""call to action,"" a keynote speaker told participants at the ""Changing Times"" seminar, which was held at the [Townshend International School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townshend_International_School) here from 26 December 2003 to 1 January 2004.


&gt;""Today we are witnessing the disintegration of international order,"" said [Robert Henderson](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnThisDateInBahai/comments/6p1gti/july_23_on_this_date_in_1995_the_nsa_of_the_us/), the secretary-general of the [National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_Faith_in_the_United_States).



&gt;""Sovereign states are unable to stop the spread of terrorism and war, to stabilize the world economy or to alleviate the sufferings of millions,"" said [Dr. Henderson](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnThisDateInBahai/comments/6p1gti/july_23_on_this_date_in_1995_the_nsa_of_the_us/), drawing on analysis by Shoghi Effendi and messages from the Universal House of Justice.


&gt;[Baha'i youth](https://bahaikipedia.org/Junior_Youth_Group), he said, should strive to become examples of the transforming power of Baha'u'llah.


&gt;They should ""elevate the atmosphere"" in which they live, face challenges with confidence and become the embodiment of excellence in their personal lives, academic training, professions, and spiritual qualities.


&gt;The atmosphere of the seminar was characterized by the joy and camaraderie of the some 220 participants. In addition to the many [European Baha'is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_Faith_in_Europe), attendees came from places as far away as Canada, the United States, Australia, and New Zealand.


&gt;The program also featured a talk by [Hamid Peseschkian](https://www.peseschkian.com/en/dr-hamid-peseschkian.html), a psychiatrist who spoke on marriage preparation, and Lesley Taherzadeh, who addressed aspects of Baha'i history.


&gt;Ms. Taherzadeh spoke about the heroes and heroines of the Faith -- and she offered a moving tribute to her late husband, [Adib Taherzadeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adib_Taherzadeh), a renowned Baha'i author who served on the Universal House of Justice.


&gt;[Ardawan Lalui](http://www.lalui.com/about-us.html), the project director of the [Townshend School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townshend_International_School), spoke about applying Baha'i principles to the workplace.



&gt;Topics by other speakers included the importance of ethics in business and the equality of men and women.


&gt;Workshops aimed at inspiring the youth to incorporate Baha'i principles into their lives included a focus on two current themes in Baha'i activities worldwide -- the arts in Baha'i community life (led by [Inder Manocha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inder_Manocha)), and the importance of devotional meetings (led by Katrina Modabber).


&gt;Both of those workshop topics were illustrated in the program itself. Among the artistic performances were those by international prize-winning violinists [Martha](https://www.martha-khadem-missagh.com/) and [Vahid Khadem-Missagh](http://www.khadem-missagh.com/), who performed with their father, [Bijan](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijan_Khadem-Missagh), at the official opening of the Terraces of the Shrine of the Bab in Haifa in May 2001.




&gt;Stand-up comedian [Inder Manocha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inder_Manocha), who performed at the ""Best of the Edinburgh Festival Showcase"" and has appeared on BBC programs, provided an evening of comedy.


&gt;A devotional meeting, in which music and the arts provided an uplifting atmosphere, was one of the highlights of the seminar.


&gt;The seminar was dedicated to two much beloved Baha'is who passed away in 2003 -- the Hand of the Cause of God [Ali-Akbar Furutan](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnThisDateInBahai/comments/7fv4bo/november_26_on_this_date_in_2003_alíakbar_furútan/), and former member of the Universal House of Justice [David Hofman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hofman).


&gt;The Changing Times seminar, organized by [European Baha'i](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_Faith_in_Europe) youth, was first held in 2002 and is scheduled to become an annual event.

No - I mean before Disney came along and destroyed decades of amazing stories instead of adapting them properly. There's no reason why they couldn't have made the EU ""Legends"" canon while still cleaning it up and porting it over. Almost every concept they've imported from the Disney versions has been in some way ripped from the EU and subsequently watered down to make it less impressive. 

For example, Anakin Solo went so fucking hard that he literally became one with the Force while fighting - his body was *emitting the motherfucking force* while he took out the Voxxin - sound familiar? 

While still wracked with grief over his little brother's death, Jacen Solo becomes Darth Caedus in order to save his daughter and wife, and his own twin sister had to fucking kill him because he refused to return to the light. This is a much better story than ""Ben Solo falls the dark side *just because* and softly strokes the hands of Rey Random.""

Luke winds up marrying a reformed Sith apprentice named Mara Jade and has a son named Ben Skywalker - you know, the person who actually *should have named his kid Ben* actually did (because Han hated Obi-Wan and Leia never even fucking met the dude). Then Mara is subsequently murdered by Jacen to complete his ascent to the dark side stirring up the enmity of his cousin/trainee, Ben Skywalker.

This is a common misconception about Canada. Canada experiences a temperature range of almost 80 degrees Centigrade: from -40 (uncommon, but not unheard of) to +40 (uncommon but not un heard of) 20-30 degrees is the average for an Ontarian summer.

I only have 2 pieces of real advise in relation to visiting Canada and one reality check:

* 1: **DO IT**

* 2: **Bring a lot of money** I've heard that Canada is rather expensive compared to other countries.

* 3: **Canada is MASSIVE!!**

For example, One could visit every country in continental Europe by car within a 24hr period. One could drive NorthWest, from my hometown of Ottawa, for the same 24hr period and only just have left the province of Ontario. It takes Roughly 3 full days to travel from Ontario to British Columbia.

MinTamor,,,"&gt; People seem to enjoy Brie, Carlsberg and Danish bacon, at current prices. 

Well, people are stupid, and sometimes the government needs to protect them from themselves. 

The fact that overpaid Londoners are happy to cut the throats of British regional producers so that they can signal their ""international"" sophistication by drinking Continental Fighting Lagers and driving Maseratis is pretty much Brexit in microcosm. The French behave [rather differently] (https://www.politico.eu/article/belgium-calls-for-eu-help-against-french-gastronationalism/), which is probably why they're richer than we are, have less income and regional inequality and work fewer hours. 

&gt; because the economies of scale mean that decentralized production is more costly

I fear you might just have run out of economics.

You see, as Krugman put it, the EU's Single Market is ""good for Belgium, bad for Spain"". It's sucked stable employment out of the EU's periphery and centralised it in what the IMF calls the German-Central European Supply Chain-Cluster.

Any economies of scale produced by this process are dwarfed by its *diseconomies* of scale. 

You see, the unemployed industrial workers of Lancashire and Navarre do not simply disappear in a puff of smoke. Nor do they  learn Czech and move to Prague, as seems to be the fantasy of Europhile economists. In the real world, that option's really not on the table. It's part of what Richard Thaler calls the distinction between ""Econs"" and ""Humans"". 

Rather, they live on benefits, or in their mum's council flat, or in insecure zero-hour jobs topped up by tax credits. All of which has to be paid for by Britain's increasingly narrow-based economy. 

And as economists like Dani Rodrik have proven, there's no efficient way of forcing the winners from the tariff-reduction process to compensate the losers. The EU's Single Market, like other globalist ventures, has probably produced modest gains in overall output, but these have come at the cost of chronic inter-group dislocation and misery.

DoomChaver,,,"Maine was merged with Massachusetts as part of a revised royal charter in 1691, following the events two major wars between Europeans and indigenous peoples that had a huge impact on both Massachusetts and Maine. 

The first was King Phillip's War (1675-76) in which basically all Europeans (at least the English) were driven out of Southern and Downeast Maine. King Phillip was actually an indigenous leader who has his powerbase in Connecticut but other natives joined his uprising (though I believe that the peoples of Maine didn't get their activities going until Phillip was close to defeated, so for them King Phillip's war was more like 1676-78). 

The second was King William's War (1688-1697) was conflict between France and England that involved their colonies as well as many local indigenous peoples as allies and enemies. This war again saw the depopulation of Europeans in Maine, but I can't remember if they were completely driven out this time.

I of course agree that the current internal cultural crisis in the West is paramount and requires immediate attention from people interested in saving the West. On the other hand, China poses a long-term threat both in terms of hard power (economic/military) and soft power (propaganda, cultural influence, etc.). My general interest lately has been in China per se as a mostly foreign but also domestic threat, one that is rightly a high priority on the Trump agenda. I've been amassing articles on China mostly for self-education and to learn from comments like yours. China's propaganda efforts here and elsewhere in the West are part of the total picture.

Brentford have been one of the most competitive teams in the Championship away from home. Wolves are naturally very strong at Molineux, but I’d be shocked if they’re able to keep Brentford silent. Brentford were scoreless in their first three road matches of the season but have only failed to score in one since then, scoring multiple times in seven of those. I think Wolves will do their part and expect Brentford to compete as well. 

From when I took this bet yesteday, the line has moved considerably to around 1.55. For what it’s worth I think the line will tread back the other direction. We’ll see. I think it’s fine to take it at 2.75 or 3 for better odds but I think there’s a real good chance this one ends like 2-1.

But as I said, which you have yet to counter, this is economists saying that their predictions were wrong, and in doing so blaming Brexit for the misalignment.

Ignoring this bit that was wrong: -

&gt; The pre-referendum estimates of the long-term pain ranged from a hit to the economy of 1 per cent to 9 per cent of national income — an annual loss of gross domestic product of between £20bn and £180bn compared with remaining in the EU.

&gt; Economists for Brexit, a forecasting group, predicted that after a leave vote growth in GDP would expand 2.7 per cent in 2017. The Treasury expected a mild recession. Neither proved correct. The 2017 growth rate appears likely to slow to 1.5 per cent at a time when the global economy is strengthening.

Let's just pick out the bits in the article that you like shall we?

So economic projections from all directions proved to be massively wrong. At least the leave projections showed positive growth, so we're on the right side of the axis on the graph.

Here in my part of Europe, it is normal for children to attend day-care 4/5 times a week, regardless of the parents income or job, from the age of 6 month to 2.5 years. At 2,5 years, they start preschool...

We have no significant more ""tubes"" in Europe than in any other part of the world... We have no more sick children in Europe than in any other part of the world... I will admit my (gifted) daughter had the usual sicknesses but not specially more than any other kid and she started day-care at 5 months...  And those children who skip day-care and only start school at 2.5 years, have not built up their immune system as much as the others and tend to be more sick in their first year of being around other kids...

My daughter is the same age as the daughter of a colleague of mine. My daughter attended day-care, his did not. My daughter was a little bit more self dependent and assertive than his. Mine was more used to be around other children, to demand her place in the pack, to ""fight"" for her right, to stand up to bigger children, to protect her toys and to share the attention of the kindergarten-cop but also to wait for her turn, to share toys and to help and protect smaller kids...

DaveChild,,Lib Dem / Pro EU,"&gt; That counts as a diplomatic triumph; and, yes, a cause for optimism.

It was about six months too late to be considered any sort of triumph. It's progress. Late, underwhelming, but progress nonetheless. 

&gt; I may be the only person who voted for Brexit to get more but fairer immigration. 

Utter bullshit. Leaving the EU makes no sense if you want to liberalise immigration for other nations. It's about bringing down EU immigration, whether you try to dress it up in a ""fairness"" costume or not.

&gt; Brexit had to happen because the EU was plainly unreformable. 

The author must have missed the bit where the EU agreed unprecedented opt-outs and protections for the UK against further integration and pressure on us to join the Euro.

I like how people think that ""culture"" is what breeds variety.

It breeds the opposite. What culture creates is different bland homogenous places next to each other where all the people are the same and next to it is another bland place where all the people are the same in a different way.

""culture"" is a fancy way of saying ""I feel the need to do things and believe things purely because my parents did it.""; it creates homogeneity.

Okay, here's a better argument:

Torch it all because it's fucking stupid to continue with ""traditions"" just because ""that's how we always did it"" even when it makes no sense. Actions should have merit on their own self.

Following traditions is the hallmark of a fool.

When the european conquistadors got in the new land, they would have sex with natives and blacks (sometime later).

So you can even see this (miscigenation) as more of a trend to portuguese and spanish, while the english and french used to put ""family starter packs"" on the ships so they could populate the new lands with people from the country of origin.

So the french and englishman were also interested in colonize the new lands, while the portuguese and spanish were only interested in get the goods from the new lands back to europe.

Later in colonial Brazil for instance, it were not uncommon that the white landlord used the black women slaves as 'ama-de-leite', to feed their newborn with breast milk. This in turn would make the children of white people having emotional bonds with some blacks. Also white landlords would use some women slaves to have inter-marital sex, given birth to a 'mulato' children.

It was really a slow social construction with different outcomes compared to other countries with slavery.

&gt;**Esse é o valor médio que os brasileiros com até 25 anos de idade vão repassar ao governo ao longo da vida para cobrir os déficits do INSS e da aposentadoria dos servidores federais**  


&gt; Essas cifras, vale reforçar, se referem somente ao custo para cobrir o déficit previdenciário, isto é, para tapar o enorme buraco que já existe – e crescerá – entre a arrecadação de contribuições e o pagamento de benefícios. Além de honrar essa “dívida”, os jovens brasileiros também terão de fazer as devidas contribuições para custear sua própria aposentadoria, via INSS, regimes próprios do funcionalismo ou previdência privada. Os números constam de um relatório do Tesouro Nacional que estima o chamado resultado atuarial, cálculo contábil que traz para valor presente as receitas e compromissos futuros do sistema previdenciário. LEIA TAMBÉM: Governo terá de elevar impostos para cobrir o rombo O estudo, publicado em novembro, aponta para um déficit atuarial de R$ 9,23 trilhões na soma do INSS com o regime próprio dos servidores civis da União. Em outras palavras, nas próximas décadas o país terá de gastar o equivalente a um ano e meio de geração de riquezas para compensar o rombo no pagamento de aposentadorias e pensões desses dois regimes. As aposentadorias, pensões e benefícios assistenciais pagos pelo regime geral, que há três anos representavam 40,8% de todas as despesas primárias (não relacionadas à dívida) da União, hoje consomem 48,3% desse dinheiro. “Será necessário aumentar a carga tributária em aproximadamente 8,5% do PIB nos próximos 40 anos, ou reduzir, na mesma proporção, outras despesas, inclusive as demais da Seguridade Social”, alerta o relatório.

Nheea,,,"&gt; Asa functioneaza o obligatie, chiar daca nu o sa intre cineva in casa peste tine, amenzi peste amenzi (care ar putea deveni o simpla taxa) sau chiar inchisoarea lasa oamenii fara alternative, este ca si cand eu te-as intreba, imi dai si mie putin din banii tai? In timp ce raspunsul nu atrage dupa sine sanctiuni pe care nu poti sa ti le permiti.

DACA legea te-ar fi fortat sa-ti faci rau, intelegeam. Dar legea protejeaza un copil nevinovat, ii da o sansa in plus la viata cu fiecare vaccin. Deci nu e ca si cand te obliga sa-ti dai foc, ci sa ai grija de o fiinta care nu se poate ingriji singura. Daca nu voiai sa faci asta, atunci nu trebuia sa faci copil. Nu ai grija de el? Platesti. Prin amenda sau ridicarea drepturilor parentale, care nu-s mai presus de drepturile copilului la viata si sanatate.

&gt;si anume cea de a administra anumite substante cetatenilor pur cu scopul de cercetare sau de imbunatatirea unui alt vaccin

te rog eu, nu mai inventa chestii. Vaccinurile sunt testate de sute de ori pana sunt puse pe piata. 

&gt;care isi abuzeaza cetatenii, si chiar daca ti se pare ca acest lucru nu s-ar putea intampla, chiar daca s-a intamplat in tari civilizate de-a lungul istoriei, argumentul are o baza logica.

Nu zic nu. S-au intampla nenorociri, dar nu se mai intampla acum.

De ex in cazul vaccinurilor, regulile cercetarii si testarii lor sunt ff aspre, de-aia multi si abandoneaza productiile unor vaccinuri sau testarea unor noi vaccinuri. Nu renteaza. Chit ca ar fi fost in beneficiul populatiei. Dar regulile nu mai sunt ca pe vremea lu' bunicu' iar vaccinurile nu se produc pe repede inainte si ilegal sau nesigur (gen Polidinul de la Cantacuzino care a fost testat pe cei care-l produceau, nu pe vreun alt lot de oameni. Nu era prea etic sau sigur!).

Deci asta pica. Se mai pot intampla lucruri neplacute, de ex faza cu vaccinul BCG de acum cativa ani, cand s-a adus vaccinul cu tulpina din Danemarca, pt ca ai nostri nu-l mai aveau. iar tulpina respectiva a fost mult mai reactogena, si deci au exista multe reactii adverse neplacute. Dar nu a murit nimeni, vaccinul a fost retras de la noi si aia e. A fost o situatie naspa, cauzata de ineficienta si incompetenta statului, care nu a comandat la timp vaccinuri. Nici vorba de intentii rele sa sufere populatia.

&gt;Simplu, pentru ca bebelusul apartine/este in grija acelui parinte si astfel el este autoritatea pentru ce i se intampla copilului sau. 

Nimeni nu apartine nimanui. Ca nu suntem animale. Parintele are obligatia sa isi creasca spawn-ul. Nu inseamna ca-i apartine.

&gt;atunci mi se pare ca statul pur si simplu nu este indreptatit sa faca acea decizie.

ti se pare.

&gt;Ca riscul trebuie evaluat de catre cel care isi asuma rezultatul, in acest caz parintele.

Pe baza caror cunostinte? De pe site-uri de genul bucovinaprofunda?

Puhleease!

&gt;Intreb in mod sincer pentru ca nu stiu ce sa cred, daca vaccinurile de acel tip ar fi fost obligatorii, s-ar fi vaccinat toti copiii? pentru ca ai zis ca spre deosebire de acest vaccin cel ""Hexacima"" este recuperat, de ce exista aceasta diferenta?

Nu prea pricep ce vrei sa spui.

S-ar fi vaccinat copii ai caror parinti ar fi fost de acord. 

Diferenta exista cel mai probabil din cauza zvonurile legate de MMR/ROR, care e vaccinul celebru pe care nemernicul de [Andrew Wakefield](https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield) l-ar fi acuzat ca provoaca autism.

Desi zvonul a fost infirmat de mult si ""lucrarea stiintifica"" retrasa de mult si dezmintita prin zeci sau sute de alte studii care nu gasesc acea corelatie, parintii inca se tem de acest vaccin.

Pe grupul de Facebbok pt informare despre vaccinuri, la mai bine de 10 ani dupa ce acest mit a fost infirmat, parintii inca mai aud ca ROR ar produce autism. Deci normal ca lumea fuge de el daca se informeaza de la vecini sau magazin.

ThwartChimes,,,"In what country do you live? I assume the Netherlands?

It's similarly frowned-upon to discuss salary in the US but it's very slowly changing (at least in some industries... mainly tech). There's a growing recognition that salary secrecy suppresses wages. Mixed with the silly salaries of software engineers in the US (even by their own reckoning), I've noticed people have started opening up about what they make.

Something else that might be throwing me off: it seems you're citing pay *after* social security and other taxes? If so, is that a normal approach among European countries? The US almost exclusively cites salary before all applicable taxes. It seems the numbers might actually be a lot closer than I thought.

I've been wanting to move to Europe for a while. For all I know, I might get home sick after a few years and move back, but I'm very undertraveled and really want to spend some time in Europe. Not being able to speak the native language is the biggest hesitation (and, apparently, wages... but maybe I can pull off an internal transfer?).

I did a quick look. It appears about 8% of individuals in the US make over $100,000/yr while roughly 20% of households do the same. I tried to find a similar stat for the Netherlands but had trouble. I wonder if the number you cited is slightly low due to the economic conditions of 2008/2009.

Edit: I found [this website](http://visualisatie.cbs.nl/en-GB/visualisation/inkomensverdeling) that shows disposable income. It claims 1.7% of households in the Netherlands have disposable income above 100K/year Euros. 100K in USD is roughly 83K in Euros. About 3.2% of households have disposable income above 83K.

JDFidelius,,,"&gt;  Can you explain how you mean that costs are minimized here?

I'm going off the assumption that taxpayers wouldn't fund a system that doesn't attempt to minimize costs. This means removing a lot of general education classes that don't contribute to the knowledge that you'll use in your future career, and perhaps also shortening the time in school. It also means larger class sizes and less one-on-one time with professors.

&gt;I'm not sure liberals only take non-economically viable degrees though... But why would they not be able to take them? They wouldn't be able to get a job afterwards, but that's already true. I didn't really understand that point. Do you believe we don't have humanities in Norway?

Humanities and the likes here in the US are nearly exclusively pursued by liberal and leftist minded people. Conservatives are not welcome in a lot of those classes due to professors and students alike shaming them or otherwise not making them feel welcome. I'd imagine it's pretty similar in Norway, if not more exaggerated (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVaTc15plVs go look at what the humanities professors say about their basic assumptions of sex differences).

I would think that, if you are trying to minimize costs of institutions, you would reduce the size of humanities departments unless it is shown that those students do well financially after school *for reasons other than the fact that they come from rich families* (in the US, many liberal arts majors do fine after college because they come from well-to-do families; it's the liberal arts majors that come from middle class and poorer families that get screwed with such majors and have to take a job at Starbucks or McDonalds). A reasonable explanation for the continued hegemony of liberal arts even in a cost-minimized system would thus be societal; Scandinavian and other northern European countries are more humanistic and appreciate the arts more than Americans do, I would say.

&gt;I assume you mean ""social democratic"" here, not ""socialist""?

Yes, I'm not too familiar with the terminology since I haven't taken classes on this stuff, but I'm looking for the word to describe a taxpayer-funded education system that is open to all. Social democratic just by its name seems to be a much more accurate term for this than socialist.

And something about your other comment about the linguistic difference between the state and the government: we also understand ""the state"" to mean ""the goverment"", but it's mostly more intellectual people that use this term, at least in my experience. I think that a big difference between Norway and the US is that ""the government"" feels like this foreign, self-contained entity. Many Americans very much view it as a monolith and not as the sum of millions of fellow Americans working under the same organization. If Norwegians are less likely to view it as a monolith than Americans, I would probably say that it's due to the fact that literally 22 of the 50 states in the US have a larger population than Norway. California alone has almost 40 million people! It's a lot harder for me to view the government not as a monolith when it's millions of people I don't know all partaking in a system. Compare this to the local government, where it is very much viewed as neighbors and locals participating in civil service. The massive scale of the governments in the US is what leads to 'the government' being a foreign entity (I know that your comment was about 'state' vs. 'government' but I just wanted to throw this in there too).",True,0,1514918374,,False,0,ds38u5b,False,t3_7nhl2d,t1_ds373wl,/r/todayilearned/comments/7nhl2d/til_if_you_publish_a_book_in_norway_the/ds38u5b/,1517495233,1,False,todayilearned,t5_2qqjc,public,

&gt; You've elected an unbroken string of pro-war Presidents, Democrats and Republicans alike.

That's not completely true. 

Obama was anti-war, he inherited Iraq/Afghanistan. And the reality is we create bad vacuums when we bail. Hence ISIS. Look at Japan, Germany and South Korea and notice how America still hasn't left (though different reasons). I wouldn't call Obama a war monger, I would say he didn't take control over the reckless use of strikes. It seemed like we were killing a lot civilians and the US wasn't really hearing that.

Clinton was also not pro-war at all. The only conflict his 8 years encountered was Serbia. And I'm sure there are a great deal of Americans who don't even remember it. For a war monger he surely acted in the least with the heaviest level of hesitation.

Jimmy wasn't much pro-war either. He inherited a mess and made bad actions. 

I'm not saying that the US isn't war based. I'm saying we don't purposely elect politicians that are war mongers. Some clearly feel that way. But liberals are clearly opposed, it's just they still get dragged in.

&gt; You've spent coming up on ten trillion dollars - that's ten million million dollars - on warfare in this century alone, and yet both parties keep heaping more money into the flames.

I won't argue that our defense spending is ... well ridiculous. However, it's not like we are Saudi Arabia (#3) in which we are buying external items. The US defense complex is almost completely internal. And the only industry regulated and forced to be 100% American (with obvious exceptions). The majority of defense spending is upkeep. So to really hit that down we have to agree to have less standing forces with a lot lower tech equipment. Marines and Coast Guard prove over and over that is possible. But the overwhelming spending is mostly R&amp;D and development. New technology.

The biggest problem is because of the restrictions and the way the defense industry has to operate it's 'seemingly' the biggest bang for your buck when it comes to GDP. Senators and Congress people will routinely back a new DOD project, so long as it brings X jobs to their state. You talk later about this issue, but that's what keeps the DOD spending from being $300-400B instead of the $700B it is now.

It's lazy, but the rationale is clear.

&gt;  And you go out of your way to brutalize anyone who even talks about a third party - even if they explain that they simply can't support D or R because of their reasoned opposition to war.

What? As above, I can't think of a Democrat that was even remotely pro-war in an election process.

We don't like 3rd party voting on election days because despite our constitution having nothing against a multiparty system, historically we have flocked to two parties and invented external rules about 2 parties. Ultimately by the time it matters, it will only be 2 candidates. So you'll hear ""vote for the lesser of two evils"" because as we have seen before (cough 2000 presidential) the third party can cause a lot of harm. You could say an Idiot and Penguin might run your country if you do. 

The issue isn't so much with the alternative parties is that these parties only use a very very small portion of the populace to decide who will be the front runner. Basically 2 idiots go to the grocer to pick up food for a large dinner party. They have hundreds of options, but they pick 2 items each of their own liking. Guest are presented the option for a main course of (1) frozen mini burgers or (2) Chicken Nuggets and Egos. The issue wasn't the grocery store selection, it was the fact that the Dinner Host sent Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb.

So you can get more involved early to avoid Chicken Nuggets, but ultimately if you want that upfront decision to have a meaningful impact you are still going to have to jump on a major party. The third party options don't have a lot of traction. And many of them take on ridiculous opinion just stay relevant. What we have is a lot of diverse ideas in a single party instead of a bunch of diverse parties.

&gt; And we've seen your movies and TV programs. We've seen the endless GIFs on Reddit with servicemen returning home, the pictures of incredibly expensive weapons of destruction with thousands of upvotes every time and anyone saying, ""But that is billions of dollars we could have used to invest in something useful"" is downvoted into oblivion.

On Reddit? No. That's the easiest way to get upvotes other than having a cat with a heart shape birthmark on it's nose.

I'm all for investing that into infrastructure, medicinal industry, medical industry/research, etc. That's not an un-American thing to say. However, politicians look at jobs, tech, GDP. I think right now, most Americans would be happier with less spending. 

I call BS to this issue. I mean short of T_d, I don't know where that comment would be downvoted.

&gt; America simply loves war. 

Simply disagree. America loves content. And the middle class is content. As long as they are, the rest is easily obtainable by the oligarchy that actually runs the show.

&gt; You're willing to allow your infrastructure to crumble, to pay through the nose for healthcare and get third world outcomes for that, to allow your entire middle class to be eroded, and all of this to pay for endless wars, wars in tiny, technologically-backward places you couldn't identify on a map, wars in countries that mostly never offered you the slightest harm at all, and particularly, failed wars that did not achieve their stated military, geopolitical, or economic goals to the slightest extent.

Wars aren't our biggest expense. Sadly to say. That's probably why it's so easy to add to. 

&gt; to pay through the nose for healthcare 

We don't actually pay through the nose. That's our problem here. Our problem is the lack of single payer. So we pay a tremendous amount less in Taxes, but make pretty much every other social welfare the issue of the citizen. Which isn't fair to the poor or the needy. That's our issue. I know reddit likes to show how much we pay in medical expenses and everyone shows their EU bill. But that's not big picture. The average US citizen's Medical + Taxes is still a lot fucking less than UK Taxes alone. Our problem is that we seem to think this is an entitlement as if it was a bad word.

I think we are getting to the point where the expense will get so bad, the US population will start to really understand Single Payer. This isn't health care cost. The cost is the cost. The issue is the payer. We fuck over the lower classes, and I couldn't tell you why we like to. 

&gt; If you don't like this picture, then do something about it. Don't complain to people on the Internet that it's unfair that you're tarnished with the ""war cult"" brush when it's absolutely fucking true - get angry, and use that anger to get busy.

Yes because we aren't also the country of protest. Thank you for the lecture.

No one complained that it's unfair, the statement above was that the US was **FOUNDED** on Bronze Age War Cults. That's just simply not true. Historically that's completely wrong. Mainly because our founders were mostly agnostic or atheist. I mean our second president was sworn in our a book of laws because he felt the bible was non-sense. So calling a bunch of founders who idealized the enlightenment movement bronze age is just incorrect. Period.

The first age of endless war was really brought on by the war of 1812. This where the US realized it wasn't going to be independent and a country with a militia army was rubbish. But if you want to attack our current defense spending, the real historical event was WWII, but really it was that extreme spending pulled us out of a depression and then apparently is a really good GDP tool, which is nice for a country of farms.

You can call us ""War Based"" or ""Conflict Hogs"". We agree. Actually a lot of us would like to be isolationist and let the world fuck off.

Small beers are thought to have been a drink of choice among Medieval Europeans and North American colonists alike. Commonly referred to as ""porridge-like"" in consistency, small beers were often unfiltered, and widely recognized for being hydrating and, to an extent, nourishing (with the added benefit of being more sanitary than water). In this way, small beer came to enjoy quite the following. Even George Washington was a fan...

The idea that people drank beer to hydrate is not just some apologist bullshit but rooted in history.

CaravanOfDeath,,Cronus’ No.10 fan 🐿,"After thrashing out the terms of its divorce with the European Union last year, Britain's has its attention set on the future. For the new year, diplomats are moving onto a new phase in the Brexit talks. 

European leaders could not ignore Britain's ongoing departure when they welcomed in 2018. They sought to echo the insouciance projected by Jean-Claude Juncker last September when he told the denizens of Brussels that their project ""must advance"" without Britain [""because Brexit is not everything"".](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-17-3165_en.htm) Their aim is to show they are not cut up about Brexit by busily pushing on with further integration.

Emmanuel Macron called on his ""fellow European citizens"" to ""reinvigorate European ambitions"", insisting that ""France can't succeed without a strong Europe."" Meanwhile Angela Merkel [declared](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/31/world/europe/germany-angela-merkel-new-year.html) that ""no matter what, Germany’s future is bound"" to that of the EU and called on ""the 27 nations in Europe"" to ""more than ever...stick together"".

As easy as it may be to interpret such talk as a snub to the ""deep and special partnership"" the British Government seeks with the bloc after Brexit, there is something deeper to note: they aren't in any doubt that Britain is leaving.

Monsieur Macron liked to tease the British in his early days as president, breezily declaring last year that there was [""always a chance to reopen the door""](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/09/29/eu-leaders-really-think-britain-could-ever-rejoin-do-treat-us/) if Britain wanted to back down on leaving. He later fleshed out a vision for Europe in which he said he could not [""imagine that Britain could not find its place.""](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/09/26/emmanuel-macron-says-britain-will-have-place-inreformed-simplified/) 

But now he kicks off this year by railing against ""giving way on anything"" to ""nationalists"" or ""skeptics"". That is not the tone of a leader who expects Britain to walk back through the door, if it remains open at all.

European leaders are getting on with the tricky task of adapting to life without one of their club's biggest net contributors, with the Commission starting to try and get [more money out of the remaining members in order to fulfill its budgetary ambitions.](https://www.ft.com/content/7c11ba4c-e565-11e7-8b99-0191e45377ec) Officials know how much money they stand to get from the British, but now they have to work out who else will plug the gap.

(This process will be far from simple incidentally. One of the [biggest net beneficiaries of EU funds is Poland,](https://financialobserver.eu/recent-news/poland-is-net-eur163m-beneficiary-with-eu-in-feb/) a nation that has become somewhat of a pariah state in the eyes of Brussels' bureaucrats amid the [current Article 7 row.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/12/18/eu-infighting-poland-poses-threat-theresa-mays-brexit-talks/) Can they resist the allure of [punishing the Polish financially](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-poland/poland-expects-uk-will-get-swiss-like-deal-with-eu-after-exit-idUKKBN15G5CH) for 'infringing EU values'?)

So even the EU accepts Britain is leaving. If only some Remainers would take notice, like the born again pro-EU [renegade Lord Adonis,](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/12/29/lord-adonis-resigns-theresa-mays-infrastructure-tsar-row-brexit/) as they carry on their quixotic campaign to stop Brexit. The Labour peer, who [ostentatiously went to see Monsieur Barnier in October alongside Ken Clarke and Nick Clegg,](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/30/rebels-say-clegg-clarke-adonis-meeting-eus-chief-brexit-negotiator/) told the Guardian that he thought the civil service was on his side, saying:

""I do not know a single senior civil servant who thinks that Brexit is the right policy, and those that are responsible for negotiating it are in a desperate and constant argument with the government over the need to minimise the damage done by the prime minister’s hard Brexit stance.""

If mandarins are really fighting against Theresa May's Brexit strategy as desperately as Lord Adonis makes out, they should reflect on why they're doing so. The British public has barely wavered in his support for Brexit, [as YouGov has found.](https://whatukthinks.org/eu/questions/in-highsight-do-you-think-britain-was-right-or-wrong-to-vote-to-leave-the-eu/) Remainers hoping to ride a popular backlash to stop it are set for disappointment.

A New Year is a time for resolutions, and European leaders have made their own one clear: to not let Brexit stop their project. They aren't trying to mount a last ditch plea to Britain, they are getting on with life. They may have had doubts at first, but the last few months have shown them that it's something they'll have to live with. 

Some Remainers have accepted that Britain is on its way out and are constructively engaging in the debate about what its future outside the EU should entail. As the talks move on, Remainers like Lord Adonis risk getting stuck fighting about the past.

whenthethingscollide,,,"Um...with regards to the first point, you do know that minorities, at least black minorities, didn't all collectively decide that they wanted to live together segregated from everyone else. It was white people who decided that. I suggest you look into discriminatory housing practices such as redlining that were used to make it such that black people would have a difficult time being able to even find places to live among white people. It's naive to blame ""self segregation"" while ignoring the larger forces at play for decades, keeping black people separate against their will. Minorities usually tend to live with each other in part because the majority group doesn't actually want them integrated, and in part because they need to be around those who are willing to lend support and help when needed. *sometimes, minorities are forced to ""self segregate"" regardless of whether or not they want to due to racism*

On to the rent point and places of living part, I'll again point to red lining once again just to dismiss the notion that wealth, not race, plays a role here. And I'll provide a few more sources to point out that race still does play a significant role on ones ability to find a place they want to live in and can afford.

These wealthy black people have discussed how they still face racial discrimination despite their money. Such as people not selling them property despite their financial ability to purchase it. 

With regards to the history classes, I'll point out that there were recently lawmakers in Arizona who tried to ban ethnic studies classes. Perhaps it's a bit too presumptuous to assume that different ethnicities will always be taught. There will at least be people trying to change that. And as far as I know, there aren't lawmakers trying to erase ""white ""history or European heritages from the academic record.

About the invisible knapsack, I think of it this way. 

When renting an apartment, let's say you get a place. If a hypothetical landlord decided to keep black applicants from living there and only accept white applicants, would a white applicant who was accepted recognize that they benefitted? Nope, not unless the landlord admitted to being racist. But they did benefit from the reduced competition. 

Are white kids significantly harmed by not having ethnic studies courses? No, because their heritages will likely still be taught about. 

If a white kid faces a judge that tends to show a bit more leniency towards white youth and gets a slap on the risk fine for their weed possession when they would've received a harder sentence had they been black, would they actually know? Nope. 

It's simple really. 

If competition and opportunity for one or more races is reduced, the other races benefit from the increased available resources. More apartments since some places won't rent to blacks. More jobs since some employers won't hire blacks. More cops pulling over minorities means less cops to pull over everyone else. But they wouldn't know it. The benefit is the knapsack, and the fact that it's easy to overlook is why it's invisible 

White privilege isn't really ""white people have it easier"" but rather ""white people have benefits directly related to being white (as opposed to rich or healthy) that they may not be cognizant of due to the very nature of those benefits"" which would mean that you can still have a tough life, tougher than non whites despite those benefits. But it doesn't change the fact that the benefits of whiteness are still in existence in greater society. And the evidence supports this, but you'd have to be exposed to it to know about it.

You seem to think it's just me. It's not just me, it's many people, both in NZ and Australia and in Europe and in America, who think that it was a terrorist attack. 

I've actually read the court ruling, and the judge who prosecuted the French agents has some really interesting things to say:

Of course there was intimidation: it was meant to prevent other Greenpeace attempts at protesting the nuclear testing.

kulio_forever,,,"&gt;And China has embarked on history’s most expensive foreign infrastructure plan. Under the Belt and Road Initiative, it is building bridges, railways, and ports in Asia, Africa, and beyond. If the initiative’s cost reaches a trillion dollars, as predicted, it will be more than seven times that of the Marshall Plan, which the U.S. launched in 1947, spending a hundred and thirty billion, in today’s dollars, on rebuilding postwar Europe.

See this is a faulty comparison, it seems to me.

These projects are getting priced at ""market rates"", I assume, and in many ways the prices are determined by China. I mean, China is offering construction services and financing for these projects, just sign on the dotted line and how many hookers should we send to the hotel tonight?

Those terms and the terms fixed by the US (I suspect they were also loans assumed by the European nations but not sure) are probably pretty different.

In addition, we have already seen China take control of the projects themselves, after the debtor nations find they can't pay. There quite possibly will be many more of these. 

That doesn't look much the same at all to me, unless you can show me all the projects paid for though the Marshall Plan that ended up owned by the US government after default.

Finally, these projects are (it seems to me) more selective as far as breadth of development. Ports. Toll roads. I think the Marshall Plan was probably broader in the development projects.

Trexrunner,imf image symbol,IMF,"&gt;In the rich and middle-income countries that make up the OECD, the median wage of a woman working full-time is 85% that of a man. This is not, as many assume, because employers pay a woman less than they would have paid a man in her place. Data from 25 countries collected by Korn Ferry, a consultancy, show that women earn 98% as much as men who do the same job for the same employer. The real reason is twofold. Women outnumber men in positions with lower salaries and little chance of promotion. And men and women are segregated between occupations and industries; those where women predominate pay less.

&gt;Just a fifth of senior executives in G7 countries are female. Across the European Union supervisors are more likely to be male, even when most of their underlings are female. Nearly 70% of working women in the EU are in occupations where at least 60% of workers are female. The top four jobs done by American women—teacher, nurse, secretary and health aide—are all at least 80% female.

&gt;Occupations dominated by women have lower status and pay. Primary teachers in the OECD earn 81% of the average for graduate jobs. Nurses earn less than police officers; cleaners less than caretakers.

Name calling isn't productive. The issue is as much a cultural one as a structural/legal one.

Some aren't as intelligent as whites. Others are smarter. Blacks, on average, have a much lower IQ than whites. East Asians and Ashkenazi Jews, on the other hand, have a higher IQ on average. Make of it what you will, this is an objective fact.

There is really no way to measure talent. However, white Europeans have been responsible for most of the scientific, cultural, technological and philosophical accomplishments of humanity. This is a fact.

Doi. Nu ma gandeam la genul de ""pentru viitorul copilasilor"" in sensul de a-i creste cu lingura de aur in gura. Dar ca sanse sa se dezvolte si sa duca o viata normala, un copil are mult mai multe sanse aproape oriunde inafara Romaniei (mai ales in Canada?). In plus, situatia de genul ""uite cate am facut eu pentru tine si tu asa ma rasplatesti!"" se intampla oricum, chiar si in familiile sarace. Important nu e sa il creasca ei pe copil, ci sa ii ofere sanse mult mai bune decat ar avea aici (nu doar acum, ci si pe viitor, cand va deveni adult; in Romania daca ar vrea o viata mai buna, tot ce poate face e sa plece altundeva oricum - ar fi mult mai bine sa fie crescut de mic altundeva).

Cred si eu ca fericirea parintilor e un punct important, dar daca tot nu sunt in stare sa ajunga la o intelegere din cauza fericirii, atunci ar fi mai bine sa se gandeasca la copii. Copii sunt numitorul comun, si daca nu se gandesc la ei, atunci nu prea le dau sanse sa ramana impreuna si sa fie si amandoi fericiti in acelasi timp, ceea ce ar puta duce la dezbinare, pt. care tot copii vor ajunge sa plateasca pana la urma. Asa ca, eu unul cred ca ar face bine sa ia serios in calcul si viitorul copiilor de pe acum, decat sa ajunga toti cu reprosuri si probleme de familie mai tarziu.

Throwaway1223245,,,"Hey,

I suggest that you cash out in EUR, if you currently have £ instead of BTC on GDAX, play the market, reinvest it, then sell on the EUR market.

Once you've sold on the BTC/EUR market and you have your ~€5600 there, here's what you do:

- Open a Revolut account if you haven't done so already, active your EU account. and transfer your Euros from GDAX into there with a SEPA transfer. This is free. 

- From Revolut, you can exchange your € to £ at the interbank rate, with no commission. 

From Revolut, place your £ into your UK bank and pay your debts. 

Some things to note:

- Daily limit of ~€11k transfers out of GDAX if you're on the simplest verification.

- Monthly (free) Limit of £/€5000 transfers on Revolut

I would suggest you split this over two months to be safe. All of the above will be completely free. The only variables are:

- Play the markets to get the most € from your bitcoin on GDAX
- Watch the exchange rate on Revolut between £/€ to get most bang for your buck.

You won't need to declare this to HMRC, unless this  5k figure pushes you over the the 11.3k CGT allowance you get this financial year. If it does, take out the maximum you can this year while staying under 11.3k, then the rest in April for the 18/19 FY.

A) Jeg tror du grelt har misforstået hvad ""åbne grænser"" betyder.

B) Hvordan ændre det på noget, selv hvis det kun var arbejdere? Det er jo netop arbejderne jeg skriver om, da arbejderklassen udgør størstedelen af befolkningen i størstedelen af verden.

Tager 100.000 tilfældige EU-arbejdere (fra en hvilken som helst kombination af EU-lande) og 100.000 tilfældige afrikanske arbejdere, så vil EU-arbejderne være bedre uddannet, sundere, have en langt højere IQ, deres kultur vil flugte med vores og vi ville kunne kommunikere på enten engelsk, tysk eller spansk med dem.

vornash2,,1∆,"&gt; conned

There's a reason why some people call it the ""dark arts"" of persuasion, the people with buyers remorse, but academically it's just known as Persuasion, without any negative or biased connotations.

But there's your problem, this is how politics works sir.  Both parties lie, all politicians lie, we all know it, sometimes they're not major lies, sometimes they are.  Now this has been business as usual for so many decades, perhaps since our founding to some degree,  we just accept hyper partisanship as a way of life in America, when there are plenty of countries in Europe and elsewhere like Japan and South Korea with no political division even close to what we have.  

The biggest issue in Japan I know of is Japan should abandon decades of passivism militarily to counter China's growing power.  But I guarantee you Japanese people know most of our issues, while we know very few of theirs, sometimes due to ignorance yes, but also simply because their so homogeneous.

And please before you bring up the Nazi transformation of Germany, almost everyone who saw that transformation with their own eyes is dead now.  My grandma is 97 now, my last surviving grandparent.  Her husband, my grandfather went to war against the Nazis as a tank commander in Patton's 3rd army.  That generation is gone, sometimes called the greatest generation, certainly among areas of right-wing thinking.  My point in mentioning this is to understate the importance of remembering history in context of today.

The US had overt propaganda during WW2, same as the Nazis, however in some ways they were conned by the politics of the era, but the people loved it and they loved their Government.  But it's not really being conned, it's simply being lead in a particular direction under a particular philosophy, under the influence of socialization.  Dropping a nuke on Japan?  OK SKIPPER!  Flag saluting patriots in spirit.  But that's the last time our society looked in a orderly fashion, not with all this division and hatred at the highest levels of society as well as the lowest.  Yes racism still existed, but this in many ways was a golden era in American history that is now in slight decline, and even slight is an important psychological issue in politics, especially for the right.  

In fact, if you're smart, I would argue you may be more vulnerable to this phenomena of hyper partisanship.  But once you understand that facts don't matter, it's relieving to know that people are not crazy, they're just not rational, that's why we have so-called ""elites"" to guide us (or con us in a particular philosophy).


&gt; ""talking past the sale.""; and getting things intentionally wrong. Neither of these things are actually considered good persuasive techniques.

If you could provide some evidence from a book that's highly regarded on the same issues of Persuasion, I may be convinced otherwise, but based on what I know of what Scott has wrote about, I just don't think that's likely.

&gt;Try and look at Trump without trying to admire him or criticize him. Take a long and dispassionate look at not only the things he says, but at the way he behaves. His actions aren't those of a person trying to persuade anyone of anything, but rather to desperately cling to an already existing base.

That is literally the job of every politician.  People have not even fully explored or recognized the full reasons why Trump won, and they are complex as fuck, I know that, but I guarantee you, any  discerning political observe better also consider what people think about the economy (good) and the gap between where that is and where historical Presidential politicians have hovered on average.  People like myself, who may have voted for him, but don't fully appreciate his attitude 100% either.  Within that group, Trump has all the persuasion room in the world, those are his folks, the voted once, and they are not that are to sell later if economic conditions are near optimally expected, because it's always about expectations, psychology, voter sentiment is a beast that cannot be easily analyzed.

And the implications, going forward as people become numb to all this and it becomes more like something we simply have to tolerate for 4 years, that negative sentiment may dissipate.  We've gone from Trump is Hitler, to Trump is a stooge of Russia, to a reminder that Trump is accused of sexual misconduct that never goes to trial, to he's just incompetent now and didn't get anything done, and now we're at well he got some things done, but we don't like them (in a year).

&gt; We find that that once the occupational breakdown is incorporated into a regional analysis of immigration, the immigrant-native ratio has a statistically significant, small, negative impact on the average occupational wage rates of the regions. 

It found that the occupational groups that saw the most substantial cut in their incomes were the very poorest, such as care home workers. 

This finding comports with the most fundamental laws of supply, demand and price. It also aligns with the 2012 findings of the government's Migration Advisory Committee, which [found] (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/257235/analysis-of-the-impacts.pdf) that:

&gt; A ballpark estimate is that an extra 100 non-EU working-age migrants are initially associated with 23 fewer native people employed. Such evidence suggests that successive governments
since 2008 have been right to make non-EU migration more selective.

It also reflects the views of the former head of the Remain campaign Stuart Rose, who said that Brexit would drive up wages, which he views as a [bad thing] (http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/stuart-rose-businessman-who-backed-immigration-for-cutting-wages-to-lead-campaign-to-keep-britain-in-a6688561.html).

The reason I seem ""fairly bright"" is simply because I read long, boring PDF reports, and because I get my news from The Guardian but also from the The Daily Telegraph, to avoid being brainwashed. And because I don't believe the kind of economists who work as paid ""consultants"" for large enterprises, because I know they tailor their findings to suit the agenda of whoever's paying them. 

How do I know that? Because I've worked for exactly those kinds of economics consultancies, and have multiple friends who still do.

Edit: Incidentally - your linked-to example of a ""decent economist"" is a man who works for a university that takes economics so un-seriously it doesn't even offer it as a full degree.

EtiamPharetra,,,"Questa è un'ottima domanda.

Per non essere incostituzionale una tale presunzione dovrebbe cadere l'uguaglianza formale e sostanziale dei cittadini, con l'introduzione di una discriminazione per lo status di ""ladro"", nonchè dovrebbe cadere il principio della colpevolezza, reintroducendo una forma di responsabilità oggettiva (presente nel codice del '30 ma disintegrata dalle numerose pronunce della consulta), e in base a tale responsabilità oggettiva verso chi si mette contro l'ordinamento (dovrebbe cadere anche il principio di determinatezza della fattispecie penale) si dovrebbe automaticamente presumere in maniera ASSOLUTA la adeguata proporzionalità di qualsiasi reazione, nonchè la necessarietà; in pratica dovrebbe cadere il principio di legalità quasi in toto.

Tali principi enunciati sono stati riconosciuti come ""controlimiti"" dell'ordinamento costituzionale italiano (vedi sentenza taricchio e risposta della consulta, su un corollario del principio di legalità); cosa vuol dire controlimiti?   Vuol dire principi inderogabili, inalienabili, ma soprattutto immodificabili.

Questo vuol dire che non è possibile derogare o modificare tali principi, che fungono da limiti impliciti alla revisione costituzionale neanche con la procedura aggrava e l'iter dell'art 138 della costituzione, perchè superiori anche alle fonti di rango costituzionale.

La risposta alla tua domanda è pertanto la seguente: L'unico evento che potrebbe modificare così profondamente l'ordinamento Italiano per renderlo compatibile con la depenalizzazione del fatto da te descritto è una rivoluzione violenta che causi la fine dell'ordinamento attuale e lo sostituisca con un altro, privo dei suddetti controlimiti, che ammetta discriminazioni, responsabilità oggettiva e analogia interpretativa, nonchè eventualmente tribunali speciali a seconda dello status dei cittadini coinvolti.

Tali controlimiti sono una particolarità dell'o.g. italiano che rendono la nostra costituzione probabilmente la più rigida esistente.

Se prendiamo un paese come la Germania, seppur con uscita dall'eu, dalle convenzioni (vedi Cedu in primis), e una modifica della costituzione, sarebbe possibile conformare l'ordinamento senza doverlo sostituire in pieno.

Sinceramente non sono a conoscenza di paese civilizzati dove sia applicata la piena depenalizzazione, ma sicuramente alcuni paesi permettono una dilatazione dell'immediatezza della reazione (anticipandola e/o posticipandola) più diverse presunzioni di proporzionalità che possono avvicinarsi (ma non incarnare appieno) la tua visione.",True,0,1514934052,,1514934249,0,ds3nx13,False,t3_7nh7ze,t1_ds3cw11,/r/italy/comments/7nh7ze/accesso_facile_alle_armi_cosa_ne_pensi/ds3nx13/,1517503033,1,False,italy,t5_2qkhk,public,

They immensely helped bring Moon Jae-in to power.

Japan 

Gen Z/Youth among Japan are not only politically disengaged but disproportionately more supportive of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and Abe's military expansion than older voters

Poland

The youngest voters supported Paweł Kukiz - it results from exit poll research conducted by the Ipsos center for TVP. Among Poles, up to 29 years old, Kukiz gained 41.1 percent support

As the survey also proves, young women offer less support to radical parties and have less radical and more centrist views than men. Still, both Kukiz and Korwin-Mikke win among them anyway. 35% of young men would choose Kukiz, and 20% women. Much less, but still the most. More shocking is that despite the above mentioned sexist views declared by Korwin-Mikke, 14% of young women (as opposed to 25% young men) would give him their vote.

Conducted by the Institute of Public Affairs and pollster Kantar Public, the survey found Polish youths are significantly more likely to describe themselves as right wing than left wing. According to the data, 68 per cent of 15-24-year-olds described their political views as conservative while 30 per cent said they were on the left.

Kukiz’15 enjoys the strongest support among young voters according to the study, with 27 per cent of those surveyed saying they would vote for the right wing, anti-establishment party.

China

China's youth are the least nationalistic and jingoistic generation in China ever. University students are at a low for communist party support, most identify as Capitalist-liberal

Beijing youth in particular are seen as overtly optimistic and pacifist. 

They're also the most religous demographic there by a lot

They still put zero value in western interpretations of freedom and liberty but most want to copy America's electoral system more than Europe's. 

They also prefer America and Americans to Europeans and Russians, 100% opposite of any group pre 90s/mid 80s.

Hungary

An Hungarian survey by some Hungarian think-tank discovered almost 40% of Hungarian youth have no plans to stay in the country - The highest migration potential characterizes students who refer to themselves as liberal, left-wing and specifically, with pro-European inclinations,
who are dissatisfied with the current system, and who perceived a democratic deficit even in the very potentials of replacing the government or the freedom to
criticize it. With 63% of these demographics expressing zero-interest in staying in Hungary 

Among Hungarian youth 40% support The Jobbik, LMP-Green's 20%, Orban's cult also gets 20%

Jobbik’s voter base is mainly defined by male students in undergraduate programs whose parents had no college/university education and are religious on their own
terms. To a larger extent, LMP voters tend to be female, non-religious, from highly qualified urban families, pursuing MA or PHD degrees. The most characteristic traits of Fidesz-voting students include being religious, feeling more secure concerning the future; many attend undivided university programs (i.e. Law School and Medical School). Left-leaning students are less religious; more often have highly educated
parents, and are mostly female with origins in major cities. 

On the other hand, support for Jobbik
and LMP grew significantly: the latter was able to garner protest votes especially in major cities and the capital, whereas the former managed to pull off this feat almost everywhere else

Indonesia

Indonesia. Y

Almost 60 per cent admitted to having ""radical"" religious attitudes. Asked if they were intolerant of minorities, more than half said yes, with mainstream Muslims not only drawing lines between themselves and non-Muslims, but also against other Muslim minority communities such as the Shi'ite and Ahmadiyah.

Almost a third had no problems with intolerant acts committed by others against minorities, while almost 90 per cent said the government should ban heretical groups.

The other survey by polling firm Alvara involved more than 4,200 Muslim students, mostly from top schools and universities in Java, the island where half of Indonesia's population live and work. It found that nearly one in four students, to varying degrees, was ready to fight to establish an Islamic caliphate

65 per cent of respondents were uncomfortable with Chinese Indonesians ever having any government position

Jakarta-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), reveals a strong lean towards xenophobia, with 47.8% of millennial respondents believing that foreign companies have a negative impact on Indonesia’s economy.

Enlightenedbri,m2,Mystel,"Game is indeed pve oriented. Pvp is kinda limited to a daily battleground on a rotating event, and the weekly Civil Unrest guild vs guild. 

End game pve is basically farming 5 people dungeons. There are 8 dungeons, some have 2 levels of difficulty. The dungeons are divided in 3 groups based on difficulty. I’ll give you the names in case you want to check some youtube video or something. 

The low tier are braindead: Ravenous Gorge, Kalivan’s Challenge, and Shattered Fleet. 

Mid tier are Lilith’s Keep, Kalivan’s Dreadnaught (slightly harder than Kalivan’s Challenge), and Thaumetal Refinery. 

Hard tier are: RK-9 Kennel, Sky Cruisier, Lilith’s Keep Hard, Thaumetal Refinery Hard, and Broken Prison. 

Then there is the highest tier with RK-9 Hard, and RK-9 Extreme were the last boss is much harder. Event dungeons also go here. 

There’s also a 20 people raid for hardcores, Harrowhold. 4 phases. Weekly reset. Big ass dragon. 

We get some new dungeons and old dungeons coming back every 4-6 months or so. 

In between patches we often get 1 additional dungeon focused on boss mechanics, like Manglemire or Demon’s Wheel. This time that would be Broken Prison making a comeback with some new mechanics. 

Sometimes there are also event dungeons which are extremely hard and require good gear. Like Sky Cuisier Exteme mode. Europe now has Dreadspire Upper Floors Extreme mode, a revamp of Dreadspire, even harder.

You need to read up on it. Di Stefano was owned by two sides, Barca negotiated with River Plate, Real with Millonarios. Barca refused to pay Millionarios and that caused a stalemate. Real tried to sign him, it all became a very public battle, and the regime had to step in due to the embarrassment it was causing them. Their attempts to mediate were clearly designed to not favour either side. First they banned all foreign players, essentially saying neither of you can have him, but then when that proved unworkable, made the suggestion for each of them to have him for a year, after which Barca pulled out. It comes down to them not understanding football more than anything.

The Spanish federation also warned Real off the signing of Kubala, as he was considered a defector by Hungary, but Barcelona were able to nip in and get him.

The West coast would probably ban together and immediately enter the Top 10 World Economies.

New York State's GDP alone is greater than that of Australia and is close to that of Russia's or Canada's. 

I really don't see Canada doing much since their population is focused around the seaboards which would have an easier time going their own routes instead of joining Canada.

The East coast would probably still have a large amount of diplomatic ties especially if the NYSE is still running due to the implications of starting trouble. Not to mention the East Cost is closer to the European powers and Canada's capital.

shallowm,,أمير المتوحدين,"
The elimination of the ""white"" race is inevitable. In fact, race is, for the most part, a nonsense construct, but the ""white"" race even moreso. It is clear that there is no explicit, accurate definition for being ""white"", the phantasm of ""race purity"" is far from reality and is grounded in nothing but the fantasies of people who think that those that they do not consider ""white"" are ""taking muh womenz"" (read: insecurity, as well as misogyny).

In present-day society, the identity of Western countries and their inhabitants are not pegged down by race, but by nationality—additionally, you can now see people mixing their origins with their current nationality, an example being so called ""hyphenated Americans"". These people range from someone holding some aspects of their culture dear to them, to someone who calls themselves so because ""my [insert near ancestor] was from [insert foreign country]"". Contrary to the European failure at integrating immigrants, the United States has done well with the integration of immigrants, and miscegenation of races will thus be unavoidable, and the delusion of ""white purity"" will become extinct.

Even in Europe, although they may not have succeeded in integrating their immigrants well (leading to the formation of ghettos such as the ones in Tower Hamlets, London), there will always be a few immigrants who manage to escape from the grasps of these ghettos and integrate within larger society. This leads to race-mixing as well, albeit to a lesser extent, but every bit counts, and every bit helps. Why? When two people of color have children, you can usually see distinct features from both parents present in the child. When a person of color and a white person have a child, the most commonly (and usually only) feature passed down from the white parent is lighter skin (cumskin). This is due to the fact that the genes that lead to the expression of so-called ""white"" phenotypes, are for the most part, recessive. This facilitates the elimination of ""white"" features in society.

Furthermore, children who have blood from both a person of color and a white person are forsaken by those who fantasize about the white race being preserved, even though they carry recessive genes from their white parent, genes that could eventually be expressed again. This will also contribute to the demise of the so-called ""white race"".

Eventually, no person who considers themselves ""white"" will have so-called ""pure"" genes. Hence, the white race will have been eliminated by the standards set by the race purists themselves, having led themselves to their own demise.

bvndwidth,flag1,,"**Review #13**

*Elijah Craig Barrel Proof Batch 12*

The above picture is not mine, I almost always take one, but I suppose I forgot.

This was a 2 oz sample from a swap with /u/brenttw. Rested neat in a glencairn for 10 minutes

**Distillery**:  Elijah Craig is a Heaven Hill product made from their 75% corn, 13% rye, 12% malted barley mashbill. This is batch #12, the last of the old bottle design. 

**Age**:  12 Years

**Color**: 1.5 [Auburn](http://malt-review.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Colour-bar-Big.jpg)

**Proof**: 136

**Nose**:  Dense rose petals, ethanol, dark red cherries, butterscotch candy, funky &amp; distinctly smokey.

**Taste**: Incredibly hot, but at 136 proof I would be surprised if it didn’t have some heat to it. Dark red cherries, heavy smoked oak flavors, this tastes like a bourbon finished in JW Black Label casks (I’m pretty sure that’s not how scotch works, but you get the idea).

**Mouthfeel**: Medium-thin, warm cheek tingle, followed by a full-on assault of flavor and heat.

**Legs**:  Another high proof bourbon, another halo, another lack of legs.

**Finish**:  Spicy red cherries, more smoked oak, followed by artificial green apple jolly ranchers.
 
**Final Thoughts:** Wow, this is a pretty interesting whiskey, it’s definitely the Elijah Craig profile I know and love, but with a heavy cherry flavor that overshadows the regular sweetness I was expecting. This is regular EC’s fire-red-dyed-hair European cousin who speaks with a thick accent. The finish is long, and intense. In my opinion too hot, I ended up splashing in some water to tame it, and it ended up tasting like a sherry finished bourbon. If this wasn’t so unenjoyably hot, it’d be a point higher on my scale  

*Ratings do not factor in cost*

**Rating: 6**

Arbitrary Scale

1. Slightly more potable than paint thinner
2. The ""Steel Reserve"" of whiskey 
3. Gifts for people who you don't like
4. Mix with various sodas
5. Decent, dynamic, good for most things. The type 
of whiskey that would call its mother more. 
6. ""How much of this am I allowed to drink?""
7. ""Daily Sipper"" territory
8. ""Don't pour more than one glass asshole, I'm 
trying to save that bottle""
9. Shit you pull out to impress people who actually 
drink whiskey A.K.A. The I-drink-whiskey, whiskey.

Germania (Latin: [ɡɛrˈmaː.ni.a]; modern English ) was the Roman term for the geographical region in north-central Europe inhabited mainly by Germanic peoples.

It extended from the Danube in the south to the Baltic Sea, and from the Rhine in the west to the Vistula. The Roman portions formed two provinces of the Empire, Germania Inferior to the north (present-day Netherlands, Belgium, and western Germany), and Germania Superior to the south (Switzerland, southwestern Germany, and eastern France).

Germania was inhabited mostly by Germanic tribes, but also Celts, Balts, Scythians and later on Early Slavs.

They planned to create a ethnic state without considering the indigenous voice. 48 was just the culmination of the project to create a state in land they dont have any legitimate claim. Zionist was the invaders and the threat to the peace. The 48 split plan was just taking Arab land without asking the majority of population opinion and create a new country that zionist planned for decades. 

Arab had thousand reason to be against this plan and to try prevent it. Just look history of the region...(from ottoman domination to the creation of Israël through european colonization)

I agree with you that there's no scientific evidence showing any negative health outcomes from GMO's, yet. It's a contentious issue and half of the EU feels the same way as Russia. And considering that most GMO's are made to tolerate various herbicides, poisons, and fertilizers, maybe some people just aren't into putting that shit into their bodies. I know I'm not.

So... banning GMO's is progressive *in my opinion*. I prefer my food the natural way, and so do many other people apparently.

Kalanan,,,"&gt; I'm not sure I follow your logic. Are you arguing that a procedure that reduces risk by 60% shouldn't be done because it's not 100%? Or that circumcision should be done to more men, instead of on a subset as it is now? Or are you arguing it is not effective, despite mass circumcision being a recent phenomenon?

You are thinking that what happen in Africa will give you 60 % less HIV infected people in the US. Or at least some impact. Except it does not, despite having 60 % of the male population circumcised. The us still have around 0.4 % prevalence like the EU where circumcision is rare.
By the way circumcision and the pandemics of HIV are roughly at the same time for the US, I would say it even predates it by one or two decades.

Edit : I was about right, by 1950 50% of the population was circumcised while the epidemics is widely known to have started in the seventies.

&gt; The failure of HIV prevention? What?

the failure to see the context of the US as the AAP seems to have done.

&gt; I just talked about the tension between bodily autonomy and medical necessity.

Circumcision cannot be considered a medical necessity in the US. Not by a sane person knowing the stats. The prevalence is only 0.4 %, and especially among gays.

&gt; We have medical ethics boards. I reject the notion circumcision is too hot potato for them.

Ethics boards don't legislate. To enable a bill to ban male mutilation is a very complicated process right now, with an important chance of alienating religious voter.

Turkey is a strategic target for Russia, warm water ports far better than the terrible one in Syria and the Bosphorus is vital to Russia’s interests. If Turkey were to move towards Russia then Turkish politics would be taken over by Russian shills - look at Ukraine. It’s in the better economic interest for turkey to work with Europe?

Russia isn’t looking for a Turkish partner, it’s looking for a puppet with nice geography that can be useful to hurt the west. What happens will happen to the interests and lives of the Turkish people. Turks think they’re hurting the US by moving toward Russia but I can tell you not a single person in the US feels turkeys alliance today and none will feel turkey leaving tomorrow, but everyone in turkey will feel it the second they move into Russia’s sphere. 

NATO protects turkey from Russia and the Arabs, NATO keeps turkey western as much as possible and allows Turks to do business with Western Europe (a huge source of GDP). Is it possible to exists as good as today or better without NATO? Yes, but it’s much much more difficult...and I don’t believe turkey is currently capable of pulling this off. Instead turkey will become a Russian punching bag (like Ukraine, Georgia, Syria, Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, and all of Central Asia). 

Of course the super wealthy will do fine in every case and the ultra poor will suffer just the same as before too, but the rest of turkey will feel a lot of hurt leaving NATO and the West.

ExplodedWeevil3,,[sNs],"Hello Brok,

I hope you would consider joining Soldiers Never Sleep (sNs). We are an international clan founded in the U.K. back in 2011. We have members in nearly every timezone with about atleast 40 active players on daily and another 100 players on at varying times. Therefore, you will not be left out as a result of sheer size. We have members on just about all times of the day, EU or NA. We'd be happy to have you as a member, so you can get to know the guys.

Although I know you are looking for a server, I would recommend finding a group *first* and then find a server. Based on your preferences for a server, that shouldn't be hard to find at all... Anyways, we do host private events on private servers weekly or bi-weekly. Therefore, if that's what you mean, you won't be without at sNs either. Let me know what you think!

Please check us out at snsclan.com. You can also join us on Discord, a messaging app, to meet some members and hook up with players for games. We discuss things there throughout the day in addition to organizing events. You may also apply, if you'd like, at snsclan.com. This application just gives us your information to match you with players closest to you thereby reducing latency for you.

Thank you for your time. I hope to speak to you soon!

What, you think one of the most appreciated actors in star wars saying bad things about it openly is going to go unnoticed when it's just releasing?

BackTo1975,,,"Palpatine was already focused entirely on blasting Luke there and it seems like a lot of Force energy was being used. It's also unknown how strong Palpatine even was at that point, because he sure seems hobbled. I think there's references in old EU canon to him being drained, to be very old and not as strong as he could have been at that part of his life. He was definitely doing something with those dark side acolytes hanging around him, too, and when you tie in the quest for immortality referred to later by the PT, it's not difficult to see how this scene played out. Also, Vader was powerful, even wounded like that, and had huge physical strength with the Force and the suit. I never thought it seemed unbelievable that he took out Palpatine there.

And there were limits to the humour in the OT and even the PT. TLJ tossed that all out the window and threw in the terribly cheesy jokes in moments that should have been played straight. Like the Luke stuff about Rey feeling the Force when he was ticking her hand with that feather. The guy's supposed to be suicidal, down on everything, but he's still doing bits? Same with the Yoda speech where Yoda chides him for not actually reading the Jedi texts because they aren't page-turners.

Come on. We're talking about a guy who's basically come to the conclusion that his entire life has been a failure and enters the movie about to complete the last ritual to end the Jedi (pretty clear he's at least strongly considering to off himself when Rey arrives). But he's still yukking it up?

The tone was way off in too many moments in TLJ. Nothing was off limits to a bit or a corny line. The OT just didn't do this. Otherwise we'd have had Luke making jokes when he met with Vader and the Emperor. Leia making a crack to Tarkin before he blew up Alderaan. And so on. It was too meta, too forced, and way too much of a wink to the audience to not take all this stuff too seriously.

J.A. Henckels has a really wide range of quality - where are the knives made? It should say on the blade near the bolster. Their cheaper ones are made in Thailand and China, while their more expensive ones are made in Germany. Middle of the road ones might be made in Spain.  
  
Depending on where they are made, the European made ones are solid knives. They might not be as good as a knife from a lesser known Japanese maker with better steel, but they are definitely good enough for almost any home cook.  
  
In order to keep them sharp, I would highly suggest either investing in a set of Japanese wetstones or paying to have them professionally sharpened. The King brand stones on Amazon are of decent quality for the price - you'll probably want a 1000 grit and a 3000+ grit one as well. If the knife gets chipped or really dull, you might want something like a 220 grit, but as long as you're careful with the knives, 1000 grit is usually a good starting point.  
  
I would highly NOT recommend a pull through sharpener such as [this one.](https://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/wusthof-ikon-manual-knife-sharpener/?catalogId=50&amp;sku=6193564&amp;cm_ven=PLA&amp;cm_cat=Google&amp;cm_pla=Cutlery%20%3E%20Knife%20Sharpeners%20%3E%20Manual&amp;kwid=productads-adid^225632026782-device^c-plaid^368476279136-sku^6193564-adType^PLA&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA-KzSBRAnEiwAkmQ15w-h6yWa98r7wTDPbmfKQpX6p7no6iHyKMD50mtRzkgulFXjCml1XBoCy3oQAvD_BwE&amp;cm_ite=[[PLA]%20-%20NB%20Desk/Tab])  
  
There are plenty of local sharpening services in most places costing anywhere from $5-10 per knife.  
  
Honing with a honing steel is different than sharpening, and does not replace it. There are many discussions around the merits of honing - I personally hone some of my knives, but this does more for keeping the blade straight, rather than sharp.

The_Black_Daoist,NT,INTP,"&gt; Obviously False




Europe didn't solidify itself as an entity until the end of the Reconquista really. Prior to that it was a bunch of vassal states to the manifold of monarchs and clergy whom of which held very little relation to one another. It took the breaking away of Christendom (with the likes of Martin Luther, Henry VIII, John Calvin, etc.) to really create a proto-European national solidarity, but even so, there is very little identification with the term European until the age of Exploration. 





&gt; Have a look at ancient Greek sculptures / art. They are clearly white Europeans.





I would like to start out with pointing to the fact that an abundance of Greek art has been altered. [See this article in Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/drsarahbond/2017/04/27/whitewashing-ancient-statues-whiteness-racism-and-color-in-the-ancient-world/#712b897675ad) and further reading, this article from [Smithsonian](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/true-colors-17888/) . But even that being said, there are a lot of places which shows Greek [art](http://realhistoryww.com/world_history/ancient/Minoan_Greece_2.htm) in which there are various ""races"" of peoples. I would also recommend the book *Black Athena* by Martin Bernal. In it Bernal does a very good job on explaining how European scholars of the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, through the racialized theories being thrown around academia, worked very diligently on erasing as much evidence of Black and Arab peoples inhabiting (and being) Greek as possible. You have to remember, Greece, having an immense amount of trade with Africans and Arabs, also must have had some Egyptian colonies or Arab colonies, let alone intermarriage. So, they are clearly not ""white Europeans"". They are, once again, Asiatics. As a matter of fact, Europe only claims Greeks as Europeans when they are speaking on ancient Hellens. Greeks even today are looked at by Western Europeans as non-European. There is a lot of anti-Greek sentiment. (Part of the reason the EU, and especially France and Germany, have manufactured an economic cesspool with Greece in which they are now able to create a pure neo-liberalist market, that is, laissez-faire financialization par excellence.) It would do well to look up on the rise of European fascism in the late 19th and early 20th century, where this whole idea of who is European and who is not became a pseudo-science. Spoiler alert: the Greeks were not. The one time Greece was considered worthy of ""white"" status was when they were trying to obtain independence from the Turks in 1821-32. But it lasted only until the French and the British decided to back the Egyptians (whom the Turks had intervene) and the Turks over the Greeks. They won their independence, but were still considered less than dogs: you know, Irish status, except without the ""whiteness"".",True,0,1514953738,,1514954392,0,ds44r8t,False,t3_7ncva6,t1_ds3tcdf,/r/INTP/comments/7ncva6/ethnonationalism_and_race_realism/ds44r8t/,1517512216,4,False,INTP,t5_2qhvl,public,
RainyParades,,,"&gt;I can't think of any reasonable, sane person who would prefer a sculpture of a humanoid figure melting into a puddle with a sad face over - as kitschy as it may seem - a national hero being carried by an angel or in an inspiringly stern pose.

I don't understand why someone would want only the positive beautiful aspects of life depicted in art, instead of the fullness of human experience.

&gt;Why do you think the Soviet Union resorted to romanticist and traditionalist themes and aesthetics during and after the War? Stalin realized that 2deep4u edgy chaotic crap makes the average guy want to kill himself at the end of the day.

You are comparing state mandated, state funded art for the purpose of propaganda, to an art movement that grew organically from the needs of artists wishing to express how they felt about the times they lived. I can tell you that if I saw a statue of even my most revered public figure in a heroic/inspiring pose, I would view with the greatest cynicism. 

The craftsmanship of the armor cannot be denied. And it's beauty as an example of the craftsman's ability is obvious. It's beauty as an aesthetical object I would contest.  I find it gaudy, without restraint, and vacuous. And I would prefer any amount of Zulu bead-work and baskets to that armor, just for the fact that it's honest decoration of utilitarian items. A true depiction of a peoples wish to make beautiful the things that surround them and are used by them on a daily basis. As opposed some ruler's attempt at creating an image for himself, and an attempt to show by literally wearing wealth on his warriors garb his prowess and importance and his domination. One is peoples need to decorate and make beautiful the world around them. The other is a suit of Hubris.

&gt;You can not expect that level of refinement and craftsmanship outside of Europe, the Middle East, and perhaps China and Japan. ""Coincidentally"", the peoples of these lands have high average cognitive ability. It's plain as day.

So before it was Western society, and now it's Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. So you have basically left out Latin America, Polynesia, and Africa.

watsupbitchez,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt; Yeah and who gets to use the bases in Germany

Bases that are only relevant in the context of EE. There is nothing that happens in Germany that can't be done elsewhere-especially freed of that obligation. 

&gt;ho was the only one who called for mutual defense and got Europeans killed for wars they started

That was an abuse of Article 5. There is no question. Though acting as if most of you did more than show up is a little disingenuous. 

&gt; who has their companies make full use of the privileges in Europe?

Idk what this even means. The U.S. isn't China; European and other companies can invest and divest here as they please, with minor exceptions that wouldn't include anyone in Europe outside of Russia.

&gt;Also the U.S is one of China's biggest clients, so this insinuation of ""enabling"" them is hypocritical.

We have been acting foolishly with respect to them for too long. The hope was that their ascension into the WTO would encourage them to open up their markets, at minimum. That plan failed. China is tightening its grip on its markets, not reducing it, and using the increased access that it received as a WTO member to put every other member at a disadvantage.

A new approach is needed. 

&gt;what you forget is that the US has now threatened Mexico, Canada, most of South America, Europe, China, Australia, India, Pakistan and part of the Middle East

And what all of them except the high-and-mighty Europeans realize is that Trump will be gone in a few years. NAFTA remains the single largest trade bloc in the world. Australia, as much as they dislike Trump, realizes the threat that China poses to its own economy and political system. India is probably the only country not named Israel with better relations under Trump than Obama-not because of Trump, but again because of China.

There are no excuses for Trump, but he has been a useful litmus for revealing the deep antipathy among many of our so-called transatlantic allies for us. 

&gt;Honestly, I think you lot have more to lose than us with a change in Status Quo.

That's because the knee-jerk hate on your side of the pond is blinding you to the fact the status quo has worked better for Europe (particularly the West) than is has for just about anyone else. American policy has been to keep the eurozone stable and strengthen it as a military partner; the world will look very different when you have a U.S. and Russia both incentivized to sow chaos in the region. 

I think that a U.S. unburdened by propping up a hostile and ungrateful WE by doing its job for it in EE has many more options once this is no longer happening. But that does not change the fact that coordinate efforts to combat China's mercantiist policies are best for everyone.

&gt;Also as a final, is there a point in any co-operation when the US and Russia are already plotting together?

Fucking European hypocrisy and condescension at its finest.

You bunch were *literally* building warships for the Russians before Ukraine, and had to be browbeaten and shamed into not delivering them, even after MH 17 was shot down. 

The former German PM is *literally* the chairman of *Rosneft*. 

You are *literally* pushing a new pipeline that will bring more Russian gas to your markets in a manner that bypasses your so-called partners in EE. 

This is not hyperbole; it is not wild conjecture. These things are facts. And then you have the nerve to claim that *we* are somehow conspiring with Russia?

The idea that it's us collaborating with Russia is a prime example of how blind emotion clouds the judgment of so many of you.

AgileSnail,top_contributer,Top Contributor,"Spoken like a true googan. You must either be muslim or want to see the collapse of Western Europe if you actually spend effort to defend their vicious cultural tendencies. 

&gt; What's the reproductive rate of immigrants for first, second, and third generation?

Doesn’t even matter, millions of economic migrant “refugees” are coming in legally every year and millions more are literally [storming the fucking Mediterranean shores](http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/10/europe/migrant-boat-lands-on-spanish-beach/index.html) of Europe. If every one of them has 8 children (current average for refugee women in England) they’ll outnumber native Europeans after 1 generation or 2 at the most. That’s not long enough for the whole “access to technology and education” part of the equation to factor in. Instead of assimilating and becoming successful, they’ll breed so fast that they’ll turn France, England, and Germany into Afghanistan replicas. 

Pretty soon you’ll be seeing gay people legally murdered under sharia law in the streets of Paris, all the dogs in London killed, and entire generations of women in Berlin who can never orgasm. 

&gt; So a 1/3 of Muslims live in typically impoverished...

I’ll disregard this whole part of your comment since you’re talking about Muslims globally, I’m very specifically talking about the refugees in Western Europe who have a much higher average birthrate solely due to the fact that they’re specifically entering these countries to outbreed the native populations of those allowing them in. 

&gt; Shame that Christianity is losing its monopoly on genital mutilation in the US.

How about no genital mutilation? That said FGM is horrendously worse than circumcision. A dick still functions fine with no foreskin, a vagina with no clitoris does not. Not to mention they typically do it to girls at a much older age than boys typically get circumcised. 


It’s a crisis mainly due to how many came in over this short of a time. If they came like regular immigrants, 10-20k a year, Europe would probably be fine. They’d for the most part be forced to assimilate into our culture and like you said after a few generations you wouldn’t even know. That doesn’t happen when 700,000 enter England in one year, they form their own communities and don’t feel the need to converse with those unlike them. Combine that with their population rates and you have a recipe for disaster.

WikiTextBot,,,"**Prostitution in Europe**

The legality of prostitution in Europe varies by country.

Some countries outlaw the act of engaging in sexual activity in exchange for money, while others allow prostitution itself, but not most forms of procuring (such as operating brothels, facilitating the prostitution of another, deriving financial gain from the prostitution of another, soliciting/loitering).

In eight European countries (The Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Greece, Turkey, Hungary, and Latvia), prostitution is legal and regulated.

The degree of enforcement of the anti-prostitution laws vary by country, by region and by city.

**Time for IT firms to take responsibility for the cities they ruined** 

 ______ 
As the tech boom has stalled and new hiring has slowed to a crawl, many of the
real estate developers are left holding the bag with a large inventory of
unsold homes and unleased office space, all hastily built up in a naïve
anticipation of never ending growth. Photo: Bloomberg

When social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter first set off and
were getting established, their goal was to improve how human beings connected
with one another and to foster an alternative platform that could be used to
strengthen human bonds and relationships. It’s clear today that they have
grown and morphed into something a lot more sinister. Twitter has become a
tool to sow division. No one understands the power of Twitter more than
President Donald Trump, who continues to use the medium as a way to rally his
strongest supporters and to alienate those with opposing views. Many feel that
Facebook played a large role in the 2016 US presidential election and it has
been accused of helping to foment genocidal violence, in Myanmar for instance.
Uber’s business practices have been questioned. Bitcoin is being viewed with
suspicion, and sometimes even called a “fraud” by people like Jamie Dimon.

American sociopolitical debate, and Europe’s heavy fines on firms such as
Google have made it clear that Silicon Valley’s CEOs are no longer just start-
up founders and software product builders. They have become society’s leaders
and oligarchs in their own right and have the ability shape our opinions and
our political leanings. And yes, they can also contribute in various ways in
shaping the political milieu by influencing which politicians we vote into
office. This influence is in no way contained to America and Europe, savvy
politicians the world over, including here in India, have learnt how to
harness the power of these platforms for their own political purposes and
agendas.

Western commentary has started to focus on how such innovators need to
consider the massive sociopolitical ramifications of their inventions, and how
they must act responsibly in the light of the immense power they now hold.
Susan Wu, a veteran American investor and tech evangelist neatly circumscribes
current thinking there in an op-ed piece for _Wired_ magazine: “The tech
industry can either design for and build positive externalities, or we can
inflict many negative ones—job displacement, fracturing of neighbourhoods,
addictive behaviours, compounding isolation, fortifying tribalism, and
widening income inequality, to name a few.”

My view is that such navel-gazing and contemplation among America’s technology
elite is welcome, and that it might actually allow for these firms to start
thinking of the broader ramifications of their work, and allow them, over the
longer term, to work in concert with each other to maximize the common good.
Tech leaders have been responding, partly through publicly genuflecting to
such commentary and partly by trying to respond with action, such as vetting
posts for violence and “fake news”.

Unfortunately for us in India, none of our information technology (IT)
services titans seem to be thinking in this manner. During the early days of
the industry when India’s governments wanted to give a fillip to employment,
many of these firms enjoyed long tax-holidays through various schemes such as
the Software Technology Parks of India or STPI, where one could simply build
one’s own campus anywhere, comply with a scant set of rules to declare the
campus as an STPI, and proceed to enjoy tax benefits denied to the rest of
Indian industry. When pressed on whether these tax benefits were unfair, the
usual response of these tech titans was that these benefits were certainly not
unfair, since the people they employed were now contributing to India’s
exchequer through income tax and other taxes levied on tech employees. To me,
this was a rather disingenuous view; let’s not forget that the employees of
firms who were not in the tech sector were also paying their taxes, while
their non-tech employers were also contributing to the exchequer by coughing
up taxes at a company level.

India’s tech-boom has laid waste to our cities. As real estate developers
sought to cash in on the unprecedented migration into our cities caused by
technology workers employed at India’s top IT companies, and by Western
companies such as Accenture, Cisco, and IBM, our once salubrious (though not
necessarily well-planned) cities have been reduced to concrete jungles with
inadequate roads, falling water tables, questionable sewerage and drainage
systems, and choking pollution. A study from the Indian Institute of Science
says that Bengaluru might become unlivable by 2020. The thought boggles the
mind, but just a day spent getting to and from a tech company’s offices in
Bengaluru underscores how true that study may really turn out to be.

As the tech boom has stalled and new hiring has slowed to a crawl, many of the
real estate developers are left holding the bag with a large inventory of
unsold homes and unleased office space, all hastily built up in a naïve
anticipation of never ending growth. Some of our cities now look like the
banks of a polluted river that has receded after a flood. Debris are strewn
everywhere, in the form of lost jobs, dashed hopes, and increasing crime.

During our conversations over coffee or dinner, we like to place the blame for
our crumbling cities squarely on India’s governments at the city, state, and
national levels. While ruing India’s lack of infrastructure probably has some
merit, placing the blame for our crumbling cities solely on the government is
unfair. Just as the Americans have called their tech titans (all of them firms
who are not government owned) to the carpet to answer for the changing social
construct in America, we should be naming and shaming our tech titans by
holding them accountable for what has happened to our cities while they
enjoyed their tax holidays.

While a small minority of the founders of these firms have publicly announced
their intention to contribute to charity, very many have not. And even for the
ones who are not Scrooges, as the old saw goes, charity begins at home. It is
time they contributed directly to the cities that house them and whose ruin
they have indirectly caused.

subaltern-class,2-hands,Marxist,"What a load of liberal garbage. If we listen to Bookchin, apparently we learn that Marxism is wrong because class struggle isn't actually real or relevant.

&gt;Thus the most crucial task for a revolutionary movement today is to win over to its views the great majority of the population. 

Utopianism revived yet again.

&gt; The great uprisings of the revolutionary era that we have examined in The Third Revolution tried to make just such appeals, albeit in different ways. The leaders of the English, American, and French revolutions--the democratic revolutions, which defined their goals in terms of changes in governmental institutions--believed themselves to be acting on behalf of a broad social base: white male owners of small amounts of property. Social theorists like the eighteenth-century Encyclopedists addressed their writings to this population as “the people,” advocating the restoration of freedoms usurped by the nobility.

Bookchin harkens back to a time before capitalism fully developed - when classes were able to unite around their opposition to feudalism - and uses that as his model for a present-day ""revolutionary"" movement. He's promoting a regression back to bourgeois populism and demagogy (since class struggle isn't real anyhow!)

&gt;To Marxist historians, however, these democratic revolutions were “bourgeois,” since the “inalienable natural rights” they touted for the people as a whole were really meant to be enjoyed by only a fraction of the population: the bourgeoisie.

They were bourgeois revolutions because they empowered the mercantilists and middle-class liberals against the landowning aristocracy, and created institutional forms that were conducive to the development of capitalism. Not because of the ideology of its participants.

&gt;Nothing testifies to the isolation of revolutionary Marxism more decisively than the fact that between 1914 and 1939 not a single Socialist or Communist party ever achieved even an electoral majority in any major European country. 

Fucking lmao. ""Communism is the real movement to win parliamentary representation"" - Carl Marks, probably

&gt;Their program will have to be a civilized statement in every sense of the word: humanistic, ecological, and moral as well as economic. They will need to carefully sort out the complexities of different forms of governmental institutions and find ways to use them to approximate an expansively free society and count not simply on a blow of the sword but on step-by-step advances.

More garbage utopianism and social democracy which Marx thoroughly debunked 140+ years ago.

&gt;In fact, the proletariat as a whole has generally feared insurrections--and has acted in an insurrectionary manner only under the most exceptional circumstances. 

Thanks for clearing that up. (""We are also aware that revolutions are not made deliberately and arbitrarily but that everywhere and at all times they are the necessary consequence of circumstances which are not in any way whatever dependent either on the will or on the leadership of individual parties or of whole classes."" - *Engels, Draft of a Communist Confession of Faith, 1847*)

&gt;The past half-century has shown that the old Marxist economic imperatives are no longer tenable. No “general crisis” has emerged since the 1930s

Published two years before the worst world financial crisis since the 1930s.

&gt;Ecological breakdown does not confront a single class alone. Rather, as it involves a market mechanism that inheres in society itself, it menaces all classes of society. In short, revolution may no longer be a class-limited concept; it affects humanity as a whole. The “constituency” of ecological breakdown consists of the vast majority of the population. Ecological breakdown can be avoided only by abolishing the competitive market system and fostering the fecundity of the natural world.

In the 20th century the bourgeoise came close to destroying large portions of the human population with nuclear war, so it's unlikely that large-scale destruction of the human species will be a mitigating factor for capitalism anytime soon. The bourgeoisie will simply move to more climate change resistant parts of the world as the it becomes more uninhabitable, leaving the poorest sections of the proletariat to die by the millions. This is the future that Bookchin wants, since revolution is too scary for him.

You're a whore for power and you haven't the faintest idea of how the real world works. Compare similar nations or similar situations in a country's history and you can find a lot. But you're unwilling to look at production and productivity for the US and how CEO pay is drastically higher in the US compared to similar European economies.

&gt;Wow, are there only politically-tinged posts on this subreddit now?

Well, here, we have a problem, two. For some reasons, ambassadors from other countries have shown their ”concerns” over Romania regarding corruption, over the legislative aspect, which they [haven't specified of what they're concerned of to begin with](https://floricaroman.wordpress.com/2017/12/29/solicitare-celor-7-ambasadori-europeni-sa-precizeze-care-articole-din-modificarile-la-legile-justitiei-ii-ingrijoreaza/).  

Here, the madam is part of those ambassadors with her superficial concerns about the country. However, as I hope you've seen the photos, she has no problem dining with people that have *actual* broken the law, not just political mumbo-jumbo &amp; witch-hunting. Though, it speaks for itself, she'd rather dine with these people than high officials of the government or parliament. 

Speaks volume... quite a lot.

And the Netherlands is one of the countries that blocks Romania from entering the Schengen Area. It has to do with the feud between Amsterdam and Constanta port (though, it's a long history).

DWRDone,participant,,"For check-in bags, I like samsonite cosmolite or Rimowa salsa line. My family and I only use hard-sided suitcases with 4 wheels, as /u/amelisha touched on. It just makes it easier to lugg around, pack shoes into, to do the shameful ""repack"" at the airport.. I remember having to get my suitcase 1 kg less heavy but knowing I had a heavy pair of boots...at the bottom of my suitcase. With a soft-sided suitcase that didn't split in 2. 

For carry-on:

**Budget**: Away travel's standard carry on is really good. I dont even use the battery it comes with because it adds unecessary weight and I have never needed it. It scratches and catches onto dirt really easily tho. It's compartments are helpful. My best friend loves her muji carry-on suitcase and says its comparable to Away, minus the battery. It even has a function to lock the wheels which is useful if you take public tansport and don't want your suitcase to roll to the other side of the train carriage. 


**splurge**: Rimowa Topas. Its my favorite one but I don't use it when I'm flying budget or restricted weight limit on carry-on. Its a lot heavier than all my other options but the style of it can't be beat. 



If you're buying a set, I'd go with samsonite cosmolite as they look the best all together. I haven't ever had a problem with any of our suitcases and their warranty is good, if you do need to replace wheels or zippers. Added benefits of there being a samsonite store/reseller in most places which can't be said for the newer niche suitcases like Away. I wouldn't buy the carry-on tote because I doubt you'll end up using it. I rarely see people using them in addition to a carry-on bag, esp if you plan on flying intercontinental in europe where you're usually allowed 1 carry on + 1 personal item.

CorbynMasterRace,,British Isles - Never Wrong - Russian Bot ✅,"Europe’s biggest markets regulatory shake-up for a decade suffered a setback after UK and Germany granted last-minute reprieves to the continent’s biggest futures exchanges to implement the rules.

Underlining the complexity of the Mifid II reforms that touch on everything from the cost of analysts’ research to the trading of equities, London’s Liffe derivatives exchange and the London Metals Exchange were given an extra 30 months to comply with rules on the very day they come into force.

The UK’s Financial Services Authority said in a statement on Wednesday that it had granted the extension to ensure the “orderly function” of a clearing market that the reforms are designed to open up. BaFin, Germany’s national regulator, granted a similar request from Deutsche Börse, the owner of Eurex, the Frankfurt-based futures exchange, late on Tuesday.

The proposed changes to the clearing industry are part of the sprawling Mifid II legislation that has been almost a decade in the works and is designed to offer more protection for investors and force more competition in the financial markets in Europe. The FCA only assumed the powers to grant a delay today.

Brokers have said the changes may depress trading volumes in January as a set of reforms that touch on everything from the cost of analysts’ research to the trading of equities take effect.

Banks and brokers have been scrambling to upgrade their IT systems in advance of Mifid II, which will require far more detailed reporting of trades. Mifid II is expected to cost the finance industry more than €2.5bn to implement, with the largest banks spending more than €40m each on compliance, according to estimates by Opimas, the consultancy.

In securing its late delay, Eurex argued that the exit of the UK — Europe’s largest market for clearing derivatives — from the EU introduced too much uncertainty, given that Britain may not be bound by the rules once it leaves.

The proposed changes would also potentially increase the links between clearing houses at a time when the shape of the UK’s future relationship with the EU is unclear.

Many City institutions had lobbied for the changes, especially the London Stock Exchange Group, which owns the LCH clearing house.

“Brexit is a game changer,” Eurex said following BaFin’s decision. “We share industry concerns around financial stability regarding the open access provisions of Mifid II.”

Eurex will only have to apply the rules from July 3, 2020.

The delay from BaFin came just hours before Mifid II takes effect and as the financial services industry scrambled to ensure that IT systems were ready.

Waivers in Mifid II allow national regulators to apply a one-off delay in certain areas. France’s Autorité des Marchés Financiers has also been weighing a similar delay on clearing, according to two people who have been involved in the discussions.

However, I think a metric of FDI, positive trade negotiations, GNP, GDP, decline in unemployment all tending in the right direction, while he is working at  the golf course is a positive sign of money well spent.

Optix334,,,"&gt;Enforce immigration laws more strictly. This solution is anti-immigration

This is a fallacy. Enforcing immigration law is absolutely not anti-immigration. By saying this you are saying that every country on Earth is anti-immigration. That is very obviously not true whatsoever.

Think of it this way: You have a party with a modest entry fee. You say everybody on Earth is invited. Someone walks into your party with pockets full of illegal drugs and illegal weapons in their hands. This person has a history of using these things on and with people with reckless abandon, leading to death. 

Do you still let that person into your party? No, of course not. Don't pretend like you have a different answer. Nobody would let a known murderous thug into their party. 

Now another person walks in. This person isn't a criminal, but is known for draining anything they can off of people. They are known to spend the party eating and drinking everything, so much that there isn't enough for everybody. This person is a real turn off for people, and kills the mood. They try to take whatever they can home with them from your party. They also don't provide anything when they arrive. They are a generally unsavory person. 

Do you let this person in to your party? Maybe you do. Maybe you don't care that someone is around killing your party for everybody else, so they won't ever come to another one. The majority of people wouldn't let this person in the door.

Does denying these people mean you are anti-people-going-to-your-party? No, of course it doesn't. I means you have common sense and know that bad, risky, or draining elements do not make a party fun. They kill the party, get people in trouble, steal your stuff, and make it so nobody ever comes back. 

The same applies to immigration law, and every country exercises these rules. The party is the country, the fee is the immigration process, and the door is the border. Nobody wants criminals in their country. Nobody wants lazy people with no intent on contributing to society. 

Does this mean some good people get denied? Yes, of course there will be some. That is the case for anything with any kind of control measure for anything. There is always overlap.

However, pretending that enforcing immigration law is anti-immigration is disingenuous, and flat out incorrect.

&gt;and hopefully I've managed to explain why.

Honestly, you haven't. You've explained how your view on the issue is skewed, and that you think there are only 2 sides to the coin (Anti Immigration, or Open Borders), when you can see this isn't true in the real world. 

Look at Germany. Germany has one of the most open refugee policies right now. They viewed it as a way to solve their growing skilled labor issue. Look what has happened. Spikes in all kinds of heinous crime, a damaged economy, overpopulation (people were literally living in container cities), massive unemployment, and draining of social resources. All of this, *and they still denied some people at the border*. The strain on the country is so bad that [Germany itself cannot even solve the problem anymore. They are being pressured to ask the EU for help](https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-refugees-should-look-to-europe-to-solve-problem-says-weber/). 

Immigration control is absolutely necessary for any country. You can be pro-immigration (like the vast majority of people are), support enforcing immigration rules, and anti-illegal immigration at the same time. These aren't mutually exclusive concepts.

SelfLoveDotGov,,,"&gt;Do you think Alt Right movements in various countries will lead people on the left to compromise with more right wing positions and people?

""Alt Right"" refers to explicitly nationalist, racist politics in the US. The US had its right-wing proper disappear because of World War II. In the 1950s and '60s, however, the American conservative movement redefined ""left"" and ""right"". Buckley, et al imagined themselves as heading into battle against communists but, in practice, became enemies of milquetoast Keynesian liberals. So they shifted ""left"" and ""right"" to recast their actual debate in the more world historic terms Buckley, et al wanted to fight in.

The ""Alt-Right"" exists in the US because of this. In the US, conservatives classify themselves as rightists. In Europe this is a position more typically occupied by nationalist and cryptofascist parties.

TL;DR: the American conservative movement called itself ""right-wing"" despite not being so, making ""alt-right"" a term for what is simply normal right-wing politics elsewhere.

&gt;Do you feel the Alt Right has influenced the politics of Generation Z, and if so in what way?

No, not really. All the stuff about Generation Z seems driven by marketing analytics companies generating free advertising.

&gt;What do you believe they'll do in the future?

Renew America's rejection of what are mainstream rightist politics elsewhere. Unlike Europe, the US doesn't have a central nationalist mythology like France, Germany, Italy, or wherever else. It was built in the pre-nationalist era and never went through a period of uniting an ethnolinquistic group or casting out colonial oppressors (the American Revolution is probably better described as another English Civil War). So there isn't much for them to grab onto and, if you notice, they don't have clear ideas about what an American ethnicity is.

NixonB91,s1 3 team-3 country-eng,Liverpool,"The strange thing about Scholes is that he was never that highly rated during his peak. The other day I stumbled across an old Match of the Day Annual from 2006, which included a list of the best midfielders in the world at the time. Lampard was 1st, Gerrard was 3rd and Scholes was 13th, below Torsten Frings and Shunsuke Nakamura. Now I know that random lists like that don’t really mean anything in the grand scheme of things, and Scholes was definitely a lot better than both Frings and Nakamura. However, it does indicate that, back then, Scholes wasn’t rated particularly highly by the general footballing public.
  
Scholes started to gain popularity from about 2009 onwards, when Barca were dominating Europe with their tiki taka and we starting getting quotes from the likes of Xavi and Iniesta, praising Scholes and his style of play. And I agree with them, Scholes was a rare example of an English player with brilliant technique, who was underrated over the course of his career due to playing in England, where people tend to value physicality over technique. However, I’d still say that it’s a bit of an overreaction to consider him as one of the best midfielders of all time, when for most of his career he wasn’t even considered as the best midfielder on his team (Roy Keane was brilliant).",True,0,1514971816,,False,0,ds4e8wk,False,t3_7nt4dw,t3_7nt4dw,/r/soccer/comments/7nt4dw/how_good_was_paul_scholes_compared_to_other_great/ds4e8wk/,1517517435,21,False,soccer,t5_2qi58,public,

&gt; BERLIN - Angela Merkel of Germany, addressing her country as an acting chancellor, pledged in her annual New Year&amp;#039;s address on Sunday to work for all Germans and to swiftly form a new government to help ensure success into 2018 and beyond.

&gt; In a sobering assessment of the divisions in German society that led to a fragmented result in the Sept. 24 election, Ms. Merkel acknowledged that despite the country&amp;#039;s economic strength, many Germans feel left behind.

&gt; The party, known by its German initials, AfD, won about 5.8 million votes, 12.6 percent of the total, including one million who had previously voted for Ms. Merkel&amp;#039;s party.

MicrodoseLSD,,MicrodoseLSD.com,"Thank you for the positive review ! Those nice words mean a lot for us !

It will be nice to address some of the concerns though:

* Regarding the design - We did not aim at good looks but it came naturally as we put a lot of effort to develop the 1P-LSD Microdosing Solution and this bottle truly does the job of protecting the 1P-LSD Molecule for a very long time. It is both classy looking and does the protection task which is the main priority. The nice design is a result of real effort and thinking put into the Solution and not a marketing ploy. Our team has been doing research with the solution long before it was intended for sale.

* The ""mg"" vs ""µg"" on the site : This is a bug and does not allow µg to be shown, we are working on solving the problem with a new code. The description of the products though clearly states micrograms ""µg"". /u/lysergicquestions

* Regarding the price tag - even though 500 micrograms cost 50$, for those who normally use express tracked shipping , the final price when the shipping is included is the same or LOWER compared to other vendors. Especially to the US. The most famous and cheapest vendor currently charges between 50EUR and 60EUR for international shipping. We charge 30EUR for Europe and 35EUR to the US which is 25-30EUR less !  We will be lowering the shipping costs even more in the future to make the product even more affordable and eventually lower the price of the Solution as well.

We will be answering any questions that might arise in this post.

Mai mult decat atat, odata ce i-ai oferit puterea absoluta, ce il impiedica sa isi aroge toate prerogativele ei, sa dea foc la contract, iar daca tie nu iti place sa te bage in inchisoare?

2- Ceea ce propui tu este, in mod minimal, modul cum ar trebui sa functioneze democratia electiva multi-partidica. Un partid propune niste masuri in campanie, castiga alegerile, iar apoi daca nu le respecta, exista posibilitatea alegerilor anticipate, sau peste 4 ani nu mai e votat.

the_commissaire,,,"&gt; How is this not Brexit in name only?

Because we will be out of the CU, meaning we can strike our own trade deals and meaning that the European Courts have no jurisdiction over matters which do not directly involve trade with themselves.

Because we will also be out of the SM, which means that the UK will be able to end freedom of movement. 

We will also be out of the EU, we will be no longer be paying into the EU project for anything other than the things we use. We will neither pay into or take our CAP, CFP or RDF.

Is it ideal, probably not, is it better than we have now, it is my opinion that it very much is.

&gt; At the end of the day neither of us really know what will happen but was is clear is that the potential problems have essentially been kicked down the line,

Well I agree that we don't really know what will happen, that much is true. As for kicking the can, there is only so far we can kick it. First up is 2019 when we make the first step into the transitional period. The second is the the end of the transitional period in 2021. After that, that's it; we have what we have, we don't what we don't. We can of course change what we have, but that will obviously take time and we'll be paying for the ramifications in the meantime.

&gt; simply being very well prepared for Brexit

The problem here is that the onus was on David Cameron, Remainer in cheif, to ensure that there was a viable solution if we voted to leave. He was so sure that remain would win that he didn't bother.

&gt; impact assessments

Impact assessments to carry any merit should have happened before the referendum to inform. Except that they would rightfully be viewed with suspicious as the author of such reports, including the government, would obviously introduce their own bias. Impact assessments after the ref' are as good as useless, we've voted to leave, the content of any of the reports isn't going to change that.

deaconblues99,,,"When we look at the most ancient populations of humans across the planet, we're basically left with some of the peoples from sub-Saharan Africa, and peoples from Australia, who may be descended from one of the earliest groups of humans to colonize the world.

Because we originated in Africa, and because indigenous Australians also have dark skin, we can probably safely assume that the last ""common ancestor"" of all modern humans probably also had dark skin. It's an effective adaptation for dealing with high UV levels, which are present in the tropics where humans evolved.

Other features that the last common ancestor of modern humans are less able to be easily sorted out, and may come as something of a surprise. There are many features that are probably very ancient that are shared by many modern populations. And some that might seem likely, but may not have been present, in those early human populations.

Epicanthic eye folds, for example, are found in many modern populations, including peoples living in Africa, Asia, the Americas, Indonesia, and various Pacific Islander populations. European populations typically do not have them. Therefore, we might be able to conclude that the *presence* of an epicanthic eye fold is actually the ancestral condition.

Similarly, the kinky hair found among African populations is *not* shared widely outside of Africa. Indigenous Australians don't have that type of hair texture, and neither do most Asian populations. Thus, so-called ""African"" hair may actually be a local adaptation that occurred *after* some modern human populations left the African continent.

Your question is difficult to answer because it's been at least 70,000 years since anatomically modern humans migrated out of Africa, and perhaps longer.

Pat75014,,,"My bet is all secretes of this new Tesla MegaChargers socket have yet not been revealed. From my own maths on the night of the truck and the Roadster2 announcements, I bet this plug was a modular plug made of 4 x pairs of 320kW to 400kW making a total aggregate of 1280kW to 1600kW combined for 500M Truck. Obviously it is only DC pins (no AC here at all), and these pins are much thicker than current Tesla Supercharger modified Type 2 used in Europe, to allow to pass greater current without too much burden with liquid cooling of the cables...etc. My other bet is each pair is at least 800 Volts times up to 400 Amps, or even they could be 1000Volts times 320A up to 400Amps, or even 1200Volts times 267 up to 333 Amps, for even easier colling. Either way it will have to use more than current &lt;400 Volts used in Model S &amp; X batteries. So my bet is only future V2 versions of Models S &amp; X and may be 3, will be set with batteries re-layed for 800V up to 1200 Volts (Say 2 to 3 x more cells mounted in series), will be able to plug on one Pair out of the 4 of this MegaCharger Plug, may be 2 x pairs for the highest capacity say 200kWh models derived from Roadster2 packs when available. To charge  current Models S&amp;X&amp;3 from that plug would require to devide the Voltage by 2 or 3 on one pair, which should not be an option on same plug as Amps could not balance that hence it would take you back to current SuperCharger v2 120kW maxi, although there may be a few old &lt;400Volts Supercharger plugs added by Tesla to each new Megacharger location for convenience, separatly. 
Then you need to count the Cs to make sure battery could accept the charging power without wearing too much. My current beloved Model X 100D charges a little below 1.2C (Means 120kW maxi for 100kWh pack). Charging them at 320kW tomorrow would mean 3.2C that is quite high and could damage the battery a lot faster hence endanger Tesla beloved 8 years unlimited mileage warranty on current Mod S&amp;X batteries. While doing same with new Roadster 200kWh packs would only mean 1.6C at 320kW or 2C at 400kW per pair, hence a lot more manageable with sam 8Y warranty and a slightly improved battery cooling system. If charged over 2 x pairs the 200kWh packs would still require 3.2C at 320kW or 4C at 400kW, which again would be a wearing challenge for the batteries, .... unless Tesla got a battery Brakethrough that could double current batteries charging cycles (The secrete Tesla Canadian battery-guru electrolyte applied here ?) and used that to multiply the Cs with same cycles hence 8Y warranty as before ???

Lightning_Shade,,,"&gt; Sure, and lots of other stuff too. The 8% figure is quite high, even compared to other US reports, and figures from the UK and Australia put it under 3% in those jurisdictions. In Europe 2-4% seems typical and nowhere is it higher than 9%.

Point 1: the blog deals with the US statistics. Point 2: who calculated those other statistics? I could just as easily claim that it's advocacy companies like ""End Violence Against Women"" who might be underestimating _their_ statistics, because observer bias cuts both ways -- and since the US statistics were, mostly, compiled into studies by advocacy groups, I don't see why other countries can't have the same thing happen.

&gt; The fact that evidence shows many experts and police think it is much higher than that give cause for concern that police are inflating these numbers by being too easily convinced that a claim is false.

Even in Kanin's study (which is _awful_ for several reasons) the only thing that counted was the ""victims"" themselves saying it's false. Yes, false confessions happen, but do you believe in a false confession rate over 80%? I don't. (again, the blog talks about this better than I ever could)

&gt; The highest figures also seem to come from times and places where an awkward pregnancy was a major social problem that a woman could not deal with privately, meaning that these false claims were not attempts by eeevil women to frame men for rape, but attempts to avoid the consequences of infidelity, mixed-race relationships etc.

Absolutely true, and one of the many reasons why people using a study from that period of time _nowadays_ are simply wrong. And forgive me for sounding like a broken record, but the blog mentions it.

&gt; The overall picture is that the MRA narrative of eeevil women using their eeevil power over the legal system to get innocent men convicted of rape is not entirely mythical but is close to it. Actual men actually raping actual women outnumber these false rape accusations by probably a factor of a hundred or more. So if you want a social problem to solve maybe that should be a higher priority for you.

First of all, how do you know? In the last link I've given, there's a breakdown over what types of cases are dealt with in the studies. The same data set and methods that are used to claim 8% are false could be used in the other direction to claim that about 7.8% are true... which is, of course, bullshit, but that's because there's too much stuff in-between. Hell, the most common result for any particular report was, essentially, ""could not classify for sure"". So even _they_ don't know. How do you?

Second, using statistics to prioritize the importance of different problems can lead to nasty results. Transgender people are one of the statistically tiniest minorities in existence -- does that mean we shouldn't care about them? (And yes, the blog mentions that example.)

Overall, the correct result seems to be, according to Data Gone Odd, that there's a very small percentage conclusively proven to be false, a similarly small percentage conclusively proven to be true, and a whole lot of various stuff in-between. This ""in-between"" is what muddies things up.

Sean_O_Neagan,eu,European Union,"&gt;You keep suggesting that the EU is somehow shafting us through 'neoliberalism'. 

No, the EU does not do this to us, that's not the way power works. Our own elite relies to some extent on the apparatus of the EU to do this to us.

&gt;Increasingly this just seems to be a catch-all for ""anything I don't like"" used by both right and left-leaning commentators alike.

I don't think that's quite fair. It's quite specifically the Hayekian view of society promoted in the Reagan/Thatcher years, adopted by New Labour and most of the Davos set, rejected by Corbyn and a number of other new social movements, both progressive and reactionary. The Hayek view - that market logic is supreme and should overrule social logic - is what we're discussing here.

&gt;Any large bloc of nations will tend towards political centrism because that's the only way you can find common ground between left-leaning and right-leaning governments.

Yet when 'centrism' is to the right of centre, and the decision makers are sufficiently aloof from local accountabilities, the policy product of that kind of collaboration will be financialised, international market logic - as close to Globalism as capitalist nations are ever able to get.

&gt; However, what you seem to be conflating with neoliberalism - i.e. things like zero hours contracts and lack of pensions - I'd say is far more to do with austerity, 

Both are policy reflections of a world view that prioritises the needs of capital over those of the general public - that sincerely believes the needs of the market must come first, that any deviation from that logic = instant Venezuela. 

&gt; which is very much a Tory policy - otherwise why is it so much more prevalent in the UK than in the rest of the EU? 

It was a Thatcherite worldview, which Labour then adopted for the best part of 20 years, alongside all the European elites who no longer felt the threat of socialist alternatives once the USSR finally imploded. That Tories and New Labour realised the Hayekian dream more forcefully in the UK than German or French elites have been able to is not for want of trying on their part. But the post-war compact has proven harder for those two to budge. We'll see how Macron gets on with it.

&gt; You don't see too many zero hours contracts or lost pension rights in France. 

It's true that there has been more resistance in Germany and France to zero hours - [full fact](https://fullfact.org/law/zero-hours-contracts-uk-europe) has a useful summary of the position across the EU - but it's far from the case that the UK stands alone in its acquiescence to that elite  'innovation'.  With pensions, there is profound 'unfinished business' for the neoliberal project across Europe - Forbes has [a taster](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnmauldin/2017/10/03/the-pension-storm-is-coming-to-europe-it-may-be-the-end-of-europe-as-we-know-it/#7e9687961a5c) if you're interested.

&gt;So as to make your argument a bit more clearly, can you:
&gt;
&gt;* Define what you actually mean by neoliberalism?

Hopefully you've got my answer on that, above.

&gt;* Demonstrate how the EU is forcing this upon the UK?

Again, not my point - it's necessary to distinguish between the elites in member states and the specific political constraints within which they each operate, and their publics. This is not an international problem, it's intra-national, between classes in each country.

&gt;* Suggest how a Tory government might make the UK look different if it weren't for this neoliberal agenda being forced upon us by the EU?

I have no brief for a Tory government, I don't think they can solve anything. But a party that breaks from the neoliberal world view can, and the first step to that break is to challenge the neoliberal consensus, as Brexit has shown we can do: we've shown democracy can still buck the market, despite Thatcher's dictum.",True,0,1514983597,,False,0,ds4iyw4,False,t3_7nnen1,t1_ds4efjm,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/7nnen1/liam_fox_calls_for_end_to_obsessive_criticism_of/ds4iyw4/,1517519981,1,False,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,public,
dances_with_unicorns,UNSA,USA,"This is pretty much the usual right-wing strawman. Nobody [1] seriously argues for mass immigration from *anywhere*. Even mass immigration from a developed western country would be a massive logistics headache. Current government policy is to focus on skilled immigration (Blue Card, preferential immigration policy for students who graduate from German universities). The ""mass immigration"" canard is a piece of fiction commonly used to justify otherwise indefensible positions.

What we're dealing with (concretely) is the problem of large numbers of asylum seekers, not planned immigration. The problem is that we have two groups of asylum seekers: the ones that are entitled to asylum or subsidiary protection, because they flee persecution, a civil war, or something else listed in the Qualification Directive; and the ones that aren't entitled to either asylum or subsidiary protection (many of whom are simply desperate for other reasons, but still do not qualify).

And this is not an easy problem to solve, because you have to look at every case individually, unless you're willing (in contravention of international law) to send people to places where they are at risk of death. And it really only came to a head in 2015, because the effects of the Syrian Civil War boiled over and the countries neighboring Syria and Iraq that had so far taken in most of the refugees ran out of room, so Europe got hit by the spillover.

This was not a planned event; nobody wanted that to happen, it was more like a force of nature and the EU was ill-prepared for that situation (in part because various cans involving asylum law had been kicked down the road for so long).

To insinuate that this is somehow planned or that you're being criticized for opposing such a non-existent plan has no basis in facts; racism allegations generally arise when ""concerned cititzens"" have ""concerns"" that are oddly focused on ethnic groups rather than criteria that have an actual causal connection to problems.

Some of the very best players I play, I just know are VERY VERY good. The way they keep the puck, the way they use their right stick and pass and shoot. Elite levels of gaming.

BUT at least HALF the time the connection simply creates input lag seemingly only on my side. These elite players are already elite. But it's so obvious when I lose 75 percent of my faceoffs (even when using the counters) due to lag, I usually win at least 60 percent. I can barely use the right trigger to switch players. The skating in mud kicks in and I can't move my players to avoid poke checks. This is the worst. It makes the game completely unenjoyable because I lose games 6 to 5 due to no fault of my own other than a shitty peer to peer connection.

This doesn't happen all the time. I notice it happens more when connecting with people in Canada and Europe. When it doesn't happen I enjoy the game, win or loss because it was the other player besting my skills while I WAS ABLE TO FULLY MOVE MY PLAYERS.

Anyone who thinks an Englishman and a Frenchman talking in Brussels can impose a solution on the NI border doesn't understand the problems in Ireland of the spirit of the GFA. The actual solution is of secondary importance, the fact it was formed by the people involved is primary, if the current set up had been imposed by Westminster then it would have been rejected by many on principal.  The fact the two did try to impose a solution, and even worse was other EU leaders stating preference for one side over another (We stand with Ireland on this issue) means neither side actually understand or care about the area. The only reason I can see that intelligent people, with teams of advisors,  came to the  acceptance of the non solution they did is because they know no solution is required and are heading for a result that maintains the status quo. And if you follow that thought through to its logical conclusion then the whole of the UK will leave the EU in name only and nothing will change.

Pesto_Power,,,"&gt; I've never met a group of tabletop players that would say no to playing something new.

I'd be slightly reluctant to play some systems... I've only ever played 5e and I'm quite happy with playing it for the time being. I wouldn't mind learning Pathfinder/3.5e though to see the difference in complexity between 3.5e and 5e. Also, Shadowrun/VtM both sound interesting, and I guess there are a couple of others that interest me too. 

But... it's like learning a new language - maybe it's fun to learn one just for the hell of it, but unless I'm going to use it semi-often after I've learnt to speak it, then what's the point? I learnt French for my GCSE's, I've never spoke it since, and I've forgotten 90% of what I learned. I might consider learning German or Portuguese because I might move to Europe someday... but for now I'm happy with English.

So, I guess it's not so much the particular system (although a few systems just sound a bit dull from the outset, e.g. I don't think I'd ever jump at the chance to play 4e, and some settings just don't interest me), as that I'd only want to learn it if it was guaranteed that I'd play a lot of it in future, and that I wouldn't spend 5 hours learning it and getting all enthusiastic about it, only to play one short campaign.",True,0,1514986616,,False,0,ds4kn7g,False,t3_7nrjte,t1_ds4cead,/r/rpghorrorstories/comments/7nrjte/truth_in_advertising_is_not_a_thing/ds4kn7g/,1517520871,9,False,rpghorrorstories,t5_3fk9d,public,

Nemo_Barbarossa,NISA,Niedersachsen,"The difference is that the Gastarbeiter was asked to come here specifically to work.

I would expect that most of the refugees would want to return home. But the conflict with Daesh is but one small part of the issues that have come up down there. If I remember correctly, Daesh was only able to gain so much ground in Syria because Assad was busy fighting a lot of smaller rebel groups and militias that tried to continue the events of the Arab spring in Syria. Maybe it was the other way around, I am not 100% sure. But still, Daesh occupying where you used to live is obviously enough motivation to flee but the civil war made it nearly impossible to find shelter somewhere else within Syria in the meantime. Otherwise there would probably have been massively less spillover towards the EU in the first place.

On the other hand this means that not all is necessary good enough as soon as Daesh is driven out of Syria for people to return. If the civil war keeps going it will still be a war torn country where civilians are massively endangered, especially since civil wars often happen to not necessarily abide by the conventions of warfare and so on. So this will most certainly take a couple more years until the flow back will be noticeable.

And yes, those that did integrate in the mean time might seek to stay. And why not if they integrated well, if they are qualified and able to further our society.

I still feel a little sceptical with studies like this that touch highly controversial political topics. I still remember our election race with all its ""we aren't safe within our homes anymore, so many more burglaries happen"" and in December the BKA said that burglary numbers are falling for the second year in a row.

And yes, of course there will be criminals within the huge group of refugees coming here. Take a sample of 500k refugees who arrived here in the last three years and then take a sample of 500k Germans, there will be criminals in both groups. Still it will never be comparable because you won't find a group of 500k Germans who had to flee religious fanatics and civil war and have finally arrived in the promised land of riches and sweets where they suddenly are stuck within bureaucracy they don't understand and without something meaningful to do nor any way to effectively and legally work on bettering their status in society.

Saying that one understands, what might drive people to commit a crime does not mean to defend or support what they did.

And yes, of course there have been a lot of mistakes during this whole ordeal that now, down the road, lead to bigger issues and the authorities not knowing a lot of stuff that they ought to know. But this won't get better from torching refugee homes or spinning a nationalist agenda.

latbol,,,"When social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter first set off and were getting established, their goal was to improve how human beings connected with one another and to foster an alternative platform that could be used to strengthen human bonds and relationships. It’s clear today that they have grown and morphed into something a lot more sinister. Twitter has become a tool to sow division. No one understands the power of Twitter more than President Donald Trump, who continues to use the medium as a way to rally his strongest supporters and to alienate those with opposing views. Many feel that Facebook played a large role in the 2016 US presidential election and it has been accused of helping to foment genocidal violence, in Myanmar for instance. Uber’s business practices have been questioned. Bitcoin is being viewed with suspicion, and sometimes even called a “fraud” by people like Jamie Dimon.

American sociopolitical debate, and Europe’s heavy fines on firms such as Google have made it clear that Silicon Valley’s CEOs are no longer just start-up founders and software product builders. They have become society’s leaders and oligarchs in their own right and have the ability shape our opinions and our political leanings. And yes, they can also contribute in various ways in shaping the political milieu by influencing which politicians we vote into office. This influence is in no way contained to America and Europe, savvy politicians the world over, including here in India, have learnt how to harness the power of these platforms for their own political purposes and agendas.

Western commentary has started to focus on how such innovators need to consider the massive sociopolitical ramifications of their inventions, and how they must act responsibly in the light of the immense power they now hold. Susan Wu, a veteran American investor and tech evangelist neatly circumscribes current thinking there in an op-ed piece for Wired magazine: “The tech industry can either design for and build positive externalities, or we can inflict many negative ones—job displacement, fracturing of neighbourhoods, addictive behaviours, compounding isolation, fortifying tribalism, and widening income inequality, to name a few.”

My view is that such navel-gazing and contemplation among America’s technology elite is welcome, and that it might actually allow for these firms to start thinking of the broader ramifications of their work, and allow them, over the longer term, to work in concert with each other to maximize the common good. Tech leaders have been responding, partly through publicly genuflecting to such commentary and partly by trying to respond with action, such as vetting posts for violence and “fake news”.

Unfortunately for us in India, none of our information technology (IT) services titans seem to be thinking in this manner. During the early days of the industry when India’s governments wanted to give a fillip to employment, many of these firms enjoyed long tax-holidays through various schemes such as the Software Technology Parks of India or STPI, where one could simply build one’s own campus anywhere, comply with a scant set of rules to declare the campus as an STPI, and proceed to enjoy tax benefits denied to the rest of Indian industry. When pressed on whether these tax benefits were unfair, the usual response of these tech titans was that these benefits were certainly not unfair, since the people they employed were now contributing to India’s exchequer through income tax and other taxes levied on tech employees. To me, this was a rather disingenuous view; let’s not forget that the employees of firms who were not in the tech sector were also paying their taxes, while their non-tech employers were also contributing to the exchequer by coughing up taxes at a company level.

India’s tech-boom has laid waste to our cities. As real estate developers sought to cash in on the unprecedented migration into our cities caused by technology workers employed at India’s top IT companies, and by Western companies such as Accenture, Cisco, and IBM, our once salubrious (though not necessarily well-planned) cities have been reduced to concrete jungles with inadequate roads, falling water tables, questionable sewerage and drainage systems, and choking pollution. A study from the Indian Institute of Science says that Bengaluru might become unlivable by 2020. The thought boggles the mind, but just a day spent getting to and from a tech company’s offices in Bengaluru underscores how true that study may really turn out to be.

As the tech boom has stalled and new hiring has slowed to a crawl, many of the real estate developers are left holding the bag with a large inventory of unsold homes and unleased office space, all hastily built up in a naïve anticipation of never ending growth. Some of our cities now look like the banks of a polluted river that has receded after a flood. Debris are strewn everywhere, in the form of lost jobs, dashed hopes, and increasing crime.

During our conversations over coffee or dinner, we like to place the blame for our crumbling cities squarely on India’s governments at the city, state, and national levels. While ruing India’s lack of infrastructure probably has some merit, placing the blame for our crumbling cities solely on the government is unfair. Just as the Americans have called their tech titans (all of them firms who are not government owned) to the carpet to answer for the changing social construct in America, we should be naming and shaming our tech titans by holding them accountable for what has happened to our cities while they enjoyed their tax holidays.

While a small minority of the founders of these firms have publicly announced their intention to contribute to charity, very many have not.

Project Fear was more 'out on our own', 'draw-bridge up', 'isolated', yadda-yadda-yadda.  Later coming from the government it would include emergency budgets, tax hikes, and emergency slasher spending cuts.

Here, in the government leaflet, they spelled out different scenarios saying if we stayed in the Single Market it'd include accepting EU law, European Courts, continuing EU contributions, and Freedom of Movement.  If we didn't pursue that option, as was the government's opinion that we wouldn't, that a trade agreements could be made but it would be a process that takes years.  The Leave campaign then took a line that we should take back control of our laws, courts, borders, and contributions.  The PM and Chancellor then reaffirmed that doing that meant leaving the SM and CU (whilst still pledging to carry it out), and we would have to negotiate with the EU and there no promises could be made.  We certainly knew from looking at the Conservative membership and frontrunners that if it wasn't Cameron carrying it out it'd certainly be someone even more committed.  Leave could speculate why a deal should be forthcoming, but anybody that understood what 'negotiate' means shouldn't have been left in any doubt.

But sure, lots of people said lots of things from lots of sides and included their own spin and bias.  That's pretty much every referendum and election for those who this was their first rodeo.

As it was, it remains, the Davis criteria was met because people were informed by the government of the day, who were set to implement it, what it would mean, and then we had a drawn out referendum campaign where both sides made their case and attacked the other's position.

I struggle to find any sympathy for people saying they didn't know what the vote meant, or how it would play out, because all the information was out there.  Reading through the spin of both sides there'd be a process, trade would be discussed on the premise of leaving both the SM and CU, and it wouldn't happen overnight but would take years.

Well, here we are.

bearcanyons,,,"Alright, thanks for responding, but I have one thing to say: go back to Europe.  I assume that’s where your heritage stems back to if you’re a white nationalist.  So, if black people should go back to Africa, and Asian people should go back to Asia, then you should go back to Europe with me and all of your “European” friends.  For better or for worse, white slavers brought black people to the US, and for better or for worse they have created their own, distinct culture.  African Americans are Africans as much as I am German-Irish: only in heritage.  If you think that all races should go back to where they came from, everyone except Native Americans should leave.  And if we go back far enough, even they should cross the land bridge back to Asia.

As for your other arguments: it really seems like you want to kind of sweep all of our issues under the rug by deporting every non-white in the country.  I obviously don’t agree with doing this, but I’ll just try to use practical arguments rather than my opinion to debate this.  In the United States, there are around 230 million white people, 39 million black people, 16 million Asian people, and 9 million people of mixed race.  If you deported all non-whites to where they were originally from, you would be depriving around 65 million people in total.  That would have major repercussions on the economy, social structure, and would be completely against the constitution.  Also, think about moral issues: what about mixed race families?  If someone is half black and half white, should they go back to Africa?  Should a black-white couple both be deported?  And also, maybe black people don’t want to go back to Africa, because black people are human beings, have grown up with American culture, and aren’t stupid animals that have primal instincts to flock home.

If you want to solve these issues, just about the worst thing you can do is just get rid of all non-whites.  These people, while you may see them as unintelligent and violent, have as much of a right to live here as you and me.  I, myself, have known plenty of normal, non murdering black peoples in my life, and many have lead successful lives.  There are many many problems with black gang culture.  But we won’t fix these problems by sending them over to Africa.  We’ll fix them over time, and hopefully (as I said originally) eventually have a nation with as equal rights as possible for everyone.

saijanai,,,"&gt;No, not at all. It's a term referring to the method, not the effects. 

&gt;As long as the method is not directive then it's a non-directive meditation.

IF the practice is reducing the activity of the default mode network, than it is not truly ""non-directive.""

It is very literally the case that we now have a physiological measurement of genuine effortlessness: whether or not the default mode network's activity is less active than during normal eyes closed rest. TM is the only well-studied meditation practice that does NOT reduce the activity of the DMN.

If the practice is decreasing the activity of the DMN, there is some kind of effort or control  involved no matter how it is described.

The devil is in the details of *how* the practice is taught, not just the description. You can call anything you want, anything you like, but if it involves effort and control (reduces the activity of the DMN), then it is not ""non-directive.""

This is the physiological basis of the ancient tradition that claims that one cannot teach meditation of this type through reason or logic: it is an intuitive process that requires an intuitive teacher. 

.

_Taught by an inferior man this Self cannot be easily known,_

_even though reflected upon. Unless taught by one_

_who knows him as none other than his own Self,_

_there is no way to him, for he is subtler than subtle,_

_**beyond the range of reasoning.**_

_**Not by logic can this realization be won**. Only when taught_

_by another, [an enlightened teacher], is it easily known,_

_dearest friend._

-Katha Upanishad, I.2.8-9

.



Maharishi claimed he could sidestep this issue via the interactive teaching play that TM teachers learn. The TM teacher need not be enlightened, but merely wiling to faithfully follow the teaching method he/she was trained to use. Claiming that any ole book or webpage or youtube video has the same effect, without being able to back it up via physiological research, is unwarranted, IMHO. As I probably pointed out, Maharishi got a lot of flack, back in the day, for claiming this.

Random teachers, books, youtube videos, etc., appear to be written by people who aren't aware of the tradition, or at least, dismiss it as complete claptrap (as you did in an earlier comment).


.


&gt;The rest is irrelevant.


Only if you think that the brain's actual physical activity is irrelevant to ""spirituality.""

Maharishi Mahesh Yogi was the first spiritual leader to call for the scientific study of meditation and enlightenment, saying:

""_Every experience has its level of physiology, and so unbounded awareness has its own level of physiology which can be measured. Every aspect of life is integrated and connected with every other phase. When we talk of scientific measurements, it does not take away from the spiritual experience. We are not responsible for those times when spiritual experience was thought of as metaphysical. Everything is physical. Consciousness is the product of the functioning of the brain. Talking of scientific measurements is no damage to that wholeness of life which is present everywhere and which begins to be lived when the physiology is taking on a particular form. This is our understanding about spirituality: it is not on the level of faith --it is on the level of blood and bone and flesh and activity. It is measurable._""

.

&gt;Heck, I'm not even sure Avaita Vedanta sees strengthening the sense of self positively!

As _Advaita Vedanta_ is a philosophy, it doesn't ""see"" anything. People who accept Maharishi's interpretation of _Advaita Vedanta_ and other spiritual traditions tend to agree with him on things: spirituality described in the Yoga Sutras, the writings of Shankara, the Upanishads, etc., is based on the physical functioning of the brain, and so when there is a discussion of ""Self"" in these ancient texts, they are talking about a specific style of functioning of the brain where, however it emerges, the brain's activity resembles that found during TM's ""Pure Consciousness."" This is the definition of ""enlightenment"" that Maharishi developed, and many highly placed people in the Indian government have adopted [the research on the topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/transcendental/comments/7djr03/a_bunch_of_research_on_tm_pure_consciousness_and/) whole-heartedly, including Prime Minister Modi and his [Minster of Yoga and Ayurveda, S. Y. Naik.](https://www.easterneye.eu/ayurveda-cure-ailing-nhs/)

They seem to agree with Maharishi's evaluation of _Advaita Vedanta_ and its relationship to other aspects of Indian culture, such as Ayurveda. In fact, earlier this year, Minister Naik gave the first keynote address at [Harvard University's Second  International Conference on Integrative Medicine: Role of Yoga and Ayurveda in Pain and Addiction Management](http://www.indiapost.com/harvard-meet-for-joining-best-of-east-west-medicines/) and  then graciously introduced the second keynote speaker, Richard Schneider of Maharishi University of Management, to talk about the scientific study of Ayurveda and Yoga.

I can't prove that it was the machinations of the Indian government that got Dr Schneider the second keynote slot at Harvard U, but seeing how it is the home of Herbert Benson and his relaxation response, it seems unlikely that Harvard U would invite a speaker to attend whose topic another Harvard Professor has attempted to repudiate for 40+ years unless someone reasonably influential insisted.

.

Schneider, incidentally, was the correspondent with Robert Brook in the _Letters to the Editor_ exchange who was trying to get Brook to bump TM from Class IIB to Class IIA in the AHA's scientific statement we were discussing (just to tie this comment in with the rest of the discussion). In that _Letters_ exchange, Brook characterised Schneider's research as ""unique in its quality"" amongst meditation research and hypertension. He was later a guest at the TM university in Iowa where he described his own research and again complemented Schneider on his. 

That same scientific statement said that [despite 40 years of research by Harvard U and others], relaxation practices like ""the Relaxation Response"" didn't have the research to give it higher than a _Class III, no benefit_ rating. which was another slap in the face at Harvard to have Schneider give the second keynote address (again, I don't see Harvard organizers doing this on their own, but only at the request of Naik and/or Modi).",True,0,1514993957,,1514999120,0,ds4q3x7,False,t3_7iwbul,t1_ds4h85u,/r/Buddhism/comments/7iwbul/the_heart_of_the_path_is_so_simple/ds4q3x7/,1517523914,1,False,Buddhism,t5_2qhnf,public,True

In Xcom theres this thing called Elerium which is also an alien material. Also contains a large amount of energy. And Also is used to power strong weapons. Also also it causes zombie-like behavior with long term exposure.

During, but not necessarily because of.

Of course. I'm not going to have an answer to you, because I'm not an economics expert, and a question that large is going to have many, many factors. 

At this stage it's impossible to know how well the UK would have done outside the EU. 

I personally am also not ideologically attached to the EU. I see benefits from our membership, but I'm not emotionally attached to it.

If the benefits were clear on leaving I would be for it. But they are not. And I the main reasons I see for leaving by most Brexiteers are not practical in nature, but idological. Emotional. Indeed we were told time and time again that we have NO IDEA what would happen by leaving - by the leave campaign and Farage as well.

Now, if we see an economic upturn, or the economy stabilises then fine. It was no problem to leave. 

Indeed if we see an upturn then by all means Brexiteers can crow about how they were right all day long. Again, I have no ideological attachment.

I wish I agreed.

What happened in America is weird. You look at the republicans and their funders - people like Koch. Now it's important to separate two groups here and one I'm not interested in. The sort of traditionally conservative, old-school racist. There's not much economics to their thinking - or even political philosophy outside of change is bad. Their should be rules, we should follow them. Authoritarian towards a structure of ideals, manners, social rules, social order - rather than a king. And some actual sort of outright white-supremacists.

The other group - people like Koch and the small-government right-wing - are basically happy to do whatever to shrink the state. Including poke these nationalistic beehives. They preach removing the cronyism from capitalism (check out Koch's interview with freakanomics) but are happy to wield their riches to elect whatever clown will quid-pro-quo them a minimal state. The danger is those 30% of Trump voters that will hang on no matter what are not beholden to Koch - they hate him. 

What happens when these people realise they aren't getting their ethno-state? They won't bring back coal? The immigrants aren't leaving? Leaving the EU won't fill their communities with white faces? More powerful vacuums won't bring back good jobs?

I'm not saying all right-wing voters want these things. There's the small statists, the racists and the moderates. I'm saying - especially in the US - the political game that's being played to win power through, not just appealing to, but actively convincing these angry disillusioned people to worry about these things will bite us all in the arse. Fox News is [actively](https://mainlymacro.blogspot.co.at/2017/09/economists-show-how-fox-news-changes.html) manipulating. I'd be willing to bet our media landscape is doing the same.

I find it sort of ironic as neoliberal/libertarian thought (starting in the modern rather than the proto right-libertarian times) was a response to the Nazis and their authoritarian attitudes. Now they're basically leaning on them to get into power.

AspirinTheory,,,"Thanks, almeuit. 

For you VZW workers, here was my thinking. 

For background, I travel internationally a LOT. 95 days out of the country last year, all but 9 days for business. I travel frequently to Western Europe, Japan, and Southeast Asia. 

When I reviewed international costs for me last year, I averaged about $12.65/mo on T-Mobile. Why? Phone calls. T-Mobile’s international plans have additional per-minute calling rates. Although I get texts and data for free, the data speeds can be pretty poor. 

In the UK and Germany in October last year, I slummed through 64k speed connections for Google Maps and transit apps. It worked, albeit slowly, but I was unable to get whatsApp voice calls to consistently work, forcing me to use voice minutes for phone calls. This is despite me paying $25/mo for T-Mobile’s ONE International Plus plan. When I recently asked T-Mobile technical support about these low data speeds, they said they only guarantee 2G connectivity. Ugh. 

Speaking with VZW tech support, they said I should expect 4G or LTE speeds nearly everywhere I go and that there is no data throttling they are aware of in overseas markets for VZW roaming customers. Also, the $10/day calling plan includes unlimited voice minutes. 

This is a big deal, as it effectively neutralized my “T-Mobile is cheaper and better overseas!” argument to myself. 

Without a big international difference, the slightly higher monthly fee for Verizon domestic signal coverage coupled with better overall coverage became a no-brainer. 

However: I will tell you that the systems within VZW I had to fight through to get my port over and working was super bureaucratic and is one thing T-Mobile CS has over VZW. However I do find better, more human CS reps at VZW than T-Mo. 

Anyway, my two cents. Happy New Year, belatedly.

Do you think Vietnam was a ""showoff""? You're a moron who knows nothing about how conflicts work.

&gt;eh? how about no? how is random European country with practically zero military power yet decent economy and great standard of living comparable to for example no Korea or Russia which both invest massively in the military?

So many errors in here. Most random European countries with good economies don't have ""zero military power"". Sweden has undetectable submarines that can sink the entire US navy, including all the aircraft carriers.

&gt;by your logic every country in the world who is not the US (therefore is not a ""world hegemon"" and ""military superpower"") is fucked? like.. lol?

Pretty much, if you don't want China meddling in your country. If you look at the covert or overt US operations that happened in pretty much every country of the world that's a bleak prospect.

fihsbogor,,He loves everybody,"&gt; yet they are ashamed of their own culture.

To be brutally honest, I kinda am. A lot of the causes of this country's stagnation can be traced back to our traditional culture. Japan and Korea adopted the industrious culture of the West, do you think they would be successful and prosperous today if they acted in a reactionary way and refused to adapt to Western ways? The more European Indonesia will be, the more successful this country will become. 

&gt; The way I see it, even naming convention can be a part of cultural imperialism.

Cultural imperialism is not necessarily a bad thing. If we were under the influence of European culture, it's a good thing, but if we are under the Arabic cultural influence like today, this country won't change for the better. Arab countries rely on natural resources to preserve their wealth, while the Europeans used their industry and service sector to provide income, so Europeans are more diligent. We have to imitate the Europeans, just like China, Taiwan, Singapore, Japan and Korea do, and let go of the Arabic influence on our culture. 

&gt;We all hate Soeharto's Orba, but if he didn't force people of Chinese descent to adopt Javanese or other ""local"" names, more Chinese people these days would be more likely to associate themselves with China instead of Indonesia, politically.

To force a certain group of people to take names that don't belong to that group is an atrocity. The Chinese Indonesians had to let go some of the aspects of their culture, which made them disconnected to their identity. I also completely disagree about the Chinese Indonesians being less loyal to the country. China in the 60s until late 80s was a repressive communist state, I don't think the Chinese Indonesians, of which a large percentage of them are practitioners of capitalism, would look up to China as their real country. If Orba never repressed Chinese culture in Indonesia and discriminated against the Chinese Indonesians, the Chinese Indonesians would have more trust and loyalty to the government and the state. Just look at Singapore, Chinese culture isn't repressed there, and people can give whatever names their culture has. How many Chinese Singaporeans align themselves with China, and how many Tamil Singaporeans align themselves with India?

housedengue,southsidewest,New City,"The two month vacation is a definite perk, but many teachers do required professional development (most states require this to keep the teaching license) or attend conferences during some of it, so not all of it is spent at the beach. That's what I meant by ""it's not as long as you think"".

Every job has its perks though. People who work outside of education are able to take a 1hr lunch, go to a restaurant, go to the bathroom when they need to, or spend half the day browsing Reddit if it's slow.

Also, don't forget that teachers cannot take time off throughout the year unless it's a sickness or family emergency. If we had a Monday off for a holiday, we weren't allowed to take the Friday off unless we got approval far in advance. Want to go to Europe with your family in October for two weeks because it's cheaper and less crowded? Nope! And many of the days that students get off are required work days for teachers.

Lastly, don't forget that some teachers are not paid during the summer. I was not paid at all in June, July, or August. My salary was simply divided up into the other 9 months.

I try to defend teachers whenever I can. I think CPS teachers can be unreasonable at times, but most teachers are severely underpaid for the amount of hours they put in. Many even spend money out of their own pockets on supplies. 

For me, having to not do any work at night or on the weekends is the biggest perk of leaving the teaching field. I miss the summers off, but would much rather have my weekends and evenings free.

Só no ano passado, o RJ teve reforço em fevereiro, durante o movimento de esposas de PMs que bloqueavam a saída de batalhões, e a partir de julho, em várias operações integradas com as forças estaduais de segurança. Em 2016, foram mais de R$ 69 milhões, com três intervenções militares em diferentes estados. Comparação com outros estados De 2015 a 2017, foram gastos R$ 50 milhões em operações em presídios em todo o território nacional. As eleições municipais de 2016 demandaram R$ 42 milhões em todo o país. Os R$ 75 milhões gastos no Estado do Rio de Janeiro se destacam em comparação com outras unidades da federação.

In North America the nostalgia for Nintendo is *far* stronger than any other gaming brand - if you grew up in the '80s and '90s in America, you had a Nintendo.

As a Brit living in Canada, it can get tiresome. There's more to life than Nintendo and it irks me when I see collections that feature nothing else.

lord_darovit,121,,"&gt;Where are any of these feats?

In the EU if you actually read anything about Sidious.

&gt;Also mastering the 7 forms isn't all that impressive, every battlemaster has done that.

Except Sidious has fluently mastered them all to a T. Battlemasters haven't. People like Cin Drallig don't have the same level of knowledge in lightsaber combat as Sidious.

&gt;Starkiller has done more DBZ level shit with the force than Sidious.

[No he hasn't.] (http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64880/3526018-2721837233-26681.jpg) Starkiller also got utterly [destroyed by Sidious.] (https://youtu.be/-W4RSzyDoRE?t=43)

&gt;Vitiate/Valkorian actually attained immortality

No he didn't. He used [essence transfer] (http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Transfer_essence) over the centuries on various people while unchallenged inside of his Empire. Sidious [literally utilized the same power,] (https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/5/52/Emperorreborn.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130630223512). By your logic Sidious is immortal as well since he uses the same ability to stay alive as Valkorion. The only reason Sidious didn't keep coming back over and over infinitely as well is because literally every single dead Jedi from beyond the void realized how much of a threat he was, and they all dog piled him and had to drag him down. That's countless billions of Jedi spirits that had to fight to keep his spirit from returning. Valkorion is small chips compared to Sidious, and the Jedi knew that.

&gt;and possessed and killed entire planets with the force.

Sidious is able to do the same thing with force storms:

*This is perhaps the single most destructive Force power known. This power allows the Jedi to twist the space-time continuum to create vast storms of force. The power also allows limited control of these storms. Capable of creating annihilating vortices, the storms can swallow whole fleets of spaceships or tear the surfaces off worlds.*

--Dark Empire Sourcebook

Not only that, but he's capable of casting force storms instantly, and from across the galaxy:

*“...and I have come to realize that the dark side is my only ally. The dark side is the only means to power. My explorations of the Force have revealed to me many wonderful secrets. I have learned that Anger and Will, when joined together, forge a most unholy and devastating alliance. Using Anger, I have learned to unlock the hidden reservoirs of the glorious dark side power. Anger concentrated by Will in the vital center of the body creates a portal, through which vast energies are released. The energies of the dark side of the Force. This is the power I command, now that I am one with the dark side. With these energies, I have slain my enemies across the empty reaches of space. I have created lightning, and unleashed devastating fires. With this knowledge, I can unleash dark side energies that swirl invisibly around us, even to shatter the fabric of space itself. In this way, I have created Storms.”*

--Palpatine’s hologram recording, Dark Empire

[Valkorion can't do this.] (https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11129/111293023/5903657-byss2.jpg) In fact Valkorion is so much weaker that it takes him time and basically long rituals to unleash power of that magnitude, while Sidious is able to execute destruction of that level on command, whenever he wants.

&gt;Not sure where/when Sidious did anything on that level, he's a great character/villain so I'm not hating on the guy but he hasn't done anything to warrant being called the strongest Sith of all time.

Except all of the feats he's done in the EU. I just think you haven't read anything about Sidious. Not only does he show that he's much more powerful than every Sith, there's multiple unbiased quotes that state he is blatantly the strongest Sith of all time in the galaxies history.

&gt;He's also didn't have the largest Empire

Yes he did. The Galactic Empire is the largest empire ever created in all of Star Wars. 

&gt;Krayt controlled at least an equal amount of territory

Krayt's Empire is comparable, it's still not as large. Krayt's is still missing chunks of space from the Fel Empire and Galactic Alliance. The galaxy during that time is also still recovering from the Vong War, so the worlds he draws resources from are weaker. 

&gt;and Vitiate controlled 2 entire Empires simultaneously.

Vitiate's Empire is laughably small compared to the Galactic Empire or even Krayt's. You can't be serious. He didn't dominate the galaxy like Sidious and Krayt did. He's like a side faction compared to them.

&gt;He didn't need Vader to be a henchman, he needed him because he knew Anakin could become much more powerful than him.

He needed him because he needed an enforcer to snuff out any rogue cults and rebellions in his Empire, and Vader was powerful enough to do the job. If Vader had never been placed in the suit either, he likely planned to possess Anakin's body via essence transfer. 

&gt;In terms of the rule of two granting the Sith power they've never seen I'd vehemently disagree. In the 100's of years after Bane only Sidious managed anything on a galactic level whereas before that the Sith were taking/vying for control of the galaxy on a relatively consistent basis.

The Sith during the Old Republic constantly failed, and a great many of them were fodder compared to the rule of two Sith. Literally the entire point of the rule of two was for the Sith to hide in the shadows and wait. Coming out and assaulting the Jedi directly would be absolutely stupid, as it clearly didn't work in the past. While the Sith hid in the shadows, they'd train and bide their time and become more powerful mentally and physically.

&gt;They had it for the Great Galactic War, Jedi Civil War, and the Great Hyperspace war and after the rule Krayt took it from both the Empire and the Republic.

The Sith DID NOT control the galaxy during these times. Huh? Literally the only Sith who ACTUALLY took control of the vast majority of the galaxy were Sidious and Krayt, and the difference between those two is that Sidious is ridiculously more powerful than Krayt because of the rule of two and his culmination of knowledge of Sith that came before him. Krayt didn't follow the same path, and is clearly less powerful as an individual and less impressive in combat.

the reason why they failed, is the same why in Baltic states all the former Soviet factories failed and died. They were never made to compete in a market economy. Those Soviet era factories made outdated, shit quality products that nobody in their right mind would never buy voluntarily, if they had other options available. And of course, when the Iron curtain fell and people in Eastern Europe gained access to Western products, they dropped Russian products immediately. Nobudy would buy a Russian made car, if they could get a German one instead. So the only factories that survived in Russia to this day are either military factories (which can still compete with Western weapons), or very very cheap products that can compete just in the price department (even those have a hard time, because China or India can lower the price on their stuff even more than Russians can).

&gt; there have been cases where the rear seat occupants who fastened their seat belts were saved. **""But a child seated between them went flying out of the front of the car.** Without seat belts in the rear seats, in an accident, the heads of the passengers may collide, leading to grievous injuries,...

A foxhole radio is a makeshift radio that was first used by soldiers in World War II, specifically at Anzio, spreading later across the European and Pacific theaters. There were different versions of the foxhole radio; all used a safety razor blade as a radio wave detector. The ""classic"" foxhole radio was configured like a crystal radio, with the blade acting as the crystal and a wire, safety pin, or, later, a pencil serving as the cat's whisker. Other versions were similar to the microphone detector of David Edward Hughes, rediscovered by Harry Shoemaker and Walter Wentworth Massie, popular among amateurs in the early days of radio.

Carthagefield,,,"&gt; Since there was nothing to fear, we can explain this mostly with simple jelousy and ignorance stemming hate.

Jewish success in Germany was only a minor cause of antisemitic attitudes of the time. It's also worth remembering that Jews had only recently been emancipated in Europe, with Jews in (pre-unification) Germany having been forced to live in [segregated ghettos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurter_Judengasse) until ~1800 in crushing poverty, with no access to higher education and banned from most trades.

The driving force of Nazi antisemitism is rooted in two social phenomenons of the early 20th century. Firstly, the [German Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Revolution_of_1918%E2%80%9319) at the end of WWI had a very strong communist element, and because of the prominence of Jews like Rosa Luxemburg and [Karl Liebknecht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Liebknecht) in the revolution, as well as the Bolsheviks in Russia who had overthrown the Russian Tsars a year earlier, communism was widely seen as a Jewish conspiracy that threatened to destroy the fabric of European civilisation.

Secondly, the large waves of immigration of (mostly poor) Jewish refugees from Eastern Europe since the late 19th century induced a sentiment of anti-immigration in Germany similar to the modern Syrian refugee crisis. In 1938 after Germany had annexed Austria and made almost a million German and Austrian Jews stateless, the western powers including Britain and the USA [refused to take in these refugees](http://www.irinnews.org/analysis/2015/11/18), whilst hypocritically at the same time criticising Germany for their antisemitic policies. Hitler responded in a speech later that year by blaming Jewish immigration from Eastern Europe: *""They complain… of the boundless cruelty with which Germany - and now Italy also - seek to rid themselves of their Jewish elements. All these great democratic empires taken together have only a handful of people to the square kilometre. Both in Italy and Germany there are over 140. Yet formerly Germany, without blinking an eyelid, for whole decades admitted these Jews by the hundred thousand. But now… when the nation is no longer willing to be sucked dry by these parasites, on every side one hears nothing but laments. But lamentations have not led these democratic countries to substitute helpful activity at last for their hypocritical questions; on the contrary, these countries with icy coldness assured us that obviously there was no place for the Jews in their territory. … So no help is given, but morality is saved.""*",True,0,1515008899,,1515117698,0,ds54khv,False,t3_7nlxfb,t1_ds4ww20,/r/CringeAnarchy/comments/7nlxfb/jewish_woman_with_a_high_iq_tries_to_hit_on_an/ds54khv/,1517531901,10,False,CringeAnarchy,t5_35j1r,public,
Carl555,BELG,Belgium,"&gt; That might be ""a"" point, but it's certainly not ""the"" point. Another point is that in order for democracy to work you need to at least know who will be in office depending on how you vothe. Voters had a good idea that Merkel or May would be the leader if their parties won the elections. Voters didn't know who Juncker was before the election.

This isn't always the case. In Belgium for instance things were less obvious. The biggest party didn't want to have the PM-position, so instead they offered it to a smaller party to get them onboard of their coalition. Most parliamentary systems allow a lot of liberty in this regard and i'm not sure whether there are a lot of rules to prevent someone totally different as a PM. It's not a bad thing per se seeing as PM's are merely the coach of their government.

&gt; He controls the legislative agenda. He decides what types of legislation even gets considered. Yeah, that's considerable. Even if a majority of the EU parliament want a law to be passed, Juncker can prevent it from occurring because he controls the legislative initiative. The EU parliament can't write or initiate its own laws like a normal parliament. Juncker basically has a unilateral veto in EU legislation. That's even more powerful than an American president's veto, which can be overridden by 2/3's of Congress

No. You are confusing two things: ""the president of the commission"" and ""THE commission"". Juncker is the president of the commission, but he can't decide things alone. These powers reside with THE comission as a whole. (And as you know, the members of the commission are appointed and approved by the governments of the member states and the parliament.) This is a HUGE difference, especially when we talk about the specific role of Juncker.

Contrary to Juncker, Trump literally calls a lot of the shots by himself. He doesn't have to answer to anybody within his government because he has been directly elected. All of the secretaries of state are below him in the hierarchy of government. Obviously the Congres and the Senate are also elected seperately, so he has to take their opinion into account wherever the constitution requires him to do so.",True,0,1515008934,,1515009380,0,ds54lrx,False,t3_7ntste,t1_ds4n7ai,/r/europe/comments/7ntste/why_europe_is_willing_to_regulate_tech_more_than/ds54lrx/,1517531919,1,False,europe,t5_2qh4j,public,

&gt;But other economists assert that the weak growth in wages is an indicator of a new economic order in which working people are at the mercy of their employers. Unions have lost clout. Companies are relying on temporary and part-time workers while deploying robots and other forms of automation in ways that allow them to produce more without paying extra to human beings.

Whirlvvind,,,"&gt;So how is it I don’t understand physics but you restate my exact point and then not even address my other supporting examples?

I didn't address your other examples because they didn't relate to the incorrect thrust ""complaint"". You're absolutely correct about how SW ships fly like they are in atmosphere (because Lucas literally rotoscoped plane dogfights for A New Hope), though it is possible that the ships are simply going much faster than it seems on the screen and thus the amount of energy to do an axis spin and change direction noticeably is too much to be feasible for fighter combat (not to mention acceleration forces on the pilot). Likely not though and its just a legacy of Lucas.

Characters being blown into space could entirely be intact. If you're not right next to the actual explosion then you're only blown into space because of rapid decompression. It is a common myth that rapid decompression causes a body to explode.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncontrolled_decompression
 There would certainly be lung trauma at minimum (not to mention the fact Leia wouldn't have just stopped before she ""decided"" to come back, she'd have been blown damn far and still have been moving, not to mention the high likely hood of debris shotgunning her on her way back), but just being blown out into space doesn't directly translate to dismemberment.

Lastly, I don't restate your point about the ""gas"" at all. You say that having enough gas to stay ahead is ludicrous because there is nothing to slow you down. While partially correct in that there isn't enough to slow a ship down the statement as a whole is misleading because as I said even if there is nothing to slow you down, if a ship constantly burns then there is constant acceleration. Ships that no longer have the fuel to burn lose that acceleration, thus continue at the speed they attained before their fuel ran out, and thus fall behind the other ships that are then still burning fuel and still accelerating.

Now it entirely is a plot mechanic that the ships apparently have the same thrust capabilities, that no first order ship doesn't just make some micro light speed jump (or even just calculate a jump out and then a jump back in ahead of the fleeing ships), that they have magic FTL tracking tech, etc.

I never once said that the space chase made any logical sense as a whole or that it wasn't a completely contrived nonsense plot (#notmystarwars, gimme back the original EU that made sense. How is there a resistance movement in the first movie when you have an established government? How is a galactic government's entire fleet somehow only around a couple planets at its core?

ergele,,,"There are many comments here and I am sure this will go unnoticed, still as a Turkish Citizen I would like to provide some info and my opinion on this.


NATO is not a cultural alliance, neither it is upholder of democracy or freedom. It's a military alliance and a bit non-binding on that. NATO members can still buy weapons and armaments from non-NATO members. So Turkey's internal politics shouldn't effect it's membership on NATO.

Turkey played the ball with NATO during the Cold War and was considered a trusted ally thus received a lot of support from NATO countries. A quick look on Turkish Armed Forces inventory shows that Turkey has 2000+ battle tanks yet couldn't repair the tanks that got damaged during Euphrates Shield operation. This shows how much Turkish industry relies on external support.

Due to that and Turkish Army's quantity, Turks now have arguably strongest military on paper in Middle East. Turning Turkey into a capable regional power and less of a buffer state. This wouldn't be a problem if Turkey was still on line with West's best interests but currently she is not.

After the coup attempt, ruling party turned into a paranoid state, jailing high ranking beurocrats and even having internal disputes in their party. Currently there are reports of camps training civillians (tho I believe it is a far fetch from opposition, which I support) in warfare, arguably by some contractors named Sadat.

This, of course can be seen on international relations. Turkey is now acting on it's own interests warming ties with Russia and Iran even cooperating with Iraq. S400 deal shows that.

Currently, Turkey is making the best out of the rift between Russia and NATO. Due to Russia's isolated state, Moscow had to warm the ties with Turkey, despite the jet crisis and Turkey was okay with that since the government isn't trusting West anymore after the denial of extradiction of Gulen. 

What will it take for Turkey to be back on board? Here are some possible solutions that I can think of :

Extradiction of Gulen and stopping the support on YPG: This would probably warm the ties between U.S. and Turkey and might bring Turkey back on board.

Change of Government: I believe that is highly unlikely but If the new alternative right wing opposition party (which is using the same tactic AKP once used to win the elections) has started their campaign. They can't get media attention due to AKP but they are visiting houses and talking with voters in person.


West mends their relations with Russia:
Now that seems the most unlikely out of three but if that was to happen I believe Turkey would face either isolation or has to choose sides. In that case I believe Turkey would prefer NATO.


But currently, I think U.S. and EU is tolerating the current Turkish Government but hopes and seeks a better alternative.

ANITIX87,,,"It's not the airport that has to recover, it's the airlines. That makes a big difference and aids in explaining the issue.

Let's say Delta has one flight per day between two cities. On Monday, they cancel the flight, stranding 250 passengers.  Tuesday's flight has 15 open seats, so they re-book 15 people.  Their partner airline, Air France, has 11 open seats on the same route, so that's another 11 taken care of.  This can easily snowball (though we're assuming two well-connected city pairs).

Now let's assume Delta's flight is the *only* flight each day. Well, Delta will ALWAYS have extra aircraft sitting around as spares (whether they're awaiting maintenance checks or because all airlines pad their schedules). Therefore, they can send one of these extra aircraft.  For instance, let's say there's one flight per day from Atlanta to Boise, which gets canceled.  But Delta also has a plane that sits in Atlanta all day awaiting a flight to Europe at night. They can then take this aircraft while it normally would have been sitting and run and a round-trip to Boise if needed.

Lastly, the airline can prioritize key flights to recover. Once the weather improves, the airline can ferry empty aircraft around its network to be ready for the next day and have planes where it needs them most (it may mean sacrificing other flights, but their dispatching and booking systems can handle this easily to determine which cancellations will have the fewest ripples).

Politically, german people may not stand behind America, especially now that trump's president, but will still accept most decisions as the ""american way"" of managing things. Our government is not US critical.
generally, we see america as the personalisation of capitalism (that's because we have many american tv shows here which are mocking their own state that way, for example the simpsons) . That may or may not be a good thing, it really depends on who you are talking to. America is usually seen as the big, wealthy uncle.

&gt; 
&gt; No, none of them do. Lying is not a good way to try to make a point.

I'm not lying, some Africans absolutely do:

&gt; There’s one more twist to the tale. In 2010 a research team – including Reich – published the first draft genome of a Neanderthal. Comparisons with living humans revealed traces of Neanderthal DNA in all humans with one notable exception: sub-Saharan peoples like the Yoruba and Khoisan.

&gt; That made sense. After early humans migrated out of Africa around 60,000 years ago, they bumped into Neanderthals somewhere in what is now the Middle East. Some got rather cosy with each other. As their descendants spread across the world to Europe, Asia and eventually the Americas, they spread bits of Neanderthal DNA along with their own genes. But because those descendants did not move back into Africa until historical times, most of this continent remained a Neanderthal DNA-free zone.

&gt; Or so it seemed at the time. Now it appears that the Back to Africa migration 3000 years ago carried a weak Neanderthal genetic signal deep into the homeland. Indeed one of Reich’s analyses, published last month, found Neanderthal traces in Yoruba DNA (Nature, DOI: 10.1038/nature12886).

Not even going to get into ""white"" and ""black"" Egyptians: That can be adequately explained by one group being slaves. Neat huh?

Same today, especially in America when it comes to race: People still tend to see themselves as being part of different communities, so there's not as much going on between them than inside them. But that's not a skin colour thing, just a general tribalism thing.

&gt;&gt; You aren't saying that Humans have a natural instinct to not breed with black people, but a different subspecies is a-ok, right?

Nice trolling, 8/8 m8. You say that white and black people don't want to interbreed because of natural instincts. I'm assuming to keep their genetics ""pure"", or something like that, because it doesn't sound like you are simply describing tribalism. That's why I brought up breeding with different subspecies of humans, because I'd like you to explain why white people have totally bred with non-Homo Sapiens quite a bit despite that instinct.

I'm not good at HTs in general. Never really learned all the tricks of the trade (I know the theory but make noob mistakes; overangle when sidescrapping, leave back sticking from behind obstacle, spend too long aiming, or too short and miss, etc.)  Also, I didn't spend gold on free-exp for a loooong time, using what I could save up to shorten stock grinds but usually falling way short. All that deep red you see is usually stock grinds. (only recently made the conversion of all that leftover XP; got lots of gold from christmas boxes, used the 1-35 discount after christmas).

I'll agree KV-3 was better. 10x? As stock, surely :) Top tier... nah. A little better. 

Also, I really hate DPG as measurement of performance. It's literally the worst of the performance indicators there are. It literally encourages bad gameplay and bad teamplay by concentrating on reducing HP pool of weakest targets and not even finishing them off. Spam gold, don't remove guns from battle - if your shot deals 850 HP, and there are 3 enemies, 15hp tier 9, 80hp tier X, 1000hp tier 8, which one will get the shell? Of course the pinata; and then retreat and go another flank, let the three wipe out competition to more HP! - and god forbid don't help teammates that could compete with you in damage farming.

For me, the good indicators are WR over longer periods (where randomness averages out but all untracked contributions to teamplay come out in the end); WN8 over shorter periods. I mean, I would sometimes actually go scouting in artillery at the end of the game when there was like 3 vs 2, or such. Surely staying and trying to get that last shot would increase my DPG (while sealing team loss).

Antes de chegar, principalmente por razões profissionais, eu fiz um curso intensivo de Português com três professoras brasileiras. Cada uma delas falou incessantemente da péssima situação de segurança neste país, de todas as mazelas e jabuticabas brasileiras que servem para atrasar o progresso e garantir o poder da elite. Da superioridade e facilidade da vida nos EUA. Parecia ser um passatempo do brasileiro, falar merda do seu próprio país. Bom, eu tenho que dizer a todos vocês que, comparado com a minha cidade natal nos Estados Unidos, a situação em São Paulo é basicamente a mesma. Tem crime e assalto sim, mas tomando precauções e medidas prudentes, é possível evitar ser vítima. Tem pobreza, muita pobreza. Na minha cidade tem bairros inteiros nos quais os prédios ficam abandonados mas ainda tem gente morando dentro. Façam um google search sobre St. Louis Abandoned Buildings. Bom, sei que tem muitos Brasis e que São Paulo não representa o país inteiro. Meu ponto é que os brasileiros muitas vezes exageram os defeitos do seu país. Criticar para promover um país melhor é bom. Criticar só para criticar não faz nada. Não digo que o Brasil é perfeito. A burocracia enlouquece. O processo de conseguir a instalação de internet na minha casa foi mais que chato. Os impostos nos produtos importados são ridículos. E polvilho, meu deus que coisa mais nojenta. (Sim, acho mesmo). Mas o Brasil, na sua essência, é especial e diferente. Eu conheço muitos países mas o Brasil o os brasileiros têm algo diferente que não posso neste momento identificar.

You aren't even right about there being a post-2004 surge once you include non-EU migration, even well-known [fullfact.org](https://fullfact.org/immigration/eu-migration-and-uk/) articles have debunked that.

The idea that wages suffered from the post-2004 EU worker increase has also been debunked - it's a deliberate conflation with the effects of the 2007 financial crisis. We can trivially see that after the post-2000 increase in non-EU migration [here](https://fullfact.org/media/uploads/EU_non_EU_net_migration.png) wage growth remained strong [until the 2007 financial crash](https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fftalphaville.ft.com%2Ffiles%2F2014%2F04%2FRealWagesChart-590x457.png?source=Alphaville).

If building homes hasn't matched the population growth in that period (IIRC it hasn't) then that's down to the government. I mean it's literally Tory policy to allow as much house price growth as possible because young people don't vote Tory.

Nope. If we had a higher birth rate all that would still happen because of our chronic underinvestment. Developed nations have low birth rate and a demographic imbalance so either have to become more productive (most developed nations) or grow the working population through immigration.

Nokhchiy,fylow,New User,"""It's hard to humanise a group of people whose religion wishes to take over"" So you're basically saying that you can't humanise Muslims? See again I wouldn't have any problem with that if we Muslims were all people spending our days believing that you're some kind of inferior human being who should be conquered throught force. You paint Islam is in such a simplistic way honestly. I don't think that the Muslims you've met want everybody to be Muslim through force or oppression, most Muslims I know wish everybody was Muslim so nobody would have to suffer from a punishment. My point isn't to show who is the ""most kind"" but to make you think that it might come from a benevolent feeling. 

""Because I can literally pull a plethora of negative statistics compared to positives more than any other group."" Funny because in most Western Europe statistics based on religion aren't even allowed, you might want to understand that we're not living Qurans and that just like anybody else we're different. So even if you can ""pull a plethora of negative statistics"" about Muslims why the hell does it gives you the right to stigmatize us? I was born and raised in the West, studied there and now I work there, pay my taxes just like your right ""conservatives"" comrades and I've never had problem with the police except when I maybe smoke a joint once in my life back in highschool, why the fuck would you say I'm part of those immigrants ""bringing the West down?""

""It's a risk to literally everyone who isn't Muslim."" ""Islam threatens liberty so it's critique won't be silenced over the way you feel."" So why are there plenty of non-Muslims who are living in nice conditions among Muslims? And who said I want the critics to be silenced because of how I feel? Just be honest, sometimes ""critics"" are nothing more than some obsessional bullshit warning about how ""Muslims are going to conquer us!!!!!"" while most of us don't give a f.

""Funny thing is, they are."" Are you even trying? The statistics that you pulled out aren't even about black people and it's only abou the US who have like a couple millions of Muslims among 300 millions of people. Do you have any statistics that shows if black Christians in Europe are more successful than black Muslims and ""bringing the West up""? It's no surprise though most conservatives magically thinks that if immigrants are Christians they're magically going to assimilate while Muslims absolutely won't even if in reality immigrants, whether Muslim or Christian, are gathered in ghettos and have both equal much chances to succeed or to fall in criminality.

&gt; Os depoimentos e documentos da delação premiada da empreiteira Odebrecht deixam sem explicação cerca de 600 codinomes de destinatários de propinas e repasses ilegais registrados nas planilhas do setor de operações ilícitas da construtora. A reportagem analisou nos últimos quatro meses cerca de 2.300 listas de pagamentos que fazem parte do acervo de 76 mil páginas apresentadas pela Odebrecht no âmbito da colaboração premiada assinada com o Ministério Público Federal. Além de subornos, as planilhas também contabilizavam transferências com recursos do caixa dois da empresa para quitar despesas como o pagamento de bônus por fora para alguns altos executivos da companhia, com sonegação de imposto, segundo Hilberto Mascarenhas, que chefiou o departamento ilegal de 2006 a 2014. Na delação da empreiteira fechada em dezembro de 2016, não há explicação para esse apelido, porém uma ex-funcionária do departamento de repasses ilegais vinculou o termo às iniciais do acionista e ex-número um do grupo, Emílio Alves Odebrecht.

ozzy-wbb,,,"I've created an AWS ec2 user data file that'll launch an Ubuntu instance, install the required VPN packages (libreswan, xl2tpd, etc), update all of the .confs, set password/keys, config iptables appropriately, etc.  I ran this on a t2.micro instance launched in a European or Brazil region, on the free tier, primarily to bypass local blackouts of my favorite sports team.  5 minutes before game time, I just spun up the instance in a region outside the US, updated the VPN gateway IP on my local Internet router's config, and I could essentially route all of that streaming traffic through AWS-based tunnel, while leaving everything else going out the local connection (quasi-split tunneling).  I'm running a Mikrotik router that has the capability to do destination-based routing over various interfaces inc IPSEC, so that helps.  It would be a lot easier to just force everything down the tunnel, but then you get into latency, throughput, and website-regional headaches.  Cost me $0 to run this for a year, and I could easily stream a 1080p quality stream over the VPN even with gateway located quite far away.

TLDR - Yes, you could definitely launch an AWS ec2 instance running the required VPN software of your choice, keep it on 24x7 (even for free for the first year of free tier if a t2.micro instance provide the throughput you require), leveraging that static IP as ""yours"".  Problems: you'd need a home router that can handle the VPN tunneling/routing, and you'd need to investigate the cloud providers network bandwidth charges to ensure you won't regret your actions ($).  I believe AWS is $0 for all inbound traffic from the Internet to ec2, and under the ec2 free tier, you get 15GB out for free, ~$0.10/GB after.  Given my limited use case, I never exceeded the outbound free bandwidth, but I suspect that'll likely be a problem for you... depending on your plan/needs.

Lorenzo_Insigne,s1 75 team-75 country-ita,Napoli,"&gt; Arsenal lost 10-2 to Bayern München, who WOULD HAVE knocked out Real and almost surely won the CL if not for refereeing shenanigans. Oh, and Koscielny. Imagine acting like Bayern aren't an amazing club; the team they have right now would still batter the best ever team Napoli had in its history. But hey, what history. Your have only one Serie A title in your history, and it's the one Maradona carried you to.

Where to even start? Imagine acting like Madrid weren't better than Bayern over the two legs, and a better overall team last season? I never said that Bayern aren't a fantastic team, that's just your deluded little brain making things up. And imagine not even having a European title to your name.

&gt; You do realise by saying you 'don't give a flying fuck about the CL' you are basically admitting you're a small club? If you can accept that, then we can move on.

Lol. This barely even merits a response. It's called prioritisation. I've never said we're a top top club, again that's just your delusion acting up, so unlike the very top clubs we have to focus on things we can actually win, like league titles for us, or cups for Arsenal.

&gt; And the point of bringing up the EL was to remind you that right now both Napoli and Arsenal are in the same European competition.

Not sure what your point is, one of them dropped down from the CL while one is there because they weren't good enough over the course of an entire season. And only one actually looks likely to be in it again next season.

&gt; You know what, I'll put a little 'remind me' to see which out of Dortmund, Napoli and Arsenal ended up going further in the EL. And I don't want no 'we didn't care' excuse either. If you tell me you 'don't care', you're basically conceding Arsenal are better than Napoli.

Lol holy *shit* you're stupid. Europa league is a small club competition. If the situations were reversed, you would 100% say that caring about it made Napoli a small club, but instead you say *not* caring about it makes them a small club?

Imagine acting like Madrid's goals were not offside. Bayern deserved to go through if the game was dictated accordingly. Plain and simple.

&gt; And imagine not even having a European title to your name.

This is funny. Napoli's only European title is a Europa League. But then, you go on and say:

&gt; Europa league is a small club competition.

Good job, Napoli, on winning a small club competition. :D

Oh, and I'd take getting to a CL final and losing, over a Europa League any fucking day of the week. Not only is one 50,000,000x more impressive than the other, but why do you think *so much more* prize money is earned? For fuck's sake, getting like 3 wins in the CL groups gives you more money than winning the Europa League. But holy shit, I can't believe you used your fucking Europa League as an argument. That's hilarious. Cute little Napoli, with two Serie A titles, five Coppa Italias and a UEFA cup in their entire history :D

&gt; It's called prioritisation. I've never said we're a top top club

Lol, playing strong teams in both competitions is not exclusive to top top teams.

&gt; Not sure what your point is, one of them dropped down from the CL while one is there because they weren't good enough over the course of an entire season. And only one actually looks likely to be in it again next season.

To this I'll just give the classic argument that PL &gt; Serie A. Imagine a league where the bottom clubs can't even get a single point for 13 fucking weeks.

&gt; Lol holy shit you're stupid. Europa league is a small club competition. If the situations were reversed, you would 100% say that caring about it made Napoli a small club, but instead you say not caring about it makes them a small club? 

First of all, you didn't even set a remind me. Looks like you already know who's getting further then.

Secondly, Arsenal don't care about it either, like Napoli. So the playing ground is even. Just pretend that both clubs care about it. And Arsenal's backup XI is dog shit, so no excuse there.

Devin_of_House_Maare,,,"Well, I’m not a full historian as of yet: I’m only a sixteen year old. But from all of my studies and research, the Hellenistic period, quite obviously, wouldn’t have influenced the cultures of the middle-east and the regions of India and Iran. Greek culture had spread as far as the Hydaspes due to Alexander’s campaigning, over a dozen cities had been founded throughout the old Persian empire, most of which had Greek influence as far as Baktria. An empire had crumbled, and new ways of life would emerge as Greek and local syncretism occurred, such as with the Macedonian Ptolemaic dynasty tilting themselves ‘pharaohs’ in Egypt. 

Philip II of Macedonia had practically established the modern Macedonian kingdom and united the Greek states (excluding Sparta) into the Hellenic League, a feat not ever accomplished by a single man. Philip had laid the foundation of the elite Macedonian army, which had been baptized in battle time and time again fighting campaigns against the Thracians, Illyrians, and neighboring Greeks. The men of the sarissa phalanx, unlike the foot soldiers of the other Greek monarchies and oligarchies, were full-time professionals. Lighter spearmen bolstered the Macedonian phalanx formations, allowing for further flexibility in Hellenic tactics and war doctrine. But the power of Philip’s army, the true strength of his already impressive war machine, was in his companion cavalry. Armed with long and sturdy lances, semi-armored mounts, and with discipline of steel, the companion cavalry, arguable, were the prologue and introduction to an age of warfare that was dominated by cavalry, even considered by some to be the predecessors of the iconic heavy horse formations of western high middle-age Europe. Such an unstoppable host would Philip create, along with his unquenched ambitions, would Alexander III inherit. 

I have no need to get into depth with the Hellenic king’s conquest, all that we need to focus on in this discussion are what resulted from these campaigns. Symbolically for the Macedonian people, their king had subdued the greatest empire to ever have existed, and broken the chains that hid the fortune of the eastern frontiers of Mesopotamia and Persia. Many people find it baffling when they learn that Alexander embraced the cultures of the easterners and the people that he conquered, but that is what he would have to do. For if anyone were to conquer such vast territories, and maintain any sort of long lasting empire, they may well have to embrace the customs of their conquered peoples to maintain a status-quo and effectively “win the peace.” Some of his generals well understood this, but the most nationalistic and prideful of his subordinates despised such a thought as degrading. But Alexander, despite all of his thoughts, sought to win the peace, and the example he set would be adopted by his successors until the Roman Republic’s conquests of the eastern provinces. Upon his death, the city that would become the greatest intellectual center in the known world, Alexandria (the one at the mouth of the Nile,) would be founded. Without his successes, Hellenic culture would not have such an influence on our world, especially not for so long. Not only this, but Alexander’s death would eventually create a power vacuum that would culminate in centuries of Diadochi wars between the descendants of the successors to his empire. Wars between the Seleucid Empire, Ptolemaic Egyptians, and Macedonians, would all leave the region fractured, divided, and under constant conflict. These Hellenic states’ infighting would eventually result in their annexation and subjugation by the Romans and resurgent Parthians. So without Alexander, a strong Persian empire, in theory, would continue to dominate the region, most likely even expand its influence beyond its borders. Also, the golden age of Greek culture (known as the Hellenic period) would have never began. So if Alexander were defeated at the Granicus, the world would be forever changed.

Lejeune_Dirichelet,,,"Because the EU (and it's predecessors) was born out of what the European belligerents of WW2 experienced. It was specifically intended to be a political supra-national organisation, meaning that it is supposed to have the ability to make it's own decisions and create policies for all it's members. This pooling of sovereignty, combined with a big emphasis on values such as human rights or democracy, should ensure that war becomes unthinkable and that such utter devastation never again happens in Europe. (Or at least that's the theory.)

Switzerland, however, is in a completely different mentality. It decided right from the start that economic cooperation with the rest of Europe was fine, but entering a political organisation was out of the question. And there are many reasons for that:

First, it hasn't experienced WW2's combat and destruction on it's own soil, so that societal ""baggage"" is kind of missing - on the contrary, WW2 reinforced the feeling that armed neutrality was the way to go for Switzerland, and nurtured a certain sense of paranoia towards the outside. Furthermore, since Switzerland ""fixed"" the problem of starting wars through self-imposed permanent neutrality, this whole business of warmongering appears a lot like a '*You* problem' to the Swiss. It would just be so much easier if everybody did the same, right?    

Second, Switzerland's intricate political culture is an absolutely central component of what makes Switzerland, Switzerland. There is no common underlying language, ethnicity or (to a certain extent) culture, but first and foremost the political will to make it all work. As such, binding it to a foreign entity is a sensitive and unwelcome topic.    
Not only that, but the Swiss political system (while ofc far from perfect) has also proven to be extraordinarily successful in running the country, providing stability, addressing social issues by way of consensus, securing the rule of law, or avoiding authoritarian drifts. Over the past half-century, it has also done a lot to ensure basic rights and democratic participation. As such, trust in Swiss institution is high and there is no feeling that Switzerland is lacking anything in that department - which contrasts with many of the young European democracies harbouring a dark dictatorial past, or European nations who regularly struggle with political difficulties; who often express the wish to have another ""layer"" of government supervise and reign in the excesses of their national administrations.    
In other words: Switzerland has found a way to work well, no foreign messing around with the established system is desired.

And contrary to what some poster below claim, preserving our wealth isn't a deciding factor in our choice to stay out of the EU. While economic concerns remain of course always of primordial importance when dealing with the EU; if anything, our prosperity has allowed us to focus more on the implications of joining a political supra-national organisation, and whether or not we are ready to accept the consequences. Whereas other wealthy western countries, such as Sweden or Denmark, joined the EU almost entirely for economic reasons, or Norway who was pressured into accepting pretty sad conditions.

kimb00,,,"&gt;""we're green"" for example. This means literally nothing and has no legal implications. A coal fired power plant with 0 filters or any effort to stem the tide of shit can advertise this way if they plant a fucking tree a year or some shit. It means nothing and businesses use this crap to get you on their side all the time.

While your post still carries weight, this is largely american thing. Many industries in Canada and Europe have regulatory bodies that monitor false advertising claims... and those bodies actually have the power to levy some pretty hefty fines (among other things). 

For instance:

* [Renewable Energy Certificates](https://www.greenalbertaenergy.ca/greencertification.html) are a real thing and are tracked (at least in Alberta) by a government agency that regularly monitors energy generators. 

* [Canada Organic](http://www.inspection.gc.ca/food/organic-products/eng/1300139461200/1300140373901) is a real thing with real rules and farmers are often audited by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.

Obviously that's not to say that advertising doesn't contain a shitload of weasel words and bullshit, but there are at least *some* standards.

Immigrants have been shown to have a positive effect on native wages.

Immigration may also [positively impact poor/unskilled native wages](https://academic.oup.com/jeea/article-abstract/10/1/152/2182016).

&gt; in the period from 1990 to 2006 immigration had a small effect on the wages of native workers with no high school degree (between 0.6% and +1.7%). It also had a small positive effect on average native wages (+0.6%)

[Here is another study (PDF)](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/110686/1/dp8961.pdf)

&gt; We find that an increase in the supply of refugee-country immigrants pushed less educated native workers (especially the young and low-tenured ones) to pursue less manual-intensive occupations. As a result immigration had positive effects on native unskilled wages, employment and occupational mobility.

[Another](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecoj.12077/full)

&gt;We find that immigration had a positive effect on the wages of less educated natives and it increased or left unchanged the average native wages.

Syriancivilwar6,zahleflair,Kahraba 24/24,"Hezbollah cooperated with some European countries over information related to terrorism, the party’s Secretary-General Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah said Wednesday, announcing that the current U.S. administration had tried to communicate with the party ahead of the inauguration. Nasrallah also said that the axis of the resistance should prepare and be ready for any future war with Israel in the region.

“There is cooperation with European intelligence agencies,” Nasrallah said in an interview with Pan Arab TV channel Al-Mayadeen. He said that cooperation focused on the fight against Daesh (ISIS), telling Sami Kleib, the host of the Luabat Al Umam TV show, that the party didn’t mind intelligence cooperation to protect other people.

Nasrallah refused to disclose any information about which countries they had cooperated with.

The Europeans weren’t the only ones that sought cooperation with Hezbollah, Nasrallah said. He noted that the multiple U.S. administrations had also done so.

“I don’t think the Trump administration made any offers [recently],” he said, referring to U.S. President Donald Trump. “The last American attempt to communicate with us was after he was elected, but he had yet to take office [on Jan. 21, 2017].”

Nevertheless, Nasrallah touched on previous offers put forward during the administration of George Bush and his Vice President Dick Cheney.

Nasrallah said a person of Lebanese origins with an American passport “provided me with an offer in return for certain commitments.” “It came through Cheney,” he added.

He said the offer came in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that was carried out by Al-Qaeda.

The offer from the Bush administration reportedly said Hezbollah would be removed from the terrorist list, the party’s detainees would be released, and U.S. opposition on Hezbollah’s participation in the Lebanese government would be lifted.

The Americans, he said, also offered to remove restrictions on Hezbollah as well as opening diplomatic channels with them.

“They also presented to give us $2 billion and said we can keep our weapons, except for Katyusha weapons,” Nasrallah told Kleib.

In return for this offer, Hezbollah was asked to offer certain commitments, he explained, including that “the weapons can’t be used against Israel. We were allowed to keep them, but not use them against Israel.

“We were asked not to provide any support, training or weapons to the Palestinians, be it through sharing experiences, weapons or training as well as cooperating [with the U.S.] on the Al-Qaeda issue.

Nasrallah added that Hezbollah had declined Bush’s offer. Barrack Obama’s administration, via – he said – U.S. intelligence agencies, tried to contact the party through intermediaries, but these also failed.

With Trump’s recent move to recognize occupied Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s support of this move, Nasrallah said these actions required the axis of the resistance to remain on alert for any future war.

“The axis of the resistance’s project isn’t a war but a resistance,” he said. “But the new thing is that Trump and Netanyahu [with their decisions] might be forcing the region to head toward war. I am not saying that there will be one, [but] that there might be a war.”

This will happen through a war on Gaza, Lebanon or even a war on Syria because of what he said was the failure of the project prepared for the country. “The axis of the resistance should prepare for this war and turn this threat into an opportunity.”

Nasrallah declined to discuss preparations for any future conflict but said Hezbollah would use the element of surprise. “The resistance is working day and night to get all kinds of arms that will allow it to rise victorious in any [future war],” he said, adding that Hezbollah has surprises and modern arms. “The resistance in Lebanon is stronger than ever.”

But Nasrallah pointed out that there was a difference between preparing for a war and respecting the rules of engagement.

When asked about the criticism directed at the party for not responding to Israeli strikes against Hezbollah in Syria, Nasrallah replied: “Not answering the Israeli strikes is based on the rules of engagement and we will respond at the right time.”

He said the strikes sometimes achieved their aim and sometimes they didn’t. “The strikes didn’t and will not prevent the access of arms to the resistance and they know that.”

Honestly we probably need more clubs and academies then *European* sports wisdom would normally expect. Like you said, we're a country the size of Europe with a population the size of England/Spain/Italy/France/Germany combined. 

I mean think about it like this - there's over 70 cities in this country with a population of over 500,000, and that's from a nearly 20 year old census. 70+ cities have over half a million people. If you step outside of the view of ""business metrics,"" that's 70+ cities that could support real ""D1"" soccer in this country, or at the very least ""D2,"" however we end up defining them.  

We've talked about this in the USL subreddit before when people balk at the ""crazy"" expansion of the league towards 40 teams, but really, why stop at 30 teams? or 40 teams? or even 50 teams? At some point one of these leagues is going to realize that the expansion really doesn't have to stop and they're leaving a ton of money on the table by locking out cities that want to have D1 soccer.

If you live in North America, this is the most common type of lock that you will encounter. The only reason a pin-tumbler pick will not be able to pick a pin-tumbler lock is if it is too large or small, too thick, or if there are extra security features in the lock designed to make picking more difficult.

There’s more than one type of lock, though, and especially in Europe there are designs such as the [disc detainer](http://lockwiki.com/index.php/Disc_detainer), [tubular](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubular_pin_tumbler_lock), [lever](http://lockwiki.com/index.php/Lever), and [dimple](http://lockwiki.com/index.php/Dimple) lock which for the most part aren’t compatible with pin-tumbler picks and require special tools.

However, since pin-tumbler locks are still the vast majority of locks in use today, as a beginner you don’t need to worry about getting tools for other types of locks just yet. You can get far into this hobby before needing to explore more exotic lock designs.

WikiTextBot,,,"**LC circuit**

An LC circuit, also called a resonant circuit, tank circuit, or tuned circuit, is an electric circuit consisting of an inductor, represented by the letter L, and a capacitor, represented by the letter C, connected together. The circuit can act as an electrical resonator, an electrical analogue of a tuning fork, storing energy oscillating at the circuit's resonant frequency.

LC circuits are used either for generating signals at a particular frequency, or picking out a signal at a particular frequency from a more complex signal; this function is called a bandpass filter. They are key components in many electronic devices, particularly radio equipment, used in circuits such as oscillators, filters, tuners and frequency mixers.

**Foxhole radio**

A foxhole radio is a makeshift radio that was first used by soldiers in World War II, specifically at Anzio, spreading later across the European and Pacific theaters. There were different versions of the foxhole radio; all used a safety razor blade as a radio wave detector. The ""classic"" foxhole radio was configured like a crystal radio, with the blade acting as the crystal and a wire, safety pin, or, later, a pencil serving as the cat's whisker.

dMegasujet,,,"Let me give you one last chance here. Please do try to read everything before you go ""aha!"" in the middle of it and write some fucking nonsense again.

T_D openly states they will ban you if you are not a Trump supporter. This is not a loosely defined rule. It's extremely precise. You will get banned if you disagree with them about Trump. This is official and clearly visible in the sidebar. The T_D mod team is very transparent about this. If your opinion is seen as incorrect by the mods of T_D, you will be banned. They are open about the fact that you will get banned. They will quote their extremely transparent and precise rules as a reason for your ban.

Europe and politics do not state they will ban you if you are not a leftist/Democrat supporter. There are no rules that forbid you from posting political opinions that the mods see as incorrect. However, in practice, the mods will sometimes ban you for posting opinions that they see as incorrect. Since there are no rules about posting ""incorrect"" opinions, they will instead claim to ban you because of their more general rules. In practice they will also not apply these same rules to people who are posting ""correct"" opinions, even if the ""correct"" comment is otherwise very similar to an ""incorrect"", banned comment. They will quote their general, selectively applied rules as a reason for your ban, because they do not officially admit to any political motivation behind their moderation. This is the issue I brought up in my original post here and continued to bring up in every single post you failed to understand. This is clearly different from the behavior of T_D mods, and could only be equalized if mods of europe and politics admitted that certain ""incorrect"" views are not allowed. 

You may disagree with me about the whole premise (as in, you could say the mods of europe do not do this and the bans in question were truthfully applied because of the impartial, official rules of /r/europe, and not because it was selectively applied due to political opinions) but you do not get to say I'm contradicting myself at any point.

Firstly Asians are not the only ones to be mocked by American media. Latinos, blacks, hell even white Europeans do too. Don't anyone here remember the freedom fries incident?Hell even white Americans don't get a pass with all the mocking stereotypes of Texans and white southerners, etc.

Secondly I'm amazed you mentioned Indian gurus since I already made another post about this subreddit and the internet neglecting the issues South Asians (esp middle class Indians) suffer. Why don't you post there?

I don't know much about Logan Paul specifically but there are Americans who mock the Holcoaust (and don't forget freedom fries). While we're at it how come we're ignoring what the Hispanics face? Which on a day-to-day basis is far worse and much more frequent than everything Asian racists do.

There are more incidents of disrespect towards the dead related to Mexican than the Paul Logan incident. But none of that gets any notice here.

Besides it seems like Paul Logan is a jerk from the google search I just did. And he already made an apology recently. It seems in Youtube he's just the type of buffoon who enjoys pulling BS (not to mention he was visiting the country at a time so what better way to do a buffoon stunt than when you're in another place).

I mean what about the mockery Asian Muslims such as Indonesians face? I don't see anyone here complaining about the negative stereotypes about Indonesians?

And the Otaku stereotype is serious enough that even Japanese society has made commentaries about how its a sign of societal backwards. Its just so spread on the internet its the easiest attack to use on Japan (especially in debates with Weaboos about WWII).

EDIT

I was right, Logan Paul is thae type of buffoon who does stuff like this.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/6f2f087137764c8a905d2eb0e5478296.png)  

&gt; Early life and studies
André Rieu was born into a musical family on October 1, 1949 in Maastricht in the Netherlands. He began studying violin at the age of five. His father was a conductor. From a very young age he developed a fascination with orchestra. He studied violin at the Conservatoire Royal in Liège and in the Conservatorium Maastricht, (1968–1973). His teachers included Jo Juda and Herman Krebbers. From 1974 to 1977, he attended the Music Academy in Brussels, studying with André Gertler, winning the Premier Prix at the academy.

&gt; 
[edit] Career
At University he performed the Gold And Silver Waltz by Franz Lehár. Encouraged by the audience reaction he decided to pursue the waltz form. Rieu formed the Maastricht Salon Orchestra and performed as a violinist with the Limburg Symphony Orchestra. In 1987, he created the Johann Strauss Orchestra and his own production company. Since then, his melodramatic stage performances and rock-star demeanor have for some been associated with a revival of the waltz music category. André Rieu plays a 1667 Stradivarius violin.[1]

&gt; In April 2009 (Australia) /June 2009 (UK), he made a cameo appearance as himself on ""Ramsay Street"" in the long-running Australian soap opera Neighbours.

&gt; 
[edit] Johann Strauss Orchestra
The Orchestra began in 1987 with 12 members but now performs with between 40 and 50 musicians. At the time the Orchestra first toured Europe, there emerged a renewed interest in waltz music. The revival began in the Netherlands and was ignited by their recording of the Second Waltz from Shostakovich's Jazz Suites. As a result, Rieu became known as the waltz King.

&gt; Rieu and his orchestra have performed throughout Europe, in North America, and Japan. Winning a number of awards including two World Music Awards, their recordings have gone gold and platinum in many countries, including 8-times Platinum in the Netherlands. In September 2007 Rieu performed in Australia for the first time solo, without his Orchestra at the Eastland shopping centre in the Melbourne suburb of Ringwood playing ""My Way"" and ""Waltzing Matilda""—and the next day appeared at Sydney’s Arena Cove, Warringah Mall shopping complex with the same set. Rieu and orchestra returned to Australia in November as part of his world tour. Rieu and his orchestra played 3 concerts at Melbourne's Telstra Dome from 13-15 November and continued their tour throughout Perth, Sydney, Brisbane and Adelaide, through to December 2008. The concert theme is 'A Romantic Vienna Night' and the set comprises a replica of part of a Viennese castle, complete with 2 ice-skating rinks 2 Fountains, and a ballroom dance floor situated above and behind the Orchestra. Rieu's largest concert attendance to date in Australia was 38,000 on Saturday 15th November in Melbourne. The Perth concert did not feature the replica of the Viennese Palace as it was stated in the press because it would not fit into the front doors of Subiaco Oval.

&gt; He records both DVD and CD repertoire at his own recording studios in Maastricht in a wide range of classical music as well as popular and folk music plus music from well-known sound tracks and theatre musicals. His lively orchestral presentations, in tandem with incessant marketing, have attracted worldwide audiences to this subgenre of classical music.

&gt; Some of his orchestra's performances have been broadcast in the United Kingdom and the United States on the PBS television network[2] such as the 2003 airing of Andre Rieu Live in Dublin, filmed in Dublin, Ireland, and 2005’s André Rieu Live in Tuscany filmed in the Piazza Della Repubblica in the village of Cortona in Tuscany.

&gt; 
[edit] Criticism
The artistic director of the Australian Chamber Orchestra, Richard Tognetti, has called Rieu's music Schlagermusik, among other things.[3]

&gt; Eamon Kelly writing in The Australian newspaper, in an article that discusses the controversy that Rieu engenders, said: ""He depicts his critics as members of a stuffy musical elite with narrow aesthetic tastes, yet regularly demeans in interviews music that is not to his taste and classical musicians who choose not to perform in his manner.""[4]

&gt; 
[edit] Personal life
He is married to Marjorie, who works with him full-time as production manager, and has two sons, Marc and Pierre. He speaks (in order of fluency) Dutch (including his home/city dialect Maastrichtian), English, German, French, Italian and Spanish.[citation needed] Rieu has worked with his brother, Jean Philippe for several years, but Jean Philippe has now started his own production company

The Shope papilloma virus (SPV), also known as cottontail rabbit papilloma virus (CRPV) or Kappapapillomavirus 2, is a papillomavirus which infects certain leporids, causing keratinous carcinomas resembling horns, typically on or near the animal’s head. The carcinomas can metastasize or become large enough to interfere with the host’s ability to eat, causing starvation. Richard E. Shope investigated the horns and discovered the virus in 1933, an important breakthrough in the study of papillomaviruses and neoplasia. The virus was originally discovered in cottontail rabbits in the Midwestern U.S., but can also infect brush rabbits, black-tailed jackrabbits, snowshoe hares, and European rabbits.

On the job training is critical, it is the absolute backbone of any trade, but it is also the place that most people learn how to do things improperly.  
Working in the real world sometimes requires short cuts that just work.  That doesn't mean that they are the right way to do things though.

Accredited schools will teach a curriculum that includes industry wide standardized practices, based upon the prevailing codes of the industry; API, AWS, ASME, CSA or ISO/EU or whichever it happens to be.

I started out calling these ""Kik for later+"", because they share some similarities, but ""Adult VideoBooks"" or ""Erotic stories brought to life"" serves it better. They are created by using a sexy written erotic story combined with pictures and videos of me living the life of Emma. It is quite unique and different from a normal kik session. These VideoBooks are the result of a joined effort between Sienna Rose, a friend/erotica writer, and myself ('actress' of the movies and pictures)

&amp;nbsp;

#### **But what is it?**

* A personalised *(using your first name)* erotic story (written), featuring myself (Emma), you and sometimes some other characters, combined with pictures and videos that match the story, bringing it to life

* The text and pictures will be delivered in an order so that you can read a bit of text, look at a matching picture, read a bit more, look at a matching video, etc. You will be able to re-use the VideoBook at a later time to enjoy it again as often as you like.

* But since this is quite a new concept, **[here's a preview!](http://0djmfskjfdqsmldjflmsjdf.blogspot.be/2017/12/emma-smiled-happily-as-she-closed.html)** If you like what you read and see here, you're gonna love the stories!

&amp;nbsp;

## **Current stories**

#### **1. Emma's escort agency experience [$25]**

* Emma has been divorced for 9 months after being married for 10+ years and never experienced an orgasm. A friend convinces her to use an escort agency to change that. The things she experiences, she never thought possible...

* ~ 30 mins worth of content; 7 pics &amp; 11 vids (~ 3 minutes of video)

&amp;nbsp;

#### **2. Emma gets mind controlled and turned into a sex slave [$28]**

* Emma realizes the world has a lot to show her that she has never opened herself up to see. She needs this to change, and (wrongfully?) trusts the first person offering to show her a whole new world. She gets strung along, mind controlled and eventually turned into a sex slave...

* ~ 30 mins worth of content; 6 pics &amp; 12 vids (~ 7 minutes of video)

&amp;nbsp;

#### **3. Emma's husband finally returns home from prison [$30]**

* Emma's husband is released from prison after being wrongfully convicted. She is ready for him, waiting at home, with just an apron and heels on ... But is he ready for her?

decimatejking,,,"#1 Manchester City 
The Premier League leaders take the top spot in Soccerex's list. The immense wealth of City's owners and value of their first-team squad boost their overall assets, while there is minimal debt on the books thanks to massive investment from the club's Emirati owners. 

#2 Arsenal 
The Gunners' position may come as a surprise to some. But careful management of the club's assets mean there is plenty of cash in the bank and minimal debt, while still boasting one of the best squads in the game. 

#3 Paris Saint-Germain 
Arguably the richest club on the planet in cash terms, as demonstrated by the signings of Neymar and Kylian Mbappe over the summer. But the low value of Parc des Princes and relatively high debt levels keep PSG off the summit for Soccerex. 

#4 Guangzhou Evergrande 
The Chinese club are owned by two of the world's wealthiest enterprises, Evergrande and Ali Baba, a fact which accounts for the vast majority of their wealth. No club, not even PSG, can match Guangzhou in terms of potential investment from those in charge. 

#5 Tottenham 
The north Londoners join neighbours Arsenal in making the top five. The promise of a new stadium and a heavily valued playing squad push Spurs into a surprisingly high placing, while there is plenty of cash in the bank. 

#6 Real Madrid 
As a club owned by its members, Real Madrid score zero in the potential investment stakes, an anomaly that drags down the score of what would otherwise be the most valuable football institution on the planet. No other side can match the Merengue in terms of player value.  

#7 Manchester United 
The highest debt levels of any side in this top 30 drag United down overall. But as the signings of stars like Paul Pogba and Romelu Lukaku in recent seasons have demonstrated, few clubs can match the Red Devils in terms of pure spending. 

#8 Juventus 
One of only two teams from Italy to make the top 30 of Soccerex's list. The financial might of the Agnelli family means plenty of investment can be expected, while stars like Paulo Dybala and Miralem Pjanic ensure their squad is among Europe's most valuable. 

#9 Chelsea 
Doubtlessly one of the richest clubs around, the Blues are hamstringed in Soccerex's rankings by the unique manner in which they are financed by owner Roman Abramovich. The Russian funnels money into the side by way of timeless loans, which nevertheless technically count as debt - of all the top 30 Chelsea are by far the team furthest 'into the red', at least on paper. 

#10 Bayern Munich 
Despite the lack of a wealthy investor, the Bavarians' financial muscle is legendary. Unbroken success locally mean Bayern easily outstrip their closest rivals both on and off the field.

PortAltepa,,,"I think equating a condemnation of ""approaching"" women randomly and ""all stranger interactions"" is a slippery slope fallacy at best. You can have interactions with a stranger without effectively predatory intent, nobody gives a shit about that, but we're not talking about everyday interactions - context matters, and I'm, at least, talking about this society-envenoming snake oil that's peddled to dudes that says that they should go up and start approaching randoms all over the place with an abundance mentality until they finally meet someone who is amenable to that ""approach"". It turns out that inventing the sport of yes, _accosting_, women in public for dates and evangelizing it as a numbers game might get you someone who reciprocates eventually, but, in the process you've remorselessly bothered a whole lot of people who didn't deserve it to get there, which is not only morally wrong but a tragedy of the commons. But going further down that thought thread gets us chest deep into a debate about PUA shit, and nobody who has an opinion about PUA stuff ever has had their mind changed with an internet comment. 

So, instead, I want to talk about a Reddit meetup I was at a couple of years ago at a park. 

--------------------

I don't think it's actually that much of a stretch for most people to imagine what a Reddit meetup is like. There are some cool people, some nerdy people, lots of dudes, not as many chicks but still some, some people throwing around a frisbee, others just chatting or playing board games, or what have you. Mostly college or grad students, people in their early-to-mid 20s. 

Most people? Super friendly. A bit intense, like trying to sound friendly and use an indoor voice through a megaphone, but by no means bad people. I had some fun eating some picnic food (most people brought some chips or crudite or dip), tossing around said frisbee and talking to some people about their experiences in school or at their first jobs or about where they grew up. There were a bunch of awkward guys there clearly there to meet nerdy girls, but none of them were as much of a poster child of what NOT to do to women than, to preserve anonymity, a person I will call ButtyShitty42.

ButtyShitty42 was a six foot two inch tall graduate student in a STEM field - and I mention his height just to be clear that this guy was by no means conventionally unattractive. I'm not going to say he was conventionally attractive either, (he wasn't), but he had some things going for him - things that, as you'll see, were not his personality. 

ButtyShitty42 liked approaching women Redditors at the meetup. He came across as nice, introduced himself, asked about the other women, their lives, expressed interest in their likes and dislikes, and so forth. But - as was evident to every single woman at the meetup - and some of the more alert men - ButtyShitty42 had a problem with boundaries. 

He would try to touch women in ostensibly the most casual way possible - at first. Maybe casually extending his hand and brushing theirs while emphasizing something he was saying. Sometimes he'd throw his head back in laughter and try to casually touch their shoulders or the small of their back. Back in the day, we'd call this the ""kino escalation ladder"" (I promised I'd stay away from the PUA stuff, but here I am), which was billed as a method to establish and escalate physical comfort with a woman. Only - it was so obvious. It was so uncomfortable. People did not want to be touched - did not appreciate this steady escalation and textbook tone-deafness to other people's space. This nice, sociable, friendly guy creeped everyone out despite his apparent niceness, sociability and friendliness. 

Touching people was only scratching the surface, though. This guy wasn't just content with casual touches; he believed in dominating conversations. And no, I don't mean being a loudmouth or continuously talking about things nobody cared about - I mean he would attempt to gradually physically block out anyone else in a conversation other than the girl he was interested in. You'd be in a circle with 4-5 people talking about something silly, like the Great Wall of China. Step. He'd close the circle, just slightly, and you'd think it was weird, but you'd still be talking about Mulan. Step. All of a sudden, you'd just see the back half of the side of his face, while you were trying to get a word edgewise about how weird it was that Mushu was voiced by Eddie Murphy. And so on, until he'd closed the circle until it was him facing his ""target"", the last remnants of a circle of people who were both trying to be polite and didn't have the self-confidence to speak up and confront the guy. We were, after all, young and Redditors.

There were multiple flubs on his part - attempts at executing a technique that he might have read about, hoping they'd start some sort of spark with a woman at the meetup, but nothing really topped the coup d'grace of his afternoon - ""demonstrating"" how people greet each other in Europe by attempting to kiss one of the women he'd been touching and cornering in conversations on the cheek. Holy fuck. So creepy. When he left, everyone breathed a sigh of relief and started talking about just how violated they felt just being in his presence. The girl was visibly disgusted, but, to her credit, took the whole thing in stride and later remarked - ""I guess I should have expected that at a Reddit meetup"", but I've never forgiven myself for not stepping in and intervening and vocally telling this guy to knock it off. I unfriended this girl on Facebook - because I honestly could not bear the guilt of not doing something and being a bystander to harassment. Evil triumphs when good people do nothing, and all that. 

Here's the thing about ButtyShitty42 though - I doubt he had a single cell in his body that actually wanted to hurt any of us or make us uncomfortable. He was simply following a formula, a map of techniques that maybe he'd picked up on what /r/seduction used to be or from his buddies about the secrets to getting women. Just following orders. But his naivety made a whole lot of people feel like total shit that day - and I doubt that many of those women came back to further Reddit meetups thanks to his ""casual"" approaches. He made their lives - actually, all of our lives - worse whilst ""just being nice"" - just, as you say, meeting strangers out living life. 

So, look, you _personally_ might not intend anything by chatting up the attractive stranger at the gym, and there's context for everything, context you learn as you mature and grow older and hopefully more become sensitive to other people (actually, most people don't do this, but whatever). But for the entirety of human history and the entirety of human existence there will be a gap between a human's understanding of their own intentions and the actual impact of their actions. That's okay because it's hard to actually assess that. That includes the Redditor above's failed attempt at finding a date. You live and learn - and I can say with absolute certainty that I've played the role of ButtyShitty42 in many other people's stories. 

Not every dude is as bad as ButtyShitty42, who really deserves an anti-award for that performance.

But. In the context of a woman dealing with a lifetime of ButtyShitty42s, the typical dude's kindasorta casual approach but still with the intent of getting with the person they're trying to come off to as an innocuous Chatty Cathy is about as useful as a chemical plant dumping its toxic waste into a river and claiming the water is drinkable. It's fucking annoying and obvious, and we should stop selling dudes on this idea that it's the right way to go about things.

WordSalad11,,Markham,"&gt; That's a survey study, not an actual study. 

It's exactly the same study design as the study you cited, with two important differences:

1. The European study used blood levels to determine actual tobacco exposure. Your study used a singe survey in 1960 as a proxy.

2. It's not from 1960. People in 1960 smoked in their homes, but also their offices, cars, grocery stores, and all over the place. Use of married to a smoker vs. non-smoker is a weak proxy for second hand smoke exposure. Results from 20 years ago do not apply to today.

This is fairly accurate if you compare the USA to Europe, or at least the Netherlands. 

You had to fight for your independence from a government, while we (Europeans) had to fight wealthy industrials who abused the hell out of option-less labourers. Social and economic mobility was very limited in 19th century Europe, unless you moved to America ('the land of opportunity'). We didn't have large swaths of land available for anyone willing to work, we had large masses of poor folk chained to debt. Living in squalor forced to work for (insufficient) pay.

Our population got out of this 'debt bondage' by getting our governments to enforce labour rights, workplace protections, housing regulations, public education etc..

It's very easy to label them as criminals and beggars, but I honestly think that our governments have failed them. With no proper social net and help a big part of the community lives on the streets, begs and does whatever they need to to get money. Also, from a very young age people are almost conditioned to be racist towards them. Because of divisive politics and many people having a negative experience with a beggar or a thief the rest of the population tends to think of them as less on a whole. Which is terrible because even families that are trying really hard to fit in and to get an education, a job and just live will be victims of abuse and racism. Even the kids. Especially the kids. In my opinion we need to do a lot more in Eastern Europe to stop the systematic abuse of children that goes on in the communities, stop the begging, offer real help and put a stop to everyday racism towards them.

The Paxter is limited to 45km/h, the Twizy either 80 or 45km/h, this suggests they are not appropriate for 100km/h roads. Think of the issues associated with camper vans travelling at 80, now compound this by making them less visible and with lower safety specs. Crumple zones don't just protect the occupants of a vehicle, they also protect what it hits. A car hitting a mostly ridgid object (like a modern micro-car) has to dissipate more energy through its crumple zones, increasing the chance of intrusion into the passenger compartment. It's part of the reason we don't allow non crash-tested bullbars on modern (post 2003) vehicles.

The EU classes the 45km/h limited electrics as three wheel mopeds, the 80km/h models as motor tricycles. If we adopted this classification scheme the former would be banned from motorways (as a moped) and the later would be grouped with 601cc+ motorbikes (with the associated costs).

WikiTextBot,,,"**Intermarium**

Międzymorze (Polish pronunciation: [mʲɛnd͡zɨˈmɔʐɛ]), known in English as Intermarium, was a plan pursued after World War I by Polish leader Józef Piłsudski for a federation of Central and Eastern European countries. Invited to join the proposed federation were the Baltic states (Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia), Finland, Belarus, Ukraine, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia.

The Polish name Międzymorze (from między = ""between"" or ""among""; + morze = ""sea""), meaning ""Between-seas"", was rendered into Latin as ""Intermarium.""

The proposed federation was meant to emulate the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, stretching from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea, that, from the end of the 16th century to the end of the 18th, had united the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

Intermarium complemented Piłsudski's other geopolitical vision—Prometheism, whose goal was the dismemberment of the Russian Empire and that Empire's divestment of its territorial acquisitions.

chromesto,,,"EU SC here. I've always played my sorcs as pure Fire or Frozen Orb sorcs so I've never had a Blizzard one until this season. So far the ladder has been amazing for me. I'll write a short summary of my progress so far.

I was bit slow to start since originally I was supposed to play with a group of friends so I made an enchantress. Slowly I reached end of hell and figured out that 2 of the friends were too busy with other games. I still didn't want to respec her so I made a new sorc with the idea of finally giving Blizzard a proper try.

It was pretty smooth to reach a point where I was able to farm Hell Ancient Tunnels. In my **second** run a golden diadem happened. A pretty good roll of -20/+13 as well. I decided that I'll be aiming towards having a complete Lightning sorceress with Infinity and all the good stuff. I've never had one of those after all. A good Griffon's seemed to make it possible!

My luck did not run dry that fast. I was picking some cool stuff left and right. Got a 35fcr Spirit in a crystal sword. Managed to gather all the runes up to Gul rune. Gul was from hellforge and rest from whatever sources. When I was waiting for someone to teleport to Baal I killed few things in the Lost City and scored an Ohm rune.

Already quite lucky but that is not all of it. I did not even have desires to have a CTA this soon in the ladder but since I had all the runes at hand I decided to go for it. It is a scratching ticket so I was prepared for the worst. When I put the final rune in it ended up rolling +5 to Battle Command and +6 to Battle Orders! Battle Cry was just 1 but who cares.

Few days later the council members near Meph gave me a pleasant surprise with another Ohm rune! I wasn't exactly sure what to do with it but eventually I traded it for Vex+2Ists so I could make a HOTO. What roll did I get? Just a perfect 40 all resistances!

When it comes to magic finding I've had some luck too. To begin with I've gotten Raven Frost (18 dex iirc), Gorerider, Heaven's Light (2 pala, 2os) and Herald of Zakarum which is great since I want to have torches so I need a smiter paladin. Now my smiter is almost complete for some cheap ghetto style runs with a Life Tap wand. I could always just trade for a pair of Dracul's and Guillaume's Face if I don't get them to drop until I start running Tristram.

When it comes to other good uniques I did get a nice 35 all resistances Skin of the Vipermagi. MDR roll was rather low but a 35 all resistances is great enough. I also picked up a level up version of -5/5 fire facet from Meph. Not as great as a die version would be but it still should go for something nice if I manage to find someone who wants to buy it. I don't think there has been much other interesting stuff dropping besides...

Pindleskin was nice enough to bless me with another unique Diadem! -19/13 is a decent roll too. So 2 without 3rd? Nope. When I was baaling with my friend in a private game I saw a third unique diadem to drop. I let him have it since I already had 2. I can't remember the exact roll but it was a mediocre roll iirc. Still a nice piece of equipment.

So in short I've had really good luck with my finds and runewords. My sorceress will likely hit 92 today or tomorrow. My gear is a mixed bag of some cheap (=worthless) random items and some really awesome stuff. Basically I already have:

Dukenukem117,,,"I wanted to do the math on this out of curiosity:

According to steamspy, there are about 459k purchases. Most were at $20, but the last 80k were at $15.

So $7,580,000 + 1,200,000 = $8,780,000

But wait! Steam takes 30%! Those crooks! And credit card companies usually charge 3%, maybe more if the currency has to convert from USD to EURO.

Now its $5,882,600

According to linkedin, they have 11 employees at least, since not everyone is on linkedin.

According to their website, they work on one thing at a time and try to do things that can be done under 1 years. Except their last release was in August 2015, and they canceled a project before they started working on Northgard. But that's still 2.5 years of pay to cover up until this point - for 11 people - in France.

Now usually a company is paying twice as much as one's salary to have that person once you factor in all the other costs.

So $5,882,600 / (11 people x 2.5 years x 2) = $106,956 per year on average.

Thats obviously not bad for an indie, but this is also assuming they didn't have any debt from their first game which only had mixed or average reviews. It's also assuming they don't have any investors who are looking to collect their cut. Average devs in the USD can expect to make 80-100k working for a big studio, so this isn't ludicrous money. 

They did sell 100,000 units in the last 3 months, but about 80,000 units were at $15. So that's $1,072,000 after steam and visa fees, or 4,288,000 a year. With 11 employees, that still comes out to be about $195,000 per employee - which is obviously pretty good - but not mind-blowing. But can they keep this up?

Their average units per month is 45,900, except the last 3 is about 33,000 - meaning its declining. They've had a good spike since cutting the price to $15, but this is also during Christmas, at the height of gift giving and game buying. 

I'm obviously making a ton of assumptions here, but it looks like Northgard is quite success - for an indie game. I also completely ignored taxes, which EU isn't known for being low on. But whatever extra cash this makes also has to cover a the possible 2 years before their next game. 

All things considered, it's not a slam dunk case that they can afford more developers.

Stoicismus,haydn,,"&gt; wow, this music is super complicated,

his church music is quite easy listening nonetheless

&gt; do you want to tell me that some random people got to church and listened every time to two hours worth of this mind blowing music? 

no, daily functions didn't last so long. Many people were also not paying attention.

&gt; how didn't they kick him out and hired someone who can write music that ordinary people can listen and enjoy for the first time?

other composers would write similar music. Church style was quite fixed.

Anyway

&gt; Given their widespread tardiness and the variety of activities and distractions fac-
ing them, how attentively did congregations listen to the music of Bach,
Kuhnau, and others? How much of the often complex music and its religious
symbolism did they understand?
Since the place of the cantata in the liturgy was just before and after the ser-
mon, people were coming and going while it was being performed. Given this,
and that people conversed with their neighbors, there was a certain level of
background noise throughout performances. Further, while it seems that sound
projected well from the musicians’ balconies, and the acoustic of the churches
was well suited for music to be heard, 30 vocal and instrumental forces were quite
small. The bulk of most cantatas for regular Sundays featured only one solo
voice at a time. The number of instruments playing was also small, although
vocal and instrumental forces were increased on holidays and other special
occasions.
Measured by present-day standards of punctuality and silence during protest-
ant services, and of regulated applause during concerts of classical music, Bach
and his predecessors received less than perfect attention during their perform-
ances. However, these standards developed later, and to judge eighteenth-
century audiences by modern concert-hall paradigms is to misunderstand them.
The expectation that an audience should arrive before the start of a perform-
ance, be seated, quiet, and otherwise disciplined was not yet the norm.
Historians have begun to discover that, during the eighteenth century in secu-
lar concerts and opera houses throughout Europe, it was common practice for
audiences to arrive late, wander about, and converse during performances. In
secular contexts approval might be expressed by applauding individual arias or

MrSabuhudo,,,"&gt; Because Comcast loses customers when they provide shitty services. That's a real world example completely nullifying this argument.

With Comcast, we have the problem of natural monopoly. Which means that because fixed costs in this business are so high, that only one company can survive the competition. Now, we could argue about how government makes this problem even worse than it would otherwise be, but that's beside the point. Property insurance companies would not face extremely high fixed costs, just like other insurance companies today do not. Therefore, they would be faced with a healthy dose of competition.

&gt; What if the wealthy person owned the private court?

Why would you sign a contract where the other party owns the court which is assigned to rule over said contract? It's also possible that the contract defines abstract due process standards, such that any court can rule on the contract as long as those standards are upheld.

&gt; And what if these contracts are not all-knowing and all-foreseeable?

That would be comparable to a shitty law. Both things happen - bad contracts and bad laws. With a bad contract, only the people suffer who actually signed it, providing a great incentive for better contracts in the future. That is not the case with bad laws however, the people who suffer under bad laws and the people who write them are usually completely unrelated. If anything, bad laws are often written specifically to benefit the people who wrote them at the expense of others.

&gt; Who writes these contracts and explains it to the poor person who isn't educated because, as education is purely privately owned, they could not afford it?

I postulate the opposite: Private education would be both better quality and cheaper. There would be a certain level of private charity for those who still cannot afford that. (Obviously the system can't depend on that charity, as no minimum level of charity can be guaranteed.) Secondly, the quality of such insurance contracts don't depend on every single customer being perfectly informed about it. It's enough if a small group of customers is educated about the contract for there to be a strong incentive for insurance companies to provide good contracts. Therefore, it would be sufficient for most people to just ask a few friends what contract they got, maybe check out some comparisons on the internet.

&gt; Why not? If there's profit to be had, what stops a disreputable company from signing such a contract? [...] Happen to have any studies or facts and figures or are you still speaking solely in hypotheticals in your utopia?

We're talking hypotheticals here. But it's a logical conclusion from economic theory or just common sense. You might want to look up the concept of moral hazard. The reasoning is also related to the famous [market for lemons](https://www.iei.liu.se/nek/730g83/artiklar/1.328833/AkerlofMarketforLemons.pdf). Basically, if one or more companies offered such a contract, all criminals would go to those companies and commit crimes without punishment. That would mean that prices of those contracts would have to rise above the price of contracts which do not protect criminals. Non-criminals would therefore stop buying these contracts and get a cheaper one instead. The price of such a contract would basically rise to the level where it's not profitable anymore to be a criminal or where it would be just as costly to simply rent your own private army. One way or the other, such a contract could not survive on the market. What keeps private armies in check is another question.

&gt;real insurance companies drop people quickly, often as soon as a car accident happens? Or prior to Obamacare, the moment their customer got cancer?

Whit the car accident, I believe it's just your premium that goes up. Which makes perfect sense, because you now statistically pose a greater risk and therefore cost to the insurance company. With both car and health insurance, it's possible for a contract to be offered on the free market where you are automatically eligible to extend your contract at the same or almost the same price indefinitely. That comes obviously at an additional cost, because such a contract doesn't only hedge against current risk, put also against the risk of your immediate risk increasing in the future. More security means higher price. If such an option doesn't exist for any particular contract, then there's no demand for it. And I'm not worried about providing stuff people don't even want.

&gt; What stops an insurance company in your world from simply saying, ""The cost-benefit analysis shows you're affordable to insure due to where you live [poor neighborhood], therefore we are dropping your insurance plan.""

That situation would simply result in the insurance company offering you a more expensive contract. Obviously, one the free market one needs to pay an insurance company according to the risk they pose. If your situation you describe is true, I would assume that to be the result of either government intervention (It might not be allowed to charge people based on where they live, meaning it actually does become unprofitable to offer insurance in high-crime neighbourhoods.) or simply the fact that the people in such a neighbourhood do not demand such insurance. If that's the case, then that is en expression of the fact that those people think their money can be put to better use elsewhere, instead of such an insurance contract. Forcing them to get insurance would therefore worsen their situation, which I reject on principle, but is especially mean-spirited because those people have it tough already.

&gt; Since the poor person can't afford to take them to a private court to enforce the contract, they're out of luck.

Actually, court fees and potential fees imposed by private police / enforcement agencies would be payed by the losing party. The same reasoning applies here as to the impossibility of insurance for criminal activity. If there was an insurance company who offered a contract where you don't have to pay the court fees even if you lose the case, all criminals and shady businesses would go to that company, making the contract more expensive and in the long run unprofitable, even for shady companies. Therefore, poor people can actually get free private court services if they are surely in the right. Now, if someone isn't entirely sure to win the case, there can be insurance offered for the court fees, the price of which would depend on how likely that person is going to win the case.

&gt; Source? Also, in real life, even though it's a good chance the rich person will get off scot-free, there's at least a chance the poor person will get justice. This won't happen in an ancap society.

Speculation. That statement is not to be taken too seriously. I don't care how much it might cost to bribe today's state police, I'm content in knowing that it would be extremely expensive to rape people in an ancap society. The ballpark number for ""the price of rape"" is what it would cost to militarily overpower the association of all global private property insurance companies. I'd say we're talking trillions here. With that kind of money, you could also just take over a state in the present day. My countries military budget is currently around 5 billion. I don't see many billionaires trying to take over my country so the can rape people. Prostitutes are cheaper.

We can actually arrive at the conclusion that rape would cost you a whole lot only by assuming that people are self-interested. Now, the situation looks even better if we take into account that people mostly care about each other to some extend. There would - like you are displaying right now - be outrage at the idea that a rich person can just do whatever he/she wants. The mob would likely take matters into its own hands. I also imagine it's harder to make soldiers obey your order to kill innocent people by bribing them with money rather than by appealing to their patriotism. Possible, but harder.

&gt; it's not profitable to educate everyone to real-life public education standards - real life again proves this

The opposite is true. Check out India, the public schools are so bad that poor people are sending their kids to private schools which cost them money on top of the taxes they pay for public schools. Comparing public schools in western Europe to private schools in central Africa is comparing apples to oranges. Our public schools are pretty good because we throw insane amounts of money at them. Now imagine what the private sector could do with that kind of money.",True,0,1515074396,,False,0,ds6e1mo,False,t3_7npg8l,t1_ds69qok,/r/EnoughLibertarianSpam/comments/7npg8l/ancap_discovers_the_revolutionary_concept_of_taxes/ds6e1mo/,1517555621,-1,False,EnoughLibertarianSpam,t5_2tzlb,public,

wehavenocoins,,,"This is an interesting way at looking at it. However, it is kind of weird in that since Ripple is the one issuing XRP, it could be a liability like how domestic currency are liabilities to central banks. I am not sure that is an equivalent comparison. 

The value in Ripple seems to lie more in their software than XRP, since it isn't entirely clear why XRP would be necessary, anything could be the reserve currency. This issue bugs, specifically its use as a bridge currency. I have a post about this, but if anybody can expound on this specific issue I would appreciate it. 

Ripple states:
""4) We don't target the biggest corridors like USD-&gt;EUR because they're efficient. We target an inefficient, but fairly high volume, corridor. For example, EUR-&gt;INR. Market makers have very small profit margins, so even a small incentive to place good EUR&lt;-&gt;XRP and XRP&lt;-&gt;INR offers can beat what banks are getting now through the correspondent banking system.""

The example is interesting. It isn't clear to me how they quantify inefficiency in regards to Euro-Rupee pair. I am not familiar at all with the Indian Rupee. However a significant amount of trade does go on between the Euro zone and India: http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/countries/india/

It seems that India runs a current account deficit and the EU is India's number one trading partner. I am going to try to stylize this specific example: India runs a payments imbalance with the EU, which generates an imbalance in the foreign exchange market; i.e. Indians are selling more Rupees than Europeans want to buy, by extension this would cause a depreciation of the Rupee, making Indian exports cheaper. The end result is the payments imbalance would be corrected.

I am assuming that markets are efficient enough between the EU and India because trade is significant between them. From a trade perspective I can't really reconcile Ripple's example. So I assuming they are addressing specifically small (local?) currency transactions? Which is totally fine and makes sense I guess. However, in regards to that, first: would that not be a rather insignificant part of the market, relatively speaking; second: if the reasoning is that would eventually lead to more widespread adoption of XRP, why would that be the case if the reserve currency is the US dollar? And if the goal is to have XRP be the reserve currency, why would they do that? Especially given trade concerns, such as India buying dollars to keep its currency weak in regards to India-US trade? The dollar could be thought of as a ""bridge"" currency.

I am looking for feedback specifically in regards to the use case of XRP as a bridge currency. Perhaps someone with significant experience in currency markets and/or trade.

[deleted],,,"For anyone who is interested in the strange patchwork of ancient American history:

Siberian-Altai-Caucasoid (Non-Traditionally Amerindian) haplogroups are found in high frequency in Algonquian Peoples. These haplogroups are from an ancient (&gt;13,000 years) admixture, meaning they aren't from post-Columbian European settlers OR the Vikings that inhabited parts of Newfoundland. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_X_(mtDNA)#North_America

Seafaring peoples had settlements in **Southern Chile** thousands of years before the Bering Land Bridge allowed the Clovis (from which Amerindians are descended) to cross into North America:

&gt;The most prevalent theory today is the coastal migration hypothesis, which argues that people migrated from Asia down along the western coasts of North and South America.[19] Monte Verde is located 8,000 miles south of the Bering Strait. **Such a considerable distance was probably unreasonable to trek by foot, especially on ice.**[20] Furthermore, remains of 22 varieties of seaweed are referenced in regards to this theory. Modern native inhabitants of the regions use these particular local seaweed varieties for medicinal purposes. Using an ethnographic analogy, this suggests that the Monte Verde residents used these varieties for similar purposes, which further suggests an extensive knowledge of marine resources.[21][22] **Together with a relative lack of stone tools, it appears that these first settlers were maritime-adapted hunter-gatherer-fishermen, and not necessarily big-game hunters like the Clovis.** Therefore, it is feasible that they traveled along the coast by boat or along the shoreline, and could survive on marine resources throughout the voyage south.

But not the right syntax.

Yes, European colonialism brought as much bad as it did good, moreso especially in certain areas. But my point is: Europe is not unique in this regard. Every other people on Earth have done the same to various effects, with long-lasting consequences that have either reshaped the cultures of their neighbours or have negative repercussions today.

Ottoman interference in the Middle East, North Africa, and Europe? Hello, redrawing borders long before the British ever Mandated anything there. Hello, genocide and diaspora. Hello, religious or cultural violence that continues To This Day.

China? Man, that Middle Kingdom seriously assumes itself to be the center of the world. Exploitative relationships with neighbours and their own peoples. Rip ethnic minorities. I applaud them for cleaning up a lot of their practices, but their massive global reach isn't benevolence alone. Small islander me, plenty of benefits to Chinese business... but I'm just as wary of their grip as I am that of Americans. Closer ties with Europe would be far less damaging.

My point is, we are all guilty of pushing into/exploiting/destroying/displacing our neighbours. And for many across the world, their long-lasting effects are just as damaging, if not moreso, than European colonialism. Often, without any European influence to drive it. Acknowledge the influence, but don't cling to it as an excuse. We have agency **today**. We are obligated to fix the world for the better, because of the mistakes of the past.

in our game of knights, vikings and samurai, i would like to have outfits in the style of knights, vikings and samurai, and not these modern 20th century + abstract art and geometrical pattern crap all the fucking time. 

don't get me wrong i'm not against having these at all, i'm against only getting these. i also know design is not an easy job, but by now it looks like whoever designs these has given up completely. 

every village in middle europe has it's own coat of arms, in germany alone that is more than 30k. each of these would make a better fitting design for knights than this mess. 

for samurai, just for the fun of it, google for kimono patterns, there will be a million different beautiful, matching patterns, mostly floral designs. 

for vikings, i agree it is the hardest, but not impossible, alone with celtic knot patterns you can make a ton of outfits. and what about runes? there is not a single rune icon in the entire game (except for tattoos). 

please, for the love of god, give us proper battle outfits, not these abstract ones.

VAT is levied on nearly all goods and services. Import tariffs are more selective - but still not as granular as being a ""VR"" tax. I assume VR goods are taxed under a general consumer electronics category. Now the EU definitely DOES have domestic producers of consumer electronics. So you're complaint boils down to ""why aren't tariffs more selective"".

The answer to that would be that the system is incredibly complex as it is and to be granular down to the level you're requesting would require a huge increase in bureaucracy and red tape and would cause more hard overall than good.

Why have import tariffs at all? Complex question and not one that really splits down left/right lines very neatly. The right recently was the generally in favour of less tariffs (""free trade"") - at least on the face of things - but Trump has returned the US to an old protectionist stance.

ZwolfVonHammersmark,,,"Regarding Brady's comment on a single warrior being sent out to fight on behalf of a whole army- this was absolutely a common thing in MANY cultures, but history has kind of steamrolled the idea. 

IIRC, the ""type"" of warfare used depends on population and resources;
Low population and High resource places had a mutual interest in keeping deaths to a minimum, and had relatively little to fight over. Thus, combat was ritualised, and mock or proxy battles were used to settle disputes. Everyone fights, no-one dies, and then whoever is less bruised won. Or you gamble ONE dude to fight one dude and then that settles it. 
People native to the amazon basin warred like this, for example.

High Population low Resource places had aggressive battles (expendable!) fought over goods necessary to survival (food, cattle, slaves) , which would then be brought back to their own land. Killing was an option, but wiping out the enemy was always a worse solution than just somehow taking their stuff. 
Early african warfare, is a good example.

High Resource High Population? Well, that's what took off in Europe, China and Japan and focuses on high aggression (expendable troops!) in order to control population and land. This gives incentives for wiping out armies and native groups too, as you're fighting over where they exist, something you can't just drag home and let them be. 
So many people and resources also mean occupation is actually a possibility, and you can have large warrior classes and standing armies etc. 
This type of war makes empires, and it's ""exterminate"" perspective means it tends to trump the other kinds. So naturally it's the only type of war still around.

As for the rules, are you serious? Have we not seen the same movies?

Ballistic armor still increases survival chances by an order of magnitude. And especially against ""small arms"", they are remarkably effective.

&gt; you underestimate what people own and overestimate military equipment.

You overestimate civilian supply lines as opposed to military stock.

&gt; as people spend their lives accruing it.

Which is a problem as you yourself will not be able to really use your entire arsenal, and i doubt many people would just give their personal surplus to people that don't own weapons themselves. Having 15 guns in your locker does not increase your combat effectiveness significantly over having two or three, nor does it increase your chances of survival since ""shooting the bad guys first"" is not really an effective strategy.

Reducing a diverse population to one stereotype is. Especially if your profession boils down to shooting at them AFTER you label them with this stereotype.

&gt;They are poor people with poor quality firearms. The average income in Afghanistan is less than $2,000 per year. A magazine of ammo is literally a week's work.

A. Not everyone in Afghanistan is a combatant. 

B. This is exactly the kind of dehumanisation i was talking about.

C. Are you aware of the meaning of the word ""before""?

&gt;My state has the largest cave system in the world. If anywhere is equipped for a sustained landwar it's the Midwest and Rockies in the U.S.

For one, that leaves about half the country exposed, including several population and industrial centers, even if it were feasible. For another thing, i think you overestimate the effect of (what is essentially) one very large cave and a more or less useless natural barrier that will hinder both sides equally. These two, especially since they are separated and charted, provide far less of a tactical advantage than the largely mountainous and uncharted regions ISIS and their predecessors are using right now.

&gt;Under the same banner, Alqaeda. Not defeated. 

Yeah, sure, if you boil all of this down to Alqaeda, you are right. In that case, i will say that the world has been at war for some 12 thousand years, with humans fighting against humans.

Jokes aside, lets see how it really works over there, if we just focus on this ""War on Terror"":  
From 2003, you start fighting against **Iraq**. It took you about two months to steamroll in and declare an end to combat operations. The enemy leadership goes into hiding and their army is disbanded, the US troops occupy the land. This is the first *victory*. Note that the war was still, officially, on.  
The US fuck up putting any kind of temporary government in place, humanitarian aid is essentially non existent. Result: People *dislike* the invaders. The **Mahdi Army** is created and becomes active about one year after the initial invasion. (They are neither Alqaeda not Iraqi military!). A general insurgency of civilian religious groups  has been going on fro a while then, and escalates quickly. A truce is reached with the insurgents, the US troops abandon several cities. Shortly after, the occupation is declared over, a new government is put in place. This is the second *end*.  
In 2006, Alqaeda becomes active and the situation destabilises further. Iraq soon is widely regarded as a failed state. US troops withdraw without much further action in 2011. This is the *third* time one could call an end to american operations in the region.  
In the following years, multiple independent militias form and fight each other, culminating in a civil war in 2014, after **ISIL** gains power in the region. It gets rather complex at this point, but for a handy list of who was involved, you can check [**this one**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_armed_groups_in_the_Iraqi_Civil_War). Some of these groups are affiliated with Alqaeda, but equating them would be a gross oversimplification. ISIL has been declared defeated in Iraq last december, and with them gone, assume that the power struggles between the new Iraqi government and the insurgents will resume soon.

Long story short: ""Under the same banner, Alqaeda."" is a gross and essentially factually wrong oversimplification of the major screwup that is the middle east.

(To be honest, i am not an expert on this. But i know enough to say that boiling everything down to ""Alqaeda"" is just making things too easy for oneself)

&gt;They take an oath to uphold the constitution. Police shooting unarmed isn't comparable. Unarmed does not mean not a threat.

So much wrong with that, i'll try to make a short list:   
- Not like oaths have ever been broken or your constitution ever been ignored. Not to mention the far easier option of calling the uprising civilians ""enemy combatants"" and restricting what information the soldiers get. Isn't the patriot act wonderful?

- Well, it is an american shooting another american he was actually supposed to protect. Their own ""Flesh and Blood""

- You serious? We have a word for this (killing an unarmed civilian) in the civilised world: *Excessive Force*

&gt;you need the entirety to be loyal. If even a single mechanic refuses to play along things will go to shit.

Ok, who told you this shite? ""If a single mechanic deserts, all military hardware will cease to function"". 

&gt;similar to EU

&gt;This is the most important decision we have taken as a nation since the Second World War. It decides the destiny and fortunes of our children for years to come. 

That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever read from a man who took part in an invasion that ""reduced living standards"" by ending lives, torture, destruction of infrastructure, terror tactics, police-state like behaviour, etc.

Honestly I want to stay in the EU but have been pretty convinced we can't since the referendum. But even if I was sure we could still stay I would want Blair as far away as possible from ""my"" camp. 

The man is absolutely toxic regardless of some of the redeeming traits of New Labour's time in government. 


Also ignoring the man himself the argument isn't even good, despite what some people here seem to think.

&gt; The issue is whether as facts emerge, as the negotiation proceeds and we have clarity over the alternative to present membership of the EU, we have the right to change our mind; whether the “will of the people” – this much abused phrase – is deemed immutable or is permitted to mutate as our perception of reality becomes better informed. 

Yes but let's carefully ignore what happens if we change our mind again? If this time 48% want to leave and then behave in the same way? 

&gt; When we voted in 2016, we knew we were voting against our present membership of the European Union, but not what the future relationship with Europe would be. 

That's like saying that in a GE people don't really know what they are getting or don't really understand the implications so we need a do over. If people are so stupid they cannot grasp the implications of what they are doing then that calls into question the idea of democracy, because simply voting again on the issue does not change it. 

Blair either cannot or will not apply his own rhetoric to the other side of the argument. Currently everything he is saying can completely backfire and if Blair is right here then that would mean it would also be right for Brexit people to do the same if they had lost or lost a second referendum in the future.

&gt; It was like having a general election in which the question is “Do You Like the government”? If that were the question, few incumbent governments would be re-elected. 

Yeah just like that except the question was not ""do you like the EU?""... 

Once again I'm sure Blair knows how full of shit he is but knows how easy it is to tell people what they want to hear. 

If he's saying the EU referendum was basically asking that because of the rhetoric, emotion, etc surrounding it then...well...I don't even need to discuss it Blair is 100% smart enough to grasp that the same factors are definitely at play in a general election.

Do you know what I can't even be arsed. The people who are going to see exactly what Blair is trying to do and the flaws he is skating around, even if they agree with his aims and tactics, already have seen it. The people who think his argument is airtight and he isn't just doing what he always did best (spinning and twisting things to achieve what he has decided is best) are not going to be persuaded by anything I have to say.

&gt;""The thing about set lists is 

&gt;They don't change often once we find good transitions and good spots to improvise and jam a bit. The problem is that not everyone has seen that set list yet and those transitions. The set is new to most of the crowd. Another reason it doesn't change is: Remember that jam they did out of The Woods? Remember that My Mind jam? Remember that AKA M80 The Wolf jam? I see it pop up a lot *""why don't you play those jams anymore?"". We played those jams for a year or two before retiring them or repurposing them. A year is a long time to play a set list, sure, but 2 years from now you'll see the same thing ""why don't you open with for whom the bell tolls anymore??"". We play relatively the same set for a while so those things that you found exciting about the show can then be shared with your friend who couldn't make it out or the new fan that you've finally convinced that ""DUDE! You gotta see them live! They open with fuckin' Metallica and transition through songs without stopping! TRUST ME, BRO!"". Y'all we're lucky enough to catch those earlier shows and that in itself is ridiculously cool for us to know that some of you have been around that long. But if you were there, then be happy with that. It's amazing. Just don't be the person that complains about repeating set lists and in the same breath asks why we don't play any of the older stuff. We did that for years and years and right now I'm trying my best to create those same experiences with new material. It'll take a moment but it will be worth it. 

&gt;It all takes time to work out and trust me, we think about you all here on this sub when we make set lists but ya gotta consider the other people attending. The set has changed, it may not have changed quite 'enough' for some of the older fans but you gotta keep the machine running. We will be changing up the set before we head to Europe next. If it feels like an improvement or at least equals the power and flow of this set, we will continue on with it.

You don't know what youre talking about. Are you European? Because I am and me and you have a totally different view point.


Capitalism till this day is dragging millions of people out of poverty, capitalism is making sure people are not starving to death and eating their children like they did under communist regimes.


Intellectuals came out of their palaces and down to villages and told resentful losers that successful people are oppressing them, that resulted in farmers and business men being killed. Because successful farmers were killed off millions starved to death.


If communism is so great, why are millions of people flooding into America and  to this day communist regimes are still falling and people in communist regimes are still starving to death?


Sweden is a lot smaller than the US. It's also has a population that isn't mixed like ours and it's a tiny countr, the degree to which it has socialized programs makes sense they're all pretty much the same people, except now that they have a flood of ""refugees"" and it's only a matter of time before they get raped and murdered out of existence.

Also we never had a massive genocide, trail of tears doesnt count because we weren't even a real country yet, we were exploring and expanding and nearly every American had nothing to do with that situation.  McCarthy concentration camps? No such thing, but Americans were put in jail and silenced for having a set of beliefs much like liberals are silencing people for beliefs and punishing them. Reddit, Twitter,  Facebook and YouTube are censoring people. Facebook is under fire for something to do with Russians... I mean it's McCarthyism all over again.


Yes there were camps in communist regimes and they are oppressive.

koopcl,rojo,Team Luchín,"&gt; Espacio es fácil de solucionar, puedes hacerlo incluso en departamentos y en interiores.

Haz visto los hoyos de mierda donde vive la mayoria de la clase media/baja? Esos complejos de deptos que parecen sacados de pelicula distópica? El espacio es SUPER reducido, y una wea medianamente siutica como tener compost no va a ser prioridad (en especial aquellos que no tienen balcón o tienen uno demasiado pequeño, porque sigues necesitando de aire que circule).

&gt;El tiempo libre depende de cada uno y de que tanta importancia le des al tema.

Harta gente que con las horas que trabaja no es un tema de gustos darle prioridad a estar haciendo compost. Si sales de tu casa a las 730 AM para ir a la pega y estas de vuelta porfin a las 830 PM, no vas a gastar tu tiempo en armarte tu propio mierdal casero en el metro cuadrado de aire libre/balcón que te corresponde. 

Claro, hacer compost no es onda darse el lujo de tener nana, la wea no es tan subida al chorro, pero sigue siendo una especie de privilegio (como lo es cada gasto de tiempo/espacio/plata que no te otorga beneficios inmediatos). No es tan facil como ""agarra una pala y listo"". 

Incluso los paises Europeos donde todo el mundo tiene plata/tiempo para lesear en eso, lo que hacen es tener terrenos urbanos que se arriendan como mini huertos y ahi se ponen a webear con el compost, como un gustito que se pueden dar. No son los pobres los que andan haciendo reciclaje en sus casas. Aca en Chile, digamos que usaste la mitad/todo tu balcón de basural porque no tienen bolsas para botar la mierda (que era el escenario donde propusiste el compost como solución super simple). Ya bkn, se armó el compost, le chanto unas plantas encimas bien bonito. Ahora sigo generando basura, esa la boto nomas, sin bolsas? O el compost que ya tenia armado lo boto para armar otro con la basura nueva? Volvemos al problema de eliminar la basura solo que le sumaste unas semanas de tener basura pudriendose en mi depto. 

No es por tirarte mierda ni nada, y me gusta la idea de tener compost casero y ayudar al reciclaje etc, pero no es una solución al tema, y no es tan facil como pala y listo. Especificamente pusiste el compost como solucion no privilegiada para los pobres, y ellos no van a darle el tiempo (o espacio) a esa wea cuando tienen otras prioridades mucho mas urgentes.

I guess I have to wonder what your point is. It's clear that more people are stepping away from Christianity in the west than ever before. Europe—which was one of the most Christian regions in the world only a hundred years ago—is almost entirely secular, and in most countries it's the exception to be religious. In the U.S. there's been a noticeable decline in the percentage of the population who identifies as Christian (10% over the last couple of decades, if I recall correctly).

All you seem to be saying is that Christians breed like rabbits.

AnimaVestaIsMine,LewisHamilton17alt,Lewis Hamilton,"That article is worth a post itself. 

One if the best articles i ever read about him.

Danny Watts, 2002 Formula Renault champion:

&gt;He was bloody hard but 100% fair,” says Watts. “We clashed once, at the first turn at Snetterton. It was a racing incident – both going for it at the first turn. Normally, you’d blame each other and have a little set-to. We just got on with it. There was no tension.

&amp;gt; “I also remember that he crashed a bit, but never when it mattered. He’d go off in practice, wallop the car and I’d think: ‘That’ll set him back.’ Any other driver would take time to get back on it but, sure enough, his name would pop up at the top of the timesheets in qualifying or the race.”

&gt;Watts also recalls a telling end of season race on the Brands Hatch Indy loop. “It’s a short lap so a tenth of a second can cover five cars in qualifying,” he says. “Lewis qualified on pole by two-tenths and won the race by something like 10 seconds. I reconciled it by getting on the podium and winning the championship, but it was a demolition job.” 

&gt;“He had been racing every weekend from the age of eight. He wasn’t alone in that, but you could see he just got it. He was outstanding in being able to be in the right position on the last lap to take the win. The karts would be nose to tail, swapping order like crazy, but Lewis had the capacity to work out where to be. He was a master of being in the right position.”

&gt;“Quite often we were at the same events, so I could watch him race,” recalls Brown. “I remember thinking: ‘That lad has got something about him.’ His natural talent was there to see.”

&gt; “Every race, it was him or me,” recalls Brown. “So often we would fight over the same bit of track. I was aggressive – I had to be, as I had no team-mates to help me out – but no matter how hard I pushed Lewis, perhaps with a tap here or there, he always kept his composure.

&gt;“He was such a cool racer. The videos of those races are still on the internet, and we just seemed to pass each other constantly; if one of us got ahead, the other would come straight back by. It was hard racing but it was always fair.”


The best one .

&gt;Brown says Hamilton’s determination also stood out. Mid-season, he fell off a bike and fractured his wrist but, after presenting himself to race organisers, Hamilton was allowed to race in a cast at a European Championship round. He won both finals. “I remember seeing him in the paddock and thinking: ‘Well, surely he can’t race?’” says Brown. “Then when he went out to practice, I just thought: ‘Well, good for him, he’s trying so hard, but he’ll never win because it’s too competitive to race successfully with any kind of impediment.’
“There I was in the final going into a corner and this kart came by. It was Lewis. I probably lost another couple of tenths just trying to comprehend how on earth he’d managed it.”

Solfosc,trans-flag,MTFail | Hugh me!,"Every medicament (that is not a prodrug) taken sublingually will reach the maximum concentration peak sooner than taken orally, but due to having higher concentration in blood it will suffer more net metabolism (half-life remains the same) and will have its area below curve (a relation of how many molecules versus time you have in your organism) steeper but smaller. This happens for drugs that don't bind to proteins or when these are saturated (for example due to taking multiple other drugs). Estradiol is 98-99% binded to proteins, and the more concentration you have in blood the more chances you will saturate your plasma proteins and have more molecules unbinded, and also consider the enterohepatic circulation.

First pass effect of estradiol reduces its levels in 97%. The cost is exactly the same for hemihydrate or valerate molecules (however, it's precissely the micronization what increases the pricing); in EU we are prescribed valerate because that's the molecule covered by national health services (or equivalent).

Maximum concentration for estradiol valerate is 4-9 h after oral administration. Source: [datasheet of Progynova](https://cima.aemps.es/cima/dochtml/ft/47814/FT_47814.html) (in Spanish). These values are for 1 mg (15 pg/ml), but we usually take 2-6 mg.

Sublingual concentrations for estradiol are lower than those after 6 hours. Source: PMID 9052581 (I can ask to scan a copy of the full article from my library).

L-u52,,,"Hey! Just finished my Erasmus mobility on December 21st, 2017!

I'm from Malta, in my fourth year of my law degree. I went to the University of Dundee, Scotland and had the time of my life. Naturally, I studied law there too.

I stayed in Scotland from September 2nd till December 21st, although my official academic mobility was between September 7th till December 15th (I think).

Scotland's amazing. I feel like Malta is vastly different from the rest of Europe (for starters, we do not move out of our parents' house for university) so really any country would've been a unique experience for me. Dundee was a great choice. I didn't want a huge city (like London) for fear of becoming homesick (spoiler alert: I didn't get homesick), but wasn't going to settle for a small town either. Dundee was a perfect balance of the two. Plus, it's quite easy (but expensive, I think) to travel from Dundee to other cities in Scotland/UK. The people are great, and the Host University was incredibly professional and of a high standard. 

As you can probably tell, my experience was excellent; just how I pictured it to be. It was challenging (first time living on my own, handling money to a larger extent, living abroad, etc) and exciting. It pushed me to try new things, meet and talk to new people and discover myself a little bit better. I'm making all this fuss because in real life, I'm shy and find it utterly difficult to just go up to people and introduce myself, but Erasmus has helped me greatly in that regard.

The only difficult thing - although not a huge problem, considering how much I spent on travelling and entertainment - was the high cost of living in Scotland. An hour train journey can cost you £20 during peak hours, and I found bus tickets quite exorbitant too, especially when considering how relatively small a city Dundee is. 

As to your last question, the difference is highly noticeable. The Scots are much more liberal than the Maltese. Less loud, but bigger drinkers. Extremely helpful and considerate - seriously they absolutely cannot be anymore nicer than they are. I feel like in Malta we're more family-oriented, however a striking similarity I found between the two countries is our love for our respective traditions. While the Scots are undoubtedly much more patriotic than us, the passion with which I heard them speak about their country, history, traditions and the like is moving. To a certain extent, we're just like that in Malta. 

I hope this helps :) 

Ps. - we didn't have the option to go to Romania, unfortunately. Sorry!

pandaDesu,,,"You are actually correct there in that there just weren't that many women pirates compared to men. Your comment on the superstition is also true as well (not universally obviously, but still spread around). Most pirates tended to arise from disgruntled sailors who were honestly in far worse living/working conditions as British sailors, and so already had the knowledge and skill to easily transition into being a pirate (and since sailors were almost always men, it would make sense that the large majority of pirates were men).

*(Edit: This next section really needs me to go back and find specific citations for it. As pointed out to me, documented women pirates were very very rare, and so I cannot in good conscious let this stand without informing anyone reading this. I will go back and find specific sources/research done on this when I am able to. Currently it is difficult as I have moved across my country and left most of my physical books in storage.)* Where it gets a bit looser is in recruiting non-European pirates. While still definitely not 50/50, due to the way a lot of minorities were treated under colonialism, a lot of non-EU women could have better lives by defecting to piracy (not always the case though, the West Indies was quite diverse, but more applicable in terms of being a former slave for example).

I was reading the Star Wars wiki, apprently they're heavy and require strength to use properly. In fact, that's why Darth Bane's lightsaber was so special: it's the only one that actually is weightless from blade to hilt. 

I'm not an expert on this particular topic, just read it in the wiki. I'm not sure if it was saying the hilt is super heavy or if the blade has any weight, there's apparently a lot of weird stuff with lightsabers (in legends at least). Like, no lightsaber needs a hilt guard because there's like a very small invisible energy shield that protects the hilt so you can't slide the blade down and cut your opponent's fingers or something like that.

White Americans are 73.6% of the country, [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_States).

polish_peasant,,,"&gt; You got a source that white people are in any real danger of becoming a minority?

Sure, just look at the demographic development in the US ever since the 60s for example.

Whites are projected to become a minority around 2040, so from 90% majority to minority in just 80 years.

The same process is happening at various speeds in all Western European countries. Source: immigration and demographic trends that are easily googleable. Just extrapolate those into the future.

But I already expect the same response that I always get, so don't even bother.... ""oh but it can't happen!"", ""oh you can't extrapolate into the future like that!"", blablabla... post WW2 history of immigration and demographic changes in the US and Western Europe still proves me right though.

&gt;Also, where in Poland's constitution does it say that they need to protect any sort of ethnic makeup or that the governments responsibilities have anything to do with racial groups as opposed to it's citizens (nationals)?

So far that was pretty self-evident and obvious for most countries, in Poland it thankfully still is to this day. You won't find many Poles happy with the idea of the large scale Muslim or African migration like in Western Europe, I can guarantee that. I think polls have already shown it, too. Plenty of other countries where this is the case, too. It's mostly Western, traditionally White countries where people are fine with eventually becoming a minority, most of this shit doesn't fly in Asia for example.

Of course I wouldn't mind that sentiment being implemented into the constitution somehow, but at the time being it's not really necessary.

Why do you assume that? It's not like the people who voted to stay in the EU in 1975 stuck with their opinions back then.

Griffith,,,"Eu ando de mota. 

Eu não considero a mota um meio de transporte perigoso, não se a pessoa fizer uma condução defensiva.

Manobras perigosas? Vejo-as todos os dias. As vezes que essas manobras colocam a minha em risco são muito poucas porque, conduzo de forma defensiva.

O que é uma condução defensiva? É conduzir de forma que se alguém fizer uma manobra perigosa a minha vida não está em risco. Exemplo: vou na via rápida na faixa da esquerda a 90, e à direita tem uma fila de carros a 60. Eu reduzo a minha velocidade para 70, continuo a ter velocidade para ultrapassar sem embarassar o trânsito e se, por acaso, algum condutor decidir enfiar-se na faixa da esquerda sem sinalizar ou por súbito, não preciso de fazer uma travagem perigosa para evitar o acidente. Eu aplico dezenos de pequenos cuidados durante a condução semelhantes a este.

A maior parte dos condutores de motas que vejo não fazem uma condução defensiva. Eu diria ainda que a maioria não conduzem com bom senso. Andam colados a carros a alta velocidade, não sinalizam as manobras, não têm cuidado quando a estrada está em má condição.

Muitos condutores de mota conduzem com o mesmo cuidado, ou falta dele, como se estivessem num carro. Eu sei que poucas pessoas concordam com a minha opinião mas se mais condutores de mota se preocupassem em preservar a sua vida em vez de preocuparem-se com quem ""tem razão"" na estrada, haveria muitos menos acidentes.

Eu não me importo de ""perder a razão"" na estrada. Não me importo de passarem quando estou pela direita, de ultrapassarem quando não devem, de cruzarem um sinal de trânsito quando está vermelho. Vejo isso dezenas de vezes por mês. Prefiro evitar por-me numa situação de risco e até agora não tive problemas. Não quer dizer que nunca vou ter, mas até agora, consegui evitar todos eles.

would've been helpful to state the exact statement.

anyway 

""in view of these findings and estimations, we assume that
crimes of violence of refugees in comparison to those of German perpetrators at least twice as often""

this is what they say in the study after compensating for things like language and other non native attributes that might contribute to someone holding back a complaint.

anyway even if you assume that 99% of the crimes by Germans are not reported, i can say that 99% of the crimes by migrants on other migrants are not reported because the assumptions are the same, hell it might be true because they don't even have access to the system there.

&gt;You shouldn't randomly assume anything.

isn't there a correlation between illegal immigration and increased crime according to the study?

&gt;Germans are less likely to report violent crimes if the attacker is native.

is it that less people report attacks by natives?, if not, what exactly does less likely to report mean?, if anything else i would believe the opposite to be true, Europeans are hugely afraid of being called racists and might hold back complaints when the perpetrator is a foreigner.  

&gt;The conservative estimate is that only 5% of all of Japan's sexual assault cases are reported. Meanwhile, around 20% of sexual assaults by US soldiers are reported.

404 page not found, anyway I've heard these kinds of statements before, if there are less crimes being reported, what i want to know exactly is if you know that only 5 % or 10 % or whatever of the  cases are reported then how are you estimating the number of cases that are not being reported? 

is there a sexual assault quota assigned to each country?

&gt;Don't you see the irony in claiming ""We should deduce conclusions from data that we have"" and then one sentence later saying dismissing the data because it doesn't fit your preconceived notions?

did you understand my comment?, i said we shouldn't draw conclusions from data that we don't have, and yes there is an irony here in you talking about preconceived notions.

deMohac,,,"There is a common misconception that the knights that chose to travel to the Holy Land for the First Crusade were minor nobles from cadet branches, interested in potential personal gain. The many written accounts of the crusade (the best documented crusade and one of the best documented events of the middle ages) don't give that impression at all. People going on that crusade truly felt that they were soldiers fighting in Christ's army. The knightly ethos that would compel them to protect their king if his land were to be taken unjustly, fit perfectly with their view of Christ-the-King wronged by the Saracens, who had taken what was rightfully his, the holy city of Jerusalem. 

If anything, we have written sources that show that knights and their families were investing a lot of personal funds on this armed pilgrimage, with no prospect for financial gain. The cost of funding one knight for the long and arduous journey was staggering, often more than three times the annual income of the family of a landed knight, and there are many written records of land and properties sold or mortgaged to raise funds for the crusade. And of those who survived the journey and made it to Jerusalem, nearly all returned home, bringing back no significant riches, mostly just relics of the Holy Land. 

Among the elite leaders of the crusade, honest religious fervor motivated them, according to the many accounts of the crusade. Even Bohemond of Taranto (a Norman from southern Italy, the son of Norman knights who did travel from France to Italy around the middle of the eleventh century for the potential of loot and land, and ended up conquering all of southern Italy and Sicily), is not singled out in the chronicles as one interested in personal gain, even though he ends up becoming the ruler of the Principality of Antioch. And we can't even blame the written sources as being biased in favor of the knightly class, since nearly all of the chronicles of the crusade were written by clergy, and tend to narrate the events from the point of view of the many religious men who went along on the crusade.

But Jerusalem, together with the major episcopal sees of Antioch and Alexandria, had been conquered by the Arabs in the seventh century, about 450 years before the call to a crusade by Urban II. So why was there suddenly a great urgency to liberate the holy land at the end of the eleventh century, when it did not seem to be a significant priority for the previous several centuries? 

The level of religious fervor demonstrated by the nights and by ""commoners"" who went on the first crusade was fairly new. One significant factor was the presence of millenarist ideas, with many people believing that the end of the world was near. In 1064-65, about 7000 people went together on a pilgrimage from Germany to Jerusalem, believing in the millenarian significance of the date of Easter for that year, that they thought to be the same date in which Christ was resurrected. This strain of lay Christian faith is at the forefront of a movement that will span several generations in a variety of forms, and in the thirteenth century can be found on one hand in the Cathars in Italy and France, strongly opposed by the church as heretics, and on the other in the mendicant orders, Franciscans and Dominicans, which were instead accepted by the church. The accounts of the first crusade include many charismatic religious figures, visionaries and mystics, such as Peter the Hermit and Peter Bartholomew, who play an important role in the crusade, especially when the knights and the rulers hesitate in advancing towards Jerusalem.

The church of the late eleventh century is also quite different from the one of the time of the Arab conquest of the holy land. The papacy had been asserting its primacy over the temporal leadership, and had been defining Christianity in ways that were different from the Christianity of the early middle ages. The emphasis on celibacy of the clergy is an example of this ""new"" Christian church, along with the whole investiture controversy and the great schism. The papacy starts to redefine what it means to be Christian, a process that will continue through the Lateran Council of 1215 and beyond. One important way to define what meant to be Christian was to define what was *not* Christian. Theological ideas that were accepted and normal a century before became heresies. Jews, who were tolerated and in mostly in good terms with the Christian communities in which they lived, were seen as the people of the Old Testament prophets, but now become the ""other"", leading to a long season of persecution throughout Europe. Arabs are also ""others"", becoming enemies after being relatively peaceful neighbors in Sicily and the Iberian Peninsula for centuries. The language used in the call to the crusade by Urban II at the Council of Clermont depicts the Arabs in very violent terms, describing the presumed crimes committed against Christians in the Holy Land and the defilement of the holy sites. They are ""others"" and enemies of Christianity. And Urban II talks about the loss of Jerusalem to the Arabs as if it just happened, not as an event from past centuries. Everything is urgent, and violent. 

The world of the late eleventh century was in many ways different from the world of the Arab conquest, from the world of the Carolingian empire and the one of the Ottonian dynasty. Western Europe had just entered a period of dramatic transformation in culture, economy, demography, and especially in the Christian religion. The crusading ideal suddenly had fertile ground to take roots and grow.

Callduron,,,"Lord Adonis said: 

&gt; . If Brexit happens, taking us back into Europe will become the mission of our children’s generation, who will marvel at your acts of destruction. 

It seems inevitable that Brexit, if it goes through which seems very likely, will get reversed in the 2030s.

So what will be the point of being out of the EU for 15 years?

Well we will get to test the water, find out if there's any substance to claims that being able to sign off a trade deal with 1 signature is better than having to wait for dozens. The arguments will drag on about whether staying in the EU would have left us richer.

We will make trade deals with other countries that will see British shops filled with products that would not meet EU standards. We will then have to get rid of all that crap and cancel our new trade deals as part of the process of rejoining the EU.

The costs of the Brexit and Rejoin projects should not be overlooked. Thousands of civil servants spending years on it (assuming they bother to do their impact assessments this time), a near paralysis of every other policy agenda and a toxification of public discourse. Expect more family rows in your old age as your grandchildren in 2030 complain that they're for an independent Britain and you're a cruel old fossil who's dragging them back into the EU against their will.

Perhaps most sadly of all if there were anything to Brexit then it's unlikely we will see positive results before we rejoin. Realistically we won't really be in full less regulated trading frenzy until the late 2020s and it would take a while for that to build up to surpass the trade we currently do with the EU and the projected growth had we stayed.

So all told Brexit will end up being completely pointless and needlessly divisive and could put us into a generational pattern where each new generation angrily objects to the choices of the last one.

The purpose when I create this character are showing all game studio around the world 1 potential character which can become a main character of a new 3rd action game , can beat the profit of God of war , Devil may cry ,….  
  
When your game profit low , you should compare potentiality of this character and all kind of character from God of War , Devil may cry , ….. , all kind of character from comic , movie and any other character from entertainment industry .  
  
When your game profit low , you should compare the potential profit of a 3rd action game base on this character and the potential profit of the game project you are working , which one bigger ,**IN NATIONAL DEBT CRISIS , FINANCIAL CRISIS , CUSTOMERS WILL ONLY BUY A THING THEY REALLY REALLY LIKE , IF YOUR GAME SUBJECT IS JUST NORMAL , NOTHING REALLY ESPECIAL THAN MANY OTHER SAME TYPE GAME , WILL THEY BUY IT**  
  
When your game profit low , you should compare the Universe Creation skill when my character use it for … repairing his whacks - this skill can use to eliminate all the enemy , compare that skill with Poseidon rage , Zeus bolt , Medusa head , Titan rage ,…. , or any special skill you know to realize that Universe Creation skill is a especial kill .  
  
Fan of God of war , Devil may cry , … will they like this character at first sight when they see this hero on the disk cover ?   
  
IF YOU'RE GAMER , WHICH GAME WOULD YOU LIKE TO BUY ?  
DO YOU SEE THE POTENTIALITY OF THIS CHARACTER ?  
In Financial crisis , National debt crisis , if you find something good for your studio game , you should show them that thing , because if your studio game invest new game about this character , they will have good profit , and you will not worry about your job . AND ALL I WANT IS A JOB , IF YOUR STUDIO GAME CAN GIVE ME A JOB , WE WILL COOPERATION .  
  
I introduce you to my Angel , Nathaniel Angel .   
  
On the chest , he have the symbol that we know when we go to school , Infinity symbol . My Angel has a couple of swords :His swords contain 10 elements : Fire , Ice , Thunder , Soil - Earth Control , Dead or Living Creature control , Water , Air , Poison , Metal , Plant control . On the center symbol of the sword , I call that is a **Control** symbol . Also sometimes symbol of **power**.  Angel also have belt of champions . He also have skull of Satan , or envoy skull of all type evils Nathaniel angel break the horns of Satan , cut the skull in 4 pieces  
  
When we draw this character on paper , we can decrease all the symbol on the belt except the Time symbol because this is Time control ability of this character . This character have 2 swords , and swords contain control power ability of many elements of this character . This character have 2 fighting styles : with or without swords .  
  
When he don’t use swords , he can fight just like a Superman or Thor . When he fight without swords , he can fight by his muscle strength and a power control Time . He can create a shield energy protect people . The main difference between this superhero and many others superhero is Gene and Key of Life symbol . He can use Gene symbol to heal injury people , with Key of Life symbol , he can go to hell , find the souls of some people and find the dead body of them , then use Key of Life combine the dead body and their souls , bring them back to life . When he fight without swords , his fingers can fire white energy beams at the enemies .  
  
When he fights with swords , there is a rule for him : every day with 24 hours , he can use 2 or 3 abilities only for attacking the enemies , example if he choose Time control ability then he can only use more power abilities like Fire or Thunder when he use Swords . From 12h pm of today to 12h pm of next day , Abilities control reset .  
  
When we draw this character on the paper , belong to the space you draw on the paper , belong to you draw the upper body part or lower body this character , belong to you draw the back , the front , the left or right of this character , you can decrease the symbols of you have to draw ,  
  
This character contain a lot of symbols , and he can pull 2 symbols of his palms and put into the palms of the people he allow to use the power of the symbol , and he can allow some people use his weapons when he don’t use his power except his couple of swords . You will see all of his weapon when you watch vid .  
  
Who are the enemies of this character , son of Satan and the soul of Satan the first , when this character kill Satan the first , his soul really like the shape of body of Anubis , Orochi so he become that **evil** , so the enemies of this character will have all the most famous evil of human kind .  
  
I design this Angel , I can't create a comic serries base on this character because my drawing technique is not good enought to create whole serries , so I hope I can find a comic artist or a comic publisher really interesting about this character and I can cooperate with you to create a serries comic about this Angel .  
  
When he use his strengh and 2 or 3 magic power for 1 day , he just like a normal superhero .  
  
His sword of Judgement have 3 version , C version is for comic .    
  
If I can find a comic artist or a comic publisher really interesting about this character , I will star a Kickstarter project    
   
  
**REALLY ESPECIAL THING :If game about this character release , the best day to do it is Christmas day . Why , because we go to church at night ( night time ) , we release the game at morning time , it's meant angel come first to protect Son of God .
1 REALLY ESPECIAL THING : Many people will almost think about God , but I - Author and Owner say that , just Nathaniel Angel**   
  
My Nathaniel Angel at least can can fight more amazing than God of War. He can hold and throw his weapons by a couple of snake skin . Do you remember that in Holy Bible , sometime , Satan become a snake ? But he can do more then that .   
  
**1 ESPECIAL THINGS : The Cross Alpha Omega , the meaning you can see in many Church paraffin , it's meant GOD .**  
  
** ALL I WANT IS A JOB , THIS CHARACTER IS MY HOPE , AND WILL BECOME YOUR HOPE IF YOUR GAME STUDIO CAN GIVE ME A JOB , but that's not all .**  
  
The whole US and EU like Superhero , and with Infinity symbol on his chest , he is a Superhero , compare my character with DC , Marvel Superheroes , you will understand , and compare with all kind main character of Entertainment Industry like Movie , Game , Comic , ..... which one have more beauty ?  
  
3 Sword , not 2 Sword , the Game screen will become really look like ..... JUDGEMENT DAY .... , this is JUST NATHANIEL ANGEL , IF HE CAN DO IT , BECAUSE GOD ALLOW HIM TO DO IT ....
That's all I want to say .  
  
I don't design this character for fun , I design it for a purpose that some game studio will pay attention on this character , and intend to create game about him , a 3rd game action , and I can have a job . batman , Superman , X men , K r a t o s , ...... , Super S a i y a n , G u n d a m . All kind of character from Game Industry , Movie Industry , Comic Industry , no kind of character can compare with my Angel ....How many people watch my post , can you tell me how many masterpiece like this character that you see in your life ?  
  
 Do you know what I good at , good at IDEAS , my friend ...    
  On You tube they said : ""its a super﻿ jesus with double egg whisk masterpiece "" , another people said , not me ^ ^ ... , so we should call masterpiece  
  
1 more : Where can I buy this﻿ game? , the main point to make a studio have good profit is this .

Troppin,,,"&gt; The ONLY reason it exists is because people felt bad about the holocaust

Zionism (the belief in a Jewish state) started in the late 1800's. European Jews started moving to Jerusalem and the surrounding region long before the Holocaust. There reasons were because A) There were already Middle Eastern Jews living there, B) Jerusalem had religious and cultural significance to them, and C) It was an underpopulated region.

As the early 20th century wore on, anti-Semitism in Germany, Russia, and elsewhere increased, causing more European Jews to move to present-day Israel. By the end of World War II and the discovery of the full horrors of Nazi extermination campaigns against Jews and other minorities, there was already a strong Jewish presence of European and Middle Eastern Jews in the Holy Land.

While the Holocaust certainly played a part in the UN vote to partition British Palestine, it wasn't the only reason. Zionism wasn't a recent phenomenon. When the Arab states rejected Partition Plan and instead invaded the land, the Jews were able to defend their homes, the land they were living on.

That land then became Israel. While some were recent refugees from Europe, the majority were 2nd or 3rd generation, or Middle Eastern Jews. People defending the homes they were born in. After the Arab states lost the war, they took it out on the significant Jewish populations in places like Baghdad, Cairo, and Beirut. This caused a flight of almost a million Jews from Arab states to Israel.

That is why today, about half of Israeli Jews are descended from Middle Eastern Jews. No longer just Jews, Israel is a nation of Israelis. They have both European and Middle Eastern roots, but are a nation and have been for generations.

&gt; I believe that the actions of any Palestinian activist is justified.

cavscout43,,,"Some good points below, figure I'll toss in a bit too. 

From a strategic and long-term point of view, the US is always wary of any Eurasian hegemony that could bring the population and resources to bear at a level to threaten US independence. 

This was first seen in WWI when a Prussian-Junker German Empire threatened to lead an alliance to conquer all of continental Europe, something not really seen since the days of Napoleon (before the US was a global power), and dragged an isolationist US out.

WWII further solidified this view; a German/Italian/Japanese Axis trying to bring Africa, Europe, and Asia into their combined control would've likely been an existential threat to the US, thus requiring intervention regardless of Pearl Harbor. 

Cold War speaks for itself. In the post-USSR 90s, there was no one that could remotely challenge US hard power. 

Now however, as US economic growth remains fairly steady against a backdrop of rapidly growing and developing nations that previously were beneath notice, concerns over the future of Eurasian have re-emerged. 

The downside of a fairly liberal market economy and a robust middle-class means that a nation's economic power cannot be wielded like a rifle targeting strategic points, like authoritarian nations such as China and Russia (where a handful of people directly tied to a centralized government control the vast majority of wealth) can do. 

So, what's a way the US can take some initiative in MacKinder's ""World Island?"" 

Hard power, military intervention, nation building, permanent military presence. 

I disagree that the US is trying to encircle Pakistan as some mentioned; they've been one of the largest welfare babies up there with Egypt and Israel for decades, they're the counterbalance to the Hindu juggernaut next door that's starting to approach it's pre-industrial era global relevance. That being said; the US is starting to see China as approaching near-peer competitor status on multiple fronts, hence India is being courted for military aid in contrast to their Cold War history of Russian military assistance (well both sides). 

My guess is that the US is aware of both Russia and China wanting to exert more control and influence over the vast mineral and energy resources of the poor land-locked Central Asian Republics (the 'Stans), and without any good economic levers to pull there (DC can't just tell Americans investors to pour into somewhere on the opposite side of the world with little infrastructure and weak rule of law), destroying the Jihadi friendly Taliban regime and putting down a large US presence in Kabul kills two stones with one bird. 

The amount of resources and power required to invade the graveyard of empires from the opposite side of the world, and sit there whilst also occupying Iraq (albeit with a lighter and lighter footprint), facing off with Iran, shielding NE Asia from the DPRK, shielding Taiwan from a Chinese invasion (military or otherwise), and shoring up Eastern Europe against a weakly re-surging Russia sends a fairly strong geopolitical message that potential rivals are all too aware of.

adamnemo42,,,"Not easily.  The loss of the eastern half of the empire was absolutely devastating, both monetarily and authoritatively.  The main reason they managed to survive this period was because of a rather dynamic and charismatic emperor that came to power.  He began a process of military revitalization and massive civic works projects across the empire.  He also really started supporting the Church and her moral authority, which of course went hand in hand with the empire's earthly authority.  His successor's would continue along similar lines, even getting the super wealthy to pay their taxes through the combined strength of the threat of military seizing their assets and the church pushing the moral imperative of paying your taxes; 'Render unto Caesar' gets quite a bit of play here.  As one historian would later put it, ""Rome survived with a Bible in one hand and a sword in the other.""  Because of all this Rome manages to keep itself together, if not quite the power it once was.  They never really manage to make much headway further north, and they remain markedly less wealthy and powerful than their eastern sister empire.  At least until their Age of Exploration, then the Byzantine's lack of oceanic access really comes back to bite them.

As for European pagans, their decline yet survival goes to the Gothic Church.  Christianity made ingress in Northern Europe via monastic orders that had completely eschewed their connection to the Catholic Church, since there's no way the rest of Europe would bow heads to the Pope in Rome.  The Church that came from these monks came to build itself around monastic orders, priests are trained in monasteries, abbots are the highest religious authority, and the church hierarchy really goes no further than your nearest monastery.  Christianity's spread from there was a bit slower and less entire than OTL, with varying levels of pagan minorities in many Gothic states.  As well as Iceland, Greenland, and Vinland being European pagan majority nations.  All that being said some version of Norse paganism is really the only kind left in Western Europe, the Celtic pagans having been completely slaughtered or converted by the modern day.

svendskov,,,"The magnetic compass was invented in China as early as 1080, and is first referenced in Europe around 1190 and in the Middle East around 1232. Before answering the question of diffusion versus independent invention for the compass, it is first necessary to give an overview of the history of the compass. 

The magnetic properties of the lodestone were observed in China, Greece, and possibly Mesoamerica. The earliest Greek reference to magnetic attraction comes from Aristotle's *De Anima* written in the 4th century BC and attributed to the philosopher Thales (c. 6th century BC):
&gt;And Thales, according to what is related of him, seems to have regarded the soul as something endowed with the power of motion, if indeed he said that the lodestone has a soul because it moves iron.

The magnet is mentioned by Democritus (c. 5th century BC), and references to the magnet are attributed to Empedocles and Diogenes of Apollonia by Alexander of Aphrodisias (c. 3rd century). Lucretius (1st century) in *De natura rerum* observed that iron rings could be magnetized by a lodestone:
&gt;People wonder at this stone. Indeed it often makes a chain of rings hanging from itself. For you can sometimes see five or more rings hanging down from one after another swaying in light breezes, when each hands down from one another, clinging underneath it, and each feels from the other the force and attraction of the stone. 

In China, the *Huainanzi* (2nd century BCE) mentions that the lodestone attracts iron:

&gt;If you think that because the lodestone can attract iron you can also make it attract pieces of pottery, you will find yourself mistaken. Things cannot be judged merely in term of weight. Fire is obtained from the sun by the burning-mirror, the lodestone attracts iron, crabs spoil lacquer, the mallow turns its face to the sun. Such effects are very hard to understand.

An interesting passage in the *Lunheng* by Wang Chong completed around 83 compares the attractive property of the lodestone with that of rubbed amber. Amber, after being rubbed, will pick up small objects due to static electricity. From Maxwell's equations, we now know that electricity and magnetism are different manifestations of a single force. But this was obviously not known to the Chinese, who attributed both phenomena to pre-scientific idea of *qi*:
&gt;Amber picks up mustard seed and the lodestone attracts needles.  This is because of their genuineness, for such a power cannot be conferred on other things; other things may resemble them but they will have no power of attraction. Why? Because when the nature of the *qi* is different, things cannot mutually influence one another.

Lodestones have also been found in Mesoamerica at an Olmec site by Michael Coe in 1967, dated somewhere between 1000 and 1400 BC, and at a Mayan site by Vincent Malmström in 1973 dating even earlier. However, we have no surviving evidence that Mesoamerican societies were aware of the magnetic properties of the lodestone. The shape of the Olmec lodestone suggests that it was likely used for decorative purposes, possibly as molding.

Back to China, the *Lunheng* also mentions a spoon that always points in the southward direction (*sinan zhishao*):
&gt;But when the south-controlling spoon  is  thrown upon the ground, it comes  to  rest pointing
at the south. 

It's not immediately clear what the spoon was used for, but an interpretation proposed by Wang Zhenduo in the 1940s is that the lodestone spoon would be placed on a diviner's board. If Wang is correct, then this would be an early example of the magnetic compass. However, while there are several diviner's boards dating from the Han dynasty, a surviving lodestone spoon has yet to be found. It's not until the Song dynasty (960–1279) that we encounter the first reliable references to the magnetic compass. The most significant of these is by Shen Kuo in his *Meng xi bi tan* written in 1088, which contains a passage that describes a magnetic compass in detail: 
&gt;Magicians rub the point of a needle with the lodestone; then it is able to point to the south. But it always inclines slightly to the east,  and does not point directly at the south. It may be made to float on the surface of water, but it is then rather unsteady. It may be balanced on the finger-nail, or on the  rim of a cup, where it can be made to turn more easily, but these supports being hard and smooth, it is liable to fall off. It is best to suspend it by a single cocoon fibre of new silk attached to the centre of the needle by a piece of wax the size of a mustard-seed-then, hanging in a windless place, it will always point to the south.

This is not only the first incontestable description of a magnetic compass, but also the earliest known mention of magnetic declination. As Shen Kuo observed, the compass does not point exactly south (or north, whether a compass points north or south is largely a matter of convention). The magnetic north pole varies from the true north or rotational north pole. 

In the *Wu jing zong yao* completed in 1044, the military applications of the compass as a tool for navigation are discussed:

&gt;When troops encountered gloomy weather or dark nights, and the directions of space could not be distinguished, they let an old horse go on before to lead them, or else they made use of the south-pointing carriage, or the south-pointing fish to identify the directions. Now the carriage method has not been handed down,  but in the fish method a thin leaf of iron is cut into the shape of a fish two inches long and half an inch broad, having a pointed head and tail. This is then heated in a charcoal fire, and when it has become thoroughly red-hot, it is taken out by the head with iron tongs and placed so that its tail points due north. In this position it  is quenched with water in a basin, so that its tail is submerged for several tenths of an inch. It is then kept in a tightly closed box.  To  use it, a small bowl filled with water is set up in a windless place,
and the fish is laid as flat as possible upon the water-surface so  that it floats, whereupon its head will point south.

This is known as a wet compass because the fish-shaped ""needle"" is suspended in a liquid. The Song also made use of a dry compass, which is mentioned in an entry of the *Shi lin guang ji*, an encyclopedia likely compiled sometime after 1135:
&gt;They also cut a piece of wood into the shape of a turtle, and arrange it in the same way as before, only that the needle is fixed at the tail end. A bamboo pin about as thick as the end of a chopstick is set up on a small board, and sustains the turtle by the concave under-surface of its body, where there is a small hole. Then when the turtle  is  rotated,  it will always point to the north, which must be due to the needle at the tail.

The compass being used at sea is first mentioned in *Dong jing meng hua lu*, written around 1126:
&gt;During dark or rainy days, and when the nights are overclouded, sailors rely on the compass. The Mate is in charge of this.

The oldest reference to a magnetic compass in the Middle East is the *Jami al-Hikayat* by Muahammad al-Awfi in 1283, which mentions that sailors would navigate with a fish-shaped iron, similar to the Chinese compass described over centuries earlier in the *Wu jing zong yao*. There is a mention in the Arabic *Kanz al-Tijar* by Bailak al-Qabajaqi in 1282 regarding a compass that the author encountered in 1242. Again the iron is fish-shaped, which suggests a Chinese origin, but the Arabic word *al-konbas* has a European origin possibly from Italian.

The first reference to the magnetic compass in the West is in *De Naturis Rerum* by Alexander Neckham in 1190:
&gt;The sailors, moreover,  as  they sail over the sea, when in cloudy weather they can no longer profit by the light of the sun, or when the world is wrapped up in the darkness of the shades of night, and they are ignorant to what point of the compass their ship's course is directed, they touch the magnet with a needle. This then whirls round in a circle until, when its motion ceases, its point looks direct to the north.

A decade later, there is another reference to the compass in *La Bible*, a satire by Guyot de Provins written in 1205. The compass is also mentioned in Jacques de Vitry's *Historiae Hierosolimitanae* from 1219.

Most public transit in this country is bus-based. For longer travels, it's train or plane, and those options are seriously limited.

We have very few cities with a tram or subway system. Iirc Oslo is the only place in this country with a subway, but I could be wrong about that.

You know how they say that in America, 100 years is a long time, and in Europe, 100 miles is a long distance?

Well, that's kinda true. The distances here aren't *that* long mostly, but the terrain is pretty gnarly. Lots of granite everywhere too, so road building is slow and expensive. There's all these twists and turns to get around the geography here, and our road traffic has increased hugely the past 50 years, so you had several iterations of trying to build new roads, without thinking far ahead.

Getting from A to B takes a long time, even when it's a short distance.

It's also worth noting that an American mile is not the same as a Norwegian mile. The American mile is 1609 meters, which is derived from the roman 1479 meter mile, named so because it was a thousand double-steps apparently.

Anyway, we use a metric mile. one yard is just under one meter. So one Norwegian mile is 10000 meters, or 10936 yards, which on these roads is usually about an hour by car.

This is totally subjective, but the RS *felt* like a more solid car.  Why?  That's hard to say.  Was it:

1. The beefier rear subframe they put under it to handle AWD plus the driveshaft tunnel resulting in a stiffer chassis?
1. Better noise insulation materials?
1. Just a better built car?
1.  All in my head?

The things that I could point to and objectively say ""the European version is nicer"" were the trim bits such as the exterior door handles, interior door panels, and the parking brake handle.

The European Focus can also be had with a few more tech niceties like rear parking sensors and rain sensing wipers and I think they even offer a self parking functionality.",True,0,1515104305,,False,0,ds74qnt,False,t3_7o4vsc,t3_7o4vsc,/r/cars/comments/7o4vsc/american_built_fords_and_european_built_fords/ds74qnt/,1517568838,4,False,cars,t5_2qhl2,public,

AllMyName,,,"I like a lot of what you said, but I have to disagree with some of it.

Islam isn't necessarily a ""masculine"" religion. I'd even venture to say that it doesn't *strictly* adhere to ""traditional gender norms."" Muhammad's ﷺ first wife was a successful business woman, and he actually worked for her at one point. I don't mean that you should interpret that as Islam being some feminist patriarchy smashing movement either, because it isn't ; men are expected to provide clothing, food, and shelter for their families as a duty / responsibility, but *a woman has every right to be OK with being a provider.* If you look deeply, there are even teachings on what to make of effeminate men or masculine women. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukhannathun that's not looking deeply at all, but it's a start. 

Secondly, look up the actual statistics on refugees. You are **completely** wrong on everything other than the GCC countries being complete pieces of shit when it comes to offering refugees asylum, because even if you added them all up, they don't come close to the amount of refugees in even one European country. However, Lebanon **by itself** has taken in orders of magnitude more refugees than all of the European countries you mentioned, and didn't mention, combined. Jordan and Turkey also have substantial refugee populations. Your view on this issue is similar to the propaganda that right-wing European political parties have been peddling. [Stats](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_refugee_population) that *don't* include UNRWA refugees, so the millions of Palestinian refugees that have become near permanent fixtures in Lebanon and Jordan are not skewing the numbers.

Sorry if that last part sounded harsh, I'm not sure which part of your comment brought the down votes, and I wish people would've commented because I do feel like you added to the conversation and I hope you learn more about Islam, *preferably from somewhere other than this sub*.

&gt; Spoon is an American indie rock band from Austin, Texas. The band was formed in late 1993 by lead singer/guitarist Britt Daniel and drummer Jim Eno. Current members also include: Eric Harvey (keyboard, guitar, percussion, backing vocals) and Rob Pope (bass, backing vocals - replaced Joshua Zarbo in 2007).

&gt; After releasing their debut LP Telephono on Matador Records, the band signed with Elektra in 1998, but the contract was dropped soon after the band released A Series of Sneaks. In response the band released a two-song single titled The Agony of Laffitte (referring to Elektra A&amp;R man Ron Laffitte). Eventually they signed to Merge Records.

&gt; Spoon has been met with widespread critical acclaim. Girls Can Tell, released in 2001, sold more copies than both their previous releases combined. Kill the Moonlight accomplished the same feat a year later. Gimme Fiction was released on May 10, 2005 and continued the trend of increasing popularity for the band.

&gt; Britt Daniel wrote much of the soundtrack to the 2006 film Stranger Than Fiction. Four tracks by Spoon are also featured.

&gt; The band released their sixth studio album Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga on July 10, 2007; those who purchased the first pressing also received a bonus disc titled Get Nice!.

&gt; Transference is their seventh studio album. It was released on January 18, 2010 in Europe, and on January 19 in North America, to moderately positive reviews.

nikogoroz,PL-02DS,Vratislavia (Poland),"&gt;They are both religious, law and order, socially conservative, eurosceptic right-wing populist parties.

You could say that about half of the governments in EU. It's so vague it doesn't mean anything. Look at Czechia with Babis Ano, Slovakia, Spain, or Lithuania. 

PiS isn't eurosceptic, on the contrary they comply with every EU policy, in spite of petty pseudo crisis that we've seen over last few months. The impression that I get is that you say what you say just because you have no idea about politics in Poland. Who Kaczynski and Tusk are and were. The figures of the government. Your impression is the one we can concieve from establishement media.

PiS- joined Poland into shengen AfD- opposes Schengen

Kaczynski's twin and his political ally joined Poland into EU- AfD wants to quit the EU

PiS wants to reform the EU into federal state with an army and borders- AfD want to pull out in such case

AfD wants to set up racist immigration policies- muslim population in Poland doubled in the last 4 years and PiS doesn't seem to have any problem with that (most of the people don't even know about it)

AfD doesn't want euro in DE- PiS debates on embracing euro in the next 6 years

Who do you think voted for PiS? The same people who voted for PO, and felt that PO has failed them. 

And yes we are conservative, but it's not PiS, but a great majority of Poles. Kaczynski would dress up as a monkey if he found that Poles started loving monkeys.",True,0,1515106532,,False,0,ds76k0j,False,t3_7o1tj7,t1_ds74qj4,/r/europe/comments/7o1tj7/polands_government_prefers_to_embrace_rather_than/ds76k0j/,1517569723,4,False,europe,t5_2qh4j,public,

GhostInTheCode,,,"the headcount really doesn't matter.  there's still a very small percentage difference. I know i'm pulling numbers out of the air for this comparison, but.. it works for this. say the entire population of india had a referendum. a 0.6% difference (like that of wales) would still be 7 million votes. Which is a much larger number than our '1 million vote' margin. It's a very minor victory when the difference is so close to a 50/50 split.

The fact that a government in the past handled it a certain way doesn't change my opinion that government response should be more considerate - and by any means the 1997 referendum was much more clear cut in terms of the questions asked - over the previous 5 years the labour party had prepared a model which the voters were aware of at the time of the referendum - they knew what they were voting for, on a question without any ambiguity.

Which is why I say that the people deserve a referendum on the final deal. With no clear idea of what the public wanted from leaving - the people knew the primary fact (not being in the EU)but not any of the details around that. Do people want a proper border between us and the EU? or do they want free movement? Do people want to work out some kind of trade deal? or should we just take the WTO rates? Essentially, it comes down to the question of do the people prefer the deal we are getting, or is it less preferable than remaining in the EU? (bearing in mind that in some  leave situations, we end up with less say than we did before. a deal too similar to remaining, would mean we still follow their rules, but have no say in any new ones - ones that currently, we could possibly ask for special concessions on like we have in the past.)

WikiTextBot,,,"**White Australia policy**

The term White Australia policy comprises various historical policies that effectively barred people of non-European descent from immigrating to Australia. There was never any specific policy titled as such, but the term was invented later to encapsulate a collection of policies that were designed to exclude people from Asia (particularly China) and the Pacific Islands (particularly Melanesia) from immigrating to Australia. These policies were progressively dismantled between 1949 and 1973.

Competition in the gold fields between British and Chinese miners, and labour union opposition to the importation of Pacific Islanders into the sugar plantations of Queensland, reinforced the demand to eliminate or minimize low wage immigration from Asia and the Pacific Islands.

Consider it like two rival companies. The object is to weaken the other and strengthen your own position. We as the west want Estonia to weaken the Russian and prevent them from getting more influence and at the same time, shore up our own influence in that area.

Now in 1991/2 Yugoslavia broke apart and it was messy very very messy. Ethnic cleansing and NATO peace keepers.

Croatia and slovinia where 2 of these republics. Slovinia got off easily and with no war. So the boarder was just drawn where the administrative line was. A county breakup on administrative lines will pretty much guarantee boarder disputes.

If I remember a bunch of the dispute is based on the river. The boarder was originally drawn where the river actually flowed. But it has changed.

What has happened is they tried to resolve it. The arbitral tribunal released a possible solution in June 2017. One side liked it the other did not. Basically it's just a dispute and the only reason you hear about it now is because something happened.

No it won't lead to war both are in the EU so some of the issues with boarder are gone. If it did not lead to war in the breakup it pretty much never will.

SatanicBarrister,,,"&gt; What is reconciliation to you?

I suppose the big thing here is resolution of ongoing inequities.  One day I'd like to see a society where your ancestry doesn't so strongly determine how people treat you or your prospects in life.

&gt; Should Indigenous Canadians continue to be granted separate status, rights, and responsibilities as citizens that are not available to non-Indigenous Canadians?

No, reconciliation will come with the end of any special legal status.

&gt; Do you view Canadians of European ancestry as less ""legitimate"" occupiers of this land, due to their ancestors' role in colonization? Are some (such as Quebecois) more ""legitimate"" do to their history or longer roots in the lands of Canada?

All peoples with societies that have existed for multiple generations here have an equally valid claim to self-determination on that basis.

To argue that a person and family that knows no other society would have the validity of their claim altered because of their blood is plain racism.

&gt; How do you view Indigenous nationalists?

Sort of like European nationalists (Basques, Scotland, Catalonia).  Or even Quebec nationalism.  Antiquated ethnicity-aligned dead ends pining for an idea that has already entered its philosophical twilight. 

&gt; Do you view Western conceptions of law, philosophy, religion, and political/economic theory, as incompatible with Indigenous culture, traditions, and political governance?

Well that's a doozy.  *It depends*.  In some cases, they're very much not compatible.  The band ownership model for land, for example, is very incompatible with the economics of Western-style private land ownership.

&gt; discussing the (depending on one's perspective) ""adaptation"" OR ""assimilation"", OR ""modernization"" of Indigenous peoples and their lifestyles and customs to the current globalized society as inherently racist, colonialist, or evil?

Is it inherently racist or evil to discuss the modernization/Westernization of Japan in the 19th century?  

Some of the models used are horribly misleading or even racist of course.  Conceiving of it as ""civilizing"" for example, is ridiculous when the civilizers were often more morally barbarous by our own standards than the people they were supposedly civilizing.  

But is there a fairly clear split before and after European contact?  Of course.  Is it meaningful to speak of before and after?  Of course.  For better or worse, for several hundred years now the world has been barrelling on a globalized course and how well *any* society or culture adapts to that reality is crucial to the question of its survival.  

&gt; How much of current socio-economic problems plaguing many Indigenous families and communities do you believe are the direct or indirect result of the policies (either historical or current) of the Canadian government? 

If you expand that slightly from the government to the rest of Canadian society as well, I'd say it's probably fair to place almost all of it.  I'm reminded of research that found patterns of inequality in 17th and 18th century Britain that are still reflected in white anglophone communities in North America.
