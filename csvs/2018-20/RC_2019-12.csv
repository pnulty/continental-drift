All seasons receive the suffix -*lux* /luks/ which means 'time'.

The hot season is *ceinslux* /ʃəjnsluks/, from *ceins* ""hot, warm"". The hot season is quite intense and a bit long, lasting around 5 months. It's noted by a gradual warming from the retreat season, a total absence of clouds or rain, and long days of intense heat. In most of the country, temperatures easily reach around 32-37C daily and in the southern valleys, temperatures of 30-40C daily are the norm. During this time, crops which are heat-resistant and depend on little water are grown. While the irrigation system of the land is well built, waterways often run dry if not inspected upon frequently. The end of *ceinslux* is brought forth by the raging thunderclouds of the monsoons.

The monsoon season, known as *mahiilux* /mahiːluks/, from *mahii* which can mean ""rain"" or ""June"", as the rains begin around late June. The beginning of *mahiilux* is noted by large, sprawling thunderstorms which last for 18-19 hours each with little time to recuperate. This constant barrage of rainfall goes on for nearly three months, where the monsoon begins to lessen (around mid-September). From mid-September to early November, heavy rainstorms are still frequent but don't last as long. By late November, rains would be reduced to a mere drizzle and by December, the rains halt and the sky remains white and overcast. Seeing the sun is a rare occurence in this season. Temperatures during this season are much more uniform, and are around 25-30C. During this season, crops resistant to flooding and those which thrive in heavy rainfall are planted. Rice, a staple of Anula, is grown in this season within well-drained fields to prevent oversaturation of the soil.

Finally, the retreat season, known as *elirlux* /əlirluks/, from *elir* which means ""going"". This is the shortest season and noticeably the most pleasant, with temperatures lasting around 19-23C. During this season, overcast clouds retreat to reveal the gentle, sunny day. It's akin to spring, and happens around mid-December to mid-January. In this time, work and life halt to a slow pace - it's customary for workers to take long vacations to relax and recuperate their bodies. During this time, *sa yurupta ilruni* /sa jurupta ilɾuni/ ""the European crops"" are grown. Due to the mild weather, crops such as potatoes and greens are grown. They're called European crops because a lot of these were introduced from Europe.

Also use their allies to your advantage. Colonial empires tend to ally weak peeps in the colonial regions. Declare war on them and drag the larger dudes in. 

If you’re Britain, it doesn’t really matter if France gets dragged in when you fight Scotland. Be aware of what are your true goals in a war. In a war against Scotland, your true goals are on the British isles. Focus on that and get warscore. Break their alliances. Not every war involves getting land from someone. Sometimes, just taking money from people, breaking alliances, essentially crippling large empires is a much better tactic.

As England/Britain, you also get union CB against France. I know you want to destroy Castile and take their land, but early on, ally them first. Build up some trust with them and then call them in during your French wars. Allies aren’t permanent. 

If you’re really uncomfortable with wars, there’s another way. European gameplays are really interesting because of the Union mechanics. Take diplo ideas, and spread your dynasty to the other empires. Wait until the countries have no heir or a weak heir and claim their throne and take it. A union partner is much better than a normal vassal. Union partners are much less likely to rebel as long as you have a pretty good level of prestige. 

That said, union mechanics are reserved for the Christian nations. If you want to get land from people and stuff, there’s really only one solution. To sometimes take a calculated risk. If you’re France and you have land right outside ottoman territory. Wait until they declare war against the Mamluks. Wait until they’re around 25% war-score and declare war on them.

Lucas even took from a lot of movies to make his own. In no way was Star Wars a real original idea in the first place. And to be fair, it was his wife at the time who pretty much saved it in the first place. 

That’s not saying I don’t enjoy Star Wars. The series are fun action fantasy movies. I’d consider hyphen some of my favorites. 

What I’m saying is that Star Wars went from movie to cashgrab. Granted a lot of the EU was written by fans, and I appreciate almost everything they did to expand on the simple movies themselves. 

Now that Disney owns it, they have the money to just pound out movie after movie after movie. Even the EU got too much at some point.  It’s over saturation, and that leaves a really bad taste in my mouth.

So you're for redistributing private property? because there a lot of empty, quality houses in the Us or Europe.

More than enough for everyone. No need to build more.

And speaking of building, you do realise some of those regulation have very good reason to be there? Like risk of landslide, flooding or other? same with food regulation and other vital shit.

&gt;Anarcho-capitalism *prevents* others from having control over your critical needs. Heck, *that's the entire point of it*.

So diabetics will have their insulin for free? and not at the hundreds of dollars it's currently at in the US? despite estremely low cost of production? Or that wasn't true capitalism?

And why would people keep the capitalism part? If most thing are going to be local, why bother with bosses?

&gt;will be able to easily find and lay practical claim to a decent spot of land somewhere. There is *so much space* on this planet. We haven't nearly filled it up yet. Not even close.

Again, the fucking planet is ***finite***, not all terrain are viable for construction or agriculture and you need to keep some wilderness for the environment.  Be it land or sea.

Garden like what you have in mind don't produce enough to feed family on a daily basis, you still need to get food from somewhere else. And it take time to care for it.

I would prefer a system where people realise that they need each other and acknowledge that nobody want to die because of a lack of healthcare/starvation/insulin-being-too-costly-despite-having-one-of-the-lowest-production-cost and work together to ensure everybody has a decent quality of life, so they can actually enjoy being alive.

There already more than enough food being produced and there \~10 million people working in the food industry for a population of 327 millions in the us (or  429 079 for 67 millions for France), I'm pretty sure we can organize ourselves to share the work for basic necessities while leaving plenty of free time to those who end up with it.

And there plenty of people doing useless job like banker or the military

Doesn't seem impossible and much better than a system calling for continuous growth on a finite planet

How do you know price will fall and not skyrocket like for the insulin?

How deregulation will ensure better quality and lower price?

Started Stronglifts 5x5 on May 1, 2019. Was using dumbbells. Bought the bar + rack last week, starting the bar slowly - at lower weights than the dumbbells - so as not to teach myself bad form. Will add 5-10 lbs week.

**Career:** Landed 400k in new business yesterday. Just got promoted again, a 10k raise + 10k bonus, now in charge of most of the firm's operations. I've got a staff of 25 or so who work for me now. Boss said I was ""the best thing to ever happen in the firm's history"". Learning to STFU about client + personnel issues in the office, too.  My old work plan was to be ""the gal who can understand and explain client needs"" (and I got really fucking good at that), my new plan is to be ""the gal who can fix any operational issue"", and my inspiration is Harvey Keitel's Winston Wolfe, in *Pulp Fiction*.

**Extracurriculars:** Down to one side business (a rental property) and 2 non-profit boards. Had a state legislator reach out to me yesterday morning for me to help write legislation for next year. Sunday night, a nonprofit director came and asked me to take over the presidency of his nonprofit. I said no. 

**Finance:** Doing just fine.

**Health:** Down to 2 drinks/3 days a week - always with other firm leadership or clients. Getting 7 full nights of sleep a week. 

**Appearance** Second-best dressed gal in the firm.the interns come to me for fashion advice.

**Family:** Taking a leadership role at all times. I have set the family agenda for 4 weekends in a row. Put my daughters in BJJ and it's  paying dividends.Laid out a big board with family priorities and just arranged a trip to the West Coast. Planning a trip to Europe.

When someone commits a crime they go to jail. If a american mom goes to jail she cant take her kids.

Those illegal immigrants know 100% what happens when they cross illegally. They do it because they wont qualify the legal way due to criminal record or just don't wanna wait the years it takes. The illegal immigrants spit in the face of legal immigrants. When the europeans came here to ellis island we sent hundreds of thousands back. This is not a race thing as you claim.

And no. America does try to destroy countries. Read a fucking history book. They did it then, and do it now. Trump promotes ant vaxers..rofl. Trump abandoned the curds..... By leaving syria.... When the curds are located 95% in northern iraq. Its not americas job to police the world. Thats what the u.n. is for.

We don't need to figure out how to get babbies out. Its simple. The illegal immigrants can easily stop bringing them. No one is forcing them to come. 

Also look at the illegral immigrants options. Come to america illegally, go to jail for 2 weeks - 2 months, live in a FREE family housing unit with food tv beds cloths until they are processed. OR go to american embasy/consulate and immigrate legaly taking 2 yrs and tons of money for processing fees. Or come to mexico border at entry point and do it there, pay rent in mexico for 6 months until processed.

A few posts ago you were a great provider (your own words).  Now you're unemployed, broke and living with your parents.  Which is it?  If it's the latter, you can definitely do something about that.

`If you think that dying alone is no big deal, then you try it. Try isolating yourself for even a couple weeks and see how you feel.`

I actually live alone by glorious and wondrous choice.  Last month I spent a couple of weeks traveling Japan (where I didn't speak the language) alone.  A few years ago I spent three months riding my bicycle across Europe (lots of languages I didn't speak) alone.  It was the best three months of my life.  In all seriousness, if you have hobbies, interests and passions to pursue, you never get lonely.  Again, try it before dissing it because of some shit you read on the Internet.

`What exactly is that something? Because I really have no idea how to even start looking given what I am looking for.`

Well the first thing you'll need to do is change your attitude and put an end to the pity party.  I've met quite a few conservative virgin girls in my life (none that I wanted to marry, but that's just a personal choice), and I can honestly say that none of them would have had any interest in a guy who's life revolves around reading depressing shit on the Internet and arguing with strangers on the Internet.  Honestly, they wouldn't even stick around long enough to find out that you're unemployed and living with your parents.  Right now you seem so determined to be depressed that you're achieving it through sheer force of will.  Try directing your will power somewhere else.

`It's fine if you're unequipped to help. But then the least you can stop twisting the knife.`

Nobody's forcing you to read it.  Plenty of other things you could be doing with your time.

The simple fact is that the only person equipped to help you is you.  There is no golden nugget of advice that a person can give you that will magically solve all of your problems.  You're going to have to do thing that might make you uncomfortable.  Some times you'll try things that won't work or will blow up in your face.  That's a good thing, because that's how we learn and grow as people.  Ultimately, it's up to you to get off your computer or phone or whatever your posting on, and try something.

It's a crappy, overpriced course claiming to be something it's not. It's exactly the kind of thing we try to steer people away from.

&gt; So I’m trying to compare TESL Canada’s standards to the CELTA.

Unless you actually want to teach in Canada, TESL Canada accreditation means nothing whatsoever. People outside Canada neither know nor care about country-specific accreditation. In any case, big-name certificates such as the Celta will be accepted in Canada.

If your goal is to teach in Europe, you should invest in a certificate from a provider employers are familiar with.

It's not hard to do, but it's labor intensive. On both our cars you have to pull both front drive axles, disconnect the engine supports, lower the engine and gear assembly (gearbox bolted to engine and holds in flywheel/clutch), drain remaining gearbox oil (3-6 liters), unbolt gearbox and lower it (Suzuki weighs nothing Ish, ford weighs 40 kg). Now you can clean up the gearbox for debris like in this picture, and I strongly fucking advice that you replace any hydraulic slave cylinders while you are in here (!!!!) and probably do the pilot bearing too. The clutch itself is bolted to the flywheel and needs to be aligned PERFECTLY using an alignment tool i.e. not hard to do, just time intensive. Every single adjustment needs retorque-ing all bolts in that a pattern, before you hoist the gearbox back up and attempt to wiggle the drive shaft into the tiny hole on the clutch so it aligns and engages. Finally you redo the bolts on the clutch housing / gear assembly, torque them down, raise the engine assembly, reinstall drive shafts, reinstall engine mounts, fill up gearbox oil, probably bleed the hydraulic clutch system if you did that (you should) and finally... You can attempt to start the vehicle and pray it fucking works!!!

I've been told that many cars are much worse because the AC line sometime goes under the gearbox assembly and needs to be disconnected. My professional cousin says it takes him 8-12 hours in a shop for most FWD clutch changes. 

The clutch (with pressure plate) itself is $70 for non original. Add $20 for hydraulic slave, and $5 for hydraulic oil, and $20 for gear oil. Double those for OEM parts on normal vehicles, triple for exotic fancy cars. 

So yeah. To give a real life example, we usually paid $1000-$1500 for a clutch change on our cars before I learned to do it.

Consider where you are staying.  Okay, you have a room with a private bathroom.  It’s probably small, but you  have a personal attendant.  How basic do you want it?  What price would you put on that?

Next might be food.  You’ll have access to a huge variety of food (maybe 24/7?) and you won’t have to pay for it each time you eat.  You’ll also have access to basic drinks.  What might that cost if had to pay separately every meal?

What types of entertainment will you have free access to?  Swimming pool? (That comes free with a lot of hotels, so maybe ignore that, but is there a water park element as well?  That might usually cost you extra)...what about Cabaret shows/cinema etc?  Those would cost extra if based in a single location so assign a cost to it.

Day trip.  So I’m not talking about additional cost excursions.  I’m talking about getting in a car and visiting other towns and cities nearby.  You would likely have fuel and parking costs...the Ship is taking care of that for you and taking you from place to place.  You don’t have to drive, you fall asleep one night and wake up at port the next morning.  What is that worth to you?

Another thing to factor in is the relaxation part.  I had my first cruise this year and it was the very first time I could truly switch off.  Because I didn’t have to think about reading maps to get from A to B, I didn’t have to think about finding restaurants when I felt hungry, I didn’t have to pack and unpack my case or check in to a new hotel every day we went somewhere different.  The Ship did everything for me.  Bliss!

Tot everything up and see if it comes close to what the cost of your cruise could be. I did this for my cruise this year, and actually I felt I came out of it with a bloody bargain (I opted for a basic budget priced bedroom but got the top alcohol drinks package as well which included the daily gratuity fee so I didn’t have any surprise costs by end of cruise). It ended up as an equivalent of $140 per person per day for us (it was a small cruise ship travelling through Europe, no bells and whistles).

Edit: Pre-planned excursions.  So everyone will say about how you can do them cheaper yourself.  Yes that’s true, but if you miss your final boarding time back on Ship you are screwed.  If the Ship does an excursion and it gets delayed getting back (because of traffic or incident) the Ship can’t leave without you as it’s their tour.  I did ship excursions for my first cruise and yes, expensive, but you often skip lines because part of a group and you get to see further a field because the tour knows where to take you rather than you having to research and arrange personal travel",True,False,False,,,0,1575188883,,1575189222,0,{},f999vix,False,t3_e4cogf,False,True,t3_e4cogf,/r/Cruise/comments/e4cogf/prices/f999vix/,False,,1584188596,1,True,False,Cruise,t5_2qm8s,r/Cruise,public,0,

I'm getting a massive payrise next year, about £1000+, agreed by a Tory government which actually for once looked after the lowest paid (provoking the higher paid NHS workers to threaten the deal and hold it up for a few months while the unions threw their dummies out of the pram). 

It would be political suicide for anyone to actually threaten the NHS; there are problems (stemming from the fact that no-one pays directly for care, the system regularly gets overwhelmed, and most European countries have some form of pooled-risk insurance systems that provide good coverage at an equitable standard) but when you are at the coalface, all the 'Tories are trying to privatise the NHS' bollocks is a bit laughable.

Hence why I actually and fundamentally *don't care*. And I live in this country and know exactly what's going on. My husband had fabulous care while he was alive, we have a very caring hospice service for when he died, and if you sat in my office for a day or two you'd see how the whole shebang holds together despite the comings and goings of politicians. It works. Every system has its downsides and upsides; the American system is a mirror image of ours. While ours is free to all but might not be sustainable in the long run with the ever-increasing cost of advanced 21st century medicine, yours actually acknowledges the high cost of modern healthcare but can't square the equitable provision circle. It's the same problem: how to provide what is an exceedingly expensive thing as a human right. And despite what you might have heard, there are no easy answers, but neither is it evil cackling Tories vs nice cuddly Labour.

&amp;#x200B;

They were both largely pre-industrial at the time of their revolutions- China in particular felt that the need to industrialize was an existential threat they needed to overcome in order to survive in the face of western imperialism. This led both countries to overvalue hitting industrial benchmarks in a short timespan and led to a lot of bad decisions that wouldn't happen in an already-industrialized economy. Furthermore, the centralized system they both adopted was originally seen as a stopgap measure, stage one in a two stage revolution, intended to transform the capitalist state into a communist one, but it in and of itself was not the ideal that they hoped for. It was a compromise plan. Communism was envisioned as the kind of society that would follow capitalism, which itself followed feudalism. The advances of capitalism would greatly increase production, but those gains would be unevenly distributed, with the idea being that Socialism would redistribute things so that everyone could share in them.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that Russia and China jumped the gun and set off revolutions before they had really experienced the gains of capitalism at all. Both were barely out of a feudal society at the time, still having massive amounts of uneducated peasants and little industrial capacity. They didn't have enough stuff to redistribute. The centralized command economy they implemented was just them trying to play catch-up. That's why you had them ordering city dwellers to go out to work farms in the countryside or peasant farmers to try and smelt iron in their yards. They were trying to brute force the growth of their economy but just ended up creating a bunch of inefficiencies and breaking the system they already had. They may have felt that need to hurry due to their individual situations, but that's not a tenet of socialism.

&amp;#x200B;

On top of that, they entered this coming out of violent, ideologically driven revolutions. Ideological purity was demanded, meaning that they had to immediately implement huge changes like outlawing private ownership of land, stuff that massively disrupted their existing food supply. That's not a symptom of socialism, that's a symptom of ideologically driven revolutions. They tend to put violent, paranoid revolutionaries in positions of power. Even if they were good at being a revolutionary, that doesn't mean that they'll be good at being the head of government. That's why you had stuff like Mao's stupid Four Pests Campaign. Being a bad leader is not a socialist tenet. They can have good leaders, and capitalist states can have bad ones. There are plenty of examples in capitalist societies where you've had farmers wreck their soil by overfarming cash crops or had landlords ship food away to sell elsewhere while the local population starve.

&amp;#x200B;

Did I mention that both these examples are of countries with a single-party system that suffered from high corruption both before and after the revolution? None of that is inherently socialist.

&amp;#x200B;

There are plenty of examples where countries have adopted socialist ideas and succeeded. Scandanavian-style social democracy is the best known (and consistently tops the global happiness index), but there are countries that have nationalized certain industries (usually oil) around the world. Bolivia was looking like a success story until its recent right-wing coup. The term ""socialism"" encompasses a whole range of systems, and the marxist-leninism of the USSR that was adopted or adapted by the most famous communist states is just one example. With a broader definition you could even look at smaller scale implementations like farmer co-ops, worker-owned businesses, or the commons that were the basis of European agriculture prior to enclosure as all being successful forms of socialism.

&amp;#x200B;

People hear ""socialism"" and think that it means an authoritarian government with no guarantees of personal freedoms with no innovation, no markets, no surpluses, no democracy, but none of that has to be the case. All it really means deep down is your boss and/or landlord probably sucks and you should get paid more.

I should have been clearer. Undoubtedly, Christians have suffered as much as Muslims in particular ways (because we all live in the same country/region), but I do believe Muslims have had (and continue to have) it worse. 

In the Palestinian case, it's easy: they lost their country (and Palestinians are overwhelmingly Muslim). In the Lebanese case, there's a little more to be said, but even a rudimentary overview of the country's economics, as well as one of current political relations involving sects and regional powers, doesn't seem to support the narrative that Christians are a persecuted minority. For example, look at the current relations of the Christian parties: though the LF/Kataeb are opposed to Hezbollah, the FPM are allied with them. This puts Christians in a relatively comfortable position, since the strongest (Shia) Muslim faction is allied to some of them. Sure, Christians had much more power a few decades ago, but they're far from powerless today (and they're doing much better than Sunnis). Also, whenever there's a war between Israel and Lebanon, Christian areas are rarely bombed. That's a tangible benefit of being Christian. Finally, if you look at the socioeconomic standards across the sects, Christians (and Druze) are doing better than everyone else. The Shia Muslims have recently gotten a lot of help from Iran, but they (and especially the Sunnis) are still the poorest in the country.

Though I don't think Christians have had it easy, the idea that they're persecuted has about as much weight behind it as the idea that Europe is being taken over by Muslims.

Oh yeah, that's why Hitler let 300 000 British soldiers go at the battle of Dunkirk in favor of making peace with Britain, when he could have just ended the war right there. 

Or why he allowed Britain to bomb Germany for 3 months before finally retaliating.

Or why he sent numerous peace offers to Britain that were all declined, so he had to go to the Vatican to get them to reason with Britain which was a majority Christian nation, and whose peace offer was also declined by Churchill and his cabinet.

Germany's fight wasn't with Europe, it was against the international Jewry which had declared war on them and the bolsheviks which were getting ready to invade Europe and cause more genocides like the Holodomor.

In the process those agents, whose work touches every aspect of the commerce of football, got in at the ground floor to build business relationships with a new wave of non-traditional, non-European private owners of clubs attracted by the possibility football offers of moving money seamlessly, frictionlessly and almost untouchably across international borders and into the hands of private individuals in exchange for no tangibles beyond the papers used to draw up contractual agreements. That offers considerable benefits to organisations and individuals whose wealth and power, and means of maintaining them, require discretion to the point of outright secrecy. In short Portugal was open for business, and its state was soft on football corruption and tax evasion; it offered access to highly desirable Brasilian talent and the most powerful agents in the game; come the 00s it was associated with Ronaldo, the biggest brand, the biggest face, in football.

Taking this opportunity enabled Portugese-based operators to mesh with the emergently hegemonic ownership networks that are stitching up football at present, and which they have assisted in dominating the commerce of football transfers in the EU increasingly over the last 15 years.

Even Gordon Brown's modest public spector spending increases were based on taxing the results of economic growth. There's going to be zero cash for your Big Left Project. Not that it would matter, because as you can see from his enormous polling shortfall, one of two things has happened.

either:

a) refusing to take a stance on an issue of key significance to his constituents hasn't worked out the way you'd expected. Do you remember how the Lib Dems were polling when Corbyn took over? Would they have recovered and be splitting the Labour vote today if Corbyn had taken the lead on the issue? What platform would they even be running on?

or possibly:

b) the majority of the public wants no part in your Big Left Project. (This may be because the British electorate is center-right, this dream has never successfully been implemented anywhere in the world, and France literally failed to make work when they tried it just a few years ago). If that's so you've just handed government to the conservatives (and all the consequences that will entail on public services) for a decade over a whimsical utopian fantasy.

Even McDonnell admits that no party has yet recovered from being this low in the polls and that Corbyn will have to stand down if this election is lost. So there's pretty much a 99% likelihood we're gonna be hit by the quintuple whamy: a) European economic shock b) no Big Left Project ever c) Massive public sector cuts and privatisations. d) The implications for worker protections and the environment that will be the quid pro quo for the American trade deal we'll have to negotiate as a small nation with no collective clout e) Losing the Human Rights Act, environmental regulation and constitutional perks that came from EU membership.

Also what does Obama have to do with this? Obama may have gotten little done, but Gordon Brown changed the lives of millions of people at the bottom of the income scale. You seem to think there's no difference between not having your 'Big Left Project' and undending right-wing rule? Doesn't the record of austerity show exactly what costs are of throwing elections away to the right? It amazes me that you think you're championing the interests of the poor with your utopian fantasy when you've quite literally doomed them.

Bismarck's genius political skills had navigated the new German Nation into the middle of a web of tedious alliances. After the assassination, the growing military conflict caught the strings of these alliances and began pulling everyone into war. The Germans new their situation is precarious, pinched between the Russians and the French, and so they mobilized as rapidly as possible in an attempt to win the war before it began in earnest. But they were wrong, the would-be enemy had also already begun to mobilize against Germany.

Now I'm not sure where you're signing Germany with the prime cause of WWI. Was it Bismarck's treaties? It certainly wasn't the mobilization of military forces, the Ottoman Empire had everyone beat there. It certainly wasn't intention to conquer, the Germans we're trying to prevent the French and the Russians from destroying them. Maybe it's because they were the only effective power in their shitty alliance. 

Or maybe we should just blame it on the French. If they hadn't been so concerned with destroying German power, Germany would not have been forced to defend itself, Germany would not have built the Grand Army, would not have forged such a tangled web of alliances, would not have been destroyed in the first world war, would not have become the breeding ground for extremist political thought.

It's for batter spouses if US citizens. And you can apply for a green card that way.

I would document In a journal that you keep secret the days and times of all the times he mentally abuses you and quote friends who or neighbors that can testify how little he spends with the kids and how he is mentally unstable in a way. I agree he's trying to declare you mentally unfit I would from now on be very thoughtful of your actions and or get a separate phone that records maybe with a visa gift card or something you can buy at the grocery store and that way there is no trace of a phone on any receipt. And start to secretly record him during these moments he is acting out or even admits to his bad behavior.

Just because your not a citizen doesn't mean you don't have rights find a free consultation with a good lawyer look around maybe even look around at some nearest the places you busy regularly do a Google search in your nearest area next time your out Google can do that. Open up maps and search immigration lawyer. Afterward go into your Google account settings and delete your search ok so he can't find it. Do not let it on you know. 

If you can get a lock box at a bank and your own mail box at the post office that you can also pay for with a bias gift card you buy at the grocery store and all your mail that's needed to leave Willi only go to this lock box at the mail post office that you have a key for and when you do grocery shopping go check your mail. Look into these things. I hope you update soon. If you have more questions I'll try my best to answer ok. Good luck to you and no this is not ok to live like this he's a ticking time bomb either he hurts your later or leaves you later when your helpless or you can grab this situation by the horns and be in charge of your life and make it a better one for your kids. Also if you got a green card from your marriage just because you divorce doesn't mean you get kicked out I've read this multiple times the only problem is the job situation and the place to stay. See if any Family members would be willing to send you a start up loan for a apartment after you get a job.

Edited to add. I also think he's keeping the kids from her when their fighting as a way to hurt or punish her and control her to stop bothering him.

Foi assim que David Merritt descreveu seu filho Jack Merritt, de 25 anos, que foi esfaqueado até a morte em um [ataque na London Bridge, na região central de Londres](https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/internacional-50613882).

Uma mulher que também morreu no ataque, que foi descrito pela polícia como um caso de terrorismo, ainda não foi identificada. Outras três pessoas ficaram feridas.

Graduado em direito e criminologia, Merritt foi coordenador, na Universidade de Cambridge, do programa de reabilitação prisional.

O projeto Learning Together (em Português, ""aprendendo juntos"") oferece a estudantes e detentos a oportunidade de estudarem juntos, para ajudar a reduzir a reincidência. Merritt tinha um ""profundo compromisso"" com essa área, segundo pessoas que trabalharam com ele.

Uma vigília foi realizada em Cambridge, cidade de Merritt, no sábado (30), dia seguinte ao ataque. 

Em um post no Twitter que foi deletado, o pai de Merritt escreveu: ""Meu filho Jack, que foi morto neste ataque, não gostaria que sua morte fosse usada como pretexto para sentenças mais draconianas ou para deter pessoas sem necessidade"".

Em uma visita ao local do ataque, o primeiro-ministro, Boris Johnson, disse que a prática de reduzir à metade as penas de prisão e deixar infratores violentos saírem cedo ""simplesmente não está funcionando"". Ele defendeu ""endurecer sentenças"", enquanto o líder do partido trabalhista, Jeremy Corbyn, disse que ainda há perguntas a serem respondidas.

Com [eleições gerais marcadas para 12 de dezembro](https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/internacional-50214696) no Reino Unido, partidos políticos cancelaram alguns eventos no sábado. Bandeiras nos prédios do governo do Reino Unido foram hasteadas a meio mastro, como um sinal de respeito às vítimas do ataque.

A rainha Elizabeth 2ª disse em um comunicado: ""O príncipe Philip e eu ficamos tristes ao saber dos ataques terroristas em London Bridge. Enviamos nossos pensamentos, orações e simpatias mais profundas a todos aqueles que perderam entes queridos e que foram afetados pela terrível violência de ontem (sexta)"".

Amigos, familiares e aqueles que trabalharam com Merritt têm prestado homenagens.

'Bom demais para este mundo'
----------------------------

Emilee Hopper, que disse ter sido amiga de Merritt na escola, o descreveu como ""uma das pessoas mais gentis que já conheci e uma alma bonita"".

Daisy Knock disse que Merritt era ""bom demais para este mundo"".

""Ele trabalhou e acreditou em algo que um dia mudará a forma como vemos o mundo"", acrescentou.

Outra amiga disse que Merritt, graduado pela Universidade de Manchester e pela Universidade de Cambridge, era ""incrivelmente inteligente, com mais alegria de viver do que muitos da nossa idade e mais determinação em deixar sua marca no mundo"".

   Direito de imagem Reprodução/Twitter   Image caption  'Não posso acreditar que ele foi tirado de sua família dessa forma e sempre, sempre vou lembrar como ele viveu e não como ele morreu', escreveu uma amiga em rede social.       O rapper britânico Dave disse que Merritt era ""o melhor cara"" e as notícias sobre sua morte eram ""uma das coisas mais dolorosas"".

O álbum de Dave que venceu o Mercury Prize foi inspirado na terapia de reabilitação que seu irmão Christopher Omoregie recebeu enquanto cumpria pena de prisão perpétua por assassinato.

O rapper nascido em Streatham disse que Merritt ""dedicou sua vida a ajudar os outros"". E afirmou: ""foi genuinamente uma honra conhecer alguém como você"".

Dave disse que ""nunca esqueceria"" tudo o que Merritt tinha ""feito por nós"".

   Direito de imagem Getty Images   Image caption  O rapper Dave dedicou seu premiado álbum Psychodrama a seu irmão, que está na prisão   Integrantes da comunidade de justiça criminal disseram estar ""em choque profundo"" pela morte de Merritt.

A Prison Radio UK, que trabalha com prisioneiros e várias organizações para identificar os problemas mais importantes enfrentados por esse público, elogiou o jovem de 25 anos por sua ajuda com um podcast que explica leis aos presos.

""Ele era generoso com seu tempo e feliz demais em ajudar os outros. Sua vida deve inspirar a todos nós.""

O comentarista de assuntos jurídicos Joshua Rozenberg entrevistou Merritt para a BBC em fevereiro, quando ele estava trabalhando com o Learning Together no HMP Warren Hill, em Suffolk.

Rozenberg o descreveu como ""um bom jovem, dedicado a melhorar a vida das pessoas"".

Tim Storrie, advogado que também disse que conheceu Merritt em Warren Hill, disse que ele ""salvou vidas por meio de seu trabalho"".

""Seu coração aberto, sua determinação e sua fé na redenção de prisioneiros através da educação brilharam"", acrescentou.

A procuradora Audrey Ludwig disse que ""seu profundo compromisso com a educação e a reabilitação de prisioneiros foi profundamente impressionante"".

""Eu presto condolências à família dele, amigos e ao grupo de prisioneiros"", acrescentou.

O ataque
--------

O ataque começou no início da tarde da sexta-feira no Fishmongers 'Hall, no extremo norte da London Bridge, onde uma conferência sobre reabilitação de prisioneiros estava ocorrendo e da qual Khan estava participando.

Tudo começou dentro do prédio, antes de prosseguir para a ponte, onde Khan foi detido por membros do público antes de ser baleado pela polícia.

    Dois homens foram vistos segurando o agressor e um homem foi visto se afastando segurando uma faca grande que haviam recuperado.

Um homem e uma mulher foram mortos durante o ataque e três outras pessoas (um homem e duas mulheres) também ficaram feridos e estão no hospital.

O jornalista da BBC John McManus, que estava na região, disse que viu um grupo de homens brigando na ponte. A polícia então chegou e houve troca de tiros, disse ele.

""Eu estava andando pela London Bridge na parte sul em direção à parte norte. Parecia haver uma briga do outro lado da ponte, com vários homens atacando um homem. A polícia então chegou rapidamente, inclusive polícia armada, e vários tiros foram disparados em direção ao homem"", disse McManus ao canal da BBC News.

- Medicare for all will lower healtcare costs for the majority of people, freeing capital to spend on other stuff
- Higher minimum wage will lead to more spending (by individuals) and therefore a healthy economy

It's not arbitrary to look at form over different stretches of time. I'm not saying SKT's placing was wrong or anything, just that by the time playoffs rolled around they were very dominant, and had been for a while.

To be clear, I don't disagree that LCK is better than LEC, I just disagree that it's more competitive (or at least in the way you're saying) because I think SKT were the best team in Korea by a wide margin.

I think it's probably true that Korea has like 5 or 6 teams that could have come 3rd in Europe, but I still think Korea was SKT &gt; the rest, to a similar degree that Europe was G2 &gt; the rest, by Worlds. And all this wonky reasoning about scrim results and stuff is exactly the sort of nonsense we used to (rightly) ridicule western fanboys for.

The results are what matter. Maybe Damwon could have beat anyone, but maybe Fnatic in 2015 should have beat ROX tigers too. Maybe TSM could have beaten anyone except SSW in 2014. Maybe Samsung beating SKT 3-0 in 2017 was a one-in-a-thousand fluke.

But what being good at LoL means is being good at winning LoL tournaments, and the LEC has produced 2 world-class teams (in terms of results) in the last 2 years, which only share 1 player between the rosters, so the idea that it's just G2 isn't really true.

You sound like a real seeker of understanding and truth.

&gt;I'll explain like you're 5 ...and who knows, maybe you are.

Oooh, yeah, try to insult me, that'll warm me up and bolster your argument.

&gt;
&gt;First, I'll back up. You've heard of the Little Ice Age? The abnormally cool period in the 1300s and 1400s? It coincided with the Bubonic plague, which dropped Europe's populations by 1/3. With all those people dying in a largely agrarian society, farm fields went fallow, then began to tree over. Consult any historical CO2e chart - there's a downtick in atmospheric CO2 as all the trees absorb carbon. It's a leading theory as to why the Littke Ice Age happened

No it's not a leading theory. You definitely aren't studying this enough with quality sources/educational background if that's what you believe. The IPCC disagrees as well and essentially states: 

""....the timing and areas affected by the Little Ice Age suggested largely independent regional climate changes rather than a globally synchronous increased glaciation. At most, there was modest cooling of the Northern Hemisphere during the period.""

Some further reading: https://www.eh-resources.org/little-ice-age/

&gt;
&gt;Maybe you should attempt to think this through.
&gt;
&gt;Maybe you should read the study that found areas for these 500 billion trees - they are all areas outside of cities and existing agricultural land, where it's possible to grow trees. Fertilization might help in some cases, and if ya didn't know, certain Canadian provinces are already certifying carbon reductions via fertilization to improve tree growth in stands long-term.
&gt;
&gt;Yep, I definitely didn't think it through.

You haven't, here's why:

https://www.discovermagazine.com/planet-earth/we-cant-just-plant-billions-of-trees-to-stop-climate-change

Lastly, twice you've sidestepped a key problem (and many of them really....) with planting all of those trees. The emissions came from the ground and were sequestered there for millions of years. We can't sequester them back onto the surface and not have the re-release when they decay. It's just not possible. Furthermore many of these areas aren't perfect for 'trees'.

We can use trees as part of the mix to reduce CO2 but they'll always be a bomb waiting to go off. A rapid reduction to net zero emissions is needed, not ill-advised feel good measures.

The Franco-Prussian War is also fascinating, with great personalities such as Bismarck, Wilhelm I and Napoleon III, with Prussia basically crushing and humiliating France and bombarding Paris - leading to the bombastic unification of Germany at Versailles on the one hand and the bloody anarchy of the Paris Commune on the other, setting the stage for World War I.

And for a movie not directly about a war, I find the Regency Period of the UK to be extremely fascinating. A politically rather uncertain and chaotic time. With Napoleon still around, a crazy, blind and dying old king, and a drunken, immoral and irresponsible Prince Regent. But at the same time with so many young literary geniuses, like Jane Austen, Mary Shelley, Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Keats and Lord Byron all basically writing at the same time. The British Romantic Era as a whole is very fascinating, with besides its amazing literature also created a blossoming of new, progressive ideals well ahead of their time.",True,False,False,,,0,1575212006,,False,0,{},f9belsv,False,t3_e4aj8n,False,True,t3_e4aj8n,/r/movies/comments/e4aj8n/what_are_historical_events_you_want_to_be_the/f9belsv/,False,,1584227328,5,True,False,movies,t5_2qh3s,r/movies,public,0,

Boris Johnson has widened his lead over Jeremy Corbyn to 10 points, amid a further fall in support for the Brexit Party, according to a poll. 

A Savanta ComRes survey for The Sunday Telegraph puts the Conservatives on 43 per cent, a two point rise since early last week. 

Labour and the Brexit Party have each dropped by one point to 33 per cent and 4 per cent respectively, while the Liberal Democrats remained on 13 per cent. 

Writing in The Sunday Telegraph,  Sir John Curtice, the veteran psephologist, said the findings suggested that an ""apparent erosion of the Conservative position may now have come to a halt."" 

The survey of 2,025 people also demonstrated support for a tough stance on the second phase of the Brexit negotiations. 

Some 41 per cent said that if the EU and the UK fail to agree to a trade deal by the end of next year, the UK should end the transition without an agreement - compared to 27 per cent who disagreed. 

On Friday Mr Johnson confirmed that a Conservative-led government would remain in a ""state of readiness"" for a no-deal Brexit - an outcome Mr Corbyn has said must be taken off the table. 

The poll also showed that a majority of voters believed that the Conservatives would handle the economy competently. 

By contrast only 27 per cent agreed that a government led by Mr Corbyn would handle the economy competently, while 54 per cent disagreed. 

According to the survey, 70 per cent of those who voted to leave the EU currently support the Conservatives, while Labour is the most popular party among Remain voters, receiving 48 per cent of their votes.  

Around 23 per cent of those who voted Remain in 2016 are planning to vote for the Liberal Democrats. Last week Sir John warned that the Conservatives ""seemingly comfortable"" lead would ""soon be reduced if the Remain vote were to coalesce behind Labour."" 

However, 54 per cent of those intending to vote LibDem are not confident that a Labour government under Jeremy Corbyn would handle the economy competently, the Savanta ComRes poll found. 

The survey was conducted online between Wednesday and Thursday. 

The current vote shares would result in a Conservative majority of 42, according to projections by Electoral Calculus. 

The Brexit Party would not win any seats. 

On Saturday, Sir Vince Cable, the former Lib Dem leader, admitted that the party's policy to revoke the Article 50 notice period for leaving the EU, was ""a distraction and not a very helpful one.""

You’re right. The more diverse, the more time and effort is required. But it can be done. Time is the only factor.

You claim Labour want state control of everything. Labour actually want to nationalise a few key pieces of infrastructure, because they're natural monopolies anyway. Openreach, for example, already takes significant government subsidies, yet is a private profit making company. There is only one other option for broadband infrastructure and it's nowhere near competitive, so this isn't exactly a good example of free markets driving innovation and quality or whatever.

In reality, a Labour government will bring us slightly higher taxes, disproportionately affecting the well off and very wealthy, in return for much needed investment, revitalising the country and saving lives.

You are simply regurgitating propaganda you picked up from some echo chamber.... socialism has absolutely nothing to do with the ""means of production"". What it is, is a totalitarian system of governance wherein the nation's citizenry is subjugated to the extreme, with government using military force to  dominate/assume direct control over transportation, communication, the private sector, resources, property and military arms. 

What I described is consistent in all forms of socialism without exception by the way.

&gt;""Real"" socialists wouldn't call the **socialists** socialists.

Textbook 'No true scotsman' fallacy.

Also you  have no understanding of what socialism even is, making the above quoted extremely nonsensical.

&gt;There were times that Hitler also called himself a socialist.

You mean when he would explcitly say ""*I am a socialist.*"" and was the head of the socialist party using socialist tactics, socialist iconography, a socialist system of governance and socialist rhetoric ?

I guess that's just one massive coincidence. /s

&gt; he was also a notorious liar

So was Stalin, so was Mao, so was Trotsky, so was Castro, so was Chavez, so was Pol Pot..... the above quoted again exposes you as having absolutely no idea what you're talking about.

&gt;The Nazis were some sort of crazy ad hoc third way hybrid. 

You're thinking of The Third Position which never actually happened probably due to the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact leading into WWII.

They never got past national socialism ----&gt; The Third Position.

&gt; they aren't or weren't socialists

You are incorrect.

Aboriginal and indigenous are catch-all terms for First Nations, Metis and Inuit. We are distinct groups of people who have our own unique culture, heritage and way of life. 

Section 35 of the constitution act of 1982 states the aboriginal peoples of Canada are First Nations, Metis and Inuit.

Being Metis does not mean you are first nations. We are a nation of people who emerged and no longer saw ourselfs and European or First Nations. This is called ethnogenisis where two cultures merge together to form one. It is not unique to Metis it has happened all over the world  at different points in time. 

Our ancestors created this nation and it should be something we should be proud of. We respect our first nations cousins but we are not them. We are our own unique Nation. My ancestors fought for Metis rights. They fought for our identity. My last First Nation ancestor was in the 1700's after that they have identified proudly as Metis and we continue to do so.

[],,Kaitanno,,,,[],,,,text,t2_52x818ct,False,False,[],"I’ll take the points one by one in an effort to keep it concise for your time:

1. Its a common misconception that supermarkets sell firearms, it’s also a large misconception that doing so is just as easy as picking up groceries. 

In fact, getting a firearm on the deepweb is not nearly as difficult as it seems and much easier than doing it the legal way in all cases. All you need is the free downloadable browser, and the easily findable link to the deepweb wiki. From there you will find a plethora of easily accessible links to purchase illegals firearms anywhere in the world for about $200. 

2. In the USA medical malpractice and alcohol are also heavily regulated with laws. Having laws on the books generally is a bad form of argumentation for prevention, not to take a personal swipe at you by any means. When is the last time a criminal was documented saying “it was illegal so I decided I couldn’t do it.” Laws don’t actively work to prevent anything, this is a big misconception by the majority of people. Laws stand in majority as a slight *moral deterrent* and mainly for prosecution purposes.

This would also be in stark contrast to Europe as a whole. America has the highest rates of survival for ailments such as cancer, and has the most advanced and cutting edge technology for a large portion of diseases. Far higher than all of Europe combined. That’s why people from Europe come here for cancer treatment, and experimental life saving treatments for all kinds of diseases. It’s not a knock on the European medical system, it’s just the truth.

3. As for this point I’m not sure what you’re advocating. If you’re advocating for the removal of firearms from citizens I believe I already made a strong case against that in the previous comment. If you are advocating for more “common sense” measures, then why not advocate for enforcement of laws that are *already present on the books*, the data shows empirically, strict gun laws have no effect on violent crime or gun crime in America. This can also be argued for Europe as a whole. It’s a fallacy to compare the USA to one European country at a time, the reason being is that America as a whole is *correct me if I’m wrong* close to 502million km^2 and the entirety of Europe is roughly 500million km^2. The population of both Europe and America are fairly similar when compared this way as well, and the data would actually show, that for Europe as a whole, gun laws there haven’t worked well either in comparison. There’s a redditor who went through and documented all major violent crimes in European countries from Germany to France etc... before and after gun laws took place it shows that not only did they have no noticeable effect, in many cases violent crimes increased in number. 

Why everyone over there thinks that Europe is a  bastion of safety and America is the Wild West? I don’t know, you’ll have to take that up with your media companies providing you the “news”. Not as a low blow to you personally, but anyone who is privy to this knowledge thinks Europe is a joke for 1st world country standards.

4. I agree with you, there is a massive culture problem in America. Not to be insensitive, but I believe I already made this point, if you remove suicide and gang violence, gun deaths drop to a statistical anomaly in the USA. This is not meant to be a dismissive argument towards the problem, but it *is* meant to be a dismissive argument against gun control. So like I said, when the many are judged for the actions of a few, everyone loses.

People don’t want to admit it, but we have a problem with mental health and a culture problem in minority communities. Gang violence is glorified in music, movies, games, and media. It proliferates the communities where poverty is common and many times those involved believe they have no other choice. The real solution here is to invest back into these communities, bring jobs and opportunities back, and invest into their economies where small businesses can thrive again. Not to take a blow at democratic policies, but every major area where these crimes are prevalent are democratic left leaning policies that destroyed the economy, and inflated the housing price and consumer goods prices. Less jobs, more expensive housing and essentials will make any 1st world city a poverty hole. I don’t think for profit healthcare insurance is a good thing either, but I also don’t think it’s a good thing to force the working class to pay for everyone’s insurance either. We need a better way, and you’re right we need it quickly. The prison system in America in many instances here is also *for profit* which I believe is a huge issue. But once again, the people who commit the crimes are a **very predictable** group of members in the society. Namely the ones in cities where democracy has failed them.

I swear to god, I've been going on about this point for years. My wife must be getting tired of hearing me say it too. I just don't know what you can do to make this link outside of restructuring education. My big deal here is that we treat the world too simply, Elon Musk is solving the EV crisis, not a team of engineers. Jeff Bezo's invented Amazon, not teams of people working constantly to make sure it all works. It's everywhere, and it seems to create this idea that these problems are a lot easier than they are to solve. If you figure out how to work around that issue, please tell me I can't stress my agreement with you here enough.

&gt; So again you would say visiting conferences would help to get this understanding you are having?

I think you should start there and meet people, make some friends and keep up with their work (by seeing them at conferences often enough). They can tell you changes they are seeing, and the conferences will tell you changes everyone is seeing. But don't go to 100 conferences to start, pick a niche and start there. Maybe power transmission, energy transformation, or something like that until you have an idea of what's going on. 

Lignite is a nono, imo they should be using micro-grids to get basic energy going and then targeted investments to really ramp up energy. You just keep asking questions that are focused exactly on what I do, are you trying to Dox me with flattery? :P

So I specifically work in developing countries, and my current hurdle (topic?) is explaining why traditional investment is sub par and we need to rethink investment trends. This is hard for a bunch of reasons, but mostly because the big money is easiest to distribute to a few people, and those few people (big dev. firms and the like) are skilled at big jobs not a bunch of small ones. So you get a 100 MW hydro plant that requires a shit ton of infrastructure to connect everyone it services, and this makes sense because it's how the EU and US were connected and built so we know it works. But the discussion on materials to build out transmission gets glossed over, even though it's expensive compared to a bunch of solar panels and local grids which can be scaled up. 

And when you have a bunch of local grids the interconnected distribution lines are smaller, because the local -- you know what this is some electrical engineering stuff. Basically you need less copper the shorter distance you move power. So by moving the bulk of generation next to a community, you need less copper to move the energy around, and this is why I think the traditional model doesn't work as well for developing countries. Now my actions are to move expert opinion that direction, some good news is I know people at IEA that have been surprisingly sympathetic to the argument.

(Before that I worked for my dad's company part time, so I guess you could say he paid for all of it, lol). I did France and then Italy and then Greece next. I am an Ancap so I wanted to see anarchists in these places. Yes, I know they are different kinds of ""anarchists"" and not really full anarchists like us. I went to an anarchist book store in Italy and it had a lot of English books, but no Rothbard or Ancap. Like I said, I expected that, not a surprise. I went to Greece, which everyone knows is famous for its revolutionary anarchism, its economic crisis and everything going on right now. Here I found directions for a local anarchist center. I went and didn't see anybody, but it was covered in graffiti, mostly in Greek so I couldn't read it. Whatever, I started taking pictures. Then some people came out and confronted me. This should have been my first warning sign something was not right, because photography is not a crime. They were not violent, but they were not friendly, like asking who I was, what I wanted. They all spoke good English actually. Not uncommon in Greece. I said I was a tourist and an anarchist and I just wanted to take pictures. Then they got friendly and told me I should have asked first (but pictures are no NAP violation so I don't know why, but I didn't say anything) and they invited me inside. We hung out for a while and smoked hash (there is no good dank in Europe as you might find out like in Cali, everyone smokes hash with tobacco which isn't as cool as it sounds). We started talking about politics and anarchism. I was trying to talk about the state, they were like yeah no doubt the state was bad. But they wanted to talk about capitalism, capitalism this and that. This is when we started to get into a debate. I told them that what they called capitalism is different from the free market. They said capitalism is free markets. And I said I agreed. That is what I am saying. Real capitalism is free markets. And they said yes, that is what we are trying to get rid of. And I said no, but we don't even have that right now. We need more free markets. And everyone at the same time was like ""nooo"" we are anarchists, we are against capitalism. Anarchists oppose capitalism. And I said but not anarcho-capitalists. Anarcho-capitalists are the anarchists who support capitalism. I had a fanny pack (yeah, lame I know) for my camera and in that I had this yellow and black bowtie (also super lame, it was a joke but I wasnt wearing it). And I said look, these are the Ancap colors, yellow and black, like versus the communist red and black. Well, these guys had a lot of red and black in the building already so I thought they would get it. I think that is when it started to get a really bad vibe, really tense in the air. The free market thing was funny, we disagreed but I think they thought I was just confused. Everyone was uncomfortable now. Then someone said markets wont work with democracy. And I said exactly, that's it, democracy is against anarchism. And they kind of agreed, and said yes, we don't have real democracy, just governments, and we needed more democracy. I said no, we need less democracy, democracy is the enemy. And we need to end democracy to have anarchy. Then they were all like ""noooo"" again. You know that thing people do in groups when everyone all says ""nooo"" or expresses some disapproval at the same time. And one of them said ""but we do want to stop democracy"" and then they kind of spoke back and forth in Greek. I didn't really understand it. And they asked me what I meant. So I said okay, I had the floor, I was going to tell them about ancapism. And I tried to explain to them some Rothbard and Hoppe. I said the natural order in anarchy is that the best rise to the top, the market picks who is the best. They compete and are peaceful. They said what do we want instead of anarchy. I said we want private owners to own their own land and businesses, and to employ people. They said that is what we have now. I said no, it would be even better. One of the guys said it was like feudalism. And I said it is not feudalism. Eventually one of the guys spoke up and I thought he was Greek, but he spoke English perfectly so he may have not been. He said he knew what anarcho-capitalism was and that we were basically fascists. He asked me if I thought everything should be private. And I said yes. And he asked me if I thought people were unequal. And I told him yes. And that not everyone would have equal rights. I said everyone has the right to own property and not be done aggression against. But that not everyone had to be treated equally by the owners. He said what about immigrants and racism. And I said that would not happen in a free market, but yes property owners could be racist if they wanted to. They had to respect property. Then he called me a fascist again, and someone else said I was a fascist. And then they basically all started shouting fascist at me, and one of them grabbed me by the wrists. They pulled me out the door, it was up three floors, and basically drug me down the stairs on my back. It hurt really bad and I remember yelling ""you're breaking the NAP"" and things like that. ""Stop initiating force against me."" Then they kicked me around on the ground in the hallway, before they took my camera and threw me outside. I was crying and stuff, I just sat there. I was in shock because it was so sudden. Looking back there were warning signs though. I think they felt bad for me and gave the camera back, but when I looked later they stole the memory card with all of my Greek photos. So they initiated force and theft. They broke the NAP. I knew the left anarchists were not real anarchists, but I never knew they would do something that bad. I wasnt seriously hurt, just kicked around a little, lots of bruises and little cuts.

Mary Sue is thrown around as a term by people who have perhaps not realised why they dislike Rey but still like Luke, Anakin or any other action movie man. Rey is feminine, but still assertive against characters seen as males in positions of authority and this has lead to her being a ""bitch, brat, know it all, mary sue, insert your favourite gendered insult here"".

This argument is a really bad one, and it's frequently used by Disney and fans to discredit criticism about Rey and Rose as *characters* (not actors) because it has an inherent capability that makes it attractive for people who want to shut down a conversation: *it cannot be disproven*.

It's like pressing the big and red ""nuke"" button for an argument because there's nothing that can be done once the argument was made. You're not going to survive the nuclear war, so don't bother!

Seriously, think about this for a second. How could someone ever disprove something when the existence of said quality is *completely* on the person making the argument to determine? Everything someone would write as a response is immediately seen as a lie to save face, and every criticism is invalidated on the spot because someone who is sexist obviously cannot be trusted to rate a female character.

I always roll my eyes when this argument comes up as a ""weapon of mass destruction"", simply because *widespread sexism in Star Wars fandoms* is a made-up problem. And there's empirical evidence to suggest that.

There have been tons of female characters in the old EU. Jaina Solo Fel. Leia Organa became a Jedi Knight. Mara Jade Skywalker. Vesthara Khai. Asajj Ventress. Nomi Sunrider. Ahsoka Tano.

The list of even just force-sensitive female characters goes on and on. Some of them were protagonists in their book series and comics. Others were supporting characters at times. Some were antagonists. Leia Organa Solo for *most* of the old EU was in charge of the family, and she frequently told Han how foolish his ideas were.

And this might be old news, but barely a year before the release of TLJ, Jaina Solo won a fan vote *years* after she was made non-canon to be made into a black series action figure.

I'm not saying there are no idiots on the internet, but this ""criticism has to be taken with a grain of salt because she is a woman"" is just nonsense. Science Fiction had plenty of strong women and Star Wars had plenty of female force-sensitive characters who showed up Luke, Han and the others for three decades.",True,False,False,,,0,1575221273,,1575225070,0,{},f9car83,False,t3_e3vfav,False,True,t1_f999sbh,/r/StarWars/comments/e3vfav/the_mandalorian_achieves_tension_and_emotional/f9car83/,False,,1584243170,3,True,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,r/StarWars,public,0,

Then I can go on talking about my experiences possibly resulting in folks buying more Onas resulting in them then sending me more. The circle of fap!

Sadly durability is a concern with Onas, even with pricey models like the ZXY. I have to assure you this is not due to poor build quality but because of the nature of the material. Remember it's at least twice as soft as FL material. Which results in a more natural and luxurious experience but the trade off is material that's more delicate and liable to break down quicker.

Now 30 uses is a bit ridiculous for a Ona like the ZXY. Whoever told you that either doesn't have an Ona from that price range or turns into a caveman during play. You'd have to treat your ZXY pretty badly to only get 30 uses out of it. Or you got a defective toy. With reasonable use and care you're looking at between 1-4 years with Onas like the ZXY. FLs are between 5-10. So there is definitely a notable difference in durability no doubt. 

Whether this is worth it is totally down to the individual user. I can tell you that for me it's already paid for itself after only 7 uses. Honestly, I got my money's worth after the first go. I'm not saying this to over hype you, I'd never wanna do that so keep your expectations in check okay buddy. The toy just really appeals to me and my tastes. To me nothing beats pussy so if it's not available the closer I can get to that dreamy feeling the better. The ZXY absolutely nails that, hence my adoration for it. If you prefer more crazy, exciting and alien experiences like the intenser FL sleeves it might not jazz you as much.

Both FamilyTreeDNA (a DNA testing company) and GEDmatch (a 3rd party, public genealogy website where people can voluntarily upload their own results that they get from DNA test companies) have, in the past, allowed law enforcement to search its database without their users' knowledge/consent. After user backlash, they added an opt-in to their privacy settings allowing users to be invisible to police searches, but personally, I would still avoid them.

23andMe has a policy of legally challenging all law enforcement requests for information they receive, and to date have never yielded any information to such requests ([transparency report](https://www.23andme.com/transparency-report/)). Their [privacy policy](https://www.23andme.com/privacy/) states that they will never share information with insurance companies or employers. Additionally, in the US, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) makes it illegal for health insurance to base coverage on genetic information (although it doesn't extend to life/disability insurance). Participation in research is voluntary (opt in), and they won't share individual data without consent. Any non-individual data they do share with research partners (for researching treatments to genetic diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's) is anonymized and aggregated such that an individual's data can't be discerned. Since they operate in Europe, they are GDPR-compliant (General Data Protection Regulation), and because they're based in California, will soon have to be CCPA-compliant (California Consumer Privacy Act) starting next year.

AncestryDNA has a similar [privacy policy](https://www.ancestry.com/cs/privacyphilosophy) to 23andMe. They *have* yielded data to some [law enforcement requests](https://www.ancestry.com/cs/transparency), but only non-genetic data in relation to things like credit card theft - never for genetic information.

So, it depends largely on the company and how much you're willing trust it. Companies could change their policies, but not without the risk of significant damage to their reputation and business, given that people are rightfully very sensitive to the privacy of their genetic information.

I don't need figures on the EU budget; I'm fully aware we're a major contributor. Your claim is about some maligned perception emanating from Europe. There is nothing to back this up. This is emotionally charged nonsense born out of nothing but insecurity. 

Pre-referendum major EU nations thought very highly of us, and even 18 months afterwards despite taking a reputational hit we still scored well: [https://www.britishcouncil.org/sites/default/files/from\_the\_outside\_in.pdf](https://www.britishcouncil.org/sites/default/files/from_the_outside_in.pdf) 

If anything the referendum gave more cause for people to think ill of us.

&gt; I never said it was, people voted leave [for their own reasons](https://lordashcroftpolls.com/2016/06/how-the-united-kingdom-voted-and-why/). What I’m saying is that if we don’t want to play by the rules of the club, it stands to reason that we should leave the club. Our special exemptions can only breed resentment from those members which don’t benefit from them. 

Exactly. So then we are in agreement that, as you say ""*We are a thorn in the side of the project and we are holding up the federalisation of Europe""* has fuck all to do with anything or the status we enjoy within the EU. This is not a reason to leave it if all parties are happy with current arrangements. If the EU was unhappy with it there would be a concerted effort to curb those powers (which we fought for, and won under Thatcher) under threat of ejection. The fact is there wasn't because the deal, despite maybe the grumblings of some ardent super-Federalists, worked for both parties.

&gt;The problem is what was a trading bloc is now a supranational political entity run for the benefit of powerful old men in suits. Most leavers have no axe to grind with regards to harmonisation of trade and regulations and can see the good that it brings. Where it needs to stop short is it being a political body which makes no bones about its federalist aims. 

Spare me. We've already been through the fact that we had the opt-outs from the political integration. Nothing was going to happen here unless our Government passed it into law.

It's all very easy to point the finger at a singular cause to make sense of the complex problems that have arisen with the advent of globalism. If you want to point a finger do so at successive British governments who have failed to mitigate the consequences of entire industries on which towns like Hull and Sunderland were dependent going bust due to international competition. That is not the EU's fault. And I'll tell you something else, it's going to be a hell of a lot worse when the UK is utterly exposed to cheaper American and Chinese firms without the protections trading blocs like the EU afford some of our industries.

&gt;I wish no ill on anyone, however I cannot see how the EU can make people’s lives better by more interventionism. I’d be keen to get the opinion of the Greeks after the tyranny they have experienced at the hands of the EU following their economic issues.

You mean 70+ years of unprecedented peace and prosperity on the continent? Gee, I wonder how my life has been bettered by that? But yeah, you ""hope for its peaceful demise"".

But let's talk about Greece by all means, a country which cooked its books and spent YEARS misreporting economic statistics, running a deficit which was against the EU's 3% deficit rule, and then cost the EU taxpayer billions in no less than three separate bailouts. Again, Greek corruption was its undoing and while I have every sympathy in the world for ordinary Greeks, how you can blame the EU for their situation escapes me here.

&gt;The real issue I have with the EU is that it can only succeed by homogenising it’s member nations and their cultures, the nuances of which are precisely what makes Europe the great place it is to live.

brianmayforreal Wouldn't it be a dream if this man -

this hero - this immigrant - the Polish man - was the

one who finally reunited Britain ? Maybe he is the

signal that it's time to kick out Xenophobia,

Isiolationism, BREXIT, and all the lies that have

dominated our media for the last three years ? Isn't it

time to remember that we, Britain, are a nation of

foreigners ?!! That is our strength - and our pride.

Anyone see the film 'Bohemian Rhapsody' ? Se what a

poor immigrant can do for us all ? It's time, folks.

When you vote, remember that neither of the major

parties offers you the Peace and Stability of a strong

Britain allied to the most powerful alliance in the

world - Europe. Bri -- with acknowledgments to the

First source argues that migrants are a net benefit, second expands but also argues that the benefit or detriment of migrants is not very large at all, about 1%.

Even logically thinking about it, EU migrants (the largest number in the last 20 years) are generally working age, most EU nationals I know are under 45 and I've very rarely seen older Poles etc. This makes them younger on average than the British population as a whole. Also I'd imagine that they use European health insurance, so it's not like they're bleeding the NHS dry if they use it (which because they're younger, they don't as much).

We can very roughly trace the history of the speech balloon in modern comics through the European use of speech scrolls, so called because artists would put paper scrolls in paintings and paint words on them. You've likely seen these before, since they were very common in religious and historical iconography until roughly the renaissance, when realism started to become emphasised. Even after that, they remained popular in other use for another century or two.

Eventually, they started appearing in political imagery. Both of the two most important cartoonists in that era, to whom we owe a lot in modern cartoons, occasionally used speech bubbles: William Hogarth, who pioneered early political cartoons and sequential narrative in modern art, was using them as early as the 1720s; and James Gillray, who established the political cartoon as a genre later in the 18th century employed them on and off.

Meanwhile, the speech scroll evolved into the banderole on both sides of the Atlantic, also frequently for political purposes. They were very common in propaganda pieces from the time, and by the time that Gillray used them, they already worked much in the same way that they do today. There's a very famous example from the Napoleonic Wars, when Jefferson imposed an embargo on virtually all non-US ships. You can find that at the bottom of this page, which also has a great example directly above it on how speech bubbles were used in the same manner as nowadays: https://columbia1893.weebly.com/jefferson-political-cartoons.html (Note: I know nothing of the page itself, just thought the collection of images nicely displays the topic.)

Finally, we can arrive at modern comics. In this case, it was mostly popularised by early modern American comics, which featured them extensively. _The Katzenjammer Kids_ (Dirks) and _The Yellow Kid_ (Outcault) are usually considered the first modern newspaper comic strips, and they both featured extensive use of speech bubbles, which the Americans then called ""word balloons"". _The Little Bears_ (Swinnerton), _Happy Hooligan_ (Opper), and _Little Nemo_ (McCay) are other examples of popular strips in the 1890s and 1900s that made frequent use of speech bubbles. Almost all famous American comics after that used them - with a few notable exceptions such as Val Foster's _Prince Valiant_.

Europe was slower to catch on, with some exceptions. Alain Saint-Ogan, who makes a strong claim to the title of the pioneer of modern French comics, did use them a lot, as did Hergé - arguably the most famous comic artist in Europe ever. Both used them as early as in the 1920s, but they didn't become the norm until after World War II, when American comics started to become popular in Europe.",True,False,False,,,0,1575232349,,False,0,{},f9dcym0,False,t3_e4k997,False,False,t3_e4k997,/r/AskHistorians/comments/e4k997/who_invented_the_speech_bubble/f9dcym0/,False,,1584261760,7,True,False,AskHistorians,t5_2ssp3,r/AskHistorians,public,0,

There are records of the phrase being used all the way back to the 1200s but I understand that the reason it became so popular was when it was used in the time of the French Revolution to describe how the revolutionaries felt so upset that the great democratic(ish) state of Europe to their north was unwilling to publicly support them when they decided to go around executing tens of thousands of nobles and starting wars with all of the countries on their borders - the revolutionaries were apparently incensed that the UK chose to join the coalitions against them instead.

In general, though, these days it's just used as a standard phrase to describe how the French (and the Scottish) for centuries viewed England as a snivelling, wretched country which was forever taking the opposite side in the wars they fought. It's kind of more of a joke these days than anything, but it still underlines the kind of subconscious reasons why French and English people just kind of naturally don't like each other as much as they probably should - there's this base reluctance on both country's parts to refuse to let go of the past and to continue to hold old grudges against each other.

I think the right word here is ''allowed''. If something in, for example, America is legal, that means the following: the Congress and the Senate have passed the bill, which the public was informed about. The President has signed it, all the federal agencies were notified about it, and the courts, over the years, have established precedent on how that law is actually to be applied. 

On the other hand, Holocaust was planned in backroom meetings, hushed words and euphemisms left to bureaucrats to infer from vaguely worded orders. It was executed in the places no one has ever heard of, villages in the middle of nowhere.

This is, IMO, similar in nature to the chief of police of a corrupt town in a corrupt country being corrupt himself. Sure, everyone knows he's taking bribes, and  he'll probably never be prosecuted and will die in his bed rich, but that will never make the act of taking bribes legal. 

And I'll go off-topic now, but it's actually one of the great tragedies of WW2 which is rarely talked about, mostly because people don't give a shit about Germans in that context. But think about it: it was the final surrender before the tide of fascist barbarity. Stalin killed millions too, but he at least gave them trials. Bogus trials, but still a trial of some sort.

[],,SalubriousStreets,1318513774.0,,,[],,1∆,dark,text,t2_61a6d,False,False,[],"Hey! This is something I'm actually studying in my MA program and would be glad to share some of my thoughts on why you might feel that way!

The UN has three major challenges that create this perception. The first is branding, the second is understanding of the system, and the third is compliance.

1. Branding: UNICEF, Red Cross, UNDP, UNHDR, ECOSOC, and more! These are all UN programs or institutions that do lots of work like bringing aid to impoverished or in-need communities, providing assistance during disasters, fundraising for new projects, and most importantly *remaining neutral*. These programs publish their statistics, what goals they met, and what goals they need to meet very often, but they all have some big problems. No one knows they're part of the UN, because of the consistency and dryness of reporting they're not picked up by the media very often, and they do not publicize their success. For example, the Red Cross conducts aid missions all over the world, but you don't see many headlines saying ""Red Cross, a Committee Within the UN, Saved X People This Year"". Part of this is on purpose though! More media attention leads to more pressure and more expectations. Expectations which aren't met may lead to angry people who advocate their government to withdraw support for the UN. Furthermore, the UN's main clients are states, they don't generally care what we think of them because we aren't funding them, states are. So the UN is dry, dull, and broken up into tiny organs that do lots of stuff that you don't read about in the news, but that's kind of by design.
2. Understanding the System: The UN's system for creating laws and enforcing them is *really* complicated and not a lot of people understand how it works very well. Generally the international system works on something called **customary law** which is slow, but fairly effective (in my opinion). Here's an ELI5 of customary law: Every day you go to the same diner for breakfast and get the same food. Eventually the people at the counter have your breakfast ready for you when you walk in, you pay and leave. One day you walk in and don't want to have the same thing, but it's too late they already made it! You get angry at them, but they say, hey if you had a problem with us making your breakfast before you came in you should have said something! By not speaking against it you consented to this norm. Customary law is the same thing! States at the GA get up and say stuff like ""we think it's bad that drone strikes are happening without the consent of the state being bombed"". They say it over and over again until a norm is established, once that norm is established it crystallizes into customary law and becomes international law. Now when state Y wants to bomb state X with drones, but hasn't asked for consent. Guess what? They can't without the ICJ and Security Council getting involved now. If state Y complains the UN can point to the customary law and say: hey you didn't express your dissent, that means you consented to this happening. This makes it so laws form over time with consensus and states can't just pick and choose what their positions are. Overall, it's meant to be flexible, and it is! So the UN has a great deal of power in the creation of the world we live in through customary laws and norms like this!
3. Lastly, compliance is a serious problem which hurts the UN's efficacy. Speaking bluntly, the USA, Russia, and China simply do not comply with international laws when it doesn't suit them. This is because they are part of the P5 on the Security Council and don't have to. However, this is an issue that has been really exacerbated in recent years as Bush refused to justify NATO's invasion of Afghanistan, Russia refuses to acknowledge anything going on in Ukraine, and China consistently cuts it close in the South China Sea and conducts, what looks to be, a hidden genocide. I would say the biggest problem with this is not the UN though, it's the USA. The UN doesn't work if states disregard it's power and the US under Bush really just threw their dick on the table and said ""fuck justifications we can do what we want and if you ask questions then we'll just leave the UN or veto you in the Security Council"". This really damaged the UN system because other powerful member states can now say ""hey the US doesn't let anyone investigate human rights or Geneva violations in Iraq or Afghanistan, so why should we let you investigate our ""counter-terrorism"" methods in Xinjiang?"" So in short, the UN can't prevent states damaging it.

Ultimately, the UN is a system that relies on cooperation. So when we say the UN isn't working, we're often looking at the wrong things or the wrong people!

Edit because I remembered some other important stuff that I forgot to mention!

The UN is also one of the biggest depositories for treaties! So if two nations want to make peace, make a trade deal, or a defense pact, they can use the UN as a depository for their treaty. Why does that matter? Well if one party isn't holding up their end of the treaty then you can use the ICJ to try to push them to comply or punish them for not complying.

Also! Why is the UN so bad at actually getting anything in the realm of human rights accomplished? All you have to do is look at the news for this one. Trump recently pardoned a bunch of war criminals, so what does that mean for the UN? Well, now if the UN goes to China or Russia and says ""hey, about those extra judicial killings and persecution of Muslims..."" they can turn around and say ""well the US just pardoned a bunch of war criminals so if they're not complying we're not complying"". Also, look at the abuses of human rights from another perspective. The HRC is a super European institution founded by white European people. Why is that important? Asian, African, or Eurasians can turn around and tell the HRC ""listen you made all these rules without asking for ANY of our advice, how is this not just neo-colonialism?""

I agree. I don't think Asia will enjoy their immense rise though, but that's a different topic.

&gt;Some Regions in USA have as low birth rates as southern or Eastern Europe.

Yes but the USA is a united country so with a fiscal union whereas the EU isn't. So it doesn't matter. The US is having positive population growth. Certain European countries are not. And besides - Europe as a whole continent (not just individual countries) is projected to undergo demographic decline. The UK and France will escape that, but one will no longer be a member of the EU and will be almost totally aligned with the US in the future. Europe is demographically doomed and nothing will change that. The US' population will keep growing. That will bring social and ethnic friction, but the US will cope.

&gt;Who is second is also really important since EU and China if allied could already pressure America immensely...

Extremely unlikely - the EU is already unhappy with what China is doing to muslims over there/China's protectionism policies. Not to mention China's soft power has basically gone down the toilet in the last year or so. They will never ally with China. They may attempt to consolidate independence but ally?

Sounds kinda rude to say it like that, I know, but many kids become familiar with the historical nuances *after* it becoming normalised to them as a slang word which they're not going to stop using. A lot of young Europeans were introduced to the word by rap music and Tarantino movies, not racists, so obviously, in their minds, it's just not a racist word. So as long as we have this strange duality we're going to have incidents like this, like the Gwyneth Paltrow incident, like the PDP bridge, etc. where people who are totally not racist will forget themselves and use it as slang or quote a movie or something. Which becomes a whole incident because some people will then take it as racist. And yes, the exact same thing *will* happen if ""reclaimed"" gay slurs ever become as popular in modern media as the n-word has.

My point wasn't to complain that some people aren't ""allowed"" to say it, but rather to point out that as long as this duality exists and the slang use is as popular in modern media as it has been these past few decades, we're going to keep having controversial incidents and they will mostly concern innocent non-racist people.

so firstly you are pulling every right wing voter into the same box acting like they all think the same way when thats clearly false

in a two party state like the usa everyone votes for the party that represents their wishes the best and thinking the republicans are superior to the democrats in fulfilling their wishes does not mean they align 100% with it

moving on now

the best way to think about political alignment is to have left and right economic thought and authoritarian and libertarian approaches to society

id say the usa can move between center right and center left depending on if the president is a d or an r but it has fairly consistently been more libertarian than say the uk owing to 1a and 2a which the uk lacks

id also say the overton window in the uk is to the left of the usa which is demonstrated by say the presence of universal free healthcare and the widespread support of it

continuing

not gonna address all the scandals that are all over the place its not really important

u may be right about the statistics but not for the reasons you think

i actually used to be super left wing until i finished high school and never even considered conservative thought until later exposure to it the reason for this being that conservative thought is noticeably absent from our schools and universities as a whole

so it makes sense that older people who are always less educated than the new crop were raised in a time where conservative thought was fairly standard and lefty ideas were pretty unheard of

i suspect that this pattern will reverse kind of like a sine wave back to the left wing being fringe in our educational institutions

you are not the big brain contrarian you think you are bro and the fact that trump is popular even after all the shit hes done goes to show how much of a wreck a lot of the new left is since it means that you guys are worse than him

also brexit was voted on already the question wasnt ""should we stay in the eu or strike a deal then leave"" it was ""should we stay yes or no"" it doesnt matter what the deal is it has to happen regardless which is why any party that says ""ight lads lets actually leave the way we promised to leave back in 2016"" with or without a deal gets a lot of support

1560- Scottish reformation

1567 - Mary, Queen of Scotts, is imprisoned and abdicates, handing rule to her one year old son, through a series of court/church appointed regents. 

1583 - James is allowed to rule on his own. 

1589 - Anne of Denmark marries James. 

1603 - Queen Elizabeth I of England dies so James VI of Scotland also now becomes James I of England and Ireland (under English rule at this time). He moves to London

1605 - The gunpowder plot, where some Catholics try to blow up James’ parliament in London. We still celebrate it today, with fireworks and effigy burning. Really. 

1611 - King James Bible published. 

1625 - James dies and his youngest son, Charles I takes over as King. 

1638 - the National Covenant is signed in Edinburgh

1644-5- Civil war in Scotland

1649 - Charles I executed. Cromwell rules England

1650 - Charles II signs the Covenant, Cromwell invades. 

1652 - Scotland ruled by England

1658 - Cromwell dies

1660 - Charles II restored to throne. Scotland has independent rule again. 


The reformation

This is a general term for the mass conversion in Europe from Catholicism to the new, Protestant, religion in the 1500s. In general, the reformation was a switch from the Catholic tradition of a hierarchical structure, (with God speaking to the Pope, who spoke to the Cardinals and so on down the line until a priest spoke to you) to a Presbyterian system where every individual speaks directly to God, with a minister to help the congregation interpret His wishes and a group of elders governing things.  During the reign of Mary, Queen of Scots (James’ mother), things really sped up in Scotland. Although she was Catholic, the church in Scotland officially became the Kirk in 1560 and adopted a Calvinist approach to Presbyterianism under the influence of John Knox. James VI himself was brought up as Protestant, but not a Calvinist. There are, of course plenty of Catholics still practicing, just not many in positions of power.  You can imagine the atmosphere with so much religious change and zealotry around.


Calvinism

This is the spectacularly dismal strain of Christianity that came to Scotland with Knox and is still a huge part of our collective unconscious now. Basically, there are two tenants that make it unique. First, frivolity is sin, so no saints, gilding, music, etc in church or anywhere really. Second, you are probably going to hell. There are a small percentage who aren’t definitely damned from birth but nobody knows who they are and if they commit a sin, they’re off to hell too. Fun. Also, Knox and his cronies were famously misogynistic, even for their time. 


James VI/I

The podcast taught me a lot about this dude. So apart from the funky new knowledge that he’s the only European king to have written a book on demonology (and that he LOVED a good witch burning), he’s best known for having been the son of MQS (who was imprisoned when her child was very young, having probably blown up his father), having the Bible translated into English so that it was accessible to the masses, and uniting the crowns of Britain, athough the parliaments remained separate until well after his death. He also started colonising Ireland and the Americas and had a reputation for avoiding unnecessary wars so, all in all, a pretty influential guy who was generally thought of well. Anything described as “Jacobean” in history is from his era. As is the entire podcast. 


The Covenant

This is really just the reformation but in a particularly Scottish way. It started as a secret group of influential Protestants vowing to live as Presbyterians and resist the Catholic Church. They were successful and it culminated in a covenant (written promise) between Scotland and God (I don’t know how God signed it) rejecting the introduction of Church of England practices and establishing a clear division of church and state. This put the church at odds with the King (Charles I, who believed in his divine rights) and started a civil war. Something similar was happening in England at the time, with puritans, lead by Cromwell, eventually winning the English civil war and executing Charles. 


The civil war

I literally can’t even get my head around who was on what side when! Apart from anything else, Scotland, Ireland and England were all having independent civil wars and sending troops to each other on various sides. What happened in each country influenced the others. I think the main points in Scotland are that the Covenanters fought the Royalists but they all wanted a king, just not one who ruled the church. Charles I really missed this point and after Scotland rejected him, so did England (just in a more head chopping way). So Scotland didn’t like the new (Commonwealth) parliament in England either and immediately tried to restore Charles. Even while his head was still attached, this didn’t work, so they crowned his son, Charles II. This really pissed off Cromwell, who invaded Scotland and, although the country united against him, easily decimated our armies and occupied the land. It wasn’t until Charles II was restored in England that Scotland got its independence back.",True,False,False,,,0,1575253789,,1575287704,1,{'gid_2': 1},f9ex2ax,True,t3_e4iq7m,False,True,t3_e4iq7m,/r/WitchesVsPatriarchy/comments/e4iq7m/i_found_this_fascinating_podcast_literally_about/f9ex2ax/,False,,1584289655,2,True,False,WitchesVsPatriarchy,t5_p3r73,r/WitchesVsPatriarchy,public,1,

Culture is more then just the aesthetic taste and holdiays of a people. Its also ways of thinking and attitudes towards other people. While we can certainly have a myriad of cultural practices (buddihst holidays, slavic food, fuck it, indonesian architectural taste. It doesn't matter) but these cultural practices are signifiers of differences, like a flag or a border, which is something that we should seek to avoid, to prevent the many issues within the US. 

Cascadia should seek to create its own monoculture. A large portion of the issues with the US is the large cultural divisions, that leads to a divide and rule policy among the ruling elite. Its a lot easier to get people to forget about the environment or economic inequality when they can just point at the ""others"" and blame them. The solution to this is to make the nation racially colorblind (and eventually we'll become some shade of brown anyways) and create a single cascadian culture, out of the myriad cultures we have right now. Welcoming to foreigners, but the expectation is that they should seek to become Cascadian as much as possible, contributing to it but not being separate.

It's largely forgotten now but there was almost a Civil War in France in May 1958 after right-wing paratroopers took control of Corsica and invaded mainland France. They actually brought DeGaulle to power in a putsch because they believed he would support their cause but in actuality De Gaulle despised the pied noirs (European-Algerians) because they backed Pétain instead of him during WWII. De Gaulle also came to the conclusion that keeping Algeria in France would turn France into a muslim majority country due to a combination of high Arab birth-rates and the free mobility they'd inevitably enjoy as French citizens. 

One reason the Algerian war was so bloody and complicated was because Algeria had been defined as part of France in the 1848 constitution. The colonial rulers of Algeria had worked around that by denying the natives the right to vote, for instance, there was a law that held up until the 1930s that said natives couldn't vote unless they converted to Christianity. Since Algerian society was extraordinarily rural and heavily religious few natives converted on behalf of the people who waged brutal insurgencies against them in the 19th century and displaced them from many of the best lands. Still, there had been no past conception of any country or nation-state like what would come to be known as Algeria -- for better or worse, most Algerians considered themselves to be loyal subjects of the French Empire. Most of the men who would go onto found the FLN were French-Algerian soldiers who had fought for De Gaulle in WWII, in the beginning, they were actually quite moderate. They agreed to essentially leave the whites alone as long as they got independence but this didn't really please either the white population or the French establishment and things gradually escalated on both sides. The OAS (fascist pied noir group) initially tried simply to maintain French colonial control but then began branching out into the possibility of seceding from France and setting up either an Apartheid-style state or potentially seceding from an independent Algeria -- it was too late in the game to try either, but there are allegations that the CIA and Israel helped them in their attempt.  The OAS left a lasting impression on the French right with Algerian War veteran and OAS-sympathizer Jean Le-Pen going on to form the National Front (main French far-right party); it also left an impression on the Left, though not all positive, by popularizing the post-colonial discourse, in particular the works of FLN-aligned activist Frantz Fanon. 

The French-Algerian War is actually something of a misnomer because it was really a miniature French Civil War. It brought down four governments, it led to the police slaughter of 300 Algerian independence demonstrators in Paris, and it ended with a nation that had previously been considered (officially, at-least) part of the French homeland seceding with most of its white population fleeing or being expelled. Most of the muslim Algerians who fought for France either fled to France or were slaughtered/tortured by the FLN too. The civilians of native Algeria suffered the most but in the end Algeria descended into an unviable nationalist dictatorship, which descended into an equally bloody civil war against home-grown Jihadists in the 90s. The French establishment maintained a close relationship with independent Algeria and permitted Algerian immigration into France to fill alleged gaps in its labor market. It's one of those situations where an enormous amount of blood was spilled and in the end it's not clear whether it was all worth it. It seemed that the tide of history was on Algeria's side as it played the role of progressive third world nationalist state that helped third world nations protest Western economic exploitation -- but it all fell apart in the 80s.",True,False,False,,,0,1575255373,,False,0,{},f9ez6z5,False,t3_e4lf2b,False,False,t1_f9euh9z,/r/stupidpol/comments/e4lf2b/every_time_i_hear_someone_say_our_country_is_more/f9ez6z5/,False,,1584290916,7,True,False,stupidpol,t5_hitz3,r/stupidpol,public,0,

About the country, I actually move occasionally around Europe (west and east) but at the moment the packages will be getting to Israel, so the shipping is even more expensive than it is to western Europe (UK).

&amp;#x200B;

The performance boost- ah, well, honestly there are two criteria: 1) the objective performance which is kinda... bearable... atm with the Phenom(\\Athlon). At least it could be said that the pain of spending money is greater than the joy of a smoother experience:).  2) the subjective performance where it is a question of a bang for a buck. I'm sinking a certain amount of bucks anyway so this is the baseline, if instead of getting me back 1\\1 in 1$\\computing power, my already spent dollar could suddenly gain value of 1\\2 or 1\\3- I'm prepared to add more money to the ante (not 1K$ though, there is a limit even for \*my\* thriftiness) and the joy from a smoother experience+greater efficiency will trump the pain of parting with said dollar.

 Em um documento de duas páginas, a empresa Promocom Eventos e Publicidade cobrava-lhe uma indenização por nove shows que o músico, ao morrer em março de 2013, não pôde fazer.   
 “Faleceu sem atender à totalidade das obrigações assumidas”, afirmava o texto, ressaltando que “notoriamente, tais obrigações não poderão [mais] ser atendidas”.

  

 Diante do silêncio de Alexandre, a notificação se transformou em uma ação de cobrança que ainda hoje tramita na Justiça paulista. A empresa, sediada no Paraná, exige R$ 225 mil de indenização, além de uma multa de R$ 100 mil por descumprimento de contrato (valores nominais, sem correção da inflação).

  “Com a [morte do Chorão](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2014/03/1421604-primeiro-ano-da-morte-de-chorao-e-lembrado-em-homenagens-e-novo-clipe.shtml), o capital investido deixou de fazer o lucro esperado”, afirma o advogado Rodrigo Ramina de Lucca, que representa a empresa e reclama também a restituição de outros R$ 225 mil que teriam sido pagos ao músico a título de adiantamento.

 De acordo com o advogado, o contrato com a banda previa a realização de 12 shows do Charlie Brown Jr., mas apenas três foram executados.

 “Ao investir consideravelmente na contratação da banda, a empresa deixou de contratar outro artista, o qual poderia ter-lhe proporcionado a receita inerente à sua atividade”, argumentou no processo.

 Reginaldo Ferreira Lima, advogado e avô materno de Alexandre Ferreira, diz que o pedido de indenização é uma “loucura”. “Naturalmente, [o Chorão não tinha como fazer](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2013/03/1241892-carismatico-e-explosivo-chorao-amealhou-fas-e-se-envolveu-em-polemicas.shtml) os shows, ele morreu...”.

 Em petição apresentada à Justiça, o advogado sustenta que uma indenização deve decorrer de um dano causado por ato ilícito e voluntário. “É óbvio que não há como imputar qualquer ato ilícito a ele.”

 [Alexandre Magno Abrão, o Chorão, tinha 42 anos](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2013/03/1242013-analise-com-esperteza-e-prepotencia-juvenis-chorao-foi-espelho-para-fas.shtml) quando foi encontrado morto em seu apartamento, em Pinheiros, na cidade de São Paulo.

 Exames detectaram que a morte do cantor ocorreu em [decorrência de uma overdose de cocaína](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2013/04/1257501-laudo-da-policia-aponta-que-cantor-chorao-morreu-por-overdose.shtml), como a acusação fez questão de salientar em um dos documentos anexados ao processo.

 O laudo necroscópico do IML (Instituto Médico Legal) afirma que f[oram encontradas no corpo do músico 4,714 microgramas de cocaína](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2013/03/1242607-tentei-trazer-ele-de-volta-diz-ex-de-chorao-sobre-vicio-em-cocaina.shtml) por mililitro de sangue.

 Skatista profissional na categoria freestyle nos anos 1980, Chorão fundou o Charlie Brown Jr. em 1992, tendo ao longo da carreira lançado nove discos de estúdio, dois álbuns ao vivo e mais duas coletâneas.

 O nome da banda, como o próprio relatou em entrevistas, foi escolhido depois que ele atropelou uma barraca de coco em Santos, aonde morou em boa parte da vida, na qual havia um desenho do personagem criado pelo cartunista Charles Schulz.

 O “Jr” foi acrescentado como uma homenagem a uma geração formada por grupos de rock, como Planet Hemp e Suicidal Tendencies, [entre outros, da qual dizia ser filho](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2013/03/1241933-amigos-de-santos-lembram-trajetoria-de-chorao.shtml).

 Seu último show ocorreu em Camboriú (SC), em 26 de janeiro de 2013, de acordo com o livro de fotografias “Eu Estava Lá Também” (editora Realejo), um projeto do próprio [Chorão que foi retomado pelo filho](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2013/03/1246101-familiares-de-chorao-organizam-duas-missas-de-setimo-dia-para-o-cantor.shtml).

 “Lembro que a primeira foto que fiz ficou fora de foco e eu pedi para ele voltar para perto da galera, e fiz outra”, contou Alexandre, à época do lançamento, em 2017.

 No processo aberto pela Promocom Eventos, o único [herdeiro ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2015/03/1602073-familiares-criticam-peca-sobre-charlie-brown-jr.shtml)de Chorão, hoje com 29 anos, questiona não apenas o pedido de indenização e da multa, mas a própria necessidade de ressarcimento pelos valores supostamente adiantados ao vocalista.

 Xande, como é conhecido, coloca em dúvida a autenticidade do contrato, datado de 23 de outubro de 2012, que previa exclusividade para a empresa na realização ou na vendas de shows da banda ao longo de 2013 no Paraná e nas cidades de Florianópolis, Joinville e Balneário Camboriú (SC), aquela da última apresentação do grupo.

 “Não tem qualquer semelhança com a assinatura real do falecido”, diz em documento encaminhado à Justiça, no qual declara ainda não haver prova de que o pagamento alegado foi realizado, de fato.

 A Promocom Eventos afirma que a acusação de falsidade contratual é despropositada e foi feita pelo filho do líder da banda apenas para que pudesse ganhar tempo.

 “Todos os pagamentos foram documentalmente provados”, diz o advogado da empresa, que anexou ao processo uma declaração da empresária Samantha Pereira de Jesus afirmando que intermediou o contrato com Chorão e que os adiantamentos ao vocalista foram pagos, sim.

 O juiz Cláudio Teixeira Villa, da 2ª Vara Civil de Santos, deu ganho de causa à empresa, ordenando ao espólio do músico o pagamento de R$ 325 mil, considerando a restituição dos valores e a multa.

 Não concordou, contudo, com a indenização. “Do contrário, haveria enriquecimento sem causa da parte autora, que, mesmo sem remunerar o artista, receberia pelo lucro de futura e eventual venda”, afirmou o magistrado.

 A decisão, no entanto, foi anulada pelo Tribunal de Justiça, que considerou que a Promocom não conseguiu demonstrar ter feito o adiantamento ao vocalista.

 “Há de se convir que a empresa não trouxe qualquer recibo de pagamento, comprovando haver repassado os valores cobrados nesta ação ao artista”, afirmou o relator do processo, Cláudio Hamilton.

 Por determinação dos desembargadores, um laudo pericial será realizado para apurar se a letra no contrato é realmente a do vocalista. A assinatura será comparada com a de seu passaporte.

[],,natermer,1331500384.0,,green,[],,Awesome Poster,dark,text,t2_759z0,False,False,[],"The only thing 'race realists' have in their corner on IQ is that it's been proven, through twin studies, that it's a inheritable trait.   It's not really something you have a conscious control over and who raises you and the environment you are raised doesn't have a significant impact, although they only compare relatively wealthy situations in developed nations.

All traits are a mixture of inheritable and environment.

For example two traits are 'Weight' and 'Height'.

Your body chemistry and environment and behavior control your weight. It's something you can consciously control and change through behavior.  Yeah if your parents are fat you will have a tendency to be fat, but that's not a super strong tendency. It's something you can control. Some people have a easier time at not being fat then other people.

Your height, on the other hand, isn't something you can control.  You can change your diet, or exercise, and do things to help to maintain height through your adult life (you tend to get shorter as you get older), but by and large if your parents were short then chances are you are going to be short and there isn't a whole lot you can do about it.

And as it turns out the IQ is much more like height then weight.

&amp;#x200B;

But like height it's not something that is completely independent from all other factors.  If you grew up with a shitty diet and had disease and other things then chances are your growth is going to get stunted. You might have the genes to grow tall, but it doesn't mean you actually grow tall.   IQ works the same way.

&amp;#x200B;

And then there is epigenetics to consider.

[https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/obesity-epigenetics-and-gene-regulation-927/](https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/obesity-epigenetics-and-gene-regulation-927/)

&amp;#x200B;

So nobody really has a strong definition or understanding what contributes to high intelligence in human beings.  It's not traced to any sort of genetic code.  There is no 'high IQ' gene that anybody has ever identified. So while it may be that IQ is tied to DNA the only scientific evidence for it is twin studies.

However nowadays scientists have realized that pure DNA sequencing is not the only mechanism in which traits are inheritable.

&amp;#x200B;

For example you have athletics.

Most top tier athletes have genetics that allow them to have their performance. It doesn't matter how young you are, it doesn't matter how dedicated you are, it doesn't matter what training you do, or who you train under, or how you eat or anything like that...  because they have the same level of dedication plus have better genetics.  You just can't match them.  You just didn't win the genetic lotto.

However they know that athletic ability is something that is developed over multiple generations.  If you have grand parents that were very athletic and trained and competed... and then your parents were very athletic and trained and competed...   Then you will likely have the traits to be very athletic...  not just AS athletic, mind you.  You can have the genetic potential to be MORE athletic.  Be faster, stronger, better swimmers then they had the potential to ever be.

So over the generations people who were fast tend to have FASTER offspring.

The reason for this is because even though the genetic code is the same **how the genetic code is expressed changes**.  The proteins that are produced by the DNA is not just controlled by the sequence of DNA, but also the shape of the DNA.. how it's curled, how tightly different parts are wound, and things of that nature.  That can change and also can be inherited.

And there are likely other mechanisms at play also.

**So the diet of your grand parents, their behavior, their environment, and how they lived their lives before they gave birth to your parents does impact you and how your body works.  Even if you never met them and lived a completely different lifestyle.**

&amp;#x200B;

You can see this with your own eyes when you look at things like skin pigments.  African-descendants who have lived several generations in northern USA get lighter and lighter with each successive generation.   Were as many Mexicans are primarily European descendants have become very dark.  You can see them with red hair, which is a very European trait, have skin as dark as anybody's.

And it's not all due to 'race mixing'.  It's real multi-generational inheritable changes that happen due to environment.   Noticeable changes happen in less then 100 years and with generations being around 25 years each.. that means your skin color can naturally change quite significantly in less then 4-5 generations.

&amp;#x200B;

I have to say this girl was very suppotive this year. I saw her one night and she asked me to see her the next evening free of charge.
Then she sent me messages and called me everyday, without asking for anything.


That beeing said, she's 36, I'm 35 and we both have no children.
We talked a lot and I know she's looking for a husband and want a child.
She just said she would like me to give her a baby and she'll take care of everything.

Regardless of morals questions, can I be screwed if I chose to help her like in Europe where a judge can ask for a DNA test and order the guy to provide money for the child ?

Sure you can say that the plea system encourages a lot of people to accept their charges rather than try to fight it. But there is nothing to suggest that there is any significant number of innocent people who take plea deals to go to prison rather than fight it. If you look at the conviction rate it is clear that there is good reason not to go to trial...because if the state is taking you to trial they have damn good reason to pin those crimes on you. To make your argument you would have to believe that the conviction rate for plea bargainers would be significantly lower than that of those who go to trial and that is simply not logically sound. If anything a person who knows they have no chance at trial is more likely to take a plea deal, not the other way around. The reality is that their lawyers look at the evidence and say, ""Dude you're fucked, they have so much shit on you. Just plead guilty and that will turn out best for you.""

&gt; Given the cost of defending yourself in court, and the will documented penalty you incur for rejecting a plea deal and going to trial

80% of criminal cases use court appointed attorneys. They don't pay a cent. The other 20% are wealthy enough to afford their own attorney and hired one which means the cost isn't what concerns them, they just wanted the best representation (who then later tell them against their own interests of making money from the case that their best chance is to take a plea deal because the evidence is not in their favor).

&gt; In order for something to be a crime, there has to be a law forbidding it. It could be we have more criminals because we have made more things illegal...

The US does not have more things that are illegal than europe. Europe has way more restrictions. Generally laws are pretty similar across the world anyway though, no amount of difference in laws could explain those differences.

&gt;Problem: lower class people don't make a living wage

&gt;Solution: raise the minimum wage!

&gt;What Actually Happens: employers employ less lower class people, unemployment rises.

Also outsourcing, robots etc where possible. However, where that isn't possible then wages go up across the sector and some employers go bust and others adapt to the new environment and life goes on.

&gt;Problem: the rich don't pay enough taxes

&gt;Solution: raise taxes on the rich!

&gt;What Actually Happens: the rich evade the new taxes

Nah, they just pay up and then have their minions write articles about moving. Rich people are the demographic least likely to move due to tax hikes and most likely to pay their taxes because going from being rich to being in prison super sucks. Just doesn't happen.

&gt;Problem: rents are too high and landlords are exploitative

&gt;Solution: rent control!

&gt;What Actually Happens: current renters pay the same, landlords pass costs onto newer renters

They actually burn their properties down and claim the insurance because they *cannot* pass the costs on, that's what rent control means. New york in the 1970's is the poster boy for this. This only applies if the properties are bought on leverage mind you, otherwise there is a tendency to just eat losses for a while first, and then to burn the property down.

&gt;Problem: housing isn't affordable

&gt;Solution: mandate affordable housing!

&gt;What Actually Happens: developers don't build at all because they can't recoup costs with affordable housing

Yes, the actual solution is for the government to annex some land and then build the housing itself - see most of western europe post war.

The problem with incentive systems is they can be gamed but that doesn't mean government is powerless, it actually means only direct intervention - literally ""build this house here and sell it at a loss"" etc works.

&gt; Britain does not want illegal immigrants. Yet nor does it want “hostile” systems aimed at removing them. Even when hardline enforcement policies are not deporting Windrush Brits, they’re too often cruel and ineffective. “Enforced returns” are now at a record low: there were fewer than 8,000 last year.

&gt; Britain has between 500,000 and 1.2 million irregular migrants. If we leave the EU and end free movement that figure will rise, along with public demand for a policy response that actually works.

&gt; The Social Market Foundation has an answer. Instead of wastefully trying to round up unauthorised migrants for deportation, we should give them money. Money for a ticket home and the cost of setting up life there, maybe by starting a business. Whitehall officials should support them in resettlement.

&gt; This is assisted voluntary return (AVR) and it should be put at the heart of Britain’s immigration enforcement regime.

&gt; AVR schemes have been tried before on a small scale but were attacked from all sides. Anti-immigration hardliners object to handing money to people who don’t have permission to be here. Yet AVR is much cheaper than harsher methods. It costs about£3,000 to help someone return and resettle freely, or £15,000 to deport them in shackles.

&gt; My fellow supporters of liberal immigration policies often write off AVR as an attack on migrants and their rights. In fact, significant numbers of migrants are keen to go back to their home country and will do so, if offered a helping hand that they can trust.

&gt; My fellow liberals should also accept that, without a policy of completely open borders and a permanent amnesty, any country must have the means to address irregular migration — and in a way that commands public confidence.

Meanwhile Trumptard is the only person in the world taking an actual stand against them. It's sad when a man like that that's so vial is the only 'adult' in the room when it comes to these extreme threats.

Trump is the prime reason why China can encroach on half the world unmolested. Instead of providing a unified front, he's distracting the world with his antics and alienates his allies. First thing he did in office was stepping back from a huge trade agreement, leaving a void China was all to eager to fill. While the public looks at Trump tweets, China encroaches on Africa, buys power in Australia, secures trading routes all over the pacific, isolates India to ensure dominance in Asia and buys favors in Europe.

Now he takes a stand by imposing tariffs. What does China do? They transport their Huawei phones to one of their new-bought friends, put in the last chip and ship it to America tariff free. The oldest trick in the book.

Merkel on the other hand is being pragmatic. If she were to openly oppose China in any way, then she wouldn't get anywhere.

Unlikely. Seeing as how no country in Europe occupied by France actually stayed French. And how nobody would have supported a union of France and Spain. 

And comparing that to the Germany-Austria case shows either huge bias on your part or lack of history knowledge. 

It's much easier for smaller countries to be assimilated into bigger countries than for big countries to assimilate each other. And Germany did assimilate smaller countries. There was support for a united German country that included Austria and what is now Germany. Acting like it's this impossible thing that could have never happened because they're oh so extremely different is ignoring history and how relatively close it came to happening.

&gt;It never ceases to amaze me how people from 'big' countries can't understand the viewpoint of 'small' countries.

Maybe it's people from small countries that cannot understand the viewpoint of bigger territories. 

Nationality and identity is often understood by people of monocultural countries as something that is well defined and has clear boundaries and no ambiguity when in reality it's anything but. 

In the case of Spain, there are plenty of examples. Galicia could have been part of Portugal, the Crown of Aragon could have been its own country, Navarre could have been French, even Spain itself could have ended up speaking Portuguese had history gone slightly differently...

But just like parts of countries could have been their own countries, independent countries could have been parts of bigger countries. 

Why is it that Austria *has to be* a country but not Bavaria? Why can Wales be in the UK but not Ireland? It's not like Bavaria and Wales don't have their own culture and idiosyncrasies. Just because it happened the way it happened, doesn't mean it's the only way it could have gone. And recognizing that shouldn't have people up in arms.

Focusing on these two striking and critical population trends, the report considers replacement migration for eight low-fertility countries (France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, United Kingdom and United States) and two regions (Europe and the European Union). R**eplacement migration refers to the international migration that a country would need to offset population decline and population ageing resulting from low fertility and mortality rates.**

But then you also have biomass, which as non-carbon environmentally unfriendly as it may be, is cheaper and in the case of BECCS, [carbon _negative_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bio-energy_with_carbon_capture_and_storage). IPCC predicting that at around ~$85/t, it'll play a significant role in a carbon neutral future (direct air capture is falling to similar prices, but often comes in at $150/t).

I guess for me, the thing that convinced me most that current nuclear makes no sense was ironically, [MIT's nuclear department](http://energy.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/The-Future-of-Nuclear-Energy-in-a-Carbon-Constrained-World.pdf), in an incredibly biased ""interdisciplinary study"" consisting only of nuclear PhDs and reviewed only by the nuclear industry.

The first giveaway was, well, just that. All authors and reviewers were stacked, because (I assume) the study was flawed and they couldn't get other engineers to sign off on it.

The second, was that they completely ignored biomass - why? I can only assume it was inconvenient, given that it already plays a role in Europe.

But the biggest killer was that they claim to have crunched all the numbers... and on their graphs, you can see that indeed renewables are the cheapest for most grids until you're trying to squeeze the last few % of CO2 out. They then claim that rather than spend $1000/t reducing carbon further, by building bigger and bigger battery banks, and CCS gas backup etc... that you build nuclear from the start.

They had to go _that far_ to be able to make a case for it. Check New England ""optimal configurations"", Texas, UK, France - same story for all. Outside of Zhejiang, until the last few percent of CO2, not even they can make a convincing case for nuclear - and believe me, they've tried.

The problem with all this? Direct air capture, and BECCS, both allow carbon sequestration for less than what they're using to justify nuclear. An _order of magnitude_ less, in some cases. You'll never spend $1000/t building bigger battery banks for those overcast low-wind weeks when you can pay someone $100/t to ""suck emissions back out of the air for you"". And if we don't crack _that_ egg, we're pretty much doomed once more, as there are so many practices that will likely never be carbon neutral on their own terms (agriculture, flights, cement, steel, etc).

Basically, to say we must go nuclear means (a) assuming that storage goes up in price or is impossible (which means we're doomed, as our cars use as much energy as our houses) and (b) that we can never sequester carbon for a reasonable price (which means we're doomed, as people will always eat meat, to say nothing of anything else) and (c) that renewables stop falling in price - preferably 5yrs ago, as it's getting damn inconvenient for nuclear at this point.

One day, I think it'll have a place. Outside of a few niche areas though, there is **no** reason to be betting the planet on it today.

Feels a bit awkward putting my stuff on an official thread but eh, might as well give it a try. I'm choosing Constant, AKA Alice Armstrong, since I think she'd be pretty interesting to write about.

* Someone in the know would recognize her as having mostly European heritage, but might also be able to identify some traces of Native American ancestry. While she looks very young, around 10-11, her mannerisms can make her seem older, though one would probably dismiss that without further information. She doesn't seem to exercise much, judging from her low muscularity.

* Her clothes are a lot more revealing than one would expect from a girl of her age, which points to either questionable choices by her parents or her choosing her own clothes. If in a colder climate it might raise some questions as to her comfort. The symbol many of her shirts have on the front would be recognized as the symbol of Pantheon, a worldwide organization that handles the supernatural, but it's a fairly popular design. The fabric is of high quality, pointing to her family being fairly well off.

* Alice has an accent that an expert could localize to northwestern Canada/Alaska. Her language is more complex than a typical child her age and uses some words that have gone out of use in the past few years, along with a fair bit of Irish slang, but otherwise her vocabulary is on the thinner side. One could draw the conclusion she's very mature for her age, or perhaps trying to imitate an adult, especially when combined with her clothing.

* An ordinary person wouldn't notice most of the subtleties, and would probably believe she's rather precocious when looking closer, and perhaps interested in older media due to her language use. Typically those who don't know her humour her, but many also dismiss her because of how eleven-year-olds don't typically offer much in terms of intelligent conversation.

* If seen in a combat situation, an average perception of Alice might change. Even if not actively fighting, her presence on a battlefield, and the casualness with which she seems to treat it, definitely points to her being Gifted somehow. This goes double considering she doesn't have any gear beyond her normal clothes and a pair of heavy boots. In general, when meeting someone like that on a battlefield, you start running. Her eyes will tell you the same thing. The eyes of someone used to battle. People wouldn't risk engaging her unless they're very sure of themselves or just reckless.

[],,Bobby_Marks2,1387734095.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_egwvt,False,False,[],"I've been on a major classic TV and film kick for the last few years, and the answer is simple - it depends on you. If you can look past the production limitations of the bygone eras to the themes a show offers, or if you can consume media content within a mindset that recognizes historical relevance, then you will find value in old shows. If you can't do that, then time and the Seinfeld Effect will destroy any perceived value old shows may have for you.

It's also important to understand that scripted television in the 1940s-1960s was a fraction of the content we get today. Fraction of a percent even. The television was a way for the world to be brought into living rooms; it was used for news, information and education, and live-broadcast entertainment that had already been popularized by radio. It wasn't until I Love Lucy in 1951 that sitcoms arrived as a force. There weren't enough TV owners to really push cultural awareness of TV shows back then. To quote Wikipedia: ""while only 0.5% of U.S. households had a television in 1946, 55.7% had one in 1954, and 90% by 1962."" Well into the 1950s, radio dominated the broadcast format that Americans and Europeans consumed.

At the same time, I've come to the conclusion that the 1970s was a decade of shows that mostly titillated audiences without offering too much more. It was just before 1970 that detailed demographic research and analysis began to hit the industry, so my best guess is that the 70s was the guinea pig decade for shows designed by market research. Maybe it's my own personal opinion seeping into my judgement, but there just aren't many 70s shows I find worth viewing. In several cases (I Dream of Jeanie, The Brady Bunch, Charlie's Angels, The Six-Million Dollar Man, and others), 70s shows were defined by their premises and don't offer much beyond that. There are exceptions though.

Some shows I believe are worth watching:

- Star Trek goes without saying. It's fantastic science fiction, written by some of the best SF writers of the 20th century. The philosophy from episode to episode is a staple pioneered here. However, it's true value is in the way Roddenberry leveraged his characters: Spock versus Bones as an analog for the value of logic compared to the wisdom of experience. Uhura's presence as a statement about racism in the 1960s. Spock's half-human nature that makes him entirely familiar with human weakness, yet through a dedication to logic being a superior being; Spock systematically bearing the brunt of the human crew's racism (instead of the black woman who sat next to him on the bridge) as a statement about how the inferior mock those they don't understand. Trek also holds a lot of value for remaining unyielding in it's optimism for humankind - something rare in any TV era but essentially non-existent today.
- Twilight Zone. One of the best-written, best-scripted shows ever. If you were to take bets on what currently-existing TV show was still relevant 100 years from now, this would be my pick. It's a raw, exposed nerve of human behavior study, cutting right to the folly that drives the limitations of the human mind. 
- Not that old, but I've been on a Golden Girls kick lately. Old women not being a normal selling point aside, GG holds up incredibly well as comedy. 
- The Prisoner. A spy resigns, attempts to flee the country, but is kidnapped and awakes in a weird town that functions as kind of prison. He is trying to figure out why he is there, while also trying to protect the secrets that townspeople are trying to get out of him. It's like Hot Fuzz meets The Truman Show, but with James Bond and psychological torture. Classic British TV isn't for everyone, but there is nothing like this show on TV.
- If you recognize Twilight Zone's value, Rod Serling's other show (Night Gallery) is similarly fantastic (although more horror fantasy than the Kafkaesque Twilight Zone).
- Sterling had a failed western called The Loner. It failed because it was too adult-oriented and cerebral, and lacked action. It's flawed, but an interesting look at what more mature content looked like in the 60s. 
- Two 70s shows that I believe are a good microcosm of the political, moral, and ethical culture of the decade are MASH and All In The Family. MASH is pretty well represented and understood in modern culture IMO. All In The Family was one of the most powerful sitcoms ever made, because it framed the main character as a normal guy, when he was really a horrible human being who was constantly being confronted by reality and forced to grow as a person. [Here is a 75-second example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70Xtgk03l4Y) of what kind of person he was. I draw some interesting parallels between this show and the boomer-millennial generational conflict we see today.
- I don't know that I could watch all nine seasons of it today, but Little House On The Prarie is like The Sandlot of American Homesteading. 
- There is something about Hogan's Heroes that sticks with me. There was a dark comedy film in the 1950s called Stalag 17, which while funny was also a horrid look at what WWII prison camps were like. Someone in the 1970s decided, ""hey, we should strip out the drama and tragedy and war crimes, and turn it into a sitcom."" It's something that I find relatively easy to binge without having to pay close attention - like good sitcoms usually are.
- I'm not a western guy normally, but Gunsmoke is kind of American television history that can't be ignored. While Giligan's Island and Star Trek each lasted 3 seasons, Gunsmoke had an 11-year run in which it was considered one of the greatest radio dramas ever made - and then it went on to be a 20-season TV show that the Simpsons _just recently_ surpassed as the scripted show with the highest number of episodes. It features two of the only three live-action actors to portray the same character in a scripted show for 20 consecutive years (the other being Kelsey Grammer's Frasier Crane in Cheers and Frasier).",True,False,False,,,0,1575292720,,False,0,{},f9g3l1t,False,t3_e4v6nl,False,False,t3_e4v6nl,/r/television/comments/e4v6nl/what_are_some_older_tv_shows_still_worth_watching/f9g3l1t/,False,,1584312185,15,True,False,television,t5_2qh6e,r/television,public,0,

Malta needs to get money to come back, and soon.

It is a confusion based on the name similarity of Gypsies/Roma/Romanies and Romanians.

The middle east cannot be in control of its own resources because they lack the strength to keep them. The US has interfered and taken its own cut of these resources, not by directly looting them, but by imposing unequal trade deals following our military adventurism, or by bribing despots like Saddam Hussein, and sometimes both. Had the US not done these things, China and Russia would have used their own strategies to accomplish the same.

There will probably always be power struggles, and there is a whole field of study about how to keep the peace in the context of these power struggles.

These ""Status Quo"" powers would value the state of affairs and work to prevent other states from growing to dominance. In any group of 4 or more equal powers, if one grows in power, the other three force the fourth to share the power it gains or be destroyed.

cara, faz uns meses que eu parei de comer  besteira. não adoço as coisas, consumo mais frutas e verduras. tenho diminuído também a quantidade de carboidratos ruins. e te digo, acho que essa foi a melhor escolha desse ano. os benefícios (que me lembro) são:

 - perda de peso;
 - menos a gastrite e refluxo;
 - sono mais regular;
 - &gt;!cocô mais durinho e de coloração saudável!&lt;.

não sei se lembrei de todos, acho que não.

ah, além de tentar me alimentar melhor, tenho tentado cozinhar mais vezes também. até deixei de pedir coisas por ifood, hoje em dia isso raramente acontece. o que faz com que sobre mais dinheiro também.

outra coisa, além da alimentação mais saudável, comecei a tomar kombucha e (apesar de ser um amante da cafeína) tentado beber menos café, prestando mais pela qualidade e tentando diminuir a quantidade. Isso ajuda a flora intestinal e diminui um pouco a ansiedade.

finalmente, também tenho me exercitado mais (claro, isso não tem a ver com alimentação, mas acho que é uma coisa que acontece naturalmente) até comprei uma licença de um ano de um app de calistenia. sempre tento (no mínimo) fazer um alongamento no dia.

Just one.

https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/12/18661708/bernie-sanders-definition-democratic-socialism-explained

Literally googled “Bernie Sanders explains what being a socialist means.” I know you know how to do this. 

&gt;This is another nitpick but this is also false. About two thirds of Americans are insured by the private sector. I guess you could make the case that anybody receiving a subsidy is receiving ""government funded"" health insurance but if that's what you were trying to say then most Americans are being ""government funded"".

43% of all healthcare expenditures are government funded.

https://www.crfb.org/papers/american-health-care-health-spending-and-federal-budget

43% = about half. There’s no nitpick, you just need to actually look up the numbers.

&gt;It's a remarkably inaccurate view of politics to not be able to see that the governments of Sweden, Norway, etc are far closer to us than they are to being socialist nations. I have agreed like 8 times already that nothing Sanders is currently proposing would make us a socialist country; not even close. What I want to know is whether he believes that we should eventually go further.

If you already agree, then this is literally just pointless diversion. And no, it’s remarkably childlike to reduce an entire economic system down to a binary position - one that is so unresponsive that it can’t tell the difference between Something like Sweden, current America, and Bernie’s America. There’s what, literally a handful of countries *on Earth* that you could say are actually socialist according to your model? What’s the point then? It’s not telling us anything meaningful as it relates to the topic *as you’ve already agreed.*

&gt;Well, sort of. In the Netherlands and Switzerland the penalty for not having insurance is higher than the cost of insurance so they kind of make the ACA mandate look like a joke by comparison. There are also some other pretty big differences (i.e. Switzerland turned all insurance companies into non-profits and got rid of employer provided insurance) so I wouldn't just call their systems more tightly regulated versions of our system.


Nothing you’ve said here contradicts anything you’re responding to, why you feel the need to include it, I couldn’t say, because all of which could be summed up as “they have a more tightly regulated version of our system.” Which i.e. is the system that’s left 30 million without health insurance, hasn’t reduced costs for millions of Americans, brings half a million people to bankruptcy every year, and has been susceptible to republican meddling. 

&gt;""Most expensive"" isn't the greatest metric. The Netherlands and (especially) Switzerland are loaded and as a result everything is more expensive there. The Euro Health and Consumer Index has them ranked 1 and 2.

It surely is when America has the highest healthcare spending in the world and we’re trying to figure out how to reduce costs - switching to an outlier model that is the most expensive in Europe, and are already the systems we’re closest to emulating, but hasn’t worked thus far. 

&gt;Oh and Israel, Liechtenstein, Singapore, Germany, Austria, Japan, etc all allow citizens to purchase from private insurance companies. None of these systems work exactly like the US, but the dichotomy of having to go either fully public or fully private is outright false.

Do you even know what % of Germans use private health insurance? Because the answer is about 10%. Austria? Is that the country you look to when you think of an amazing health care system? Do you know how Singapore’s system actually works? Does that seem like something we should emulate to you - where the government *owns* the hospitals? If not, why even bring up examples that you wouldn’t support anyway? None of this obviates the fact that the vast majority of industrialized countries rely on government funded health insurance.

In fact, Huawei is one of the [top 4 mobile phone vendors in South America](https://gs.statcounter.com/vendor-market-share/mobile/south-america) and China’s CCBC and ICBC banks are expanding very rapidly in the region.

3. The Kirschner governments, especially Cristina Kirschner, went to great lengths to improve relations with Cuba and even went on official state visits twice, in 2009 and 2013.

4. Cristina Kirschner made a deal with Iran and covered up their involvement in the 1994 AMIA bombing. [She’s been investigated](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/05/argentina-cristina-fernandez-de-kirchner-trial-bombing) but the trial stalled when it became clear she would be back in power (she’s currently the Vice President-elect) and the lead prosecutor who investigating the AMIA bombing and the cover up, Alberto Nisman, [turned up dead](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/06/argentinian-lawyer-alberto-nisman-was-murdered-police-report-finds) the morning of the day when he was due to testify in congress, 4 days after he accused Cristina Kirschner of the cover up and claimed to have proof.

No one is claiming Nottingham Forrest are one of the biggest clubs in Europe because they had a great period under Clough. No one is claiming Linfield or Al Alhy are among the biggest clubs in the world because of their full trophy cabinets of Northern Irish and Egyptian titles. Benfica are a relatively big club but if you look at their history and fanbase it greatly outstrips how big a club most people would rank them as today in my opinion. etc etc etc

AC Milan are a good example a club risking losing some of their status as a monster club right now. Their history, trophies, fanbase etc are second to only a handful of clubs but they've been fairly shit on the pitch for a wee while now and don't have the same level of financial power they once had. They're still a monster club but that's for now the longer they spend being weak the further from that status they will slip. 

Leicester are basically the opposite of Milan. They're rising to heights their club has never been at before in recent years and while they haven't been up there long enough to be considered a truly big club it won't take *that* much longer for them to start breaking into that category if they can stay competitive at the top of a major league and in Europe. 

And likewise this is why Celtic can be questioned against some of these up and coming clubs as while you spank them in terms of history your current legacy on the pitch and financially is as a second tier European side. First tier history, second tier footballing/financial ability today and recently. The overall picture of a club is a mix of the history and the current strength in my opinion and it's just a matter of how much you favour each.

The scope of NJO was also part of the problem.  I think it was 20-something books by the time it was done?  I love Star Wars, but that's a lot of money and time, and I didn't have either at the time.  My favorite series, the X-Wing novels, only reached nine books.  (I need to read the last one, I'm confused by how it's set so far in the future, given that the characters that would carry over from earlier would be pretty old.)

Where I loved the old EU and where I hope the new EU branches out more was with the stories outside of the core characters.  No offense to Luke, Leia, and Han, but it felt like their stories got kind of formulaic (something I don't mind in the core saga, but when it's dozens of novels, that gets a bit much).  The X-Wing novels interested me because characters weren't safe, and if they had to do something like take out a Super Star Destroyer it was a major operation to it.

Stalin is by and far rejected by the majority of communists, and will continue to be as he was an uneducated autocrat that was more concerned with the continuation of the Soviet Empire than its own people.

Mao, Castro, and Guevarra too are no saints but the nuance of the individuals finds good things to admire, both in their contribution to political and military theory, as well as what they did for their countries in regards to ending the oppressive regimes that existed well before them. (Cuba still had Slavery until the Cuban Revolution, and China still embraced serfdom until Mao). However, this means that understanding the bad is good as well. 

Mao was a hard-line autocratic communist that made bad decisions separate communism (kill all sparrows) and part of the state (surveillance and secret police) of which are rejected by the majority of communists now.

Castro is a mixed bag that I can't speak to much on. His negatives I know of come in his bigotry towards LGBT in the 60s as well as his use of political prisoners and support of North Korea on principle of resisting the United States. Other than that, he seems to have been a decent leader for Cuba, though not a communist as he embraced market socialism rather than the realization of either Lenin or Marx within Cuba. It's hard to judge Castro under the influence of a near quarter century embargo.

Guevara was a warmonger that had little sympathy for those against him which in itself was awful but stands no different than the history of the US and Europe in war, especially wars of independence. Guevara is, to the left, nothing more than a dedicated tactician who held true to his beliefs of liberating colonized peoples. He simply just is. Most don't even hold him high as a figure. He's what most (aware) people view MacArthur as. A decorated man true to his beliefs that was also a piece of shit.

As for Lenin, I can't speak much on him but as I understand, the USSR vastly improved from previous serfdom standards under him and his early death (assassination) proved to prevent a holistic idea of what Lenin's USSR would truly look like (remember, he died before the USSR even industrialized). All I can say for him is he's a figure that is split for communists as the idea of autocracy vs anarchism is split and he certainly did not treat the anarchists well.

Check out some of the Situationalists such as Debord or people like Murray Bookchin (whose ideas of libertarian socialism are being recognized in Rojava as Democratic Confederalism) and Ocalan who is the leader of the movement in Rojava.

 A frase é um trecho de um funk de MC Cidinho. Dois meses depois da postagem Gustavo seria o mais jovem entre as vítimas do episódio no qual, durante uma ação policial, [nove pessoas morreram pisoteadas.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2019/12/oito-pessoas-morrem-pisoteadas-em-baile-funk-de-paraisopolis-diz-policia.shtml)  
   
 O adolescente havia ido pela terceira vez escondido da família ao baile funk da favela, conhecido como DZ7. Na noite de sábado (30), ele saiu mais uma vez com os dois amigos para o baile mais famoso da cidade.  
   
 Um dos últimos a ver o rapaz foi o primo, Arthur Sá, 16. ""Ele disse que ia no baile. Eu falei: 'Não vai, Tu, tá dando um monte de polícia por lá'"", conta. O jovem teria respondido que iria pois nem sempre a polícia aparecia para acabar com o baile.   
   
 Padrinho do rapaz, o ascensorista Roberto Oliveira diz que a família só descobria depois que o rapaz não voltava para casa que ele havia ido ao baile. Era só nessas ocasiões que o jovem dava motivo para ser repreendido.

   
 ""Vão dizer: 'ah, agora é bom. Ah, agora é santo'. Ele era bom, não é à toa que está onde está"", diz Oliveira, para quem o rapaz, sem malícia, acabou não sabendo a hora de escapar do [cerco policial ao baile](https://agora.folha.uol.com.br/sao-paulo/2019/12/feridos-e-familiares-falam-que-acao-da-pm-em-baile-funk-foi-emboscada.shtml).   
   
 Oliveira afirma que há muito preconceito de classe em relação a jovens pobres que, assim como Gustavo, buscam o lazer nesses bailes. Isso se reflete, diz ele, na forma como autoridades tratam o caso também.  
   
 ""Se fosse lá, como é mesmo?, Higienópolis, o tratamento seria diferente"", diz. ""Como disseram os Racionais MCs, da ponte para cá é diferente"", completa ele. Por cautela em relação a eventuais represálias, ele evita falar o que pensa sobre a atuação da PM. 

   
 Oliveira conta que, na manhã de domingo, a família se organizava para procurar o jovem que ainda não havia voltado para casa. ""Aí vimos ele nas imagens que foram divulgadas, em que ele estava caído no chão. A gente queria ter esperança, mas já havia muito medo de que ele estivesse morto"", disse.   
   
 Gustavo morava com a avó e a mãe, cercado por tias e primos, no Capão Redondo, no extremo sul da cidade.   
   
 O padrinho e familiares se referem a Gustavo como um menino, que, pelo riso fácil, era conhecido como ""risadinha"". ""Ele não bebia, não cantava, não dançava, só dava risada. A gente pensava: o que ia fazer em baile?"", lembra a tia, a doméstica Maria Ivonete Sá.   
   
 Segundo ela, Gustavo estudava e fazia alguns bicos, como ajudante em um mercado. ""Era só de vez em quando, para comprar as coisas dele. Mcdonalds, roupa de marca, essas coisas"", afirma.

It doesn't change anything about my point though, which is that Trump has done far more to encourage corruption in Ukraine than prevent it.

It also doesn't change the point that many of the post-Soviet structures of corruption are transnational. The Ukrainian mob and the Russian mob are not entirely the same thing, but they are inextricably connected.

**Article**:

&gt; Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Monday on ""Fox &amp; Friends"" that it’s ""very unfortunate"" that House Democrats are moving ahead with impeachment hearings this week at the same time President Trump will be holding key meetings at the NATO summit in London.

&gt; ""There is a long tradition that we support presidents when they travel overseas to do their work. For them to hold hearings back here in Washington to distract America&amp;apos;s president from his important mission overseas ... it&amp;apos;s very unfortunate,"" said Pompeo, as the House Judiciary Committee gets ready to start its public hearings on Wednesday.

&gt; He touted Trump&amp;apos;s work on successfully convincing NATO member nations to increase security spending.

&gt; ""About $130 billion in increased spending so far, several hundred billion more in increased spending over the next three or four years. This is a direct result of President Trump making it clear our expectations that the Europeans step up to secure their own people,"" said Pompeo.

&gt; COLLINS: SCHIFF WILL BE GOP&amp;apos;S &amp;apos;FIRST AND FOREMOST WITNESS&amp;apos; FOR IMPEACHMENT HEARING

&gt; Trump is set to meet Tuesday and Wednesday in London with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, who recently claimed that the U.S. appears to be ""turning its back"" on NATO.

&gt; Meantime, three days before the House Judiciary Committee is set to call witnesses to testify at a hearing regarding the possible impeachment of President Trump, their identities are being kept hidden not just from the White House, but even members of the committee itself.

&gt; Committee Chairman Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., gave the White House until Sunday evening to decide if they would like to participate in Wednesday’s hearing, and gave Trump until Friday regarding a defense at future hearings. But Nadler&amp;apos;s fellow New York Democrat and committee member Rep. Hakeem Jeffries admitted Sunday that even he still does not know who will be testifying,

&gt; CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP

&gt; All that is known so far is that there will be four witnesses, they will be constitutional law experts, and that three will be chosen by the Democratic majority and one by the Republican minority.

&gt; When asked why it could not have been two witnesses for each side, Jeffries stated, “Well that’s something to be discussed,” but then shifted to discussing the Trump appointees who previously testified before the House Intelligence Committee.

&gt; Fox News' Ronn Blitzer contributed to this report.

Jesus commanded his disciples to not preach the Gospel to Gentiles:

**Matthew 10:5-8**

""**5** These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: “Do not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans. **6** Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel. **7** As you go, proclaim this message: ‘The kingdom of heaven has come near.’ **8** Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy,\[[a](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+10&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-23426a)\] drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give.""

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, Jesus had no problem with Gentile souls perishing to the Hell

&amp;#x200B;

Later on,  Jesus called all Gentiles as Dogs:

**Matthew 15:22-28**

**""22** A Canaanite woman from that vicinity came to him, crying out, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is demon-possessed and suffering terribly.”

**23** Jesus did not answer a word. So his disciples came to him and urged him, “Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us.”

**24** He answered, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.”

**25** The woman came and knelt before him. “Lord, help me!” she said.

**26** He replied, “It is not right to take the children’s bread and toss it to the dogs.”

**27** “Yes it is, Lord,” she said. “Even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master’s table.”

**28** Then Jesus said to her, “Woman, you have great faith! Your request is granted.” And her daughter was healed at that moment.""

&amp;#x200B;

Show me one Gentile prophet/apostle from the Bible, then I'll believe that your God isn't a racist.

Besides Israel, did God ever a blessed a Gentile nation? No

The entire Old Testament talks about Israelites and it's neighbors **only**. It doesn't mention any other country like China, Central African nations, kingdoms of Western and Central Europe, India, etc. So what happened to all those nations? Didn't God created all of them according to the Bible? Why he only talks about Israel and it's neighbors? Why he doesn't mentions any gentile nations?

&amp;#x200B;

30 000 and it does sound reasonable considering the time. Not to mention that not all of Europe went to iberia either. The point is that it was a huge european coalition to stop the Ottomans and they miserably lost pathing the way for Ottoman expansion.

&gt;Lost.

More like a stale mate. Russia, Poland-Lithaunia, Austria, minor HRE nations, Venice, Portugal and Spain did not manage to give the Ottomans a deceisive defeat that would crush their power. The Ottomans did lose some provinces yes and this did hurt their power, but they still kept their position as one of the (if not the most) powerful nation in Europe.

&gt;Ottomans at best faced 1/2 of Europe.

That's still a european coalition to me. At no time in history Europe standed as a united force anyways. Not every single european nation has to contribute something for it to be a european coalition.

&gt;You can't claim superiority over Europe when you never even fought France,

That's so much nonsense. Why would the Ottomans fight a nation they were basically allied to?

&gt;which was the European military Superpower at the time and had an army the same size as Ottomans.

France had a smaller population:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_countries\_by\_population\_in\_1600](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_in_1600)

Less strategic trade nodes and an army half the size of the Ottomans.

"" When Louis XIV came to the French throne in 1661 he inherited a large but loosely organized force of about 70,000 men. ""

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French\_Royal\_Army\_(1652%E2%80%931830)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Royal_Army_(1652%E2%80%931830))

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military\_of\_the\_Ottoman\_Empire#Strength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_of_the_Ottoman_Empire#Strength)

During the Ottoman golden age, the Ottomans were even having an army that was more than 200 000 men larger than the French.

Nice dick-measuring contest, but no. In addition the Ottomans were consider to be undefeatable on land and sea. The battle of lepanto changed it in regards to the sea and the second siege of vienna in regards to land. France did not have such a view from european nations.

Martin Luther even consider the turks to be a divine punishment from god itself for the sins of christianity.

And as a bonus add ottoman military history to it. It is a train of nonstop victories against European powers. Even if the Ottomans lost a battle, they would still win the war.

The term ""far right"" is as old as fascism itself. First usage was by French scholars, who described fascism as having evolved out of the *extrême droite* (translated in English as ""far right""). This is in contrast to communism, as seen in the Soviet Union's Marxism–Leninism, which was considered a ""far left"" movement. 

Nearly all the descriptions of the far left that you tied to fascism, ""pro-big government, pro-socialism, anti-capitalist"" (not even gonna address your implication that the Left's ethical critiques of Israel's policies amount to fascist anti-semitism) are more descriptive of communism than fascism.

I'm not claiming that the current far right movement in America amounts to fascism, or that it's even that similar to the far right movement of Continental Europe in the 1930s/40s. In both cases, usage of the term is relative to the political climate of the time. The only reason I use ""far right"" or ""alt right"" here is to distinguish this new wave of intensifying social conservatism and nationalism we're seeing now from the more traditional right-wing priorities of small government and Reaganomics. There's a rift among conservatives in America right now, so to refer to all of them as simply ""the right"" is counterproductive. Just as there's a rift among the Democrats, between the moderates and the socialist-leaning folks.

I don't know why you're so hung up on this fascism thing. Just because fascism is a right-wing ideology, it doesn't mean that you, as a right-winger, are a fascist.

That must be the response to arguments about how these four by-election defeats for the Government really don't matter and won't soon feed into the big picture of a general election effectively just weeks away.

&gt;Reality is that Fine Gael was royally stuffed in four diverse constituencies and it is very probably a harbinger of what is to come in the big one next year. Right, Leo Varadkar is telling us how these outings are a poor sideshow, the best we got was one in three voters bothering to turn out and in some cases the turnout was as poor as one in four.

&gt;But Fine Gael's problems are deeper than that. It has led the Government since March 9, 2011.

&gt;Odds are that by the time we get a general election in spring/summer 2020, Enda Kenny and, since June 2017, Leo Varadkar will have been at the tiller for nine solid years. And what have we got?

&gt;Definitely Fine Gael, with a huge support role from Labour, led us on the grim road out of the economic slough of despondency in which we had found ourselves after the banking and general economic collapse in autumn 2008. And since then we have locked into the international economic pickup.


&gt;Unemployment is down - enforced emigration is no longer a reality. So in some ways we might be saying: ""All hail Fine Gael.""

&gt;But we are doing no such thing. On Friday this newspaper had the barbaric image of a 90-year-old woman on a hospital trolley. Housing for too many people is outrageously expensive. And there are other issues which have left the generality of people royally fed up.

&gt;Of course the Fine Gael strategists will tell you that we are getting too carried away here. So they lost in Cork North-Central, Dublin Fingal, Dublin Mid-West and Wexford.

&gt;They were only ever in with a shout of winning one of those, in Dublin Mid-West. When that did not happen, are we going to condemn the entire Fine Gael ship nationally? After all, government parties rarely win by-elections.

&gt;Right then, let's run those Fine Gael excuses which are being put forward. Winter weather, voter fatigue and a feeling that these votes were not entirely relevant because a general election is just months away. If you really want to plumb the depths, you can add 'The Late Late Toy Show' as an excuse for why people were reluctant to stir out at all last Friday night for the usual teatime voter rush.

&gt;But deciding not to vote is, in an odd way, a vote in itself. It says ""a plague on all your houses"", suggesting a lack of confidence in the political system generally. My focus this past weekend was especially on Dublin Mid-West. 

&gt;It's a place where the day-to-day stuff poses big challenges for working people in relation to quality of life. Against the national trend, they voted for Sinn Féin's Cllr Mark Ward, even if only one in four bothered to vote at all there.

&gt;Well, fair play to the ""Shinners"" on this one. It effectively tapped into the mood of the people between Clondalkin and Lucan, and got a coterie of people, in the shadows of the M50, to come out and vote. Even allowing for that only one in four turnout, this is what elective politics is all about.

&gt;The people of Dublin Mid-West are royally fed up. But down in the very different constituency of Wexford something different was happening.

&gt;At the tail-end of the campaign, Fine Gael candidate Verona Murphy released a defiant video claiming to have been a victim of a media-driven character assassination. Ms Murphy had been the focus of a series of controversies which epitomised the story of a successful business person assuming that all the business skills are transferable to a better foray into politics.

&gt;Well, some business skills work in the political realm. Other business skills are better left at the political door.

&gt;The case of Ms Murphy raises big questions about where Fine Gael now finds itself. She clearly sees herself as a candidate for the forthcoming general election. But many key people within the party feel she has some miles of road, both literally and figuratively, to walk before that should happen. Leo Varadkar has wisely kept his options open here - though Fine Gael HQ feels she still has potential and perhaps fears she might also field as an Independent.

&gt;So, what are the other take-away stories from these four lacklustre calls to the polls? Well, Fianna Fáil and its leader Micheál Martin gain bragging rights with wins in Cork North-Central and Wexford.

&gt;If it manages this one right, come the upcoming general election it can regain the initiative from Leo Varadkar and Fine Gael, which was rated ahead of it in a slew of recent opinion polls.

&gt;The latest survey last Sunday week put Fine Gael six points ahead of Fianna Fáil. After this brace of by-election wins, Mr Martin has launched scathing attacks on the party he is propping up in Government in efforts to reverse that trend and gain momentum.

&gt;We had begun writing about Sinn Féin's demise after poor local and European Parliament elections last May. According to opinion polls, Mary Lou McDonald's party appeared stalled, or even gone into reverse. The win for Mark Ward in Dublin Mid-West is a very welcome boost.

&gt;Its performances elsewhere were not as promising. But an extra Sinn Féin TD will do nicely and give it reasons to insist it is fighting back. Note also that Labour polled well in all four contests, suggesting that predictions of its demise may be slightly premature. Labour still exists only in pockets - and it remains defiant.

&gt;But above all, watch the Green Party, which was annihilated after coalition with Fianna Fáil from 2007 to 2011. It is now very much back in business.

&gt;The Green Party's first ever by-election win via Cllr Joe O'Brien, in Dublin Fingal, is worthy of note. And the Green vote was pretty good across the four by-election constituencies, suggesting that its strong opinion showing around 7pc is not just fluff.

&gt;Yet, the rise of the Green Party is not good news for Fine Gael. The crazy caricature of Green voters as ""blueshirt wearers with green fingertips"" is of course by definition just a caricature.

&gt;But, then again, reflect upon your friends and neighbours and see how that one chimes with you.

&gt;Anyone in Fine Gael old enough to remember the June 1977 Fianna Fáil landslide election victory may have a certain sinking feeling. Forty-plus years later the people are fed up with Leo Varadkar, and fed up with failures on health and housing. Look out Fine Gael.

[],,Grace8543,1462559939.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_xqnfv,False,False,[],"Many people think Trump is not going after the MIC.  He has been called two faced on the issue.  He has given in on some issues like troop withdraws.  But in reality, Trump separates a strong military from the industrial complex and the intell community.  Here's how he is doing it.  

The troops are tops.  They get everything they need and they are not deployed without great cause.  The MIC plan was to use 9/11 as the justification to topple the regimes of 9 middle Eastern countries in 2-5 years allowing Saudi Arabia to step into the power vacuum and taking all the destabilized territory with weak puppet leaders installed till that day came.  See the globalist ( mic is globalist) agenda consolidated regions into one country/force migration to muddy cultural differences easing the path to erasing all boundaries.  

Though the time line expanded to 20 years and 3 presidents they have toppled 7 of the 9 countries.  The last two to see regime change was to be Syria and then Iran. So the MIC wants Assad gone and Iran in rubble.  Trump is saying no.  He cant not try to implement regime change in Iran because they are a Deep State owned and operated country that exports terror.  But in the MIC plan the country was to be invaded and bombed into rubble.  Trump instead uses economic sanctions leaving infrastructure untouched so that Iran can remain a sovereign nation and a balance check to Saudi Arabia's take over.   In trying to exit Syria he is trust the Russians to balance check both Saudi Arabia, Iran and Turkey.   And the Globalists/MIC hate that because Putin wants to crush them (see his new years day speech 2 years ago).  This is why the Dems always make Russia the bad guy when its the Ukraine (globalist stronghold prior to new president Zelensky and yet to be seen which way it goes) who interfered in 2016, and strongly, for HRC.  That's always the globalist play.  They distract from their own crimes by accusing their enemies of doing what they did.  They come out of the gate hard and use their allies the press to hammer away at it.  When the accused tries to set the record straight, without a press its pretty hard to get their message out.  If they do they sound like they are just retaliating.  
The CIA is the heart and blood of the MIC.  Take them out and the MIC becomes much less virulent.  Trump is at war with the CIA!  The CIA are the SS troops of the Globalists, their elite henchmen.  They have expanded their original mandate and budget 10 times over.  They carry out the orders of the Globalists no matter how despicable.  They are involved in running drugs and human trafficking and murder for hire of any politically inconvenient patriots.  Hundreds who opposed their plan have died premature unnatural deaths in the past 5 years.  They have infiltrated the media, and every branch and level of the federal government.  Kennedy wanted to destroy the CIA.  Taking them on can be deadly.  His firing of west wing staff is often an attack on the MIC.  Refusing to attack NoKo, Russia, Iran are all attacks on the MIC.  During HRC's campaign she said if she was president she would definitely go to war with Iran.  Getting Noko and SoKo to talk is an attack on the MIC.  Ending the ""war"" in No Ko was an attack on the MIC/Globalists.  Criticising and refusing to act on CIA intell is an attack on the MIC.  The FBI was completely infiltrated by the CIA, and so was the NSA.  He has fired 20 high level directors of these 3 agencies.  ISIS was an Obama era CIA/Mossad creation to further the goal of destabilizing the middle east and forcing migration into Europe,  So attacking them and destroying the Caliphate/clearing the taken territory of ISIS strongholds was going against the MIC.

Rebuilding the American Military was an attack on the MIC.  That sounds wrong, right.  But the MIC takes orders from the Globalists and the Globalist agenda was to turn the US into a second world country, move all its wealth out and make China the new world leader.  To that end Obama allowed the military to fall behind and weaken.  He even built new military equipment out of foreign steel.  Who knows if it was good quality thick steel or light wight thin steel.  Rumors are the latter but these are just rumors. Trump had to restore the military. but that does make him pro MIC but anti MIC.  Strengthen the economy through cutting the over regulation of all industry was against the MIC/Globalists.  

Saudi Arabia was the third pillar of the /globalists.  They were American politicians handlers.  They paid for Obama to go to Harvard.  Supplied the Bushes and Clinton's with finances to run elections.  They infiltrated the congress through the Awan brothers and Hillary used that basement server without secure systems so that they could see everything she did.  But things shifted in Saudi Arabia 4 years ago when for the first time they began to stumble financially with their oil company for the first time having to sell off stock to the public.  Trump went to Saudi Arabia and at the end of the visit trump danced a war dance with the king.  The king then changed his heir to a reformer and weeks later he arrested the Saudi royal family members who worked for the globalists to control America. Upon their arrest, Trump immediately tweeted that Saudi Arabia would now be able to trade their oil company on the New York Stock exchange, thus filling the coffers of the Saudi Arabian regime.  And then the heir apparent signed reforms that went against the Imams limiting their ability to collect money and giving women rights they hadn't had.  Trump flipped them to Nationalists instead of Globalists.  Saudi Arabia and Iran have hated each other for generations and so there will still likely be a power grab and a war between them in the middle east and the US may side with Saudi Arabia, but the die was cast on that happening when Bush jr destroyed Iraq which had been the counter balance between them.  

Trump's huge arms sales overseas look like he is for the MIC, but arming countries so that they can maintain their sovereignty rather than borders being erased because they cant defend themselves is against the Globalists/MIC plan to make us all one country.  

Trump will end the CIA and decrease the size of the intell community and their infiltration into the west wing and all branches of Government.  If he survives to finish his next term, there will be no MIC.  His eventual goal is to destroy the globalists not just in the US but in Europe too.  This is why they hate him and are trying to remove him.  Their survival depends on it.  And all they have to throw at him is their interpretation of his call to Ukraine.  

Do u understand now why he said he didnt want a quid pro quo but wanted the Ukraine to choose to do the right thing on their own?  He had to know if they would remain a globalist strong hold and therefore his blood enemy or if they were turning against the Globalists and joining the revolution against them.

Some of you may know the gist of my fantasy setting by now - it’s a realm in which nature is stronger than humankind. If humans change too much of their surroundings too quickly, the wild animals unite to eliminate their new threat.

Even though Howler’s Dell looks like a small village, it’s actually the largest and the most prosperous one in the peninsula where it was settled. Thanks to the protection of the local druids, the fertile ground and the clean water of the gentle Ape Creek, the locals are well-fed and produce enough linen to trade it with other, not-so-lucky hamlets.

When I design my villages, I allow myself to escape the original structures that were present in Medieval Europe. Since Viaticum doesn’t involve a feudal society, I reject the idea that all the settlements should abide some sort of “royal” rules or common templates. While all of the villages have to be surrounded by a palisade or a wall if they hope to keep roaming beasts away, the settlers can decide for themselves how they plan to grow and organize their neighborhood. 

In some areas, it results in free, strong, united community that supports one another in the face of need. In others, the power becomes wrongfully distributed - few own a lot, or force others into obedience.

He did point out that the BoE injected funds into the economy and that he was presenting worst-case scenarios rather than projections.

(Now, mind, one could argue that he shouldn't have used the term ""recession"" if he truly *expected* the BoE to to counter it, rather talked about policy that the BoE would need to adopt, and that he should have made very explicit any separation between worst-case scenarios and expected scenarios.  But I think that he's got a point.)

&gt;Ann McElvoy: And you've been clear on the economic outcomes of Brexit, you think it's a -- I don't want to put words in your mouth on this, but...a very considerable risk in the event of no-deal""
&gt;
&gt;Mark Carney: ""It is a considerable risk in the event of no-deal.  It matters how it's managed, so transition...this is a very flexible, resilient, strong economy, but a major change, it's always better to have some period of transition, so we talked earlier about climate, which is the ultimate transition.  It's better to start early and be steady...it's similar to whatever our future relationship is going to be with Europe.  Now can I make one crucial point on Brexit which is that, so as you say, this is our day job, part of the Bank of England is worried all the time about financial stability, so when it comes to Brexit the question we have to ask ourselves is not what *might* happen but what would be the worst thing that does happen and is the core of the UK financial system ready for that and if it's ready for that, then it's ready for any upside that comes from that worst case.
&gt;
&gt;AM: I understand that but I think that the accusation that you are, uh -- and this is not my words, this is the other people -- so a doommonger, which occasionally does get attached to you.  You're quite a cheery chap today, but you are sometimes accused of being Dr. Doom on this subject.
&gt;
&gt;MC: Well, ah, ah as I said, as I said at the outset, people will...whatever position you take, there will be criticism and that's the uh, part of the job and entirely fair.
&gt;
&gt;AM: Once you try to say ""I have to give you the worst-case scenario"", that tends to be the thing that makes the headlines.
&gt;
&gt;MC: Look, it's us doing our job.  For example, I'll give you an example earlier, which is um, this is all entirely appropriate, but it's also the reality, which is that we have been preparing since...we prepared well for the referendum, in hindsight I think that's clear, and we have been preparing since the day after the referendum for the *possibility* of a hard Brexit, a so-called disorderly Brexit, and that means preparing our facilities, but it also means, really means making sure the core of the financial system is ready, and *Parliament* asked for that information.  Mkay?  So you have a couple realities, one we have to prepare the system, that's our job, people would rightly round on us if the country chooses a certain path for Brexit -- it's the country's choice --
&gt;
&gt;AM: And you hadn't done the homework.
&gt;
&gt;MC: And we haven't done the homework!  And then the financial system's part of the problem, but second thing, and if I may, is the *reason* that that information is in the public domain is *Parliament* demanded it.  Okay?  Parliament demanded and we are accountable so...
&gt;
&gt;AM: As you said in a quite tense select committee, but I suppose...
&gt;
&gt;MC: There was nothing tense about it.  It was, uh...
&gt;
&gt;AM: Maybe not on *your* side.  *laughs*
&gt;
&gt;MC: Yeah.  Well, I think it, you know, truth hurts sometimes and uh, you ask for something you get it and uh, have to deal with the reality.
&gt;
&gt;AM: So that is the point, isn't it, the truth hurts as *you* see it, you felt that you really had to prepare worst-case scenario outcomes, they weren't predictions, they were possibles and yet former Chancellor Nigel Lawson and other critics including your own predecessor, the Bank of England were saying ""you got it wrong, you were far too pessimistic about recession hitting the UK immediately after Brexit.""  Are they wrong?
&gt;
&gt;MC: Well, they are wrong, yeah.
&gt;
&gt;AM: Because?
&gt;
&gt;MC: Well, first off, ummm....what we said in the runup to ummm....the referendum is that we expected that the pound would go down sharply, that growth would slow, and inflation would rise above target.  That's exactly what happened.  Sterling's down fifteen percent relative to pre-referendum levels, inflation shot well up above target and stayed there for several years, and the economy, uh...
&gt;
&gt;AM: Growth a bit more-robust than you thought?
&gt;
&gt;MC: Well, in part because we provided massive stimulus.  So you prepare, you get the system ready, and you're ready to respond, and that's what we've done in all those circumstances.

Another bit of info for the carbon in volcanoes is that yes, they release a TON of carbon into the atmosphere, around 200 million tons a year, and the phrase “if we increase the global temperature by 1 degree f, it will be detrimental to our environment” comes from OUR emissions directly. If we release enough carbon to raise the temp by one degree, a chain reaction occurs where the natural filters like bacteria and flora die off from the extremes in the environment which leads to less filters, which makes higher temperature spikes and the process repeats until we have extremely cold winters and extremely hot summers.

Are you still looking for your home to be able to enjoy *all* of classic? If so, Ember could be the guild for you!

Ember strives to be a quality raiding guild that expects to clear all classic raid content in a time and real life efficient manner. Primary raids will be Wednesday 19:30-22:30ST (and Thursday if needed for progress), with chill sunday for older raid content in the future. Ember already has a strong core of quality players, and want to expand on it to aim for a genuine group of 40 raiders who know how and want to raid well. Leadership is experienced, and we know what is needed to clear AQ40/Naxx in the future. We are committed to making sure we as a guild are ready for the challenges to come.

Ember will have an active premade BG group to help people rank, with several members aiming for R13/14 in the future, an alt raid with a friendly guild in the new year, and an active player base who enjoys doing dungeons and playing the game.

The news is nearly always slanted. The west relies on Chinese technology; cellphone communications, routers, chipsets etc. Infrastructure is reliant on these technologies as it stands today. There has been a lot of political smoke and mirrors going on ever since America went to trade war with China. Europe has also been quizzing its relationship with Chinese manufacturers and tech companies. Some of it is genuine worry and genuine precautionary measures, but some of it is also, well, bullshit. 

If there was such an extreme scenario whereby the risks were too high to ignore - would we be using Chinese technology? Do you think your government would allow such threats? They throw people in jail for DDoSing websites - these threats cause minimal damage. It wouldn't make much sense to ignore the deep threat of having backdoored hardware across the entirety of a country, while punishing the ones that barely scratch the surface. 

Its a possibility though. And if its true its not something that hasn't or isn't being done to other countries. America has been compromising hardware for years, both domestically and internationally. This is public information, not conspiracy theories. It's well known that over the years equipment has been sent overseas that was deliberately compromised. Intelligence communities and security services already assume much of the infrastructure could or has been compromised pending a catastrophic breakdown in relations so that foreign assets can get an upper hand over potential conflict, much of it residing in the ability to control, shut down and damage power plants, water treatment plants and dams, nuclear facilities etc. If creating backdoors in routers and cellphone tower equipment (to just name two examples of Chinese tech used) is actually happening, its nothing compared to the the extent of how deep foreign actors potentially are in regards to the entirety of critical infrastructure. 

Things need to be seen from as many perspectives as possible in order to not get blown away by what you might see in the mainstream news. When you read up on American specialist units like TAO backdooring Cisco networking equipment, with pictures to boot no less, it's not hard to picture the possibility of other countries doing the same. Then again, if its happening its not something only one side (ie China) is committing too. You only hear one side of the story, until you hear of your own country doing exactly the same thing to other countries.

What I’ve learned is you can’t throw parts at a sterling and expect it to just be fixed. You’ve got to know how to close circuits, and find electrical issues, and repair the parts you already have. You need to have a good manual for it too. The internet won’t help you work on these cars either unfortunately, most people don’t even know of their existence. This makes it very hard to source parts for them.

And millions of people out the 107 billion that are thought to have lived is statistically insignificant.

&gt;No, inequality is good and reflects the merits and choices of individuals.

This is only true if people have ample opportunity to influence their own social standing. There are many policies which can help even the playing field so bright and hardworking individuals can end up better off than their parents, but almost invariably these are not inline with what (at least traditional) conservatives support. I am very interested in what Trump supporters feel in regards to these.

* Do you support tuition free or low tuition colleges? With respect to low tuition colleges I am referring to institutions where tuition is not free, but not greater than perhaps a months rent. This was the case for me as I went to the top university in continental Europe in my field.
* Do you support universal healthcare or a heavily regulated healthcare system such as the one used in Switzerland?
* Do you support public daycares? In this case I am thinking less of the parents, whom you could argue should not have had kids if they can't support them, but of the children.

What exactly is your opinion in 2 sentences? 

Honestly it's a bit hard to respond to you because the argument you are trying to make is almost completely  baseless. You seem fully hung up on HOW that article was written, and not what the article is saying. Is every poorly written article somehow some conspiratorial effort to undermine something? She's 16 years old and autistic - are you really surprised her writing skills are not on par with adults?

It also feels like you somehow take this personally, and that you can't believe she would say something like this. I'm not sure why would you think that. It feels 100% in line with her whole MO.

&gt; **Our political leaders can no longer shirk their responsibilities.**    
&gt;  
&gt;Note the last phrase in bold. What, prey tell, are their responsibilities here, to dismantle themselves? 

They are saying the political leaders need to actively fix the institutions that are ""colonial, racist, and patriarchal"". I'm not sure why you are so hung up on this. This rhetoric is EXTREMELY common in far-left circles which is inclusive of climate activists. How many times has AOC gone out and said things similar to this? Climate activism is constantly being tied back to human right and political parties. This statement is not something new nor is it surprising. 

&gt; Without that last phrase, the paragraph makes a little bit of sense, it holds together, but barely. Add back the last phrase, it falls apart, no longer congruent. 

What is your point? Are you surprised that an article mainly written by a 16 year old has some glaring logical inconsistencies? That said, although it might not make sense to you literally, you can fully understand her intent.

&gt; that last phrase in the incongruous paragraph was omitted, which would otherwise preserve the paragraph and easily expose the two incongruent phrases for what they are. Without that last phrase, the paragraph makes a little bit of sense, it holds together, but barely. Add back the last phrase, it falls apart, no longer congruent.  

Again - what is your point at all with any of this? Do you really analyze arguments and statements made by people in such a manner where you get completely lost/obsessed with minute details in sentence structure/coordination at the loss of the content itself? 

It's literally ""this sentence would make more sense here, and this one over there, and this should have led into that, etc, etc"". Like OK, i get you, maybe things could have been put together differently - but what does that have to do with anything?

&gt; In this one, the text is edited and subtitles are added. One subtitle is ""Systems Of Oppression"", immediately preceding the paragraph where the two phrases are found. These subtitles are not found in the original article on Project Syndicate. Without those two phrases, that subtitle just doesn't fit. Never mind that it was tacked on by an editor at Social Europe. 

Again - so what? It's a different article and they stylized it differently in a way that maybe made more sense? What exactly are you trying to say? The exact same language is used in both articles. 

&gt; Listen, your reading comprehension is there, or it ain't. 

In one statement she is saying we need to hold leaders accountable for dismantelling systems of oppression that lead to climate change, and in another she says they need to persuade leaders to accept science. They are not antithetical. She is suggesting that leaders need to accept science and do something about climate change, which she suggests also involves dismantelling systems of oppression.

Does it make a lot of sense? No. Are these statements i agree with? No, but i can see what she is attempting to say and is fully inline with general leftists talking points. 

&gt; ""Marxist Slogan, SJW's leftist, Mask Off"", and so forth like a bunch of brainless automatons. 

That's because that entire paragraph feels like it was literally copy pasted out of a lefitsts circle jerk. 

&gt; You all got triggered, because that's what you do, you get triggered. No amount of reasoning can get you out of that trigger. 

Honestly - you seem the most triggered out of this. All of the conspiratorial conjecture you're throwing out there to defend a shitty statement is insane. 

&gt; You set it. It's your trap. Now you're stuck, of your own doing. Or reading comprehension is there, and you see the trap. So, what will it be?

No it isn't. The point of Brexiteers is that the European Union, or European Economic Community as it was called, is no longer what we signed up for. The UK signed up for an economic pact with European nations, one that was intended to be purely economic but has dramitcally changed since. The EU now spans from economics, to immigration, to world trade, it is not what the UK initially signed up for. That is the mandate which resulted in the referendum. The idea that it is more simplified e.g, only about immigration, or only about ""dictatorship"" as you put it, is false. 

I get that you've bought in to the idea that the EU was the only thing stopping the UK from being having commercialised health care or no environmental protection, but it's not true.

This is something (emphasis mine) that I don't think is a 100% positive development.

The motivations that bring a corporation to space are not the same motivations that bring nations to space. Nations have humanitarian and scientific motivations to be in space, to study space, and to explore space. Corporations do not have these motivations; they are motivated purely by profit opportunities.

Space tourism, as described in popular science periodicals, is not viable and won't happen for ""everyday people""; the economic reality will block all but the wealthiest patrons from getting a seat on the tour spacecraft, but this is besides the point, as the environmental consequences (both in-atmosphere and in-orbit) will make the entire concept morally unacceptable.

The nature of these differing motivations will (and already has) lead to differences in mission approach and outcome. My big concern is that private missions will be messier; the corporations won't do as good a job decontaminating, they won't be as careful about the debris and junk they throw out into orbit/space, they won't be that careful or respectful of the places they explore (ex: biological sensitive places like Enceladus or Titan, etc.), and by their very nature, any discoveries or developments they make will be kept away from the public.

Consider; If NASA makes a spaceport on Mars, that port would be open to not just all American missions, but to all European, Australian, Japanese, Indian, and maybe even Russian missions too. If Northrop Grumman makes a spaceport on Mars, that port is open to Northrop only. This has obvious implications for information sharing, and building a cooperative interplanetary civilization. Specifically, it will be an institutionalized retarding of such a project. We will, effectively, be taking the problems of our current civilization with us into space. The consequences for the entire future of human civilization off the Earth are too big to ignore. This is an aspect of the 'status quo' that we need to seriously reconsider before establishing it on other planets.

Also consider; The first fully privately funded mission to the moon came out of Israel, and it crashed. The mission was carrying live tardigrades, which possibly contaminated the moon. Now, this isn't an incredibly serious problem, as tardigrades on the moon would simply desiccate, go dormant, and eventually starve to death, if the radiation doesn't break them down first. But if a similar thing happened on Europa, the contamination could potentially destroy our ability to study any untainted, unaltered, unaffected native life on that planet. This scientific loss is indescribable, and it would be entirely due to a private company trying to save money by cutting corners and doing minimal decontamination work. It would be a crime akin to murder; you can punish the perpetrator, but you can't un-contaminate the moon, just like you can't resurrect a murdered person. And just like a murder, contaminating an alien world and ruining its research purity, would be an indescribable tragedy for all mankind, both scientifically &amp; philosophically.

The Five Eyes (FVEY) is an anglophone intelligence alliance comprising Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States. These countries are parties to the multilateral UKUSA Agreement, a treaty for joint cooperation in signals intelligence.The origins of the FVEY can be traced back to the post–World War II period, when the Atlantic Charter was issued by the Allies to lay out their goals for a post-war world. During the course of the Cold War, the ECHELON surveillance system was initially developed by the FVEY to monitor the communications of the former Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc, although it is now used to monitor billions of private communications worldwide.In the late 1990s, the existence of ECHELON was disclosed to the public, triggering a major debate in the European Parliament and, to a lesser extent, the United States Congress. As part of efforts in the ongoing War on Terror since 2001, the FVEY further expanded their surveillance capabilities, with much emphasis placed on monitoring the World Wide Web.

Apparently, it's not OK to pass moral/ethical judgements on people who lived ""a long time"" ago. Exactly when the cutoff point is, nobody can seem to say. Is it OK to say people's actions/attitudes were bad in the 90's? 80's? 50's? December 4th 1949?

But I bet if I had criticised Hitler or Mussolini or Stalin, nobody would have seen that as controversial, despite the fact that Hitler was born in 1889, Mussolini in 1883 and Stalin in 1878. Shit, I bet I could have criticised FDR and the Interment of Japanese+Asian Americans, or the White Australia Policy (they had to make a special exception for black American soldiers to land in Aus during WW2) and nobody would have batted an eye.

The amount of bile that has been hurled at me is ridiculous. I would bet it's from Brits, angry that I pointed out some serious flaws in their war time cultural hero. Get over it poms.

----------------------

Winston was a fairly shit Prime Minister, though.

I mean if you're comparing him to the foolish and cowardly previous PM who wanted to appease Hitler, that's not a high bar.

He was also pretty racist, an imperialist, and partially responsible for the 1943 famine in Bengal (then part of British India, today split between India and Bangladesh) which killed 2-3 million people, as well as a number of war time atrocities against Indians.

But British people seem to overlook all this because he gave a good speech one time about fighting on the beaches.

Additionally, despite his support of liberal democracy (for Europeans/Westerners, not brown colonial subjects lmao), the Tories didn't hold any elections for a period of TEN YEARS. Hardly democratic. I could understand this if the country was literally under invasion (it was certainly bombed a lot), but it never was.

Você diz que Ancaps dão exemplos por mero achismo, logo as indagações deles seriam falsas porque são imprecisas assim o anarco-capitalismo seria impossível porque nem você ou um Ancap conseguem imaginar uma sociedade assim, beleza agora vamos fazer uma analogia e voltar para o ano 1500, se você falasse para pessoas na época que existiriam máquinas capazes de fazer cálculos com apenas 1s e 0s elas acreditariam em você? E você conseguiria prever a invenção da internet? Se ninguém consegue imaginar computadores e você não consegue prever a internet logo a internet nunca existiria né? Errado, tanto que usamos ela nesse exato momento, você não pode afirmar que algo não existiria ou não iria funcionar porque você e o próprio Ancap não conseguem imaginar soluções, quem vai procurar soluções são as pessoas.

Em outra parte do texto você fala sobre a importância de um estado e que este traz ""estabilidade"" porque senão teria horrores sendo feitos, mano, já existem horrores sendo feito como roubo legalizado que é algo chamado imposto, também tenho que te lembrar das guerras mundiais? Guerras entre reis na idade média? O fato de você estar tentando usar o argumento que existiria horrores é porque não conhece os argumentos libertários, libertarianianismo usa jusnaturalismo de direito negativo a partir do direito natural da propriedade privada, agora aqui é um erro que muita gente que não conhece os argumentos comete é achar que propriedade privada é no sentido marxista como uma casa, um carro, meios de produção, MAS NÃO É, dizer que temos o direito natural a propriedade privada é dizer que nascemos com o direito aos nossos corpos, o corpo é a propriedade privada de cada indivíduo e podemos fazer o que quiser com ele, pular, falar, discutir, e por causa desse direito natural de propriedade não podemos agredir outros, ou seja matar, roubar, etc.

Agora onde isso teria horrores? Quem tá defendendo horrores é você, ao dizer que o estado cria “estabilidade”, mas antes dessa “estabilidade” quantas pessoas morreram? Quantas foram agredidas? Quantas morreram de fome por causa de estados tirânicos? Ou quantas irão morrer futuramente em caso de guerra? Estados que existem hoje simplesmente são os estados ques sobraram e que por meio de força impõe suas leis e normas aleatórias.

Outro erro que todo mundo que tenta criticar anarco-capitalismo é usar o nome como espantalho porque tem o nome anarco, mas dizer que anarco-capitalismo é pura anarquia é a mesma coisa de dizer que a coreia do norte é democrática já que ta no nome do país, bem, a anarquia conhecida geralmente é aquela que a sociedade não teria mais governantes e governados, não existiria pessoas acima de outras, no anarco-capitalismo essa não é a premissa, lembra que eu falei que se usa o direito natural de propriedade? Logo você não poderá fazer o uso de força em indivíduos pacíficos(não to dizendo que não exista o uso de força, o uso de força é usado para pessoas que tentaram te matar, ou roubar, e paguem por crimes a partir de leis privadas), assim somente é válido contratos voluntários que não sejam contra o direito natural(escravidão não é válida) entre as pessoas, a forma mais sensata de definir o anarco-capitalismo seria capitalismo-voluntário, ou descentralismo, ou voluntarianismo-capitalista, existiria sim governos, mas agora pessoas decidem por vontade própria assinar contratos como fazer parte de um governo X, pessoas podem fazer sindicatos normalmente, leis, etc, a única diferença é que interações são voluntárias e não feitas a força.

Você gostou muito de falar sobre a praticidade empírica, aplicações e evidências de uma sociedade assim, bem se você procurar e estudar sobre os argumentos libertários irá descobrir que são objetivos e lógicos, ao usar eles como uma canvas para a criação de uma sociedade libertária tenho certeza que irá perceber que os incentivos de uma sociedade assim são melhores que as estatais, agora usando suas próprias palavras “Correlação não significa causalidade e apostar no contrario sem grande ou mesmo uma minima perspectiva sobre a aplicação pratica da ideologia(insira qualquer uma), com tamanha falta de evidencias consistentes e abundantes sobre o funcionamento de uma sociedade ESTATAL, é na verdade irracional por ser tão incerto”, podemos ver de forma empírica que os estado não consegue prover segurança, saúde, educação, falha em todas as áreas e ainda incentiva a parasitagem da sociedade, podemos concluir com todos esses dados empíricos que o estado deveria ser abolido, mas isso só é uma informação empírica.",True,False,False,,,0,1575335820,,1575336517,0,{},f9iffs3,False,t3_e572ju,False,True,t3_e572ju,/r/brasilivre/comments/e572ju/a_ideologia_e_o_movimento_anarco_capitalistas_são/f9iffs3/,False,,1584352162,6,True,False,brasilivre,t5_351wl,r/brasilivre,public,0,

Low skill migrants make low wages. If low skill migrants were of high value to the economy then they would make high wages. The idea that low skill migrants are broadly beneficial to the economy as a whole is an economic absurdity. Low skill migrants help a few niche industries ONLY.

Low skill communities of arab and n. african migrants in sweden have extremely high unemployment figures and are prodegious users of social services. Crime rates are also high. This lack of product and high consumption of welfare has broad economic impact. The idea that this can be fixed with ""accounting"" is quite obtuse IMO.

Of course ALL COUNTRIES benefit from high skill migrants. Strict rules may mean less migrants, but mostly they mean migrants with high skill instead of low skill. UAE certainly knows this: they try ENCOURAGE high skill migration.

Low skill migrants are usually low skill for a reason: IQ is 70% genetic and they are in the low IQ band and IQ correlates well with education and income.  Their children will tend toward being low IQ creating cross generational poverty. Ignoring these facts is cornerstone of every argument in favor of low-skill immigration.

One cannot MAKE it make sense that low skill migration is a good policy by using careful words. It is not. It is creating havok across the EU and doing so IN REAL TIME. One has to be completely blind not to see the immigrant slums across Europe with very few distinguished professionals among those communities.

I haven't said that.  I've said that it's better to not completely write off someone as a nazi until they declare themselves one.  That need not be direct but may be implied.  However, people are far too quick recently to jump the gun on this judgement.  Ben Shapiro being called a nazi is one good example.  It's absurd and indicative of a societal trend of being too quick to label someone you disagree with as some kind of terrible person who should be ignored.  For the record, I don't like Ben Shapiro.

&gt;Sure, like a person being a part of a Nazi group doesn't make them a Nazi, of course! 

You nailed it.  Being associated doesn't make you the same.  Explain to me how you can conclude that literally everyone at the unite the right rally was a nazi?  It's because the organizers were nazis and a number of nazi organizations showed up?  So if I go to an event organized by a black man and attended by a number of aftican-american civil-rights groups then I'm suddenly black?  Or maybe I'm just in agreement with them on the SPECIFIC issue at hand.  Nazis are terrible and stupid but a broken clock is right twice a day.

&gt;Really? But, I thought crossings were going back up? Isn't it a national emergency? Clearly Trump isn't doing a very good job. 

Projections were higher.  Overall trump's effect has been a lowered illegal crossing rate.  This is kind of off topic in any case.  And national emergency can mean a number of different things and can sometimes be used as a political tool to allocate more resourced to a key/priority issue.

&gt;And what would that look like? The US has had immigration for a long time, our culture is just fine. It's not a static thing, culture changes, people assimilate. 

The USA has had a declining birth rate in the past few decades and an increasing immigration rate. The growth of the population has not been so immigration-heavy since the civil war.  And last time it happened it was Europeans immigrating to European-heritage colonies.  Furthermore, modern communication and media makes maintaining homeland culture far more prevalent than ever before. An Italian immigrant I knew (very older, passed away a few years ago) described the change pretty well.  He said, when he came over he had to learn English and speak it as a first language quickly. He couldn't get newspapers from Italy or news programming unless he had it shipped to his house which took over a week.  He couldn't call his family regularly due to huge long distance charges.  Nowadays he noted the immigrants coming over (mostly he experienced Indian immigrants) had smartphones.  They listened to their homeland's radio, podcasts, music, news and called family daily.  These are not necessarily bad things, but it makes assimilation less likely and more difficult.  What we're seeing is more and more division between different cultures in the US.  Again, not inherently bad, but we need to learn to adjust to it.  If you scale up the rate of immigration, you will have problems.

&gt;Oh lord, people with different political opinions coming to the country?! Better go on lockdown!

You act like that's not a bad thing for stability of the nation.  Imagine this: Trump becomes president and immediately offers full citizenships to right-wing activists around the world.  As a result, the country becomes more Republican than before and even gains elements of nazism.  Is this good?  We have the most free nation on earth.  We have one of the wealthiest nations on earth.  People come here because the societies they came from were falling apart.  Do we want to bring over so many of them that the political landscape begins to resemble their homeland's more than traditional America's?  All things in moderation.

&gt;I wonder how much of that is due to rising racial resentment now being fueled by a populist, nationalist president?

* Footnote: As to opposing war in Syria . . . I think that there are military wars and CIA wars. Syria is a CIA operation. It's related to the narcotics corridor from Afghanistan through to Turkey (and then into Europe). If you cut off that corridor, the CIA loses a lot of its black budget. I could go on for days about the CIA starting as a drug running operation back in China before it was the OSS. (Look up the name Cornelius Vander Starr to see how the CIA really started and what it ACTUALLY was prior to World War II. It began as a putative insurance company called AIG. (In reality, a front for a drug running operation in Shanghai.) Why Shanghai? Since the British opened the Opium Trade in China, Shanghai was the drug capital of the world. Here's a quote from Vander Starr's Wikipedia page: ""In 2000, Mark Fritz wrote in the article entitled The Secret (Insurance) Agent Men for the Los Angeles Times: ""They knew which factories to burn, which bridges to blow up, which cargo ships could be sunk in good conscience. They had pothole counts for roads used for invasion and head counts for city blocks marked for incineration. They weren't just secret agents. They were secret insurance agents. Newly declassified U.S. intelligence files tell the remarkable story of the ultra-secret Insurance Intelligence Unit, a component of the Office of Strategic Services, a forerunner of the CIA, and its elite counterintelligence branch X-2."" . . . When Vander Starr died, his second in command took over: a man named Maurice Greenberg. It was Greenberg who personally gave Lucky Larry Silverstein insurance on the World Trade Center complex two months before the terrorist attacks. . . . Before studying this stuff, I used to think that the CIA merely dabbled in drugs (as they did with their Air America program during Vietnam, or Iran-Contra in the 1980s.) No, they started OUT as a narcotics operation in Shanghai in the early 20th century. That's what they are.

To understand what Shanghai means, see Burton Fulsom, Jr.'s book on FDR. In it, we read: ""On his mother's side, his grandfather, Warren Delano, made his money selling opium illegally to Chinese addicts. 'I don't pretend to justify the opium trade in a moral and philanthropic point of view,' Delano said, but he persisted in it even when China declared a war to stop it. When Delano finally retired to his mansion in New York, his legitimate business investments there seem to have done no better than James Roosevelt's. Strapped for cash, Delano went back to the opium trade and Sara spent several of her youthful years in China as her father rebuilt his finances.""

This comes up again in the biography of Vannevar Bush (""Endless Frontier""). Bush needed Frederick Delano to help him form the Military Industrial Complex. Of Frederic Delano, it adds: ""Delano kept diverse company. He mixed with scientists, architects and businessmen, while finding time to investigate the opium trade in Persia and Mayan ruins in the Yucatan peninsula.""

""The opium trade in Persia?""

So like his father, Warren, Frederic was ""investigating"" drug corridors.

A lot of the people associated with the early CIA were participating in the international narcotics trade and most were in China. Like John Kerry's great-grandfather. I was reading yet another book (about 19th Century financier Jay Gould) and it mentioned John Murray Forbes, the great-grandfather of Democrat John Forbes Kerry. In a biography on him we read: ""Major financial losses during panic of 1837 caused him to sail for China once again where he played a prominent role in the Opium Wars.""

The idea that he would do that is also pretty ludicrous, bare in mind he was pro-leave.  
In scenario 2, the UK revokes article 50 with the bill to do so being passed through parliament without problem. There would be some backlash from anti-EU politicians many of whom would want a third referendum, I'm not sure of what logical through line they would have but Nigel Farage had effectivity made a career out of calling for Brexit and this wouldn't stop him.

There might be some protests but they're unlikely to be violent since there is little Brexit support among the youths and the cities. As for the EU, they would accept Britain back (so far as I know they wouldn't have a choice anyway if article 50 was revoked) and they would at least publicly treat this as a good thing although I can imagine a decent number of EU members having something is a 'not more of this' attitude towards Brattain and our constant demands for special treatment.

Not to mention the political issues of ensuring that all parties agree, which is something the EU discovered when Russia shut off the natural gas in the winter. Also, ships can be cleaner than rail, as we know because ships within the borders of the US are significantly cleaner than ones that operate internationally under foreign flags. 

Also, outsourcing to other regions is absolutely not only found in a for profit system. Resources are not spread evenly throughout the world. Mines are in one area, cheap access to hydropower to convert the ore into steel is in another, populations necessary to convert the parts into a washing machine in a factory are in another, while the shipping hubs to get the product to customers is in another. To build everything locally is to ignore the massive benefits of mass production.

 Apesar do resultado ruim, a previsão do ministro Abraham Weintraub (Educação), de que o país ficaria em último lugar entre os da América do Sul acabou por não se concretizar.

 Ao fazer a afirmação há duas semanas, ele não deixou claro se estava adiantando os resultados. “Estou supondo com base em números robustos”, disse.

  Com exceção do ranking de ciências, em que aparece empatado com Argentina e Peru, o Brasil está ligeiramente à frente da Argentina em matemática e de Argentina, Colômbia e Peru em leitura.

 Aplicado pela OCDE (Organização para Cooperação e Desenvolvimento Econômico) a cada três anos, o Pisa avaliou em 2018 alunos de 15 anos de 79 países ou regiões. A prova considera Macau e [Hong Kong](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/11/cresce-o-numero-de-protestos-da-hora-do-almoco-em-hong-kong.shtml?utm_source=folha&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_campaign=topicos), territórios da China com administração própria e certo grau de autonomia, como entidades independentes.

 A organização pontua no relatório de resultados da avaliação que o Brasil avançou em matemática entre 2003 e 2018, mas a melhora ficou concentrada nos primeiros anos desse período.

 Na fase seguinte, a tendência é de estagnação. “Após 2009, em matemática, leitura e ciências, a performance parece variar em tendência estável”, diz o texto.

 O Brasil ocupa no ranking da avaliação a 42ª posição em leitura, destaque do relatório deste ano, a 58ª em matemática e 53ª em ciências.

 Além da média baixa e estagnada, chama a atenção a quantidade de alunos brasileiros abaixo do desempenho considerado mínimo. Do total de estudantes, 43% não alcançaram o nível considerado mínimo em nenhuma das áreas do conhecimento.

 A situação mais grave é a de matemática. Apenas 32% dos brasileiros atingiram o mínimo na disciplina no país, enquanto a média dos integrantes da OCDE é de 76%.

 Atingir esse patamar significa que esses estudantes conseguem, por exemplo, converter preços em diferentes moedas —algo que sabem fazer 98% dos alunos das províncias chinesas de Beijing, Xangai, Jiangsu e Zhejiang.

 Em ciências, 45% dos brasileiros chegam ao mínimo, ante média da OCDE de 78%. Eles conseguem identificar, em casos simples, quando uma conclusão é válida com base nos dados disponíveis.

 Em leitura, 50% no país chegam ao mínimo, ou seja, conseguem [identificar a informação](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/educacao/2019/02/aluno-do-ensino-medio-de-sp-se-forma-com-desempenho-esperado-para-o-fundamental.shtml) principal de um texto de tamanho médio. A média da organização é de 77%. 

 O nível máximo é atingido por apenas 2% dos brasileiros em leitura e 1% em matemática e ciências. A média da OCDE é de 9%, 11% e 7%, respectivamente.

 O relatório mostra ainda que o Brasil tem um desempenho pior no exame do que países com o mesmo patamar de gastos em educação, a exemplo da Turquia, da Ucrânia e da Sérvia.

 O país, porém, despende menos de US$ 20 mil por estudante ao ano (cerca de R$ 84 mil), em valores convertidos para tornar possível comparar o poder de compra. 

 O relatório registra que, em nações que gastam até US$ 50 mil por aluno, a nota está mais relacionada ao gasto do que para as demais.

 Como ponto positivo para o Brasil, o relatório destaca a inclusão de alunos na escola no período entre 2000 e 2012.

 O texto conclui que ela pode mascarar uma tendência mais positiva de melhora do desempenho —sabe-se que os estudantes incluídos mais tardiamente no sistema escolar tendem a ter mais dificuldade de aprendizagem no início.

 O topo do ranking do Pisa é dominado por países asiáticos. A nação europeia que está mais bem colocada é a Estônia, em 5º lugar em leitura, 8º em matemática e 4º em ciência.

 Quatro províncias e municipalidades da China lideram as três áreas do conhecimento, [superando Cingapura](https://m.folha.uol.com.br/educacao/2016/12/1838761-estagnado-brasil-fica-entre-os-piores-do-mundo-em-avaliacao-de-educacao.shtml?origin=folha) no ranking anterior. 

 São elas Beijing, Xangai, Jiangsu e Zhejiang. Embora longe de representar toda a China, onde vive 1,3 bilhão de pessoas, elas têm uma população nada desprezível: 180 milhões de habitantes.

 Especialmente em matemática e ciência, o desempenho delas é melhor do que os dos demais países por larga margem. Em leitura, é similar ao de Cingapura.

 O bom desempenho vai do topo à base da pirâmide social. Os estudantes dessas regiões chinesas entre os 10% com pior nível socioeconômico vão melhor em leitura do que a média de todos os alunos da OCDE, e tão bem quanto os de melhor nível socioeconômico dos países pertencentes à organização.

 “O que torna sua conquista ainda mais notável é que o nível de renda dessas quatro regiões chinesas está consideravelmente abaixo da média da OCDE. A qualidade das suas escolas hoje alimentará a força de suas economias amanhã”, afirma no prefácio da publicação o secretário-geral da organização, Angel Gurría. 

 Ele classifica ainda como decepcionante o fato de a maioria dos países da OCDE não ter registrado melhora no desempenho desde a primeira aplicação do Pisa, em 2000, mesmo com aumento de 15% no investimento por estudante.

 Gurría registra ainda que apenas 7 dos 79 sistemas educacionais analisados tiveram desde então melhora significativa nas três áreas avaliadas, [sendo Portugal o único](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/educacao/2017/04/1875676-e-preciso-abandonar-modismos-educativos-diz-ex-ministro-portugues.shtml) deles que é integrante da organização.

 Nos Estados Unidos, que [disputam com a China a liderança global](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/clovisrossi/2019/05/a-china-quer-tocar-seu-coracao.shtml), o desempenho dos estudantes coloca o país em 11º lugar em leitura, 30º em matemática e 16º em ciências.

&gt; # [Rusia en América Latina: ¡Se trata de crear conflicto!](https://www.totalnews.es/images/2019/noviembre/RUSIA-EN-AMERICA-LATINA.jpg)
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt;  [[Image](https://totalnews.es/images/2019/noviembre/RUSIA-EN-AMERICA-LATINA.jpg)](https://totalnews.es/index.php/internacionales/74934-rusia-en-america-latina-se-trata-de-crear-conflicto)
&gt; 
&gt;   [Internacionales](https://totalnews.es/index.php/internacionales)  &gt; Durante mucho tiempo existió la opinión de que América Latina era el “patio trasero” de los Estados Unidos, por lo que resultaba bastante natural para Washington ejercer su influencia en los países de la región a través de todos los medios posibles, incluso a través del cambio de sus gobiernos.
&gt; 
&gt;  Al mismo tiempo, a partir por lo menos de mediados del siglo XX, apareció otro actor en materia de “influencia externa” en los países del continente: después de la revolución cubana, la URSS comenzó a participar activamente en los procesos, y el resultado de ello fue la aparición de movimientos comunistas bastante masivos, que en la mayoría de los casos trataban de conseguir objetivos similares, pero muy a menudo recurriendo a la armas.
&gt; 
&gt; Podemos discutir durante mucho tiempo sobre la legalidad y la justicia de tales acciones llevadas a cabo por ambos estados, pero vale la pena reconocerlo: indiscutiblemente Estados Unidos ganó - y al final -, como consecuencia de eso, la situación en el continente realmente mejoró; se produjo una disminución de la pobreza, y en la mayoría de los países, de sistemas de gestión a través de juntas militares se pasó a gobiernos regidos por principios democráticos, y en algunos casos de éxito, superando incluso, a muchos estados europeos tradicionalmente prósperos en términos de nivel de vida. Además, el continente en su conjunto ganó en “tranquilidad”, y los partidos “comunistas” aunque no desaparecieron por completo, comenzaron a perder su poder de influencia, lo que influyó positivamente en cuestiones de seguridad en las regiones donde tradicionalmente operaban.
&gt; 
&gt; Parecía que, a este respecto, la situación iba a continuar mejorando, ya que en efecto en nuestros días la Casa Blanca ha dejado a su suerte incluso “su último bastión de influencia”, un verdadero apoyo a Guaidó en su confrontación con Maduro, asumiendo una posición informal, y dejando que solucionen el conflicto como deseen. Sin embargo, a partir de ese momento y sin que transcurriera demasiado tiempo, surgió otro problema: “despertó” la heredera de la URSS: Rusia, cuya actividad ya se hizo presente de forma notable en los acontecimientos de Chile y Bolivia. Además, lo más desagradable es que Rusia esencialmente hace esto “por deporte”, sin necesidad alguna, en el marco de lo que Moscú considera su confrontación global con los Estados Unidos y sin aportar beneficio alguno a Rusia misma, y a los países de la región.
&gt; 
&gt; Recordemos que, aprovechándose de la crisis política que condujo al cambio de poder en 2014 en un país vecino, Ucrania, Rusia violando todos los acuerdos celebrados previamente con este estado, anexionó parte de su territorio, la península de Crimea. Además, en otra de sus regiones, en el Donbas, Moscú creó un movimiento separatista, a través del cual y con su apoyo directo, pudo organizar una confrontación armada abierta utilizando armamento pesado y llevando a cabo una agresión. Como resultado, Rusia recibió un paquete de sanciones económicas y decidió “agravar la situación en el mundo” con el fin de ejercer presión sobre los países occidentales en búsqueda de la eliminación de las mismas.
&gt; 
&gt; Los que siguen con atención los sucesos están en conocimiento que, durante los cinco años que han transcurrido desde el comienzo de estos eventos, Moscú ha logrado mucho: luchar en Siria, organizar los flujos de refugiados hacia Europa, sus servicios especiales participaron en intentos, con diversos grados de éxito, de asesinar. Pero la dirección principal de acción elegida, fue la denominada “guerra híbrida de información”, cuyo objetivo principal es influir en los acontecimientos en los países del mundo.
&gt; 
&gt; Las investigaciones realizadas mostraron que Rusia, con diversos grados de consecuencias, trató de influir en las elecciones en los Estados Unidos, Francia, Alemania y varios otros países, y en los referéndums de los Países Bajos y Gran Bretaña. Al mismo tiempo, el principal campo de actividad de los servicios especiales rusos fueron los intentos de “desestabilizar la situación” en Cataluña y Escocia, teniendo tales acciones como objetivo principal la desestabilización de la situación en España y el Reino Unido, para lograr que los gobiernos de estos países revisen su política de sanciones con respecto a Moscú. Además, a juzgar por la investigación del New York Times, todo esto está organizado a nivel estatal, y la unidad militar 29155 de la Dirección General de Inteligencia del Estado Mayor de Rusia (inteligencia militar del ejército) está consagrada a ello.
&gt; 
&gt; Un informe publicado por la inteligencia española sobre los resultados de las acciones de Rusia en España, afirma explícitamente: “Parece que la presencia de activistas patrocinados por instituciones rusas en la cobertura mediática del conflicto que se desarrolló en Cataluña en 2017 como resultado de evadir la legitimidad constitucional actual de las instituciones autónomas catalanas individuales, está probada"". Además, existe evidencia de que: “Los agentes rusos promovieron activamente un referéndum sobre la independencia de Cataluña a través de las redes sociales, tratando de desestabilizar a España”. En particular, organizaciones estatales y privadas rusas, así como organizaciones venezolanas, utilizaron Twitter, Facebook y otros recursos de Internet, promocionando el movimiento separatista e intentando persuadir a la opinión pública a favor de la separación de Cataluña en la víspera del referéndum del 1º de octubre. Además, según la ex ministra de Defensa española, María Dolores de Cospedal: “en gran medida, esto vino del territorio ruso”.
&gt; 
&gt; Entre otras cosas, la investigación española reveló la “célula” de los servicios especiales rusos en Venezuela, que, después de los acontecimientos en Cataluña, se utilizó activamente para desestabilizar la situación en América Latina y, hasta ahora con mayor éxito, en Chile y Bolivia. De hecho, los propios rusos hicieron la mayor parte del trabajo para “desestabilizar” España, pero la rama venezolana utilizó este suceso como un campo de entrenamiento, ya que su objetivo principal era y son los países latinoamericanos, porque sus “agentes”comprenden perfectamente la situación en el continente y dominan a la perfección el idioma español.
&gt; 
&gt; Para esta actividad, se tomó a modo de ejemplo, la metodología revelada como resultado de la investigación de Bloomberg luego de la investigación de la participación rusa que provocó la expansión de las protestas de los “chalecos amarillos” en Francia. Su esencia radica en el hecho de que, si es necesario, los bots de Internet controlados por los servicios especiales rusos se muestran súper activos en las redes sociales que apoyan las protestas. En Francia, publicaron en Twitter el hashtag #giletsjaunes, además de lanzar fake sobre las simpatías policiales hacia los manifestantes y una posible rebelión dentro de las propias fuerzas del orden, que apoyaban artificialmente la actividad de los “chalecos amarillos”.
&gt; 
&gt; En Chile, el sistema de trabajo de los bots pro-rusos de Venezuela “funcionó” básicamente de acuerdo con el mismo guion: tratar de “aumentar el grado de tensión” y la coordinación de las protestas. El gobierno de Santiago ha sobrevivido, pero en Bolivia, donde también se observó actividad sospechosa en las redes sociales, en menor medida, no. Además, en relación con esto, también vale la pena recordar la reciente desestabilización de la situación en Ecuador y Nicaragua. Por lo tanto, los hechos indican que existe una probabilidad muy alta de que todos estos eventos sean eslabones de la misma cadena y, si se lleva a cabo una investigación exhaustiva, como se hizo en España, los rastros podrían conducir a los servicios especiales rusos y su “rama venezolana”.
&gt; 
&gt; Además, en esta situación, lo más peligroso consiste en la aparente falta de sentido de tales acciones por parte de Rusia, cuyo interés es desestabilizar la situación en América Latina para “desviar” la atención y los recursos de Estados Unidos y la Unión Europea de su propia agresión en Ucrania y Siria.

In most conversations about modern politics, no part of that description fits. 

“Far-right” is now “right” and “ultranationalism” is now “nationalism”. That’s about as close as you get. Obviously, origination in the 20th century is historical context and not prescriptive (I’m not saying that something isn’t fascism because it didn’t originate in the 20th century).

Much of my issue is that the term is nearly always deployed in a modern context because of its immediate invocation of Nazism - therefore if it is “fascist” it is indefensible - not because it’s an accurate description.

There are basicly two main categories. Hard coal/black coal suitable also for Export has a good Energy density. That's what dominant in the World and in the US. 

Then we have Lignite. Not really suitable for Export, has Energy Density close to Household trash, but great for local production. Mostly used closed to extraction site. Is also used in the US, but only small amounts. And it's produces way more CO2 per kwh generated

&gt;This is not good news for Wyoming, for awhile they were okay economically because they exported their coal to China but now that China is reducing coal power plant construction the mines are in big Trouble

They stopped already. They planning to slowly build those plants back and Export them to other countries. But globally coal is still rising, but with the four biggest Player(USA, EU, China, India)  planning to reduce or already reducing coal there is hope.

&gt;However as I mentioned, demand for coal in the US has been going down for a long time and now we use about only half the amount of coal to generate electricity as we did 20 years ago.

Yes, but if I saw correctly, US still uses more coal than Germany.
USA is improving, but in a very slow paste. And it's mostly driven by markets. America profitted strongly that Germany, Denmark and others pioneered renewables and the Fracking boom.

&gt;Natural gas is significantly better than coal for electricity Generation

No doubt and it's needed, but the Primary Energy source, should be nuclear or renewables. Which in my opinion renewables are better as they are faster to build and USA has ideal locations for many of them.

&gt;This is largely because of fracking technology the use of which has been heavily demonized. 

It's has is disadvantages. And in heavy populated reason like Germany I'm skeptical. But it's up to the region to decide.

&gt;There are areas of fracking that need to be better regulated, specifically methane emissions from production sites and wastewater injection deep into the earth (which can cause earthquakes). 

That's is really a Problem in the US, even with conventional extracting it feels like 3 World/Wild west. The Regulation lack a lot in that regard in the US. Clothing is one of the few things that are well regulated in the US that I know of. 

Also your grid infrastructure is questionable, as seen very well in last forest fire California. 

&gt;Depending on who wins the elections next year (both regional and federal) we will see a shift in how America generates electricity

I don't know it's still seems to be a minor political discussion, which could be influenced with a lot of Money, no matter the Party. The Federal Government just can make incentives and Regulation and I don't see no matter the how the federal states in political Affiliation that it will do much more.

It sometimes seems as the discussion is if climate change exist and not how to combat it.

The biggest Problem is how Society must Change. We Germans need to stop our car obsession and invest heavily more in Trains and Train infrastructure and other things. 

But I see the changes the American Society has to do, even more problematic. Even though more biking and walking would help some americans in many ways.

1. we have been injected with this fake-optimistic ""Brazil, the country of the future"" mindset for the last 50-or-so years. People have slowly started to realize that this ""future"" may never come, and are bitter about it.
2. the election of a left-wing president in the early 2000s, albeit initially considered ""dangerous"" to the market economy, quickly renewed hope in the government fixing ever-increasing social issues in the country (mainly, but not only, income inequality). Presiding over two terms and later managing to elect his preferred successor, Lula did in fact great work to remedy (but not fix) many social issues, but his work on reducing our dependency on commodities was less-than-stellar. That made us especially vulnerable when commodity prices hit rock-bottom in 2014.
3. The 2014 World Cup. No matter how many people say they don't care about football/soccer, it is part of our collective identity as Brazilians, and the 7x1 was a collective ""trauma"" that cemented the (initially low-key) pessimism that had already begun to stick around since the previous year (amid government corruption scandals with construction companies, price hikes in public transportation, and others).
4. Political polarization. Let's face it, Brazil is stuck between a rock and a hard place when it comes to politics. Whoever points out in the opposite direction of the Lula vs. Bolsonaro political spectrum and says ""are these people nuts?"" is right. Although I am particularly shocked when I see people defending Bolsonaro (pre- and post-elections) due to his anti-democractic rhetoric, I can see how others may criticise the cult-like following around Lula, raising conspiracy theories that the entire Justice system is biased against him. What Brazil needs right now is to gather around strong ideas, not populist leaders. This only reinforces our dependency on ""superior"" forces to solve our problems, instead of taking control over our own destiny. And since we're having difficulty believing that these superior forces will do anything at all for the people, we're kinda losing hope.
5. Brazilians are generally emotional beings. I am now risking being criticised over the fact that ""not all Brazilians are the same"", and this is indeed true. But we are talking about the scale as a whole: while people in the South and Southeast may be considered unfriendly and even cold-hearted to someone from, say, the Northeast, they'll still likely be seen as gentle and warm to someone in e.g. Germany (talking from own experience). That is to say that Brazilians in general take matters to the heart and can react in ways that could be considered ""over-reacting"" to someone who's not Brazilian. Your comparison to Eastern European countries is disproportional, because although they've faced worse issues in recent years, they are VERY reserved and kept to themselves, which means that they will most-likely suffer in silence or rely on their more intimate social circle for support, not on a random tourist. Brazilians are not like that: at the same time you're more likely to become friends with a Brazilian in a shorter amount of time, you're also more likely to know about their struggles and frustrations at an earlier point too (isn't that what friends are for as well?). With all that said, YMMV, because as said before, ""not all Brazilians are the same"".

I hope this gives a bit more context to your analysis, but each person experiences reality in a different way.

&gt; PARIS - France and the European Union are ready to fight back over the latest U.S. tariff threats on French products, French government ministers said on Tuesday.

&gt; On Monday, the U.S. government said it may impose punitive duties of up to 100% on $2.4 billion of imports from France, including champagne, handbags, cheese and other products, after concluding that France&amp;#039;s new digital services tax would harm U.S. tech companies.

&gt; French junior economy minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher told Sud Radio that France would be &amp;quot;Pugnacious&amp;quot; in its dealings with the U.S. on the matter, and that France would not back down on its digital tax plans.

Mogens is born and raised in LDP, but couldn't play college hockey so moved to Europe after high school is search of a hockey team to represent. When that didn't work out, Mogens began moonshining in his kitchen in Germany in order to make a living and pay his rent. The corn malt whiskey was a great success in Paderborn, so Mogens grew his moonshine operation with a big copper still, but had a run-in with German law in the spring of 2019, resulting in Mogens moving back to Lower Duck Pond this last summer. 

Mogens parents are Yazidis from Iraq and moved to Lower Duck Pond in the 80's and got Mogens at some point in 1994. Because of Mogens refusal to follow his parents religion and cult, Mogens was thrown out of the house at the age of 15 and became homeless for the first time. Mogens managed to reconcile with his mother at times, moving in and out of his parental home over the years. Mogens parents died when their bakery was the subject of an explosion in the summer of 2019. 

As a hockey player, Mogens was rather physical and scored very little points up until his final two years of high school hockey. Mogens had a cluster of concussions during his active playing career, but they were all un-treated due to the lack medical check-ups in Lower Duck Pond. Therefore, Mogens have a permanent brain damage today. That brain damage was the sole reason why Paderborn's hockey team turned Mogens down, and the reason why Mogens had to call it quits on his hockey career at the age fo 22.

From living in Europe (Germany) for five years coming from a large US city I would see things a bit differently then others have posted, meaning I see more Cons then Pros in some areas.

Also, I'm sure I catch some shit for this, but I would also differentiate things where it works better for society (most people) or does it work better for an individual person like you or I. It can really depend a lot on your own situation on if you will make out better or worse.

(Sorry it is a bit long - my experiences based on living in Germany).

**Safety** \- Much Better then US (for us and most) I agree with some other comments that it feels much safer in most of Europe then in the US. Due to the gun limitation laws I don't spend much time worried about being mowed down when I am out shopping, or at a movie or at dinner.

**Health Care** \- Same (for us) Better then US (for most) - In the US we worked for large companies which had decent health care packages available. Now in Germany and forced to have insurance (which I agree with) the care is also good, but I have not had experiences which are better then in the US, mainly the same. For the average person the situation is a bit better I would say. However I would comment that even though everyone is forced to pay for health care, I would not consider it dirt cheap (my wife and I each pay around 400 euros per month).

**Vacation** \- Same (for us) Better then US (for most) - In the US my wife and I had 27 and 28 vacation days and could use them more or less when we wanted. In Germany we each have 30 days so more or less a wash for us. However I know in the US many do not have near this level. Another point I would make is some European countries (especially Germany) has twice the number of holidays then the US and this is a benefit I do not see listed that often. With the holidays included we have more time off then in the US.

**Transportation** \- Better then US (for us and for most) - Transport in Europe is amazing. The train system can take you anywhere. In Germany specifically the bus and tram lines also work very well and the buses are actually nice to be on (my experience in the US the buses not so clean). Driving is a wash from my perspective, given the street sizes in many cities not as easy to live with a large car (if that is your thing).

**Food** \- Worse then US (for us) Not sure (for most) - When we have been in France, the French food has been great, when in Italy, the Italian food is great and when in Germany, the German food is great. But finding good Mexican or even American food is hard in Germany. Also despite having a large Asian population, the Chinese and Thai food we find is not that appealing. Since we came from a large US city which had a lot of variety this is a downgrade for us.

Along with the variety, the overall level of service is quite poor. The waiters seem to really think they are doing you a favor to take your order, bring you the bill, etc. and not part of their job.

A few have also mentioned that it is nice in Europe how you are not kicked out of your table as quick as in the US. This can be nice, but every coin has two sides. Many small restaurants fill up quickly without reservations as they plan for parties to be there for three hours. Also waiting for a table can be a real gamble when you have persons who finish their meal then stay for another hours. I still get a laugh when we sometimes eat our early and are told we can have a table, but must be done in 2.5 or 3 hours for the next reservation.

**Work Culture** \- Worse then US (for us) Better then US (for some) - It is in fact harder to get fired in Germany and some other European countries. However if you are someone who performs well at their job this is not something you perhaps need to worry about as much. Also in Europe they do still perform layoffs as in the US, i.e. Deutsche Bank or the trend at Siemens for many years.

Many persons in Germany seem to think of work as secondary to their life - ""I work to live"" - which is a good philosophy on paper. What it means though in practice working with persons like this, in a team environment, is that they do not carry their own weight. Everyone has had that person in their group project in Uni who only showed up for the final presentation, right? - this happens a lot in the work culture. Since it is harder to fire persons this situation continues.

On top of this if you are a tariff employee you are entitled to certain wages increases the labor unions negotiate - IG Metall in Germany secured a large one a few years back. However this goes to all persons irregardless of how they perform on the job. Great for everyone in general to have a bit more money, but if you are performing twice as well as your co-worker maybe not so motivating to get the same raise. Other raises are possible, but not as frequently given vs US (IMO).

**Taxes** \- Worse then US (for us) Worse then US (for most) I have seen several posts that education is free in Europe, taxes only a ""bit higher"", etc.

I have to disagree with this strongly, however it will again depend on your personal situation. Germany has a progressive tax system like the US, but the rates go up to 45%, and we hit the 42% ourselves for a portion of our income. Max rate in the US is 37%.

For investment income, all is taxed at 25%. In the US, max rate would be 20% and to hit it would need to make over 400,000 USD. For real estate investments, the German calculation of certain factors is also different which causes the tax to be higher. There are also several nuances of the tax code in Germany which make taxes higher (ex. losses only allowed against gains) but to keep this shortish I don't go into.

In Germany the monies collected form the taxes go to worthwhile things (perhaps better then producing another aircraft carrier like in the US) but the taxes are much higher then in the US.",True,False,False,,,0,1575368842,,False,0,{},f9jdj4i,False,t3_e51njc,False,True,t3_e51njc,/r/travel/comments/e51njc/life_in_europe_seems_more_peaceful_and_idyllic/f9jdj4i/,False,,1584369299,2,True,False,travel,t5_2qh41,r/travel,public,0,

The main thing to keep in mind are the phone specs, 2gig ram is the bare minimum but I suggest buying at least 3gigs. the moto g7 and pixel have 4gigs ram I believe. From what I've read the Moto g7 comes out quite good in most comparisons. If you live outside of the US you may want to look at the new Xiaomi mi 9t  aswell as you get higher specs for the same cost.

However because of the lower population density in Europe compared to India, both by nature of the landmasses but also the timeframe (IE migration into Europe happened much earlier than in India, in fact IE migration into India is linked to an out of Europe migration from Indo-Europeans), within a few generations this division of 'yamnaya' related admixture per social class would not have been existent anymore and everyone would have had more or less an 'equal' distribution of steppe admixture.

As of today my WiFI 5 isn't limiting my Internet connection and transfers to my NAS are with 40MB/s fast enough for backups. For serious data transfers, there is nothing beating the TB3 port anyway. People complaining now about WiFI mostly don't even have 5GHz enabled WiFI 5 or simply lacking some repeaters in the room where they are most of the time. And for public places like Airports. I still have to see any 5GHz wifi at an airport or university here in Europe. And even then. The WiFi5 is usually fast enough for the assigned Internet speed you get. Places which have a shitty WiFi today won't get magically a better WiFI with WiFI6, because they would still need to invest a lot of money into their infrastructures.

Dinsdag werd een driejaarlijkse rapportage over het onderwijsniveau van scholieren uit OESO-landen gepubliceerd. Nederland scoort relatief slecht op leesvaardigheid.

Nederlandse vijftienjarigen scoorden in 2018 slechter op leesvaardigheid dan leeftijdsgenoten uit andere rijke landen. Dat blijkt dinsdag uit een driejaarlijks vergelijkend onderzoek onder 60.000 leerlingen uit 79 landen, ook wel bekend als de PISA-test. Het onderzoek, dat werd uitgevoerd onder leiding van de OESO, heeft drie pijlers en genereert een belangrijk rapportcijfer van het Nederlandse onderwijs. In de oorzaken van de kennisafname geeft het onderzoek geen inzage.

Net iets meer dan driekwart van de middelbare scholieren in Nederland (76 procent) kunnen het belangrijkste idee uit een tekst halen. Dat is net iets onder het gemiddelde van 77 procent, maar wel een stuk lager dan bij de laatste PISA-test in 2015. Van de 550 te behalen punten behaalde Nederlandse scholieren er toen gemiddeld 503, in de meest recente rapportage is dat 485.

In alle onderzochte landen ging de leesvaardigheid achteruit, maar in Nederland gaat dat volgens onderwijsbond AOb het hardst. Van de Europese landen scoorde Estland op het gebied van leesvaardigheid het best, gevolgd door Finland en Ierland.

Ook de kennis van natuurwetenschappen onder Nederlandse scholieren slinkt. Nederland scoort met 503 punten op dat gebied nog wel bovengemiddeld, maar het komt alsnog 6 punten lager uit dan bij de vorige meting. Op het gebied van wiskunde boeken de scholieren wel vooruitgang. Na Estland komt Nederland als hoogst scorend Europees land uit de rapportage op het gebied van wiskundevaardigheden. Op vrijwel alle vlakken kwam China, dat ook werd meegerekend, als hoogst scorend land uit de bus.
„Uitstekende resultaten”

Ministers Ingrid van Engelshoven (D66) en Arie Slob (ChristenUnie) willen dat de leesvaardigheid wordt verbeterd. Er moet meer aandacht komen voor leesmotivatie in het curriculum. Ook komt er meer hulp voor groepen scholieren met een leesachterstand, zoals vmbo’ers en meertalig opgevoede leerlingen.

[],,barryvm,1426512108.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_m8ybh,False,False,[],"&gt; It was reported by Barnier himself that May never mentioned the possibility of UK leaving without a WA, not even once

Probably not in the official negotiations, because the UK negotiators realized that this would be incredibly damaging.

&gt; The old hag was only telling that to her domestic audience and was lying through her teeth each time she repeated ""ND is better than a BD"".

Probably true. The problem is that, for the EU, no deal **is** better than a bad deal (e.g. one without the WA), so threatening to leave if the EU does not concede is not a workable tactic. In fact, the EU could not accept a deal without the WA even if it wanted to (the Republic of Ireland would simply veto it or threaten to veto the FTA).

&gt; It was only after Boris replaced her, finally laid the no-deal warning on the table and voila! What was insisted upon for 3 years was suddenly changed.

That is not true. The EU has always said that it would be open to permanent solutions that would replace the backstop, for the simple reason that the backstop is not necessary if a real solution is available. Mr. Johnson did threaten with ""no deal"" and the only response from Brussels was them saying they were waiting for the UK to come up with an alternative. The alternative, when it finally arrived, was  the UK essentially putting Northern Ireland in the EU single market permanently (i.e. the EU Commission's original proposal but permanent rather than temporary).

To be perfectly honest, I understand the UK parliament's problem with the original ""backstop"" but I do not understand why they would vote for this plan instead. If the original plan would infringe on UK sovereignty over NI, then this one is objectively worse in that respect.

&gt; The UK offered the EU to mutually guarantee each others' citizens' rights, the EU declined. They are totally using them as bargaining chip in the negotiations and not acting rationally.

The rationale is this: the EU will not sign ""mini deals"" because that would result in the UK picking and choosing the bits it likes and leave the rest for the EU to solve. To avoid this, the EU insists on putting everything into one deal (the WA) to ensure the quid pro quo is clear. You are correct that this is a bargaining tactic.

&gt; The rational decision would be to agree to as many non-conflicting things as possible and lock them in

Unfortunately, that is not the case. The rational thing would be to use the lopsided balance of power, the control it had over the agenda and the UK's weak negotiation position to maximize its own advantage in pursuit of its strategic goals. And that is exactly what happened. This is an example of the moral myopia resulting from realpolitik: by driving a hard bargain they counted on securing their (relatively benign) objectives but as a consequence they were risking the rights of the people they were trying to safeguard. I agree with you that there is a moral problem there and IMHO citizens' rights should have been protected as a matter of course for ethical reasons alone. I'm just not sure whether that would have ever happened given the acrimonious atmosphere of the negotiations.

That said, a similar thing will happen with the trade deal: the EU will only agree on a comprehensive trade deal if the UK pledges to uphold a level playing field (which means broadly adhering to EU standards and regulation) for the total package. It's going to be another all or nothing round of negotiations, just like the trade deals it made with other countries (Canada, the failed one with the USA, ...). And why wouldn't it?

Interesting civilizations.  Incas and Aztec are pretty recent (only hundreds of years before the Spaniards) compared to the peak of the Mayas (420 AD). Incas and Aztec mostly build over other ancient civilizations.

&gt;From what I know there are basically none of them left since the Spanish &amp; co. killed them

There are still some descendants from those cultures, even some spoken languages. Also, even if the Spanish did a lot of the killing, disease, Latin American independent states and many other indigenous tribes helped to reduce the population.

&gt;Do you know much about the original Natives of Latin America?

A bit about Arawak, Wayuu and Taino. Many words and culinary culture derive from those cultures.

&gt;Do you think it's a shame that their cultures were eradicated?

Sure. Anybody dreams with the idea of what could have resulted. It is a shame that we did not have the chance to preserve more about their culture.

The first is that I am Female-to-Male Transgender. I plan on getting my name and gender changed here in the US, will it be accepted in Germany?

yes, it is accepted in Germany. Germany currently allows four different genders in passports and other official documents: female, male, diverse, and [empty]. Regarding other EU countries, I do not know. You should have no problem in most EU countries but I am not sure about some conservative eastern European countries like Poland, Hungary. But even there you should not have a problem as a tourist as long as you are not trying to marry there...

&gt; The first option, would be to study in Germany and work remotely for an American company, so that my residency visa is dependant on my school and so that I do not have to get a work visa as well, while in school.

a student visa allows to automatically to work in Germany for 240 half days (up to 4 hours) or 120 full days per calendar year. 

&gt; From what I see, German companies must exhaust their German applicants before turning to international applicants

that is only one option, there are other options: https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/wiki/how-to-germany

But with a two-year bookkeeping degree it is probably correct that none of these options is open for you because Associate degrees do not even exist in Germany (only Bachelor and Master) and because I assume that you learned some foreign bookkeeping rules and not the relevant German bookkeeping rules.

So it is probably impossible for you currently to find a job that would qualify for any of the immigration visas and the best way would be to study in Germany first: https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/wiki/how-to-study

There is a special immigration visa for graduates of German universities that make it very easy. The main requirement is that you as a graduate find any job that is connected to your degree within 18 months after graduation. Companies do not have to sponsor you, they can hire you as if you were a German. https://www.make-it-in-germany.com/en/study-training/study/opportunities-after-graduation/residence-permit/

&gt; I would hope by the time I apply for citizenship my language will be good enough, but I am also hoping my education will qualify as well (some of my research says you need a master's degree or else a really good reason to be there)

you do not need a Masters degree or a ""really good reason to be there"" to become a citizen. It is sufficient that you are a legal immigrant who is in Germany for 8 years. https://www.make-it-in-germany.com/en/visa/living-permanently-in-germany/naturalisation/prerequisites/

The slave trade wasn’t limited to the US, millions of African people were also brought to central and South America hence why Afro Latinos exist and it’s also why white Latinos...exist since Spaniards/Portuguese people came from Europe and colonized the Southern Hemisphere much like English people colonized and settled down in the US. And then of course there’s the indigenous, brown people who lived on the continent prior to all of this. The word Hispanic is for people in Latin America with ties to Spain, Latino is used by people who live in the US but have ties to Latin American countries. So Latino isn’t a race anyone who is born in Mexico, central, South America could identify as 100% Latino regardless of their ancestry. 


**Side note**

They don’t really do a good job of teaching this in the primary American education system and it seems like there’s a lot of confusion about South America/ Mexico in general. But once you understand the fact that races are socially constructed it’s not a mystery. 
Prior to colonization the people who lived on the North American/south American continent were indigenous people genetically similar to each other. But then the Spaniards came from Europe and colonized most of the Southern Hemisphere, hence why most Latin American countries main language is Spanish and the English colonized the North. So this gets into the fact that race is a social construct an indigenous person from San Diego is now classified as ethnically Native American and an indigenous person from Tijuana is now classified as Mexican even though they would be genetically similar to each other.. arbitrary borders have resulted in a changed perception of their “race” (Put in quotations because Mexican isn’t even a race but, rather a Nationality).  These borders didn’t exist prior to the Spaniards and English arriving.",True,False,False,,,0,1575378881,,1575379605,0,{},f9jlhe2,False,t3_e5eaoz,False,True,t1_f9jhiqs,/r/gatekeeping/comments/e5eaoz/not_gonna_lie_if_a_white_guy_said_this_it_wouldve/f9jlhe2/,False,,1584373626,9,True,False,gatekeeping,t5_3fkyp,r/gatekeeping,public,0,

Hanko rent was swapped for Porkkala rent. That's the only territory change in addition to Petsamo.

&gt;Are they running from good life?

Ah, but that's capitalism and free movement for you. And the same thing is still happening in Russia too.

But I guess, people are entitled to emigrate if they want. It's sad that they don't respect building their country for better, but that's freedom.

&gt;But that one ain't worse. So, we present to you leader of international affairs, superpower dealing with USA and China - Norway!

You do realise that the Norwegian oil fund is worth over 1 trillion dollars? That's pretty much sitting on the capital.

&gt;Second one is lie, and i've described you why.

How come? You just need to get people sign some support cards and enter yourself into the election - or that's how it works in Finland.

&gt;What power they should have? To define life of whole USSR? To make it work in their favour? In fact their republics were subsidized for years, to make economical ties and industry closer to europe.

To rule their own country, without having to be lackeys for Moscow.

&gt;As WWI showed - it was. Ridiculous when region of country at war sends more people to other side, than to country itself.

WWI was over 15 years after the Finnish military was abolished, and there were the period of Russification between.

&gt;Jägers

That happened much, much later than the abolishment of the Finnish military. Since you imply that the Czar knew the future (knowing in 1898 that some Finns will join the Prussian Army in 1915), why did he act so foolishly and ruled so bad that he had to renounce the throne?

You mix up the order of events to create completely anachronistic views.

&gt;And i doubt russian Whites promoted for example return of Finland to Russian empire. These whites were effectively white finns by that time. And their work proves that.

So Russians became Finns when they chose to oppose the Bolsheviks in White Finnish ranks?

&gt;Imagine current finnish officer doing this during some random war, let's say with Norway - and commandment learning about that, would he be left in service?

Defeatism, complaining or grumbling isn't yet a crime in Finnish military. Actually, you are even allowed to openly object to your superior's orders, as long as you still fulfill them; if the orders are illegal you are allowed to object and to not to fulfill the said orders.

Of course someone who always criticises his superior's decisions and orders is viewed as a troublemaker, and won't probably advance in rank, but that's not illegal.

&gt;Did you have thousands people meetings of people who want to overthrow state power?

Not under the current, more liberal regulation - though some years ago we had over 100 000 people demonstrating in Helsinki against the cabinet, as they enacted some unpopular austerity laws.

Back in the old times, when there were the anti-revolutionary law in place, it was used two times: when the communist preparations for a new revolution had been earthed and the legislation enacted under the demands from the far right, and then after the Lapua Movement did their Mäntsälä Rebellion, after which the Lapua Movement was banned.

&gt;Except Lapua were radicals and were directed for violence. Not to some ""friendship of nations"" or ""collective owning of means of production"". So...

Yet the Communists in Finland also wanted to topple the democratic government, and replace it with their tyranny. And to steal people's rightful property.

&gt;What cannons from Nikolai times could've controlled half a strait?

[Here you can see](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/GulfofFinlanddefence1917.jpg/800px-GulfofFinlanddefence1917.jpg) that the forts completed in 1917 could already cut the traffic in the gulf between Porkkala and Tallinn.

The mightiest guns in the Finnish and Estonian coastal artillery were indeed Czarist era 305 mm Obuhov guns.

&gt;If i'm not mistaken it happened in 1936 by both Finland and Estonia.

What you are then talking about? Of mining of the gulf, I know only the Juminda minefield which was laid at the beginning of the Continuation War.

&gt;And how their fathers got pieces of property times bigger than their neighbours? By hard work mostly? Hard work was the main social ladder for last century?

Well, in Finland the best ladder was getting to the Czar's service and proving yourself capable, as the Finnish noblemen didn't have ownership over peasants, the peasants were all free in Finland. The second best ladder had been hard work over many generations, which started to accumulate wealth to the family. In the old times of Swedish rule, the best option for a person without any property, was to initially become a Crown farmer (a tenant of the King), to pay three years of extra taxes to redeem the Crown farm into personal property, work to get money for a horse, sword and a musket, and then pledge yourself as a horseman for the army, which gave the pledges exemption of taxation. Now you could start accumulating wealth for yourself and for your descendants.

&gt;I like how you worship Europe, despite ward, genocides, intrigues, famines, colonies, exploitation, etc-etc.

Without Europe, the whole of Russia would be pagan Fennic tribes which would go under Mongol oppression in 1200s, and muslims or Khazar Jews. The founder of Rus, Rurik himself, was a Swedish Viking of paternally Finnish descent, and his bloodline continued until Ivan the Terrible. The Varangians who used to bring order to the Rus were Swedish Vikings. The people who brought Christianity to Russia came initially from the Roman Empire, through Bulgaria to Kyiv, and from there to Novgorod and Moscow, and they brought the language there too. The progression which Peter the Great brought was learnt from Holland and Germany. Catherine the Great was a German. Marx was a German, and the ideas of Communism came to Russia from Germany. Germany even aided Lenin to get to Russia in 1917.

So, Russia is European too.

Not only that, but they conquered half of Europe and ruthlessly pillaged it, including forcing East Germany to pay 20% of GDP in reparations well into the 1950s and used a fair bit of POW and slave labor from occupied countries to help rebuild.

Unlike the UK the USSR had a huge population and much larger pre-war economy just by it's shear size and population (one estimate of GDP as of 1941 before the Nazis invaded had them at at least parity with Nazi Germany).

Because of the nature of the Soviet economy they didn't have debt to pay back, nor foreign creditors as they didn't pay back Lend-Lease, the only external imports they received.  Since they had a large birthrate before the war, well above the European average at the time, they were able to repopulate relatively quickly once the got the post-war famine situation sorted and their military demobilized.  The US and UK birthrates were considerably smaller.

It's power projection ability was rather limited, but since they were neighboring Europe it was easy to supply a huge army near the post-war border.  

In the long term though the occupation of Europe cost them more than they received from it, as they had to subsidize the various communist puppet economies, while still having to import from the US.  Plus the USSR was never as strong as we (or even their leadership) thought.  They just spent a huge chunk of their GDP on the military, which ultimately undermined their economy and led to the public effectively revolting against them.  IIRC they averaged 20-25% of the GDP on military spending, while the US peaked at about 5%.  The standard of living was much higher in the US than the USSR; having talked to a daughter of a Soviet officer stationed in East Germany in the middle of the Cold War, even their military and their families lived had a very rough life of privation because of how little they had to go around.  So they largely did it by skimping on the quality of life stuff to have a huge military and punch above their weight.

After all this was the famous incident that in part convinced Soviet leadership they were too far behind the US to really compete:

VAT is regressive. Combining it with something progressive like UBI does not make VAT progressive. There is nothing that stops a future Congress from keeping VAT and getting rid of the FD or watering it down to virtually nothing. Let's take an actual example from the past:

One of the critiques against Bernie is that he voted for Biden's 1994 Crime Bill. Bernie railed (correctly) against the crime bill, but he supported it because it was bundled together with the Violence Against Women Act and the Assault Weapons ban. 25 years later we still have Biden's crime bill measures as law. The Assault Weapons Ban lasted 10 years. The Violence Against Women Act longer, but it is also gone. **The exact same thing can happen with VAT and FD: VAT stays, FD is watered down or discontinued.** 

Yang's FD is **NOT** UBI. It is not universal, so calling it UBI is disingenuous. 

VAT is 100% paid by consumers. Not just theoretically, also empirically. In that post of mine that /u/FThumb linked to are several studies. [One of them was posted](https://voxeu.org/article/assessing-incidence-value-added-taxes) by someone trying to prove that VAT is *not* paid 100% by consumers. Unfortunately for that person who posted, [the link actually shows \(proves again\) that VAT is 100% paid by consumers and not companies.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/dymky3/how_vat_really_works_debunking_yangs_insinuations/f8kfuvh/?context=3).

To save you some time, look at the first link in my previous paragraph (to the study results). This was a study of VAT changes in Europe, 1996-2005. Look to Figure 4, which is a graph of results for all changes. 

* If VAT goes up, **within 4 months 100% of the VAT change is passed on to the consumer.** 

* If VAT goes down, **within 2 months, over 100% of the VAT change is passed on to the consumer**

Over time, this means that businesses will continue to **increase** profit margins by passing on over 100% of VAT changes to consumers. 

In the US, a VAT doesn't exist. A logical question is: ""When a new VAT has been introduced, how much is passed on to the consumer?"" 

Turns out just such a situation exists. Australia introduced a 10% VAT (they call it ""GST"") at the same time they reduced several other taxes. The government did a study and estimated that a neutral introduction (100% pass-through) would result in[ 2.2% increase in total consumer price increases \(10% up for GST and 7.8% down due to reduction in other taxes\)](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/607c/7c1fd2cc9463799bffcf5c116117aa134ee1.pdf). What resulted, however, [was a 2.8% price increase](https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/Publications_Archive/CIB/cib9899/99cib07#2) across the country in general. Meaning that **well over 100% of VAT was (is) being passed on to the consumer with the introduction of a new VAT.** 

To be noted, for the lowest quintile, the CPI was not 2.2% or even 2.8%, but 4.4%! Meaning the poorest 20% of the country pays twice as much as the expected increase in consumer prices. Only in the 4^th and 5^th quintile (highest 60% and 80% of income earners) is there a less than 100% pass-through rate (refer to table 1 in the last link of the previous paragraph). This effect also explains why billionaires like Jeff Bezos and his ilk are in favor of a VAT. They know that although they will pay more in dollars than the poor, in percentage of income they will pay much less. The rich are always in favor of flat taxes like a VAT rather than a progressive income tax or wealth tax.

So there you have it (again). 

TL; DR: A VAT is regressive. There is no assurance that a progressive payout (FD) will be retained after the introduction together with a regressive VAT. In any case, empirically 100+% of a VAT is passed on to consumers, with the poorest 20% of earners paying the lion's share of the VAT.

Hispanics, as an 'ethnicity', are extremely diverse. Spanning all across south america, to central america, to north america, to europe if you want to count the actual spanish. There is essentially no genetic consistency, or even physical consistency in terms of skin color, hair color, eye color, etc.

And yet, in america, we would call someone from Argentina 'hispanic' and someone from mexico 'hispanic', when those two people could not be more culturally and biologically different from eachother. Even their spanish language is subtly different. So how do we define being 'hispanic' as your race?

In short, people are hispanic, because they IDENTIFY as being hispanic. They think that label, in broad strokes, describes how they see themselves or how other people see them. Many people could be called CIS-hispanic: the are assumed to be hispanic based on their heritage, and they are happy with that identity.

But if they are black-hispanic, or white-hispanic, or anything-hispanic: they can choose to identify as Black/White/etc. instead. They can identify as a different race, than they would otherwise be assigned by heritage. A sort of Trans-Racial identity.

I had a friend who had mixed parentage, and by all account could pass for white. We were friends for many years before i learned that his mother's family immigrated from Honduras. When we got older, my friend chose to identify as being spanish. People assumed him to be 'white' all the time, and he would have to correct them. *""No, I'm actually hispanic, my family is from honduras""*.Even though, *his father* was of a Germanic, white heritage.

**In many ways, a hispanic ethnicity can function similar to a gender identity. One can exist as both hispanic and another race at the same time, or they can choose to identify as being hispanic, which subsumes the other race, or vice versa. Much in the same way you can be gender neutral, or Trans-Gender, or firmly CIS-gendered.  It's all about, at it's core, how you choose to identify.**",True,False,False,,,0,1575383908,,False,0,{},f9jri0r,False,t3_e5bye9,False,False,t3_e5bye9,/r/changemyview/comments/e5bye9/cmv_people_who_say_gender_is_just_a_social/f9jri0r/,False,,1584376960,5,True,False,changemyview,t5_2w2s8,r/changemyview,public,0,

From what I see in my area, the education from 13 to 16 (OS) is severely lacking in every sector. My English teacher could barely speak the language (grammar and pronunciation) and I left with basic maths skills. Most importantly though is that my OS only touched on history and left many shaping events out. We didn’t have any proper Geography or world sciences. My German teacher did an okay job, apart from the fact he failed to tell me that my German was terrible (English mother tongue) and let a lot of mistakes slide instead of correcting them or doing anything to improve my grammar. 

I don’t want to support the other comment saying that it’s all down to the foreigners, but some can be attributed to them. For instance: where I live being able to speak dialect is much more important for integration than being able to speak proper German. A lot of children with immigration background (parents out of east Europe) focus on leaving dialect and neglect proper Hochdeutsch, because they only need it in school until 16 and then they do a Lehre. 

Another Aspekt to the bad Hochdeutsch here are the Swiss children, who’s native tongue (dialect) has different tenses, sentence structure and pronunciation to Hochdeutsch. Of course they learn Hochdeutsch in school, but they don’t talk or write it out of school.

---

J’ai réussi à l’examen B2 en février 2019. Je te conseille de préparer autant que possible avec des examens blancs. Je sais pas si tu as déjà passé un examen DELF, mais il est plutôt particulaire. La façon dont l’on se préparerait à passer l’examen B2 n’est pas la même dont l’on se préparerait à parler avec un niveau B2. C’est con, mais c’est vrai. Au plus to connais le format de l’examen, au plus to te sentiras à l’aise dans la salle de l’examen. 

* **En général** : Quelque chose d’important à retenir, c’est que les 4 parties de l’examen sont divisées pour toi **et aussi pour l’examinateur**. Ça veut dire que dans la partie de compréhension écrite, par exemple, où tu dois donner des réponses à des questions s’agissant un article que tu lis, **on peut pas te pénaliser pour les fautes d’orthographe que tu fais dans tes réponses écrites**. Si l’examinateur comprend bien ce que tu essaies de dire, il doit te donner les points complets. La même chose s’applique pour les autres parties de l’examen aussi. Tu peux utiliser ça à ton avantage en sacrifiant la grammaire parfaite pour plus de vitesse.

* **Compréhension orale** : Écouter des podcasts qui durent 30-60 mn et essayer de suivre l’idée générale de la conversation : c’est bien. Par contre, écouter des émissions de radio qui durent 1-5 mn et essayer d’écrire les noms, les chiffres, et les points importants que disent les orateurs pendant que tu les écoutes : c’est mieux. Parce que c’est ça qui t’attend dans l’examen. L’enregistrement va très vite, et bien que tu puisses écouter le premier deux fois, le deuxième ne se passe qu’une seule fois. Et une fois que c’est fini, c’est fini. 

* **Compréhension écrite** : Similaire à la compréhension orale, lire des articles causalement et essayer de suivre l’idée générale de l’article : c’est bien. Par contre, lire des articles aussi vite que possible et essayer de souligner les noms, les chiffres, et les points importants pendant que tu les lises : c’est mieux. Dans les examens comme celui-ci, c’est le temps qui est ton plus grand ennemi. Tu veux pas arriver à la fin de la partie de compréhension écrite avant même d’avoir eu le temps de répondre à toutes les questions.

* **Production écrite** : Écrire des essais qui racontent des histoires de ce qui s’est passé dans ta vie : c’est bien. Par contre, écrire des lettres où tu te plains de quelque chose au maire de ta ville, tes voisins, l’éditeur de ton magazine préféré : c’est mieux. Parce c’est presque certain qu’il faudra que tu fasses ça dans l’examen. Également, chercher en ligne des exemples pour avoir une idée du format de la lettre que l’on attend de toi. Les examinateurs sont connus pour enlever plusieurs points si tu n’as pas tous les petits détails : le bon titre, la bonne salutation, la bonne conclusion, etc.

* **Production orale** : Pratiquer parler de ta vie quotidienne et des actualités avec tes amis en français : c’est bien. Mais pratiquer formuler un argument en peu de temps sur un sujet complexe et abstrait : c’est mieux. Dans l’examen tu choisiras au hasard quelques morceaux de papier (je pense qu’on m’a demandé d’en tirer 2 d’un bol) sur lesquels est écrit quelques phrases d’un certain sujet. Tu auras puis 30 minutes pour formuler un argument pour (ou contre) le sujet. Le débat dure 20 mn au total : environ 10 mn de présentation de ta part, et environ 10 mn de discussion entre toi et l’examinateur. Rappelle-toi de tes courses d’anglais au lycée : où ton prof t’a conseillé de formuler tes essais avec une bonne introduction, 3 points d’argument concrètes, et une conclusion solide. L’examinateur du B2 attend la même chose dans l’examen, alors fais pareil avec ton débat.

Both these were addressed in the US (not in China though which has insane smog now) and perhaps that did stop an impending ice age, though I doubt it.

Cooler temperatures can happen from atmospheric changes. Krakatoa's 1883 eruption emitted huge amounts of sulfur dioxide, lowering global temperatures a ""massive"" 0.4 degrees in 1884. Not an eternal ice age, and things returned to normal fairly quickly.

Serial medieval plagues due to general poor hygeine and sanitation, as well as the killing of cats during witchcraft hysteria killed off massive numbers of european peasant farmers. Farmland returned to wild land and new forests. This was a huge carbon sink that plummeted global temperatures causing the ""little ice age"" that started around 1300 and continued in various forms back and forth to the 19th century, not all due to the same thing. The temperature drop in the 16th-18th century was likely due to the mass extermination of native americans during that time and the similar return of their mass farmlands and cities to what came to be called ""untouched wilderness"".

Current carbon emissions are not resulting in predicted increased levels of atmospheric carbon. What happened instead is the CO2's been absorbed by the world's oceans, acidifying them, and killing off a huge amount of ocean life. This is a massive problem and the key problem with excess CO2, it's pushing the oceans in the direction of the extremely high carbon Carboniferous Epoch, where jellyfish and squids dominated and flourished and mammals and fish had yet to evolve. By the time higher life did appear atmospheric carbon levels were so extreme that enormous insects and later things like pterosaurs were able to exist and fly in the soupy air.

The oceans are also being destroyed by massive pollution. What is happening is probably going to have long term catastrophic global effects. Not from atmospheric CO2 though. If someone wants a global effort to save the earth the oceans are where the work needs to be done now.

If it's found CO2 in the atmosphere is a problem it's a trivial fix. Switch to zero-carbon nuclear globally. Not these old early plant designs that are severely flawed, most which should be shut down. Modern designs that are incapable of meltdown, are low maintenance, and don't produce nuclear waste that is a danger for tens of millions of years and hence can not possibly be safely managed long term.

The vast majority of brits, excluding a handful of legitimate far-right people, were pro immigration. And still are.

Hence Brexit. Because as soon as you question these agreements and the effects of their abuse on the people you're shunned and labelled as a racist. Or labelled outright ""anti-immigrant"".

If the left was genuine in its argumentation then they would have conceded a long time ago that there is an obvious issue with the current overly liberal laws and the people wouldn't have massively rallied to the other side.

Still doesn't make them anti-immigration. That mostly makes them anti-terrorism, which should be an obvious stance, but that implies restricting immigration to a certain extend, which is utterly unacceptable for the modern left.

During the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic, the US government, among other international states, [banned](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/rapid-response-was-crucial-containing-1918-flu-pandemic) public gatherings. During the 2003 SARS outbreak, about 30,000 non-diagnosed patients were quarantined in Canada, and patients who were diagnosed were treated for symptoms of viral pneumonia, even if they didn't have those symptoms. This is where current SARS treatment methods come from. In a few European countries, the MMR vaccine is legally mandated since international outbreaks caused some concern.  
&gt;  
&gt;All this is to say, ""protocol"" can mean anything as specific as a treatment or prevention for the spreading of disease, illness, or future harm. It can also mean a public health process as general as quarantine orders, like in the SARS example. I don't believe quarantines are actually passed as law, if I said so I was mistaken. Quarantines are an *order*. In the US, the CDC [oversees](https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/aboutlawsregulationsquarantineisolation.html) quarantines for example to make sure the quarantine orders and protocols are legal. I don't believe a specific quarantine order has ever been passed in a bill or written into a state or federal code, again, if I said so before, I was mistaken. Usually a state governor declares a quarantine or isolation, kind of like an executive order.

So like I said, it can mean *alot* of things. Likewise, nothing indicates new methods being created ON THE SPOT of legislation or without being derived from previously tested method to achieve a similar goal.

&gt;Artificial implantation is well proved and tested. I'm sure you know about IVF.

Apples and oranges. IVF is different from removing a ectopic embryo and simply putting it somewhere else by virtue of the fact the IVF deals with moving Zygotes that are [UNDER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo_transfer) a week old. As of now, it is [still a concern](https://www.theexpertinstitute.com/case-studies/delayed-diagnosis-of-ectopic-pregnancy-leads-to-total-salpingectomy/) of accurately attaining diagnosis within the first trimester.

Cite a source on ectopic strategies involving this or back off. I already did, and reimplantation doesn't apply. Most literature involving the two are actually based on the risk of ecotopic pregnancies from IVF.

&gt;[Of non-reimplanted ectopic pregnancies, the highest survival rate of fetuses that I've found is 1 in 3 million, or 0%](https://www.verywellfamily.com/can-an-ectopic-pregnancy-be-saved-2371464). *EDIT: not sure I trust that source, the rate may be lower.* The bill states that if applicable, a reimplantation operation should be conducted if it will save the life of the fetus without risking the life of the mother, in other words, if the fetus will gain some appreciable chance at life and the mother's chance of living will not appreciably fall. Am I correct that you don't believe this exchange is possible? That a reimplantation cannot gain the fetus a 1% chance at surviving while the mother's mortality risk remains less than 1%? Sorry if this is poorly worded, I can spend time rephrasing it if you need.

*A theoretical method that was tested* might. The aw, however, doesn't specify that.

In otherwords, it doesn't distinguish an actual objective to refine such techniques. Instead, it potentially defends the efforts of a Doctor doing what he must to look out for his own neck while making a medical misjudgment.

Had the law specified actual conservation methods for viable ecotopic fetuses, then it could be defendable. As it is, it is not on the basis of established techniques.

&gt;Do you realize that if it isn't *worth it* in terms of the mother's life to save the fetus' life, the bill does not allow punishment of a doctor who decides to remove that pregnancy?

Actually, it *does* allow the Doctor to be punish if the baby is legally determined viable and he doesn't do everything possible to save it.

There would be better scientific credibility if it actually applied current methods on viable fetuses that I've cited.

&gt;Not all life-saving methods are convenient, then.

Especially when they do not exist.

&gt;I think that an American who calls themselves ""pro-life"" would demand that the life of a fetus be a primary concern, equal to the life of the mother, in prenatal care. According to Gallup 2019, [49% of Americans are pro-life](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1576/abortion.aspx). Therefore, I think that 49%/roughly half of Americans demand that the life of a fetus be a primary concern.

Those metals, they say, having become of less value themselves, the use of any particular portion of them necessarily became of less value too, and consequently the price which could be paid for it. This notion, which at first sight seems plausible, has been so fully exposed by Mr. Hume that it is, perhaps, unnecessary to say anything more about it. The following very short and plain argument, however, may serve to explain more distinctly the fallacy which seems to have misled those gentlemen.

&gt;Before the discovery of the Spanish West Indies, ten per cent seems to have been the common rate of interest through the greater part of Europe. It has since that time in different countries sunk to six, five, four, and three per cent. Let us suppose that in every particular country the value of silver has sunk precisely in the same proportion as the rate of interest; and that in those countries, for example, where interest has been reduced from ten to five per cent, the same quantity of silver can now purchase just half the quantity of goods which it could have purchased before. This supposition will not, I believe, be found anywhere agreeable to the truth, but it is the most favourable to the opinion which we are going to examine; and even upon this supposition it is utterly impossible that the lowering of the value of silver could have the smallest tendency to lower the rate of interest. If a hundred pounds are in those countries now of no more value than fifty pounds were then, ten pounds must now be of no more value than five pounds were then. Whatever were the causes which lowered the value of the capital, the same must necessarily have lowered that of the interest, and exactly in the same proportion. The proportion between the value of the capital and that of the interest must have remained the same, though the rate had been altered. By altering the rate, on the contrary, the proportion between those two values is necessarily altered. If a hundred pounds now are worth no more than fifty were then, five pounds now can be worth no more than two pounds ten shillings were then. By reducing the rate of interest, therefore, from ten to five per cent, we give for the use of a capital, which is supposed to be equal to one half of its former value, an interest which is equal to one fourth only of the value of the former interest.

&gt;Any increase in the quantity of silver, while that of the commodities circulated by means of it remained the same, could have no other effect than to diminish the value of that metal. The nominal value of all sorts of goods would be greater, but their real value would be precisely the same as before. They would be exchanged for a greater number of pieces of silver; but the quantity of labour which they could command, the number of people whom they could maintain and employ, would be precisely the same. The capital of the country would be the same, though a greater number of pieces might be requisite for conveying any equal portion of it from one hand to another. The deeds of assignment, like the conveyances of a verbose attorney, would be more cumbersome, but the thing assigned would be precisely the same as before, and could produce only the same effects. The funds for maintaining productive labour being the same, the demand for it would be the same. Its price or wages, therefore, though nominally greater, would really be the same",True,False,False,,,0,1575387598,,False,0,{},f9jwpzf,False,t3_e4kopp,False,True,t1_f9hjpp2,/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/e4kopp/capitalist_what_reforms_if_any_would_you_apply_to/f9jwpzf/,False,,1584379952,2,True,False,CapitalismVSocialism,t5_3cct3,r/CapitalismVSocialism,public,0,

[],,DelongPingPong,,,,[],,,,text,t2_53vz7wx7,False,False,[],"DHL yritti samaa jokunen vuosi sitten. Jäin sellaiseen käsitykseen, että ei ole juridisesti pätevä juttu. Kuluttajaviranomainenhan sittemmin puuttui DHL:n pakkomaksuun. Juridinen ongelma tuossa on ymmärtääkseni se, että vastaanottaja ei ole missään sopimussuhteessa postin kanssa ja näin ollen häntä ei voi siihen myös pakottaa. Nuo maksut tulisi periä siis lähettäjältä. Tuohon samaan vetoaa posti itsekkin, jos pyydät heitä vastaanottajana esim. selvittämään miksi lähetys ei ole tullut perille.

Toisekseen, kuten ketjussa on jo mainittu, niin harvassa ovat ne EU:n ulkopuolelta tulevat lähetykset, joissa lähetyksen arvo on merkitty oikein. Useissa Aasialaisissa verkkokaupoissa saa jopa ihan itse valita, paljonko laittavat arvoksi pakettiin.

Postin viimeaikaisten touhujen ja valheiden (esim. postin kilpailijat muka käyttävät halvempaa työsopparia) sekä edellämainittujen seikkojen perusteella on mielestäni ihan perusteltua syytä epäillä kenen etuja posti on laitettu ajamaan? Kansalaisten vai sen kilpailijoiden, sillä jos valtion omistama alan suurin yritys saa pakottaa asiakkaansa yksipuolisiin sopimuksiin ja siirtää koko henkilökuntansa (näinhän he aikoivat vielä kesällä!) halvempien työsopimusten piiriin, niin on ihan päivän selvää, että kaikki muut alan toimijat seuraavat perässä.

Kannattaa myös lukea tuo postin tiedote tarkkaan ja huomioida mitä kieltä siellä käytetään. Esim."" EU:n veroalueen ulkopuolelta saapuville, **pääosin** yli 22 euron  tullaukseen jääville tavaralähetyksille otetaan käyttöön käsittelymaksu."" ja "" Valtaosa Suomeen saapuvista tavaralähetyksistä on pieniarvoisia alle 22 euron lähetyksiä, joita maksu ei koske **tässä vaiheessa**. ""

Tuossa aika hyvin jätetään veräjä auki sille, että tulevaisuudessa rokotetaan vielä lisää.

Selvyyden vuoksi, se että alkavat tarjota jotain vapaaehtoista tullauspalvelua ja rahastavat siitä on mielestäni ihan OK. Se, että vastaanottaja pakotetaan maksamaan yksipuolisesti jotain on mielestäni ehdottoman väärin. Ei se ole meidän vastaanottajien vika, jos postin ylipalkatut johtajat, eivät ole onnistuneet neuvottelemaan parempia kompensaatiomaksuja IPU:ssa.

Tiedotteessa vedotaan myös siihen, että esim. Ruotsissa on otettu ko. maksu käyttöön. Mites siellä kävikään?

&gt; Tiken Jah Fakoly (1968) is a reggae singer from Odienné, Côte d’Ivoire (a.k.a Ivory Coast).

&gt; Tiken Jah was born into a family of griots and christened Doumbia Moussa Fakoly on June 23, 1968 in Odienne, north-western Côte d'Ivoire. He discovered reggae at an early age, assembling his first group, Djelys, in 1987. He became well-known at a regional level, but would soon ascend to national recognition.

&gt; Concerned by the social and political evolution of his country, it was not long before Tiken Jah was writing incisive works on the political environment in Côte d'Ivoire. One such work was on the death of Felix Houphouet-Boigny in 1993, which resulted in a surge of popularity amongst the nation's youth. In 1998, Fakoly made his first international appearance in Paris.

&gt; Tiken Jah Fakoly plays music ""to wake up the consciences"". His music speaks about many injustices done to the people of his country, and those over Africa. As such, African listeners feel a deep affinity with his lyrics as Fakoly speaks for people whom are under oppression. This connection has helped make Tiken Jah Fakoly a much-listened artist throughout both Europe and Africa.

The biggest improvements were education and a partially improved social situation for the peasants, but Russia remained a mostly rural unindustrialized country as it had been in tzarist times.  It was really Stalin's aggressive industrialization that led to rapid growth, though this came at the expense of many people in places like western Ukraine. He was selling grain to finance industrialization while his people starved.  

Because the developed countries in Europe failed to have proletarian revolutions themselves, Stalin turned to the strategy of ""socialism in one country"". This meant rapidly forcing the process of urbanization and industrialization that had occured over a century or more in developed capitalist countries like Britain(accompanied by horrors like the Irish famine).  This process of ""primitive accumulation"" under state capitalism led to rapid growth in the USSR as people left the rural peasant economy and were employed in industrial production.  China's recent growth is an example of this process and has been slowing because it is nearing completion.

Once this ""primitive accumulation"" phase had run its course, the soviet economy stopped catching up with the west, and it became a matter of competition between developed industrial powers over their position in world markets with the West having a massive head start in technology, industrial capacity, and control of foreign markets.  Amidst economic failure brought on by Gorbachev's misguided quasi-market reforms, part of the now well-established and thoroughly corrupted Russian ruling class decided to give up on communism and sell out to the west to enjoy a higher quality of life for themselves.  This worked out great for them, as they became Russia's new oligarch class and enjoyed vastly more wealth than even the most corrupt of the soviet leadership.  Educated professionals did well for themselves as well, and now had the option of emigrating.  The vast majority of the population suffered a steep decline in living standards and the economy as a whole declined until around the time Putin took power.  Many parts of the former Soviet Union still haven't reached the levels of development they had enjoyed in the mid-eighties.

TLDR: The Soviet Union started as a rural peasant economy and grew rapidly through processes similar to Britain in the 19th century or China at the end of the 20th.  Once that was done some time in the late 70's they still couldn't compete with the rest of the entire world and decided to give up.",True,False,False,,,0,1575392791,,False,0,{},f9k4r6e,False,t3_e53v1g,False,False,t1_f9hxpew,/r/history/comments/e53v1g/how_did_russia_get_so_strong_right_after_wwii/f9k4r6e/,False,,1584384707,6,True,False,history,t5_2qh53,r/history,public,0,

In Intro to Public Health classes you learn how to adjust and control for the demographic variables that add variation to a data set, and of course the Harvard researchers who published this work did so. From the [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2775760/) itself: 

&gt;""After additional adjustment for race/ethnicity, income, education, self- and physician-rated health status, body mass index, leisure exercise, smoking, and regular alcohol use, the uninsured were more likely to die (hazard ratio = 1.40; 95% CI = 1.06, 1.84) than those with insurance."" 

You named ""health, age, income, education levels, employment, etc."" as the variables - each of which was controlled for by the study. So your current critique of the study is unreasonable. I'm really not sure what you mean when you say ""the numbers don't add up"". The paper explicitly excluded individuals over 65 for the very reason that they are on Medicare, so again, your concern has been accounted for. Read the study, you'll be hard pressed to suggest they were being careless. Not only that, but this study builds on a body of work that finds the same results (see below for the relevant citations from this paper with their original numbering for your convenience). 

You've made it exceedingly clear that you don't believe removing profit motivations from the healthcare and health insurance industries would be helpful, but I have yet to hear an alternative solution. Not just from you, but from any conservative. The closest you get is in the last line - suggesting importing doctors - but then you end with ""and then see how well their system works"" so I'm not sure whether you want our healthcare to improve or European healthcare to get worse. My guess is that you probably just don't care. After all, being upper middle class likely means you aren't afraid of being bankrupted by medical care. As for your daughter missing out on her dream for the cost of medical school - that's incredibly tragic. I hope one day I can help pay for an education system that can make dreams like hers come true.

In addition, tool marks on the mandible and femur suggested that tongue and thigh meat had been cut off for consumption. 

&gt;The cannibalism at Moula-Guercy wasn’t an isolated incident in prehistory. In the past decade, researchers have reported other evidence that Neanderthals continued eating each other until just before their disappearance.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;That is not true. The EU has always said that it would be open to permanent solutions that would replace the backstop

Are you sure about that? The EU disagrees with you: ""The EU27 will not reopen the Brexit withdrawal agreement"": [January 2019](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-reopen/eu-will-not-reopen-brexit-withdrawal-agreement-diplomat-idUKKCN1PN1Y9?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=topNews), [February 2019](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/STATEMENT_19_903), [June 2019](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/11/no-renegotiation-withdrawal-agreement-french-minister), [July 2019](https://apnews.com/684d9ba48ad54c1f81a1e3146209003f), [November 2019](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/eu-will-not-reopen-brexit-talks-says-donohoe-p7tk0l03v) I don't see them saying they were open to other solutions as they flat out refused to reopen the agreement of which the backstop was a part.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The alternative, when it finally arrived, was the UK essentially putting Northern Ireland in the EU single market permanently (i.e. the EU Commission's original proposal but permanent rather than temporary).

In fact it was exactly the other way around. The original proposal was effectively permanent for the UK, not allowing it to leave the arrangement without the EU agreeing, therefor giving all control to the EU who would have no incentive to let NI go. The current solution gives this control to Stormont and removes EU's veto. In that regard Boris' deal is objectively better than May's deal.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;the EU insists on putting everything into one deal (the WA) to ensure the quid pro quo is clear. You are correct that this is a bargaining tactic.

The EU could've locked in citizens' rights protection but apparently it's more important for the EU to get UK's money than protect the rights of millions of EU citizens living in the UK - allegedly a very high priority for the EU. I get it but I still find it irrational.  If for any reason the UK leaves w/o the WA then the EU will get neither the money, nor citizens' rights protection. Brilliant negotiation tactic indeed.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;a similar thing will happen with the trade deal: the EU will only agree on a comprehensive trade deal if the UK pledges to uphold a level playing field (which means broadly adhering to EU standards and regulation) for the total package

So no trade deal then.

The countries you're pointing at all have better healthcare, more social mobility, happier populations and yes, more taxes. Their programs are to allow more people to get out of poverty, not the lucky few.

It's great that you can earn so much but you're not the norm.

I point at the US system purely because it's a system of extremes (I'm not going to claim to now why others do). It puts individuals ahead of society. That's not to say the whole thing is a dumpster fire - it's a developed nation which instantly puts it ahead of many other countries but to Europeans, we can't help but question. It was founded on separation of church and state but clearly that's been ignored. It was founded based on immigrants but now turns it's back on them. It has so much more money than most European nations but fails to look after its citizens health, happiness and general life.

It seems to come down to how you view your success - was it all your own hard work or is it a result of your education, your health, your happiness, a little bit of luck, your intelligence and upbringing? Those last two you don't get to chose, the first three are what your country provides. The more effort you put in there, the more people you'll see rising from poverty.

I'm in a similar place to you - my view is that the more I earn the happier I am to give back via taxes because I'm comfortable. I don't need to live to excess to be happy.

It's not that we want to shit on the US, it's just that it's so close to greatness, has so much going for it but shits on people while holding up individuals to convince the masses that anyone can make it.

&gt; The Zelensky administration, Ms. Zerkal said, is most concerned about placating Mr. Trump, having decided that the impeachment inquiry will fail in the Senate and that Mr. Trump could be re-elected.

R1- Really depends on what you mean by ""prime."" If you mean before he got his fucking legs chopped off, this will be a much easier fight. 

Assuming before legs chopped off: Ahsoka fought Darth Maul in canon on two occasions (once on Mandalore, and once on the sith planet), so she has some experience fighting Maul. Additionally, this was not the vicious Maul powered by his desire for revenge on Obi-Wan, but the fresh apprentice Maul. At that time in canon, Darth Maul only had one Jedi kill under his belt, specifically of a Jedi apprentice. In legends, he had killed a [retired Jedi who didn't even use a lightsaber but a force enhanced stick](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Siolo_Ur_Manka). She should easily be Maul.

After legs chopped off: This gets a bit murky. Now this Maul has just as much experience fighting Ahsoka as she was fighting him. His eternal quest for revenge powers him, and he has fought and beaten more opponents at this time. This fight could go either way.

R2 - Dooku is a powerful opponent at any stage. He beat Obi-Wan and Anakin in Episode 2, and he beat Anakin multiple times during the Clone Wars. He lost once to Yoda and Anakin but didn't have that many other losses to his name in either canon. Additionally, Ahsoka has never faced him, or another Force Lighting equipped opponent (except the Brother, and I don't think he ever used that against her). Dooku should win.

R3 - This one also heavily depends on which ""Version"" of Grievous we use. If we are talking [the 2D Clone Wars](https://youtu.be/X5t8A0NUCrI?t=223), he is a terrifying Jedi slaying monster whose only loss was in a practice fight with Dooku. Ahsoka doesn't stand a chance. If we are talking about just Clone Wars version, then it will be an easy fight as he was beaten by nearly everyone he fought [including fucking Gungans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT0wSyC1ugQ). His only on screen victories are against a Jedi Padawan and the night sisters.

R4 - Savage is strong, but lacks any kind of finesse. The only Force he knows is brute force. Obi-Wan, Dooku, and Palpatine were all able to exploit his brutish nature to beat Savage. Ahsoka should be able to exploit his brutishness as well.

R5 - I think taking down two trained guards, a blaster wielding general, and two force users at once might be a bit much for Ahsoka, even if they all individually have only mediocre feats.",True,False,False,,,0,1575398857,,False,0,{},f9kenlw,False,t3_e5ki9n,False,True,t3_e5ki9n,/r/whowouldwin/comments/e5ki9n/ahsoka_end_of_rebels_star_wars_vs_various_sith/f9kenlw/,False,,1584390993,4,True,False,whowouldwin,t5_2s599,r/whowouldwin,public,0,
