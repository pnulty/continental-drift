All seasons receive the suffix -*lux* /luks/ which means 'time'.

The hot season is *ceinslux* /ʃəjnsluks/, from *ceins* ""hot, warm"". The hot season is quite intense and a bit long, lasting around 5 months. It's noted by a gradual warming from the retreat season, a total absence of clouds or rain, and long days of intense heat. In most of the country, temperatures easily reach around 32-37C daily and in the southern valleys, temperatures of 30-40C daily are the norm. During this time, crops which are heat-resistant and depend on little water are grown. While the irrigation system of the land is well built, waterways often run dry if not inspected upon frequently. The end of *ceinslux* is brought forth by the raging thunderclouds of the monsoons.

The monsoon season, known as *mahiilux* /mahiːluks/, from *mahii* which can mean ""rain"" or ""June"", as the rains begin around late June. The beginning of *mahiilux* is noted by large, sprawling thunderstorms which last for 18-19 hours each with little time to recuperate. This constant barrage of rainfall goes on for nearly three months, where the monsoon begins to lessen (around mid-September). From mid-September to early November, heavy rainstorms are still frequent but don't last as long. By late November, rains would be reduced to a mere drizzle and by December, the rains halt and the sky remains white and overcast. Seeing the sun is a rare occurence in this season. Temperatures during this season are much more uniform, and are around 25-30C. During this season, crops resistant to flooding and those which thrive in heavy rainfall are planted. Rice, a staple of Anula, is grown in this season within well-drained fields to prevent oversaturation of the soil.

Finally, the retreat season, known as *elirlux* /əlirluks/, from *elir* which means ""going"". This is the shortest season and noticeably the most pleasant, with temperatures lasting around 19-23C. During this season, overcast clouds retreat to reveal the gentle, sunny day. It's akin to spring, and happens around mid-December to mid-January. In this time, work and life halt to a slow pace - it's customary for workers to take long vacations to relax and recuperate their bodies. During this time, *sa yurupta ilruni* /sa jurupta ilɾuni/ ""the European crops"" are grown. Due to the mild weather, crops such as potatoes and greens are grown. They're called European crops because a lot of these were introduced from Europe.

Also use their allies to your advantage. Colonial empires tend to ally weak peeps in the colonial regions. Declare war on them and drag the larger dudes in. 

If you’re Britain, it doesn’t really matter if France gets dragged in when you fight Scotland. Be aware of what are your true goals in a war. In a war against Scotland, your true goals are on the British isles. Focus on that and get warscore. Break their alliances. Not every war involves getting land from someone. Sometimes, just taking money from people, breaking alliances, essentially crippling large empires is a much better tactic.

As England/Britain, you also get union CB against France. I know you want to destroy Castile and take their land, but early on, ally them first. Build up some trust with them and then call them in during your French wars. Allies aren’t permanent. 

If you’re really uncomfortable with wars, there’s another way. European gameplays are really interesting because of the Union mechanics. Take diplo ideas, and spread your dynasty to the other empires. Wait until the countries have no heir or a weak heir and claim their throne and take it. A union partner is much better than a normal vassal. Union partners are much less likely to rebel as long as you have a pretty good level of prestige. 

That said, union mechanics are reserved for the Christian nations. If you want to get land from people and stuff, there’s really only one solution. To sometimes take a calculated risk. If you’re France and you have land right outside ottoman territory. Wait until they declare war against the Mamluks. Wait until they’re around 25% war-score and declare war on them.

Lucas even took from a lot of movies to make his own. In no way was Star Wars a real original idea in the first place. And to be fair, it was his wife at the time who pretty much saved it in the first place. 

That’s not saying I don’t enjoy Star Wars. The series are fun action fantasy movies. I’d consider hyphen some of my favorites. 

What I’m saying is that Star Wars went from movie to cashgrab. Granted a lot of the EU was written by fans, and I appreciate almost everything they did to expand on the simple movies themselves. 

Now that Disney owns it, they have the money to just pound out movie after movie after movie. Even the EU got too much at some point.  It’s over saturation, and that leaves a really bad taste in my mouth.

So you're for redistributing private property? because there a lot of empty, quality houses in the Us or Europe.

More than enough for everyone. No need to build more.

And speaking of building, you do realise some of those regulation have very good reason to be there? Like risk of landslide, flooding or other? same with food regulation and other vital shit.

&gt;Anarcho-capitalism *prevents* others from having control over your critical needs. Heck, *that's the entire point of it*.

So diabetics will have their insulin for free? and not at the hundreds of dollars it's currently at in the US? despite estremely low cost of production? Or that wasn't true capitalism?

And why would people keep the capitalism part? If most thing are going to be local, why bother with bosses?

&gt;will be able to easily find and lay practical claim to a decent spot of land somewhere. There is *so much space* on this planet. We haven't nearly filled it up yet. Not even close.

Again, the fucking planet is ***finite***, not all terrain are viable for construction or agriculture and you need to keep some wilderness for the environment.  Be it land or sea.

Garden like what you have in mind don't produce enough to feed family on a daily basis, you still need to get food from somewhere else. And it take time to care for it.

I would prefer a system where people realise that they need each other and acknowledge that nobody want to die because of a lack of healthcare/starvation/insulin-being-too-costly-despite-having-one-of-the-lowest-production-cost and work together to ensure everybody has a decent quality of life, so they can actually enjoy being alive.

There already more than enough food being produced and there \~10 million people working in the food industry for a population of 327 millions in the us (or  429 079 for 67 millions for France), I'm pretty sure we can organize ourselves to share the work for basic necessities while leaving plenty of free time to those who end up with it.

And there plenty of people doing useless job like banker or the military

Doesn't seem impossible and much better than a system calling for continuous growth on a finite planet

How do you know price will fall and not skyrocket like for the insulin?

How deregulation will ensure better quality and lower price?

Started Stronglifts 5x5 on May 1, 2019. Was using dumbbells. Bought the bar + rack last week, starting the bar slowly - at lower weights than the dumbbells - so as not to teach myself bad form. Will add 5-10 lbs week.

**Career:** Landed 400k in new business yesterday. Just got promoted again, a 10k raise + 10k bonus, now in charge of most of the firm's operations. I've got a staff of 25 or so who work for me now. Boss said I was ""the best thing to ever happen in the firm's history"". Learning to STFU about client + personnel issues in the office, too.  My old work plan was to be ""the gal who can understand and explain client needs"" (and I got really fucking good at that), my new plan is to be ""the gal who can fix any operational issue"", and my inspiration is Harvey Keitel's Winston Wolfe, in *Pulp Fiction*.

**Extracurriculars:** Down to one side business (a rental property) and 2 non-profit boards. Had a state legislator reach out to me yesterday morning for me to help write legislation for next year. Sunday night, a nonprofit director came and asked me to take over the presidency of his nonprofit. I said no. 

**Finance:** Doing just fine.

**Health:** Down to 2 drinks/3 days a week - always with other firm leadership or clients. Getting 7 full nights of sleep a week. 

**Appearance** Second-best dressed gal in the firm.the interns come to me for fashion advice.

**Family:** Taking a leadership role at all times. I have set the family agenda for 4 weekends in a row. Put my daughters in BJJ and it's  paying dividends.Laid out a big board with family priorities and just arranged a trip to the West Coast. Planning a trip to Europe.

When someone commits a crime they go to jail. If a american mom goes to jail she cant take her kids.

Those illegal immigrants know 100% what happens when they cross illegally. They do it because they wont qualify the legal way due to criminal record or just don't wanna wait the years it takes. The illegal immigrants spit in the face of legal immigrants. When the europeans came here to ellis island we sent hundreds of thousands back. This is not a race thing as you claim.

And no. America does try to destroy countries. Read a fucking history book. They did it then, and do it now. Trump promotes ant vaxers..rofl. Trump abandoned the curds..... By leaving syria.... When the curds are located 95% in northern iraq. Its not americas job to police the world. Thats what the u.n. is for.

We don't need to figure out how to get babbies out. Its simple. The illegal immigrants can easily stop bringing them. No one is forcing them to come. 

Also look at the illegral immigrants options. Come to america illegally, go to jail for 2 weeks - 2 months, live in a FREE family housing unit with food tv beds cloths until they are processed. OR go to american embasy/consulate and immigrate legaly taking 2 yrs and tons of money for processing fees. Or come to mexico border at entry point and do it there, pay rent in mexico for 6 months until processed.

A few posts ago you were a great provider (your own words).  Now you're unemployed, broke and living with your parents.  Which is it?  If it's the latter, you can definitely do something about that.

`If you think that dying alone is no big deal, then you try it. Try isolating yourself for even a couple weeks and see how you feel.`

I actually live alone by glorious and wondrous choice.  Last month I spent a couple of weeks traveling Japan (where I didn't speak the language) alone.  A few years ago I spent three months riding my bicycle across Europe (lots of languages I didn't speak) alone.  It was the best three months of my life.  In all seriousness, if you have hobbies, interests and passions to pursue, you never get lonely.  Again, try it before dissing it because of some shit you read on the Internet.

`What exactly is that something? Because I really have no idea how to even start looking given what I am looking for.`

Well the first thing you'll need to do is change your attitude and put an end to the pity party.  I've met quite a few conservative virgin girls in my life (none that I wanted to marry, but that's just a personal choice), and I can honestly say that none of them would have had any interest in a guy who's life revolves around reading depressing shit on the Internet and arguing with strangers on the Internet.  Honestly, they wouldn't even stick around long enough to find out that you're unemployed and living with your parents.  Right now you seem so determined to be depressed that you're achieving it through sheer force of will.  Try directing your will power somewhere else.

`It's fine if you're unequipped to help. But then the least you can stop twisting the knife.`

Nobody's forcing you to read it.  Plenty of other things you could be doing with your time.

The simple fact is that the only person equipped to help you is you.  There is no golden nugget of advice that a person can give you that will magically solve all of your problems.  You're going to have to do thing that might make you uncomfortable.  Some times you'll try things that won't work or will blow up in your face.  That's a good thing, because that's how we learn and grow as people.  Ultimately, it's up to you to get off your computer or phone or whatever your posting on, and try something.

It's a crappy, overpriced course claiming to be something it's not. It's exactly the kind of thing we try to steer people away from.

&gt; So I’m trying to compare TESL Canada’s standards to the CELTA.

Unless you actually want to teach in Canada, TESL Canada accreditation means nothing whatsoever. People outside Canada neither know nor care about country-specific accreditation. In any case, big-name certificates such as the Celta will be accepted in Canada.

If your goal is to teach in Europe, you should invest in a certificate from a provider employers are familiar with.

It's not hard to do, but it's labor intensive. On both our cars you have to pull both front drive axles, disconnect the engine supports, lower the engine and gear assembly (gearbox bolted to engine and holds in flywheel/clutch), drain remaining gearbox oil (3-6 liters), unbolt gearbox and lower it (Suzuki weighs nothing Ish, ford weighs 40 kg). Now you can clean up the gearbox for debris like in this picture, and I strongly fucking advice that you replace any hydraulic slave cylinders while you are in here (!!!!) and probably do the pilot bearing too. The clutch itself is bolted to the flywheel and needs to be aligned PERFECTLY using an alignment tool i.e. not hard to do, just time intensive. Every single adjustment needs retorque-ing all bolts in that a pattern, before you hoist the gearbox back up and attempt to wiggle the drive shaft into the tiny hole on the clutch so it aligns and engages. Finally you redo the bolts on the clutch housing / gear assembly, torque them down, raise the engine assembly, reinstall drive shafts, reinstall engine mounts, fill up gearbox oil, probably bleed the hydraulic clutch system if you did that (you should) and finally... You can attempt to start the vehicle and pray it fucking works!!!

I've been told that many cars are much worse because the AC line sometime goes under the gearbox assembly and needs to be disconnected. My professional cousin says it takes him 8-12 hours in a shop for most FWD clutch changes. 

The clutch (with pressure plate) itself is $70 for non original. Add $20 for hydraulic slave, and $5 for hydraulic oil, and $20 for gear oil. Double those for OEM parts on normal vehicles, triple for exotic fancy cars. 

So yeah. To give a real life example, we usually paid $1000-$1500 for a clutch change on our cars before I learned to do it.

Consider where you are staying.  Okay, you have a room with a private bathroom.  It’s probably small, but you  have a personal attendant.  How basic do you want it?  What price would you put on that?

Next might be food.  You’ll have access to a huge variety of food (maybe 24/7?) and you won’t have to pay for it each time you eat.  You’ll also have access to basic drinks.  What might that cost if had to pay separately every meal?

What types of entertainment will you have free access to?  Swimming pool? (That comes free with a lot of hotels, so maybe ignore that, but is there a water park element as well?  That might usually cost you extra)...what about Cabaret shows/cinema etc?  Those would cost extra if based in a single location so assign a cost to it.

Day trip.  So I’m not talking about additional cost excursions.  I’m talking about getting in a car and visiting other towns and cities nearby.  You would likely have fuel and parking costs...the Ship is taking care of that for you and taking you from place to place.  You don’t have to drive, you fall asleep one night and wake up at port the next morning.  What is that worth to you?

Another thing to factor in is the relaxation part.  I had my first cruise this year and it was the very first time I could truly switch off.  Because I didn’t have to think about reading maps to get from A to B, I didn’t have to think about finding restaurants when I felt hungry, I didn’t have to pack and unpack my case or check in to a new hotel every day we went somewhere different.  The Ship did everything for me.  Bliss!

Tot everything up and see if it comes close to what the cost of your cruise could be. I did this for my cruise this year, and actually I felt I came out of it with a bloody bargain (I opted for a basic budget priced bedroom but got the top alcohol drinks package as well which included the daily gratuity fee so I didn’t have any surprise costs by end of cruise). It ended up as an equivalent of $140 per person per day for us (it was a small cruise ship travelling through Europe, no bells and whistles).

Edit: Pre-planned excursions.  So everyone will say about how you can do them cheaper yourself.  Yes that’s true, but if you miss your final boarding time back on Ship you are screwed.  If the Ship does an excursion and it gets delayed getting back (because of traffic or incident) the Ship can’t leave without you as it’s their tour.  I did ship excursions for my first cruise and yes, expensive, but you often skip lines because part of a group and you get to see further a field because the tour knows where to take you rather than you having to research and arrange personal travel",True,False,False,,,0,1575188883,,1575189222,0,{},f999vix,False,t3_e4cogf,False,True,t3_e4cogf,/r/Cruise/comments/e4cogf/prices/f999vix/,False,,1584188596,1,True,False,Cruise,t5_2qm8s,r/Cruise,public,0,

I'm getting a massive payrise next year, about £1000+, agreed by a Tory government which actually for once looked after the lowest paid (provoking the higher paid NHS workers to threaten the deal and hold it up for a few months while the unions threw their dummies out of the pram). 

It would be political suicide for anyone to actually threaten the NHS; there are problems (stemming from the fact that no-one pays directly for care, the system regularly gets overwhelmed, and most European countries have some form of pooled-risk insurance systems that provide good coverage at an equitable standard) but when you are at the coalface, all the 'Tories are trying to privatise the NHS' bollocks is a bit laughable.

Hence why I actually and fundamentally *don't care*. And I live in this country and know exactly what's going on. My husband had fabulous care while he was alive, we have a very caring hospice service for when he died, and if you sat in my office for a day or two you'd see how the whole shebang holds together despite the comings and goings of politicians. It works. Every system has its downsides and upsides; the American system is a mirror image of ours. While ours is free to all but might not be sustainable in the long run with the ever-increasing cost of advanced 21st century medicine, yours actually acknowledges the high cost of modern healthcare but can't square the equitable provision circle. It's the same problem: how to provide what is an exceedingly expensive thing as a human right. And despite what you might have heard, there are no easy answers, but neither is it evil cackling Tories vs nice cuddly Labour.

&amp;#x200B;

They were both largely pre-industrial at the time of their revolutions- China in particular felt that the need to industrialize was an existential threat they needed to overcome in order to survive in the face of western imperialism. This led both countries to overvalue hitting industrial benchmarks in a short timespan and led to a lot of bad decisions that wouldn't happen in an already-industrialized economy. Furthermore, the centralized system they both adopted was originally seen as a stopgap measure, stage one in a two stage revolution, intended to transform the capitalist state into a communist one, but it in and of itself was not the ideal that they hoped for. It was a compromise plan. Communism was envisioned as the kind of society that would follow capitalism, which itself followed feudalism. The advances of capitalism would greatly increase production, but those gains would be unevenly distributed, with the idea being that Socialism would redistribute things so that everyone could share in them.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that Russia and China jumped the gun and set off revolutions before they had really experienced the gains of capitalism at all. Both were barely out of a feudal society at the time, still having massive amounts of uneducated peasants and little industrial capacity. They didn't have enough stuff to redistribute. The centralized command economy they implemented was just them trying to play catch-up. That's why you had them ordering city dwellers to go out to work farms in the countryside or peasant farmers to try and smelt iron in their yards. They were trying to brute force the growth of their economy but just ended up creating a bunch of inefficiencies and breaking the system they already had. They may have felt that need to hurry due to their individual situations, but that's not a tenet of socialism.

&amp;#x200B;

On top of that, they entered this coming out of violent, ideologically driven revolutions. Ideological purity was demanded, meaning that they had to immediately implement huge changes like outlawing private ownership of land, stuff that massively disrupted their existing food supply. That's not a symptom of socialism, that's a symptom of ideologically driven revolutions. They tend to put violent, paranoid revolutionaries in positions of power. Even if they were good at being a revolutionary, that doesn't mean that they'll be good at being the head of government. That's why you had stuff like Mao's stupid Four Pests Campaign. Being a bad leader is not a socialist tenet. They can have good leaders, and capitalist states can have bad ones. There are plenty of examples in capitalist societies where you've had farmers wreck their soil by overfarming cash crops or had landlords ship food away to sell elsewhere while the local population starve.

&amp;#x200B;

Did I mention that both these examples are of countries with a single-party system that suffered from high corruption both before and after the revolution? None of that is inherently socialist.

&amp;#x200B;

There are plenty of examples where countries have adopted socialist ideas and succeeded. Scandanavian-style social democracy is the best known (and consistently tops the global happiness index), but there are countries that have nationalized certain industries (usually oil) around the world. Bolivia was looking like a success story until its recent right-wing coup. The term ""socialism"" encompasses a whole range of systems, and the marxist-leninism of the USSR that was adopted or adapted by the most famous communist states is just one example. With a broader definition you could even look at smaller scale implementations like farmer co-ops, worker-owned businesses, or the commons that were the basis of European agriculture prior to enclosure as all being successful forms of socialism.

&amp;#x200B;

People hear ""socialism"" and think that it means an authoritarian government with no guarantees of personal freedoms with no innovation, no markets, no surpluses, no democracy, but none of that has to be the case. All it really means deep down is your boss and/or landlord probably sucks and you should get paid more.

I should have been clearer. Undoubtedly, Christians have suffered as much as Muslims in particular ways (because we all live in the same country/region), but I do believe Muslims have had (and continue to have) it worse. 

In the Palestinian case, it's easy: they lost their country (and Palestinians are overwhelmingly Muslim). In the Lebanese case, there's a little more to be said, but even a rudimentary overview of the country's economics, as well as one of current political relations involving sects and regional powers, doesn't seem to support the narrative that Christians are a persecuted minority. For example, look at the current relations of the Christian parties: though the LF/Kataeb are opposed to Hezbollah, the FPM are allied with them. This puts Christians in a relatively comfortable position, since the strongest (Shia) Muslim faction is allied to some of them. Sure, Christians had much more power a few decades ago, but they're far from powerless today (and they're doing much better than Sunnis). Also, whenever there's a war between Israel and Lebanon, Christian areas are rarely bombed. That's a tangible benefit of being Christian. Finally, if you look at the socioeconomic standards across the sects, Christians (and Druze) are doing better than everyone else. The Shia Muslims have recently gotten a lot of help from Iran, but they (and especially the Sunnis) are still the poorest in the country.

Though I don't think Christians have had it easy, the idea that they're persecuted has about as much weight behind it as the idea that Europe is being taken over by Muslims.

Oh yeah, that's why Hitler let 300 000 British soldiers go at the battle of Dunkirk in favor of making peace with Britain, when he could have just ended the war right there. 

Or why he allowed Britain to bomb Germany for 3 months before finally retaliating.

Or why he sent numerous peace offers to Britain that were all declined, so he had to go to the Vatican to get them to reason with Britain which was a majority Christian nation, and whose peace offer was also declined by Churchill and his cabinet.

Germany's fight wasn't with Europe, it was against the international Jewry which had declared war on them and the bolsheviks which were getting ready to invade Europe and cause more genocides like the Holodomor.

In the process those agents, whose work touches every aspect of the commerce of football, got in at the ground floor to build business relationships with a new wave of non-traditional, non-European private owners of clubs attracted by the possibility football offers of moving money seamlessly, frictionlessly and almost untouchably across international borders and into the hands of private individuals in exchange for no tangibles beyond the papers used to draw up contractual agreements. That offers considerable benefits to organisations and individuals whose wealth and power, and means of maintaining them, require discretion to the point of outright secrecy. In short Portugal was open for business, and its state was soft on football corruption and tax evasion; it offered access to highly desirable Brasilian talent and the most powerful agents in the game; come the 00s it was associated with Ronaldo, the biggest brand, the biggest face, in football.

Taking this opportunity enabled Portugese-based operators to mesh with the emergently hegemonic ownership networks that are stitching up football at present, and which they have assisted in dominating the commerce of football transfers in the EU increasingly over the last 15 years.

Even Gordon Brown's modest public spector spending increases were based on taxing the results of economic growth. There's going to be zero cash for your Big Left Project. Not that it would matter, because as you can see from his enormous polling shortfall, one of two things has happened.

either:

a) refusing to take a stance on an issue of key significance to his constituents hasn't worked out the way you'd expected. Do you remember how the Lib Dems were polling when Corbyn took over? Would they have recovered and be splitting the Labour vote today if Corbyn had taken the lead on the issue? What platform would they even be running on?

or possibly:

b) the majority of the public wants no part in your Big Left Project. (This may be because the British electorate is center-right, this dream has never successfully been implemented anywhere in the world, and France literally failed to make work when they tried it just a few years ago). If that's so you've just handed government to the conservatives (and all the consequences that will entail on public services) for a decade over a whimsical utopian fantasy.

Even McDonnell admits that no party has yet recovered from being this low in the polls and that Corbyn will have to stand down if this election is lost. So there's pretty much a 99% likelihood we're gonna be hit by the quintuple whamy: a) European economic shock b) no Big Left Project ever c) Massive public sector cuts and privatisations. d) The implications for worker protections and the environment that will be the quid pro quo for the American trade deal we'll have to negotiate as a small nation with no collective clout e) Losing the Human Rights Act, environmental regulation and constitutional perks that came from EU membership.

Also what does Obama have to do with this? Obama may have gotten little done, but Gordon Brown changed the lives of millions of people at the bottom of the income scale. You seem to think there's no difference between not having your 'Big Left Project' and undending right-wing rule? Doesn't the record of austerity show exactly what costs are of throwing elections away to the right? It amazes me that you think you're championing the interests of the poor with your utopian fantasy when you've quite literally doomed them.

Bismarck's genius political skills had navigated the new German Nation into the middle of a web of tedious alliances. After the assassination, the growing military conflict caught the strings of these alliances and began pulling everyone into war. The Germans new their situation is precarious, pinched between the Russians and the French, and so they mobilized as rapidly as possible in an attempt to win the war before it began in earnest. But they were wrong, the would-be enemy had also already begun to mobilize against Germany.

Now I'm not sure where you're signing Germany with the prime cause of WWI. Was it Bismarck's treaties? It certainly wasn't the mobilization of military forces, the Ottoman Empire had everyone beat there. It certainly wasn't intention to conquer, the Germans we're trying to prevent the French and the Russians from destroying them. Maybe it's because they were the only effective power in their shitty alliance. 

Or maybe we should just blame it on the French. If they hadn't been so concerned with destroying German power, Germany would not have been forced to defend itself, Germany would not have built the Grand Army, would not have forged such a tangled web of alliances, would not have been destroyed in the first world war, would not have become the breeding ground for extremist political thought.

It's for batter spouses if US citizens. And you can apply for a green card that way.

I would document In a journal that you keep secret the days and times of all the times he mentally abuses you and quote friends who or neighbors that can testify how little he spends with the kids and how he is mentally unstable in a way. I agree he's trying to declare you mentally unfit I would from now on be very thoughtful of your actions and or get a separate phone that records maybe with a visa gift card or something you can buy at the grocery store and that way there is no trace of a phone on any receipt. And start to secretly record him during these moments he is acting out or even admits to his bad behavior.

Just because your not a citizen doesn't mean you don't have rights find a free consultation with a good lawyer look around maybe even look around at some nearest the places you busy regularly do a Google search in your nearest area next time your out Google can do that. Open up maps and search immigration lawyer. Afterward go into your Google account settings and delete your search ok so he can't find it. Do not let it on you know. 

If you can get a lock box at a bank and your own mail box at the post office that you can also pay for with a bias gift card you buy at the grocery store and all your mail that's needed to leave Willi only go to this lock box at the mail post office that you have a key for and when you do grocery shopping go check your mail. Look into these things. I hope you update soon. If you have more questions I'll try my best to answer ok. Good luck to you and no this is not ok to live like this he's a ticking time bomb either he hurts your later or leaves you later when your helpless or you can grab this situation by the horns and be in charge of your life and make it a better one for your kids. Also if you got a green card from your marriage just because you divorce doesn't mean you get kicked out I've read this multiple times the only problem is the job situation and the place to stay. See if any Family members would be willing to send you a start up loan for a apartment after you get a job.

Edited to add. I also think he's keeping the kids from her when their fighting as a way to hurt or punish her and control her to stop bothering him.

Foi assim que David Merritt descreveu seu filho Jack Merritt, de 25 anos, que foi esfaqueado até a morte em um [ataque na London Bridge, na região central de Londres](https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/internacional-50613882).

Uma mulher que também morreu no ataque, que foi descrito pela polícia como um caso de terrorismo, ainda não foi identificada. Outras três pessoas ficaram feridas.

Graduado em direito e criminologia, Merritt foi coordenador, na Universidade de Cambridge, do programa de reabilitação prisional.

O projeto Learning Together (em Português, ""aprendendo juntos"") oferece a estudantes e detentos a oportunidade de estudarem juntos, para ajudar a reduzir a reincidência. Merritt tinha um ""profundo compromisso"" com essa área, segundo pessoas que trabalharam com ele.

Uma vigília foi realizada em Cambridge, cidade de Merritt, no sábado (30), dia seguinte ao ataque. 

Em um post no Twitter que foi deletado, o pai de Merritt escreveu: ""Meu filho Jack, que foi morto neste ataque, não gostaria que sua morte fosse usada como pretexto para sentenças mais draconianas ou para deter pessoas sem necessidade"".

Em uma visita ao local do ataque, o primeiro-ministro, Boris Johnson, disse que a prática de reduzir à metade as penas de prisão e deixar infratores violentos saírem cedo ""simplesmente não está funcionando"". Ele defendeu ""endurecer sentenças"", enquanto o líder do partido trabalhista, Jeremy Corbyn, disse que ainda há perguntas a serem respondidas.

Com [eleições gerais marcadas para 12 de dezembro](https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/internacional-50214696) no Reino Unido, partidos políticos cancelaram alguns eventos no sábado. Bandeiras nos prédios do governo do Reino Unido foram hasteadas a meio mastro, como um sinal de respeito às vítimas do ataque.

A rainha Elizabeth 2ª disse em um comunicado: ""O príncipe Philip e eu ficamos tristes ao saber dos ataques terroristas em London Bridge. Enviamos nossos pensamentos, orações e simpatias mais profundas a todos aqueles que perderam entes queridos e que foram afetados pela terrível violência de ontem (sexta)"".

Amigos, familiares e aqueles que trabalharam com Merritt têm prestado homenagens.

'Bom demais para este mundo'
----------------------------

Emilee Hopper, que disse ter sido amiga de Merritt na escola, o descreveu como ""uma das pessoas mais gentis que já conheci e uma alma bonita"".

Daisy Knock disse que Merritt era ""bom demais para este mundo"".

""Ele trabalhou e acreditou em algo que um dia mudará a forma como vemos o mundo"", acrescentou.

Outra amiga disse que Merritt, graduado pela Universidade de Manchester e pela Universidade de Cambridge, era ""incrivelmente inteligente, com mais alegria de viver do que muitos da nossa idade e mais determinação em deixar sua marca no mundo"".

   Direito de imagem Reprodução/Twitter   Image caption  'Não posso acreditar que ele foi tirado de sua família dessa forma e sempre, sempre vou lembrar como ele viveu e não como ele morreu', escreveu uma amiga em rede social.       O rapper britânico Dave disse que Merritt era ""o melhor cara"" e as notícias sobre sua morte eram ""uma das coisas mais dolorosas"".

O álbum de Dave que venceu o Mercury Prize foi inspirado na terapia de reabilitação que seu irmão Christopher Omoregie recebeu enquanto cumpria pena de prisão perpétua por assassinato.

O rapper nascido em Streatham disse que Merritt ""dedicou sua vida a ajudar os outros"". E afirmou: ""foi genuinamente uma honra conhecer alguém como você"".

Dave disse que ""nunca esqueceria"" tudo o que Merritt tinha ""feito por nós"".

   Direito de imagem Getty Images   Image caption  O rapper Dave dedicou seu premiado álbum Psychodrama a seu irmão, que está na prisão   Integrantes da comunidade de justiça criminal disseram estar ""em choque profundo"" pela morte de Merritt.

A Prison Radio UK, que trabalha com prisioneiros e várias organizações para identificar os problemas mais importantes enfrentados por esse público, elogiou o jovem de 25 anos por sua ajuda com um podcast que explica leis aos presos.

""Ele era generoso com seu tempo e feliz demais em ajudar os outros. Sua vida deve inspirar a todos nós.""

O comentarista de assuntos jurídicos Joshua Rozenberg entrevistou Merritt para a BBC em fevereiro, quando ele estava trabalhando com o Learning Together no HMP Warren Hill, em Suffolk.

Rozenberg o descreveu como ""um bom jovem, dedicado a melhorar a vida das pessoas"".

Tim Storrie, advogado que também disse que conheceu Merritt em Warren Hill, disse que ele ""salvou vidas por meio de seu trabalho"".

""Seu coração aberto, sua determinação e sua fé na redenção de prisioneiros através da educação brilharam"", acrescentou.

A procuradora Audrey Ludwig disse que ""seu profundo compromisso com a educação e a reabilitação de prisioneiros foi profundamente impressionante"".

""Eu presto condolências à família dele, amigos e ao grupo de prisioneiros"", acrescentou.

O ataque
--------

O ataque começou no início da tarde da sexta-feira no Fishmongers 'Hall, no extremo norte da London Bridge, onde uma conferência sobre reabilitação de prisioneiros estava ocorrendo e da qual Khan estava participando.

Tudo começou dentro do prédio, antes de prosseguir para a ponte, onde Khan foi detido por membros do público antes de ser baleado pela polícia.

    Dois homens foram vistos segurando o agressor e um homem foi visto se afastando segurando uma faca grande que haviam recuperado.

Um homem e uma mulher foram mortos durante o ataque e três outras pessoas (um homem e duas mulheres) também ficaram feridos e estão no hospital.

O jornalista da BBC John McManus, que estava na região, disse que viu um grupo de homens brigando na ponte. A polícia então chegou e houve troca de tiros, disse ele.

""Eu estava andando pela London Bridge na parte sul em direção à parte norte. Parecia haver uma briga do outro lado da ponte, com vários homens atacando um homem. A polícia então chegou rapidamente, inclusive polícia armada, e vários tiros foram disparados em direção ao homem"", disse McManus ao canal da BBC News.

- Medicare for all will lower healtcare costs for the majority of people, freeing capital to spend on other stuff
- Higher minimum wage will lead to more spending (by individuals) and therefore a healthy economy

It's not arbitrary to look at form over different stretches of time. I'm not saying SKT's placing was wrong or anything, just that by the time playoffs rolled around they were very dominant, and had been for a while.

To be clear, I don't disagree that LCK is better than LEC, I just disagree that it's more competitive (or at least in the way you're saying) because I think SKT were the best team in Korea by a wide margin.

I think it's probably true that Korea has like 5 or 6 teams that could have come 3rd in Europe, but I still think Korea was SKT &gt; the rest, to a similar degree that Europe was G2 &gt; the rest, by Worlds. And all this wonky reasoning about scrim results and stuff is exactly the sort of nonsense we used to (rightly) ridicule western fanboys for.

The results are what matter. Maybe Damwon could have beat anyone, but maybe Fnatic in 2015 should have beat ROX tigers too. Maybe TSM could have beaten anyone except SSW in 2014. Maybe Samsung beating SKT 3-0 in 2017 was a one-in-a-thousand fluke.

But what being good at LoL means is being good at winning LoL tournaments, and the LEC has produced 2 world-class teams (in terms of results) in the last 2 years, which only share 1 player between the rosters, so the idea that it's just G2 isn't really true.

You sound like a real seeker of understanding and truth.

&gt;I'll explain like you're 5 ...and who knows, maybe you are.

Oooh, yeah, try to insult me, that'll warm me up and bolster your argument.

&gt;
&gt;First, I'll back up. You've heard of the Little Ice Age? The abnormally cool period in the 1300s and 1400s? It coincided with the Bubonic plague, which dropped Europe's populations by 1/3. With all those people dying in a largely agrarian society, farm fields went fallow, then began to tree over. Consult any historical CO2e chart - there's a downtick in atmospheric CO2 as all the trees absorb carbon. It's a leading theory as to why the Littke Ice Age happened

No it's not a leading theory. You definitely aren't studying this enough with quality sources/educational background if that's what you believe. The IPCC disagrees as well and essentially states: 

""....the timing and areas affected by the Little Ice Age suggested largely independent regional climate changes rather than a globally synchronous increased glaciation. At most, there was modest cooling of the Northern Hemisphere during the period.""

Some further reading: https://www.eh-resources.org/little-ice-age/

&gt;
&gt;Maybe you should attempt to think this through.
&gt;
&gt;Maybe you should read the study that found areas for these 500 billion trees - they are all areas outside of cities and existing agricultural land, where it's possible to grow trees. Fertilization might help in some cases, and if ya didn't know, certain Canadian provinces are already certifying carbon reductions via fertilization to improve tree growth in stands long-term.
&gt;
&gt;Yep, I definitely didn't think it through.

You haven't, here's why:

https://www.discovermagazine.com/planet-earth/we-cant-just-plant-billions-of-trees-to-stop-climate-change

Lastly, twice you've sidestepped a key problem (and many of them really....) with planting all of those trees. The emissions came from the ground and were sequestered there for millions of years. We can't sequester them back onto the surface and not have the re-release when they decay. It's just not possible. Furthermore many of these areas aren't perfect for 'trees'.

We can use trees as part of the mix to reduce CO2 but they'll always be a bomb waiting to go off. A rapid reduction to net zero emissions is needed, not ill-advised feel good measures.

The Franco-Prussian War is also fascinating, with great personalities such as Bismarck, Wilhelm I and Napoleon III, with Prussia basically crushing and humiliating France and bombarding Paris - leading to the bombastic unification of Germany at Versailles on the one hand and the bloody anarchy of the Paris Commune on the other, setting the stage for World War I.

And for a movie not directly about a war, I find the Regency Period of the UK to be extremely fascinating. A politically rather uncertain and chaotic time. With Napoleon still around, a crazy, blind and dying old king, and a drunken, immoral and irresponsible Prince Regent. But at the same time with so many young literary geniuses, like Jane Austen, Mary Shelley, Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Keats and Lord Byron all basically writing at the same time. The British Romantic Era as a whole is very fascinating, with besides its amazing literature also created a blossoming of new, progressive ideals well ahead of their time.",True,False,False,,,0,1575212006,,False,0,{},f9belsv,False,t3_e4aj8n,False,True,t3_e4aj8n,/r/movies/comments/e4aj8n/what_are_historical_events_you_want_to_be_the/f9belsv/,False,,1584227328,5,True,False,movies,t5_2qh3s,r/movies,public,0,

Boris Johnson has widened his lead over Jeremy Corbyn to 10 points, amid a further fall in support for the Brexit Party, according to a poll. 

A Savanta ComRes survey for The Sunday Telegraph puts the Conservatives on 43 per cent, a two point rise since early last week. 

Labour and the Brexit Party have each dropped by one point to 33 per cent and 4 per cent respectively, while the Liberal Democrats remained on 13 per cent. 

Writing in The Sunday Telegraph,  Sir John Curtice, the veteran psephologist, said the findings suggested that an ""apparent erosion of the Conservative position may now have come to a halt."" 

The survey of 2,025 people also demonstrated support for a tough stance on the second phase of the Brexit negotiations. 

Some 41 per cent said that if the EU and the UK fail to agree to a trade deal by the end of next year, the UK should end the transition without an agreement - compared to 27 per cent who disagreed. 

On Friday Mr Johnson confirmed that a Conservative-led government would remain in a ""state of readiness"" for a no-deal Brexit - an outcome Mr Corbyn has said must be taken off the table. 

The poll also showed that a majority of voters believed that the Conservatives would handle the economy competently. 

By contrast only 27 per cent agreed that a government led by Mr Corbyn would handle the economy competently, while 54 per cent disagreed. 

According to the survey, 70 per cent of those who voted to leave the EU currently support the Conservatives, while Labour is the most popular party among Remain voters, receiving 48 per cent of their votes.  

Around 23 per cent of those who voted Remain in 2016 are planning to vote for the Liberal Democrats. Last week Sir John warned that the Conservatives ""seemingly comfortable"" lead would ""soon be reduced if the Remain vote were to coalesce behind Labour."" 

However, 54 per cent of those intending to vote LibDem are not confident that a Labour government under Jeremy Corbyn would handle the economy competently, the Savanta ComRes poll found. 

The survey was conducted online between Wednesday and Thursday. 

The current vote shares would result in a Conservative majority of 42, according to projections by Electoral Calculus. 

The Brexit Party would not win any seats. 

On Saturday, Sir Vince Cable, the former Lib Dem leader, admitted that the party's policy to revoke the Article 50 notice period for leaving the EU, was ""a distraction and not a very helpful one.""

You’re right. The more diverse, the more time and effort is required. But it can be done. Time is the only factor.

You claim Labour want state control of everything. Labour actually want to nationalise a few key pieces of infrastructure, because they're natural monopolies anyway. Openreach, for example, already takes significant government subsidies, yet is a private profit making company. There is only one other option for broadband infrastructure and it's nowhere near competitive, so this isn't exactly a good example of free markets driving innovation and quality or whatever.

In reality, a Labour government will bring us slightly higher taxes, disproportionately affecting the well off and very wealthy, in return for much needed investment, revitalising the country and saving lives.

You are simply regurgitating propaganda you picked up from some echo chamber.... socialism has absolutely nothing to do with the ""means of production"". What it is, is a totalitarian system of governance wherein the nation's citizenry is subjugated to the extreme, with government using military force to  dominate/assume direct control over transportation, communication, the private sector, resources, property and military arms. 

What I described is consistent in all forms of socialism without exception by the way.

&gt;""Real"" socialists wouldn't call the **socialists** socialists.

Textbook 'No true scotsman' fallacy.

Also you  have no understanding of what socialism even is, making the above quoted extremely nonsensical.

&gt;There were times that Hitler also called himself a socialist.

You mean when he would explcitly say ""*I am a socialist.*"" and was the head of the socialist party using socialist tactics, socialist iconography, a socialist system of governance and socialist rhetoric ?

I guess that's just one massive coincidence. /s

&gt; he was also a notorious liar

So was Stalin, so was Mao, so was Trotsky, so was Castro, so was Chavez, so was Pol Pot..... the above quoted again exposes you as having absolutely no idea what you're talking about.

&gt;The Nazis were some sort of crazy ad hoc third way hybrid. 

You're thinking of The Third Position which never actually happened probably due to the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact leading into WWII.

They never got past national socialism ----&gt; The Third Position.

&gt; they aren't or weren't socialists

You are incorrect.

Aboriginal and indigenous are catch-all terms for First Nations, Metis and Inuit. We are distinct groups of people who have our own unique culture, heritage and way of life. 

Section 35 of the constitution act of 1982 states the aboriginal peoples of Canada are First Nations, Metis and Inuit.

Being Metis does not mean you are first nations. We are a nation of people who emerged and no longer saw ourselfs and European or First Nations. This is called ethnogenisis where two cultures merge together to form one. It is not unique to Metis it has happened all over the world  at different points in time. 

Our ancestors created this nation and it should be something we should be proud of. We respect our first nations cousins but we are not them. We are our own unique Nation. My ancestors fought for Metis rights. They fought for our identity. My last First Nation ancestor was in the 1700's after that they have identified proudly as Metis and we continue to do so.

[],,Kaitanno,,,,[],,,,text,t2_52x818ct,False,False,[],"I’ll take the points one by one in an effort to keep it concise for your time:

1. Its a common misconception that supermarkets sell firearms, it’s also a large misconception that doing so is just as easy as picking up groceries. 

In fact, getting a firearm on the deepweb is not nearly as difficult as it seems and much easier than doing it the legal way in all cases. All you need is the free downloadable browser, and the easily findable link to the deepweb wiki. From there you will find a plethora of easily accessible links to purchase illegals firearms anywhere in the world for about $200. 

2. In the USA medical malpractice and alcohol are also heavily regulated with laws. Having laws on the books generally is a bad form of argumentation for prevention, not to take a personal swipe at you by any means. When is the last time a criminal was documented saying “it was illegal so I decided I couldn’t do it.” Laws don’t actively work to prevent anything, this is a big misconception by the majority of people. Laws stand in majority as a slight *moral deterrent* and mainly for prosecution purposes.

This would also be in stark contrast to Europe as a whole. America has the highest rates of survival for ailments such as cancer, and has the most advanced and cutting edge technology for a large portion of diseases. Far higher than all of Europe combined. That’s why people from Europe come here for cancer treatment, and experimental life saving treatments for all kinds of diseases. It’s not a knock on the European medical system, it’s just the truth.

3. As for this point I’m not sure what you’re advocating. If you’re advocating for the removal of firearms from citizens I believe I already made a strong case against that in the previous comment. If you are advocating for more “common sense” measures, then why not advocate for enforcement of laws that are *already present on the books*, the data shows empirically, strict gun laws have no effect on violent crime or gun crime in America. This can also be argued for Europe as a whole. It’s a fallacy to compare the USA to one European country at a time, the reason being is that America as a whole is *correct me if I’m wrong* close to 502million km^2 and the entirety of Europe is roughly 500million km^2. The population of both Europe and America are fairly similar when compared this way as well, and the data would actually show, that for Europe as a whole, gun laws there haven’t worked well either in comparison. There’s a redditor who went through and documented all major violent crimes in European countries from Germany to France etc... before and after gun laws took place it shows that not only did they have no noticeable effect, in many cases violent crimes increased in number. 

Why everyone over there thinks that Europe is a  bastion of safety and America is the Wild West? I don’t know, you’ll have to take that up with your media companies providing you the “news”. Not as a low blow to you personally, but anyone who is privy to this knowledge thinks Europe is a joke for 1st world country standards.

4. I agree with you, there is a massive culture problem in America. Not to be insensitive, but I believe I already made this point, if you remove suicide and gang violence, gun deaths drop to a statistical anomaly in the USA. This is not meant to be a dismissive argument towards the problem, but it *is* meant to be a dismissive argument against gun control. So like I said, when the many are judged for the actions of a few, everyone loses.

People don’t want to admit it, but we have a problem with mental health and a culture problem in minority communities. Gang violence is glorified in music, movies, games, and media. It proliferates the communities where poverty is common and many times those involved believe they have no other choice. The real solution here is to invest back into these communities, bring jobs and opportunities back, and invest into their economies where small businesses can thrive again. Not to take a blow at democratic policies, but every major area where these crimes are prevalent are democratic left leaning policies that destroyed the economy, and inflated the housing price and consumer goods prices. Less jobs, more expensive housing and essentials will make any 1st world city a poverty hole. I don’t think for profit healthcare insurance is a good thing either, but I also don’t think it’s a good thing to force the working class to pay for everyone’s insurance either. We need a better way, and you’re right we need it quickly. The prison system in America in many instances here is also *for profit* which I believe is a huge issue. But once again, the people who commit the crimes are a **very predictable** group of members in the society. Namely the ones in cities where democracy has failed them.

I swear to god, I've been going on about this point for years. My wife must be getting tired of hearing me say it too. I just don't know what you can do to make this link outside of restructuring education. My big deal here is that we treat the world too simply, Elon Musk is solving the EV crisis, not a team of engineers. Jeff Bezo's invented Amazon, not teams of people working constantly to make sure it all works. It's everywhere, and it seems to create this idea that these problems are a lot easier than they are to solve. If you figure out how to work around that issue, please tell me I can't stress my agreement with you here enough.

&gt; So again you would say visiting conferences would help to get this understanding you are having?

I think you should start there and meet people, make some friends and keep up with their work (by seeing them at conferences often enough). They can tell you changes they are seeing, and the conferences will tell you changes everyone is seeing. But don't go to 100 conferences to start, pick a niche and start there. Maybe power transmission, energy transformation, or something like that until you have an idea of what's going on. 

Lignite is a nono, imo they should be using micro-grids to get basic energy going and then targeted investments to really ramp up energy. You just keep asking questions that are focused exactly on what I do, are you trying to Dox me with flattery? :P

So I specifically work in developing countries, and my current hurdle (topic?) is explaining why traditional investment is sub par and we need to rethink investment trends. This is hard for a bunch of reasons, but mostly because the big money is easiest to distribute to a few people, and those few people (big dev. firms and the like) are skilled at big jobs not a bunch of small ones. So you get a 100 MW hydro plant that requires a shit ton of infrastructure to connect everyone it services, and this makes sense because it's how the EU and US were connected and built so we know it works. But the discussion on materials to build out transmission gets glossed over, even though it's expensive compared to a bunch of solar panels and local grids which can be scaled up. 

And when you have a bunch of local grids the interconnected distribution lines are smaller, because the local -- you know what this is some electrical engineering stuff. Basically you need less copper the shorter distance you move power. So by moving the bulk of generation next to a community, you need less copper to move the energy around, and this is why I think the traditional model doesn't work as well for developing countries. Now my actions are to move expert opinion that direction, some good news is I know people at IEA that have been surprisingly sympathetic to the argument.

(Before that I worked for my dad's company part time, so I guess you could say he paid for all of it, lol). I did France and then Italy and then Greece next. I am an Ancap so I wanted to see anarchists in these places. Yes, I know they are different kinds of ""anarchists"" and not really full anarchists like us. I went to an anarchist book store in Italy and it had a lot of English books, but no Rothbard or Ancap. Like I said, I expected that, not a surprise. I went to Greece, which everyone knows is famous for its revolutionary anarchism, its economic crisis and everything going on right now. Here I found directions for a local anarchist center. I went and didn't see anybody, but it was covered in graffiti, mostly in Greek so I couldn't read it. Whatever, I started taking pictures. Then some people came out and confronted me. This should have been my first warning sign something was not right, because photography is not a crime. They were not violent, but they were not friendly, like asking who I was, what I wanted. They all spoke good English actually. Not uncommon in Greece. I said I was a tourist and an anarchist and I just wanted to take pictures. Then they got friendly and told me I should have asked first (but pictures are no NAP violation so I don't know why, but I didn't say anything) and they invited me inside. We hung out for a while and smoked hash (there is no good dank in Europe as you might find out like in Cali, everyone smokes hash with tobacco which isn't as cool as it sounds). We started talking about politics and anarchism. I was trying to talk about the state, they were like yeah no doubt the state was bad. But they wanted to talk about capitalism, capitalism this and that. This is when we started to get into a debate. I told them that what they called capitalism is different from the free market. They said capitalism is free markets. And I said I agreed. That is what I am saying. Real capitalism is free markets. And they said yes, that is what we are trying to get rid of. And I said no, but we don't even have that right now. We need more free markets. And everyone at the same time was like ""nooo"" we are anarchists, we are against capitalism. Anarchists oppose capitalism. And I said but not anarcho-capitalists. Anarcho-capitalists are the anarchists who support capitalism. I had a fanny pack (yeah, lame I know) for my camera and in that I had this yellow and black bowtie (also super lame, it was a joke but I wasnt wearing it). And I said look, these are the Ancap colors, yellow and black, like versus the communist red and black. Well, these guys had a lot of red and black in the building already so I thought they would get it. I think that is when it started to get a really bad vibe, really tense in the air. The free market thing was funny, we disagreed but I think they thought I was just confused. Everyone was uncomfortable now. Then someone said markets wont work with democracy. And I said exactly, that's it, democracy is against anarchism. And they kind of agreed, and said yes, we don't have real democracy, just governments, and we needed more democracy. I said no, we need less democracy, democracy is the enemy. And we need to end democracy to have anarchy. Then they were all like ""noooo"" again. You know that thing people do in groups when everyone all says ""nooo"" or expresses some disapproval at the same time. And one of them said ""but we do want to stop democracy"" and then they kind of spoke back and forth in Greek. I didn't really understand it. And they asked me what I meant. So I said okay, I had the floor, I was going to tell them about ancapism. And I tried to explain to them some Rothbard and Hoppe. I said the natural order in anarchy is that the best rise to the top, the market picks who is the best. They compete and are peaceful. They said what do we want instead of anarchy. I said we want private owners to own their own land and businesses, and to employ people. They said that is what we have now. I said no, it would be even better. One of the guys said it was like feudalism. And I said it is not feudalism. Eventually one of the guys spoke up and I thought he was Greek, but he spoke English perfectly so he may have not been. He said he knew what anarcho-capitalism was and that we were basically fascists. He asked me if I thought everything should be private. And I said yes. And he asked me if I thought people were unequal. And I told him yes. And that not everyone would have equal rights. I said everyone has the right to own property and not be done aggression against. But that not everyone had to be treated equally by the owners. He said what about immigrants and racism. And I said that would not happen in a free market, but yes property owners could be racist if they wanted to. They had to respect property. Then he called me a fascist again, and someone else said I was a fascist. And then they basically all started shouting fascist at me, and one of them grabbed me by the wrists. They pulled me out the door, it was up three floors, and basically drug me down the stairs on my back. It hurt really bad and I remember yelling ""you're breaking the NAP"" and things like that. ""Stop initiating force against me."" Then they kicked me around on the ground in the hallway, before they took my camera and threw me outside. I was crying and stuff, I just sat there. I was in shock because it was so sudden. Looking back there were warning signs though. I think they felt bad for me and gave the camera back, but when I looked later they stole the memory card with all of my Greek photos. So they initiated force and theft. They broke the NAP. I knew the left anarchists were not real anarchists, but I never knew they would do something that bad. I wasnt seriously hurt, just kicked around a little, lots of bruises and little cuts.

Mary Sue is thrown around as a term by people who have perhaps not realised why they dislike Rey but still like Luke, Anakin or any other action movie man. Rey is feminine, but still assertive against characters seen as males in positions of authority and this has lead to her being a ""bitch, brat, know it all, mary sue, insert your favourite gendered insult here"".

This argument is a really bad one, and it's frequently used by Disney and fans to discredit criticism about Rey and Rose as *characters* (not actors) because it has an inherent capability that makes it attractive for people who want to shut down a conversation: *it cannot be disproven*.

It's like pressing the big and red ""nuke"" button for an argument because there's nothing that can be done once the argument was made. You're not going to survive the nuclear war, so don't bother!

Seriously, think about this for a second. How could someone ever disprove something when the existence of said quality is *completely* on the person making the argument to determine? Everything someone would write as a response is immediately seen as a lie to save face, and every criticism is invalidated on the spot because someone who is sexist obviously cannot be trusted to rate a female character.

I always roll my eyes when this argument comes up as a ""weapon of mass destruction"", simply because *widespread sexism in Star Wars fandoms* is a made-up problem. And there's empirical evidence to suggest that.

There have been tons of female characters in the old EU. Jaina Solo Fel. Leia Organa became a Jedi Knight. Mara Jade Skywalker. Vesthara Khai. Asajj Ventress. Nomi Sunrider. Ahsoka Tano.

The list of even just force-sensitive female characters goes on and on. Some of them were protagonists in their book series and comics. Others were supporting characters at times. Some were antagonists. Leia Organa Solo for *most* of the old EU was in charge of the family, and she frequently told Han how foolish his ideas were.

And this might be old news, but barely a year before the release of TLJ, Jaina Solo won a fan vote *years* after she was made non-canon to be made into a black series action figure.

I'm not saying there are no idiots on the internet, but this ""criticism has to be taken with a grain of salt because she is a woman"" is just nonsense. Science Fiction had plenty of strong women and Star Wars had plenty of female force-sensitive characters who showed up Luke, Han and the others for three decades.",True,False,False,,,0,1575221273,,1575225070,0,{},f9car83,False,t3_e3vfav,False,True,t1_f999sbh,/r/StarWars/comments/e3vfav/the_mandalorian_achieves_tension_and_emotional/f9car83/,False,,1584243170,3,True,False,StarWars,t5_2qi4s,r/StarWars,public,0,

Then I can go on talking about my experiences possibly resulting in folks buying more Onas resulting in them then sending me more. The circle of fap!

Sadly durability is a concern with Onas, even with pricey models like the ZXY. I have to assure you this is not due to poor build quality but because of the nature of the material. Remember it's at least twice as soft as FL material. Which results in a more natural and luxurious experience but the trade off is material that's more delicate and liable to break down quicker.

Now 30 uses is a bit ridiculous for a Ona like the ZXY. Whoever told you that either doesn't have an Ona from that price range or turns into a caveman during play. You'd have to treat your ZXY pretty badly to only get 30 uses out of it. Or you got a defective toy. With reasonable use and care you're looking at between 1-4 years with Onas like the ZXY. FLs are between 5-10. So there is definitely a notable difference in durability no doubt. 

Whether this is worth it is totally down to the individual user. I can tell you that for me it's already paid for itself after only 7 uses. Honestly, I got my money's worth after the first go. I'm not saying this to over hype you, I'd never wanna do that so keep your expectations in check okay buddy. The toy just really appeals to me and my tastes. To me nothing beats pussy so if it's not available the closer I can get to that dreamy feeling the better. The ZXY absolutely nails that, hence my adoration for it. If you prefer more crazy, exciting and alien experiences like the intenser FL sleeves it might not jazz you as much.

Both FamilyTreeDNA (a DNA testing company) and GEDmatch (a 3rd party, public genealogy website where people can voluntarily upload their own results that they get from DNA test companies) have, in the past, allowed law enforcement to search its database without their users' knowledge/consent. After user backlash, they added an opt-in to their privacy settings allowing users to be invisible to police searches, but personally, I would still avoid them.

23andMe has a policy of legally challenging all law enforcement requests for information they receive, and to date have never yielded any information to such requests ([transparency report](https://www.23andme.com/transparency-report/)). Their [privacy policy](https://www.23andme.com/privacy/) states that they will never share information with insurance companies or employers. Additionally, in the US, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) makes it illegal for health insurance to base coverage on genetic information (although it doesn't extend to life/disability insurance). Participation in research is voluntary (opt in), and they won't share individual data without consent. Any non-individual data they do share with research partners (for researching treatments to genetic diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's) is anonymized and aggregated such that an individual's data can't be discerned. Since they operate in Europe, they are GDPR-compliant (General Data Protection Regulation), and because they're based in California, will soon have to be CCPA-compliant (California Consumer Privacy Act) starting next year.

AncestryDNA has a similar [privacy policy](https://www.ancestry.com/cs/privacyphilosophy) to 23andMe. They *have* yielded data to some [law enforcement requests](https://www.ancestry.com/cs/transparency), but only non-genetic data in relation to things like credit card theft - never for genetic information.

So, it depends largely on the company and how much you're willing trust it. Companies could change their policies, but not without the risk of significant damage to their reputation and business, given that people are rightfully very sensitive to the privacy of their genetic information.

I don't need figures on the EU budget; I'm fully aware we're a major contributor. Your claim is about some maligned perception emanating from Europe. There is nothing to back this up. This is emotionally charged nonsense born out of nothing but insecurity. 

Pre-referendum major EU nations thought very highly of us, and even 18 months afterwards despite taking a reputational hit we still scored well: [https://www.britishcouncil.org/sites/default/files/from\_the\_outside\_in.pdf](https://www.britishcouncil.org/sites/default/files/from_the_outside_in.pdf) 

If anything the referendum gave more cause for people to think ill of us.

&gt; I never said it was, people voted leave [for their own reasons](https://lordashcroftpolls.com/2016/06/how-the-united-kingdom-voted-and-why/). What I’m saying is that if we don’t want to play by the rules of the club, it stands to reason that we should leave the club. Our special exemptions can only breed resentment from those members which don’t benefit from them. 

Exactly. So then we are in agreement that, as you say ""*We are a thorn in the side of the project and we are holding up the federalisation of Europe""* has fuck all to do with anything or the status we enjoy within the EU. This is not a reason to leave it if all parties are happy with current arrangements. If the EU was unhappy with it there would be a concerted effort to curb those powers (which we fought for, and won under Thatcher) under threat of ejection. The fact is there wasn't because the deal, despite maybe the grumblings of some ardent super-Federalists, worked for both parties.

&gt;The problem is what was a trading bloc is now a supranational political entity run for the benefit of powerful old men in suits. Most leavers have no axe to grind with regards to harmonisation of trade and regulations and can see the good that it brings. Where it needs to stop short is it being a political body which makes no bones about its federalist aims. 

Spare me. We've already been through the fact that we had the opt-outs from the political integration. Nothing was going to happen here unless our Government passed it into law.

It's all very easy to point the finger at a singular cause to make sense of the complex problems that have arisen with the advent of globalism. If you want to point a finger do so at successive British governments who have failed to mitigate the consequences of entire industries on which towns like Hull and Sunderland were dependent going bust due to international competition. That is not the EU's fault. And I'll tell you something else, it's going to be a hell of a lot worse when the UK is utterly exposed to cheaper American and Chinese firms without the protections trading blocs like the EU afford some of our industries.

&gt;I wish no ill on anyone, however I cannot see how the EU can make people’s lives better by more interventionism. I’d be keen to get the opinion of the Greeks after the tyranny they have experienced at the hands of the EU following their economic issues.

You mean 70+ years of unprecedented peace and prosperity on the continent? Gee, I wonder how my life has been bettered by that? But yeah, you ""hope for its peaceful demise"".

But let's talk about Greece by all means, a country which cooked its books and spent YEARS misreporting economic statistics, running a deficit which was against the EU's 3% deficit rule, and then cost the EU taxpayer billions in no less than three separate bailouts. Again, Greek corruption was its undoing and while I have every sympathy in the world for ordinary Greeks, how you can blame the EU for their situation escapes me here.

&gt;The real issue I have with the EU is that it can only succeed by homogenising it’s member nations and their cultures, the nuances of which are precisely what makes Europe the great place it is to live.

brianmayforreal Wouldn't it be a dream if this man -

this hero - this immigrant - the Polish man - was the

one who finally reunited Britain ? Maybe he is the

signal that it's time to kick out Xenophobia,

Isiolationism, BREXIT, and all the lies that have

dominated our media for the last three years ? Isn't it

time to remember that we, Britain, are a nation of

foreigners ?!! That is our strength - and our pride.

Anyone see the film 'Bohemian Rhapsody' ? Se what a

poor immigrant can do for us all ? It's time, folks.

When you vote, remember that neither of the major

parties offers you the Peace and Stability of a strong

Britain allied to the most powerful alliance in the

world - Europe. Bri -- with acknowledgments to the

First source argues that migrants are a net benefit, second expands but also argues that the benefit or detriment of migrants is not very large at all, about 1%.

Even logically thinking about it, EU migrants (the largest number in the last 20 years) are generally working age, most EU nationals I know are under 45 and I've very rarely seen older Poles etc. This makes them younger on average than the British population as a whole. Also I'd imagine that they use European health insurance, so it's not like they're bleeding the NHS dry if they use it (which because they're younger, they don't as much).

We can very roughly trace the history of the speech balloon in modern comics through the European use of speech scrolls, so called because artists would put paper scrolls in paintings and paint words on them. You've likely seen these before, since they were very common in religious and historical iconography until roughly the renaissance, when realism started to become emphasised. Even after that, they remained popular in other use for another century or two.

Eventually, they started appearing in political imagery. Both of the two most important cartoonists in that era, to whom we owe a lot in modern cartoons, occasionally used speech bubbles: William Hogarth, who pioneered early political cartoons and sequential narrative in modern art, was using them as early as the 1720s; and James Gillray, who established the political cartoon as a genre later in the 18th century employed them on and off.

Meanwhile, the speech scroll evolved into the banderole on both sides of the Atlantic, also frequently for political purposes. They were very common in propaganda pieces from the time, and by the time that Gillray used them, they already worked much in the same way that they do today. There's a very famous example from the Napoleonic Wars, when Jefferson imposed an embargo on virtually all non-US ships. You can find that at the bottom of this page, which also has a great example directly above it on how speech bubbles were used in the same manner as nowadays: https://columbia1893.weebly.com/jefferson-political-cartoons.html (Note: I know nothing of the page itself, just thought the collection of images nicely displays the topic.)

Finally, we can arrive at modern comics. In this case, it was mostly popularised by early modern American comics, which featured them extensively. _The Katzenjammer Kids_ (Dirks) and _The Yellow Kid_ (Outcault) are usually considered the first modern newspaper comic strips, and they both featured extensive use of speech bubbles, which the Americans then called ""word balloons"". _The Little Bears_ (Swinnerton), _Happy Hooligan_ (Opper), and _Little Nemo_ (McCay) are other examples of popular strips in the 1890s and 1900s that made frequent use of speech bubbles. Almost all famous American comics after that used them - with a few notable exceptions such as Val Foster's _Prince Valiant_.

Europe was slower to catch on, with some exceptions. Alain Saint-Ogan, who makes a strong claim to the title of the pioneer of modern French comics, did use them a lot, as did Hergé - arguably the most famous comic artist in Europe ever. Both used them as early as in the 1920s, but they didn't become the norm until after World War II, when American comics started to become popular in Europe.",True,False,False,,,0,1575232349,,False,0,{},f9dcym0,False,t3_e4k997,False,False,t3_e4k997,/r/AskHistorians/comments/e4k997/who_invented_the_speech_bubble/f9dcym0/,False,,1584261760,7,True,False,AskHistorians,t5_2ssp3,r/AskHistorians,public,0,

There are records of the phrase being used all the way back to the 1200s but I understand that the reason it became so popular was when it was used in the time of the French Revolution to describe how the revolutionaries felt so upset that the great democratic(ish) state of Europe to their north was unwilling to publicly support them when they decided to go around executing tens of thousands of nobles and starting wars with all of the countries on their borders - the revolutionaries were apparently incensed that the UK chose to join the coalitions against them instead.

In general, though, these days it's just used as a standard phrase to describe how the French (and the Scottish) for centuries viewed England as a snivelling, wretched country which was forever taking the opposite side in the wars they fought. It's kind of more of a joke these days than anything, but it still underlines the kind of subconscious reasons why French and English people just kind of naturally don't like each other as much as they probably should - there's this base reluctance on both country's parts to refuse to let go of the past and to continue to hold old grudges against each other.

I think the right word here is ''allowed''. If something in, for example, America is legal, that means the following: the Congress and the Senate have passed the bill, which the public was informed about. The President has signed it, all the federal agencies were notified about it, and the courts, over the years, have established precedent on how that law is actually to be applied. 

On the other hand, Holocaust was planned in backroom meetings, hushed words and euphemisms left to bureaucrats to infer from vaguely worded orders. It was executed in the places no one has ever heard of, villages in the middle of nowhere.

This is, IMO, similar in nature to the chief of police of a corrupt town in a corrupt country being corrupt himself. Sure, everyone knows he's taking bribes, and  he'll probably never be prosecuted and will die in his bed rich, but that will never make the act of taking bribes legal. 

And I'll go off-topic now, but it's actually one of the great tragedies of WW2 which is rarely talked about, mostly because people don't give a shit about Germans in that context. But think about it: it was the final surrender before the tide of fascist barbarity. Stalin killed millions too, but he at least gave them trials. Bogus trials, but still a trial of some sort.

[],,SalubriousStreets,1318513774.0,,,[],,1∆,dark,text,t2_61a6d,False,False,[],"Hey! This is something I'm actually studying in my MA program and would be glad to share some of my thoughts on why you might feel that way!

The UN has three major challenges that create this perception. The first is branding, the second is understanding of the system, and the third is compliance.

1. Branding: UNICEF, Red Cross, UNDP, UNHDR, ECOSOC, and more! These are all UN programs or institutions that do lots of work like bringing aid to impoverished or in-need communities, providing assistance during disasters, fundraising for new projects, and most importantly *remaining neutral*. These programs publish their statistics, what goals they met, and what goals they need to meet very often, but they all have some big problems. No one knows they're part of the UN, because of the consistency and dryness of reporting they're not picked up by the media very often, and they do not publicize their success. For example, the Red Cross conducts aid missions all over the world, but you don't see many headlines saying ""Red Cross, a Committee Within the UN, Saved X People This Year"". Part of this is on purpose though! More media attention leads to more pressure and more expectations. Expectations which aren't met may lead to angry people who advocate their government to withdraw support for the UN. Furthermore, the UN's main clients are states, they don't generally care what we think of them because we aren't funding them, states are. So the UN is dry, dull, and broken up into tiny organs that do lots of stuff that you don't read about in the news, but that's kind of by design.
2. Understanding the System: The UN's system for creating laws and enforcing them is *really* complicated and not a lot of people understand how it works very well. Generally the international system works on something called **customary law** which is slow, but fairly effective (in my opinion). Here's an ELI5 of customary law: Every day you go to the same diner for breakfast and get the same food. Eventually the people at the counter have your breakfast ready for you when you walk in, you pay and leave. One day you walk in and don't want to have the same thing, but it's too late they already made it! You get angry at them, but they say, hey if you had a problem with us making your breakfast before you came in you should have said something! By not speaking against it you consented to this norm. Customary law is the same thing! States at the GA get up and say stuff like ""we think it's bad that drone strikes are happening without the consent of the state being bombed"". They say it over and over again until a norm is established, once that norm is established it crystallizes into customary law and becomes international law. Now when state Y wants to bomb state X with drones, but hasn't asked for consent. Guess what? They can't without the ICJ and Security Council getting involved now. If state Y complains the UN can point to the customary law and say: hey you didn't express your dissent, that means you consented to this happening. This makes it so laws form over time with consensus and states can't just pick and choose what their positions are. Overall, it's meant to be flexible, and it is! So the UN has a great deal of power in the creation of the world we live in through customary laws and norms like this!
3. Lastly, compliance is a serious problem which hurts the UN's efficacy. Speaking bluntly, the USA, Russia, and China simply do not comply with international laws when it doesn't suit them. This is because they are part of the P5 on the Security Council and don't have to. However, this is an issue that has been really exacerbated in recent years as Bush refused to justify NATO's invasion of Afghanistan, Russia refuses to acknowledge anything going on in Ukraine, and China consistently cuts it close in the South China Sea and conducts, what looks to be, a hidden genocide. I would say the biggest problem with this is not the UN though, it's the USA. The UN doesn't work if states disregard it's power and the US under Bush really just threw their dick on the table and said ""fuck justifications we can do what we want and if you ask questions then we'll just leave the UN or veto you in the Security Council"". This really damaged the UN system because other powerful member states can now say ""hey the US doesn't let anyone investigate human rights or Geneva violations in Iraq or Afghanistan, so why should we let you investigate our ""counter-terrorism"" methods in Xinjiang?"" So in short, the UN can't prevent states damaging it.

Ultimately, the UN is a system that relies on cooperation. So when we say the UN isn't working, we're often looking at the wrong things or the wrong people!

Edit because I remembered some other important stuff that I forgot to mention!

The UN is also one of the biggest depositories for treaties! So if two nations want to make peace, make a trade deal, or a defense pact, they can use the UN as a depository for their treaty. Why does that matter? Well if one party isn't holding up their end of the treaty then you can use the ICJ to try to push them to comply or punish them for not complying.

Also! Why is the UN so bad at actually getting anything in the realm of human rights accomplished? All you have to do is look at the news for this one. Trump recently pardoned a bunch of war criminals, so what does that mean for the UN? Well, now if the UN goes to China or Russia and says ""hey, about those extra judicial killings and persecution of Muslims..."" they can turn around and say ""well the US just pardoned a bunch of war criminals so if they're not complying we're not complying"". Also, look at the abuses of human rights from another perspective. The HRC is a super European institution founded by white European people. Why is that important? Asian, African, or Eurasians can turn around and tell the HRC ""listen you made all these rules without asking for ANY of our advice, how is this not just neo-colonialism?""

I agree. I don't think Asia will enjoy their immense rise though, but that's a different topic.

&gt;Some Regions in USA have as low birth rates as southern or Eastern Europe.

Yes but the USA is a united country so with a fiscal union whereas the EU isn't. So it doesn't matter. The US is having positive population growth. Certain European countries are not. And besides - Europe as a whole continent (not just individual countries) is projected to undergo demographic decline. The UK and France will escape that, but one will no longer be a member of the EU and will be almost totally aligned with the US in the future. Europe is demographically doomed and nothing will change that. The US' population will keep growing. That will bring social and ethnic friction, but the US will cope.

&gt;Who is second is also really important since EU and China if allied could already pressure America immensely...

Extremely unlikely - the EU is already unhappy with what China is doing to muslims over there/China's protectionism policies. Not to mention China's soft power has basically gone down the toilet in the last year or so. They will never ally with China. They may attempt to consolidate independence but ally?

Sounds kinda rude to say it like that, I know, but many kids become familiar with the historical nuances *after* it becoming normalised to them as a slang word which they're not going to stop using. A lot of young Europeans were introduced to the word by rap music and Tarantino movies, not racists, so obviously, in their minds, it's just not a racist word. So as long as we have this strange duality we're going to have incidents like this, like the Gwyneth Paltrow incident, like the PDP bridge, etc. where people who are totally not racist will forget themselves and use it as slang or quote a movie or something. Which becomes a whole incident because some people will then take it as racist. And yes, the exact same thing *will* happen if ""reclaimed"" gay slurs ever become as popular in modern media as the n-word has.

My point wasn't to complain that some people aren't ""allowed"" to say it, but rather to point out that as long as this duality exists and the slang use is as popular in modern media as it has been these past few decades, we're going to keep having controversial incidents and they will mostly concern innocent non-racist people.

so firstly you are pulling every right wing voter into the same box acting like they all think the same way when thats clearly false

in a two party state like the usa everyone votes for the party that represents their wishes the best and thinking the republicans are superior to the democrats in fulfilling their wishes does not mean they align 100% with it

moving on now

the best way to think about political alignment is to have left and right economic thought and authoritarian and libertarian approaches to society

id say the usa can move between center right and center left depending on if the president is a d or an r but it has fairly consistently been more libertarian than say the uk owing to 1a and 2a which the uk lacks

id also say the overton window in the uk is to the left of the usa which is demonstrated by say the presence of universal free healthcare and the widespread support of it

continuing

not gonna address all the scandals that are all over the place its not really important

u may be right about the statistics but not for the reasons you think

i actually used to be super left wing until i finished high school and never even considered conservative thought until later exposure to it the reason for this being that conservative thought is noticeably absent from our schools and universities as a whole

so it makes sense that older people who are always less educated than the new crop were raised in a time where conservative thought was fairly standard and lefty ideas were pretty unheard of

i suspect that this pattern will reverse kind of like a sine wave back to the left wing being fringe in our educational institutions

you are not the big brain contrarian you think you are bro and the fact that trump is popular even after all the shit hes done goes to show how much of a wreck a lot of the new left is since it means that you guys are worse than him

also brexit was voted on already the question wasnt ""should we stay in the eu or strike a deal then leave"" it was ""should we stay yes or no"" it doesnt matter what the deal is it has to happen regardless which is why any party that says ""ight lads lets actually leave the way we promised to leave back in 2016"" with or without a deal gets a lot of support

1560- Scottish reformation

1567 - Mary, Queen of Scotts, is imprisoned and abdicates, handing rule to her one year old son, through a series of court/church appointed regents. 

1583 - James is allowed to rule on his own. 

1589 - Anne of Denmark marries James. 

1603 - Queen Elizabeth I of England dies so James VI of Scotland also now becomes James I of England and Ireland (under English rule at this time). He moves to London

1605 - The gunpowder plot, where some Catholics try to blow up James’ parliament in London. We still celebrate it today, with fireworks and effigy burning. Really. 

1611 - King James Bible published. 

1625 - James dies and his youngest son, Charles I takes over as King. 

1638 - the National Covenant is signed in Edinburgh

1644-5- Civil war in Scotland

1649 - Charles I executed. Cromwell rules England

1650 - Charles II signs the Covenant, Cromwell invades. 

1652 - Scotland ruled by England

1658 - Cromwell dies

1660 - Charles II restored to throne. Scotland has independent rule again. 


The reformation

This is a general term for the mass conversion in Europe from Catholicism to the new, Protestant, religion in the 1500s. In general, the reformation was a switch from the Catholic tradition of a hierarchical structure, (with God speaking to the Pope, who spoke to the Cardinals and so on down the line until a priest spoke to you) to a Presbyterian system where every individual speaks directly to God, with a minister to help the congregation interpret His wishes and a group of elders governing things.  During the reign of Mary, Queen of Scots (James’ mother), things really sped up in Scotland. Although she was Catholic, the church in Scotland officially became the Kirk in 1560 and adopted a Calvinist approach to Presbyterianism under the influence of John Knox. James VI himself was brought up as Protestant, but not a Calvinist. There are, of course plenty of Catholics still practicing, just not many in positions of power.  You can imagine the atmosphere with so much religious change and zealotry around.


Calvinism

This is the spectacularly dismal strain of Christianity that came to Scotland with Knox and is still a huge part of our collective unconscious now. Basically, there are two tenants that make it unique. First, frivolity is sin, so no saints, gilding, music, etc in church or anywhere really. Second, you are probably going to hell. There are a small percentage who aren’t definitely damned from birth but nobody knows who they are and if they commit a sin, they’re off to hell too. Fun. Also, Knox and his cronies were famously misogynistic, even for their time. 


James VI/I

The podcast taught me a lot about this dude. So apart from the funky new knowledge that he’s the only European king to have written a book on demonology (and that he LOVED a good witch burning), he’s best known for having been the son of MQS (who was imprisoned when her child was very young, having probably blown up his father), having the Bible translated into English so that it was accessible to the masses, and uniting the crowns of Britain, athough the parliaments remained separate until well after his death. He also started colonising Ireland and the Americas and had a reputation for avoiding unnecessary wars so, all in all, a pretty influential guy who was generally thought of well. Anything described as “Jacobean” in history is from his era. As is the entire podcast. 


The Covenant

This is really just the reformation but in a particularly Scottish way. It started as a secret group of influential Protestants vowing to live as Presbyterians and resist the Catholic Church. They were successful and it culminated in a covenant (written promise) between Scotland and God (I don’t know how God signed it) rejecting the introduction of Church of England practices and establishing a clear division of church and state. This put the church at odds with the King (Charles I, who believed in his divine rights) and started a civil war. Something similar was happening in England at the time, with puritans, lead by Cromwell, eventually winning the English civil war and executing Charles. 


The civil war

I literally can’t even get my head around who was on what side when! Apart from anything else, Scotland, Ireland and England were all having independent civil wars and sending troops to each other on various sides. What happened in each country influenced the others. I think the main points in Scotland are that the Covenanters fought the Royalists but they all wanted a king, just not one who ruled the church. Charles I really missed this point and after Scotland rejected him, so did England (just in a more head chopping way). So Scotland didn’t like the new (Commonwealth) parliament in England either and immediately tried to restore Charles. Even while his head was still attached, this didn’t work, so they crowned his son, Charles II. This really pissed off Cromwell, who invaded Scotland and, although the country united against him, easily decimated our armies and occupied the land. It wasn’t until Charles II was restored in England that Scotland got its independence back.",True,False,False,,,0,1575253789,,1575287704,1,{'gid_2': 1},f9ex2ax,True,t3_e4iq7m,False,True,t3_e4iq7m,/r/WitchesVsPatriarchy/comments/e4iq7m/i_found_this_fascinating_podcast_literally_about/f9ex2ax/,False,,1584289655,2,True,False,WitchesVsPatriarchy,t5_p3r73,r/WitchesVsPatriarchy,public,1,

Culture is more then just the aesthetic taste and holdiays of a people. Its also ways of thinking and attitudes towards other people. While we can certainly have a myriad of cultural practices (buddihst holidays, slavic food, fuck it, indonesian architectural taste. It doesn't matter) but these cultural practices are signifiers of differences, like a flag or a border, which is something that we should seek to avoid, to prevent the many issues within the US. 

Cascadia should seek to create its own monoculture. A large portion of the issues with the US is the large cultural divisions, that leads to a divide and rule policy among the ruling elite. Its a lot easier to get people to forget about the environment or economic inequality when they can just point at the ""others"" and blame them. The solution to this is to make the nation racially colorblind (and eventually we'll become some shade of brown anyways) and create a single cascadian culture, out of the myriad cultures we have right now. Welcoming to foreigners, but the expectation is that they should seek to become Cascadian as much as possible, contributing to it but not being separate.

It's largely forgotten now but there was almost a Civil War in France in May 1958 after right-wing paratroopers took control of Corsica and invaded mainland France. They actually brought DeGaulle to power in a putsch because they believed he would support their cause but in actuality De Gaulle despised the pied noirs (European-Algerians) because they backed Pétain instead of him during WWII. De Gaulle also came to the conclusion that keeping Algeria in France would turn France into a muslim majority country due to a combination of high Arab birth-rates and the free mobility they'd inevitably enjoy as French citizens. 

One reason the Algerian war was so bloody and complicated was because Algeria had been defined as part of France in the 1848 constitution. The colonial rulers of Algeria had worked around that by denying the natives the right to vote, for instance, there was a law that held up until the 1930s that said natives couldn't vote unless they converted to Christianity. Since Algerian society was extraordinarily rural and heavily religious few natives converted on behalf of the people who waged brutal insurgencies against them in the 19th century and displaced them from many of the best lands. Still, there had been no past conception of any country or nation-state like what would come to be known as Algeria -- for better or worse, most Algerians considered themselves to be loyal subjects of the French Empire. Most of the men who would go onto found the FLN were French-Algerian soldiers who had fought for De Gaulle in WWII, in the beginning, they were actually quite moderate. They agreed to essentially leave the whites alone as long as they got independence but this didn't really please either the white population or the French establishment and things gradually escalated on both sides. The OAS (fascist pied noir group) initially tried simply to maintain French colonial control but then began branching out into the possibility of seceding from France and setting up either an Apartheid-style state or potentially seceding from an independent Algeria -- it was too late in the game to try either, but there are allegations that the CIA and Israel helped them in their attempt.  The OAS left a lasting impression on the French right with Algerian War veteran and OAS-sympathizer Jean Le-Pen going on to form the National Front (main French far-right party); it also left an impression on the Left, though not all positive, by popularizing the post-colonial discourse, in particular the works of FLN-aligned activist Frantz Fanon. 

The French-Algerian War is actually something of a misnomer because it was really a miniature French Civil War. It brought down four governments, it led to the police slaughter of 300 Algerian independence demonstrators in Paris, and it ended with a nation that had previously been considered (officially, at-least) part of the French homeland seceding with most of its white population fleeing or being expelled. Most of the muslim Algerians who fought for France either fled to France or were slaughtered/tortured by the FLN too. The civilians of native Algeria suffered the most but in the end Algeria descended into an unviable nationalist dictatorship, which descended into an equally bloody civil war against home-grown Jihadists in the 90s. The French establishment maintained a close relationship with independent Algeria and permitted Algerian immigration into France to fill alleged gaps in its labor market. It's one of those situations where an enormous amount of blood was spilled and in the end it's not clear whether it was all worth it. It seemed that the tide of history was on Algeria's side as it played the role of progressive third world nationalist state that helped third world nations protest Western economic exploitation -- but it all fell apart in the 80s.",True,False,False,,,0,1575255373,,False,0,{},f9ez6z5,False,t3_e4lf2b,False,False,t1_f9euh9z,/r/stupidpol/comments/e4lf2b/every_time_i_hear_someone_say_our_country_is_more/f9ez6z5/,False,,1584290916,7,True,False,stupidpol,t5_hitz3,r/stupidpol,public,0,

About the country, I actually move occasionally around Europe (west and east) but at the moment the packages will be getting to Israel, so the shipping is even more expensive than it is to western Europe (UK).

&amp;#x200B;

The performance boost- ah, well, honestly there are two criteria: 1) the objective performance which is kinda... bearable... atm with the Phenom(\\Athlon). At least it could be said that the pain of spending money is greater than the joy of a smoother experience:).  2) the subjective performance where it is a question of a bang for a buck. I'm sinking a certain amount of bucks anyway so this is the baseline, if instead of getting me back 1\\1 in 1$\\computing power, my already spent dollar could suddenly gain value of 1\\2 or 1\\3- I'm prepared to add more money to the ante (not 1K$ though, there is a limit even for \*my\* thriftiness) and the joy from a smoother experience+greater efficiency will trump the pain of parting with said dollar.

 Em um documento de duas páginas, a empresa Promocom Eventos e Publicidade cobrava-lhe uma indenização por nove shows que o músico, ao morrer em março de 2013, não pôde fazer.   
 “Faleceu sem atender à totalidade das obrigações assumidas”, afirmava o texto, ressaltando que “notoriamente, tais obrigações não poderão [mais] ser atendidas”.

  

 Diante do silêncio de Alexandre, a notificação se transformou em uma ação de cobrança que ainda hoje tramita na Justiça paulista. A empresa, sediada no Paraná, exige R$ 225 mil de indenização, além de uma multa de R$ 100 mil por descumprimento de contrato (valores nominais, sem correção da inflação).

  “Com a [morte do Chorão](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2014/03/1421604-primeiro-ano-da-morte-de-chorao-e-lembrado-em-homenagens-e-novo-clipe.shtml), o capital investido deixou de fazer o lucro esperado”, afirma o advogado Rodrigo Ramina de Lucca, que representa a empresa e reclama também a restituição de outros R$ 225 mil que teriam sido pagos ao músico a título de adiantamento.

 De acordo com o advogado, o contrato com a banda previa a realização de 12 shows do Charlie Brown Jr., mas apenas três foram executados.

 “Ao investir consideravelmente na contratação da banda, a empresa deixou de contratar outro artista, o qual poderia ter-lhe proporcionado a receita inerente à sua atividade”, argumentou no processo.

 Reginaldo Ferreira Lima, advogado e avô materno de Alexandre Ferreira, diz que o pedido de indenização é uma “loucura”. “Naturalmente, [o Chorão não tinha como fazer](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2013/03/1241892-carismatico-e-explosivo-chorao-amealhou-fas-e-se-envolveu-em-polemicas.shtml) os shows, ele morreu...”.

 Em petição apresentada à Justiça, o advogado sustenta que uma indenização deve decorrer de um dano causado por ato ilícito e voluntário. “É óbvio que não há como imputar qualquer ato ilícito a ele.”

 [Alexandre Magno Abrão, o Chorão, tinha 42 anos](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2013/03/1242013-analise-com-esperteza-e-prepotencia-juvenis-chorao-foi-espelho-para-fas.shtml) quando foi encontrado morto em seu apartamento, em Pinheiros, na cidade de São Paulo.

 Exames detectaram que a morte do cantor ocorreu em [decorrência de uma overdose de cocaína](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2013/04/1257501-laudo-da-policia-aponta-que-cantor-chorao-morreu-por-overdose.shtml), como a acusação fez questão de salientar em um dos documentos anexados ao processo.

 O laudo necroscópico do IML (Instituto Médico Legal) afirma que f[oram encontradas no corpo do músico 4,714 microgramas de cocaína](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2013/03/1242607-tentei-trazer-ele-de-volta-diz-ex-de-chorao-sobre-vicio-em-cocaina.shtml) por mililitro de sangue.

 Skatista profissional na categoria freestyle nos anos 1980, Chorão fundou o Charlie Brown Jr. em 1992, tendo ao longo da carreira lançado nove discos de estúdio, dois álbuns ao vivo e mais duas coletâneas.

 O nome da banda, como o próprio relatou em entrevistas, foi escolhido depois que ele atropelou uma barraca de coco em Santos, aonde morou em boa parte da vida, na qual havia um desenho do personagem criado pelo cartunista Charles Schulz.

 O “Jr” foi acrescentado como uma homenagem a uma geração formada por grupos de rock, como Planet Hemp e Suicidal Tendencies, [entre outros, da qual dizia ser filho](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2013/03/1241933-amigos-de-santos-lembram-trajetoria-de-chorao.shtml).

 Seu último show ocorreu em Camboriú (SC), em 26 de janeiro de 2013, de acordo com o livro de fotografias “Eu Estava Lá Também” (editora Realejo), um projeto do próprio [Chorão que foi retomado pelo filho](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2013/03/1246101-familiares-de-chorao-organizam-duas-missas-de-setimo-dia-para-o-cantor.shtml).

 “Lembro que a primeira foto que fiz ficou fora de foco e eu pedi para ele voltar para perto da galera, e fiz outra”, contou Alexandre, à época do lançamento, em 2017.

 No processo aberto pela Promocom Eventos, o único [herdeiro ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2015/03/1602073-familiares-criticam-peca-sobre-charlie-brown-jr.shtml)de Chorão, hoje com 29 anos, questiona não apenas o pedido de indenização e da multa, mas a própria necessidade de ressarcimento pelos valores supostamente adiantados ao vocalista.

 Xande, como é conhecido, coloca em dúvida a autenticidade do contrato, datado de 23 de outubro de 2012, que previa exclusividade para a empresa na realização ou na vendas de shows da banda ao longo de 2013 no Paraná e nas cidades de Florianópolis, Joinville e Balneário Camboriú (SC), aquela da última apresentação do grupo.

 “Não tem qualquer semelhança com a assinatura real do falecido”, diz em documento encaminhado à Justiça, no qual declara ainda não haver prova de que o pagamento alegado foi realizado, de fato.

 A Promocom Eventos afirma que a acusação de falsidade contratual é despropositada e foi feita pelo filho do líder da banda apenas para que pudesse ganhar tempo.

 “Todos os pagamentos foram documentalmente provados”, diz o advogado da empresa, que anexou ao processo uma declaração da empresária Samantha Pereira de Jesus afirmando que intermediou o contrato com Chorão e que os adiantamentos ao vocalista foram pagos, sim.

 O juiz Cláudio Teixeira Villa, da 2ª Vara Civil de Santos, deu ganho de causa à empresa, ordenando ao espólio do músico o pagamento de R$ 325 mil, considerando a restituição dos valores e a multa.

 Não concordou, contudo, com a indenização. “Do contrário, haveria enriquecimento sem causa da parte autora, que, mesmo sem remunerar o artista, receberia pelo lucro de futura e eventual venda”, afirmou o magistrado.

 A decisão, no entanto, foi anulada pelo Tribunal de Justiça, que considerou que a Promocom não conseguiu demonstrar ter feito o adiantamento ao vocalista.

 “Há de se convir que a empresa não trouxe qualquer recibo de pagamento, comprovando haver repassado os valores cobrados nesta ação ao artista”, afirmou o relator do processo, Cláudio Hamilton.

 Por determinação dos desembargadores, um laudo pericial será realizado para apurar se a letra no contrato é realmente a do vocalista. A assinatura será comparada com a de seu passaporte.

[],,natermer,1331500384.0,,green,[],,Awesome Poster,dark,text,t2_759z0,False,False,[],"The only thing 'race realists' have in their corner on IQ is that it's been proven, through twin studies, that it's a inheritable trait.   It's not really something you have a conscious control over and who raises you and the environment you are raised doesn't have a significant impact, although they only compare relatively wealthy situations in developed nations.

All traits are a mixture of inheritable and environment.

For example two traits are 'Weight' and 'Height'.

Your body chemistry and environment and behavior control your weight. It's something you can consciously control and change through behavior.  Yeah if your parents are fat you will have a tendency to be fat, but that's not a super strong tendency. It's something you can control. Some people have a easier time at not being fat then other people.

Your height, on the other hand, isn't something you can control.  You can change your diet, or exercise, and do things to help to maintain height through your adult life (you tend to get shorter as you get older), but by and large if your parents were short then chances are you are going to be short and there isn't a whole lot you can do about it.

And as it turns out the IQ is much more like height then weight.

&amp;#x200B;

But like height it's not something that is completely independent from all other factors.  If you grew up with a shitty diet and had disease and other things then chances are your growth is going to get stunted. You might have the genes to grow tall, but it doesn't mean you actually grow tall.   IQ works the same way.

&amp;#x200B;

And then there is epigenetics to consider.

[https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/obesity-epigenetics-and-gene-regulation-927/](https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/obesity-epigenetics-and-gene-regulation-927/)

&amp;#x200B;

So nobody really has a strong definition or understanding what contributes to high intelligence in human beings.  It's not traced to any sort of genetic code.  There is no 'high IQ' gene that anybody has ever identified. So while it may be that IQ is tied to DNA the only scientific evidence for it is twin studies.

However nowadays scientists have realized that pure DNA sequencing is not the only mechanism in which traits are inheritable.

&amp;#x200B;

For example you have athletics.

Most top tier athletes have genetics that allow them to have their performance. It doesn't matter how young you are, it doesn't matter how dedicated you are, it doesn't matter what training you do, or who you train under, or how you eat or anything like that...  because they have the same level of dedication plus have better genetics.  You just can't match them.  You just didn't win the genetic lotto.

However they know that athletic ability is something that is developed over multiple generations.  If you have grand parents that were very athletic and trained and competed... and then your parents were very athletic and trained and competed...   Then you will likely have the traits to be very athletic...  not just AS athletic, mind you.  You can have the genetic potential to be MORE athletic.  Be faster, stronger, better swimmers then they had the potential to ever be.

So over the generations people who were fast tend to have FASTER offspring.

The reason for this is because even though the genetic code is the same **how the genetic code is expressed changes**.  The proteins that are produced by the DNA is not just controlled by the sequence of DNA, but also the shape of the DNA.. how it's curled, how tightly different parts are wound, and things of that nature.  That can change and also can be inherited.

And there are likely other mechanisms at play also.

**So the diet of your grand parents, their behavior, their environment, and how they lived their lives before they gave birth to your parents does impact you and how your body works.  Even if you never met them and lived a completely different lifestyle.**

&amp;#x200B;

You can see this with your own eyes when you look at things like skin pigments.  African-descendants who have lived several generations in northern USA get lighter and lighter with each successive generation.   Were as many Mexicans are primarily European descendants have become very dark.  You can see them with red hair, which is a very European trait, have skin as dark as anybody's.

And it's not all due to 'race mixing'.  It's real multi-generational inheritable changes that happen due to environment.   Noticeable changes happen in less then 100 years and with generations being around 25 years each.. that means your skin color can naturally change quite significantly in less then 4-5 generations.

&amp;#x200B;

I have to say this girl was very suppotive this year. I saw her one night and she asked me to see her the next evening free of charge.
Then she sent me messages and called me everyday, without asking for anything.


That beeing said, she's 36, I'm 35 and we both have no children.
We talked a lot and I know she's looking for a husband and want a child.
She just said she would like me to give her a baby and she'll take care of everything.

Regardless of morals questions, can I be screwed if I chose to help her like in Europe where a judge can ask for a DNA test and order the guy to provide money for the child ?

Sure you can say that the plea system encourages a lot of people to accept their charges rather than try to fight it. But there is nothing to suggest that there is any significant number of innocent people who take plea deals to go to prison rather than fight it. If you look at the conviction rate it is clear that there is good reason not to go to trial...because if the state is taking you to trial they have damn good reason to pin those crimes on you. To make your argument you would have to believe that the conviction rate for plea bargainers would be significantly lower than that of those who go to trial and that is simply not logically sound. If anything a person who knows they have no chance at trial is more likely to take a plea deal, not the other way around. The reality is that their lawyers look at the evidence and say, ""Dude you're fucked, they have so much shit on you. Just plead guilty and that will turn out best for you.""

&gt; Given the cost of defending yourself in court, and the will documented penalty you incur for rejecting a plea deal and going to trial

80% of criminal cases use court appointed attorneys. They don't pay a cent. The other 20% are wealthy enough to afford their own attorney and hired one which means the cost isn't what concerns them, they just wanted the best representation (who then later tell them against their own interests of making money from the case that their best chance is to take a plea deal because the evidence is not in their favor).

&gt; In order for something to be a crime, there has to be a law forbidding it. It could be we have more criminals because we have made more things illegal...

The US does not have more things that are illegal than europe. Europe has way more restrictions. Generally laws are pretty similar across the world anyway though, no amount of difference in laws could explain those differences.

&gt;Problem: lower class people don't make a living wage

&gt;Solution: raise the minimum wage!

&gt;What Actually Happens: employers employ less lower class people, unemployment rises.

Also outsourcing, robots etc where possible. However, where that isn't possible then wages go up across the sector and some employers go bust and others adapt to the new environment and life goes on.

&gt;Problem: the rich don't pay enough taxes

&gt;Solution: raise taxes on the rich!

&gt;What Actually Happens: the rich evade the new taxes

Nah, they just pay up and then have their minions write articles about moving. Rich people are the demographic least likely to move due to tax hikes and most likely to pay their taxes because going from being rich to being in prison super sucks. Just doesn't happen.

&gt;Problem: rents are too high and landlords are exploitative

&gt;Solution: rent control!

&gt;What Actually Happens: current renters pay the same, landlords pass costs onto newer renters

They actually burn their properties down and claim the insurance because they *cannot* pass the costs on, that's what rent control means. New york in the 1970's is the poster boy for this. This only applies if the properties are bought on leverage mind you, otherwise there is a tendency to just eat losses for a while first, and then to burn the property down.

&gt;Problem: housing isn't affordable

&gt;Solution: mandate affordable housing!

&gt;What Actually Happens: developers don't build at all because they can't recoup costs with affordable housing

Yes, the actual solution is for the government to annex some land and then build the housing itself - see most of western europe post war.

The problem with incentive systems is they can be gamed but that doesn't mean government is powerless, it actually means only direct intervention - literally ""build this house here and sell it at a loss"" etc works.

&gt; Britain does not want illegal immigrants. Yet nor does it want “hostile” systems aimed at removing them. Even when hardline enforcement policies are not deporting Windrush Brits, they’re too often cruel and ineffective. “Enforced returns” are now at a record low: there were fewer than 8,000 last year.

&gt; Britain has between 500,000 and 1.2 million irregular migrants. If we leave the EU and end free movement that figure will rise, along with public demand for a policy response that actually works.

&gt; The Social Market Foundation has an answer. Instead of wastefully trying to round up unauthorised migrants for deportation, we should give them money. Money for a ticket home and the cost of setting up life there, maybe by starting a business. Whitehall officials should support them in resettlement.

&gt; This is assisted voluntary return (AVR) and it should be put at the heart of Britain’s immigration enforcement regime.

&gt; AVR schemes have been tried before on a small scale but were attacked from all sides. Anti-immigration hardliners object to handing money to people who don’t have permission to be here. Yet AVR is much cheaper than harsher methods. It costs about£3,000 to help someone return and resettle freely, or £15,000 to deport them in shackles.

&gt; My fellow supporters of liberal immigration policies often write off AVR as an attack on migrants and their rights. In fact, significant numbers of migrants are keen to go back to their home country and will do so, if offered a helping hand that they can trust.

&gt; My fellow liberals should also accept that, without a policy of completely open borders and a permanent amnesty, any country must have the means to address irregular migration — and in a way that commands public confidence.

Meanwhile Trumptard is the only person in the world taking an actual stand against them. It's sad when a man like that that's so vial is the only 'adult' in the room when it comes to these extreme threats.

Trump is the prime reason why China can encroach on half the world unmolested. Instead of providing a unified front, he's distracting the world with his antics and alienates his allies. First thing he did in office was stepping back from a huge trade agreement, leaving a void China was all to eager to fill. While the public looks at Trump tweets, China encroaches on Africa, buys power in Australia, secures trading routes all over the pacific, isolates India to ensure dominance in Asia and buys favors in Europe.

Now he takes a stand by imposing tariffs. What does China do? They transport their Huawei phones to one of their new-bought friends, put in the last chip and ship it to America tariff free. The oldest trick in the book.

Merkel on the other hand is being pragmatic. If she were to openly oppose China in any way, then she wouldn't get anywhere.

Unlikely. Seeing as how no country in Europe occupied by France actually stayed French. And how nobody would have supported a union of France and Spain. 

And comparing that to the Germany-Austria case shows either huge bias on your part or lack of history knowledge. 

It's much easier for smaller countries to be assimilated into bigger countries than for big countries to assimilate each other. And Germany did assimilate smaller countries. There was support for a united German country that included Austria and what is now Germany. Acting like it's this impossible thing that could have never happened because they're oh so extremely different is ignoring history and how relatively close it came to happening.

&gt;It never ceases to amaze me how people from 'big' countries can't understand the viewpoint of 'small' countries.

Maybe it's people from small countries that cannot understand the viewpoint of bigger territories. 

Nationality and identity is often understood by people of monocultural countries as something that is well defined and has clear boundaries and no ambiguity when in reality it's anything but. 

In the case of Spain, there are plenty of examples. Galicia could have been part of Portugal, the Crown of Aragon could have been its own country, Navarre could have been French, even Spain itself could have ended up speaking Portuguese had history gone slightly differently...

But just like parts of countries could have been their own countries, independent countries could have been parts of bigger countries. 

Why is it that Austria *has to be* a country but not Bavaria? Why can Wales be in the UK but not Ireland? It's not like Bavaria and Wales don't have their own culture and idiosyncrasies. Just because it happened the way it happened, doesn't mean it's the only way it could have gone. And recognizing that shouldn't have people up in arms.

Focusing on these two striking and critical population trends, the report considers replacement migration for eight low-fertility countries (France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, United Kingdom and United States) and two regions (Europe and the European Union). R**eplacement migration refers to the international migration that a country would need to offset population decline and population ageing resulting from low fertility and mortality rates.**

But then you also have biomass, which as non-carbon environmentally unfriendly as it may be, is cheaper and in the case of BECCS, [carbon _negative_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bio-energy_with_carbon_capture_and_storage). IPCC predicting that at around ~$85/t, it'll play a significant role in a carbon neutral future (direct air capture is falling to similar prices, but often comes in at $150/t).

I guess for me, the thing that convinced me most that current nuclear makes no sense was ironically, [MIT's nuclear department](http://energy.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/The-Future-of-Nuclear-Energy-in-a-Carbon-Constrained-World.pdf), in an incredibly biased ""interdisciplinary study"" consisting only of nuclear PhDs and reviewed only by the nuclear industry.

The first giveaway was, well, just that. All authors and reviewers were stacked, because (I assume) the study was flawed and they couldn't get other engineers to sign off on it.

The second, was that they completely ignored biomass - why? I can only assume it was inconvenient, given that it already plays a role in Europe.

But the biggest killer was that they claim to have crunched all the numbers... and on their graphs, you can see that indeed renewables are the cheapest for most grids until you're trying to squeeze the last few % of CO2 out. They then claim that rather than spend $1000/t reducing carbon further, by building bigger and bigger battery banks, and CCS gas backup etc... that you build nuclear from the start.

They had to go _that far_ to be able to make a case for it. Check New England ""optimal configurations"", Texas, UK, France - same story for all. Outside of Zhejiang, until the last few percent of CO2, not even they can make a convincing case for nuclear - and believe me, they've tried.

The problem with all this? Direct air capture, and BECCS, both allow carbon sequestration for less than what they're using to justify nuclear. An _order of magnitude_ less, in some cases. You'll never spend $1000/t building bigger battery banks for those overcast low-wind weeks when you can pay someone $100/t to ""suck emissions back out of the air for you"". And if we don't crack _that_ egg, we're pretty much doomed once more, as there are so many practices that will likely never be carbon neutral on their own terms (agriculture, flights, cement, steel, etc).

Basically, to say we must go nuclear means (a) assuming that storage goes up in price or is impossible (which means we're doomed, as our cars use as much energy as our houses) and (b) that we can never sequester carbon for a reasonable price (which means we're doomed, as people will always eat meat, to say nothing of anything else) and (c) that renewables stop falling in price - preferably 5yrs ago, as it's getting damn inconvenient for nuclear at this point.

One day, I think it'll have a place. Outside of a few niche areas though, there is **no** reason to be betting the planet on it today.

Feels a bit awkward putting my stuff on an official thread but eh, might as well give it a try. I'm choosing Constant, AKA Alice Armstrong, since I think she'd be pretty interesting to write about.

* Someone in the know would recognize her as having mostly European heritage, but might also be able to identify some traces of Native American ancestry. While she looks very young, around 10-11, her mannerisms can make her seem older, though one would probably dismiss that without further information. She doesn't seem to exercise much, judging from her low muscularity.

* Her clothes are a lot more revealing than one would expect from a girl of her age, which points to either questionable choices by her parents or her choosing her own clothes. If in a colder climate it might raise some questions as to her comfort. The symbol many of her shirts have on the front would be recognized as the symbol of Pantheon, a worldwide organization that handles the supernatural, but it's a fairly popular design. The fabric is of high quality, pointing to her family being fairly well off.

* Alice has an accent that an expert could localize to northwestern Canada/Alaska. Her language is more complex than a typical child her age and uses some words that have gone out of use in the past few years, along with a fair bit of Irish slang, but otherwise her vocabulary is on the thinner side. One could draw the conclusion she's very mature for her age, or perhaps trying to imitate an adult, especially when combined with her clothing.

* An ordinary person wouldn't notice most of the subtleties, and would probably believe she's rather precocious when looking closer, and perhaps interested in older media due to her language use. Typically those who don't know her humour her, but many also dismiss her because of how eleven-year-olds don't typically offer much in terms of intelligent conversation.

* If seen in a combat situation, an average perception of Alice might change. Even if not actively fighting, her presence on a battlefield, and the casualness with which she seems to treat it, definitely points to her being Gifted somehow. This goes double considering she doesn't have any gear beyond her normal clothes and a pair of heavy boots. In general, when meeting someone like that on a battlefield, you start running. Her eyes will tell you the same thing. The eyes of someone used to battle. People wouldn't risk engaging her unless they're very sure of themselves or just reckless.

[],,Bobby_Marks2,1387734095.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_egwvt,False,False,[],"I've been on a major classic TV and film kick for the last few years, and the answer is simple - it depends on you. If you can look past the production limitations of the bygone eras to the themes a show offers, or if you can consume media content within a mindset that recognizes historical relevance, then you will find value in old shows. If you can't do that, then time and the Seinfeld Effect will destroy any perceived value old shows may have for you.

It's also important to understand that scripted television in the 1940s-1960s was a fraction of the content we get today. Fraction of a percent even. The television was a way for the world to be brought into living rooms; it was used for news, information and education, and live-broadcast entertainment that had already been popularized by radio. It wasn't until I Love Lucy in 1951 that sitcoms arrived as a force. There weren't enough TV owners to really push cultural awareness of TV shows back then. To quote Wikipedia: ""while only 0.5% of U.S. households had a television in 1946, 55.7% had one in 1954, and 90% by 1962."" Well into the 1950s, radio dominated the broadcast format that Americans and Europeans consumed.

At the same time, I've come to the conclusion that the 1970s was a decade of shows that mostly titillated audiences without offering too much more. It was just before 1970 that detailed demographic research and analysis began to hit the industry, so my best guess is that the 70s was the guinea pig decade for shows designed by market research. Maybe it's my own personal opinion seeping into my judgement, but there just aren't many 70s shows I find worth viewing. In several cases (I Dream of Jeanie, The Brady Bunch, Charlie's Angels, The Six-Million Dollar Man, and others), 70s shows were defined by their premises and don't offer much beyond that. There are exceptions though.

Some shows I believe are worth watching:

- Star Trek goes without saying. It's fantastic science fiction, written by some of the best SF writers of the 20th century. The philosophy from episode to episode is a staple pioneered here. However, it's true value is in the way Roddenberry leveraged his characters: Spock versus Bones as an analog for the value of logic compared to the wisdom of experience. Uhura's presence as a statement about racism in the 1960s. Spock's half-human nature that makes him entirely familiar with human weakness, yet through a dedication to logic being a superior being; Spock systematically bearing the brunt of the human crew's racism (instead of the black woman who sat next to him on the bridge) as a statement about how the inferior mock those they don't understand. Trek also holds a lot of value for remaining unyielding in it's optimism for humankind - something rare in any TV era but essentially non-existent today.
- Twilight Zone. One of the best-written, best-scripted shows ever. If you were to take bets on what currently-existing TV show was still relevant 100 years from now, this would be my pick. It's a raw, exposed nerve of human behavior study, cutting right to the folly that drives the limitations of the human mind. 
- Not that old, but I've been on a Golden Girls kick lately. Old women not being a normal selling point aside, GG holds up incredibly well as comedy. 
- The Prisoner. A spy resigns, attempts to flee the country, but is kidnapped and awakes in a weird town that functions as kind of prison. He is trying to figure out why he is there, while also trying to protect the secrets that townspeople are trying to get out of him. It's like Hot Fuzz meets The Truman Show, but with James Bond and psychological torture. Classic British TV isn't for everyone, but there is nothing like this show on TV.
- If you recognize Twilight Zone's value, Rod Serling's other show (Night Gallery) is similarly fantastic (although more horror fantasy than the Kafkaesque Twilight Zone).
- Sterling had a failed western called The Loner. It failed because it was too adult-oriented and cerebral, and lacked action. It's flawed, but an interesting look at what more mature content looked like in the 60s. 
- Two 70s shows that I believe are a good microcosm of the political, moral, and ethical culture of the decade are MASH and All In The Family. MASH is pretty well represented and understood in modern culture IMO. All In The Family was one of the most powerful sitcoms ever made, because it framed the main character as a normal guy, when he was really a horrible human being who was constantly being confronted by reality and forced to grow as a person. [Here is a 75-second example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70Xtgk03l4Y) of what kind of person he was. I draw some interesting parallels between this show and the boomer-millennial generational conflict we see today.
- I don't know that I could watch all nine seasons of it today, but Little House On The Prarie is like The Sandlot of American Homesteading. 
- There is something about Hogan's Heroes that sticks with me. There was a dark comedy film in the 1950s called Stalag 17, which while funny was also a horrid look at what WWII prison camps were like. Someone in the 1970s decided, ""hey, we should strip out the drama and tragedy and war crimes, and turn it into a sitcom."" It's something that I find relatively easy to binge without having to pay close attention - like good sitcoms usually are.
- I'm not a western guy normally, but Gunsmoke is kind of American television history that can't be ignored. While Giligan's Island and Star Trek each lasted 3 seasons, Gunsmoke had an 11-year run in which it was considered one of the greatest radio dramas ever made - and then it went on to be a 20-season TV show that the Simpsons _just recently_ surpassed as the scripted show with the highest number of episodes. It features two of the only three live-action actors to portray the same character in a scripted show for 20 consecutive years (the other being Kelsey Grammer's Frasier Crane in Cheers and Frasier).",True,False,False,,,0,1575292720,,False,0,{},f9g3l1t,False,t3_e4v6nl,False,False,t3_e4v6nl,/r/television/comments/e4v6nl/what_are_some_older_tv_shows_still_worth_watching/f9g3l1t/,False,,1584312185,15,True,False,television,t5_2qh6e,r/television,public,0,

Malta needs to get money to come back, and soon.

It is a confusion based on the name similarity of Gypsies/Roma/Romanies and Romanians.

The middle east cannot be in control of its own resources because they lack the strength to keep them. The US has interfered and taken its own cut of these resources, not by directly looting them, but by imposing unequal trade deals following our military adventurism, or by bribing despots like Saddam Hussein, and sometimes both. Had the US not done these things, China and Russia would have used their own strategies to accomplish the same.

There will probably always be power struggles, and there is a whole field of study about how to keep the peace in the context of these power struggles.

These ""Status Quo"" powers would value the state of affairs and work to prevent other states from growing to dominance. In any group of 4 or more equal powers, if one grows in power, the other three force the fourth to share the power it gains or be destroyed.

cara, faz uns meses que eu parei de comer  besteira. não adoço as coisas, consumo mais frutas e verduras. tenho diminuído também a quantidade de carboidratos ruins. e te digo, acho que essa foi a melhor escolha desse ano. os benefícios (que me lembro) são:

 - perda de peso;
 - menos a gastrite e refluxo;
 - sono mais regular;
 - &gt;!cocô mais durinho e de coloração saudável!&lt;.

não sei se lembrei de todos, acho que não.

ah, além de tentar me alimentar melhor, tenho tentado cozinhar mais vezes também. até deixei de pedir coisas por ifood, hoje em dia isso raramente acontece. o que faz com que sobre mais dinheiro também.

outra coisa, além da alimentação mais saudável, comecei a tomar kombucha e (apesar de ser um amante da cafeína) tentado beber menos café, prestando mais pela qualidade e tentando diminuir a quantidade. Isso ajuda a flora intestinal e diminui um pouco a ansiedade.

finalmente, também tenho me exercitado mais (claro, isso não tem a ver com alimentação, mas acho que é uma coisa que acontece naturalmente) até comprei uma licença de um ano de um app de calistenia. sempre tento (no mínimo) fazer um alongamento no dia.

Just one.

https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/12/18661708/bernie-sanders-definition-democratic-socialism-explained

Literally googled “Bernie Sanders explains what being a socialist means.” I know you know how to do this. 

&gt;This is another nitpick but this is also false. About two thirds of Americans are insured by the private sector. I guess you could make the case that anybody receiving a subsidy is receiving ""government funded"" health insurance but if that's what you were trying to say then most Americans are being ""government funded"".

43% of all healthcare expenditures are government funded.

https://www.crfb.org/papers/american-health-care-health-spending-and-federal-budget

43% = about half. There’s no nitpick, you just need to actually look up the numbers.

&gt;It's a remarkably inaccurate view of politics to not be able to see that the governments of Sweden, Norway, etc are far closer to us than they are to being socialist nations. I have agreed like 8 times already that nothing Sanders is currently proposing would make us a socialist country; not even close. What I want to know is whether he believes that we should eventually go further.

If you already agree, then this is literally just pointless diversion. And no, it’s remarkably childlike to reduce an entire economic system down to a binary position - one that is so unresponsive that it can’t tell the difference between Something like Sweden, current America, and Bernie’s America. There’s what, literally a handful of countries *on Earth* that you could say are actually socialist according to your model? What’s the point then? It’s not telling us anything meaningful as it relates to the topic *as you’ve already agreed.*

&gt;Well, sort of. In the Netherlands and Switzerland the penalty for not having insurance is higher than the cost of insurance so they kind of make the ACA mandate look like a joke by comparison. There are also some other pretty big differences (i.e. Switzerland turned all insurance companies into non-profits and got rid of employer provided insurance) so I wouldn't just call their systems more tightly regulated versions of our system.


Nothing you’ve said here contradicts anything you’re responding to, why you feel the need to include it, I couldn’t say, because all of which could be summed up as “they have a more tightly regulated version of our system.” Which i.e. is the system that’s left 30 million without health insurance, hasn’t reduced costs for millions of Americans, brings half a million people to bankruptcy every year, and has been susceptible to republican meddling. 

&gt;""Most expensive"" isn't the greatest metric. The Netherlands and (especially) Switzerland are loaded and as a result everything is more expensive there. The Euro Health and Consumer Index has them ranked 1 and 2.

It surely is when America has the highest healthcare spending in the world and we’re trying to figure out how to reduce costs - switching to an outlier model that is the most expensive in Europe, and are already the systems we’re closest to emulating, but hasn’t worked thus far. 

&gt;Oh and Israel, Liechtenstein, Singapore, Germany, Austria, Japan, etc all allow citizens to purchase from private insurance companies. None of these systems work exactly like the US, but the dichotomy of having to go either fully public or fully private is outright false.

Do you even know what % of Germans use private health insurance? Because the answer is about 10%. Austria? Is that the country you look to when you think of an amazing health care system? Do you know how Singapore’s system actually works? Does that seem like something we should emulate to you - where the government *owns* the hospitals? If not, why even bring up examples that you wouldn’t support anyway? None of this obviates the fact that the vast majority of industrialized countries rely on government funded health insurance.

In fact, Huawei is one of the [top 4 mobile phone vendors in South America](https://gs.statcounter.com/vendor-market-share/mobile/south-america) and China’s CCBC and ICBC banks are expanding very rapidly in the region.

3. The Kirschner governments, especially Cristina Kirschner, went to great lengths to improve relations with Cuba and even went on official state visits twice, in 2009 and 2013.

4. Cristina Kirschner made a deal with Iran and covered up their involvement in the 1994 AMIA bombing. [She’s been investigated](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/05/argentina-cristina-fernandez-de-kirchner-trial-bombing) but the trial stalled when it became clear she would be back in power (she’s currently the Vice President-elect) and the lead prosecutor who investigating the AMIA bombing and the cover up, Alberto Nisman, [turned up dead](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/06/argentinian-lawyer-alberto-nisman-was-murdered-police-report-finds) the morning of the day when he was due to testify in congress, 4 days after he accused Cristina Kirschner of the cover up and claimed to have proof.
