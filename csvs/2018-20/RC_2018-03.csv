The grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) is the species of fish with the largest reported production in aquaculture globally, over five million tonnes per year. It is a large herbivorous freshwater fish species of the family Cyprinidae native to eastern Asia, with a native range from northern Vietnam to the Amur River on the Siberia-China border. This Asian carp is the only species of the genus Ctenopharyngodon.

It is cultivated in China for food, but was introduced in Europe and the United States for aquatic weed control.

king-krool,,,"“Conclusions


The empirical evidence of an association between low-density settlement patterns and a high reliance on automobiles on the one hand and between high-density environments and more transit use on the other is firmly established. This chapter is more interested in the dynamics, especially in a policy context, than in the static relationship. Similarities and contrasts between the United States and Western Europe provide a backdrop to this discussion. Many in the planning profession in the United States believe that densification strategies can induce more transit use or, alternatively, investing in more transit will result in higher densities. They look to Europe as a model for this strategy, even though the policy environments are very different (Nivola, 1999). Unfortunately, the facts are against them. Certainly, transit shares are higher in Europe, especially in or close to core cities where densities are higher. But the trends indicate convergence between the United States and Western Europe, with the automobile share rising in the latter despite higher densities and very strong pro-transit policies. Also, all the efforts to promote more transit in the United States have, according to the 2001 NHTS survey, resulted in a declining transit share. The reasons are clear. While you can introduce higher densities in micro-environments, especially if you implement draconian changes in zoning ordinances, making region-wide density changes is like trying to turn an aircraft carrier around. Alternatively, as the Atlanta-Barcelona example illustrates, the investments in public transit required to generate European levels of transit shares are impossibly infeasible. Of course, you make changes at the margin. But the overall assessment is unequivocal. Whatever problems, real or imagined, might be associated with sprawl in the United States, the transit-high density remedy is bound to fail. An intelligent reading of the European experience makes this obvious, despite contrary conclusions drawn by the less well informed. Almost all US cities are caught in a low-density trap from which there is no escape via pipedreams, fantasies or even forceful policies.”",True,0,1519863439,,False,0,duzn9vi,False,t3_80xnov,True,t1_duzf5la,/r/bayarea/comments/80xnov/youre_not_a_progressive_if_youre_also_a_nimby_why/duzn9vi/,1524684400,6,True,False,bayarea,t5_2qjyy,public,

3-Porque a Receita Federal é tão contrária à diminuição da carga tributária no Brasil se já passamos da curva de Laffer direto pro guardrail do dito cujo?

4-Se eu compro uma placa de vídeo do exterior e pago o imposto corretamente, e se posteriormente preciso fazer remessa da mesma placa para o exterior para fins de conserto ou troca por defeito (via RMA), como faço para comprovar que já paguei a tributação daquele produto quando ele retornar ao Brasil se o papel da tributação não parece ter nenhum dado que identifique seu conteúdo, apenas a descrição genérica do tipo do item declarado? Preciso fazer uma declaração específica antes de fazer a remessa? Se sim, como comprovar, aqui mesmo, que já paguei o tributo antes do envio?

5-Pode falar sobre a tributação de bitcoins? Se eu começar a ""minerar"", já devo declarar o valor, ou só quando isso for convertido em moeda corrente? E quem minerava já desde que bitcoin foi criado, como fica a declaração de bens dessa pessoa a partir do momento em que se tornou necessário declarar bitcoin Aliás, qual a natureza jurídica do bitcoin para a Receita Federal?

6-A informatização da tributação de remessas vindas do exterior já terminou?

7-Se eu não me cadastrar nesse serviço dos Correios (em parceria com a receita) de ambiente virtual para pagamento de tributos de remessas do exterior, corro o risco de não receber a remessa?

8-Como é o controle em cima dos funcionários que fazem a separação dos produtos importados para tributação para evitar furtos?

9-Quando uma remessa é aberta para verificação do conteúdo, se o funcionário constata a ausência de algo que deveria estar ali pela natureza do produto (exemplo: nota fiscal cita console + jogo, mas não tem o jogo dentro), vocês criam uma ocorrência interna para que conste que, após a abertura, havia discrepância entre a declaração ou nota fiscal e o conteúdo do pacote?

Yes and no. There is coverage where there are people interested in providing it. Europe is hardly a barren wasteland of random hours. You go to Europe afternoon to evening even on week days and you get a lot of coverage. Weekends is pretty good.

wasd9876,,,"As an Irish person who stumbled on this thread I can tell you what the thoughts are here.

There is more chance of you getting sunburnt in Leicster Square tomorrow night than of the Irish ""blinking first"".

The reasons for this are pretty simple and straightforward:

1. The phase 1 agreement isn't just being put in writing, its going to be a legal agreement that is independent of anything that may or may not happen with the phase 2 negotiations.

2. David Davis and his big mouth have ensured that the legal text will be drawn up in even more detail than previous to ensure that the Tories have no wiggle room on the agreement.

3. The legal text will say (having been agreed in December) that if nothing better is agreed in phase 2 (such as a UK-EU customs union) then the worst scenario will be that Northern Ireland remains in the single market and the customs union. The Irish and the EU have exactly what they want already on the Northern Ireland border. There's no reason to blink and a no deal in phase 2 still means no border in the North.

4. The Irish economy does stand to take a hit if theres no phase 2 agreement, but nowhere near the extent of the UK. The Irish will lose out on UK beef sales for example, but there'll also be a gap in the market from British beef exports that we can fill, and I can almost guarantee that the EU will make funds available for Ireland to deal with the transition that will leave us in a very, very strong position to capitalise on those gaps.

5. Theres a reason that the UK have conceded on almost every demand the EU has made in negotiations, its because the UK has no leverage. No deal will decimate the UK economy, hurt the Irish and be an inconvenience to the EU. Everyone in power knows this. All the Tories are doing are biding their time to make things palatable for the Leavers and for the Tories so the government doesn't fall.

If anyones expecting the negotiations to suddenly do a 180 and for the Tories to suddenly start taking control and getting what they want (or the ridiculous idea of leaving with no deal) then they're not paying attention to all the underlying facts and ignoring how phase 1 played out.",True,0,1519873163,,False,0,duzw70w,False,t3_80kr82,True,t3_80kr82,/r/ukpolitics/comments/80kr82/will_ireland_blink_first_when_it_comes_to_the_ni/duzw70w/,1524689006,1,True,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,public,

(2009) Way &amp; Lieberman analyze genetic contribution to cultural differences in this piece and draw support for dual-inheritance theory.

They show that there are genetic predispositions for IQ, collectivism, individualism, a wide breadth of aspects of socialization, depression, and other psychocultural phenomena which determine the values of societies and their people. They show that populations have mean genetics which means they have mean dispositions and thus mean personalities as well and thus cultures are formed around those same means.

These findings are supported by (Simoons, F, 1969; Simoons, F, 1970; Cavalli-Sforza, Menozzi &amp; Piazza, 1994; Holden &amp; Mace, 1997; Durham, 1991; Perry et al., 2007; Campbell, 1965; McElreath &amp; Henrich, 2007; Kroeberm &amp; Kluckhohn, 1952; Sasaki, 2013; Cochran &amp; Harpending, 2009; Bentley, Hahn &amp; Shennan, 2004; Boyd &amp; Richerson, 1985; Gabora, 1995; and so many more)

(2006) Templer &amp; Arikawa analyze populations by temperature, skin color, per capita income, and IQ and find stark correlations between all of them.

They were able to accurately predict individual IQ by skin color (0,92), mean high Winter temperature of their race (0,76), mean low Winter temperature of their race (0,66), and per capita income (0,63). These findings provide strong support for the idea that colder climates caused selection for higher IQs over an evolutionary epoch.

(2005) Mekel-Bobrov et al., conclude that the gene ASPM is a specific regulator of brain size, and its evolution in the lineage leading to Homo sapiens was driven by strong positive selection. They show that one genetic variant of ASPM in humans arose merely about 5.800 years ago in Eurasia and has since swept to high frequency across Eurasia under strong positivel selection.

The gene is almost non-existent in Sub-Saharan Africa.

https://www.ucl.ac.uk/tcga/tcgapdf/Thomas-99-intelligence.pdf

(1998) Thomas, Miller &amp; Mascie-Taylor conclude that the EST00083 (""expressed sequence tag"") is an mtDNA (mitochondrial; maternal) polymorphism found more often in high IQ groups. It is particularly common in Europe (less so in Asia) where it is associated with a lineage that dates back 35.000 years. It is nearly non-existent in Africa.

This finding goes along with a discovery by Turner &amp; Partington in 1991 that shows mothers are the primary component in a child's intelligence.

https://www.jstor.org/stable/2999198?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents

(1998) The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education concludes that at all family income levels, there is a persisting racial gap in SAT scores and that the poorest White children outperform the richest Black children. This further suggests that environment is not the explanation for intelligence or the racial testing gap.

These findings are supported by (Binkley &amp; Collin, 2013; North Carolina SAT Report, 2010; Dixon-Roman &amp; Ezekiel et al., 2013; La Griffe du Lion Volume II Number III, 2000; Wightman, 1994; Murray &amp; Herrnstein, 1996; Scarr &amp; Weinberg, 1983; Scarr &amp; Weinberg, 1976; Ciotti, 1998; Arthur Jensen, 1998; Keyes et al., 2009; Miller et al., 2012; Hicks et al., 2004; Iacono et al., 1999; Hur &amp; Bouchard, 1995; Alford, Funk &amp; Hibbing, 2005; Block &amp; Block, 2005; Bouchard et al., 2012; Lykken et al., 1993)

(2002) Davide Piffer concludes that the genes rs9320913 (A), rs3783006 (C), rs8049439 (T), rs13188378 (G), rs11584700 (G), rs4851266 (T), rs2054125 (T), rs3227 (C), rs4073894 (A) and rs12640626 are genes associated with intelligence and brain-size.

rs236330 is a gene strongly expressed in neurons, including hippocampal neurons and developing brains, where it regulates neuronal morphology.

rs324650 is a gene involved in neuronal excitability, synaptic plasticity and feedback regulation of acetylcholine release.

East Asian populations (Japanese, Koreans, Bei-Chinese) have the highest average frequency of these alleles (39%) with the slimmest curve of distributions. Europeans have the second-highest amount of these alleles (35,5%) with a right-leaning and wide curve. Sub-Saharan Africans have the lowest frequencies of these alleles (16,4%) with a remarkably slim curve of distributions.

He states that these are not the only genes associated with intelligence but they are some of the known genes for intelligence and brain-size determination. They vary in prevalence across different populations and are evidence of recent polygenic selection.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18292342

(2008) Li JZ et. al., show the distinct population groups of the Earth by genetically testing individuals from each population group and mapping them by their single nucleotide polymorphisms.

Only three groups - South Asians, Central (West) Asians, and East Asians have overlaps while Middle Easterners, Central Asians, and Indian South Asians have genetic contributions from European population groups. There is no genetic continuum between Africans and any other population group alive. The 40.000 years of evolution put between the rest of Mankind and Africans can be shown as the source of this.

This finding is supported by (Lao et. al., 2006; Costas et. al., 2005; Xing et. al., 2010 (1); Xing et. al., 2010 (2); Jakobsson et. al., 2008; Huang et. al., 2011; Paşaniuc et. al., 2010; Huang et. al., 2009; Hao et. al., 2009; Nothnagel et. al., 2009; Chanda et. al., 2012)

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1893020/

(2007) Witherspoon et. al., conclude that Lewontin's Fallacy that individuals within populations are more genetically unique than between populations is false when more than one genetic variable is used.

They show that Lewontin's Fallacy is based upon cherry-picked selection of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms common to all humans and upon selecting for as few as two single nucleotide polymorphisms the differences become readily apparent and classable. Genetic stratification as a result of this is inevitable without cherry-picking.

WikiTextBot,,,"**Galah**

The galah  (Eolophus roseicapilla), also known as the rose-breasted cockatoo, galah cockatoo, roseate cockatoo or pink and grey, is one of the most common and widespread cockatoos, and it can be found in open country in almost all parts of mainland Australia.

It is endemic on the mainland and was introduced to Tasmania, where its distinctive pink and grey plumage and its bold and loud behaviour make it a familiar sight in the bush and increasingly in urban areas. It appears to have benefited from the change in the landscape since European colonisation and may be replacing the Major Mitchell's cockatoo in parts of its range.

The term galah is derived from gilaa, a word found in Yuwaalaraay and neighbouring Aboriginal languages.

The same Prophet who explained first that cyclical theory was the core lie used to cover-up the fundamental Law governing the second age, mathematically maximally reduced returns an exponential curve.  
The same Prophet who predicted and explained that imminent end of age was the reason to launch military Armageddon, with the ultimatum to Serbia, the 13 October 1998 deadline.

World War III: original script released 1943 was a remake of original WW2 script, two of the ultimate reductions of illuminati end times.  
The first reduction is implicitly stated: again the same original script.  
The second reduction is what the original script was: a fake war with real blood.  
The ultimate reason for all this: proving the illuminati anti-bible true, in particular that ""Armageddon is a lie"".  
At the end of the day not only WW2  but also World War III started as a real war mixed with fake wars.  
As expected from the Laws of End Times Reductionism some of these fake wars were additionally reduced to fake blood.

2 Thessalonians 2:3-4
Psalm 95:5
1 Chronicles 16:26
1 Corinthians 10:20

The people who do not worship the god of Christianity are not worshiping god, but devils. 

&gt; Pope Pius XI, Mortalium Animos (#10) 6 Jan 1928: “This Apostolic Sea has never allowed itself to take part in the assemblies of non-Catholics.”

The whore of Babylon is the false bride, which is the entire Vatican II council.  Reference Our lady of La Salette.

&gt; Our Lady of La Salette 19 Sept 1846: “Rome will lose the faith and become the seat of the Antichrist. The church will be in eclipse.”

By spiritual fornication, the entire Vatican II council leads people away from the true Catholic Church and towards apostasy. Europe will only leave the true Catholic Church to only being small fragments of believers, while Christian Europe becomes pagan again.

This is a nice column for various reasons, but I am sure this thread will appreciate it as an exposition of the ""intra-social trust makes societies work; ethnic homogeneity makes intra-social trust"" line of reasoning that doesn't overhype it to the point of absurdity. I'm wondering how it will be received -- paradigm shift or giant shitstorm, or both?

One issue she seems to ignore, though it almost screams out from her writing, is the issue of size -- what if a small country like Denmark can enjoy more trust in institutions and in each other than a half-continent like the USA because *societies just don't scale*, and people naturally distrust a government a thousand miles away more than they would a government made of their townsfolk? Once again, this is not an all-explainer -- but it should be helpful in making sense at least of the differences in *trust in institutions*. Americans have been deploring the Feds for ages; most Europeans have been reasonably content with their governments at least until the migration crisis. But ask how much they like the EU, and suddenly a different tenor emerges.",True,0,1519878629,,False,0,dv010ur,False,t3_80d7m8,False,t3_80d7m8,/r/slatestarcodex/comments/80d7m8/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_february_26/dv010ur/,1524691517,46,True,False,slatestarcodex,t5_30m6u,public,

lacraquotte,,,"Usual extreme exaggeration when it comes to China. First of all household debt is very mild here (I live in China) compared to other countries, in fact it [is among the lowest in the world](https://www.statista.com/statistics/738695/household-debt-gdp-globally-by-country/). China has more of a problem with State Owned Entreprises debt but that's a totally different issue.

Secondly, the user said it best: buying a property here is extremely restricted. In Shanghai where I live for instance you need to put crazy down-payments in order to buy a flat (north of 50%), you need to have a hukou here (chinese province residency system), etc. In other words it's nothing like the real estate bubble in the US where everyone and their mother was given enormous amounts of debt: the requirements to get debt here are among the most drastic in the world, by far! Only extremely solvent people get debt so the likelihood that a big proportion of those loans would default is close to null. 

Lastly he claims Chinese properties have no intrinsic value because it's just speculation: those properties aren't even occupied. Well bad news for him: ghost cities, ghost apartment complexes, etc. are pretty much a legend. Vacancy rates in China are around 13% on average  for housing ([Harvard study on this](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/weihuang/files/chinaboom_final.pdf)) which, while relatively high, is really far from critical. If you want a US comparison, Alabama is currently at 15%, North Dakota at 17% and Hawai at 10% ([according to the US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/data/rates.html)). Ghost cities are by and large a fabrication by Western media. I just googled ""China ghost cities"" and stumbled upon [this extraordinary Guardian article on ""European-style ghost towns around Shanghai""](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/gallery/2015/jul/23/shanghai-china-european-style-ghost-towns-in-pictures): it just so happens that I've personally visited each and every single city mentioned in there (in fact I was in Thames Town 2 months ago with my daughter) and none of them are ghost cities, they're all bursting with activity. It's fake news, pure and simple, the blatant fakery just blows my mind... Have I visited each and every single town that western media claim are ghost cities?

neoshero,flag landskap-smaland,Småland,"&gt;I flera år har det så kallade utstationeringsdirektivet varit en hjärtefråga för den svenska regeringen. Direktivet reglerar vad som gäller för arbetare som är anställda i ett EU-land, men som tillfälligt jobbar i ett annat EU-land, till exempel lastbilschaufförer och byggnadsarbetare.  
Enligt det nya direktivet ska lika lön och ersättningar, som traktamenten till exempel, gälla både svensk och utländsk arbetskraft. Det nya direktivet har varit en stridsfråga i EU där flera länder i öst motsatt sig det.  

Verkar som att det kommer bli svårare att importera billig arbetskraft i syfte för att lönedumpa  numera, om man nu måste ge dem lika lön. Frågan är vad detta kommer påverka ekonomimässigt. Min första tanke är att det blir ännu dyrare att bygga där lönedumpning sker i stor skala.

TheIdSay,,,"i wanna preface this message by saying that i'm a male pretty deep on the spectrum that found this subreddit while searching for the aspergers discord.

firstly, i don't think aspergers is gonna come in the way of you finding someone that likes you more than, say, an interest in video games or an energetic attitude is. it's a part of you. it's not a disease nor a hindrance (although it may feel like it in our currently very nt-taylored society). eventually you will find someone that not only ""gets"" you or ""can live with you"", but rather, loves every part of you, for who you are everything included.

most likely though they will have to either be slightly on the spectrum(whether they know or not) or at least have worked with people on the spectrum. thing is though, it's always gonna be hard communicating/being compatible with nt's. some people are able to, and god bless them.

but in my personal experience, despite me not really being interested in relationships (seems like too much of a bother and life adjustment), i find that any sort of relation with nt's to be... tricky

often times the fact that i'm open, honest and straight forward to even strangers makes people think i'm trying to gain something from them. or that i'm just talking to them to hit on them (has happened more times than i wanna think about), or that if i critique them it means i'm trying to hurt them(a tendency i've found with nt's is that they tend to think being honestly critiquing is some sort of personal attack. even less acceptable if not really close friends, even if they straight up ask for critique it tends to mean ""say nice things about this"". fucking inbetween the lines stuff. if there was meant to be anything inbetween the lines, why not just make another line and say it straight out).

not sure if this is a cultural thing(i am from europe, many i talk to are americans, country of the sexually repressed) or autism thing, but another thing that i can relate to, is the fact that i'm very open and relaxed about sexual stuff. however in my case, no matter how much i think i'm toning it down for the sake of peoples comfort levels, the slightest crack that shows i don't think like them, and i'm considered a pervert to some, while others thinks it's awesome. what's bad to some is great to others.

my point is, every part of you is great the way it is :) someone you can be ""yourself"" around without having to try and communicate in their manner. and eventually you'll find someone who loves all of you. be proud of those strengths :) don't let anyone tell you how you're supposed to be \^.^ and hey, the ""there's only one for everyone"" is kinda a myth, so chances are, even with a bunch of heart breaks, you'll find someone for you one day :) even if it takes like 10 years more",True,0,1519885017,,False,0,dv05huv,False,t3_8003s6,True,t3_8003s6,/r/aspergirls/comments/8003s6/mutual_breakup_but_still_sad/dv05huv/,1524693912,1,True,False,aspergirls,t5_31zba,public,
TenSevenTN,,,"When the founders wrote the second amendment you could own a cannon and a naval frigate, so until you write that message on parchment and have it delivered to my house by a guy on a horse, that argument is invalid.  The second amendment was written by a group of men who were fighting a bloody war to get free of a tyrannical government.  The second amendment is the last fail safe to assure that the people maintain control.  “The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants”. This was the mentality at the time, and still is. Do you think if Donald Trump could crown himself supreme god emperor he would?  I do. 

But putting all that aside, I am a police detective. I see the horrible things people do to each other every day. In a rural jurisdiction where police response time can be 45 minutes to an hour, I have personally seen guns used to save more lives than they take, and prevent countless violent crimes.  There are 300 million guns in this country. The bad guys have them.  They will continue to have them. Your argument is that the best way to protect the elk from the lion is to remove the elk’s antlers.  If someone is trying to force entry into your home to do you harm, you can defend yourself or you can wait to die.  There are background checks and systems in place, but a system is only as good as the data going into it. The Las Vegas shooter would have passed any background check. The most recent shooter would have been prevented from buying a gun if not for the gross negligence of the local Sheriffs Office not properly following up on numerous complaints. 

We just have different philosophies on how to deal with this. I’m firm in my position as I’m sure you are.  But please don’t condescend me like I am some uneducated yokel, because I guarantee that I understand violent men better than you do.  The United States isn’t Europe. The guns are here and aren’t going anywhere. Culturally and Demographically we are very different. We have a horrible problem with violent gangs and drugs, which account for the vast majority of our homicides.  I’m a firm believer that every person has a right to defend themselves. I am also a firm believer that they have access to the tools needed to do so.

TezakKaoKonj,,,"This should be on top. It's an unpopular opinion, because we rightly feel that joining NATO would be an awful thing to do, but from a pragmatic standpoint it's the only option. 

Being a member of NATO provides more options in case of any dispute with another NATO member... and unfortunately, Serbia has a number of such disputes, both active and potential. Being an outsider seriously limits our options, and ensures we'll get screwed again.

Another factor is Russia. Sure, we love our brothers and all, but Russia's geopolitical interest is to destabilize Serbia and keep it as a wedge in the Balkans, to be used against EU/NATO as occasion requires. Sure, they'll show token support (as they've done in the past), and tell us what we like to hear, but will not meaningfully defend or protect our interests. I don't see being in between Russia and EU as being in Serbia's interest either -- times have changed, and unlike Yugoslavia, we're not big enough (or clever enough) to play them off against each other. 

Now, I personally dislike NATO as much as the next person (they did bomb us, and take some of our territory, after all). Moreover, joining NATO feels a bit like paying off or joining the mafia so they'd protect you from themselves. However, other options are bleak.

In what way does the government manage all our resources? Especially the federal government.

&gt;The government controls medicine

Only new medicines, like medical research. If it came down to armed conflict, the valuable medicines would be antibiotics and stimulants. Which I think non-governmental forces would have plenty of access to both.

&gt;the money supply

In an armed conflict, it won't be the dollar that would be the most valuable. It will be ammunition and shit. So sure, the fed can fuck with interest rates. But that's not what a militia will give a shit about at the time.

This one you have a point, to a degree. Depending on who's on what side. Rebel forces would probably lose GPS to some degree.

ianandris,,,"I agree with some of what you said, disagree with a few other points, but I think it's worth pointing out that we're both speaking from very different perspectives.

where we agree: 
1. law abiding citizens don't perpetuate mass murder. 

2. there is something dark happening with *some people* in the US that isn't happening elsewhere and it isn't strictly gun culture, though gun culture is a facet of eproblem. 

3. outright banning things has a tendency to make problems worse by ceding regulation and distribution of goods to the black market. This results in an increase of criminal behavior in general. 

4. There is a strong mental health component that remains unaddressed. 

Where we disagree: 

1. The law is not meaningless in preventing the use of some kind of weaponry by malicious actors. There is a reason fully auto weapons were not used in those incidents, and that reason is they are hard to obtain. The Vegas shooter, for instance, was using bump stocks for that reason. I have no doubt if he could have obtained a fully auto weapon, he would have used it on those concert goers. From a policy perspective, it's worth examining what legislation made those weapons hard to obtain and how that legislation which had already proven effective can be leveraged to limit there use of other destructive weaponry. This part isn't about addressing the reasons, is about minimizing risk. Not the whole solution, but definitely a part of the solution. 

2. The solutions you suggested are in almost every case more difficult to implement stateside than reregulating the availability of assault weapons. Counseling costs money and in a state where healthcare is considered the responsibility of the individual and is often prohibitively expensive, how would we ensure people who need help get help? Half the country is perfectly okay with letting kids suffer because of their parents choices and even half measures like Obamacare were/still are being fought tooth and nail. There is no consensus that everyone should even *have* access to healthcare. This requires at least as significant a shift in political will as better gun regulation. That said, I agree that addressing the health aspect is likely the single most important thing we can do. Unfortunately, this won't become politically viable until after Democrats control government. 

Police reactivity is honestly not the issue here. Most of these mass murderers are not the demographic being subjected to violence from the pd. These are largely white kids/men from typically affluent suburban areas. The Orlando shooter, an ISIS affiliate, was actually an outlier for the US and, frankly, at this point its looking like Europe has a bigger Islamic terrorism problem than the US. 9/11 was almost 20 years ago. 

Limiting media fame could make a difference, sure, and steps are being taken by many news agencies to do just that, but legislating how media report on incidents is a 1st amendment (free speech) issue that is unequivocally an even bigger political problem than better gun regulation. There is *no* public will, no stomach, no desire to begin regulating speech like that. It's about the only place where conservatives and liberals can agree (though conservatives would have you think that liberals want to abolish it altogether. This is a blatant lie.). All that said, everyone knows who Anders Brevik is, you know? Treating these guys like Voldemort isn't really addressing anything of substance because it assumes the motive for these killers is simply fame. I don't know if that's true. It may be in some cases, but it's really just guessing at motives and painting with a broad stroke. 

I actually think this is the rotten thing: the ""rugged individualism"" some have taken to be a core American value justifies indifference at best if not outright contempt for the common good. This allows all sorts of sickness to take root in the mind of a society. It is permissive of greed, abuse of position for personal gain, and death and destruction of others because they don't deserve to live if they can't make it on their own. This results in a situation where a lot of young white men grow up feeling powerless and subject to extreme pressures to succeed. 

They see circumstances visibly stacked against them. Since they are isolated from real, diverse community, they often feel like noone is fighting for them, they feel forgotten. They lash out at ""social justice warriors"" because they see them advocating almost entirely for the causes of girls, women, and minorities, groups they will never be a part of, and they end up feeling forgotten, powerless, worthless until proven otherwise. It's a truly toxic combination rooted in the aforementioned individualism and exacerbated by social isolation. Most young men move past that feeling by developing social networks (this is where community helps a lot), but some broken folks simply become resentful and hateful of everyone and everything. Some of them self segregate into communities of like minded resentful people and thats where you get the increasing levels of indiscriminate violence.

Oh, and you know when politicized messages about individualsm became more prevelant?

I apologize for a **very** long post incoming but it sounds like you're interested in the subject, so maybe something I'll say here might be informative.

There is some documentation and historical fencing manuals that will talk about dueling opponents in ""full harness"" (fully armored) but most of what we have that survives is related to civilian dueling contexts where it was assumed that you wouldn't have much armor, maybe just the thicker quilted clothing common to a lot of northern/western Europe (which is actually not bad if the opponent's biomechanics are generally bad or if he whiffs a strike). 

However, from historical accounts that we've aggregated, in general when you came across armored opponents on a battlefield, if for whatever unlikely reason you were in a 1v1, and all you had was a bladed weapon like a longsword or something poke-y but won't pierce armor strongly like a spear, you'd probably have to grapple the dude onto the ground and either cut up his harness (straps if it was cheaper gear and they were exposed), stab him in the visor (effective, with caveats), or stab him in other spots where armor just can't be placed like the palms, the groin, armpits, back of the knees, etc.

That's a very sweeping generalization and circumstances and context matters *a* *lot*. For example, you may not want to kill the guy even if it's entirely within your ability to do so. Ransoms for knights and other nobles got you a pretty decent sum and you usually wouldn't get nearly as much stigma as you would for murdering the dude (especially if he surrendered). 

Another thing to consider is that grappling is not ideal combat-wise because while weapons are almost like levers and don't require much more than a minimum of physical strength to use and they rely more on biomechanics and skill, grappling is much more influenced by physical strength differences, at least to a greater degree than combat with weapons. Theoretically if he was losing in a long/mid-range fight with polearms or swords but you went to grapple him and he's bigger than you *and* not much less competent in grappling, he could turn the tables on you!

It's also not great because there's a good chance that while you're holding a dude down and trying to figure out a way to disable him, a friend of his will knock you over the back of the head while you're distracted. 

Full scale battles also varied greatly by culture, time period, circumstances, terrain, and so on, and were actually much rarer compared to sieges and raiding (because of how risky and game-changing field battles could be), but in *general*, in European warfare from the high Middle Ages to the late middle ages until about the Hussite Wars (maybe Crecy and other Hundred Years' War battles), there was an effective convention. Basically the idea was that your archers might soften up the enemy in the initial stages of the battle, make them feel pressured and harass more lightly armored soldiers and horses. 

Contrary to popular culture, arrows were *not* effective against full armor, not even mail armor. (Bit of a tangent, but arrows that were effective against mail armor like bodkins were actually very bad against quilted/padded armor worn underneath mail armor, and vice versa for arrows effective against under armor). Even crazy high poundage bows made famous by the Welsh and English longbowman or those nutty windlass crossbows can't pierce breastplates. What they *can* do is soften up the enemy and injure horses, or otherwise affect morale. 

After the initial skirmishing stages are over, then your infantry with polearms would move in to maneuver and engage. Contrary to popular culture (again), swords - while versatile, were not effective in the slightest in this stage of the battle. No one would carry it as a primary weapon at this *point* but we'll come back to that. The infantry would maneuver to a point that they would try to open up a gap or expose a flank, or separate enemy lines if they could (again, all very dependent on how the battle goes, coordination, tactics, leadership, and so, so many factors), so that the heavy cavalry could charge into the 'breach'. 

While horses and knights both are not stupid enough to ride blindly into pikes, when there's an opening and they can exploit it - chaos usually ensues for the side being charged. Pikes and other polearm formations are effective when coordinated, well-led, and skillful, but they're also very bad at battlefield mobility and staying coordinated if the tide starts to turn. Examples would be the death/capture of a leader, significant losses, or something that just makes you naturally shit your trousers like seeing hundreds of heavily armored knights atop massive destrier warhorses or crazy fast coursers charging at your line's weak spot.

Once the enemy starts to break formation, that's actually where the *most* casualties and injuries will happen. If it's total chaos on one side (a rout), then in breaking if individual opponents stay behind to fight, they essentially get overwhelmed and ganked (sound familiar?). If they run, either the heavy cavalry or much more likely, the light cavalry that was skirmishing, scouting, or harassing in the initial stages of the battle will ride the runners and stragglers down, assuming they don't surrender entirely. (This is also where swords are much more useful, due to their versatility and the lack of pitched battle). While it seems cruel and merciless, unfortunately it was during that stage of the battle that an army could find the only opportunity to inflict lasting and meaningful damage on enemy armies, and in those times it took months or even years to replenish levies and train knights, etc. Especially if they were specialty troops like the veteran English longbowmen - after those famous archers were slaughtered at the Battle of Patay (which was to France what Agincourt and Crecy were to England), there was a good chance that their numbers might never be replenished.

If the breaking is better coordinated or rallied, or the victors are too worn down or tired to pursue, then it's only a retreat and the losing army will have some losses but the consequences aren't utterly catastrophic. 

That's kind of the meta, if you will, of a lot of continental European warfare. Again, it's really hard to generalize like this, but it's the best I can do. If you want to find more reading, especially more contextual and specific reading, finding reputable modern scholars who have actually looked at primary sources and consulted archaeological evidence is of **prime** importance. If the author isn't backing up claims with as many primary sources as can be found, has a transparent agenda, isn't respected in the historical community, etc. etc. then he or she isn't worth wasting the time to read.

Jora_,,voted to leave SM + CU and negotiate a UK-EU FTA,"&gt;Notice the completel lack of remain campaigners telling us how wonderful it would be once brussels was ruling us fully and we were part of a federation.

Not just during the campaign, but ever since. Pretty much the only counterargument that seems to be made against brexit (in the press, and on this sub) is an economic one. 

I'm not even suggesting that that isn't a fair line of attack (and frankly I voted leave fully aware that there would likely be an economic hit). However, I've not seen any answer from Remain-supporters that deal with the issues that actually resulted in the Leave vote.

It's especially important if a second referendum does come about. If Leave voters mainly are looking for immigration control, ""sovereignty"" (no ECJ jurisdiction, the UK not being swallowed up into a federal U.S.E.) and the ability to trade more openly with the rest of the world, the Remain side are going to have to come up with an angle to convince those voters that these issues are either not important (tricky), or can be dealt with as a member of the EU (very tricky).

This is why I'm convinced that a second referendum would result in another narrow Leave vote. You aren't going to convince people to swap sides by focusing on economic damage which many Leave voters *expected*. You have to directly address the issues that *did* cause the Leave vote.

Abuser_Name,tr,Turkey,"Some additional points:

1) Any analysis about current Turkish mindset is not complete without identifying the process in which Ottoman Empire (OE) had collapsed. Ottomans were highly pragmatic and knowledgeable in lots of areas, except, in my opinion, public finance. They observed and studied French Revolution and its consequences as well as colonialization and other stuff closely. They tried to build a colony like establishments in Indonesia (look at the flags of Indonesia, Malaysia,  etc and also other North African states who were taken by other Imperial Powers by force from Ottomans before any local independence movements had developed). First railroad in Ottoman Empire was built in 1856-1866. First urban subway (1875), first constitution (1876) in which muslim and non muslim ethnicities got promising rights. Ottomans were in a very pro western route voluntarily which was indeed promoted by Britain and France. So, what happened? Actually Russia happened. In 1877 Russia defeated Ottomans with the help of the local Slavic communities who were being given rights. This war also make British and French to change their minds from promoting Ottomans as a pro western power resisting Russia to take whatever slice for themselves. Reason: Ottoman Empire was weak, not worth to be promoted, hence ""the ill man of the Europe"". After that point Ottomans saw that whatever they do, nearly every identity under their reign turned against them. A tragic thing that, while these things were happening, Ottomans lacked any sort of identity in modern sense. A nation had to be founded immediately but in actuality there were none. First written document about referring to any kind of Turkish nationalism dates only 1908 which discusses three alternatives. i) to be ""Ottoman"", ii) to be ""Muslim"" or iii) to be Turkish. The same author wrote also ""The Essentials of Turkish Nationalism."" And this part is I think to be interesting for any contemporary reader: the author of those was an ethnic Kurd. During those years of founding Turkish nationalism, the first Turkish novel was written by an ethnic Albanian who also wrote the first play in Turkish language, whose brothers are the leaders of Albanian independence movement and arrested while fighting against Ottomans, and that play mentioned was staged by an Armenian and so on. In my opinion, Turkish identity and nationalism is designed and fabricated by the cosmopolitan elite of the dying Ottoman Empire. Those elit was struggling to find a means to survive under the same flag without accepting any other imperial or national identity that they do not define themselves with.

2) During these attempts of modernization of the Ottoman Empire, a need of centralization of power emerged. These efforts of centralization cause resistance among long time allies of Ottomans, like Bosnians and yes Kurds. Both of these ethnicities were very loyal to Ottomans when they were autonomous but turned hostile against centralization  efforts. These resistance movements are silenced by force. Rebellions were somewhat routine businesses for any empire, and those were regarded just another rebellion. Actually ethnic Turks may have a longer track of rebellions against Ottomans than these two ethnicities, I am not an expert on that subject.

3) After WWI, Ottoman Empire collapsed officially and  beyond no hope. The project of a nation building started by the Ottoman elite finished by Atatürk by founding the new Turkish Republic. Atatürk was a genius and an extreme pragmatist. Mainly there were two ethnicities left loyal somehow. Turkish and Kurds. Turks by elimination of others and left nowhere to go, Kurds by the threat of Shiite Iran and Armenians backed by Russians officially pronouncing ethic cleansing against muslims like the ones successfully done in several regions in the Balkans recently, and both the threat of foreign ""infidel"" rulers. Atatürk probably made a promise about autonomy to Kurds until the new state is founded. Like the other promises given to Soviet Russia (to promote communist movement in Anatolia) and to muslims in India (to defend the caliphate against infidel imperials), he did not fulfill the promise of giving autonomy to them (because the experience of Ottomans giving privileges to some identity and finding that identity against itself with an imperial ally repeated over and over). Well prophecy fulfilled itself and guess what? Kurds rebelled again just after the new state was established again allied with an imperial power: the British. This rebellion again silenced by force. But this time it was no routine business, this time it was a matter of survival. After 1920's, until 1980's Turkey could not find a solution other than postponing the problem. During that era Turkey being a member of NATO within a Cold War frame helped any major imperial power using that soft spot against Turkey. The only exception to that is Syria (who was at that time an ally of Soviets whom would support any movement that would weaken any NATO member). Hafız Esad, father of Basser, had a dream of annexing Hatay from Turkey to Syria. Actually, imo, he has more contribution during the foundation of PKK than Abdullah Öcalan himself. Afrin if not first was one of the first places that PKK find a base even in 1980's. This part is important because of the sentimental value of Afrin for PKK/PYD/YPG/PGJ/KCK/TAK or whatever any Apoist establishment. Especially considering Afrin, OOB is a revenge of last 40 years of PKK violence for an average Turkish. What they call themselves are not important, any Apo poster is enough for them to be arrested, any gun barrel pointed (regardless of any reason to be stated) to any citizen of Turkey is enough for them to be ""neutralized"". Not because they are Kurds, not even they rebelled, because they ally with an imperial power against them. This pattern rings an alarm bell that warns about an existence of a matter of survival situation. And once this alarm is triggered, I recommend any outsider not to expect any rational and/or civilized reactions from Turks. Any living organization behaves differently and of course dangerously, when there is a matter of survival. Most of the Turks believe that, if that Gulenist coup had succeeded, they would go after Hatay from their base in Afrin. So any aggression against Afrin or other YPG held areas, is a message to US, who is perceived as the real threat.

4) In spite of hundreds of years of bloody affairs, Turks and Kurds are mostly ok to live together. There are millions who are half Turkish half Kurdish. Majority of Kurdish people live in Turkish dominated urban areas. If center of gravity for Kurds was towards independence, whatever Turks (us) did, they would have their independent state by now. Maybe if Turkey was not in ME, they would have their state in peaceful terms, who knows. But this is ME, and an independent Kurdish State would be an open prison for them. They know it and this causes a base of natural alliance that endured all impossible times since 15'th century until now. For me first condition for the promise given by Atatürk to be fulfilled is Turkey herself to feel powerful enough in order not to get alerted by an outsider imperial intervention to cause another hostile division. Second condition is that any pro Kurdish movement should be peaceful and pro Turkish, not pro British, pro Soviet or pro USA. As long as these conditions are satisfied I would be very happy to negotiate any Kurd about any rights that they demand.

C-Jen,,,"Whatever the expansions are, they'd have to stick with canon, so we probably won't see any of the EU stuff, which is a shame.

If I could dream up an expansion, it would be a Thrawn expansion. (There is already one such fan made expansion on BoardGameGeek, which came out before the Rise of the Empire official expansion.) I haven't really followed much of the canon Thrawn, beyond the book (which appeared to have lots of references I didn't get to Rebels), but the EU Thrawn legends were amazing.

One that lends itself very well to the galactic scale could be the Thrawn/Zaarin rivalry in the TIE Fighter game. Basically, the TIE Fighter game strongly implied that the Emperor was facing far more dangerous threats internally from his own military leaders than he faced from the Rebels. One rogue admiral, Harkov, defected to the Rebels and had to be put down by Vader. Another high ranking admiral (perhaps even Grand Admiral) Zaarin mounted a coup against the Emperor and had to be neutralized by Thrawn.

This expansion could give the Empire some very strong war machines (TIE Avengers, TIE Defenders, Assault Gunboats, and Missile Gunboats were all introduced as Zaarin's and Thrawn's designs during this civil war) and an elite new leader (Thrawn himself could be something like a 4 Space 1 Ground leader with extremely powerful Action Cards), but also force the Empire to hunt down rogue Imperial units.

UniverseInH,bucuresti,B,"&gt; Exact, DACA. Eu unul nu sunt dispus sa cred astfel de personaje sinistre (Udrea scoate un copil din ea in Costa Rica doar ca sa scape de inchisoare... WTF) pana nu isi demonstreaza afirmatiile intr-o instanta de judecata. Daca tu esti dispus, bravo tie, dar marturisesc ca nu te inteleg decat din punctul de vedere a unei credinte pe care o ai deja, ce iti este validata de Udrea si Ghita.

Ad hominem. 

&gt;Nu ar mai fi un singur vinovat in lumea asta daca judecatorii ar asculta doar pledoaria si versiudnea acuzatului. Nu reiese absolut nimic din ce zice aia acolo, decat ca aia e versiunea ei.

**Iti dai seama ca vorbesti despre un om nevinovat, nu?**

&gt;Achitari se intampla oriunde in lumea asta. Asta nu inseamna ca e un abuz sau orice altceva de genul asta, decat daca numarul acestor achitari devine foarte mare sau exista un sablon clar, demonstrat in instante. Ceea ce nu e valabil pt DNA, avand o medie a achitarilor / an sub cea europeana, in conditii mult mai nefavorabile (buget, restructuri din cauza hotararilor CCR si a legilor neclare, opozitie acerba din partea clasei politice, etc.).

Arata-mi o tara care are 12,2% pe an achitari.

&gt;Colaborarile cu SRI au fost legale (neloiale nu stiu ce inseamna in contextul asta???). Probele culese in acest mod au fost in continuare considerate valide de instantele de judecata. Decizia CCR nu e retroactiva si nu scoate DNAul in ilegalitate, ci pur si simplu clarifica ceva ce legiuitorul (Parlamentul) a lasat neclar. DNAul a lucrat pe legile existente, nu e treaba sa sa prevada ce interpretari va da CCRul pe legile in vigoare. Plus ca daca aveau din prima buget pentru propriul serviciu de urmarire, ar fi putut fi invinuiti ca nu-l au. Insa nu au avut asa ceva, de asta au fost nevoiti sa se bazeze pe expertiza SRI.

Nu au fost legale. Citeste ce a scris tipa judecator despre legalitatea inregistrarilor pe siguranta nationala:

*""Vorbind despre decizia CCR, nu credeti, stimati colegi, ca ar fi momentul sa ne intrebam fiecare de ce am acceptat ani de zile ca executarea mandatelor de supraveghere tehnica, care reprezinta evident un procedeu probatoriu, sa fie facuta de SRI, in conditiile in care art.13 din Legea 14/1992 le interzice expres sa faca acte de cercetare penala?""*

Citeste si ce a zis Girbovan despre colaborarea DNA - SRI si agentii din justitie.

&gt;Cat despre probe, chiar si in fragmentul din Cotidianul se arata clar ca inregistrarea exista, nu a fost falsificata. Kovesi a explicat in detaliu acest aspect: s-a gresit la transcrierea inregistrarii, au trebuit schimbate cateva cuvinte, insa proba in sine a existat si a fost in continuare acceptata ca valida de catre judecator. De aici si pana la abuz si nu mai stiu ce, cale lunga. Poate daca un procuror nu ar mai avea cate 80 de dosare in administrare ina celasi timp s-ar evita astfel de greseli, nu?

Citez din hotarare ""procesul verbal de transcriere este **falsificat**"". Adica acolo s-a comis o infractiune.

Nud e alta dar eu de fiecare data, si am facut asta de mult prea multe ori, cand am inceput sa verific un articol de pe Luju.ro, am ajuns la concluzia ca au prezentat doar o parte din poveste sau pur si simplu au spus neadevaruri, doar pentru a dramatiza o anumita stire.

wewiusladius4,,,"&gt;It says exactly that - reducing the number of guns reduces gun homicides/suicides as well as overall homicides/suicides. I quoted this for you elsewhere, but you ignored it. All of this is taken from the conclusion at the end of the document.

The only reduced numbers are gun suicides, however this does not reduce overall suicide rates as the vast majority of suicides are by non-gun means. If guns were significant enough in suicides there should have been a correlation with overall suicide rates and gun ownership. There was no such correlation. I never said there would be a substitution effect, I said the decrease in gun suicides would not significantly lower the overall suicide rates.

&gt;More gun homicides and suicides the more guns there are:

No, only gun suicides and gun homicides involving women. Total gun homicides (involving both genders) or gun homicides involving only men were NOT significant. Let me explain.

https://imgur.com/a/CfLQ0

See the p. values for ""with gun"" and ""with gun - men""? They are not significant.

In other words, countries with higher gun ownership did NOT have higher total gun homicide rates or gun homicides involving men. The only significant gun homicide observed was for women, however, women make up a tiny minority of gun homicides, thus they do not significantly impact the gun homicide rate.

Gun ownership =/= higher total gun homicides in Europe. The only effect observed was for gun suicides and gun homicides involving women only.

captchalove,,,"&gt;I should clarify that a long-standing myth promoted by Apartheid was that SA was largely empty and whites and blacks entered it together from opposite directions. In reality, black people settled in SA nearly 2,000 years ago and had long settled as far South-West as the Eastern Cape by the time of the first arrival of Europeans. The remaining land was hunting and grazing land for Bushman hunter-gatherers and Xhoi-Xhoi herders. Only liars claim that Europeans claimed unused land.

This isn't 100% right - the history behind this belief is a bit more nuanced than that. 

Until the 1960s, mainstream historians believed that blacks and whites came to South Africa at more or less the same time, and that whites were the first to live in the western half of the Cape region. (As far as I'm aware, nobody ever questioned that Khoi and San people are the original inhabitants of South Africa.) This notion was used by the National Party to justify white rule, but it did not originate from them, it simply reflected the best available evidence at the time.

Then, in the 1950s and 60s, the work of archaeologists and the discovery of radiocarbon dating led to mounting evidence that blacks were present in the northernmost part of South Africa by the 11th century, and reached the Kei River by the time the whites were in the Cape. The NP chose to disregard this discovery, as it didn't suit their political narrative. The second half of the statement, that whites are no less 'indigenous' to the Cape region than blacks, is still regarded as correct.",True,0,1519907954,,False,0,dv0g72i,False,t3_8143fx,True,t1_dv0ed7w,/r/worldnews/comments/8143fx/south_aftrican_parliament_votes_to_seize_land/dv0g72i/,1524699387,5,True,False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,public,

You're wrong pal. Wrong and stupid.

Also, there isn't anti-semitism in the Labour Party, it's a made up smear, and also Dianne Abbot isn't racist, as there is no such thing as reverse racism against white people.

Well, I'm Irish and my uncle was in the IRA, so I actually like a lot of what they did, especially Patrick Magee, down in Brighton in '84. Now that was spectacular.

However, if you asked anyone who was actually in the 'RA if they believed Jeremy Corbyn supported them, they would tell you of course not. He reached out for peace talks, in the open, with full scrutiny, unlike what Thatcher did behind closed doors.

So, the IRA smears won't work on me, because I know all about the IRA, and they had no backing or collaboration with Corbyn whatsoever. My uncle hadn't even heard of him until he became big in the news, and he was in the PIRA's Belfast Brigade.

OdeToLiberty,,,"&gt; I suppose your position is viable if you're also a tyrant and want to oppress your own people.

It's also viable if you want foreign nations to remain uninvolved in your domestic politics.

&gt; Countries surrounding China now are very happy with American global leadership

Of course they are. China seems to be set on expanding and reclaiming its former clay, tilting the balance of power in that tender region. People are always happier with the status quo.

&gt; countries in Eastern Europe are also very happy with American leadership (similar to Western Europe during the height of the Cold War).

Of course they are. The US provides security against Russia, a supposedly expansionist power hell-bent on world conquest and whatnot.

But this is not my point. My point was never that American leadership is unpopular, my point was that many would argue that China's authoritarianism is nothing to worry about because China generally steers clear of interfering in the domestic politics of foreign nations. These are two very different points, and I'm quite certain that you know that.

&gt; Your moral relativism is morally bankrupt

Well, that's all relative, isn't it?

&gt; If countries cannot exist without a totalitarian form of government then they shouldn't exist. Period.

Says who? Allow me to say it again: democracy and liberalism are traditionally western ideas. These western ideas do not work across the globe, no matter how much you believe these ideas to be the ideal makeup of a government. What right do you have to say that China shouldn't exist merely because they have not 'embraced' democracy? Authoritarian governments are occasionally necessary for stability and peace.

AnotherAvgAsshole,,,"Interestingly, in what would perhaps lend to your point. Violence doesn't have to be physical, and actuality of the same can be present through behavioural inhibitions. For the purpose of violence being restrictive or curbing in nature, any other actions which does the same could also possibly be termed as violence.


And if I understand what you intend to say, it's that such penal provisions are restrictive in nature. This is known as the [chilling effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_effect). If I know that there are some actions which are vague or whose consequences are over-broad such that the consequences are not proportionate to the supposed harm caused, it is in violation of one's right to free speech. One would in effect *chill* their own actions so that they wouldn't suffer consequences.


And in this seemingly predominantly liberal/left-leaning society, there is (what some would consider) a valid “fear” from the other side that their opinion is being cut down.


Now what I'm trying to get at, is that no right an unfettered right, even the right to free speech irrespective of it's core nature or fundamental aspect in the functioning of our democratic society. Some rights can be restricted in the interests of the rights of others. Like a call for violence if it has a proximate connection to the violence can be penalise. But you might obviously counter, that might be there, but this is merely speech that is offensive. And in fact, regarding this, the ECtHR (European Court of Human Rights) in the 70s held that speech cannot be restricted simply because it [offend, shocks or disturbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handyside_v_United_Kingdom). 
But what is also recognised regarding Continental Jurisprudence (and accepted/followed by IACtHR, AfCtHPR) is that some places have what is called a [Margin of Appreciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_of_appreciation). That is, governments are in a better position than the European Court of Human Rights, to determine the necessity of restricting certain actions considering the factual matrix of that region. That there might exist socio-political background/historical incidents that might have occurred in the past, therefore what might be acceptable in some places might not be acceptable otherwise.


Now obviously what has occurred is that the French Govt. is of the opinion that the right of certain individuals must be protected otherwise there could be some harm caused to individuals of certain communities or because of certain historical socio-political events that might have occurred.

Now to be frank, I will admit that I personally am not in favour of broad restrictive speech even ones that might supposedly offend individuals to a great degree. You can, if you choose to do so, refer to [Bakri vs Film Council (a decision by an Israeli Court)](https://globalfreedomofexpression.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bakri-v.-Israel-Film-Council_0.pdf) where even recognising the nature of speech it was found that govt's have very limited powers when it comes to restricting speech. (Note: This is in the thread of *offend, shock, disturb*, but it is a fascinating case regardless).


Anyway, I've digressed a lot, IDK if you'll even read all of this but i guess


**TL;DR** 


Yes, speech cannot be restricted merely because it offends, shocks or disturbs individuals. Otherwise, that would result in a chilling speech; it would curb artistic speech, result in only certain socio-political opinions being spread which is not really democratic.
But, it  can still be restricted to protect the rights of others.

baseballkrba_10,,,"This is actually an amazingly complex set of questions and I would be happy to help. I am a long time DM and I studied history in college. I am building an RPG and setting to better depict ancient and medieval Europe through more authentic use of history, culture, folklore, language, and geography. I would be happy to discuss with you some of the actual history as well as some things I have implemented which work for me and others which don't.

For starters, this will be your world. What you say goes. Whatever geography you want is totally acceptable. However, geography has major effects on history, demographics, and culture. If you are like me, you want people and cultures in your world to in some ways reflect the geography. For example, people shouldn't have wood houses in an area that doesn't have a lot of trees, like Greece. I always try and use the real world as much as I can for this. I imagine a geography I want to produce in an area of my world, then I look at real world maps and landscapes which depict that geography. What are people in that area wearing? What do they build their houses out of? Does that area have access to roads, the sea, or deep rivers? Overall, I would give very careful consideration to geography. Popular fantasy is dominated by Early Renaissance/Late Medieval England. I believe that setting is getting sort of stale, so lets break out of that. 

Now that geography is out of the way, lets consider who is living there. Lets start with the bottom up:

Houses and the household: Interior space is something we really take for granted in our modern era. We spend a vast majority of our time ""inside"". Pre-modern peoples, however, pretty much only went inside to sleep and escape bad weather. They probably didn't have much of a concept of ""inside"". For that reason, I try and think of medieval houses much more like we think of tents. A possible and interesting exception may be among the very wealthy. 

Houses came in many shapes and sizes depending on location. For ordinary people, they would be the cheapest materials in that location. In rocky, rugged, and dry Greece, they were made of rough stone and plaster, while in northern Europe you would see more wood and sod. Most of these houses would only be a few rooms which where shared by a multi-generational family. There wasn't much privacy and things would have been really cramped. 

Villages: Westward expansion in America made it so families would go out to their remote farms and build there houses in the middle of nowhere. This is NOT how Europe did it. You family probably couldn't survive very long on their own in the frontier. A band of raiders or army would see that as easy pickings. So in Europe, typical farmers lived in villages and walked a few miles to their farms in the morning and back home at night. As a result, the European countryside is dotted with webs of villages. A villager couldn't spend all day walking to his farmland, so I would imagine that the most distant cultivated land belonging to that village was between 5-10 miles. After leaving those most distant farmlands of a particular villages, you might run into forests or the neighboring village's farmlands. 

The Wilderness: The Romans and Greeks believed that it was mankind's destiny to bring civilization and order to a otherwise chaotic natural world. Romans actually had a religious boundary surrounding their towns called a pomerium which sort of separated law and order from nature and chaos. The point is, the wilderness was very often seen as a cold, dark, and dangerous place in European history. Its were monsters supposedly roam and bandits take shelter. As a result Europeans tended to cluster their villages together with forests around the villages and not between them. 

Towns: I wouldn't separated towns and villages by number of citizens, but by specialization of labor. In a village, a peasant sort of has to be a jack of all trades and master of none. They all have to till their own fields, care for their own animals, repair their own homes, fix their own tools, butcher their own meat, etc. Their probably wasn't much specialized labor in villages for a variety of reasons. Towns, on the other hand, could support craftsmen, and in my mind, that is what makes a town a town. There isn't enough work for a blacksmith in a village, but their is a town. And if a villager needs something which he cant make, he might walk from the village to the town. Whenever I place a town on the map, I try and think why it is a town and not just another village. Why did the town grow? Why could it support specialized labor? If a village is near a bridge, you would imagine more people passing through that village and you could imagine it becoming a town. Perhaps and area is exceptionally fertile and can support a more dense population.

Cities- Villages and towns would have been everywhere, but cities would be much more rare. It takes a lot of infrastructure for a city to form and survive. Rome, for example, couldn't feed itself. Italy, for that matter, couldn't feed the city of Rome at it height. The Romans had to import a vast majority of their grain from Sicily and Egypt. Athens got most of their grain from Greek colonies on the Black Sea. The point it, very specific things must align in order for a city to form. Usually, there needs to be a trade route or port very close by. Often cities were on major rivers or the coast. 

Honestly, I would write a lot more about this, but I already have a wall of text.

Treść mojego zdania była taka, że użycie słowa 'kwintesencja' w twoim zdaniu było bez sensu. 'Kwintesencja' oznacza albo piąty żywioł w kosmologii Arystotelesa, albo w sensie metaforycznym najistotniejsza cecha danej rzeczy. _G_ nie jest cechą, i nie użyłeś jej tak z resztą w zdaniu. Powiedziałeś, jakby to było coś namacalnego.

*Coś, czego nie zrozumiałeś. Lamarck (a zatem wczesny Spencer i jego normatywne stwierdzenia dot. społeczeństwa) jako pierwszy przyszedł mi do głowy, jako osoba która tłumaczyła fenomeny dziedziczne używając fałszywej, mieszającej  _nature and nurture_ metody.

Nie ma w moich odpiwiedziach ani nic intelektualnego, ani pseudointelektualnego; wydaję mi się, że używasz zwrotu do własnego braku zrozumienia jako wyłącznej podpory.

'Azali, gdy ktoś na internecie mówi coś, co ci się nie podoba, to jest nic innego niż ukryta, czychająca zawsze w zakamarkach _lewicowa propaganda_! Strzeż się, obywatelu!'

A ja na przykład widzę, że nie znalzłeś lepszego argumentu niż zawsze mocarnego 'nie rozumiem [lub nie chcę], więc ignoruję' oraz po prostu karykaturalnego _argumentum ad personam_ (nie obeszłoby się)..

Genotypy są dziedziczne, nie fenotypy. Słowo 'populacja' użyłem skrótowo tak, ja uważałem że masz na myśli- tzn. kliny kontynentalne- Europejczycy, Azjaci, Afrykanie, itd.- w praktyce tzw. 'biali, czarni, żółci'.

Nie wymienialiśmy się statystykami, więc ten wytrysk jest raczej nie pokolei. Jakoś wątpie, żebyś wytężał oczy za bardzo, czytając komenty, bo _sam stwierdziłem rację_ tych i analogicznych statystyk. Natomiast o konkluzje których chcesz, trzeba będzie trochę powalczyć- i to pod górkę, bo wbrew innym danym historycznym i naukowym.

Podaję ci zarówno fakty i argumentację, a ty tak boisz się ewentualnie przyznać mi rację, że mówisz 'bełkot'. Sorry.

I tutaj chciałbym powiedzieć, że jestem osobą raczej pobłażliwą, chętną do podjęcia, że ten, z kim rozmawiam również stara się przynajmniej argumentować na podstawie moich faktycznych stwierdzeń.

Przeczytaj całą nitkę jescze raz, jeśli musisz, ale stracha na wróble którego sobie podstawiłeś za mnie po prostu tu nie ma.

 /Czarno na białym: nie nigdy, nie twierdziłem wyższości lepianek (chociaż o zamku Fasylidesa, Wlk. Zimbabwe i Wlk. Meczetu w Djenné chciałoby się napomknąć) ani nad chatami Europy i jej pałacami, ani nad wybudowanymi przez jej cywilizacje (l. mnoga) bogactwa kulturowego, historycznego itd., którym jak zapewne wiesz, niewątpliwie sprzyjał poziomy, otoczony morzami, umiarkowany w klimacie i niespotykanie bogaty w zwierzęta hodowlane charakter geograficzny./

Jak mówiłem, myślisz, że konkluzja jest zawarta w przesłance. Nazywa się to 'argument z potwierdzenia konsekwencji' i jest to błąd logiczny. Wygląda tak:

(Niech: A =&gt; B)
Przesłanka: B
Zatem, A

W twoim przypadku, B to tzw. czarni mają obecnie statystycznie niższe IQ od białych; a A- w cokolwiek byś chciał wierzyć na temat pseudonauki i powodowania tego stanu rzeczy, tych warunków.

ShakaUVM,mod,Mod | Christian,"&gt;Were there Buddhist holy wars?

Yes

&gt;Was the violence condoned or initiated by the religion or committed by the religions followers. 

If ""by the religion"" you mean the leaders, then both.

&gt;If yes, Can you elaborate and site sources?  

There are many examples on Wikipedia: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism_and_violence

An easy cite is Stephen Turnbull's book on Warrior Monks in Japan: 
https://www.amazon.com/Japanese-Warrior-Monks-AD-949-1603/dp/1841765732

Pay especial attention to the sections where the Buddhist monasteries would use physical violence with the armed monks to pressure the emperor into doing things their way.

Despite Buddhism's reputation for being pacifistic, this more has to do with the poor quality of history education in the West than anything else.

It's akin to a history teacher in Nepal claiming that western European countries are peaceful because Jesus was a pacifist.

Marxists will tell you that it's merely a manmade law, and will carefully omit the fact that Manu gains his authority from the superhuman Vedas, the [Yajurveda (2.10)](http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/yv/yv02.htm) specifically which states:

The last straw being having a post I made not only removed from the main page but comments locked and no response from the moderators when I challenged them. I feel a bit of admiration for the WOC who push back against the rampant racism here, but also futility. I appreciate so much of this sub’s posts but the acknowledgement of how white feminists have contributed to white supremacy and the dehumanizing of WOC, which in part explains to me why so many WOC understand that however being a woman is defined the defining shouldn’t be the purview of white feminists and are open to examining other definitions, especially when current gender norms and roles have been forced on so many of us and historical cultural notions of gender have been subjugated by the colonizers which so many on this sub deny or dismiss.

Article:

&gt;U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Thursday he would impose tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum, in a move the administration said would protect U.S. industry, but which critics said would fail to boost jobs and risked stoking a trade war with China.

&gt; Trump, speaking after a meeting with U.S. steel and aluminum makers said the duties would be formally announced next week.

&gt; ""We're going to build our steel industry back and our aluminum industry back,"" he said.

&gt; News of the tariffs drove the stocks of U.S. domestic steel and aluminum makers sharply higher, but also hit sentiment on Wall Street due to the potential impact of higher costs on consumers.

&gt; The move, which came after what one person with direct knowledge of the discussions described as a night of ""Chaos"" in the White House due to frequent switching of positions in the administration, was sharply criticized by some senior Republican legislators.

&gt; ""Every time you do this, you get a retaliation. Agriculture is the number one target. I think this is terribly counterproductive for the agriculture economy,"" said Senator Pat Roberts, who chairs the chamber's agriculture committee.

&gt; China has already threatened to curb imports of U.S. soybeans in retaliation, while the European Union has said it will consider action as well.

&gt; China's top trade official Lui He is in Washington for trade talks.

&gt; AK Steel Holding was up almost 12 percent, U.S. Steel Corp was up 8 percent and Nucor rose 3.6 percent.

&gt; By contrast, industrial stocks such as Boeing fell, with traders citing tariffs, which would hit manufacturers' costs.

&gt; The administration says duties would protect U.S. industry, but critics say they would raise costs for industry and fail to deliver on a campaign pledge to boost domestic jobs.

&gt; It had appeared unlikely that Trump would announce the tariffs on Thursday after a night of back and forth inside the administration.

&gt; ""There was a lot of movement within the past 12, 16 hours,"" said the source who had knowledge of the discussions, but who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.

&gt; ""It was going to happen. It wasn't going to happen and then it did happen.""

&gt; The administration has also cited national security interests for its action, saying the United States needs domestic supply for its tanks and warships.

&gt; Contrary to the action announced by Trump on Thursday, the Department of Defense had recommended targeted steel tariffs and a delay in aluminum duties.

&gt; Although China only accounts for two percent of U.S. steel imports, its massive industry expansion has helped produce a global glut of steel that has driven down prices.

&gt; Trade tensions between the United States and China have risen since Trump took office in 2017 and the administration is also pushing on what it regards as forced technology transfers to China.

&gt; Shares of Asian steel producers such as South Korea's POSCO and Nippon Steel fell overnight.

&gt; FEW MORE JOBS FROM TARIFFS While American steelmakers have lost three quarters of their jobs between 1962 and 2005, a major study by the American Economic Association showed that much of this had been due to improved production technology as output per worker rose fivefold.

&gt; ""Thus, even if trade protection leads to increased domestic production, increases in employment may be far less than many hope,"" a report from the highly-regarded independent Econofact economist network said last week.

&gt; Consumers of steel and aluminum have lobbied hard against the tariffs.

&gt; Econofact said in its report that two million jobs were in industries that use steel ""Intensively"", including auto parts, household appliances, farm machinery and oil equipment.

&gt; Jobs in the consuming industries are concentrated in California, Texas, the Northeastern and Midwestern states that comprise the rust belt and states in the Southeast.

&gt; ""Across many states, the number of jobs adversely affected in these steel-using industries could far exceed any steel jobs saved,"" Econofact warned.

Europe is far left over all compared to the world and I would say that America leans a little left on the global stage of politics.   So it would make more sense to say that the 'right' is rare in Europe then it would be to say that 'left' is rare in America without referencing a specific political system.

&gt;So here’s the question, if the Hebrews were of dark tone, and Jews are forbidden to mix with non Jews, how did the skin tone end up white and with no appearance of middle eastern/African features?

I don't think this is true, many Ashkenazi carry features of the middle east. Features like black curly hair, large noses, etc are quite common in the middle east. Especially in the Levant. I think the idea that Ashkenazi Jews did not intermix with Europeans is preposterous. I am sure if any Ashkenazi Jew on this subreddit did a DNA test, they will show signs of European ancestry and this has been true in most studies. Although most are largely Jewish, they never are entirely Jewish genetically. Additionally, Judaism only requires that the mother be Jewish for the child to be Jewish. 

You might be surprised at how white the middle-east has been as well, people in the Levant can come off as quite light skinned as well.

Obviously there's going to be a lot of subjectivity about what constitutes a fear campaign, but when he literally says ""you should be frightened,"" I think I have a pretty good argument.

&gt; Corruption I feel is talked about a lot but proven very little, instead we have a clear european procurement policy and tax havens are battled, I've seen no clear signs that corruption is a problem or rampant within EU institutions

&gt; That can be your opinion, the number has grown, lobbying has become more prevalent, however lobbying in general has become much more prevalent 

&gt; Alignment with corporate interest is very far below American level, we are liberalizing trade to the international trade perspective but the EU is not catering to companies to any large extent

&gt;Increasing alignment with NATO and US, not so weird since Turkey has been more agesssive politically and Russia is engaged in information warfare. We have just found a way to state a shared external policy, imo one of the most important aspects of the EU, military and energy security 

&gt;Legislation process is difficult, but Member States eventually ratify nearly every piece of legislation itself, unless they have mandates the commission to. 

&gt; eroding social and humanitarian values... we are pretty much the most progressive and tolerant society these days, what are you comparing it to? Colonialism or the US 70's? Also national parties have gotten more right wing, not the EU, because of the migrant crisis. 

&gt; Expoloitation of NGOs, Front agencies, refugees. I don't really understand what form of exploitation you mean, can't comment. But refugees are not exploited, there is just not enough capacity to house them properly due to migrant crisis, not as much EU the organization as Member States

&gt; increasing surveillance.. GDPR is the most extensive protection of personal data in the world, about to be introduced, still number 1 progressive of all continents

&gt; All pieces are published, if you disagree write an academic paper on it

&gt; Yes, criminals have free movement too, just like every student and worker, so still not that bad

&gt;This one is not even an argument. It's called a customs union, US corporate governance is dangerous, this is just a states affair. Companies don't hold as much power as you think in the EU. Dire influences of Monsanto and Phillip Morris have been combatted, and the EU is quite cautious with the power of the tech giants.

A beautiful song by a unique Hungarian folk singer. I was a junior in high school, and I believe I heard it on ""Fresh Air"" after school one day, probably within a month or so of having discovered Dead Can Dance. My mom and I both thought it was Indian music, so it was especially shocking when the guitar came in and the whole thing suddenly sounded European, but still alien and unfamiliar. We hear sounds like this in TV and movies all the time now (I am still amazed that the Armenian duduk has become the primary signifier of ""eastern mystery""), but it was rare in 1993 to hear ""world music"" on daytime talk radio.

ziptofaf,,,"Well, domain names aren't exactly expensive in the first place. If you go with something regional/not-top-level then it can be as little as around 1-2€ per year. Eg. here's .ovh: 

https://www.ovh.co.uk/domains/dotovh.xml

Even decent domain names like .eu are sub 5€ a year nowadays. Buy it once and remember that all subdomains are free (so if you get a domain example.com then test.example.com, troll.example.com etc are all included in that), it will also be necessary for sending emails that won't get flagged as spam, it's also kinda the only way to RECEIVE emails as well. Meaning that domains are quite important if you are building a web application.  

Of course there ARE ways to not pay a cent but but they would only work for you and would trigger warnings and errors for everyone else. But if you are interested, there are following concepts you could look into (but it's only if you are doing it to learn how this stuff works, it makes no sense otherwise):

* firstly, domain names. How does you typing reddit.com lead you to 151.101.193.140 IP? Answer is - via DNS servers. Those are the ones translating domain names into addresses. Now, it IS possible to run your own DNS server. Then you can create any domain you wish (or even take an existing one and pretend to be google.com if you feel like it). This is actually often done in companies to create INTERNAL domain zones. So rather than remembering that our main server has an IP 192.168.1.99 you can just type main-server.example.com. This will only work from within a company however, not from the global internet. If you are interested in trying it out for some reason then look into [BIND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIND). 
* secondly, there's nothing stopping you from deploying your own HTTPS certificate. [Here's an example](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-ssl-certificate-on-apache-for-ubuntu-14-04). This would let you use HTTPS without having a domain name. To explain - the only difference between you signing your own HTTPS certificate and a company like DigiCert doing it for you is that your browser knows who DigiCert is and knows that their certs can be trusted. If you do it then it will complain that it's an untrusted certificate. It doesn't however mean it won't work. Eg. this is how my [home router address looks like](https://puu.sh/zyvC2/5adae5ed74.png) - and yes, it has HTTPS enabled. 

So if you are doing it just for the sake of testing then sure, you can spoof domain names and make your own certificates, no big deal. But with how cheap these things are nowadays (literally $2 per year for a domain and free certificates) it makes very little sense to go out of your way with such hacky solutions.

So the fact that America contributes the lions share of funds to a pact designed mainly to defend Europe is a bit odd. 

Just looking at the rest of the CNN link posted above, the next biggest spenders (as a percentage of GDP) is Greece which...is not exactly a wealthy nation these days.

newnewacct,Glenn,Metacanadian,"I've posted elsewhere, long explanations of why our exports are so reliant on the US. 

We have one warm water port. ONE in Vancouver that we can ship goods out of year round. We have the St. Laurence the other part of the year running as well. We obviously have way more exports than that, so we ship a shitload of stuff through the US to the Gulf of Mexico, to get shipped around the world.

If the US wants to put a tariff on Canadian goods, not only would everything we export to the US be hit with a tariff, but so would anything we ship to Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and some of Asia (depends on capacity in Vancouver).

As much as people want to pretend Canada doesn't need the US, we'd be fucked without them, and with no free trade deal they'd lose 8% of their GDP, while we'd be reduced to a borderline developing nation. Imagine if we lost upwards of 30% of our GDP.

""We'll trade with a different country!""

We literally can not trade with another country without going through US territory. Our ports are already maxed out, and our rail infrastructure is specifically designed to go down to Chicago, and then to various US ports. 

If we wanted to be self reliant after getting a massive GDP hit, it would take 100's of billions (if not trillions) of dollars to rearrange our rail infrastructure, build a new highway structure, build new ports, which would take decades.

All the while our GDP has been but by 25% +, so we have no fucking money, and we now have a barrier to entry in the largest marketplace in the world, which just so happens to be right next door, and the whole reason we're so prosperous.

There's zero reason why we shouldn't have a mutually beneficial relationship with the US when it comes to trade and economics, and it's time to tweak NAFTA. Canada could even get some things in there that benefited our country. Let them bring their dairy, concede a bit on softwood lumber, and get them to get rid of their corn subsidy. 

Please let them bring their wireless carriers to Canada. I'd love a $20 phone plan.

Caridor,,"Anyone but May, anyone but May","&gt;But you're telling them there is a relationship between the abuse and being Muslim? Am I understanding you right?

No, quite literally the opposite. The initial comment on this thread was saying how we don't have data to say that. Look, I won't say I understand the anguish these people went through because I haven't experienced anything like it but I can imagine that they'd want to blame someone, anyone for the things that happened to their children. That's just human nature. They'll be angry and immeasurably sad at the same time and perhaps not thinking clearly but still, I could not lie to them and confirm what we don't know to be true. 

&gt;But there are sizeable Muslim communities that explicitly do not want to mix, integrate or assimilate. It's a doctrinal and cultural thing.

But there are Muslim communities that do. Let's start with them. Also, over time people can have their barriers broken down. They may not integrate at first but the first step can be something as simple as the guy at KFC saying ""Oh hi, do you want the usual then?"". 

&gt;I think we already see what happens.

I think we're seeing first stage of what happens. It's a process. It takes time. 

&gt;Isn't that a bit dystopian?

What? A world in which war and boundaries are gone? I don't think so. Perhaps it's a fairy tale but to others, it's an ideal and a goal. A goal which I believe we can reach. Human history has been a long history of humans coming together to form greater and greater unions. First you had tribes, then groups of villages to form the first tiny nations and skip ahead a few thousand years and we have a nearly united Europe and unions like the UN. Surely a global union is only a few steps further on that evolution?

&gt;That makes you sound ambivalent about it

To be frank, I am. A war between global super powers would end the world pretty quick, so it's either a happy future, the status quo for the rest of my life or a blinding flash followed by whatever awaits beyond the grave.

AVOID! In my experience these guys just find something that grows like crazy and stick a bunch of it in. Usually turns out to be something invasive. I've seen people with European buckthorn hedges....

When dealing with drainage $1000 won't get you very far for something on this scale. My suggestion for diverting water would be to terrace the slope to direct the flow of water, using steps to get from one to the next. Ultimately directing the water to a part of the yard you don't mind flooding. However this is something that has to be done right or it becomes dangerous. Alternatively, you could try to alter the grading on the hill and bottom so that water goes somewhere unimportant. 

As for cutting less grass, it's the same situation. You could put in groundcovers, but then you have to remove the sod, dispose of it, buy plants, buy mulch, etc. Plants are not cheap, and mulch adds up too. If you were to just plant a bunch of fast-growing shrubs, I feel that they would just get overgrown and things would look worse.

All in all, this is a tough situation. Low budget and large area makes fixing things difficult.",True,0,1519945225,,False,0,dv1in9g,False,t3_817leh,True,t3_817leh,/r/landscaping/comments/817leh/need_ideas/dv1in9g/,1524718218,3,True,False,landscaping,t5_2qndi,public,

LikesMoonPies,,,"&gt; Russia's military budget is 70 billion, and china's is 131 billion. Meanwhile, the US military is at 597 billion and the EU budget totals at 226.7 billion. Looking at spending alone, neither Russia nor China wouldn't stand a chance making a move against most Europe, nevertheless the US.

&gt; Xi Jinping and Putin are dangerous, no doubt, but we don't need to be spending 4 times as much as them just to act as a deterrent   

While this seems logical, it is not, and, is a very dangerous way of thinking that seems to be becoming more widespread.  

You can't compare dollars in a meaningful way like this.  For example, a huge difference is wages.  The USA has a much higher COL than either Russia or China and also depends on a entirely volunteer military.  

The USA [pays about 10 times higher wages than China](http://english.chinamil.com.cn/news-channels/china-military-news/2015-01/19/content_6314553.htm) and [as much as 4 times higher wages than Russia.](https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2012-02-01/a-significant-pay-increase-russian-army)    

You could knock $100 - $150 billion off the US budget for that, alone, if we dropped wages on our service members.  

Also, our weapons and warplanes, and warships and submarines are made by US contractors who are also paying US wages which accounts for billions more.    

The EU is not as prepared as you think either.  For example, [the UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_active_United_Kingdom_military_aircraft) and [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Air_Force) combined have ~400 combat jets, while Russia alone has [over 1000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_active_Russian_military_aircraft), not counting those of its allies. 

European nations rely on the US to for training and also help. One of the supposed military powerhouses of the EU, the UK, [had to call in the US 11 times, even after calling for help from France and Canada, in 2015](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/royal-navy-relied-on-nato-to-protect-british-waters-20-times-in-2015-a6870686.html) to send maritime patrol/anti-submarine aircraft to find a Russian sub detected in their own waters, because they had retired their own aircraft years earlier to save money and didn't have money to replace it.

There are obvious advantages over potions - spellcasting is instantaneous and doesn't require specific ingredients.

A second referendum too is to disregard the first vote - which again is undemocratic. (regardless of how democratic the vote is or, indeed, the outcome)

I'm in two minds about the vote on the final decision as we've seen today that the EU STILL wants to dictate to us how this should pan out and it's only going to be okay if it's in their favor. People need to remember that the when the UK joined the EU it was a trade agreement. Not a method for unelected bureaucrats to dictate the the UK how to conduct its business (figuratively speaking). The fact that there are members of parliament who are campaigning to remain in the EU (some in direct contradiction to the vote from their constituencies shows how 'Stockholm' things have become IMHO) is grossly undemocratic.

displaced_martian,,,"My personal position is that it is naive to expect other nations or the USA to attempt to not influence the internal politics of other democracies (or dictatorships) to the benefit of that state.  A statement by the PM of the UK or Israel that they prefer one candidate over another is intentionally influencing the American democratic process.  Any international political action is attempt to sway the policy of other states to your states benefit. 

Transparent actions can be linked by the public and the source of information/position/motivations is readily apparent.  The EU imposing sanctions in response to damages against their own industries will have a political impact.  That impact can be broad or targeted.   The EU choose to impose targeted tariffs.  Targeted tariffs on the political groups who may not realize how they benefit from free trade (ie vote for politicians with protectionist policies).

To me, the important piece is that the influence is transparent.  If the Russian agents had registered as such and acted in accordance with the laws governing foreign government agents, then there would be many fewer issues.  There most certainly would be questions, but those questions would have ready answers.  Russia benefits from a divided and inept US.  Transparency does not work for this objective, historically it would have resulted in the opposite.

To you, it maybe that any attempt to influence a democratic process should be held equally bad.  I do not see how in the modern connected world it is possible for other states to not react to democracies by influencing their populations.

usrname42,economist chetty image mod red-border external pink text,Last night I dreamt I went to Mendeley again,"&gt;This deficit is a serious drain on demand, and does not stem from a strong economy pushing its limits. And with the Federal Reserve Board pushing interest rates down to zero, it had limited capacity to boost demand.

Rates aren't at zero any more, and if reducing the trade deficit did increase demand we'd expect the Fed to raise interest rates faster to offset that effect - if the Fed thinks that the economy is well below capacity at the moment, they wouldn't have increased interest rates already.

&gt;What effect does all this have on American workers? Trade deficits, even in times of strong growth, have negative, concentrated impacts on the quantity and quality of jobs in parts of the country where manufacturing employment diminishes. Even the economists who argue (incorrectly, we believe) that the trade deficit doesn’t affect the total number of jobs do admit that it affects the composition of jobs. There is, for example, a lot of research confirming that deindustrialization in the Rust Belt is partly a result of the fact that America meets its domestic demand for manufactured goods by importing more than it exports. One oft-cited academic study found that imbalanced trade with China led to the loss of more than 2 million U.S. jobs between 1991 and 2011, about half of which were in manufacturing (which worked out to 17 percent of manufacturing jobs overall during that time).

*Trade* certainly affects the composition of jobs, but why would trade *deficits* alter the effect? Would the China shock somehow have had less impact on rust belt manufacturing if other people in the US were, say, exporting a lot of services to Europe, so the overall trade deficit was balanced?

ajehals,UKGB,Royaume-Uni de Grande-Bretagne et d'Irlande du Nord,"&gt; I think that London knows perfectly well that Brussels isn't going to back down and will boot the RoI out of the customs union (and thus EU) before accepting that. Which makes Brussels take the heat for making Ireland do border enforcement.

There is no way the EU is going to boot Ireland out of the customs union, or the EU, nor is Ireland going to allow a hard border.

The sane and frankly still most likely solution is that the UK and Ireland are going to find a mutually acceptable way of managing cross border traffic in goods and customs.  After all, you don't need to do customs checks at the border (you can do it at entry ports, and ad hoc in country) with most of the enforcement done not by customs officers looking at trucks, but by people looking at freight patterns, and documentation, with the odd spot check at logistics hubs and at the roadside (As you see in other parts of the EU at times).

There isn't going to be a hard border in Ireland, the UK doesn't want it, nor does Ireland, and at the end of the day, there are enough viable workarounds that it'd be easier for the EU to accept a technical solution, even if it isn't a great one, than do anything else.

A defesa de Macarrão conseguiu junto ao Tribunal de Justiça de Minas Gerais (TJMG) a progressão do cumprimento de pena no regime semiaberto para o aberto nesta quinta-feira e, consequentemente, foi expedido o alvará de soltura. A progressão da pena foi concedida pelo juiz Antônio Fortes de Pádua Neto, que considerou que Luiz Henrique Ferreira Romão já possuía os requisitos necessários, como cumprimento de tempo no semiaberto e bom comportamento. Ao G1, a advogada de Macarrão, Fabiana Cecília Alves, disse que o cliente vai permanecer em Pará de Minas e quer pagar pelo crime que cometeu. Em 23 de novembro de 2012, o amigo do goleiro Bruno Fernandes foi condenado a 15 anos em regime fechado por homicídio triplamente qualificado – motivo torpe, asfixia e uso de recurso que dificultou a defesa da vítima, a modelo Eliza Samudio – e mais três anos em regime aberto por sequestro e cárcere privado. Ele estava na Penitenciária Nelson Hungria, em Contagem, mas o complexo não aceitava o regime semiaberto, por isso a defesa do preso pediu a transferência para a cidade do interior, na ocasião. Ele foi sentenciado a 22 anos e três meses de prisão pela morte e ocultação do cadáver de Eliza, além do sequestro do filho da jovem.

CFSohard,chf,Canadese in Svizzera - 24 Paese,"Expect Venice to be packed with tourists to the point that walking along the main streets is next to impossible without running into 14 tour busses of people. I highly recommend the side streets.

As for fall activities, there really aren't any comparable to the eastern seaboard, as Venice is located ON water, it's literally stone and water, there's no trees to pick apples from or see the colorful leaves. 

Halloween has a very minor bit of attention, but it's essentially ignored in Europe.

As for Paris, it's a massive city, so I would imagine it would be similar to celebrating the fall in downtown Boston, except many times the size. The surrounding countryside won't be as colorful as the northeast US, but there will be plenty of apple orchards if you look in the right places. Expect to spend a good amount of time on a train getting out to the countryside if you are staying in the city center, as Paris is MASSIVE.

I can't personally attest to fall activities in either place, as I've only visited at other times of the year, but here in Switzerland we have lots of wine harvesting festivals, so you may find some of those. If you want the 'harvest festival' type culture, you'll need to leave the cities for sure, as Venice and Paris are both too large and metropolitan. Otherwise there's plenty to do in the cities themselves, but not much particularly related to fall that I can think of.",True,0,1519956226,,False,0,dv1szwo,False,t3_8190o6,True,t3_8190o6,/r/travel/comments/8190o6/fall_in_france_and_italy_versus_the_united_states/dv1szwo/,1524723194,2,True,False,travel,t5_2qh41,public,

SayNoob,,,"Here is what **Trump hopes will happen:** Canadian steel becomes more expensive in the US, thus the demand for American steel grows, reviving the US steel industry. As an added bonus, Chinese steel industry suffers because they export steel to Canada which then exports it to the US. 

Here is what will **actually happen**. The US steel industry is not capable of meeting the rising demand, so in the short term Canadian steel will still be used but it simply costs more, meaning industries that rely on steel will suffer huge amounts of layoffs and other cost saving measures to make up for the added costs of steel. The EU will file a grievance with the WTO and impose sanctions on US industries which will hurt the economy and destroy the Republican party's election chances.

Going fascist asap and grabbing up as much territory as possible from China during it's war with Japan. Once you build up both new and old territory, you have two choices: 
1. Help Japan win it's war in the east. Japan currently usually joins the Axis, putting you at odds with the Allies. If luck is on your side, you can nab French indochina with ease, giving you precious space to build industry. Your left flank, however, will be much harder. The war with india will be a slog, and while you will probably not make much progress, neither will they if your troops are strong enough and you've properly dug into position.
At this point, it's time to try and get some troops to Europe and paradrop into the U.K.
And that's it, war over. Take as much as you want and proclaim the Siamese Empire with your Axis brethren.
2. Once the war with china is over, it's backstabbing time. Again, your victory relies on paratroopers, as you will never ever get navel dominance against any of the majors. Declare on Japan once you've built up enough to defend your new assets, and drop close to a port city. If you're lucky, you'll manage to take out it's garrison, enabling you to send out the rest of the troops to seize the rest of the islands. If you do this fast enough, the Japanese ai will not react in time to stop your conquering of the islands. If you manage to take out Japan, congrats!

sotonohito,texas-flag,Texas,"&gt; Okay, and...? What's supposed to happen after that?

Then the US is basically out of the picture geopolitically and Russia can act without needing to worry (much) about US interference.

What Putin is mostly after is a free(er) hand. He wants to expand his borders, take over and strongarm the nations that he permits to continue on his border, reabsorb some of the republics that spun off from the USSR that have resources he thinks are worth the trouble, and expand Russia's economy which pretty much exists only as petroleum exports.

The US is potentially an impediment to all that.

Obviously his preference would be for the USA to be his puppet. That's not going to happen anytime soon, if at all. But the US being unable to act internationally due to internal conflicts, its world standing and reputation decaying, and so on is something he thinks he can achieve. Then all he's got to worry about are China and the EU, and those are more manageable if the US has removed itself from the picture via chaos and Trump.

Also, never forget that Putin is an old KGB man, from an era when attempting to exploit white America's racism was really popular in KGB circles. People don't change much after 20, and it seems likely that Putin still thinks a divided USA (ideally divided via racism) is a good policy.

Chaos for its own sake isn't Putin's goal. Chaos for the sake of crippling the USA and allowing him to do what he wants is. Also, I suspect he just doesn't much like the idea of democracy and likes anything that helps undermine it.

VENTDEV,,,"I'm assuming a year 1900 start, Base City Maps, with full AI.

&amp;nbsp;

Focus on North Eastern USA or Western Europe.  You don't have to start in a major city like New York or London, but be close to them. 


&amp;nbsp;


Since you have low starting funds, you'll probably want to avoid wasting a lot of money in component development. So you have two choices to get parts without paying development costs. You can either License the designs and build them your self (automatically when you build the vehicles). Or you can purchase already built units (you get an added bonus to how many vehicles can be made per production line).  


&amp;nbsp;


Since demand is more of a problem than production in early years, I would lean toward licensing components. RnD-&gt;Outsourcing-&gt;License Radio Box-&gt;Change company filter to All.


&amp;nbsp;



Check the reports for the popular body type for the region you're starting in (Reports-&gt;Reports 1-&gt;Body/Fuel Type Demand). If you can find a licensed vehicle design for a popular vehicle type, get it. You can immediately start producing it. Otherwise nab a Chassis/Gearbox/Engine and work on the most popular vehicle type for the area. NA it's normally trucks. EU it's generally Sedans in early years.


&amp;nbsp;



You don't need to build the best vehicle. You don't need to build the cheapest vehicle. But it does have to be affordable. In 1900 that typically means under $1,000 unit costs, and selling it for under $2,000 (in NA/Western EU).


&amp;nbsp;



When you're in the production phase, don't under estimate expansion. If you excess production capacity, try increasing demand by building a new branch in cities with more than 1,000,000 people in them before trying to cut prices (and margins). Alternatively, if you don't have enough factory lines, don't hesitate to increase prices if you're losing a lot of possible sales.


&amp;nbsp;



Always use the Bond system early. Creditors are not stupid. They will not invest in a company that is about to go bankrupt.


&amp;nbsp;



A lot of money can be made in the stock market. Look for companies with positive EPS. Means they're making a profit through sales and not increasing their market cap through debt (cough, Tesla, cough).


&amp;nbsp;



If you need more help, throw me an email, PM, whatever, with more details or even your save game and I can give you pointers. Alternatively, I can put together a profitable save game for the first 2-3 years for you and you can look at the structure of the company.",True,0,1519962066,,False,0,dv1ydo2,False,t3_815l89,False,t1_dv1qwy5,/r/tycoon/comments/815l89/looking_for_more_management_focused_games_like/dv1ydo2/,1524725778,4,True,False,tycoon,t5_2t8iw,public,

Clausewitz1996,novice,Novice,"&gt; Besides, Social science isn't ""hard science"" so anyone can comment on it.

Anyone can comment on a ""hard science"", too. It doesn't make them right. 

To be honest, I've never seen a physicist or chemist or biologist provide *useful* commentary on the nuances of post-Soviet democratization in Eastern Europe or offer cogent advice on labor policy. I've seen them offer soundbites on contentious social issues that have less to do with social science and more with political philosophy, though. Edit: With the exception of a few examples, like Sam Harris--who will actually break down statistical models when talking about social science issues like casualty figures in Iraq--the vast majority of scientists who talk politics are doing so from a philosophical lens. They don't go into the nitty gritty of p-values or sampling methods. They don't cite research in the relevant fields, either. Which is fine--most of us (myself included) rarely bring up academic research when debating policy. However, it really is incorrect to imply we're making comments on issues in social science when we don't actually understand society from a (soft) scientific perspective.

By the way, since when has advanced statistical analysis been commentary? Anyone who boils social science down to mere commentary only interacts with those fields through the opinion page. Roland Fryer's work on police shootings and Ian Bremmer's J-curve are both meticulously researched, sound bodies of work that extend beyond the realm of commentary. 

Also, chemistry and biology are far removed from each other in science? Chemists and biologists conduct collaborative research all the time, especially in the field of medicine.

Din 1990 pana azi am colaborat ca voluntar (neplatit), in secret ca dirijor, compozitor cu cei mai mari muzicieni ai planetei. Astfel incat pe toata planeta, in toate tarile primele (cele mai renumite, premiate  sau importante) dintre toate hiturile muzicale de top internationale, dintre melodiile laureate cu premiile cele mai renumite si premiul intii (si dintre primele locuri la premii), dintre primele 200 hituri din toate topurile si clasamentele muzicale internationale, dintre concertele cele mai renumite, dintre melodiile cele mai renumite, dintre melodiile de la premiile Eurovision, Oscar, Globul de Aur, dintre concertele, festivalurile, concursurile, melodiile cele mai renumite (de muzica simfonica, electronica, populara, usoara, disco si dintre toate genurile muzicale corecte, sanatoase) sunt  compuse si dirijate de mine. Am facut aceasta inclusiv de la distanta sau in trecut asemeni unui inger. Dar melodiile mele au fost semnate de alti muzicieni. Printre aceste melodii, concerte, melodii din spectacole, opere muzicale compuse, dirijate de mine sunt primele dintre melodiile internationale de succes, de top sau premiate de la radio si televiziuni, internet, muzica filmelor premiata cu Oscar, Globul de Aur si cu premii renumite sau din filmele cele mai renumite inclusiv din filmele Titanic (Oscar)si Gladiatorul (de Oscar), muzica spectacolului Lord of the Dance, muzica lui Luciano Pavarotti, Andreea Boccelli, Angela Gheorghiu, Hose Carreras, Placido Domingo, Enya, Celine Dion, Jean Michel Jarre, Astor Piazzola, Ennio Moricone, muzica celebra, sanatoasa, corecta a majoritatii celor mai mari vedete muzicale, compozitori, artisti de pe glob, cele mai renumite melodii si concerte din toate genurile muzicale corecte, in zeci de mii de melodii. Sunt cel mai iubit muzician de pe planeta din toate timpurile deoarece muzica mea are numarul cel mai mare de fani si de hituri, succese,  de albume vandute. Sunt intr-un cuvant compozitorul si dirijorul a toata muzica de varf, de hit, de succes, de renume a planetei. Cu Celine Dion am vandut muzica mea in cele mai multe albume dintre toti muzicienii, peste 100 milioane. Muzica mea a fost premiata cu locul 1 de cateva ori la  concursul Eurovision, la premiile Oscar, Globul de Aur. Am facut in secret multe altele de renume pe glob, premiate in fiecare din cele 7 arte si in muzica, regie de film dar nu doresc sa ma laud niciodata ci sa prezint cv-ul meu artistic.

RUSayingBooOrBooURNS,,,"&gt; When things can be checked by paper trail, I'd say we're in a pretty good position to spot bullshit.


And bullshit gets spotted all the time.  In ALL these companies.  As I'm sure you know, the internet is awash in forum posts--including right here in this subreddit, on an almost daily basis--by users expressing shock and confusion that their DNA ethnicity tests don't reflect their family's known, documented history.  It's not an isolated problem.


More to the larger point:  The fact that different companies frequently give wildly variant geogenetic analyses to customers should raise serious red flags, scientifically speaking.  The fact that they sometimes use different versions of the Illumina chip, and nearly always sample different SNP arrays and use different reference populations, is clear enough indication that one (or both) of two things is happening:


1.  There's no established and recognized corpus of data to support one company's methodology over the others'; and/or


2.  Each company is out to **sell a product** (which is trivially true), and is playing fast and loose with the science.


I'm convinced that both are true.  What these companies are hawking is Science Lite^tm.  A cheap, Walmart version of population genetics that dazzles the eye and tickles the self-identity fancy.


You asked me for some evidence of what I'm saying.  The source that comes most readily to mind is:


Leslie, et al.  2015.  The fine-scale genetic structure of the British population.  *Nature* 519.


(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4632200/)


The TLDR is that Leslie and colleagues had to use a very advanced genome analysis tool--*one not used by DNA testing companies AT ALL*--to find slight variations between native British people and those throughout mainland Europe.


Some relevant quotes (emphasis mine):


""Human population structure is **reasonably well** understood at **broad scales, for example between and within continents**. Here we investigate structure over much finer scales ...""


""To ensure compatibility between the [People of the British Isles] and continental European samples we restricted attention to autosomal SNPs genotyped in both samples (**~500K SNPs**, see Methods).""  (In other words, they used a regionally variant SNP set that is mostly on the same size order as that of the testing companies'.)


""Consistent with earlier studies of the UK, population structure within the PoBI collection **is very limited**.""


 
""Against this background of very limited structure within the UK, we applied a **recently developed method for detecting fine-scale population structure, fineSTRUCTURE15**, to the PoBI samples, to look for more subtle effects. [...] In contrast to commonly used approaches such as principal components or ADMIXTURE16, fineSTRUCTURE explicitly models the correlation between nearby SNPs, and uses extended multi-marker haplotypes throughout the genome. This substantially increases its power to detect subtle levels of genetic differentiation.""


""Note that it is possible for distinct clusters within the UK to have **very similar ancestry profiles**: e.g. two UK regions could receive similar contributions from a set of European groups (thus similar ancestry profiles) but then evolve separately (leading to different patterns of shared ancestry within and between the regions, and thus to distinct clusters in fineSTRUCTURE).""  (In other words, shared genetic clustering in Great Britain isn't necessarily indicative of specific continenal ancestry.)

...


Anyway, you get the idea.  Bottom line, to be able to tease out the internal British genetic clusters and contrast them to European clusters, Leslie **HAD** to use a state-of-the-art tool that's just not commercially available at retail prices for consumers.  The article is worth reading carefully, in full.

HiddenGun,LGfh2,,"&gt;  Survive is still ultimately harmless, far as I'm concerned.

That depends on what you mean by harmless. Some people just flat out don't buy games with micro transactions because, to them, even buying a game with mtx is supporting that model even if you don't buy anything simply because it's telling publishers ""We'll still buy it"" that and adding mtx is honestly trivial so that adding it doesnt really take away from developing meaning They'll just keep adding it for the potential of a few sales. To them MGSurivive's more radical push towards mtx is something they wouldn't want to support, and may view that it will be harmful for the games industry on a consumer level. Hell we're in a post BF2 world where lootboxes and mtx might be getting legislated. Anyway it depends on how that person feels.

&gt; So by all accounts, if we never got another Metal Gear game again, would it really be ""gone too soon?"" By all accounts, no, it wouldn't. Twenty eight years is enough, most would say.

Im inclined to agree with you. Games, and shows often get worse the more we get. Especially if the game is story driven within one continuity. It's one reason why FF has continued. Outside of some small connections they're all independent of each other allowing the game to take different twists and turns. 
&gt; 
&gt; MGS1 basically rewrites the first two Metal Gear games, because this wasn't a story meant to be made into a saga, hence its' terribly inconsistent continuity. And yet, it still reached its' end.

Ehhh the only thing I remember it changing was Grey Fox's ""death"" in MG2 for the most part, based on memory, those games don't get mentioned too much outside of Big Boss, Grey Fox, and the idea of Outer Heaven I believe. I could be remembering however. 
&gt; 
&gt; If it was Survive over ""Metal Gear: The Remake,"" or ""Metal Gear Solid 6: This Time, You're Really Big Boss, We Swear!,"" then, sure, it'd be very easy to understand the outrage. Heck, if a Metal Gear 1 remake was scrapped in favor of Survive, I'd probably be saying, ""fuck this game"" out of pure principle.
&gt; 
&gt; But that wasn't the case.

Yeah, but here's the thing. How many people wanted MGSurvive and how many people wanted the MSX/PS games remade in the Fox Engine. Hell one of the things after MGSV launched was people wanted Konami to remake those games. Instead, based on sales, and I know some people are simply not buying it because of Konami, We got a game that just simply only exists to follow old design trends. Is it still a fun game? yeah, but it's clearly trying to follow a trend here. Konami also knows people want a remake, people also want a port of the HD collection + 4 but I digress. Look at the FF7 Remake and all the attention that got it could have been a gesture of good will and having the next game after the Konami break up be a remake, most likely a damn good one, would soften the public to more MGS games from Konami. I'm convinced had survive been made after a good remake the negative press would be far less, although the criticisms would still be there. Anyway this of course doesn't counter your point since theres no real information, outside of sales but even that's somewhat unreliable but this more of a ""Think about it like this"" sorta deal"" if that makes sense. 

&gt; People can view Survive as cynical, mediocre, a cash grab all they want, and if that's how they feel, then that's fine! We all have opinions, and we'll all view things very differently, there's nothing wrong with that. But whatever you wanna call it, that still don't change the fact that its' existence doesn't hurt anything, not even Metal Gear.

It's existence? no but supporting it could hurt other things. Namely the business practices of other Konami games. But I touched on that on my first point. 

&gt; To go off of gameranx's point about Survive's hollow nature and microtransactions, I'd counter by saying where was any of this outrage ten years ago when MGO2 came out? I've seen people say that it came free with MGS4, but it didn't really. Its' basic starter pack came free with MGS4. Five maps; U.U., M.M., B.B., A.A., G.G., came free. But to play Survival? You'd need an expansion pack. To play with everyone else on all the ten additional levels and to get some new gear, you'd need to buy all the expansion packs. In order to play as a different character, you'd have to either delete your preexisting one with all the stuff you've earned and XP, or just purchase a second one for $6.99. And you could purchase upwards of seven additional characters. I know because I did for video purposes and nothing else. (I'm old, and I'm okay spending money for making short videos.)

MGO2 wasn't a standalone game, in the Americas and EU  at least, it was in Japan, so for 60 dollars we got the main story of the game, arguably what most people wanted, and than the online which grew to have a cult following. Now the reason why I feel like the outrage wasn't there is that it simply wasn't the main star of the show. It was there and it was good. But compare MGO2 to MGSurvive. Everyone was focused on the story and people simply ignored the MP after the first initial review, and some stories when the expansions came out. Paying for a character was dumb, the DLC was fine since it was just standard DLC, similar to the CoD Map packs. codecs were kinda dumb but again none of this was held under ""Survive coins"" or ""MB coins"" it was dumb but it was just considered cheap dlc. This was also 2008 in which DLC didn't spiral out of control and so naturally reception is gonna be different in 2018. We've seen how perverted the idea of DLC has became but in 2008 it was just ""eh kinda cool"" it's kinda unfair to compare the reactions of a 2008 audience to a 2018 audience especially in a field that develops as quickly as this. Eventually the Gene, Meme and Scene DLC was sold for like 20 dollars, a good price when you consider what a CoD mappack got you. This is also ignoring that MGO2 did feel unique from the other shooters. It has that metal gear feel even when the meta evolved to HS only. You could still sneak, and use cardboard boxes to try and get the drop on your enemy. Than agian I am also very biased towards MGO2 so you can ignore my last couple of sentences. 

Side note: did you end up making any MGO2 Machinmas? Those were honestly pretty great.
&gt; And then what happened? MGO2 shut down four years later, despite there being a planned fourth expansion pack which never happened; even if the maps were revealed, and odds are good, the uniques probably would've been Big Boss and Big Mama. (that last part is entirely conjecture, but the three additional maps that never made it into SENSE are on YouTube.) And despite the fact that the servers supposedly had a ten year plan. No matter how much money you spent on characters, DLC, radio packs, or whatever, all that money went down the drain. It wasn't just we paid $65 for MGS4 and MGO2, and eventually were just left with MGS4. We paid $65 for MGS4 and the starter pack for MGO2, and some of us paid a lot more for the full MGO2 experience, and ultimately, it was a rental with an expiration date.
Oh thank christ I'm not the only one who remembers that ""10 year plan"" I've looked for that article or piece of media do you happen to remember where that was said? Cause Google doesn't wanna help. I do agree that MGO2 closing, after 4 years, was absurd. Sure it didn't have the best numbers but it was still sizable given the fact it was a niche online game. At least it's back now. And yeah those Maps were added to the MGO2 Arcade game iirc. It was released only in japan and had The Arsenal Gear zone, Act 5. Also alot of games that have added online componetns get shut down. Now unless it's a game like CoD where it's primarily Multiplayer I don't feel my MGS4 disc lost value when the servers went under. THis is gonna be true of more and more MP games it's just the nature of how the game was programmed. If there was a backup where it didn't need to access Servers, matchmaking or otherwise, it would be good but publishers don't really think about preservation of media.
&gt; And yet, there was zero outrage for MGO2. None whatsoever. It was every bit a ""cash grab"" as Survive is, and yet, people loved it and praised it. It never received an ounce of criticism for its' microtransactions, despite most gaming sites seeming to be completely indifferent towards its' exisetence. 

But you didn't buy MGO2 standalone. This comparison would be better if Survive came with MGSV as the online version.  But you're not wrong in saying it was a cash grab, but so was any tacked on MP back in the late 2000's. Companies started doing that so people wouldn't resell their games and could provide online content, which was easier than story missions. Also I wouldn't say people loved it and praised it. It had a cult following for sure but overall consenus, based on game review sites, were it was kinda okay. Also I think you might be getting confused mtx is only considered a mtx when theres an alternative currency. I see what you're trying to say but the Map packs would just be considered DLC, same with codec and character slots. It was still bad but not necessarily a mtx
&gt; So, for me personally, I find it painfully hypocritical that we have room for games like MGO2, but none for Survive, when, far as I'm concerned, they're both on par with one another, and the only difference, far as I can see, is that one at least had a fairly decent if mixed single player, and the other had a lot of t-bagging.

But MGO2 was bundled with MGS4. It also existed in a prior format as MGO1 on MGS3, and that sever shut down ever faster. Being a multiplayer component isn't necessarily a spin off. Not to mention the game still followed the base mechanics of MGS4. I feel the best description is when it's standalone its sold seperately, and that was only Japan. If you bought MGO2 standalone than yeah but im guessing you got it with MGS4, based on how your arguing.

Otesánek is a Czech fairy tale created by Karel Jaromír Erben which tells the story of a fearsome and constantly hungry, living log of wood. In the story there are elements of narrative that are similar to more famous fairy tales such as The Adventures of Pinocchio and Little Red Riding Hood; despite this, the themes present in Otesánek appear nonetheless to be quite different from most other European fairy tales, with a particularly ambiguous moral which leaves a lot of room to subjective interpretation.

Kr1tya3,,,"Britain is now running a current budget surplus as tax revenues cover all day to day spending, for the first full year since 2001.


This surplus, which excludes capital investment by the Government, came in at £3.8bn for 2017, the Office for National Statistics said.


George Osborne set this as a target in 2010 and hoped to achieve it two years earlier in 2015.


More good news is expected later this month as the Office for Budget Responsibility is set to upgrade its growth forecasts, giving the Chancellor a windfall of extra tax revenues.


The International Monetary Fund said Britain set an example for other countries to follow in slashing the deficit by cutting public spending, rather than raising taxes.


“Following the financial crisis, the two countries that adopted spending-based austerity and did better than the rest of the sample were Ireland and the UK,” the IMF report said.


“The result: growth in the United Kingdom was higher than the European average.”


It is increasingly important that other countries copy this approach, the IMF said, as Governments around the world have racked up too much debt which will harm growth and stifle productivity when interest rates rise.


The surge in global growth gives countries the perfect opportunity to cut their debt burdens - and they should do it by cutting spending rather than by raising taxes, before the economy slows down again and the debt burden becomes tougher to bear.


“Countries take a smaller hit to growth if they cut spending - including for entitlement programs - than if they raise taxes. In fact, the latter can be self-defeating, leading to even higher debt and lower growth,” said Camilla Lund Andersen in the IMF’s Finance and Development report.


“Governments should use the current upswing to put their house in order. And while each country must chart its own course, the global recovery presents a rare opportunity - rising interest rates will soon make it harder to refinance and service debt.”


Advanced economies have an average government debt of 104pc of GDP, which is close to the highest levels seen since the Second World War.


Political momentum behind deficit reduction has waned in many countries, as years of fiscal restraint led to policy fatigue and the economic recovery made debt reduction appear less important.


But the IMF warns that upbeat assessments of the global economy “ignore debt levels that remain close to historic highs and the inevitable end of the cyclical upswing”.


“Servicing debt will become a major burden,” it warns.


Spending cuts have been unpopular in some instances, but a new study from economists Alberto Alesina, Carlo Favero, and Francesco Giavazzi indicates they are less damaging than tax rises.


“Our conclusion runs against the basic Keynesian message, which implies that spending cuts are more recessionary than tax increases,” the trio found.


“On the contrary, our study confirms that expenditure-based plans generally were less harmful to growth than tax-based plans.”


Studying a range of deficit-cutting programmes, the economists found spending cuts of 1pc of GDP hit economic growth by 0.5 percentage points relative to the trend rate of growth, with the dent put in growth lasting for less than two years.


If this is done at a time of economic growth it has no negative impact, so the economy grows even at a time of austerity.


By contrast plans based on tax hikes resulted in a two percentage point fall in GDP relative to its previous path.


“This large recessionary effect tends to last several years,” they said.


This also indicates Britain did the right thing after 2010 by cutting spending to keep the public finances in line.",True,0,1519975455,,False,0,dv27jx1,True,t3_81cjsd,False,t3_81cjsd,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/81cjsd/back_in_black_uk_in_current_budget_surplus_as_imf/dv27jx1/,1524730152,14,True,False,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,public,

Mana drain is a good comparison Target for that , presale 70€/77$ and presale Stock was around 90 copies .
Now a few month later , the IMA copy has over 500 Listings and starts as low as 33€/35$ .

yodatsracist,,,"Cool actually *hasn’t* been cycled through in the same way as the other examples you give. Check out /u/sunagainstgold’s answer in /r/askhistorians:

 * [Is there any reason why ""cool"" has had such a cultural sticking power while other slang terms have frequently come and gone?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7ptwel/is_there_any_reason_why_cool_has_had_such_a/dsk9fps/)

This is speculative  but I  wonder, though, if these cycles of words don’t have to do with *sub*cultures, particularly distinct youth-based and/or music-based subcultures, that I’m not sure existed in the same way historically before the era of mass production and mass communication. These subcultures have their own linguistic, sartorial, and other cultural norms that differentiate insiders in-the-know from what we might call, well, “uncool” outsiders. These mass production-disseminated youth subcultures, as far as I know, go at least as far back as books and printed material. I know that Goethe’s *The Sorrows of Young Werther* influenced the emerging capital-R Romantic subculture. These sorts of youth movements obviously took off with music based subcultures once albums and radios become widely available, though in America these often build on the African-American subculture/culture which developed along separate lines in America due to Blacks’ pariah status until at least the 60’s. Arguably, the earlier European Romantic movement tried to build off another pariah group, the Rroma, which is why cool downtown distincts are called “Bohemian” even today. Here’s etymonline explain (notice the spread through mass produced books and plays):

&gt;The French used *bohemién* since 15c. to also mean ""Gypsy."" The Roma were wrongly believed to have come from there, perhaps because their first appearance in Western Europe may have been immediately from Bohemia, or because they were confused with the 15c. Bohemian Hussite heretics, who were driven from their country about that time.

&gt;The transferred sense, in reference to unconventional living, is attested in French by 1834 and was popularized by Henri Murger's stories from the late 1840s later collected as ""*Scenes de la Vie de Boheme*"" (the basis of Puccini's ""*La Bohème*""). It appears in English 1848 in Thackary's ""*Vanity Fair.*""

The Romantics, in creating the boundaries of cool-before-it-was-“cool”, explicitly tried to draw on the existing Rroma culture, one of the few local “Others” in Europe. 

This isn’t quite about subcultural linguistic trends, but it is about linguistic trends that I think can only be talked about in terms of mass-produced culture. There’s this a great scene in Balzac’s *Père Goriot* where they  make fun of language trends which I assume are tied to mass production (the mass audience comes in this period from mass printing), but may not be (Sun may be able to say if medieval linguistic trends and fashions existed like that). The following scene takes place in a boarding house called Maison Vauquer, where the titular “Father Goriot” and main character Eugene both live:

&gt;The boarders dropped in one after another, interchanging greetings and the empty jokes that certain classes of Parisians regard as humorous and witty. Dullness is their prevailing ingredient, and the whole point consists in mispronouncing a word or in a gesture. This kind of argot is always changing. The essence of the jest consists in 
some catchword suggested by a political event, an incident in the police courts, a street song, or a bit of burlesque at some theater, and forgotten in a month. Anything and everything serves to keep up a game of battledore and shuttlecock with words and ideas. The diorama, a recent invention, which carried an optical illusion a degree further than panoramas, had given rise to a mania among art students for ending every word with rama. The Maison Vauquer 
had caught the infection from a young artist among the 
boarders. 

&gt;""Well, Monsieur-r-r Poiret,"" said the employee from the 
Museum, ""how is your health-orama ?"" Then, without waiting for an answer, he turned to Mme. Couture and Victorine with a ""Ladies, you seem melancholy."" 

&gt;""Is dinner ready?"" cried Horace Bianchon, a medical student, and a friend of Rastignac's; ""my stomach is sinking usque ad taiones [I’m looking at a OCR scanned copy and I think the character recognition failed here]."" 

&gt;""There is an uncommon frozerama outside !"" said Vautrin. ""Make room there. Father Goriot! Confound it! your foot covers the whole front of the stove."" 

&gt;""Illustrious M. Vautrin,"" put in Bianchon, ""why do you say frozerama? It is incorrect; it should be frozenrama."" 

&gt;""No, it shouldn't,"" said the official from the museum; ""frozerama is right by the same rule that you say 'My feet are froze.'"" [...]

&gt;""Aha! here is a magnificent soupe-au-rama,"" cried Poiret as Christophe came in bearing the soup with cautious heed. 

&gt;""I beg your pardon, sir,"" said Mme. Vauquer; ""it is soup aux choux."" [...]

&gt; ""Did any one notice the fog this morning?"" asked the official. 

&gt;""It was a frantic fog,"" said Bianchon, ""a fog unparalleled, doleful, melancholy, sea-green, asthmatical— a Goriot of a fog!"" 

&gt;""A Goriorama,"" said the art student, ""because you couldn't see a thing in it.""

I am happy that this article shocked you enough to run out of arguments and fall straight to the leftist level of ad hominem. It is a good news that no-one here had any factual argument against this, showing that your answer is emotional and not rational. But also showing the feminine mindset that has been programmed in your brain. Anyway. You call me incel, and you are so far from reality. I know PUAs well, very well. I read Neil Strauss, Vox, Chateau, watched Tyler, etc. I hanged out with dozens of so called PUAs and MGTOW. Yet, 99% of them are single, sad, and without children. Factually, if we call evolution to remove the weaks, then these people are part of it. That is strange, right? Of course you can downvote me as a sign of feminine emotional reaction, but that won't change facts. Feminism has destroyed the family unit, yes. The natural order of things is the family, and having children. Your child can't be healthy without his father at home, that is also a scientific fact. Listen to Molyneux, he treated very well the subject. PUAs and MGTOW are just the opposite side of the same coin that is called feminism. It is a female ideology, not a manly one. It is a left ideology, not a right one. And it is a liberal ideology, not a conservative one. It is no surprise that inside groups like RSD you find many immigrants and leftists. Now, let's push it further. In a near future, as Vox already believes, the mass immigration in the us and europe will lead to war. Muslims do make children, and a lot. How do you planned fighting if your focus is to pick-up women? Why would you even fight if you think that family and having children doesn't matter? And if we already all old without children, who's gonna fight for our genes, our culture? These questions, you ain't gonna answer your ""own way"", but collectively. You won't be able to defend yourself if we don't control our women. Finally, I see someone saying that all of that ain't conspiracy. Again, how could you be so much in denial and uninformed?

Farming payments are one recent example of this.

UnchainedMundane,,,"How about this one:

 The fact that so many books still name the Beatles as ""the greatest or most significant or most influential"" rock band ever only tells you how far rock music still is from becoming a serious art. Jazz critics have long recognized that the greatest jazz musicians of all times are Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Classical critics rank the highly controversial Beethoven over classical musicians who were highly popular in courts around Europe. Rock critics are still blinded by commercial success. The Beatles sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. Jazz critics grow up listening to a lot of jazz music of the past, classical critics grow up listening to a lot of classical music of the past. Rock critics are often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that the Beatles did anything worthy of being saved.

potpan0,," ❌ 🙏 ❌ No Gods, No Masters ❌ 👑 ❌","&gt; why race exists is because that variance is happening in distinctly different ways and has a shape particular to that race.

That isn't why race exists. Race is a social construct. This means what we consider as different 'races' isn't particularly scientific or biological, it's to do with broader social factors. A good way to show this is to look at how people have viewed the 'white' race in different ways. In early 20th century America, people from Ireland, Italy, Spain and Eastern Europe were not viewed as being as 'white' as people from countries such as Germany and England. Similarly, in Nazi Germany 'Aryan' was a term largely reserved for 'Germanic' people. However, today, we view basically everyone in Europe, from Ireland to Spain to Sweden to Russia, as 'white'. And this shows that our considerations of race are not particularly scientifically grounded, they are a social construct.

OSCAR G.

(Nervous/Murk-Miami)



If you were to get out a map and track the history of house music with endless lines sprouting from New York, Chicago and Detroit to points all over the world you’d have to make a big, red circle around Miami, Florida, and start drawing.



Miami was never ground zero to a full-fledged subcultural movement. But it is where Oscar Gaetan, better known as Oscar G, has lived every day of his life. And that fact alone makes it a hub on the global underground.

An award-winning songwriter, producer, and DJ, Oscar is one of dance music’s brightest and most enduring stars. As part of seminal production teams Liberty City, Murk, and Funky Green Dogs, he boasts hits, Billboard chart-toppers as well as underground smashes in every decade, every trend, and every market. Some Lovin ,Fired Up, and Dark Beat are more than just tracks: They are moments, shared by clubbers worldwide. They’re the kind of moments Oscar still creates at Space Miami, his hometown superclub, where he’s been a resident DJ for a staggering eight years coming full circle after a globetrotting career.



Oscar and longtime friend and production partner Ralph Falcon grew up in a Miami enlivened by the fresh spirit of hip-hop. ?Break dancing, graffiti and the music that went along with it: That’s really what got me into DJ-ing in the first place, he says. By the age of 12, he was already spinning at school dances.



Oscar and Ralph started working together at the end of high school, blending the sounds of their youth with the beginnings of house, like Ten City and Blaze; and the darker Euro bands of the time, like Depeche Mode and New Order. “We were always big on doing our own sound, with our own feeling and vibe in every aspect of it; from the way we mixed things to the sounds we chose” says Oscar. “I remember being obsessed with that for years, and then people started to listen”.



The early years bore some of the work for which they’re still best known, like often imitated, never duplicated vocals Some Lovin, If You Really Love Someone, and Reach For Me (Tribal). Upon their release in 1993, the pair became instant superstars. “Europe kind of grabbed us” says Oscar, so they spent a good amount of time touring overseas, eventually visiting every major and minor outpost of the global dance scene, including Zouk Singapore, Ministry Of Sound London, and Stereo Montreal.



Fired Up! (Twisted), their biggest hit ever, followed in 1996. It topped the Billboard Dance chart, and even cracked the Top 100, peaking at No. 80. They would go on to remix countless major pop artists, from Madonna to Cher to Donna Summer; and appear on mainstream outlets like MTV and Top Of The Pops. The boys also cut two complete Funky Green Dogs albums for major label MCA, Star (1999) and Super California (2001). But their own measures of success were still decidedly underground: “Once Junior Vasquez played our records at Sound Factory [in New York], we felt like we could retire, and at that point we were like 20” says Oscar.



In March 2000, Space opened in downtown Miami with Oscar as the Saturday night resident, just as the world was paying its annual visit for Winter Music Conference. The club with its cavernous main room, pummeling German sound system and nitrogen blasts was the talk of dance world, and the legend of Oscar’s residency began to grow.



The year 2003 was a big one. Oscar released the Live @ Space (Star 69) compilation, and won the Club World Award for Best Resident DJ (which he won again in 2007). Murk set a new Billboard Dance chart record, with five No. 1's in a single year: Four singles from their self-titled artist album on Tommy Boy Records, and Dark Beat (Twisted), tribal house’s first real vocal anthem, which found its way from dance floors onto mainstream radio. “We came up with Dark Beat in about 15 minutes. Whenever things come that quickly, you know there’s something to them” says Oscar. “But we didn’t think radio or anthem; we were thinking more like, Oh man, Danny Tenaglia’s gonna be all over this!”



In 2006, Oscar became one of Pacha New York’s only non-NY-based monthly residents, strengthening his bond with his home-away-from-home, and its rich dance history. He released a second installment in the Space series in 2007, starting new relationships with Nervous Records in the U.S. and CR2 in the U.K. CR2 also snapped up the Murk catalog, and commissioned new remixes of the classic tracks, including Paul Woolford’s takes on If You Really Love Someone and Reach For Me. And in 2008, after nearly two decades making music, Oscar released his first solo album, Innov8 (Nervous).



Even though his passion for music creation is undeniable, it’s in his DJ booth where Oscar feels most at home: Both at Space, and at his regular club dates across North and Latin America each weekend. “On the music side, I’ve felt pretty energized lately, because the changes in the industry really enable you to be a lot more experimental and take more chances” he says. “But DJ-ing to me always comes first: I really believe in it as an art form. Having a residency like Space, with a regular crowd, it’s the ultimate.”

MrJohz,,"Right wing, but only by Corbyn's standards","For free! One of them literally said the words ""for free"", and the other described the ID card as something temporary you'd get in the post for each election. Both completely acknowledged that this is basically a non-issue, and offered their suggestions more as reassurances than as solutions for a major national problem.

I recognise that Republicans in the US have traditionally used voter ID as a dogwhistle tactic to discriminate against poorer people who can't afford ID, or wouldn't know how to get hold of it. There are certainly issues with voter ID schemes. However, there are good reasons for ID cards as well. Many Europeans don't need to get passports if they travel solely within the EU, making holidays cheaper and more affordable for poorer folk. You also avoid some situations where proof of address is the only viable option for proof of identity. An ID card system could potentially make it easier for people without permanent addresses to take part in normal activities.

Rkhighlight,Globalisierungsgewinner,Globalisierungsgewinner,"&gt;Egal ob es die „kleinen Leute“ sind, oder Menschen, denen es ökonomisch noch gut geht, die sich aber Sorgen über die Zukunft machen – sie wurden weniger gehört und in letzter Zeit immer mehr moralisch von einer tonangebenden akademischen Klasse abgewertet. Der von dieser Klasse getragene kosmopolitische Liberalismus ist sowohl im Merkel-Flügel der Union, als auch unter vielen Funktionären der SPD und der Grünen sowie im Kipping-Flügel der Linkspartei hegemonial geworden. Auch im Journalismus ist er sehr verbreitet.

Dies, dies so sehr. Auch wenn ich schon etliche Mal diesen Artikel empfohlen habe, kann ich nicht oft genug auf [""die globale Klasse""](https://m.tagesspiegel.de/politik/die-globale-klasse-eine-andere-welt-ist-moeglich-aber-als-drohung/14737914.html) verweisen: 

&gt;Der sich aufspannende globale Raum habe den Aufstieg dieser neuen Klasse ermöglicht. Die „globale Klasse“ ist es, die für sich die Chancen der Globalisierung entdeckt und sie zu ihrer Produktivkraft gemacht hat: den Unterschied. Damit meinte er schon damals nicht nur den kapitalistischen Großunternehmer, der seine Produktion nach Asien verlagert, sondern auch den Jogalehrer oder das chinesische Familienrestaurant in Bottrop.

[...]

&gt;Es gibt heute eine globalisierte Klasse der Informationsarbeiter, der die meisten von uns angehören und die viel homogener und mächtiger ist, als sie denkt. Es sind gut gebildete, tendenziell eher junge Menschen, die sich kulturell zunehmend global orientieren, die die ""New York Times"" lesen statt die Tagesschau zu sehen, die viele ausländische Freunde und viele Freunde im Ausland haben, die viel reisen, aber nicht unbedingt, um in den Urlaub zu fahren. **Es ist eine Klasse, die fast ausschließlich in Großstädten lebt, die so flüssig Englisch spricht wie ihre Muttersprache, für die Europa kein abstraktes Etwas ist, sondern eine gelebte Realität, wenn sie zum Jobwechsel von Madrid nach Stockholm zieht.**

[...]

&gt;Eine wachsende Gruppe global orientierter Menschen gibt es in jedem Land dieser Erd, und sie ist gut vernetzt. **Diese neue globalisierte Klasse sitzt in den Medien, in den StartUps und NGOs, in den Parteien, und weil sie die Informationen kontrolliert („liberal media“, „Lügenpresse“), gibt sie überall kulturell und politisch den Takt vor. Das heißt nicht, dass sie politisch homogen im eigentlichen Sinne ist – zumindest empfindet sie sich nicht so – sie ist zum Beispiel in Deutschland fast im gesamten Parteienspektrum zu finden, in der CDU, SPD, LINKE, GRÜNE, FDP.** Diese Klasse entspringt dem Bürgertum, aber hat sich von ihm emanzipiert.

[...]

&gt;Die Machtverschiebung ging im Stillen vor sich. Irgendwann begann sich der progressivere Teil des Bürgertums sozial enger mit seinesgleichen über Ländergrenzen hinweg zu vernetzen und kulturell zu orientieren. Die globale Klasse entstand und hat den kulturellen Wandel der Globalisierung beschleunigt. Globale Standards nicht nur in der Wirtschaft, sondern auch in Politik, Kultur und Moral. **Die progressiven, zunehmend global Orientierten haben die anderen einfach abgehängt. Aber weil sie anders herrscht und weil sie sich dabei mit der Gesellschaft selbst verwechselt, merkt sie es nicht mal.** Sie hat keine Gewalt auf ihrer Seite, und die meisten haben noch nicht einmal wahnsinnig viel Geld.

[...] 

&gt;**Und das merken die anderen, die kulturell Abgehängten.** Sie merken, dass uns ihre Welt zu klein geworden ist, dass wir uns moralisch überlegen fühlen und dass wir nach Größerem streben. **Vor allem merken sie, dass wir dabei erfolgreich sind, dass wir auf diesem Weg die Standards definieren, die nach und nach auch an sie selbst angelegt werden.** Ökologische, antirassistische, antisexistische Standards. Politisch korrekte Standards eben. Und die Standards, die dabei entwertet und verdrängt werden, kamen mal aus dem Bürgertum, aus einer Zeit, als sie noch das Sagen hatten. Es ist eine kulturelle Gentrifizierung.

&gt;Auf magische Weise hat das Bürgertum trotz Grundbesitz, privater Krankenvorsorge und leitender Angestelltenfunktion die Deutungshoheit verloren. „Take Back Control“, der Slogan der Brexiter ist der eigentliche Schlachtruf all der neurechten Bewegungen. **Es gibt gerade im Bürgertum das Gefühl des Kontrollverlusts. Gemeint damit ist der Verlust der kulturellen Hegemonie, der als nationale „Souveränität“ erinnert wird.** Englische Standards wurden in England bestimmt, Deutsche in Deutschland, amerikanische in den USA. Die globale Klasse bringt alles durcheinander!

[...]

&gt;**Und weil man gegen die globale Klasse nicht moralisch und argumentativ gewinnen kann, bleibt der alternativen Rechten nur noch, jede Moral und jedes Argument zu verweigern.** Trump und Brexit und die Rehabilitation von „Völkisch“ sind argumentative und moralische Pflastersteine in unsere Vitrinen. **Sie sind der internationale Aufstand gegen die kulturelle Hegemonie der globalen Klasse.**

Gerade der Erfolg der AfD, die nunmal nicht nur oder gar überwiegend aus wirtschaftlich Abgehängten besteht, bestätigt die These, dass es sich hauptsächlich um sozio-kulturelle und nicht sozio-ökonomische Probleme handelt. Der Ruf nach Lügenpresse, Altparteien und Linksgrünversifft wird immer als ""wer rechts außen steht, für den ist nunmal alles links"" abgetan. Doch wir merken oft nicht, wie homogen wir sind, da es nicht unserer Binnenwahrnehmung entspricht. Humanismus, EU, Minderheitenschutz und Fortschritt sind alles progressive Werte, die gar nicht mehr hinterfragt wurden, weil sie als selbstverständlich galten. Dabei gibt es aber einen überraschen großen Teil der Gesellschaft, die einige dieser Werte einfach nicht teilt.

MrJohz,,"Right wing, but only by Corbyn's standards","One person literally stated that it is a non-issue.

&gt; This seems like a non-issue though.

And the other person said they didn't believe voter fraud had a meaningful impact on elections.

&gt;  If there was voter fraud on any scale that meaningfully affected elections, however, I think it would be noticed more.

And again, both people suggested entirely free ID cards.  Now sure, this could be changed, but so can literally everything about our country, including arbitrarily electing some random dictator who will force us all to work in his spice mines.  This seems unlikely, however.  Many European countries manage to require ID to vote without it seeming to have huge impacts on voter enfranchisement.  Germany, for example, has mandatory IDs, and France requires everyone to have some form of ID, although it doesn't mandate which form of ID they use.

There are clear benefits for ID cards, particularly if they're offered free for all citizens, as in both suggestions.  As I explained, they could well be used to help poorer or less enfranchised people by providing them with an identity document that they don't need to pay for at all.  That is fairly difficult to come by!

&gt; Just a coincidence that they all are, then?

delegeferanda,,,"&gt; At du velger å overse dette og komme med en patetisk unnskyldning om at jeg er ""følelsesladet"" beviser

Her er du på luggeføre igjen, du må skille mellom hva som åpenbart er useriøse kommentarer og hva som ikke er det, noe jeg påpekte klart. Imidlertid ser man enda klarere hvor sensitivt tema dette er for deg.

&gt; Norge vil alltid inneha et demokratisk underskudd enten vi forblir utenfor eller velger å innlemme oss gjennom det enkle faktum at vi utgjør en veldig liten representativ del av Europas befolkning. Og så lenge vi forblir utenfor gjelder ikke uunngåelige motargumentet du vil komme med ""at det er slik det fungerer i et demokrati"". Vi er ikke en del av det demokratiet og å velge å bli med er netto økonomisk tap for Norge og alle de som bor her nettopp av den grunn.

Her har du noen alvorlige mangler med innsikten din i EU-systemet. Å tro at befolkningstallet, representativiteten, vil stikke kjepper i hjulet for beslutningsdyktigheten - et medlemskap vil gi - er virvar. Lovgivningen er institusjonalisert helt annerledes enn det vi er kjent med fra norsk forfatningsrett, herunder vil det viktigste lovgivningsorganet, Det eurpeiske unions råd, ikke hensynta befolkningstall men vektlegge stater ekvivalent. Det er heller bare i de siste året at Parlamentet har fått større lovgiverrolle, og heller ikke der er det tale om normal representativitet. Det nevnte avstedkommer en verdig lovgiverrolle for Norge, ikke det bilde du fortegner.

&gt; Derfor burde vi komme oss ut av EØS så fort som mulig.

Helt riktig at vi kommer oss ut av den demokratiske ubalansen, men å melde seg ut av EØS uten en avledet avtale er det samme som å sette Norge i en tidsmaskin sannsynligvis minst 10 år tilbake i tid (grunnet den vektige og moderne sekundærlovgivningen) - og restaureringsprosessen vil være uforholdsmessig belastende for norsk økonomi. Og resultatet? Vi står utenfor Europas indre marked - hvor ingen særskilt endring skjer med jordbruks- og fiskeripolitikken.

Og la oss ikke glemme noe av det viktigste!
Folkeavstemning er overhodet ikke institusjonalisert, som du nesten gir inntrykk av at det er - vi har i kraft av folkesuvereniteten bestemt at vi har et representativt demokrati - ikke direkte som du legger føringer an til må være avgjørende. NEI - faktisk talt er de legitimt valgte stortingsrepresentantene som velger om vi skal være med i EU. 

""Men det må jo legge adekvate føringer på hvilke avtaler vi skal slutte"". 

**Feil igjen!** EØS innebærer reell og formell (ESA) suverenitetsavståelse, og jeg kan ikke huske det norske folk ble spurt.

dietderpsy,,,"Look at Ireland for the answer to this, gangs have always existed in Ireland but you can see the evolution.

In the past gangs were mostly local street gangs who would fight with fists and sometimes weapons, it was mostly beat downs and slashings, there were rarely fatal encounters, these guys though would beat up a lot on ordinary people so they were a big problem for society.

Then you had the top level criminal gangs who were hardened criminals, they robbed banks and did other high grade robberies, they were always a lot more violent, they maimed but rarely did they kill. Even these guys didn't have very many guns.

When the IRA broke up a lot of their guns were sold to the top level criminal gangs, now you saw a lot of armed robberies on armoured cars, the Government then used Tier 1 Special Forces to guard the armoured cars and that wasn't much of a problem anymore.

When drugs became big on the scene the top level criminals became hyper aggressive, similar to the drug cartels in South America.They starting arming themselves with heavier weapons from Europe,and they started pitched gun battles with each other on the streets,something that just didn't happen in Ireland.

The thing is Ireland has very strict gun control, most of our cops don't even carry, so in order to get a gun, even a 9mm, you need serious connections, it's like buying a cruise missile, the average thug doesn't have a gun, so gun crime very rarely ever affects the public. It's only really the top level guys, think major organised crime syndicates.

Now If you ask some of the original top level guys what changed on the scene, they will tell you drugs. Of course though in America it is different, there is what I call a gun saturation, guns are everywhere, there are too easy to get a hold of, the average street thug can be armed, now it affects the public more. 

Easy access to weapons is a major problem, you can arm yourself but you are not equal, you don't set out that day to steal or kill, the criminal does, if he lives in an armed society he won't take the chance and hold you up, he is going to kill you, it doesn't seem logical, why would he risk a life sentence for a robbery but these low level guys are stupid or high, that makes them very dangerous.

I think legalizing certain drugs will reduce the aggression, legalizing marijuana and psychedelics will generally be harmless, legalizing cocaine, opium or meth will be different, addicts of such drugs don't know when to stop, they can spend their entire wages on drugs and they will still go out and rob people to get more.

The supply side will be greatly affected at the local level, the top level criminals will simply enter into the legal drug trade and lose a percentage, these guys are business cartels who operate multiple business ventures, to make a real impact on them you need to 'mark them' and then assassinate every single one of them, in single very large operations, of course these organisations get replaced but you just keep flattening them.

I've seen a lot of Foreign media, like BBC, criticizing about Chinese rulings, laws, international actions, but they never questioned about the GDP growth of China. according to your link, the annual growth rate of GDP of china is 6.9%, have you learned about macroeconomics that it was abnormal-even too high. Are you questioning your source credibility in your link?

you mentioned that democracy is must for if the next president is a fool, he will devastate the country. That's COMPLETLEY true. However, Chinese folks, to some extent, even don't care about democracy. Indians, however, was cultivated to be ""democratic"" since they were much more affected by Europeans, like British colonizers. But in Chinese, the folks just want a good leader no matter in which form. In 20th century, they even don't know what is democracy.

Americans did not do that? You are implying that there is no racists in America towards China (as lots of Chinese discriminate Americans too)? So how can you explain in some websites I see words like F**K Chinese out? If you want I can give you links, though I believe 
it's a common fact that there's still some people are racists in America. I'm hoping you are not intentionally beautifying them.

I know that in this part our history is wrong (even a normal person can know that), but I do not know the fact either. As you said in Wiki, there's controversy because British colonizers previously states the region to India, but the Chinese gov refutes to acknowledge this behavior, known as McMahon Line. Indians never invades anyone, but what about the Doklam ( I almost read everything on wiki since you think its authoratative, but the condition is that Indian gov is interfering the Bhutan gov.

Your Gamertag: MaskoBlackfyre
Your country/time zone: Croatia, EU (CET, GMT +1)
When do you usually play (include times and time zone):

During the week I usually play after work, between 6 pm and 11 pm (CET)
Over the weekend I play more often and whenever I feel like it, because I don't work Saturday and Sunday

Tell us a bit about yourself (ex: experience in Destiny, how many characters, Light Levels, anything else):

I'm a Destiny veteran. Started mid-The Dark Below, clocked over 2000 hours by the time D2 launched.
I have all 3 characters up to 400 light in D1, with a Grimoire Score of 5525.
I went flawless in all eras of the game and even gave a Scarab emblem (if anyone actually cares about that), but I never enjoyed playing Trials due to never having an steady team interested in learning and growing as a team and as individual players.

In D2 I have only one character, my Titan, at 334 (missing a 335 kinetic).
IRL I'm in my 30's, working as a Software Engineer.

What are you looking for in a clan (for example: PvE, PvP, any special criteria):

I'd like to find a European clan with people similar to myself, employed, at least in their mid-to-late 20's and above.
I have nothing against American players, but we're not in the same time-zone and after many years of being in an american clan, I'm sick and tired of playing until 4 am because I'm the only European so I'm the one that needs to adjust.
Similarly, with all do respect, I don't have a lot in common with teenagers. We may like the same game, but I'm no jaded and rash to pass judgement on a game just because I don't agree with all the developer decisions.
I like Destiny and I like Destiny 2 and I'm fed up with listening about how ""the game used to be good, now it's trash"".

Lastly, a bit about me as a player. I like PVE over PVP in both Destiny games. I'm decent but not great in PVP, but I'm pretty good at PVE. I like soloing stuff, but I'd much rather have a well coordinated and knowledgeable team to play with.
I'm not as good as Esoterikk (that man is has truly become Legend), but I'm the same type of player.

Stenny007,,,"Dutch companies get to sit at the table with the Dutch ministry of finance like all other large complex companies. Shell, Unilever, Aegon, Phillips are treated like any other non-Dutch company and can use the 'seat at the table'' option.

And yes, thats something we have been doing since early modern times. And it works good for us. We cant be forced to change our ways simply because the EU feels like we should. I mean, sure, we should be understanding as we now share a common market. And im out of principle agreeing that we should reform our taxes. But ill be damned if fools like Macron think they have the right to dictate how our tax system should work. And ill be damned if Merkel thinks she can ''demand'' we listen to what the Germans want, while she herself is instating toll for non Germans on highways part funded by Dutch subsidies because Dutch transport companies and Dutch civilians used it.

I know that was just a anectdote and basically irrelevant to the Dutch tax reform dicussion, but it shows something very important. It shows that the Germans feel like they can expect European 
collaboration based on EU principles and vallues whenever they feel like it benefits them, but goes completely against the same principles and vallues whenever it suits them.

So knowing that the Dutch citizen is already the biggest contributor to the EU budget per capita, what cards do you think Dutch politicians have in their hands? Would you willingly and without comments accept the demands from France and Germany? Or would you use this moment for a long term solution to a much larger problem? This problem being the political balance within the EU?

What kind of example would we make if we act submissive and do as the big boys want us to do? Note that the last elections in the Netherlands were celebrated as a EU victory because the VVD won, but the number of seats for anti-EU politicians has been rising since the early 2000s. The Macron comment was gold for people like Wilders. Its shit like that that fuels Dutch skeptism.

The Dutch feel like they are the ones who pay the bill of EU ambitions and projects yet get no place at the table where all the big decisions are made. Merkel was discussing trade relations with Trump between the EU and US, she had phone communication with Macron while in Washington. How insane is that considering that the Netherlands outranks both Germany and France in investments in the US? 

Wilders literally used that example in several speeches a few months ago. It worked greatly on his audience. Now i find Wilders a complete moron and will never back him up. But here s the catch. Since last year we have more parties openly anti-EU. Both on the left and right, both directed at higher educated/income people and wilders for the lower income/educated.

Something changed last year in the Netherlands. Wealthier and better educated people no longer have to be ashamed to admit that they vote anti-EU. Thats a big difference from 5 years ago. You would be instantly seen as a dumb ass racist PVV/Wilders supporter if you were anti EU. This will be a big thing next elections here.

Some of it is “There can’t be that big a difference or circ wouldn’t be that commonplace.” But speaking as an intact American guy (who knows a lot of intact American guys), I’d say a big factor is “Why draw attention to myself? Nothing can happen to circumcised guys. They’ve already been operated on and no one is after any other part of their penis. But every day of my life I’m vulnerable. Millions tell me I should get cut, millions more seem to delight in insulting me, and I don’t want to jinx things and end up having to get cut for some reason. So, mum’s the word.” 

Another factor is humility. Without having walked a mile in the other guy’s shoes, how do I know for certain that I have it better? And even if I’m sure of it, wouldn’t it be a dick move to start bragging about it? No good can come from telling circumcised guys that they’re inferior or missing out, or even implying it.

The FBI didn't receive the Steele Dossier until October 2016. But Steele did contact an FBI agent in Rome in July 2016. 

&gt; Britain’s spy agencies played a crucial role in alerting their counterparts in Washington to contacts between members of Donald Trump’s campaign team and Russian intelligence operatives, the Guardian has been told.

&gt; GCHQ first became aware in late 2015 of suspicious “interactions” between figures connected to Trump and known or suspected Russian agents, a source close to UK intelligence said. This intelligence was passed to the US as part of a routine exchange of information, they added.

&gt; Over the next six months, until summer 2016, a number of western agencies shared further information on contacts between Trump’s inner circle and Russians, sources said.

&gt; The European countries that passed on electronic intelligence – known as sigint – included Germany, Estonia and Poland. Australia, a member of the “Five Eyes” spying alliance that also includes the US, UK, Canada and New Zealand, also relayed material, one source said.

&gt; Another source suggested the Dutch and the French spy agency, the General Directorate for External Security or DGSE, were contributors.

&gt; It is understood that GCHQ was at no point carrying out a targeted operation against Trump or his team or proactively seeking information. The alleged conversations were picked up by chance as part of routine surveillance of Russian intelligence assets. Over several months, different agencies targeting the same people began to see a pattern of connections that were flagged to intelligence officials in the US.

cbus20122,,,"I posted this big post late last night in response to another redditor, and figured I should share it today so it gets seen. **This is a bearish post** that highlights a decent (but not all) amount of the fundamental market risks within the USA right now. If you are bullish, that's great! Use this to be aware of counter-arguments and ""the other side of the fence"". I'm not sure when the market will crash, but seeing certain scenarios playing out can help you make more informed decisions about how to invest and whether you should be more conservative or aggressive. The main thing here, is you should have a plan, and know what you will do in the event that certain things play out. Do you have a plan for how to invest if inflation ticks up? What about deflation? What about trade wars? The point is to be prepared essentially, which also means having a plan for a continued ""goldilocks"" boom. 

I'm sticking just to USA scenarios here. I'm trying to avoid technicals and other soft indicators like bullishness vs. bearishness ratio, volatilility ratios, etc. With that said, price action and technicals can indicate bearish scenarios playing out, especially if they coincide with real things starting to occur like higher rates, or potential trade wars, or large defaulting companies (just as examples).

Also, note that my mention of consumer debt is a huge post, so that kind of accounts for a ton on its very own.

**1. Corporate debt is at a completely unstustainable level, and is far higher than it's ever been.** This is not a huge problem during a low-rate economy where the economy is soaring without inflation. But the issue is that once anything starts to falter, all that debt becomes just a massive liability, which is hugely problematic. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NCBDBIQ027S

**2. The advance decline of the largest stocks vs. smaller stocks is worrying.** This is a lesser talked about leading indicator for bear markets that has been pretty good at predicting bigger downturns. Basically, as markets mature and head towards bear markets, people often tend to pile into big names and are less likely to sell those bigger names. This often leaves smaller cap stocks to underperform the largest behemoths.  See a short backtest here for [2006-2008](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=2006&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2008&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;endDate=03%2F01%2F2018&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;symbol1=RSP&amp;allocation1_2=100&amp;symbol2=VFINX&amp;allocation2_1=100), and [here for 2017 to current](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio#analysisResults), where I compare the S&amp;P 500 index, to the equal weight S&amp;P 500 index. The equal weight index almost always outperforms the standard index with the exception of historically doing worse pre-bear markets.  [This tweet](https://twitter.com/KimbleCharting/status/969249534512648193_) may provide a better look at the statistic in chart form.

**3. Junk Bonds have separated from equities.** There is an old saying that equity markets are always the last to figure out an incoming bear market, and credit markets are the first. So when Junk bonds tend to flatten out and become more volatile, especially when equities aren't, you should pay attention to what is going on. [Here](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/stock-market-investors-are-starting-to-freak-out-about-this-ugly-chart-2017-11-09) is a slightly dated link that provides a basic overview. The divergences aren't always enormous, but you'll notice that high-yield seems to flatten or hit a down-curve before equities head towards a recession.

**4. Valuations.** Well, I think everyone in here knows the arguments for the markets being wildly over-valued by most traditional metrics, so I don't think we really need to discuss this too much. Stock valuations are the most ""visible"" issue that people can see on average. Even if there is some rationale for the valuations (such as earnings being great right now) most of that rationale assumes that the environment of 2017 will continue into the future. That simply isn't going to happen if for no other reason than the basic laws of economics. Are there some cheap stocks out there? Sure, but the markets as a whole have become extremely speculative, and are being completely flippant to overall risk. 

**5. Bond markets.** This should be an entire post on it's own, because it can devolve into a lot of side issues. But the basic issues are that bonds provide insanely low yields right now around the globe, with some countries' bonds providing negative overall yield. This premise is caused by ultra-low interest rates, and global quantitative easing programs that have bought bonds en-masse, which causes their yields to drop like a rock and their prices to rise. This causes a lot of problems since the people who would normally buy safer bonds for a certain yield (lets say around 4%) now have to buy far riskier bonds or stocks to get a similar yield. This means people who would normally be buying safe investments are pumping more demand into riskier assets. If you're wondering why we have a major asset bubble, this is a surface glimpse of one of the main reasons. The bigger problem is that the strategies that have pumped up bonds over the past 10 years are largely closing down or slowing down this year. American QE has gone into reverse, mostly as of this year. European and Asian QE programs are either slowing down or stopping at some point this year. On top of that, inflation is becoming a more possible issue, which would cause people to bounce from bonds very quick, which would leave people holding equities with the realization that they're holding a wildly over-valued stock that won't provide the secure yield they could easily get simply from holding a bond. 

**6. Consumer debt is higher than it was before the great recession.** The big issue is that we're hardly making more money per household than we were in 2008, so how can our increasingly large debt loads be sustainable if they caused things to fall apart in 2007/2008? I wrote a very long, detailed, and sourced post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/80rgeb/us_consumer_debt_levels_downplay_monthly_burdens/) about this just the other day, so I won't write everything out here since it would be insanely long. But the premise is that we've been heading down a very unsustainable path, and there are cracks and issues starting to form in the picture here. Also, margin debt is at an all-time high, which may make deleveraging ugly. Just a quick note... economies can look extremely good on paper when credit expenditure is at all time highs, which it has been recently. 

**7. Inflation?** I'm actually not personally buying the inflation story as much as many other people are, but it definitely does have at least some legs, and rising rates may also be very real due to macro factors of the fed doing mass sell-offs of treasury bonds while also seeing tons of issuances of t-bonds from the government to fund the massive spending increases. The big pressing issue that we've been dealing with in the last month or so is that we're screwed if inflation is actually real and we do not hike the rates enough, but we're even more screwed if inflation isn't what people think and the fed hikes the rates too fast. Basically, we're on a razor's edge of trying to balance rates, and the inflation vs. deflation story, and we may only know after the fact if we have made the right choice. Even worse, there is a chance that we could see a slowing economy yet rising prices in what would mimic the stagflation era with both higher prices as well as economic recession. The stagflation notion is being driven very much by Trump's policy, much of which can possibly lead to both inflation and economic stagnation. The main thing to know here is that there is just a ton of risk looming on either side of the story. You can argue all you want that this stuff isn't real, but everything the market has done in the last month or so has proven how sensitive it is to these issues.

**8. True Money Supply Looking Ugly.** I'm not too well versed on this metric, but it has dropped like a rock before every recession since 1978, and it is getting close to previous bottoms such as in 2007 or late 1999. It's pretty illuminating to see, and makes sense based on what I know of it. Read more about it and see the chart [here](https://www.lewrockwell.com/2018/02/joseph-salerno/the-true-money-supply-is-flashing-red/).

**9. Surprising amount of economic data turning out not so great recently.** It's kind of strange since some of the data looks inflationary, but I've noticed even more data that is missing estimated marks. Durable goods orders came in really bad this week. Housing has been getting hammered since the start of the year, likely due to higher interest rates among other things. Chicago PMI came in way low. GDP estimates have been drawing down a lot, and came in far lower than initial expectations. Last week looked similar. See some of the results here: https://finviz.com/calendar.ashx . In my opinion, too many people look at jobs as the only indicator. Jobs and employment always look good before the market crashes. They may go down before a recession strikes, but most recessions aren't officially announced until well after the market has already crashed, so it's kind of an useless leading indicator.

WISavant,,,"Trump announced plans to put tariffs on US steel imports. Meaning it will cost more to for US companies buy steel that comes from other countries. 

Other countries don’t like this because it means the US could buy less of their steel so they announced that they would consider retaliatory tariffs on US goods. Meaning it would make US goods more expensive to buy in their countries so people would buy less of them. 

The simple thinking on broad tariffs is, if you make a foreign product more expensive people are more likely to buy the American product. But it’s not that simple, because you put dramatically increase the costs that companies that use the product have to cover and that can lead to job losses that are greater than any gains from the increase in manufacturing. And you have to deal with retaliation from other countries. This is different that focused tariffs on one country that can be used to punish that country for what are deemed unfair trade practices. 

Bush tried this in 2002 and it was a disaster. It led to over 200,000 lost jobs and he dropped the tariffs when European countries announced that they would institute specific tariffs that would harm US manufacturing in states that would be vital to Bush’s re-election. 

This part is my opinion. Trump is doing this because it’ll pander to the steel industry and his base that thinks we’ll be able to bring US manufacturing jobs back to 1950s levels. And because he has an incredibly limited understanding of trade deficits and international trade in general.

zed857,,,"It's hard to tell on the image you posted because the resolution is so low - but from the top down it looks like: 

- Turntable.  Just plays records.  Does not make sound by itself; it needs to be hooked up a preamp, amp or receiver to do that.

- Preamp.  Selects the source, adjusts volume and (often) has bass/treble controls (which wouldn't be used when an EQ was hooked up).

- CD player.

- Cassette.  In this case, it's a single deck.

- Tuner.  Receives FM (and probably AM and maybe even LW in Europe) radio

- Equalizer.  Yes this was usually a separate component.  Separating it out from the preamp allowed the room for more sliders/frequency adjustments and separate sets for the left / right channels.  It also meant that the preamp had a simpler/cleaner signal path for people that didn't want to use an EQ.  In this setup, the equalizer was (probably) hooked up between the pre-amp and the power amp to further modify the sound.  Also, judging by the settings on this EQ, this guy really liked midrange.

- Power amp(s?).  Amplifies the output of the pre-amp (a lot) to drive the speakers.  Usually this would just be a single component.  In your pic, it looks like it might be two or three.  It might still be just a single amp broken up into separate parts (level controls, amp itself, meters) or it might be a bi-amp setup with an active crossover, a smaller amp for the midrange/high-end and a larger amp for the bass.

You could still assemble a modern system with more or less the same type of components if you wanted to (it would *not* be cheap to do so).  Or you could cut it way down to just a turntable (maybe), a receiver (which is a preamp, tuner and power amp all in one component) and the speakers.  You could still use large full range paif of speakers or (more likely) you'd use a much dinkier set of main speakers and a separate subwoofer for the low bass.

Then you'd use a phone/PC/tablet/whatever to send MP3/Flac/whatever into one of the inputs on the receiver.

They did grow but ultimately they got less than half the votes they were projected to get.

You only get something done if the other parties are willing to work with you. They're excluded from every possible block that could get something done.

All they do these days is whine about how unfair it is that they still don't have any power to exercise. It helps that European countries tend to not have stupidly antagonistic two-party systems.

Our right-wing extremist party didn't just fail to grab a majority. Every party in our government flat out ignores them or bands together to oppose anything they do. Well it doesn't really take any banding together since they have no majority or any allies. Mostly they just get laughed at. They're a puff piece in the news anytime they take the floor.

satanismyhomeboy,beer,,"Hi. Also looking for advice on the break up and how to get over her- especially since she’s in town this week and I still secretly love her. Apologies for the long post but there's some back story here including cops almost getting involved towards the end of our relationship 5 months ago.

The long and short of it is that my ex used my card (probably auto populated on her computer from previous purchases we made) to buy dominos in January and again yesterday. I know it was her because she goes to school in the same town as the dominos in another state.

I noticed yesterday and am pretty mad about it. I have been contemplating telling her ""hey, X I don't know if you did this on purpose or by accident but please stop or else i'll have to get my card company and cops involved"" OR having my sister tell her to stop and send her the money ($40). I don't care for it but my sister thinks it's a matter of principle and wants the ex to venmo her the money. OR My friend thinks i should call the cops of that town and get her arrested for fraud which is pretty aggressive considering she's going to law school next semester. OR Call her father to tell him what she's done.

Here's our back story - met summer 2015 - we both thought it was a fling at first and then just realized we were crazy about each other. She goes to school (undergrad) 3 hours away but we managed to see each other almost every other weekend throughout the entire relationship and during her breaks. I even visited her in Europe while she studied abroad.

We had our fair share of issues with other guys and girls confessing their love for us and one girl even tap kissing me on the lips. I told her about it- probably shouldn't of because it made the relationship worse. She's a very attractive blue eyed blond and i'm a hispanic guy which she's very attracted to because she's taken 10 years of spanish and speaks it fluently and is even going to law school next in Miami which I introduced her to on an anniversary trip (still bitter about it since I had introduced her to courses that helped her LSAT scores go up after she didn't do well her first time).

Earlier 2017 and we both blacked out on separate occasions - said mean, rude, and hurtful things and broke up with eachother. Neither of us remembered breaking up with one another and the relationship became sour but we still loved eachother.

Fast forward to September, she finds my reddit account i've had for 4 years and sees two comments I left on gonewild ""nice tits"" and ""are there any more pics"". She felt like I had cheated on her. We went on a break for 3 weeks before she finally broke up with me over a text. She told my friends girlfriends I was some sort of online perv having relationships with women on the internet. (I'm still great friends with all of them and they all put it in the past and believe my side of the story). I was livid that that's how she chose to end our relationship. She ignored me for days until she eventually texted me to move on and said she cheated on me with a guy that was a problem in our relationship. I told her i'm not surprised and she's just like her mother (huge blow because her mom walked out on her family after cheating on her father). She deleted me off every form of social media. She later emailed me saying she was joking about it and it was just to get me mad. I pleaded a little bit more to stay together but gave up that night. Fast forward 3 weeks and a girl messages on facebook to let me know my ""girlfriend"" was cheating on me with her boyfriend. I told her we broke up months ago. My ex immediately called me to yell at me to stop talking to this crazy ex of the guy she met after the break up. I believe her because the guy lived in my state and she said they met over her winter break.

A month later i sent her dad a godfather dvd I had gotten him for christmas months earlier since I knew he loved them along with a nice little ""thank you for everything"" letter. Her step mom called my mom to tell her i'm being crazy and that she thinks i sent them a bomb (the stepmom never agreed of our relationship because of the age difference- the dad was kind of understanding but not fully onboard either). She told my mom that my ex didn't feel safe and that they would get the cops involved if i try contacting them again (her stepmom is a pathological liar so i'm sure most of that was a lie). This was in November. I ran into her at a bar in January when she was back in town for break. I saw her leave and went to say hi and apologize but she looked at me said ""wow"" and got in her uber. Haven't heard or seen her since.

I've slept with a few women since her and have traveled abroad twice for a week each since the break up but still think about her EVERY.SINGLE.DAY. I picked up hobbies like hitting the gym and meditation and listening to podcast but it only helps so much.

I'm not sure how to proceed. It's infuriating to have her come back into my life in such a shitty way. I see she used my card a few days after that encounter in January and again 2 days ago. Which was my birthday.

tl;dr: ex behaved shitty during the break up. really broke my heart and drove me mad. now she's using my card. May be an accidident. May be her playing mind games. I could ruin her or let this go..",True,0,1520007675,,False,0,dv2rk1o,False,t3_81f4x2,True,t3_81f4x2,/r/Drama/comments/81f4x2/pizza/dv2rk1o/,1524739724,1,True,False,Drama,t5_2rd2l,public,

TE-toimistojen, ELY ja Aluekeskusten [toiminnat yhdistetään](http://alueuudistus.fi/tehtavat) maakuntien olemassaoleviin vastuisiin.

Eli käytännössä tarkoittaa sitä, että kun esimerkiksi Tampereella halutaan johonkin EU-rahoituskelpoiseen projektiin kyhnyä, niin sitä ei tarvitse Vaasasta asti mennä kyselemään.

Article:

a) The personal story of Larsy and how he bought the team.


b) 

""We know that we will be in the playoffs this year. The question is however if we can make a step forward, so we can become more competitive the next two years and be able to win a championship. We try to win now and we do it as you can see. The important thing is to continue our progress as a team and reach the level we want. ""

"" I think we need more depth on the second unit. I think we also need one more shooter. Right now we have 3 amazing players: Giannis, Khris, Aqua that are learning to play together. We also have Jabari, so we have 4 amazing players. The problem with Jabari is his injuries. If he can play well, it will be great for the team. The progress of the team is obvious compared to 1 or 2 years ago. We give a lot of emphasis on the new court, we have already built a new gym and we are looking at players we can bring.""

""I don't think it's hard to persuade anyone. The athlete that will come to Milwaukee is the athlete that wants to win. It's something we ve seen happening with OC which has a small market as well. The important thing is to work and do good choices on the draft"". Giannis is building a good fame and people will want to play with him. I believe he will say a few good words and there will be very few people that will deny our proposals.""

""There is a lot of tarent in Europe. Players are ready when they are 18-19 year olds compared to the Americans that come from NCAA to NBA. We are looking at your young players as well and trying to find good choices. You need to be lucky during the draft. Giannis was the 15th choice, but if you look at the draft now he should be number 1. We are trying to grow our European scouting team as we speak.""

c)

""What is happening is marvelous. We want to be in contact with our fans and what Giannis is doing helps us a lot. He is our ambassador and it's wonderful to have an athlete that everybody loves. Think about it, he came second at the old star voting. Greece is an important market for us since we have a Greek superstar. We have to cooperate with him to see what we can do to grow our relationship with Greece even more. ""

""I will tell you a beautiful story. I said in the past that i will give the opportunity to two people to travel with me from New York to Milwaukee, watch the games and meet Giannis. The money from the auction would go to a charity. Usually these auctions reach about 2.000 dollars. This time two Greek families were bidding one after the other and the winner gave 30.000. I felt so bad for the family that didn't win despite offering 29.000 that i took both families with me. And Giannis couldn't behave better. He was wonderful. I know many Greek interpreneurs and even people that i ve never met that call me and ask to get them in contact with Giannis.""

""It's very difficult to organize games in Greece. The least we can do is try tho. It's something i 'd really like to do. I would be wonderful to play outside and not in a stadium as well.""

""We and the Greek National Association had different opinions. We were worried about Giannis because his knee was hurting. The only thing that could help him was rest. We knew that he wouldn't need any kind of surgery. I don't accuse them(GNA) for anything tho. It's hard to lose one of your superstars. If i was in his position i would want to play as well. Giannis wants to do the best for his team. He is in a lot of pressure because he is connected with Greece.""

In this case the region is the European Union. We could say that the Commonwealth of the Independent States might aswell count as an economic region. There are other examples too. 

An economy refers to a region with a clear set of rules and boundaries for ""the production and consumption of goods and services and the supply of money"". Usually its a nation, but there are a lot of examples when nations or counties form a bigger economy with the help of harmonized regulations, laws, etc.

AnnalsPornographie,moderator,Moderator | Pornography &amp; Obscenity | History of Privacy,"Thanks for tagging me in this! I agree that this has been a little back and forth hobby of ours, and I think this is a really fantastic reply that gets at the heart of these questions. I’ve definitely learned a lot from your comments, and from the sources that you’ve recommended I read. There is definitely some editing that the earlier comments could use. McKeon informs some of my opinion for sure, but I am also drawing here from Ingram, Addy, and architectural historians. 


I also would treat Habermas’ idea that the private/public spheres are essentially new ideas that could out of seventeenth-century England with great skepticism (though some things are worth saving from his theory)—indeed, there is a definite line of evolution from classical Greek thought that divided the polis and the oikos (which I’m not going to talk about here) through the middle age’s obsession with an individual’s fama (reputation) through the attempts by church courts to regulate sexual behavior, morality and proper behavior and beyond (I think you might be able to characterize the societal obsessions over masturbation and pornography into this umbrella). 


As I’ve mentioned to you elsewhere, the issue for me comes down to private versus capital-P Privacy concepts. I think we agree that there is no necessary platonic idea of Privacy that has existed and exists in all human societies and places at all times, or that it means the same things in all societies. And we would both agree that privacy is historically and culturally constructed, and has different manifestations and associations attached to it—the cloistering privacy of a monk is not the same thing as the personal prayer-chamber of an upper class woman in Geneva or London.

The reason why I think you can reasonably say that there is an “invention of [capital P] privacy” is that I think the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries marked a pretty major break with earlier tradition. Of course, this break could also be seen as just a part of the evolution, and I wouldn’t die on that hill, but there is a fundamental change to European life that begins in the sixteenth century, expands massively in the seventeenth, and gets quantum-accelerated rocket boosters beyond that—the process of the rural life emptying into the cities. Your point that the “history of sex in the Middle Ages is a history of people finding places to have sex” is absolutely right—they did it in the churches, the fields, the haymarkets and lofts.But the point of the church courts is that sex and sexuality were much more socially controlled and regulated. 

We do have to be careful using this source material, as you point out, because it doesn’t necessarily represent all behavior in all places and it only focused on situations that were seen as particularly egregious or bad, but in a large amount of the cases mentioned in Ingram and the ones I have personally read, there was a long-term community awareness and gossip about the behavior of their members. Young women's and men's sexuality (and everyone else's) was subject to investigation, reporting, shaming and in extreme cases, church court legislation. This was the established social compact, and it was enforced through gossip, shame, and sometimes even more forcefully. 

I don’t think it is possible to have real Privacy in the sense of our modern (and legal) concepts of it while under constant observation and investigation from members of the community, servants, and other people. The process of the sixteenth century and beyond is the process of creating a protected and secure space for the family and the individuals further and further away from prying eyes. Bedrooms moved from being sites of social activity to private spaces. The architecture of buildings changed *hugely* during this period, first with the “invention of the upstairs” and then with the creation of the hallway and corridor. These are some of the things McKeon draws on, which is why when you say

&gt; Well, McKeon discovered what countless other European historians have: the fastest way to get a group of scholars to dismantle the foundations of your argument is to argue to medievalists that the early modern era invented something.
I think this it somewhat unfair characterization of his work, as he does spend a good deal of discussion on the fact that he is focusing on the concepts of privacy that develop and are processed through the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth century. 


Specifically, in his first chapter:


&gt; On the one hand, the classical management of the oikos, of the household economy, was transformed into a model for the management of the greater household—that is, for “political economy”—whose implications were yet very different from those of the medieval analogy between the family and the state. On the other hand, the residue of this transformation—the household divested even of its economic function—became the model for the “domestic sphere.” 

The following bit is what holds the most interest for me

&gt;In the agrarian “domestic economy” characteristic of premodern England economic production was organized around the household. With the early modern capitalist revolution, however, productive labor—defined as such by the fact of its remuneration—became an activity increasingly undertaken only by men and only outside the household. That is, the private work of economic production was separated out from the private household and undertaken for the market. At the same time, the function of the household was greatly altered and augmented as it gradually became the seat of primary socialization, of Puritan discipline and gentle cultivation, through which it took on those nonprivative private values that we associate with the ethos of the domestic sphere.

The ideas of privacy and family that are created as *separate* and *different* from the culture-writ-large are, in my estimation, a break and an evolution from previous times (perhaps the punctuated equilibrium theory of history?). And they come from huge and fundamental shifts in the way of living that are a break with classical and medieval times. Perhaps the break is not as dramatic as I would have it, but I don't think it's as smooth, gradual, or simple as some theorists would have it.

Either way, I come to the same conclusion as you that we should be thinking historically, we should not be assuming that our current conceptions and ideas of privacy are historically eternal: privacy has shifted before and will shift again—and perhaps we are seeing that with Facebook, Google, and Big Data creeping on every aspect of our existence.

Alliances, declarations of war, trade agreements, treaties, and all other binding agreements with foreign bodies go through Congress.

People trade because it's in their best interest to do so economically, not because they like the guy someone else elected and decide to do them a favor. Trump doesn't change the relative benefit of the steel trade, especially since, again, the power to control tariffs (or lack thereof) lies with Congress and not the executive.

&gt; Because he would shoot you in the foot by tarriffing US steel imports- destroying the industry based around it. And EVERYONE uses steel.

Again, Trump can't tariff anything. All he can do is sign a piece of paper given to him by Congress. 

&gt; You're literally saying the president isn't important to the world. 

The president is only important to people who virtue signal. Even when a relatively radical Democrat like Obama had a fully cooperative Supreme Court, Senate, *and* House, functional interactions with the rest of the world didn't change a lick from when Bush was in power. Sure, he went off and embarrassed everyone apologizing for shit, but despite sensational right-wing news reports, that didn't *do* anything, and neither does Trump running off at the mouth like an idiot. Geopolitics is bigger than one man, especially when he's just a president and *not* an absolute ruler. The only thing Trump does is invite disdain from random people in other countries, and it's no disdain they didn't already feel. I didn't care what Europeans thought of our relatively free markets or relatively unrestricted firearms before, and I don't care what they think now, because unless they feel like marching to war over it, they have no power to affect my rights, and trade is in their *own* best interests.

drylaw,southamerica,New Spain | Colonial India,"**II. The Mexican case**

Colonial Mexico was no exception to this sale and purchase of offices. As becomes clear in the above quote, where a viceroy complains of the abuse of tax collectors. More generally the administration increased as well due to these sales. We also know of Viceroys being appointed in the 17th century in return for financial servies to the Crown. In my readings on native communities of this time, I also come across similiar allegations of abuses on a more local level. By the late 16th century, native communities started being headed increasingly by Spaniards, creoles or other groups. Traditionally these *cacicazgos* had still been passed on in noble native families (similar to pre-hispanic times), but by this time judicial changes in the status of natives and mestizos meant that non-natives increasingly purchased such positions. In these cases, the communites or the former native caciques would often complain of abuses, with the new caciques levying too heavy taxes or tributes (sometimes such allegations would also be levied against native caciques). This shows that the sale of offices was not just restricted to the colonial administration, but also increasingly played a role local communities.

William Connell discusses an interesting case that goes in a slightly different direction. In the late 17th century, the audiencia (appelate court) of Mexico City asked that the upcoming municiap elections be supervised. They stated that the governor and his tax collector manipulated voters, and generally abused native people.

&gt; ...at least according to some residents, the Native governments in Mexico Tenochtitlan worked against the Native peoples residing in these neighborhoods. Allegations of abuse, of mistreatment, and ultimately of officeholders using the authority of their positions to enrich themselves all suggest that governors and their allies may have engaged in what the Native residents of the city, other Native peoples, and European law would have regarded as illicit and corrupt acitvity. [...] In Mexico Tenochtitlan the Native leaders increasingly competed with poltical rivals for office, and those who lost an election often complained to the viceregal government, elleging illegal practices. Modern observers would call these practices *corruption* even though the authors of the documents recording these complaints did not use this term specifically.

First this shows that (alleged) abuse or corruption occured not between various groups (like Spaniards or native), but could also be carried out for example from native elites against native commoners. Second, it again raises the question of what was considered corruption at the time - the term was not used here, but it was in other contexts.

----------------

I'm more familiar with the colonial context, but will still try and look at some parallels between colonial and modern times. We've seen above the influence of sales of offices in both Spanish America and colonial Mexico; which were increasingly seen as a form of corruption. One problem with comparing this modern-day corruption are the various ""upheavals"" in Mexican history: Among many others we have here independence, the Porfiriato, the Mexican revolution... all leading to major political and social transformation. Nonetheless it's clear that Mexico (as other Latin American countries) has corruption deeply entranched within its political system.

Stephen Morris makes a connection here more explicit:

&gt; A cursory glance into the past suggests that the pervasiveness of corruption in Mexico is not a recent phenomenon. Eric Wolf acknowledges widespread corruption during Mexico's colonial epoch, associating it with the formal and informal discrimiatory barriers that confronted the growing mestizo population; Lucas Alemán refers to the corrupt privilges enjoyed by the Mexican military during the middle of the 19th century; and Alan Knight and Paul J. Venderwood highlight the common practice of ""converting"" bandits into police during pre- and postrevolutionary periods. President Alvaro Obregón  (1920-24) publicly acknowledged the tactical use of corruption ...; and President Miguel Alemán Valdés (1946-52) left a world-renowned legacy of corruption and ollgotten gain.

To these various examples I would add land reforms and the increase of huge land holdings beyond the colonial period as another factor here. While native communities had held certain rights to traditional lands in colonial times, this status was no longer recognized post-independence. Large swathes of formerly native lands were thus sold off during the republic, influencing the increasing formation of latifundia. This trend was expanded with reforms during the Porfiriato, and only challenged after the revolution. So we have here another factor with huge latifundias ennabling further corruption.

How all such trends can be compared to post-revolutionary Mexico is hard to say. While Morris highlight the ""antiquity"" of Mexican corruption, he also ties its current form to post-revolutionary developments. He especially focuses on the entranchment of corruption in the PRI's system of governance. For him 

&gt; corruption in Mexico stems from a structural imbalance of state and social forces that effectively grants the Mexican state and its represantitives a virtual monopoly over opportunities for wealth and mobility. This strucutral asymmetry forments a particular pattern of corrupt behavious characterized by widespread extortion. [...] Control over recruitment in the vast Mexican public sector resides with the top political elite in the PRI and the government. Few alternative poles attracting talent and inspiring loyalty in the public sector compete with the centralized control of the party and the bureacracy. Only one route to social advancement within the state is available. As a result, most employees of the government are dependant on their good standing in the party or among upper level officials for any opportunities for mobility. 

Now Morris' book came out in 1991, so before the PRI was deselected in 2000; but his points still seem valid more generally regading Mexico's political system. They show clearly the centralitiy of a bureacuracy that is strongly controlled by the ruling party, and in connection with the party's monopoly forments further corruption.

--------------

This is getting a bit rambling, so I'll close by summing up a few points: The sale of offices was certainly an important part of both Spanish America and colonial Mexico, and was increasingly seen as a form of corruption at the time. There were many influences of colonial structures on independent Mexico, including land ownership and the administration's important role. And that the earlier (colonial) forms of corruption can be seen as establishing patterns in Mexico (and more generally many Latin America countries) of which consequences can be seen in the more ""developed"", modern-day forms of corruption entranched within its political system.

&gt;**Pastor de São José dos Campos (SP) simulou o próprio sequestro e, segundo a polícia, pediu resgate em bitcoins. Em vídeo ele agradece pela corrente de orações enquanto estava 'desaparecido'.**  


&gt; Após forjar o próprio sequestro, o pastor evangélico Alexandre Geraldo dos Anjos publicou um vídeo em uma rede social para agradecer a oração dos fiéis enquanto estava 'desaparecido'. Nesta quinta-feira (1º) ele se apresentou à polícia na delegacia de Igaratá e disse que tinha sido sequestrado, mas conseguiu fugir do cativeiro. Ele também contou, segundo o delegado Neimar Camargo, que pediu como resgate três bitcoins – cada um vale cerca de R$ 35 mil na cotação desta sexta (2). Ele não comentou a acusação da polícia sobre a fraude no sequestro - pelo qual ele deve responder em liberdade pelo crime de estelionato. O irmão, Leandro Geraldo dos Anjos, conta que a família não sabia que o religioso passava por problemas financeiros e que o sequestro seria uma farsa. “A Assembleia de Deus Missão em São José dos Campos esclarece que Alexandre Geraldo dos Anjos não é pastor ou membro do ministério desta igreja”, informou por nota. Segundo a Polícia Civil, eles desconfiaram da versão do suposto sequestro depois que receberam uma denúncia de que Alexandre teria sido visto em um restaurante em Jacareí na última quarta-feira (28).

The Martin Model 167 is a twin-engined, all metal monoplane American medium bomber, developed by the Glenn L. Martin company in the late 1930s. Although the success of DB-7 prevented the aircraft to enter service with U.S. forces, it soon found its way to war-torn Europe, where it faithfully served with nations like France and the UK until the end of the war. Pilots may expect the Martin 167 A3 to reinforce the ranks of the Armée de l'Air in the upcoming update 1.77 “Advancing Storm”!The Martin Model 167 medium bomber was developed as a response to a set of requirements issued by the USAAC in 1938. Following these requirements, Martin developed its Model 167 bomber, which received its official testing designation of XA-22. However, despite showing favorable performance, the XA-22 lost out to the Douglas DB-7 (which became A-20 Havoc) during the competition, which resulted in Douglas getting the contract with the USAAC. What would usually spell disaster for most projects that suffered a fate like this, turned out to not to be the case for Martin’s design. With an armed conflict looming over Europe, nations such as France and the UK were desperately stocking up with any military equipment that was on offer, including aircraft. France in particular was looking into buying any available aircraft from manufacturers abroad as the domestic production was limited. These manufacturers were in many cases American companies, just like Martin. In any case, the first orders for French export versions of Martin’s new bomber soon came in, effectively sparing the project from ruin.The Martin 167-A3 will make its way to the first rank of the French air forces tree with the upcoming update 1.77 “Advancing Storm”. Be sure to stay tuned to the news to stay up to date with the latest developments for War Thunder’s next major update. Until then, pilots!For more information, read the full Dev Blog article on the Official War Thunder Forums!

For most of history, trying to group say, the Romans and the Celts into the same ethnic group based solely on pale skin would be considered lunacy. In order to allow for race-based oppression of people from Africa by people from Europe, we had to first create social grouping to separate them, and ""white"" was one of the groupings that came out of that. It's not a term that has any real meaning without the history of race-based oppression behind it as it's not like ""white"" people and ""white"" cultures have much in common beyond that. You can see that in the ever changing understanding of who is white and who is not (the Irish, the ""one drop"" rule and ""blood quantum"" for biracial people) which track more with social and economic expediency than with cultural similarities.",True,0,1520015074,,False,0,dv2zksk,False,t3_81f5xz,False,t1_dv2u888,/r/CanadaPolitics/comments/81f5xz/antiwhiteness_canadian_university_event_mired_in/dv2zksk/,1524743567,32,True,False,CanadaPolitics,t5_2s4gt,public,

Teams that have less to play for are more unpredictable because they don't have the same predictable motivations. Maybe they'll rotate and players will play for the shop window or young players will make their claim or they simply won't care as much and play worse. Then there are teams fighting for their life.

PoppinKREAM,,,"Hi there, you claimed this Russia story was a desperate obsession, implying that it is being overblown. But you never responded to the evidence I provided that Russian interference into the American election was not a hoax. Special Counsel Mueller's indictment of 13 Russian Nationals and 3 Russian Companies would have something else to say about that. 

These were your words;

&gt;The Russian bot obsession has passed from funny and desperate to worrying. Eventually they will be able to shut down all opposing view points by saying two simple words.

The Russian disinformation campaign continues while the current administration refuses to act upon a real threat, President Trump has failed to give instructions to the NSA to disrupt Russian election meddling.^[[1]](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/27/trump-russia-meddling-mike-rogers) They have a long history of promoting disinformation campaigns in an attempt to destabilize the West and America, there is historical precedence.^[[2]](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/12/us/politics/russian-disinformation-aids-fake-news.html) The parallels between what is happening now and what occurred in Ukraine in 2014 are uncanny in nature and should worry every sane American and Westerner.^[[3]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/inside-a-russian-disinformation-campaign-in-ukraine-in-2014/2017/12/25/f55b0408-e71d-11e7-ab50-621fe0588340_story.html?utm_term=.f20b9d1d4710)

This was an extremely sophisticated operation, I recommend reading the indictment as it is only 37 pages long, below I have included a few excerpts.^[[4]](https://www.justice.gov/file/1035477/download) They bought political ads on social media in the names of US persons. All of this was funded through Russian fronts, including a catering company run by a Russian national known as ""Putin's chef"". Prigozhin has been Putin's go to guy for under the table missions, including recruiting mercenaries for the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria.^[[5]](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/world/europe/prigozhin-russia-indictment-mueller.html) We just found out that Prigozhin gave the go ahead for Assad forces and Russian mercenaries to attack a US base in Syria a few weeks ago.^[[7]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/putin-ally-said-to-be-in-touch-with-kremlin-assad-before-his-mercenaries-attacked-us-troops/2018/02/22/f4ef050c-1781-11e8-8b08-027a6ccb38eb_story.html?utm_term=.d1afa2db0fbf)

Russian operatives used stolen US identities, travelled across 9 states collecting intelligence, discussed escape routes if they were caught inside the country, bought equipment including burner phones/SIM cards. This operation included hundreds of employees conducting information warfare during the election, it was funded with millions of dollars from the Kremlin. 


&gt;**Object of the Conspiracy;**

&gt; 28.. The conspiracy had as its object impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful government functions of the United States by dishonest means in order to enable the Defendants to interfere with US political and electoral processes, including the 2016 US presidential election.  

&gt;**Manner and Means of the Conspiracy:**

&gt; 29.. Starting at least in or around 2014, Defendants and their co-conspirators began to track and study groups on US social media sites dedicated to US politics and social issues. In order to gauge the performance of various groups on social media sites, the ORGANIZATION tracked certain metrics like the group's size, the frequency of content places by the group, and the level of audience engagement with that content, such as the average number of comments or responses to  a post. 



&gt;a. KRYLOVA and BOGACHEVA, together with other defendants and co-conspirators, planned travel itineraries, purchases equipment (such as cameras, SIM cards, and drop phones), and discussed security measures (including ""evacuation scenarios"") for Defendants who traveled to the United States. 


&gt;**Use of US Social Media Platforms**

&gt;32.. Defendants and their co-conspirators, through fraud and deceit, created hundres of social media accounts and used them to develop certain fictitious US personas into ""leader[s] of public opinion"" in the United States. 

&gt;**Use of US Computer Infrastructure**

&gt;39.. To hide their Russian identities and ORGANIZATION affiliation, Defendants and their co-conspirators - particularly POLOZOV and the ORGANIZATION's IT department - purchases space on computer servers located inside the United States in order to set up virtual private networks (""VPNs""). Defendants and their co-conspirators connected from Russia to the US based infrastructure by way of these VPNs and conducted activity inside the United Sates - including accessing online social media accounts, opening new accounts, and communicated with real US persons - while masking the Russian origin and control of the activity. 

&gt;40.. Defendants and their co-conspirators also registered and controlled hundreds of web-based email accounts hosted by US email providers under false names so as to appear to be US persons and groups. From these accounts, Defendants and their co-conspirators registered or linked to online social media accounts in order to monitor them; posed as US persons when requesting assistance from real US persons; contacted media outlets in order to promote activities inside the United States; and conducted other operations, such as those set forth below. 

&gt;**Use of Stolen US Identities**

&gt;41.. In or around 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators also uses, possessed, and transferred, without lawful authority, the social security numbers and dates of birth of real US persons without those persons' knowledge or consent. Using these means of identification, Defendants and their co-conspirators opened accounts at PayPal, a digital payment service provider; created false means of identification, including fake driver's licenses; and posted on ORGANIZATION - controlled social media accounts using the identities of these US victims. 

&gt;**Actions Targeting the 2016 US Presidential Election**

&gt;42.. By approximately May 2014, Defendants and their co-conspirators discussed efforts to interfere in the 2016 US presidential election. Defendants and their co-conspirators began to monitor US social media accounts and other sources of information about the 2016 US presidential election. 

&gt;43.. By 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators used their fictitious online personas to interfere with the 2016 US presidential election. They engaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump. 

&gt;45.. Defendants and their co-conspirators also used false US personas to communicate with unwitting members, volunteers, and supporters of the Trump Campaign involved in local community outreach, as well as grassroots groups that supported then-candidate Trump. These individuals and entities at times distributed the ORGANIZATION's materials through their own accounts via retweets, reposts, and similar means. Defendants and their co-conspirators then monitored the propagation of content through such participants. 

&gt;46.. In or around the latter half of 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators, through their ORGANIZATION-controlled personas, began to encourage US minority groups not to vote in the 2016 US presidential election or to vote for a third-party US presidential candidate. 

&gt;47.. Starting in or around the summer of 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators also began to promote allegations of voter fraud by the Democratic Party through their fictitious US personas and groups on social media. Defendants and their co-conspirators purchased advertisements on Facebook to further promote the allegations. 

&gt;**Political Advertisements**

&gt;48.. From at least April 2016 through November 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators, while concealing their Russian identities and ORGANIZATION affiliation through false personas, began to produce, purchase, and post advertisements on US social media and other online sites expressly advocating for the election of then-candidate Trump or expressly opposing Clinton. Defendants and their co-conspirators did not report their expenditures to the Federal Election Commission, or register as foreign agents with the US Department of Justice.

But, having spent time in Europe and the UK, I get why your questioning this.  Most kids have a 'gap year' or take some time to 'find themselves' or rely on their parents a bit more.  My takeaway is the family is more emphasized in Europe as a cohesive unit, much more so than in the States, well a 'traditional family' anyhow.  

My husband when growing up was allowed to return to his mom's house when going back to school and when he needed a bit of support.  I recall my own grandma was the same way with her kids and some grandkids, they were allowed to stay in the home for short periods of time to get their ground back, but kicked out if they couldn't get it together after a bit.

As for consumer confusion, I don't think that's persuasive:

When you buy Champagne do you expect it to have come from Champagne France? 

What about Parmesan? Do you expect it to have come from Parma \*Italy? 

In the EU these words are protected, in the US they aren't but it's really trivial to get the appropriate product (e.g. one will say product of Parma Italy, the other won't). 

In the US almondmilk can't be called ""almond (space) milk"" because of the dairy industry but I really doubt there's any confusion in the market considering that the typical almondmilk label is *super duper clear that there's no dairy in the product* and that would not suddenly stop being true if they could insert a space into the generic product name. 

The market for lab meat is such that they'd be *super duper clear* that no animal was harmed, so consumer confusion is almost certainly not the issue. 

Requiring this product to be called ""meet"" or whatever is (charitably) to protect entrenched interests, or (uncharitably) to make it easier to smear as unnatural. 

Whether those entrenched interests deserve or require protection isn't something I have a definite opinion on; but that's what the discussion is actually about.

Tobacco is not a bad one and has health benefits, but Europeans can smoke like chimneys so I imagine it may not be popular. Targeting trumpets is somewhat hard. Trump areas are the poorer areas of the US. There is a lot of agriculture, but the EU is largely protectionist here to protect its own farmers. Trump areas also have the older type manufacturing and I think this is less protectionist and is traded more free. The problem here is European manufacturing is on par or ahead of US manufacturing in many areas and Europe exports more than vice versa. 

I would actually love if Europe hit trumpets hard but it is going to hit Europe harder. Also US has one big advantage of being a united political entity. Tradewise it is close to equal trade, but on a per country basis it is not equal. It could cause a lot of tension among members about who is paying more for this. The problem is the EU runs a $100 billion surplus of trade against the US but a large part of that is Germany, with Italy as a distant second, and France/Netherlands as a distant 3rd. 

honestly the best approach is probably just to get trump on a 1 and 1 and just convince him that China is the enemy and the US/Europe/Canada/Japan are friends. I bet he would go for it and this whole thing can be avoided.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-19/rusal-is-said-to-plan-first-woman-ceo-as-deripaska-steps-down

&gt; **Billionaire Oleg Deripaska is stepping down as president of Rusal and En+ Group Plc** as part of a broader reshuffle, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the appointments will be announced after the Rusal board meets **Feb. 22**. En+ CEO Maxim Sokov will take the role as president of En+ and Rusal CEO Vladislav Soloviev will become CEO of En+.

**This has likely nothing to do with Trump's hair brain Tariff War** (that likely caught Putin off guard as well). 

I think Deripaska is being punished by Putin for his indiscrete handling of the [Nastya Rybka debacle](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-instagram-model-secrets-trump-20180228-story.html), which tentatively links Manafort (and Trump) to the Kremlin by way of Deripaska and Deputy Prime Minister Sergey Prikhodko.



**About the Tariff War**: I have a crazy gut feeling Trumps' ""plan"" isn't about China, Europe or Canada/Mexico, but squarely aimed at Putin (and his steel/aluminium oligarchs) as retaliation for ['nuking' Mar-a-Lago](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/01/europe/putin-nuclear-missile-video-florida/index.html).

tengachi10001,,,"&gt; Official history to everyon in Serbia you wanted to wright?

You got to be trolling at this point. You're literally trying to disprove the official history which is taught the same in Turkey, in Serbia and everywhere else in the world.

&gt; Croatia and Croats were always here and will be always here. Only you Serbs have issue with that. You are a people that ceased to be long a go in the middle ages, yet a few surviwed and kept the xenophopic serbian nationalism alive even to this day. Yet, you don't have a language of your own or your own culture so you proclaim everything Croatian serbian. Evern our blood. You sicken me.

See, you got triggered hard on this one, as expected. And yet you showed off your real colors now, literally talking what I did but reversed. And you don't have a **single** proof about the bullshit you're spouting above (that we ceased to exist long time ago and that we don't have a language on our own). Figures.

&gt; No they don't, my boy. I was refering to the studies I linked to, about Croats, not imaginary studies you refer to now. You only posted one about the Serbs.

That study is as ""imaginary"" as the ones you posted. And none of them showed anything what you claimed so far.

&gt; Here's a more politicaly correct summary of the Serbian case:

&gt; http://i.imgur.com/x2xqQQR.png

I see Eupedia down there, are you suddenly claiming it is reliable now? Provide a source for it. Is it officially from Eupedia or not? Who made that image? On what study/studies it is based upon? How it is more ""politically correct""? Many questions to answer there, but I know I won't get any proper answer, which demonstrates a pure hypocrisy from your side since you claim what you posted above is somehow correct, and what I posted isn't.

&gt; Which others, I only offered one other? Can't you count? Or did you just mix something up?

&gt; Other studies about Croats show the same pattern, some give results like the first, others like the second. But they aren't reliable since if they were would give a lot more similar results.

Yes I can, and I counted two of yours, one of mine and Eupedia. All of them, except the one with low confidence levels, showed very similar results to each others.

&gt; You (Serbs) have almost half of Slavic plus everything else

We have more than half of Slavic as evidenced by the studies, no matter how much you repeat that lie.

&gt; Contrary to you, I actually have certified higher education with statistics and variability.

It appears you don't. 

&gt; Try dividing 35 with 20, then supstracing 1 and mutlipling the result with 100. You get 75% difference. See, it was easy - if you'r educated :P

See? That's not how you count difference in percentages. You're embarrassing yourself. Get back to elementary school material.

&gt; There is zero issue with regions in the study, but then again you claim to have read them.

There is apparently an issue, confidence levels are emphasized as low. And confidence levels are based on what I've said - regions and their sample sizes. Can you use logic for once?

&gt; The studies are about Croats. Again and again, ** you don't read**.

No, one of them you posted was about the whole ex-Yugoslavia area. And ultimately you accuse me that I don't read. Ridiculous.

&gt; And Serbs have less than 50% Slavic.

Proofs for that are **still** nowhere to be seen. Sigh.

&gt; Yeah, I'm the one who's comments stem from mythomania. Riiight.

The only mythomania is coming from you all the time since it's not backed up by any historical nor scientific facts.

&gt; Only parroting is coming from you, you keep going on and on about the studies, I keep telling you they are unriliable and give different reuslts each time. The studies I posted were posted to support that argument.

Apparently they don't, even the one you posted which shows different numbers in results is explained by low confidence levels. It's you who is parroting the same non-argument about percentages yet you don't take into account the factors which made that one study to differ from the others regarding your results - from there it comes the argument about your higher heterogeneity.

&gt; And I keep telling you that they don't have any drastic conclusions because they are unrialible.

&gt; Period.

Wrong. They don't have drastic conclusions not because they're ""unreliable"" but because they exercise expected results and are aligned in their conclusions, not because of some imagined conspiracy in your head but because that's how it is no matter what study you pick. None of the studies deny history or common sense, only you are doing that.

&gt; Well, maybe the history from serbian history books that's blatantly rasist, calling Croats Serbs.

No, it isn't.

&gt; I understand your point, but if you did that I wouldn't fret about it, I would just call it what it is - lies and mythomany.

So why you are doing it then right now? Do you admit you spread lies and myths? No? Then why are you stuck to something you can never prove?

&gt; And I voiced it and it's an opinion. Big Fucking Deal.

Yes, it's an opinion. A malicious one, backed up by nothing **at all**.

&gt; No, balkan is the sam thing as nigger, a racist word made up by ""Elites"" that hate the people living in the so called region. You seem to like it perfectly.

Whatever floats your boat. I don't see Balkan being much different from other divisions of Europe.

&gt; Serbs or Serbia were newer Antemurale Christianitatis

Why does that matter for anything? It was used to strengthen your morale.

&gt; And that just happened, how did you think Bosniak/Muslims came to be, ha pal?

The same how Serbs came to be Catholics/Croats.

&gt; You didn't get any lands exchanged for anything in Military Froniter. That's just typical serbian historic fabrications and mythomany.

No, Serbs got offered those lands in exchange to defend them. They were since then living there for centuries.

&gt; Military Frontier were Croatian Crown Lands under direct military rule, as opposed to rest of Croatia where typical everyday life of the time occured.

It was under Croatian control at first, but that lasted for less time than you imagine it to be. From 1627 all the way up to abolition it was under direct Hapsburg control.

&gt; The only way Serbs got there was as forefront of Turkish pillage and attacks on Croatia. Then they settled in the areas that they pillaged and destroyed. Later, having the need for people to fight the same Turks that brought them to Croatia they were even accepted to live there as nothing happened.

No, Janissaries pillaged Croatia, and since Austria-Hungary was greatly weakened from it, the Habsburgs invited Serbs to relocate along the borders to defend them from intrusions. And they settled there, repulsing Ottoman attacks for centuries to come.

Kross_B,,,"Theresa May’s speech at Mansion House today was the most considered and conciliatory of the three set piece orations she has given on Brexit.

She was realistic, in a way she has not been before, about the trade-offs and compromises that the government will have to make as it tries to forge a deal with the EU. And the speech has already received a positive response from Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, who praised it for its “clarity”. 

But on an initial read, it is hard to see how her words will help advance the second phase of Brexit negotiations. None of the fundamental concerns that the EU has raised about protecting the integrity of the single market have been allayed.

There is a section of Mrs May’s speech with the headline: “Facing up to some hard facts.” Arguably, that is what the oration does best. After a long period in which the prime minister talked, somewhat dreamily, about wanting a “deep and special partnership”, she finally acknowledges reality. “Our access to each other’s markets will be less than it is now.”

The prime minister accepts that, even after the UK has left “the jurisdiction of the ECJ, EU law and the decisions of the ECJ will continue to affect us.”

She acknowledges, too, that if the UK agrees to participate in an EU agency, and here she singles out chemicals, medicines and aerospace, the UK would have to respect the remit of the ECJ in that regard.

“There is a lot of detail that makes you feel that the government is being more sensible, talking more openly about the challenges,” says Mujtaba Rahman of Eurasia Group, a consultancy. “But none of the EU’s fundamental problems have been addressed. How do they ensure a level playing field? How do they protect the EU from unfair competition?”

Pro-Europeans will welcome some of the commitments that Mrs May has made. Apart from her concession on the ECJ, she wants to abide by EU competition policy and the state aid regime, and maintain EU social and environmental regulations.

But in many key areas, Mrs May provided no more detail. There was no further explanation, for example, of how an invisible border can be maintained in Ireland.

Professor Jonathan Portes of the UK in a Changing Europe says perhaps the most striking feature of the speech was that it failed to make any economic case for divergence. “It was the complete triumph of the convergers from an economic and analytical point of view,” he says. “There wasn’t a single argument for why the UK would benefit from diverging from the EU in any sector. There was nothing to suggest that new free trade deals would outweigh the costs of reduced market access to the EU.”

That perhaps is one reason some commentators are already suggesting that, on a deeper reading, this speech will not go down well with the Conservative hard Brexiters. As the Labour peer Stewart Wood has tweeted: “It’s a version of a soft Brexit. If taken seriously by Brexiteer Tories, they’ll be worried.”

WikiTextBot,,,"**Mass suicides in 1945 Nazi Germany**

During the final weeks of the Third Reich and the war in Europe, many civilians, government officials and military personnel throughout Nazi Germany committed suicide. In addition to high-ranking Nazi officials like Adolf Hitler, Joseph Goebbels, Heinrich Himmler, Philipp Bouhler and Martin Bormann, many others chose  Selbstmord (German: Self-murder) rather than accept the defeat of Germany. Studies have shown that the suicides were influenced through Nazi propaganda (reaction to the suicide of Adolf Hitler), the tenets of the Nazi Party, and the anticipated reprisals following the Allied occupation of Nazi Germany. For example in April 1945, at least 1,000 Germans killed themselves and others within 72 hours as the Red Army neared the East German town of Demmin..

Title: **USA to EU - my husband threatens divorce right before I have my permanent resident visa interview. Can I still live in the USA? Can I collect child support from him even if I live in the EU?**

Original Post: 

&gt; I'm totally blindsided. This whole divorce argument happened on Facebook and he refuses to call me. I've been in the process for CR-1 consular processing since early 2017. I'm pregnant with his firstborn currently. 
&gt; 
&gt; Rather than having relationship advice... what does this mean for me legally? Do I just lose all the visa process and stay put in my country? I have been job hunting in the USA since I should be approved in just 2-3 months from now. Do not have an opportunity for a work visa, told the companies I'd have my green card soon.
&gt; 
&gt; How does the divorce work? Do we have to go back to the country we married in? Does he file in the USA?
&gt; 
&gt; If I stay in my country, how do I collect child support? 
&gt; 
&gt; All my money went to my husband and the immigration lawyer, I can't afford a divorce lawyer now. Or afford anything, really. All my belongings except for some clothes and my laptop are at his place. 
&gt; 
&gt; I don't want this to be happening, but I still need to deal with it, I guess. Any pointers in the right direction are appreciated.
&gt;

wewiusladius4,,,"&gt;Well the only person in here that seems to think Norway is making a stupid mistake, is you, and from what i can tell you're not Norwegian, so quite frankly we don't give a shit about what you think.

Go read the /r/europe thread about this. Many Norwegian gun owners oppose this. This wasn't even put to a vote. So you have no idea how many Norwegians oppose this.

&gt;You simply cannot be reasoned with. You don't even understand that even though Norway isn't America, we can still learn from America. We don't have to adapt everything they do, but we can learn from years and years of school shootings and seeing semi-automatic weapons being used in the greater majority of these, we have decided that those weapons are not fit for any civilized society, so we ban them.

And I'm telling you that legislating based on America which is a vastly different country is absolutely retarded. The majority of European countries have semi-automatics and there is no problem. The regulations are fine as it is. Your only reason for banning this is mass hysteria. There is no rational reason, full stop.

You don't determine what people can or cannot do in a ""civilized society."" Semi-automatic guns are used for hunting, sport-shooting and vermin control. Norwegians own these type of weapons and they have no problems. Again, MUH AMERICA is not a valid reason. Norway is closer to Greece culturally than it is to America. Your ban is stupid, using your same logic we should have a 200% increase on Alcohol taxes because it kills far more people and the only reason for alcohol in society is to have fun. That's it 

 
&gt;In the US though, they value the gun lobby's right to sell them weapons so they can kill school children over the lives of those school children.

Tens of millions of America own these types of guns. Rifles kill less in America than fists, knives and hammers. So yes, a blanket ban over a tiny segment of deaths is not justifiable.

standy85,EMRM,Bologna,"&gt; The war was quite clearly caused by german and austrian imperialism in the balkans and east europe.

Really? Cause I am pretty sure that the man shooting Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo def wasn't Austrian or German. In fact, it was an extremist coached by the rabidly extremist Serbian royal dynasty and its plan for a Greater Serbia (something that the Serbians are still fond of). 

&gt; The rest of imperial europe was content on their colonial holdings in africa and asia, but not germany and austria.

Translation: If Britain, Belgium and France are imperialists and enslave half of the world, it's civilising the savages/white men's burden. If your rivals do exactly the same (remember how concentration camps are a British invention, the Anglo Boer war), it's bad. Face palm.

&gt; but that doesnt hinder the fact that france would not have won without us, hence, saved.

So, you saved France from being beaten in a war with other countries. So what? How is that any different from the Franco German war of 1870? It was the same principle. Two or more than two countries resorting to violence for their shitty imperialist aims instead of settling it through peace talks.

LordBosstoss,,,"You get me wrong if you think I just love the US government and think they have the best system in the world. No, the American government constantly strips people of their rights. This is because decades of big government presidents have began stripping away at the constitution through government surveillance, drug criminalization, welfare, taxation, firearms regulations and many other unacceptable forms of authoritarianism. 

Personally I feel the US constitution is acceptable, however given the aforementioned reasons, I don’t think it’s extreme enough.

Sure you can in theory burn down my house and kill me in America. But then you will most likely get the death penalty, so should you really? I would consider that enough of an invisible hand to deter criminals.

I appreciate that a leftist is finally recognizing that an AR-15 isn’t a military rifle. However if you don’t think the American government can’t be resisted then go ask Vietnam and see what they have to say about that. It’s even more unbalanced in America. I really can’t imagine the US military having a very easy time against an armed populace 300 times there size who’ve all watched V for vendetta and Red dawn using the home field advantage.

I like how you bring up Waco and ruby ridge as examples of the fed being able to do whatever they want with no consequences. Do I have to address the elephant in the room that goes by the name Timothy McVeigh? Look I’m not saying what he did was right but it goes to show that there will always be an equal and opposite reaction.

Haha, good one, calling me a redneck. That’s really clever. Well I can be equally clever calling you a beta soy boy globalist cuck. But let’s just try to avoid the cringy buzzwords shall we?

And I’m not American either, born and raised Quebecker.

Yes I have been to Europe, I even went to one of the Islamic areas of London. This wasn’t even one of the radical parts of London which might I remind you are all too common, like lutton for example. But even then it didn’t feel like I was in England. I can’t imagine what people in these countries must face on the daily.

I’m not even going to respond to the next few paragraphs, it’s just a bunch of nihilist edge. 
Like come on, freedom is now fundamentalist? Really dude? What a fuckin guy. 

Here’s the thing we are all subject to natural law, any man made law that goes against natural law is illegitimate to mankind. That’s all I’m going to say there because we could go on for days on natural law.

A manipulative Dumbledore (the one we have in canon) would never do the kind of things which could stick to him. I know finances are not as interesting as Dark Magic, but someone playing the game would use everything to his advantage, even if it means sitting through boring budget meetings to get all the data he would need to convince the French and (wherever Durmastrang actually is) Ministries that they could ~~line their pockets~~ save a lot of gold if they closed their schools and moved education to Hogwarts instead. And the money saved could be used by the foreign Ministries to finance a wild orgy with three veela clans or that sweet villa on Rhodes (although he would phrase that differently), so of course, all the officials will see the ""benefits"" of that proposal. Dumbledore would simultaneously tour the other European countries to promote Hogwarts and then he can point out that students from all these countries are also going to Hogwarts, so anyone clinging to Durmstrang and Beauxbaton is missing out on something obviously awesome.

The Volga Germans (German: Wolgadeutsche or Russlanddeutsche, Russian: Поволжские немцы, tr. Povolzhskiye nemtsy) are ethnic Germans who colonized and historically lived along the Volga River in the region of southeastern European Russia around Saratov and to the south. Recruited as immigrants to Russia in the 18th century, they were allowed to maintain their German culture, language, traditions, and churches (Lutheran, Reformed, Catholics, Moravians, and Mennonites). In the 19th and early 20th centuries, many Volga Germans emigrated to Kansas, the Dakotas, California and other states across the western United States, as well as to Canada and South America (mainly Argentina and Brazil).

keeptrackoftime,MAL,http://myanimelist.net/profile/bdnb,"**Fate / Zero : Episode 3**

Again this episode, I was hoping for a fight to talk about, but it was just exposition once more. Retrospectively, this is making me appreciate that Stay Night has a fight in its prologue quite a bit, since it hooks you in with the action so quickly compared to this. 96 minutes in and there still haven’t really been any fights. Unfortunately, I’m getting annoyed with all of this introduction, and so my reaction today is going to seem much more negative than it really needs to. I just want them to fight, yo!

There was a lot of focus on Waver and his servant. I’m still pretty annoyed with Waver’s personality. He’s kind of whiny, and his voice actor is playing up his whiny attitude (though I’m just hearing Persona 4’s protagonist, lol), but he also thinks that he’s skilled or talented. And compared to the other masters, he’s absolutely not. I’m hoping that he winds up dying quickly and easily, realizing in his last moments that he made a mistake in underestimating the people who followed the traditions that he spurns. On the other hand, Rider still seems cool. I think his schtick might get old if it stays the same for two seasons, but for now he’s funny, and I definitely want to see how he does in battle. That’s about all I can say related to the episode without spoilers.

[Zero spoilers](/s ""I really appreciate all the plotting and planning that some of the characters are doing, especially Kirei and Kiritsugu. I had assumed last episode that Assassin wasn’t really dead, although I guessed the reason wrong, but it could be interesting seeing how this servant with many parts functions within the rules. Kiritsugu’s deception with Saber is also a cool idea. There’s a lot to talk about with Kiritsugu and Irisviel, actually. For one, Maya was suddenly introduced, and now all of a sudden Kiritsugu seems like a scumbag. He had a kid with one girl, and now he’s talking about his kid with another girl that he’s also kissing? I’m sure this is going to be explained later, but for right now my initial good impression of Kiritsugu just evaporated. It also seems like Irisviel is going to be an incredibly pitiful character like Sakura. I’m really not a fan of that, tbh. And although I’m going to talk about it in more detail later, the music in the scene with her in the car was so over the top sad, for what’s not actually that sad of a moment. I hope that she doesn’t just end up being this overly tragic figure."")

[Zero and Fate route spoilers](/s ""Gilgamesh’s motivation seems different here, at least compared to what I remember from Stay Night. He’s just looking for treasures worth adding to his inventory, whereas in Stay Night he wanted to get with Saber. His talk about how he’s offended by being summoned into this time period rings hollow considering that he also stayed around for as long as he did."")

A couple more random thoughts: I really disliked Gilgamesh’s clanking armor, for some reason. It just bothers me I guess. And Lancer is kind of hot. I’m just looking forward to the fight next episode.

I also wanted to talk about the ED a little bit. It’s kind of weird to me that they did almost the exact same thing with the OP as with the ED visually. The focus is at least on the servants instead of the maters in this, but it’s just still shots of the servants during their lives! It’s sensible for the ED to not be as action packed as the OP should be, but I’m really underwhelmed. They’re pretty pictures, sure, but it’s just boring. The last shot that moves the camera forward across a battlefield is also animated weirdly. It’s super obvious that everything is drawn in 2d over a cg reference shot. Just leave it in cg, it would look better. The song itself is fine, not remarkable and not good, but it fits. 

The one thing that the ED is going to be good for is letting me guess the servants’ identities before they’re actually revealed. I’m curious how many of my predictions will be true. Probably not many considering how little info I have, but still. [Speculation, with HF spoilers](/s ""We know Saber, Rider, and Archer already. Assassin is the same as he was in HF, although this time there are many of them instead of just one. Which puts a weird spin on his relationship with Kirei. Anyway, for Caster, Bluebeard is a French folktale that I think is accurate to Caster’s presentation, and he’s shown being dragged off to be executed in the ED. But he also says Bluebeard as if it’s not his real name. So he’s probably Gilles de Rais, the serial killer behind Bluebeard’s legend. Lancer is shown outside a castle with a girl, so he’s European, but that doesn’t narrow down the possibilities much at all. I’ll have to learn more about him to figure it out. And lastly, Berserker has to be the guy standing in the lake, though we haven’t even met him in the story yet. But there’s not a whole lot of heroes associated with lakes that I can think of, and many of them are female at that (though I guess the armor could be hiding a female figure). I would guess Arthur or someone associated with him if Saber didn’t already claim that. He could be Chinese too, there are a few possibilities there."")

digitalhardcore1985,,"-8.38, -7.28","For starters NHS satisfaction has dropped [significantly this year](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-43213896). Satisfaction went [up significantly](http://www.bsa.natcen.ac.uk/media/38925/bsa32_health.pdf)(page 6) during the Labour years towards 70%, fell when the Tories came to power, crept up a bit and is now back at 57%, in short it's reversing. If you look on page 8 of that document you can see people voting along party lines in these surveys, they might also be motivated by not wanting to put the NHS down when under threat. Financially trusts are not coping, [with the percentage in deficit rising from 8% in 2009, peaking at 66% in 2016 and estimated to be 52% for 2018.](https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/projects/nhs-in-a-nutshell/trusts-deficit). That's not surprising when you consider:

&gt;Under the coalition government (2009–10 to 2014–15), health spending grew in real terms at an average annual rate of 1.1%. This was the lowest five-year growth rate since a consistent time series of health spending began in 1955–56 (the previous low being an average real growth rate of 1.5% between 1980–81 and 1985–86). 

[Source - Page 6](https://www.ifs.org.uk/uploads/publications/budgets/gb2017/gb2017ch5.pdf)

The Tories claim week after week at PMQ's that the NHS is seeing higher demand than ever before, which to my mind is even more reason for them to be embarrassed by that their spending regime.

As we can [see here](https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/media_large/public/2017-12/Figure%202%20Performance%20against%20the%20four-hour%20standard%2C%20all%20types%20of%20A%26E%2C%20by%20month%2C%20England.png?itok=bxWZFL2k) A&amp;E waiting time performance is down markedly and both 4 and 12 hour trolley waits have jumped [through the roof](https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/media_large/public/2017-12/Figure%206%20-%20Long%20trolley%20waits%20in%20A%26E%20departments.png?itok=0iVvEOaM). 

&gt; A&amp;E waiting times have continued to increase over recent years. More people are attending A&amp;E departments each year, and the complexity of the problems they have may be rising. At the same time, longstanding staffing issues and continued reductions in the number of hospital beds have made it more difficult for A&amp;E departments to admit patients… A&amp;E departments have constant interactions with other parts of the hospital, for example, to request diagnostic tests and to transfer patients to beds in other parts of the hospital. A&amp;E performance is therefore dependent on processes and capacity in other hospital departments, as well as other parts of the health and care system. High levels of hospital bed occupancy, delays in transferring patients out of hospital, and staff shortages throughout the urgent and emergency care system have all had an impact on A&amp;E waiting times.

[Source](https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/projects/urgent-emergency-care/urgent-and-emergency-care-mythbusters)

And just as we're squeezing the NHS as it faces higher demand, the same thing is happening in social care:

&gt; * local authority spending on social care for older people fell in real terms by 17 per cent; over the same period (2009 - 2015), the number of older people aged 85 and over rose by almost 9 per cent

&gt; * it has become much more difficult for people to get publicly funded social care; numbers have fallen by 25 per cent since 2009 (from 1.7 million to 1.3 million) and in 90 per cent of local authorities only those with ‘substantial’ or ‘critical’ needs will get publicly funded services.

They go on to say:

&gt; Adult social care has experienced an unprecedented five consecutive years of budget cuts. The Local Government Association estimates that social care faces a funding gap of £4.3 billion by 2020. We endorse the conclusion of the National Audit Office that neither national nor local government know how long the NHS and care system can continue to absorb these pressures.

[Source](https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/projects/verdict/how-serious-are-pressures-social-care)

That's despite council's best efforts to protect social care up against a 19% cut in central government funding:

&gt; Also over the period 2009–10 to 2016–17, central government grants for local authorities  were cut significantly, and as a result their total spending on services fell by 19%. Local authorities protected the social care budget relative to those of other services, so spending on social care increased as a share of their service spending from 34% to 39%

[Source](https://www.ifs.org.uk/uploads/publications/bns/BN200.pdf)

Which is leaving people to fend for themselves, staff are leaving in their droves and the NHS / self-funders (who pay more for their care) are propping up the councils. [Source](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-39043387)

We're the 6th richest country in the world and yet this last year we've seen [100,000 people waiting in ambulances outside a hospital over winter](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/18/nhs-crisis-wait-30-minutes-ambulance-winter), even the Torygraph couldn't see the [mass cancellation of operations in January](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/01/02/nhs-hospitals-ordered-cancel-routine-operations-january/) through the rose-tinted glasses you've found for yourself. 

In short, health and social is not in good shape, that is by design and it will get worse.

There are countless stories, backed up the statistics around overturned judgements and [hidden targets](https://www.disabilityrightsuk.org/news/2017/may/dwp-has-80-targets-refusing-benefit-reconsiderations). For all the misery they've caused they [haven't even saved any money.](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/dwp-fit-to-work-assessments-cost-more-than-they-save-report-reveals-a6801636.html) What sort of people spend £100 [fighting the disabled](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/12/disability-benefit-appeals-department-for-work-and-pensions-figures)? The sort of people who've imposed [more than 1m benefit sanctions](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/18/disabled-people-million-benefit-sanctions-since-2010) on people with disabilities since 2010, effecting 40,000 disabled [people since 2012](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/18/disabled-people-million-benefit-sanctions-since-2010). So it's really no wonder [attempted suicides amongst the disabled](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/disability-benefit-claimants-attempted-suicides-fit-to-work-assessment-i-daniel-blake-job-centre-dwp-a8119286.html) have risen 22% in 7 years.

No matter though so long as it [satisfies the press](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1324035/75-incapacity-claimants-fit-work-Benefits-test-weeds-workshy.html).

Which leads us on to the 6 week wait for claimants moving onto universal credit, again why? Just to punish them? No wonder rough sleeping numbers have risen [seven years in a row](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/25/rough-sleeper-numbers-in-england-rise-for-seventh-year-running).

For many people things may not have changed all that much but [home ownership](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/home-ownership-rate) is down, taking a nose dive for [under 45s](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/personal-banking/mortgages/under-45-chances-are-you-wont-own-a-home/) and although [wage growth has stayed]( https://tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/wage-growth) at around 2% (it was 4% before the crash) it’s estimated to perform terribly as [Brexit looms]( https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/dec/29/uk-to-sink-to-the-bottom-of-oecd-wage-growth-index-in-2018):

&gt; British workers are expected to see their earnings decrease by 0.7% in 2018 when taking account of inflation, which has surged in the past year as a result of the pound’s weakness since the EU referendum, pushing up the cost of importing food and fuel. 
&gt; Only two other OECD nations – Spain and Italy – are expected to record negative wage growth, although both still outperform the UK.

Which leads us onto Brexit. Corbyn may not be a remainer but he at least has a little sense on the issue. We’ve watched the Tories mishandle the negotiations every step of the way, delaying and arguing amongst themselves. What is clear is that there is an element of the party that wants to take us off a cliff edge, [attack workers rights]( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-debate-latest-ken-clarke-workers-rights-tories-not-fond-comments-labour-a8057451.html) and turn us into a tax haven and sign what will inevitably be an incredibly one-sided US trade deal that will only mean lowering our [food](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/06/trump-ross-says-uk-us-trade-deal-eu-brexit-chlorinated-chicken) and [farming]( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/14/us-trade-deal-government-farming-practices-livestock-antibiotics) standards and opening up our public services to greater competition. Believe you me, there are those across the pond who look upon our NHS with envious eyes and there are Tories who’ve been waiting for a once in a lifetime chance like Brexit. 
You claim you’d never vote Corbyn because you think people would be worse off under his stewardship but a Tory Brexit is the greatest threat this country has faced since the Second World War. You should vote for him just for a customs union and a sensible approach to the economy after Brexit if kicking the disabled and rising homelessness doesn’t do it for you.

The German Reich was ahead of both Britain and France in terms of economic output and championed the second industrial revolution more than any other European power.

Britain and France were afraid of losing their monopoly on trade in goods and did not want anyone else to play in their playground. They barely tolerated each other. And the profitability of the Suez Canal needed to be protected at all costs (so much so that they committed a massive diplomatic faux pas 40 years later in invading Egypt when it tried to nationalise the Suez canal).

flinnbicken,,,"Things are measurably better than the 90's or even the 80's. Of course, I'm assuming you live in either the EU or the Anglophone world. In other places your mileage may vary.

""The People"" were never in charge. Democracy was just used to pacify them. That said, democracy certainly gave the people more power but it was designed so that the elites would never lose their stranglehold. And they very seldom have. It did really well at preventing a repeat of the French Revolution though. So mission accomplished.

Similarly, institutional job insecurity helped prevent rampant inflation. This kept the rich richer and the poor working. Another mission accomplished.

And yet poverty is lower than ever despite a wealth gap greater than ever. We're lucky our overlords didn't want to go Putin on us or anything. And I think that was the wise choice. That said, Trump may be trying anyways... I'm not done fighting. I'm not that committed, though, either.

Just to be clear, if we had enough financial security not to worry about losing our houses or ending up homeless then we would become cocky and demand more and more from our overlords. It's that intense inflation that they needed to eliminate (through union busting which I detest and globalism which I support). They were successful. Now we do what we're told so we can keep our house and in return we get crazy new tech like computers that fit in your pocket. That said, the rich are getting too cocky and didn't heed income inequality enough. That's why change has happened; Trump and his isolationism and Brexit and so on.

I'm still fighting but I don't waste too much time on it. Should I ever get lucky and find myself among the elite then I would love to solve the inflation problem without forcing the working class into a state of constant anxiety.

MdxBhmt,,,"&gt; É mesmo muito interessante cara! Sobre o tema tem um livro ótimo, de leitura super acessível chamado ""O Nascimento da Ciência Moderna na Europa"", de Paolo Rossi. Se conseguir encontrá-lo vale muito a pena ler, é um livro fundamental na área. Se quiser, depois me mandar um PM, tenho um pedaço dele em pdf aqui.

Dou um jeito aqui, livro não é problema. Valeu a  dica.

&gt; E sim, o princípio da autoridade era muito utilizado para legitimar o conhecimento entre os próprios acadêmicos. Dizer que suas descobertas ou práticas eram baseadas em Aristóteles ou Galeno era o pré-requisito para que seus colegas não questionassem sua competência. 

Não acharia estranho que isso tem raizes no catoliscismo. Com a autoridade da biblica,  argumentos serem verso contra verso, pra depois passar a autoridade pessoal, com teses desenvolvidas por teologos, etc.

&gt;Mas você está certo, para a maior parte da população não importava muito no que seu conhecimento se baseava ou se você era um cientista respeitado ou o que. O que importava era se você era capaz de oferecer solução para os problemas da vida prática, qual sua reputação dentro daquela comunidade, esse tipo de coisa. O resultado disso era, inclusive, que muitas vezes a sabedoria popular tradicional ou obtida no exercício da profissão era mais valorizada entre a população do que o saber dos saídos diretamente das universidades, vistos como tão distantes das vidas cotidianas.

Pois então, muita das descobertas cientificas da época é gente resolvendo o 'problema'  matemático do outro, por carta ou afim. Até onde eu entendo, só  uma parte ínfima dos cientistas na historia que conseguem ter tanto o impacto na vida dos conterrâneos e marcar a posteridade com teses históricas.

O conhecimento prático tem sempre um valor imediato, o teórico muito dificilmente. É um bias engraçado de observar, quando a gente pensa no passado. A mesma coisa pode continuar acontecendo: as bases pras grandes teorias que vão influenciar nosso século talvez já foram firmadas, mas sem saber o que esse século nos reserva não podemos começar a procurar. Já o conhecimento prático de hoje, de nossos produtos, por mais complexos e aparentemente incontornáveis, podem se perder para sempre em mera década.

&gt; as a atitude do público em geral continua a mesma, o importante não é ser autoridade, é ter as soluções para as situações que se apresentam. 

É um novo senso de autoridade.

Fiveos2,mon,Monarchist,"I watched some of this debate, and I found it rather frustrating. I was unable to watch it all.

 I don't think the jews there were very good at arguing. They started out mentioning that angela merkel is not a jew...mark replied by pointing out that the heads of state often do not have all the power, but can be controlled or greatly influenced by the 'deep state'.

That was a fair point, and the jews should have responded by saying that it could not be confirmed that the 'deep state' is particularly Jewish...or tied to Jewishness in any way.

Instead they did not even say that, they just become offended at the idea that they do not know about the deep state, as if they forgot how the subject came up in the first place.

I couldn't watch anymore after that. I knew mark was going to smash these guys simply because he is more clear.

But yes...the history of jewish/gentile relations has been very two sided and you cannot place all of the blame on the jews...but neither can you on the gentiles. There isn't a simple way to observe it which makes it very difficult to even discuss around people of normal intelligence.

obviously, for example, the fact that William the conquerer decided to use the jewish ability to practice usury to tax the jews separately is part of the reason the jews later became expelled from England by Edward I. That was William's decision...he could have simply forced the jews to not practice usury as well and perhaps if he did there would not be the conflict which occurred later. naturally he did not, because it was a nice way to gain some extra money without being directly blamed for it...jews could be the convenient fall guys.

And that sort of thing did become a pattern throughout Europe. And jewish resentment over it is reasonable.

But regardless of 'blame',  it does support the greater and more general observation: ethnic diversity causes conflict and problems. In that grander perspective perhaps it WOULD be better for jews and gentiles to live separately. That is a plausible conclusion.

I'll post some links for you and I truly hope you have an honest look at the issues and maybe even do what you can to help some of these people.

[Why Men Oppress Women — 
The psychology of male domination](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/out-the-darkness/201208/why-men-oppress-women) posted to Psychology Today. It starts right out of the gate with:

&gt; Even if they belonged to higher social classes, most women throughout history have been enslaved by men. Until recent times, women throughout Europe, the Middle East and Asia were unable to have any influence over the political, religious or cultural lives of their societies. They couldn’t own property or inherit land and wealth, and were frequently treated as mere property themselves.

&gt; What was it like to be a woman in Tudor-Stuart England, from the time of Henry VIII through the Restoration, roughly 1525 to 1675—
&gt; when England was ruled for half a century by queens but women had almost no legal power;
&gt; when marriage, women's main vocation, cost them their personal property rights;
&gt; when the ideal woman was rarely seen and never heard in public;
&gt; when the clothes a woman wore were legally dictated by her social class;
&gt; when almost all schoolteachers were men;
&gt; when medicine was prepared and water purified at home;
&gt; when corsets were constructed of wood and cosmetics made of bacon and eggs;
&gt; when only half of all babies survived to adulthood?

BormaGatto,,,"Nenhuma ofensa, cara. Seu tom é genuíno, isso gera diálogo, é massa. Se fosse qualquer outro tom, eu nem me daria ao trabalho, mas você parece aberto a conversar, vale sempre a pena. Vamos lá:

&gt; ele sempre deixou claro que não queria influência [...] e que não queria criar um movimento político seja de qualquer viés.

Cara, se ele não quisesse ter influência sobre os outros, não teria [organizado cultos em que ele era o cabeça](https://www.diariodocentrodomundo.com.br/olavo-de-carvalho-montou-uma-seita-com-mentiras-orgias-e-politica-o-relato-de-um-ex-aluno-do-guru-da-extrema-direita/), não teria abusado dos membros do culto, [da mulher à época e das filhas daquela união para manter seu poder](https://veja.abril.com.br/brasil/filha-publica-carta-com-acusacoes-contra-olavo-de-carvalho/), não se proporia a [se associar com sujeitos como o Bolsonaro](http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2017/10/1925778-ideologo-de-bolsonaro-olavo-de-carvalho-critica-nova-direita.shtml) e não participaria de materiais produzidos com cunho político explícito. Nesse último caso, participar de materiais com fins políticos é exatamente alimentar tais movimentos e discursos. A coisa não se restringe a ocupar cargos somente.

&gt; Mas é inegável que ele tem uma bibliografia gigantesca.

Isso é fato indiscutível. O que se pode contestar é a qualidade dessa bibliografia gigantesca. Paulo Coelho tem uma bibliografia enorme com quase nenhuma qualidade literária. Autores desses livros de romance baboseira têm bibliografias gigantescas, quase impossíveis de listar. Um exemplo mais extremo é o de Heidegger, que tem uma bibliografia grande com influência considerável na filosofia ocidental - e usa parte dela para fazer apologia do fascismo. Claro, Olavão não chega a esse extremo (tão explicitamente), mas não é porque ele escreveu muito (ou publicou, já que editora não julga qualidade, mas sim potencial de lucro) que isso significa que deva ser levado a sério. Ele se recusa a engajar em qualquer debate sério, não dialoga em suas obras com nenhum especialista ou produção das áreas que pretende tratar - a não ser em seus próprios termos, claro. As críticas ele rebate com mais agressão.

&gt; a maioria das objetificações que o Olavo tem, são parecidissímas com o seu comentário: raramente rebatem o que ele disse ou escreveu. Isto não é exclusivo de seu caso. Tem acontecido sempre.

Isso deveria ser um sinal, não? Até porque ele próprio faz uso dessa estratégia, e isso inviabiliza qualquer diálogo. Mas tudo bem, vamos aos fatos: o Olavo, além de ser hipócrita, homofóbico e abusador (como exemplificado nos primeiros links que coloquei aqui), [é racista](https://bertonesousa.wordpress.com/2012/10/28/olavo-de-carvalho-um-filosofo-para-racistas-e-idiotas/), faz apologia à brutalidade da colonização portuguesa da América, [se engaja em anti-intelectualismo](https://medium.com/@fserb/coisas-que-o-olavo-de-carvalho-acredita-654e1617b6eb) e [espalha desinformação](https://epoca.globo.com/sociedade/noticia/2017/10/olavo-de-carvalho-o-guru-da-direita-que-rejeita-o-que-dizem-seus-fas.html), tudo isso sem a menor credencial ou credibilidade enquanto acadêmico de área nenhuma das que se mete a discutir. Ele pode se chamar de professor ou guru, mas não tem propriedade para lidar com nada além do que tem experiência em primeira mão - aristotelismo tacanho, é verdade (como bem colocou o u/MdxBhmt) - astrologia e administração de cultos de personalidade.

&gt; Existem diversas aulas dele no YouTube, e você pode sempre assisti-las, comparar com os dados ou bibliografias do que ele disse e tirar as próprias conclusões.

Já fiz isso. É daí que surge minha crítica ao elogio à colonização portuguesa e ao envolvimento dele com materiais que fazem uso de táticas retóricas enganadoras, fingindo ser educativos, mas na verdade são voltados para a inculcação política. E claro, acho essencial ir muito além das bibliografias que ele indica, porque ele não iria indicar bibliografias que tenham qualquer credibilidade, infelizmente.

Gileyboy,,,"Thanks for taking what I've written seriously and for taking the time with your reply.  You have missed out some of the points that I've written.

Some of what you say I'd agree with. I think what's happened with some of your points is plainly not right - specifically disability benefits (something that began under Labour).  I do have personal experience here.  I also stated that I thought Universal Credit was stupidly, inefficiently and cack-handedly introduced (although the general principal behind it is something that there is cross party support behind).  But my broad point was that for the vast majority of people life has improved, not by much, but improved.

Let's start with the NHS. Satisfaction has dipped, but that's been on the back of a flu epidemic (which by the way also hit our French cousins who also had mass cancelled operations and patients in ambulances https://www.thelocal.fr/20171214/paris-region-hit-by-flu-epidemic). It's still, as I stated in my post historically high, 10th out of all the years since 1983.  We spend more per person than many other countries in Western Europe - Austria as an example yet have broadly lower health outcomes, and in some areas (e.g. Cancer) considerably lower. We have a health care system that isn't fit for purpose yet no political will to fix it. We hold the NHS up as a religion, and yet other countries appear to do better.  This is across the political divide - the Tories won't sort it out (other than giving miserly increases) because it's electoral poison, and Labour simply want to 'weaponise' it. I'm in favour of the Lib Dem proposal of a Royal Commission.  

I'm going to ask you a question - what level of health spending would you be happy with?  Do you not feel it is sometimes a bottomless pit? If funding was to increase at the same increments it did between 2000-2010 by 2040 the NHS would take up 100% of state spending.

Regarding wage growth I'm not sure I'd agree with the TUC on this one.  With Employment levels now so high (which is a success you don't acknowledge in your reply), wages will rise (and inflation is likely to drop significantly as last years £ related inflation lessen).  The BOE has a figure of 3.1% for wage growth.

https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/14/uk-wages-soon-to-catch-up-with-inflation-bank-of-england-survey-finds

You wholly ignore my points about lower income workers doing better after tax and inflation is taken in to account.  The median household income, for example was actually up 2.3% after inflation was taken in to account. Inequality has lessened under this government (and it's predecessor).

Home ownership is a more complex issue.  This specifically affects under 45's, like me. There are three sides to this -
 a tightening of supply, partially because we have the wrong kind of ageing housing stock (more people want to live alone), partially due to mortgages being tightened after the crash, partially due to a significant slow down of house building in the immediate aftermath of the crash and the lag to get rebuilding after that. There is a great article here about this: https://fullfact.org/economy/house-building-england/  The question is how do you get builders to build more houses.   This is something I don't see any party put forward good concrete plans for. Labour just say 'We will build more houses', https://labour.org.uk/manifesto/secure-homes-for-all/,  they don't say how they will encourage this. The Conservatives ditto. There are ways you can encourage house building growth - by statute but it's avoided by all the main parties.

I take your point about Brexit - mishandled massively so. Do I think May is a good PM, God No. I think she is awful. I think the current state of the Tory party is parlous. However, do I think Corbyn would do a better job - are you crazy, no way?  I look at his history, his pronouncements like 'Enact Article 50 today', the day after the referendum and I don't see a man who can either strategise or negotiate anything. But then he's never had to. He's never had responsibility in any role. Is he someone who can campaign - yes. Can he 'do', no.

HeyIJustLurkHere,,,"Power creep doesn't just mean hitting bigger damage numbers than any other pokemon before. Power creep means something new coming along and being better than all the old stuff so the only options are to play the new thing or lose. (A situation where your other option is to play the thing that gets a 2x bonus due to weakness and still have like a 50/50 game isn't much better). 

Having a card that draws everything you need, plus hits for 120/150 on a single attachment is definitely power creep. In expanded, it can hit for 210 for a single attachment before Kukui, but that's not power creep because Gardevoir's resistance lets it not get OHKOd by it? Show me all the other cards hitting for 210 for a single attachment plus giving you a free draw 2 (thanks Exeggcute) every turn. I know other things hit bigger numbers, but the combination of massive damage output and massive draw power leads to a boring meta.

Zoroark is 100% the main attacker in all the standard decks in question, too, I don't know what you're referring to. The Zoropod deck that won [London](http://thecharizardlounge.com/2017/11/19/2017-european-international-championship-recap-and-decklists/#tord-zoroark-golisopod) and [Collinsville](https://www.pokemon.com/us/play-pokemon/collinsville-regionals-2018/tcg-masters/) plays 4-4 Zoroark and only 3-2 Golisopod. Tord Reklev explained himself that it's a Zoroark deck with Golisopod support, not vice versa. Same with [Oceania](https://www.pokemon.com/us/play-pokemon/internationals/2018/oceania/tcg-masters/)'s Zoroark-Garde; Zoroark is the main attacker, and its ability the only reason playing a thin Garde is at all feasible. Same with [Malmo](https://www.pokemon.com/us/play-pokemon/malmo-regionals-2018/tcg-masters/)'s Zoroark-Weavile; some other top decklists went as low as a 2-1 Weavile line. Zoroark carries most of the weight as an attacker in all of those decks, as well as obviously getting you all of your draw. 

Before Zoroark, a Gardevoir and a Golisopod deck would have like 30 cards different. Deckbuilding would be interesting, and matchups would involve more than the same Brigette for Zoruas and trade 120 back and forth every time. Now it's just ""choose a thin evolution line, throw in a few of its type energies, and throw in all the cards that are in every Zoroark deck"", and you're fine, with a better deck than if you had committed to the other pokemon.

Commustar,africa,Swahili Coast | Sudanic States | Ethiopia,"&gt; They could never be fully connected to the Silk road like Europe and Asia was. I'm not saying that they would have no access to it, but that their access would be limited.

So, despite the name, the Silk Road had both an overland network, but there was also a maritime dimension. Ships and products traveled from Chinese ports, through Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean, and into ports in the Persian gulf, Red Sea, and East African coast. There is an entire school of history that explores the interactions along the Indian ocean edge, calling themselves and their area of study as the ""Indian Ocean World"". A good place to start would be Edward Alpers' book _The Indian Ocean in World History_. 

The take-home message I am trying to impart is, East Africa was deeply connected to the societies of India, the Middle East, and perhaps more distantly connected to China. Indeed, [here is a database](https://sites.google.com/site/historyofeastafrica/contents1) that collects Arab, Indian, Southeast Asian and Chinese sources from the middle ages that describe East Africa.

So, it is very much a mistake to think of ""Sub-Saharan Africa"" as being remote from the Silk Road or from direct contacts with the wider world. 

&gt;When I talk about a 'lack of development' I mean that ground-breaking and revolutionary inventions and ideas reach them and are adopted relatively late.....Which I think would result in new technology and ideas being adopted later or not at all.

So, I would point to the example of the spread of Bananas from melanesia to Madagascar by the 5th century BC. Then banana cultivation spread to the mainland of East Africa, and across the continent to Angola some time after the 11th century AD.

Additionally, the spread of Islam from North Africa to the West African sahel can be seen as an example of the ready adoption of outside ideas (and their reinterpretation in local contexts). Furthermore, Ghislane Lydon has written about the islamic scholars of Timbuktu, Gao and Wangara, and their eager acquisition of books coming from Tunis, Cairo and Damascus, in her book *The Trans-Saharan Book Trade*.

So, there was adoption and exchange of ideas. Also, there was internal innovation and changes in political organization, changes in the arts, development of glass blowing, bronze making, iron smelting that all differed substantially from the technical aspects of Eurasian methods.

On the other hand, there are instances where African societies were exposed to new technologies but opted not to adopt them. For instance, John Thornton points out in _Warfare in Atlantic Africa_ that the Songhai empire was aware of firearms in the 16th century, but was resistant to adopting them because their military was already established on a strong cavalry arm coming from their social elites. Of course, a Moroccan expedition in 1591 that was heavily armed with firearms was able to defeat the Songhai army at Tondibi and led to the dissolution of the Songhai state.

_On the other hand_, the Oyo empire in what is now southern Nigeria based their power on a powerful cavalry arm. They successfully invaded and conquered the kingdom of Dahomey in the early 1700s, despite Dahomey being well armed with firearms.

So, despite your presumption that new technologies would be adopted as soon as societies are exposed to them, that is not really borne out. The advantages of a technology will not always be obvious, or a technology might not be relevant to the lifestyle of a society. Also, adoption of new technologies does not necessarily guarantee that a society will be more prosperous or successful than a neighboring society that does not adopt (e.g. Dahomey with firearms).

For suprnova you'd just change the server to:

    zen.suprnova.cc

the port to:

    3618

and you'd change the user to &lt;username&gt;.&lt;worker&gt;

And the password to your worker password

but I wouldnt use suprnova, they have about 1/3rd the network:

NascentLeft,,,"Actually, your argument is not with Marxism at all, CMM.  It's with the way Marxism was implemented by Lenin, and/or it is with Lenin himself and those around him.  Ponder this: Marxist analysis has nothing to do with what happened in Russia: it's like blaming Jesus Christ for the Inquisition in Spain.

Realize that Marx was a critic of capitalism.  His works are critiques.  He wrote very little about socialism.  He didn't get into details about how it would work or what it would look like.  He wrote critiques of capitalism.

Regarding socialism, he said that the working class would cast off the chains of exploitation and workers would form productive associations and run them themselves.  Everything that happened afterward with communist parties and revolutions and the policies afterward were individuals' attempt to express in action what they thought would work to create a socialist society that Marx mentioned.  They didn't follow a Marxian formula because there was none.  So whatever they did, whatever mistakes they make, whatever crimes they committed were not the fault of Marx in any way.  It was their own.   So Marxist analysis has nothing to do with what happened in Stalin's Russia: it's like blaming Jesus Christ for the Inquisition in Spain.

And the theory of how to create a socialist society is still evolving by learning from past mistakes.  Capitalism wasn't a straight-line process of just building.  It had its ups and downs.  It endured mistakes and setbacks.  But supportive laws were developed and guidelines were created as capitalist economics improved.  The same will happen with socialism.

The early strategies utilized in Russia and China failed.  The working class never did own and run their factories and businesses.  The state did that with appointed managers and they controlled the disposition of the profits.  They had state capitalism.  So what went wrong?

One thing that went wrong was the failure to follow Marx's analysis that said the economy of a country is the foundation from which everything else springs: culture, politics, laws, education, etc.  And it all rises in support of the economic base.  But what did the Russian and Chinese Communist Parties do first?  They seized state power with the plan of using that power to create a socialist economy.  That is to say that the state is the foundation and the economy will spring from the state politics.  That's backward according to Marx.

Then those who opposed violent revolution called themselves ""socialists"" to distinguish themselves from communists who wanted revolution.  And what did the socialists do?  In many European countries they worked to get favorable politicians elected to office so they could create ""socialist-type programs"".   They did a good job but they too have had trouble creating a socialist economy, and today, the right in those countries is staging a come-back and pressing for austerity.

So Marxists from around the world have met to hash out what went wrong and how to move forward.  And they came up with a ""revolutionary"" plan.... -build a socialist economy FIRST and let the politics follow, springing from the needs of the socialist economy!!   Thank you Karl!!

So how does this new plan work?  It works by forming Worker-owned, Worker-controlled cooperatives, like Mondragon in Italy which is the most successful example, 60 years old, 80 THOUSAND workers, and the workers hire and fire the CEO and the Board of Directors.

There are over 1,000 such co-ops in the US today and now 6 states have passed legislation to provide a clear pathway for the formation of such co-ops.

A socialist economy is being built.

Hamakua,,,"&gt;No it isn't. The government straight up threatened the whole industry with ""If you don't censor yourself in a way we deem fitting, we'll tax and regulate your entire industry out of existence"". There's no free will whatsoever. 

That's the definition of self imposed, I didn't claim it was out of the good of their hearts.  I know the history, ironically you are cannibalizing your own argument further down.   Do you suggest the gun industry should be let-loose from the shackles of government and develop their own criteria for regulation?

As for Politicians being Politicians and using moral panic to further agendas - same could be said about firearms - but I'm not suggesting one should push with the wind or against it just because a politician might be a stopped clock.   They lie, they deal, they don't have your best interest at heart, I'm not arguing otherwise, I'm also not an an anarchist of any stripe and government is a necessity, even when it's faulty at times.

&gt;""Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others."" - W.S. Churchill

---

&gt;All well and good. Do you believe that government regulation is necessary for loot crates?

Yes, because steadily over the last decade or so large publishers have become increasingly more predatory in their game design.  It's very difficult to explain the entire evolution and system in anything short of a college paper - but the elements are there and this has long ""been known"" through tantential issues.   As a snapshot example - South Park have already made fun of the issue... [in 2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemium_Isn%27t_Free).

&gt;If so, why do you believe that it isn't required elsewhere?

I didn't claim firearms shouldn't be regulated,   you are putting words into my mouth.  I said I was pro-2nd amendment.   I do not think the spirit of the 2nd amendment needs the average citizenry to have access to fighter jets or armed tanks.   Nuclear or biological weapons.    

As for fully automatic personal arms - this is a grey area.  The spirit of the 2nd amendment is to prevent any governing body from becoming so powerful that even the citizenry cannot fight back or resist it.  It's not about hunting.  Where should we draw that line?   This is where give and take and compromise come into play.

I'd be for, example, re-opening the average citizen to own fully automatic firearms under the condition they submit for psychological review of them and 3 unrelated witnesses for [x] years.  (you need unrelated contacts for taking out a student loan as an example).  While also increasing the scrutiny for mental illness along with its enforcement.

I am for a specialized regulation of individuals enrolled in a K-12 system.   ""Can you be on school property?"" then your right to bear arms comes under special restrictions.  For example  If you are enrolled in a public or private K-12 system treat firearm ownership like a learner's permit.   Only allowed when accompanied by a licensed adult.   If you are home schooled and ""Wouldn't be allowed on a K-12"" campus - as most schools function these days, the restrictions would be lower -perhaps.

I'm against putting a ""Teenage"" age limit on gun ownership but understand why one might want to.  Emotional turmoil of youth.   once again - this goes to more psychological vetting in gun ownership and the enforcement of existing laws.

---
This is a small tangent, but related.

Know why Europe, Canada, and Australia doesn't need 2nd amendment rights?  Because the US are literally the world police.   Know why the US citizenry need second amendment rights?   The same reason.

The reason why you aren't serving a warrior class that serves a lord class right now is because of the Gun.   And I don't believe for one second that beyond 3 days of food (about how long a supermarket would last if the supply chain stopped) we have evolved beyond that concept.

---

However, even though I'm left of [center myself.](https://www.politicalcompass.org/chart?ec=-5.13&amp;soc=-4.05)  The ""far left"" is arguing for gun regulation in bad faith.  They do so not for more regulation because current regulation is ineffective (it's not being enforced) they are doing so to hopefully get a gun ban because they think it will solve the gun ""problem.""  I don't think it's a problem, I think it's a cost for a particular liberty,   a responsibility that we've been neglecting as a citizenry.

WikiTextBot,,,"**Cold War II**

Cold War II (also called the New Cold War, Second Cold War and Cold War 2.0) refers to a renewed state of political and military tension between opposing geopolitical power-blocs, with one bloc typically reported as being led by Russia and/or China, and the other led by the United States, European Union and NATO. This is akin to the original Cold War that saw a global confrontation between the Western Bloc led by the United States and the Eastern Bloc led by the Soviet Union, Russia's predecessor state. American political scientist Robert Legvold posits that the ""new Cold War began the moment we went over the cliff, and that happened with the Ukraine crisis."" Others, such as Andrew C. Kuchins in 2016, believe that the term is ""unsuited to the present conflict,"" though Kuchins argues it may be more dangerous. Philip N. Howard believes that the conflict is experienced through information warfare conducted primarily over and through broadcast media, social media, and information infrastructure.

cthulhushrugged,asia,Early and Middle Imperial China,"The Ming was something of a curiosity in terms of its tax provisions, compared to most of the other Chinese dynastic eras of rule. Though the regime certainly borrowed extensively from previous dynastic policies – financial policies such as having supervisors double as fiscal auditors, circulation of paper government notes to act as currency, the trade and taxation of tea for horses with the nomads of central Asia, and governmental monopoly on the production and sale of salt being the most obvious examples of policies taken up pretty much wholesale from the Yuan, Song, and Tang regimes that preceded the Ming.  At the same time, the early Ming state differed substantively from its antecedents – and thus set the tone for the whole dynasty – in terms of remarkably high concentration of power in the person of the emperor himself, and thus a relatively smaller number of regional and local administrators, as well as a greater reliance on agrarian sources of revenue than its predecessosr, especially after the death of the second emperor and the heavy restriction of maritime trade.

Part of the reason for these differences stems from the fact that under the Ming regime, policy was focused on correcting the perceived imbalance in development between different regions of the realm. The coastal regions – much like China today – profited immensely from foreign trade and craft work, while the interior toiled under much the same agrarianism that had been the lot of a farmer since time immemorial. From Ray Huang: 

&gt; As the Ming administrators saw it, to promote those advanced sectors of the economy would only widen the economic imbalance, which in turn would threaten the empire's political unity. It was far more desirable to keep all the provinces on the same footing, albeit at the level of the more backward sectors of the economy. The Ming fiscal policies were largely determined by this attitude. Such an approach seems absurd to the modern historian, in that it sacrificed China's long-term economic growth for the sake of a short-term political aim. Ming administrators, however, did not have the foresight to visualize the contributions that industry and commerce could ultimately render to a modern state. 

China was vastly larger than any Western European state, or those feudal territories of pre-Tokugawa Japan for that matter. What this meant was that promoting industy and commerce would have far more visible and immediate positive effects on those smaller territories, whereas across the vastness of the Ming, such benefits were much less clear. Another explanation was that – again, very much unlike Japan or Europe – within the borders of the Ming, there was virtually no regional competition, and thus no real impetus to revise or adapt policies that were deemed “good enough.”  In other words, Ming administrators felt that they “could afford the price of backwardness” to achieve their goal of uniform stability over the whole empire.

The Ming tax system was based on household registration, the so-called Yellow Book system (*huangce*) with a census to be taken every 10 years beginning in 1381 under the personal direction of the founding Hongwu Emperor, and with the last Ming census completed in 1642, just two years before the dynasty’s collapse. The population as a whole was classified into 4 broad categories: 1) general population, 2) hereditary military families, 3) artisans, and 4) households involved in the state production of salt.

Travel and trade, though not outright forbidden, were heavily discouraged. This is probably best summed up by Hongwu’s favorite moral dicta from the *Dao Dejing*:

&gt; Let the state be small and the people few;  
So that the people... fearing death, will be reluctant to move great distances  
And, even if they have boats and carts, will not use them.  
So that the people... will find their food sweet and their clothes beautiful,  
Will be content with where they live and happy in their customs.  
Though adjoining states be within sight of one another and cocks crowing and dogs barking in one be heard in the next,  
Yet the people of one state will grow old and die without having had any dealings with those of another.

In order to travel from state to state one had to have an official passport and be registered with the government. Those found in contravention of these demands were harshly punished. Once again, this is largely because extensive trade tended to promote regional inequality and disuniformity, one of if not *the* primary concern of the Ming court.

Part of the tax collected was in the form of compelled, unpaid labor, or the levy system. In every villages, households were organized into the *lijia* system. Every 110 households formed a *li*, with each *li* being further subdivided into 10 *jia* of 10 households each. The remaining 10 households – those deemed to be the largest and wealthiest by census-takers – took turns each year to act as the head of their *li*. Each year within a *li*, one of the 10 *jia* would be tapped as levy labor:

&gt; Under the direction of the li chief of the year, it performed the local tax collection and delivery, and met all material and labor requisitions on behalf of the entire li. The other units paid their regular taxes, but were not liable to service obligations that year. Thus in a decennial period all households took a one-year turn at discharging their service obligations. After the ten-year cycle a new census was taken and all li-chia were re- organized in accordance with the changes that had occurred during the decade. With certain variations, the wards and precincts in the cities were organized along similar lines. 

Services rendered by the *jia* called up for their year-long spate of duties could expect to perform tasks for the government such as providing office attendants for the administration, from the county all the way up to the imperial government... in role as varied as doormen, guards, messengers, litter-bearer, cooks, buglers, boatmen, patrolmen, jailers, stable grooms, receiving men in warehouses, operators of canal watergates, and clerical assistants. As mentioned, this wasn’t necessarily confined to one’s home region, but instead wherever the government deemed a vacancy needed to be filled.

In terms of materials that were requisitioned from the lijia system, they too fell completely on the “designated *jia*, and could be quite extensive. They were to supply the local government with things like stationary, oil, charcoal, and candles, as well as military equipment like swords, bows, arrows, and uniforms. And from regions of interesting or useful botanical growth, a *jia* could expect to have herbs and medicinal plants as a part of the quotas. These quotas were based on the basic fiscal unit of the *ting*, meaning able-bodied male – and what one of those “ought” to be expected to be able to provide. Unlike, say, a land tax though, there were elements of progressive taxation: households were not all expected to be able to contribute the same, but were instead classified into upper, middle, and lower categories, with obligations distributed accordingly.  This would work well at the beginning of the dynasty, but as time went on and more and more families were able to commute their *jia* obligations through payments of silver, problems gradually cropped up at a systemic level.

Commanders!What better way to complement the celebrations of the World Wildlife Day than with an offer of some of the most merciless predators of Armored Warfare battlefields – the Shark vehicles!But beware – these terrors from the deep are anything but endangered. Instead, they are eager to turn the tables and hunt you down to extinction. Either you’re a predator, or a prey – such is the merciless law of the wild!The Shark edition vehicles feature level 5 crews and unique camouflage. They include:ERC 90 Shark Tier 5 Premium Tank DestroyerFV721 Fox Shark Tier 6 Premium Armored Fighting VehicleStingray 2 Shark Tier 7 Premium Light TankT-80U Shark Tier 7 Premium Main Battle TankThe Shark vehicles are permanently available in the Web Shop both for both standard currency and for Gold.From March 2 to March 16, 2018, the abovementioned vehicles are also available in the following special bundles: ERC 90 Shark The ERC 90 (also known as “Sagaie”) is a French heavily armed reconnaissance vehicle and tank destroyer, named after a type of African spear. It was developed by Panhard from 1975 specifically for export, although France did purchase 192 in the 1980s. You can learn more about its history in our dedicated article!In Armored Warfare, the ERC 90 is a Tier 5 Premium Tank Destroyer. It’s one of the most popular vehicles amongst Tier 5 tournament players – and for a good reason! It combines a powerful 90mm cannon with excellent mobility, making it a truly deadly opponent. It’s fast and agile and when operated by an experienced player, the enemies don’t have a clue what hit them.Aside from the permanent offer (including for Gold), it is available in the following bundle:Improved Bundle with 20% discount, containing:ERC 90 Shark Tier 5 Premium Tank Destroyer5 Gold Loot Crates2 Platinum Loot Crates7 days of Premium Time500 Gold  FV721 Fox Shark The Fox CVR(W) was born in the early 1960s as a complementary vehicle to the CVR(T) vehicle series (that included the Scorpion and the Scimitar tracked reconnaissance vehicles) and was the result of a program to replace the aging Alvis Saladin. Produced from 1972-1973 to around 1985, roughly 325 vehicles were made, of which Britain kept 200 and exported the rest. It was never a very successful export vehicle – more than 100 went to Nigeria and Malawi (an unknown number remains in service to this day) and the British Foxes were phased out of service by 1994. The phased out Fox turrets along with phased out Scorpion hulls were actually used to produce a rather peculiar hybrid vehicle, the Sabre.In Armored Warfare, the FV721 Fox Shark is a Tier 6 Premium Armored Fighting Vehicle. The FV721 Fox is one of the fastest and nimblest vehicles of Armored Warfare. It can dance around its opponents, unloading round after round of 30mm ammunition into their soft, rear areas, or destroy them from distance using guided missiles. It’s also one of the best spotters in the game, making it extremely valuable to any team it finds itself in.Aside from the permanent offer (including for Gold), it is available in the following bundles:Improved Bundle with 21% discount, containing:FV721 Fox Shark Tier 6 Premium Armored Fighting Vehicle5 Gold Loot Crates10 Gold Battlefield Glory 12-hour Boost Tokens15 Gold Crew Insignia tokens15 Gold Commander Insignia tokens15 Gold Reputation Insignia tokens15 Gold Credits Insignia tokens15 Gold Global Reputation Insignia tokens1.100 GoldPrime Bundle with 32% discount, containing:FV721 Fox Shark Tier 6 Premium Armored Fighting Vehicle15 Platinum Loot Crates15 Platinum Battlefield Glory 12-hour Boost Tokens50 Gold Crew Insignia tokens50 Gold Commander Insignia tokens50 Gold Reputation Insignia tokens50 Gold Credits Insignia tokens50 Gold Global Reputation Insignia tokens2.200 Gold  Stingray 2 Shark The Stingray 2 Light Tank was developed by Cadillac Gage as an upgraded variant of the original Stingray. The philosophy behind both Stingrays was to install powerful, MBT-class 105 mm rifled cannon on a light, mobile and – most importantly – affordable chassis. Despite its qualities, the vehicle was never a commercial success because the market became flooded with Cold War surplus.In Armored Warfare, the Stingray 2 Shark is a Premium version of the Tier 7 Light Tank, featuring unique camouflage and Level 5 crews.

Mefic_vest,,,"My late wife did have AWALT symptoms, but managed to suppress most of them quite admirably. In particular, she was completely faithful and loyal, took responsibility for her own decisions and while I could see that she became emotional at times, she always did her best to remain rational and objective even through the most personal of situations. Not overly submissive except in bed, but often willing to let me take the lead in life because she liked it. She appreciated me being patriarchal; she said it made her feel safe and protected.

Her work paid more, but the workload and hours were less than mine, so she took on quite a few of the traditional roles. Most meals were made by her, she took ownership of the laundry, and absolutely rocked the garden. I handled the finances and investments, but she assembled (most of) the budget. She was frugal, too. Would gladly pay top dollar for something that would last a century than buy a Chinese-made el-cheapo that would need replacing every year or two. I still have (and treasure) the cast-iron pans that I inherited from her. They were old when she got them from her grandmother, and it’s been over a quarter century since then.

I think that if she had not died before her time, we would have probably been very happy together well into old age.

The pain of loss never does go away, it just becomes more bearable with time. And I now understand why some people just never remarry (or even get into another relationship) once their SO passes away -- the hole that remains in their soul is enough of a testament to how special that person was; there is no filling that gap.

DSM-6,,,"&gt; Is it? Why?

My entire post explains why concentrated wealth is a problem.

&gt; This isn't a problem with wealth, this is a problem with corrupt people. do something about that problem.

Let's get people to be immune to ""having someone pay them to do something they would rather not?"" Are you suggesting that we get rid of the labor system as it is? It's not just an issue with politicians. It's an issue that is endemic to our society. It's the secretary who says nothing when her boss sexually harasses her, cause she might lose her job/income. It's the shady businessman, who says ""If I didn't do this, someone else would."" It's forced marriages in the third world, where father's sell their daughter for a bride price. It's prostitution, drug mules, gang members, everything. Most of those people, when they sit down and are honest with themselves, they'd rather not be doing what it is that they're doing, but they do it anyway. **For the money**. It's not just a case of a couple of ""morally corrupt"" politicians. 

It would be great to live in a world, where everyone is morally just and can't be influenced by money. And I think we should strive for that. But, it's silly to assume that we're going to get there anytime soon. Hell, we may never get there. So, while we're striving to make the world a better place and raising our children to be moral, let's do something that works in current society. Let's blunt the ability for people to use wealth as a tool of oppressive power.

&gt;  If you treat all rich people as badguys

I don't. I'm just saying that a society with high wealth inequality has a lopsided power distribution. And I'm not comfortable with a lopsided power distribution. You can say the same thing about old European monarchs. Americans didn't revolt because George III happened to be a bad monarch (even though he was). They revolted because colonialism meant that Americans had relatively little power over their own laws, land and liberties. The problem was the lopsided power distribution.  


&gt; telling people they have to give up their wealth

No one has to give up their wealth. It's a progressive tax. It's not communism. Think of making money as video game. If you're good at it, you level up. If you level up, you get to face harder enemies and obstacles. That's fair, right? If our wealth tax starts at $10 million, no one will ever touch your $10 million. It's just that if you want to level up (be wealthier than $10 mil), you're going to have to face the extra obstacle of a wealth tax. Making first $10 mil was easy. You got there wealth tax free. The next $10 mil should be a little harder. 


I'm just saying that wealth should be harder. It's shouldn't be: I get to start my business with a ""small million dollar loan"" and all of my dad's contacts. Or: I didn't have the grades to get into Harvard, but daddy gave them donation, so I got in anyway. I'm just saying that we shouldn't live in a society where it's easier for the rich to make money than it is for the poor.


&gt; Maybe those guys should talk about X and come to an agreement on it rather than wasting their wealth working at cross purposes.

I do love your optimism. Tell ya what. You get the pro- and anti-abortionist in room together, or maybe Israel and Palestine, how about the Westboro Baptist Church and some gay activists? Anyway, once they've come to an agreement and promise to stop funding ""cross purposes"", give me a call and I'll withdraw all my points.

Masteralexo,,,"If you're in for a ramble, I have quite a long one.

I think the first step to my thinking is that the culture developed within the US is inherently different from anything preceding it in history. 

There are countless instances of nations trading, exchanging goods, cooking recipes, etc. but the physical movement of people was much scarcer. Meaning, the ethnicity of most people (and thus cultural aspects like ideology, religion, etc.) was more homogeneous. This is not to say there were not civil conflicts because there were numerous, but the conflicts outside of nations was arguably much more abundant. The point of my rambling is that people from one place tended more so to stay in that place, and the people around them tended to be very similar. 

In the US, people come from various ethnic groups / countries, where their children become second, third, fourth generation Americans. Now what is an American and what are the children that were born here? What do they absorb as their primary culture? It becomes a mix of their household's culture and the rest of their environment outside their household. Their sense of self is definitely molded by both of these contributors. 

Thus, what we have is a hodgepodge of ideals and conflicting thoughts the world has never seen up until modern times. In colonial times, the dominant mix of cultures tended to be western European, and change is harsh. After harsh struggle, Africans, Irish, Polish, Asians, etc. were further blended into the mix as far as the collective effect their culture / ideology has on the country as well as overall acceptance of that ethnicity as ""American."" 

The US we live in now is without a doubt the most accepting and equal towards various backgrounds, sexes, identities it has ever been. Now where does the racial conflict we see come from? The conflict was always there, and has changed in intensity, but is also being talked about / communicated much more.

Let's start by looking at what's going on right now. Social change is happening at an extremely rapid rate. Sexual assaults are being called out among the powerful. Drug laws are slowly shifting towards rehabilitative / accepting. Etcetera, etcetera. What the PROFOUND difference is, is that individuals are all more readily aware of these social conflicts / changes. Social media has truly changed the pace at which information is passed, and the way it is absorbed, for better or worse. Ignoring merits of any cause, the louder you are, the more you are heard. This holds true for social media, and media in general. 

Now let's hone back in on the underlying issue of this thread: cultural appropriation and the racial tension surrounding it. We are historically not that far away from times of slavery, and times of mass immigration via Ellis Island.
The US compared to then has laws that for the most part reflect equality, and people that do not discriminate explicitly. History is a knot of injustices on various groups of people, and the US has shown that injustices (at least within the US) can be overcome through work and a shift in identity. Analyzing how past injustices affected various ethnic groups can be done, but as an ethnic group within the US, what matters in order to change is to work towards that change ($/capita, positions of power), and identify to a greater extent as American. (There are those that believe general equality of opportunity does not exist here, but I wholeheartedly disagree.) Focusing on the movements that push for racial equality, I believe the effects have for the most part been excellent. However, these movements splinter into sub-movements and pockets of people with more radical ideals (as happens anywhere, really). These people can be equally vocal through social media, and these ideas spread to the ears of the majority, who may begin to either accept it to some lesser extent, or begin viewing entire legitimate movements as radical. This eventually lead to today's level of racial tip-toeing, especially towards minority groups. 
I believe this over-delicacy is harmful, because it is undoing the growing racial blending in America and forcing racial difference like color and ethnicity to stay in the limelight. 

Now (finally), back to the cultural appropriation. Although this is analogous since I haven't looked for any statistic, the majority of the people I see / hear that are offended by cultural appropriations are Americans are at least several generations raised in America (regardless of race). At the same time, individuals more closely attached to their ethnicity (first gen. for instance) are not bothered by a pierogi here, a sombrero there, or whether or not this famous person this hairstyle or outfit in a music video. Presenting facets of a culture, even oversimplified facets, are beneficial to exposing and integrating those elements into the social mesh. 

In summary what I believe to be the source of this backlash at subjectively offensive instances of cultural appropriation is rampant polarization in social media, and the way people part of (no longer so minor) minority groups and majority groups are being conditioned to react due to a whole mess of reasons which I tried to unravel. The only thing I can say on what to do with all of this is: be proud to Argentinian. Be proud to be Sudanese. Be proud to German. Be proud to be whatever ethnic group you are part of. Show this pride and incorporate it into the US in through education, through kindness, not through hatred and polarization. Teach others about your culture and be proud to share with the others what your culture has to offer.

tldr: It's complicated and positivity towards cultural appropriation and cultural exchange is ultimately healthy for social growth.

People who jump on the viral media bandwagon are as much to blame as people who are touting one way or the other in the debate on who did what more wrong.

Truth is, no one will know until there is a review done. Even if there is a review done, there's always one side that is never happy with the outcome of the review and comes up with some social justice term to blame the other side. (Race/Ethnicity is often the most frequent).

And again, I bring up the majority of East Asia then because, keep in mind I’m not a lawyer versed in all Asian law, I’m pretty sure my mother, aunts, and cousins being able to own their own businesses in China, Taiwan, Korea, and Japan are indicative of legal equality. Seriously, none of my male relatives’ names are attached in terms of ownership. 

As for open gayness, I’m not sure about the legality, but there is very little persecution or harassment in the large cities of East Asia. I’m not sure how gay you’re talking (I’m really not trying to be offensive, but like what do you mean? Being gay doesn’t look or sound like one thing?). I’m a New Yorker and I’ve seen gay couples get harassed by drunk douchebags in all the lower Manhattan neighborhoods except for Chelsea. There’s assholes everywhere, regardless of legality.

When passionate Leavers talk about the sovereignty issue (in my experience), they speak as though the EU were directly infringing on them as individuals, cutting out the middle man of the UK government and legislature entirely. As a Remainer I accept that being part of the EU infringes on our national sovereignty, but I don't see how individual sovereignty or liberty is part of the argument.

Do Leavers believe that, once we are out of the EU, we as individuals will feel a greater sense of ownership and influence on lawmaking and government policy in this country?

### Submission Statement

This documentation gives a oversight about the strategic resource natural gas (NG) in Europe and the positions of the US, East Europe and West Europe by the public channel Deutsche Welle, financed by the German government. The facts DW is presenting should be questioned, but not the political stance of the parties in this dispute. The video is interesting because it makes interviews with all sides in this matter or let them speak through archived material, which gives us a good insight into the various positions.

For Germany North Stream 2 is a minor investment of capital, but with a high strategic importance. NG is used in industry and households. Higher prices are a seen as a greater problem for economic reasons and any other issue is considered as minor. This is often forgotten. Since liquefied NG (LNG) is much more expensive because of the energy losses, the outlook to buy LNG from the US is not met with enthusiasm. And since Trump is implementing his vision of politics, I doubt anyone will change this stance. The Germany industry is already calling for an end of the sanctions and German governments will have problem to deny this demand. The loyalty of Germany towards the US shrunk to a bare minimum since Trump

East Europe doesn't want to pay the political price  or is opposed to North Stream2  for various reasons. I don't know the exact position of France on this matter, but since Germany is one of the most important partners, an open split can't be imagined. France and Germany will work together in the future because they have no choice, when they economies are that much intertwined. Since East Europe's future is depending on the economic development of the EU, I doubt Germany will not have enough power to make a push for German interest.

Torgva22,,ბოროტი ნაციონალისტი,"Very relevant. It is relevant to the youth because a big part of the youth knows about ""Georgian culture"" only in the context of their environment of commie blocks, Shardeni cafes and night clubs. We live in a small country already, yet a big part of the youth encloses itself in their concrete jungles, confused in their own morality and principles because of the minimal emotional investment of their fathers. One side swallows the Western liberal dogma, another side swallows the radical nationalist dogma (though I prefer this over the abhorrent moral relativism of the left) and the majority just goes with whatever opinion gives you a better standing in society at this point in time. We have a good word for this, მედროვეობა. I had the ""privilege"" (sadly a privilege in modern urban Georgia) of visiting my village a few times and participating in Lomisoba in the case of my region. The feeling of a close bond with your compatriots is so strong in that moment, along with the views around you, that it is hard to consider your nation inferior and embarrassing after that.

Sadly, the part of the youth that will be the most influential is the purest breed of modern liberals (not talking about the respectable classical liberalism), the breed of the 76 genders and gender identity, multicultural and LGBT praise. The Baia Pataraia stuff in short. If anyone thinks what I am talking about has no relation to cultural cringe, think more carefully. The UK and USA are destroying themselves from within even despite their economic prosperity. The Labour party of the UK has just invited an anti-white racist radical feminist. Meanwhile Sweden has already formed large ghettos in one of their cities and smaller ones in other cities. Germany has 4 million Turks among which many are radical nationalists to Turkey,  and Erdogan has exploiting that already and will most likely keep trying. The proportion of ethnic Frenchmen in French is drastically decreasing because of immigration and high non-French birth rates. Brussels is a melting pot almost as bad as New York. The increase in ethnic, demographic issues and the loss of strong ethnic identity among Westerners but Europeans in particular has been happening together with the increase of intensity of feminist and minority movements. Absolute Individualism has proven to be detrimental to mental health (high levels of depression), and this is being worsened in the West by the blurring of the social, ethic boundaries. Do we want to go that way? Or should we preserve the homogeneity of our nation as much as possible? Should we further urbanise or should we focus on living in smaller settlements for our own well-being. 

Tldr: The doubtless emulation of the West IS a form of cultural cringe. It is the acknowledgment of your own cultural and social values being inferior. It is the acknowledgement that you think that your nation cannot develop in any way, cultural or economic, without foreign assistance. It is the purposeful subversion of the traditional way of life and mentality of your own people.

Fabius_Cunctator,,,"&gt;Jährlich töten Jäger in der EU 52 Millionen Vögel - auch solche, die eigentlich geschützt sind. Das Problem: die unterschiedlichen Regeln in den Mitgliedstaaten.

-

&gt; Jährlich töten Jäger in der Europäischen Union mehr als 52 Millionen Vögel. Bei einem Großteil der Tiere handelt es sich laut einer Studie des Bonner Komitees gegen den Vogelmord um Zugvögel, die in einigen Ländern akut gefährdet oder vom Aussterben bedroht sind. Neben Feldlerchen (900.000) und Kiebitzen (100.000) werden zum Beispiel auch Turteltauben (1,5 Millionen) gejagt: Vögel, die in Deutschland auf der Roten Liste gefährdeter Arten stehen.
&gt; 
&gt; Der Bestand der Turteltaube hat sich in Europa von 1980 bis 2013 um rund 80 Prozent verringert - mehr als 100 Millionen Tiere wurden in diesem Zeitraum abgeschossen. Turteltauben, Feldlerchen und Kiebitze dürfen nämlich bei ihrem Zug durch Südeuropa oder Frankreich ganz legal gejagt werden. In Deutschland wiederum ist die Jagd auf gefährdete Gänsearten aus Skandinavien und Osteuropa erlaubt. (Diese Meldung stammt aus dem SPIEGEL. Den neuen SPIEGEL finden Sie hier.)
&gt; 
&gt; Für die Studie wurden Zahlen aus 24 EU-Staaten sowie der Schweiz und Norwegen ausgewertet. Die Dunkelziffer liegt weitaus höher. Für Großbritannien, die Niederlande, Irland und Griechenland gab es keine Daten. Auch werden Wildvögel in großer Zahl illegal getötet oder gefangen. Grundlage für die legale Jagd ist die Europäische Vogelschutzrichtlinie, die 82 Vogelarten als ""jagdbar"" einstuft. Seit 1979 wurde die Liste nicht aktualisiert.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Die Jagd auf bestimmte Arten gefährdet die Schutzbemühungen in anderen Ländern oder macht sie komplett zunichte"", sagt Studienmitautor Axel Hirschfeld. So dürfen Turteltauben noch in zehn, Feldlerchen in sechs und Kiebitze in fünf EU-Ländern gejagt werden. Die EU-Kommission muss laut Hirschfeld handeln: ""Staaten, die weiterhin die Jagd auf gefährdete Arten erlauben, müssen dringend aufgefordert werden, diese Wildvögel zu schonen.""",True,0,1520075552,,False,0,dv4777t,True,t3_81pkb2,True,t3_81pkb2,/r/Jagd/comments/81pkb2/vogelschutz_tödliches_durcheinander_spiegelde/dv4777t/,1524764508,1,True,False,Jagd,t5_309h3,public,

Zorthianator_V2,ag,AarGUN,"It won't. 

Many Swiss politicians hate guns and have tried to impose stricter gun control laws by claiming that we had X or Y problem (always while moving goal posts). During the last vote, we didn't accept any new gun control.

This caused those anti-gun groups and politicians to become irrelevant. But ""luckily"" for them, the EU decided to enact stricter gun laws after Paris (the bodies weren't even cold and they were already presenting the new directives).

This gave the anti-gun politicians in Switzerland a new way of enacting gun control and then claim that the EU made them do it. It's also a lie that we would be kicked out of Schengen if we don't accept these new directives since there's no guillotine clause regarding them.

They are literally going against the will of people to enact these stupid gun laws that won't prevent anything.

Here's what one of the Swiss pro gun groups has to say about all this:

&gt; 1.
&gt; Die Schweiz verfügt bereits nachweislich1 über ein wirksames Waffengesetz, das den Anforderungen aus der EU-Waffenrichtlinie bereits mehr als entspricht. Somit genügt die Genehmigung des Notenaustausches, Änderungen am WG sind keine notwendig.
&gt; 
&gt; 2.
&gt; Der Absicht, den internationalen Terrorismus zu bekämpfen, dient der neue Gesetzesentwurf in keiner Art und Weise und ist damit als unverhältnismässig zurückzuweisen.
&gt; 
&gt; 3.
&gt; Die Änderung der EU-Waffenrichtlinie bezweckt Verbesserungen im Kampf gegen den Terror. Jedoch ist in der EU die Terrorabwehr in der Zuständigkeit der Einzelstaaten, nicht bei der EU2. Die Kommission ist also gar nicht dafür zuständig und hat hier ihre Kompetenzen klar überschritten.
&gt; 
&gt; 4.
&gt; Bei der Schengen-Abstimmung 2005 hat das Schweizer Volk die Feuerwaffenrichtlinie als «Mindestregeln gegen den Waffenmissbrauch»3 und als Massnahme zur Regulierung des grenzüberschreitenden Verkehrs und Handels4 angenommen. Es liegt somit für die jetzige, folgenschwere Gesetzesanpassung gar keine demokratische Legitimation vor.
&gt; 
&gt; 5.
&gt; Das Volk hat 2005 dem Beitritt zu Schengen und Dublin im Wissen zugestimmt, dass die Befürchtung für «einschneidende Beschränkungen in unserem Waffenrecht» «unbegründet» seien2. Das sind sie jetzt nachweislich nicht.
&gt; 
&gt; 6.
&gt; Die Anpassung des Schweizer Waffenrechts geschieht nicht im Einklang mit der Bundesverfassung zur Bekämpfung des Waffenmissbrauchs, sondern ohne die Vorlage von Fakten1 und ausschliesslich dem Diktat der EU folgend, was in einem sicherheitspolitisch sensiblen Bereich nicht toleriert werden kann.
&gt; 
&gt; Aspekte des Waffenerwerbes und -besitzes
&gt; 7.
&gt; Ein wesentlicher Teil der Gesetzesanpassungen basiert auf einer Unterscheidung zwischen Faust- und Handfeuerwaffen, deren Definition nirgends verbindlich erbracht wird5 und auf die sogar bisher im eidg. Waffengesetz bewusst verzichtet wurde.
&gt; 
&gt; 8.
&gt; Die Umteilung von bisher nur bewilligungspflichtigen zu verbotenen und somit ausnahmebewilligungspflichtigen Waffen aufgrund eines rechtlich nicht erfassten Magazins widerspricht gängiger Praxis sowie gesundem Menschenverstand6: Durch das Einsetzen eines bestimmten Magazins gilt die gesamte Waffe als verboten.
&gt; 
&gt; 9.
&gt; Das heutige Gesetz formuliert, dass Kantone Ausnahmebewilligungen erteilen KÖNNEN, was zu kantonal unterschiedlichen Auslegungen führt. Weil neu nun viel mehr Waffen – auch ganz normale Sport- und Sammlerwaffen – der Ausnahmebewilligungspflicht unterstehen, genügt eine solche «Kann»-Formulierung absolut nicht mehr. Aufkeimender «Kantönligeist» bei der Erteilung von Bewilligungen wäre gegenüber den Absichten des eidg. Waffengesetzes von 1999 ein Rückschritt.
&gt; 
&gt; 10.
&gt; Mit der Bestätigungspflicht von neu verbotenen Waffen wird eine Nachregistrierungspflicht unter anderem Namen eingeführt. Diese hat das Volk bereits 2011 und 2013 und das Parlament 2015 abgelehnt hat. Der Wille von Volk und Parlament wird somit übergangen.7
&gt; 
&gt; 11.
&gt; Künftig soll jede vom neuen Gesetz betroffene Waffe als Sammler- ODER als Sportwaffe bewilligt werden müssen. Was geschieht mit Sportschützen, die ihren Sport aufgeben? Müssen alle Waffen als Sammlerwaffen erneut bewilligt werden? Ein riesiges Bürokratiemonster wird geweckt!
&gt; 
&gt; 12.
&gt; Der Präzisierungsgrad des Gesetzesentwurfes ist wie vorgelegt zu gering, so dass die eigentliche Verschärfung erst in der Verordnung (wobei hierfür die Grundlage im Gesetz fehlt) oder durch die Gerichte zu erwarten ist, – damit wird die parlamentarische Gesetzgebung unterwandert und der verfassungsmässige Schutz vor Willkür nicht garantiert8.
&gt; 
&gt; Aspekte des sportlichen und freizeitlichen Schiessens
&gt; 13.
&gt; Im Breitensport werden künftig verbotene Waffen verwendet werden müssen, was den Anschein erweckt, dass Sportschützen auch etwas Verbotenes tun – das ist schädlich für die Schweizer Tradition des ausserdienstlichen bzw. des sportlichen Schiessens und widerspricht der Sportförderung gemäss Verfassung9.
&gt; 
&gt; 14.
&gt; Weder die Schützenvereine noch private Schiessanlagenbetreiber können und wollen die Verantwortung über die korrekte Erfüllung der Schiesspflicht übernehmen, zumal unklar ist, was «Regelmässigkeit des sportlichen Schiessens» genau bedeutet. Die diesbezügliche Umsetzung ist auch Nicoletta della Valle, Direktorin des Bundesamts für Polizei (fedpol) unklar, insbesondere auch die mit der Überprüfung verbundene Bürokratie.
&gt; 
&gt; 15.
&gt; Mit der Pflicht zum «regelmässigen sportlichen Schiessen» wird ein Bedürfnisnachweis eingeführt. Vor der Schengen-Abstimmung von 2005 wurde dem Stimmbürger versprochen: «Nach wie vor braucht es jedoch für den Erwerb einer Waffe keinen Bedürfnisnachweis.»10 Zudem ist es für die Terrorbekämpfung egal, wie gut ein Sportschütze schiessen kann, ausser die Sportschützen sollen selber die Terroristen bekämpfen.
&gt; 
&gt; 16.
&gt; Die vorhandenen bundeseigenen und privaten Schiessanlagen genügen technisch oder anzahlmässig den zukünftigen gesetzlich geforderten Ansprüchen nicht und müssten in unverhältnismässigem Umfang ausgebaut werden.
&gt; 
&gt; 17.
&gt; Die neue gesetzliche Pflicht zum regelmässigen Gebrauch der Waffe führt zu unnötig mehr privaten Waffen- und Munitionstransporten auf Strasse und Schiene.
&gt; 
&gt; Aspekte des Waffensammelns
&gt; 18.
&gt; Für Sammler wird die Darlegung des Zweckes verlangt. Wenn diese als Grundlage für die Entscheidung über das Gesuch dient, erwächst daraus ein Bedürfnisnachweis. Vor der Schengen-Abstimmung von 2005 wurde dem Stimmbürger jedoch versprochen: «Nach wie vor braucht es jedoch für den Erwerb einer Waffe keinen Bedürfnisnachweis.»
&gt; 
&gt; 19.
&gt; Der heutige Status eines ausnahmebewilligungsberechtigten Sammlers für verbotene Waffen und Waffenzubehör und die damit verbundenen Rechte und Pflichten darf nicht durch das Sportschützenwesen verwässert werden.
&gt; 
&gt; 20.
&gt; Es gibt keinen Anlass für erhöhte Anforderungen zur Aufbewahrung von Waffensammlungen, die heutigen Bestimmungen haben sich in der Praxis bewährt.

sub200ms,,,"&gt; Hmm, OK. Does Germany not care about it's £40bn trade surplus with the UK then?  
  
Yes they do, but is just that the German manufacturing industry are thinking ahead, since the Single Market is so much more important than the UK market.

[deleted],,,"Yeah I think the “unprepared” point is key. Many journalists (especially older ones who aren’t very Internet savvy) seem completely unaware of what the alt-right actually says online and believes. And then they usually just draw a facile comparison with Nazis and consider that to be sufficient criticism. The alt-right is, unfortunately, a fairly large movement and somewhat nebulous - you have to be plugged in to their favored Internet forums to really understand their motivations and beliefs. Also, they usually come armed with at least some “evidence” to support their beliefs — although their “evidence” could easily be attacked if the interviewers were merely prepared. Their evidence is usually either completely misinterpreted (by the alt-right), misleading, improperly divorced from its social or historical context, or sometimes just plain fabricated. But oftentimes journalists are so flummoxed when presented with this “evidence” and these arguments that they just let it go without comment (again, due to their own woeful lack of preparation). I remember the abhorrent Milo Y going on a news show and saying something about Muslim “rape gangs” in Europe and how “thousands” of women had been raped by these gangs. The other pundits just moved on immediately and tried to change the subject. They were either completely unprepared, or just not mentally agile enough, to counter him - so they let him get away with saying it without any rebuttal.

The freedom of religion as interpreted by most European and surprisingly, Indonesia, is the freedom of everyone to worship according to the faiths they please. Indonesia disallows atheism, but most European countries do allow it. 

However, as far as I understand it at least, Malaysia interprets freedom of religion as the right of any religious authorities to enact any administrative duties on its followers without being disrupted by the government, as long as it does not go against the secular law and the Constitution. 

Which is why forcing people to convert to Islam is slightly frowned upon in Islam. But enticing impressionable youngsters to join Islam as soon as they reach legal age of eighteen is seen as heroic and brave.

China has been in a trade war with us for years, they know it, we do to, but we have sat back and taken it for the most part. 

I'm not saying we should do it though. It could turn out harmful like other tariffs before them, but it is a policy which can be easily reversed if needed. The issue raised though is a very important topic which has just been accepted as part of the deal with China. I do think it's a tactic to get the conversation back into mainstream politics, where it's largely been ignored. China deserves any and all criticism for the fraud they continually get away with.

DEL-J,,,"What? Just no. I am part Cherokee and I have to say white people’s (I’m white, very minor Cherokee) understanding  of what actually went down is completely mischaracterized. First of all, Europeans didn’t intentionally destroy Americans when they got here. There were many attempts at cohabitation, but the relationship was contentious, and over the course of hundreds of years, Americans were pushed inland by the new settlers, it was wrong, absolutely, but it wasn’t this blatant, aggressive, unjustified American hunt that people love to talk about, not even close. Americans had the most problems with the Spanish, who actually were complete assholes, but that didn’t work out for Spain, because they were essentially ejected from North America and had to try again later. Meanwhile French and English settlers had a much more amicable relationship with Americans for many, many years with the occasional flash point conflict between them, but remember, the Americans were a very diverse group of people, while the French and English were different from each other and from Spain. The Spanish did some pretty fucking harsh shit for reasons I haven’t been able to figure out, yet. The worst thing the French and English did was leverage American tribes against each other, but that was something that was pragmatic and bound to happen anyway. American tribes were already trying to exterminate each other, and they attacked European settlers based on criteria that we wouldn’t find justifiable today, such as for trading with a tribe with which another tribe was at war. So, lines were drawn, American tribes were already fighting, but then expanded their fight to include Europeans, who were happy to leverage the tribes against each other. In addition to that, certain tribes, like my Cherokee ancestors, began selling land to European settlers, which did not sit well with conservatives, who hated, and didn’t even understand the concept of private property, so while policy makers in the tribes were selling land to settlers, other members of the tribe would raid these settlements and butcher them. THAT caused a large amount of contention between the colonies and the American tribes. Anyway, point is, other than with the Spanish, it’s really not how people like to think of the situation. Very gray, very pragmatic, very in keeping with the times.

BritRedditor1,,(((neoliberal))) [metropolitan] [globalist] Shareholder PRIMACY,"A group of UK academics this month wrote an open letter to a British Sunday newspaper expressing their enthusiasm for leaving the EU.

Headlined “Brainy Brits come out for Brexit” it had perhaps the personal sub-text that Brexiters are fed up with Remainers characterising them as mince-thick peasants with the dimmest of ideas how the world wags.

“We’re not all mince-thick peasants,” their letter seemed to pipe plaintively. “We’ve got postgraduate degrees and mortar boards and everything — and we still want to leave the EU.”

Now, with a certain inevitability, dons on the other side of the argument have piled in with their own open letter to the same paper. This one, obviously, is “Brains for Remain”. And it does not even bother trying to mount an argument: 1,406 academics have put their names to a letter that simply says: “You report that ‘nearly 40’ academics have come together in support of Brexit. We would like you to know that there are very many more who are of the opposite view.”

Would the issue be resolved to everyone’s satisfaction, I wonder, if next week Mensa, the club for people who have paid for a bit of paper certifying that they are clever, weighs in? My hunch is it would not.

So what, in terms of persuasion, is going on? Not much.

The first letter has a probable psychological explanation rather than a persuasive agenda — the authors are simply fed up with being portrayed as dim. And the second letter, I guess, has the explanation that its authors mostly wanted to annoy the authors of the first. But in terms of the argument neither of them gets us anywhere.

There are lots of people with academic jobs knocking about the place. Boasting looks a bit naff — and, as any fool knows, the most effective ethos appeal in politics is usually to address the public as an equal, rather than, with what ever justice, vaunting a superior qualification.

The idea that if lots of people think the same thing they are more likely to be right is, as many of these dons presumably know, an instance of the informal fallacy called argumentum ad populum, or argument to the people. And the idea that if important people believe something, it is more likely to be right is an instance of the informal fallacy called argumentum ad verecundiam — or argument from authority. Combining the two takes a special sort of inanity.

It is especially unpersuasive in this case because the UK’s current bitter political state is largely down to people on both sides of the argument saying that people on the other are stupid.

Confirmation bias and the so-called backfire effect — where opposition causes people to double down on a belief — have been widely and unhelpfully in evidence.

How many Remainers do we think will have changed their minds on reading “Brainy Brits for Brexit”? How many Leavers do we think will have changed their minds on meeting these “Brains for Remain”? Rather, each side will dig deeper into their foxholes, satisfied that these dons have confirmed their essential rightness simply by agreeing with them while being officially clever.

In his book Enlightenment Now, Steven Pinker, the cognitive scientist, draws attention to what he calls “expressive rationality”. We are tribes first and thinkers second: rather than choosing sides on the basis of the argument we support, we make arguments as a way of signalling which side we are on. Something of that is going on here.

Brexit, as many supporters have framed it, was in large part a vote against group-thinking elitists who think they know better than the ordinary voter. So it is hard to see how supporters will now be won for Remain by 1,406 dons publicly telling them, effectively: “We’re cleverer than normal people and we all think the same thing.”

BaronBifford,,Progressive ,"&gt; It’s unfair to people, like my own parents, who spent a ton of money and time to LEGALLY immigrate to the US.

I should point that illegal immigrants often spend fortunes to get to their destinations because they have to use people-smugglers who charge huge amounts of money (and when the migrants can't pay they get tortured or raped or sold into slavery or whatever).  This is at least true for African immigrants who try to get into Europe.  It's so much cheaper to just hop on a plane, if only one can get a visa.  I read that illegals from Africa to Europe spend THOUSANDS of euros to get there, whereas a legal plane ride costs only a couple hundred or less.

On another note, while it might feel unfair to those who made the effort to come in legally, illegal immigration doesn't actually *harm* your parents, does it?  They might feel a little indignant, but it's not hitting their wallets or anything, right?

&gt; Him building a wall on the Mexican and American border is great.

I read somewhere that immigration from Mexico is going down and that the largest share of illegals are from Asia.  They come here legally then overstay their visas.  A wall against Mexico won't help with that.

I think a wall COULD work against Mexican immigrants, because the Communists build a fairly effective Iron Curtain across Europe.  But Mexico is no longer the biggest source so the barrier would be in the wrong place.

Now a note about empathy: liberals argue in defense of illegals on the grounds of compassion, as in ""deportation will wreck families"" or somesuch, whereas conservatives argue on the **principle** that illegals should get kicked.  It's ""the law is the law"" vs ""have a heart"".  That's why they want DACA so that illegal immigrants kids can become legal.  Because it sucks to deport kids.

&gt; It’s not racism to say you do not want illegals.

Whilst I have no doubt we have some stake in elections overseas, the level of involvement is staggering different as are the methods. When I said eastern states were ""seeded with sympathies"" I meant it literally. the USSR displaced it's own citizens to create resident sympathies to accelerate cultural integration. It's not that countries have populations that want closer relations, a lot of the truly indigenous people want less to do with Russia, it's the children and grandchildren who see themselves, rightfully, as Russian. This was a planned strategy to keep a resident force in the country and is a part of the reason the invasion of Ukraine was so successful. I'd have no problem with this if Russia didn't leverage these people in it's own interests presently as well. Russia should admit these people are no longer it's citizens and should stop using them as a battering ram.


&gt;Military action

Setting up missile ""defences"" AKA launch sites, but ensuring they can be loaded with ICBMs as well as (many times instead of) interceptor missiles. I have no problem with defensive actions but that is just blatantly not the case. These are sites intended to aggress should the need arise, and to intimidate else-wise. Also, aiding a Middle Eastern dictator is hardly what I would call positive diplomacy. They are not only helping support a terrible regime but they only did it in the first place to engage in a proxy war with the US. 

&gt;I think media helps portray this image of fear and paranoia. Personally I don't. I'll fear them when they cross a certain line, like invade a country. But for now, I don't see them as a threat at all. Their military is nothing compared to America, they spend 10 percent of America's budget. Their country is completely surrounded by the West. I see them as a bear backed in a corner that the West keeps prodding with a stick. Will the bear lash out? They sort of did in Crimea, but like I said above, I believe that action can be justified.

This, right here, is where your pretty own sympathies are showing. You are actually *weirdly* pro-Russia, the sort of person who watches YouTube videos of Putin because ""he's an interesting speaker"". You want them invading another country? They literally have already done that [5 times since 1992.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_military_occupations). You want to talk about the effects of media propaganda, you seem to have absorbed quite a bit yourself especially if you don't consider Russias military particularly lethal. For what it's worth, in a ground war Russia would win hands down. They don't *need* to spend as much as America does and ""they're only as bad as America"" is a pretty poor line to draw considering we're only safe from America because we have a similar relationship as I quoted Russia would want - they hold the cards. If America wants something from us do not delude yourself into thinking they won't get it.

danhalen138,,,"You’re getting a lot of hate in this thread but I’d like to offer a data point.

I’m currently in my final semester of an MBA program at the top university in Taiwan (not China, depending on who you ask, but significant cultural similarities including education).

Our program consists of half Taiwanese and half international students from all over the world.

This is a prestigious program here but the curriculum is pretty much a joke and is a total breeze even for someone like me with a non-business undergraduate. The students from western countries (I don’t mean white people, I mean people of all ethnicities from North America and Europe) drastically outperform the Eastern Asian students.

Of course this is anectodal but it seems while not lacking in intelligence, there is a lack of critical thinking skills. Even discussing with some of my local classmates they’ve explained they are taught what to think, not how to think. I’ve seen it in my classes as well. For example when learning about regression analysis in statistics the professor basically has us put all the variables into the program and tells us what to look for in an r value. We don’t really spend much time to learn the underlying reasoning of what makes a good variable and how to properly analyze the data.

There’s a reason why tons of universities in the East are trying to cultivate western style programs and no one in the West is trying to start asian style programs.

Personally I think immigrants in the US tend to place a higher emphasis on education and familial stability which results in higher achieving kids. Thus we get then”smart asian” stereotype.

Just my 2 cents based on my experience.

An afterthought based on not much: I’ve wondered if the education style is reflective of the language. Anyone who has studied Chinese knows its a ton of just raw memorization and repetition. As language tends to be one of the first things learned through formal education, perhaps that style of learning influences the way other subjects are taught.",True,0,1520096395,,False,0,dv4ju48,False,t3_81pj3w,True,t1_dv4eaq7,/r/pics/comments/81pj3w/entrance_exam_for_an_art_school_in_china/dv4ju48/,1524770605,3,True,False,pics,t5_2qh0u,public,

The only real effort in Iraq was to get the oil fields running again, for US companies. Or did I somehow miss that Iraq was suddenly a beacon of economic activity after the US ousted Saddam Hussein?

As for Yugoslavia (where I am from), I would argue that the authoritarian makeup of your typical Stalinist one party state lends itself inherently to strongman politics and utter corruption that follows with it (either ideological or personal). So when the dictator is gone then the rats don't have to pretend to be subservient anymore and start vying for the whole pie.

WillTriggerYou,,,"Je pense qu'il y a plusieurs raison pour ça:

&amp;nbsp;

Si d'une part il n'y a que très peu de gens qui nient le fait que le climat est en train de changer (même chez les conservateurs américains), la question de savoir quelle en est la cause, dans quelle proportion l'activité humaine est impliquée (évidement, elle l'est, mais à quel point?), quelles-sont nos options, laquelle de ces options est la meilleure, mais surtout... Est-ce qu'il est encore possible de faire quelque chose pour renverser, ou du moins stopper les changements climatiques? Ce ne sont pas des questions simples et personne n'a de réponse définitive.

&amp;nbsp;

Donc, non seulement, on (l'humanité) n'arrive pas à s'entendre sur les questions fondamentales du genre ""Quelles sont les causes"" et ""Est-ce de notre faute?"", mais en plus, on n'arrive pas à s'entendre sur les solutions à prendre. C'est facile de dire ""On va signer un accord pour réduire les gaz à effet de serre"", mais la réalité est que  même si on éliminait **100%** de nos émissions de CO2, ce ne serait pas suffisant pour renverser la situation. Non seulement, ce ne serait pas suffisant pour la renverser, mais ce ne serait même pas suffisant pour arrêter complètement le réchauffement climatique.

http://theconversation.com/if-we-stopped-emitting-greenhouse-gases-right-now-would-we-stop-climate-change-78882

&gt;So if we stop emitting carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels today, it’s not the end of the story for global warming. There’s a delay in air-temperature increase as the atmosphere catches up with all the heat that the Earth has accumulated. After maybe 40 more years, scientists hypothesize the climate will stabilize at a temperature higher than what was normal for previous generations.

&amp;nbsp;

Ensuite ce n'est pas tout. C'est facile de critiquer ceux qui sont réticents à changer nos habitudes à cause des arguments économiques et d'avoir l'air vertueux, mais la réalité est que les plus gros pollueurs au monde ne sont pas l'Europe et l'Amérique du Nord, mais bien la Chine et l'Inde est aussi en voie de le devenir. Le problème avec ça c'est que c'est l'industrialisation rapide récente qui leur a permis de se sortir de l'extrême pauvreté. À moins d'une percée technologique majeure à court terme, le prix à payer pour ces pays-là s'ils veulent participer activement à stopper le changement climatique de manière efficace sera de revenir à leurs niveaux de vie pré-1960, c'est à dire la quasi-famine... Donc bonne chance pour les convaincre.

&amp;nbsp;

Tous les pays développés font un effort. Et, ça inclus les États-Unis qui malgré leur sortie de l'Accord de Paris ont pas mal respecté leurs engagements. Le problème c'est que ces engagements, à part se donner bonne conscience sont loin d'être suffisants pour faire une différence significative. Si on veut faire une différence suffisante pour stopper ou même juste ralentir les changements climatiques (pas juste pour la Chine et l'Inde, mais pour tout le monde), le prix à payer ne sera pas juste quelques profits pour les grandes pétrolières... Chaque être humain va payer un prix immense en qualité de vie... À un tel point que bien des pays qui commençaient à s'en sortir vont revenir à un niveau de pauvreté qui frôle la famine.

&amp;nbsp;

Donc c'est plate, mais on ne renversera jamais la situation. On ne va probablement même pas arrêter les changements climatiques... Je doute même qu'on aille jusqu'à les ralentir. Je sais que ça sonne pessimiste, mais en même temps on est pas à 5 ans de l'extinction humaine. On va réussir à survivre dans les conditions qui s'en viennent pour probablement au moins quelques centaines d'années... On ne va pas arrêter les changements climatiques, on va juste apprendre à vivre avec.

I don't think any of the separatist movements in Spain will succeed, simply because it's clear that the Spanish government won't let them and won't shy away from using pretty repressive methods to do so.

Scotland and NI might have a chance if Brexit goes really badly and if the British government allows them a referendum.

Pretty conflicted. On one hand, I'm generally in favour of self-determination principle and I think the ideal solution to these issues in European democratic countries in the context of 21st centure should be a referendum and also from the experience of my country, I know that a quick, painless split is possible. On the other hand I realize that referenda can be a target of manipulation, that the Czechoslovak example isn't applicable everywhere, and that it could possible throw the respective countries into an instability.

So I'm not really sure what would be the ideal way to handle it.

bayarea415,Default,3L,"Arlighty you purposeful dense troglodyte who never opened a civics book before and never learned how taxes work, let me break it down for you. 

A government collects money from a portion of its populace income to fund public goods like streets, mail, and parks. A government funds basic goods and welfare services as well so the lowest of their society do not die to meaningless causes, and can have the opportunity to grow. 

Education from K-12 is one of those basic goods provided to you by the government. And if the public decides that the costs of private higher education is too high, they can ask for the government to require all public universities to be free through allocating their budget the billions that they need. And they can raise taxes for those who are well off.

This not only happens in Europe, [but California as well, where proposition 30 was passed with 55% of the vote:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_30,_2012)

&gt; Proposition 30 provides for a personal income tax increase over seven years for California residents with an annual income over US$250,000, to be implemented retroactively starting January 1, 2012 through the end of 2018.[4] The measure also provides for an increase in the state sales tax by 0.25 percent over four years (from January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2016).

&gt; The windfall will generate between $4 billion and $9 billion annually for the state general fund, according to the independent state Legislative Analyst’s Office.

So my question is, how can a 3L like you not understand this damn BASIC function of our society, and still think short-sighted libertarian philosophies can still hold water under these FACTS.

bridges462,,,"To be sure, oppression is not a white invention. Oppression is a human invention. My post focused on white oppression because the history of Canada is rooted in the oppression carried out by white European males over the last few hundreds of years.

Appeals to biology are very problematic. As a matter of fact, there are biological differences between males and females: hormones, reproduction organs, and so forth. However, nothing about those biological differences inherently justifies the exclusion of women, for example, from participating in the development of political institutions throughout history. But history shows that political institutions are crafted by those in power and have been crafted to keep those without power powerless. There is no biological reason for why the experience of the woman has been historically devalued. Appeals to biology, then, amount to flawed justifications by those in power of the power that they wield. 

Case in point: the 'ideal' individual is rational, focused on rights, and so forth. Emotions are traditionally understood as counter-productive to rationality. Is it a coincidence that women have been viewed as more emotional than men and that emotions weaken the expression of individuality in our political institutions? No. The concept of the rational individual that dominates our political and legal institutions is an act of oppression perpetrated by those in power - white males - against those without power. The experiences of the woman or the indigenous person remain secondary to the experience of the white male.

I am not claiming that we do away with the concept of the individual. But until we fully recognize the violence done by our institutions and our language against those without power, even in concepts or laws that appear to be unbiased, oppression will continue.",True,0,1520101164,,1520101480,0,dv4nxrx,False,t3_818xbu,True,t1_dv4ebx4,/r/canada/comments/818xbu/antiwhiteness_canadian_university_event_mired_in/dv4nxrx/,1524772587,1,True,False,canada,t5_2qh68,public,

En resumen, esta clase de discusiones me parece una estupidez enorme, Imperios en África y Asia se alzaron con tanta riqueza  como los reinos Europeos (Imperio Mali, Otomano, Mongol, Dinastias Chinas)

Las razones de porque los países europeos triunfaron finalmente son diversas, una de las principales es que los reinos europeos estaban completamente al lado uno de los otros, a diferencia de los asiáticos o africanos, que vivían miles de kilómetros los unos de los otros. Es mas fácil dominar y saquear tribus y naciones que están lejos, los reinos no gastaban mucho en defensa, y eso facilitaba a algunos ingeniosos a formar enormes imperios que cubrían todo el continente, con un simple puñado de arqueros a caballo. 

Los europeos en cambio, como son todos vecinos, crearon fortificaciones enormes, castillos, murallas, armas de asedio, y nuevos métodos de hacer la guerra. Hasta forjaron alianzas con otros reinos/ducados cercanos, o juraban lealtad a un Rey o en su caso al Papa, que servia de mediador... (véase que algo similar le paso a Japón, un país formado de la guerra entre diversos señores feudales, lo que creo una cultura bélica que se vio traducido en soldados cubiertos de metal, protegiendo castillos enormes, teniendo un Emperador finalmente como jefe de Estado, o un Shogun. Y cuando se cansaron de matarse entre ellos, salieron a hacer mierda Asia)

&gt;It's my understanding that pageantry and ""fluff"" were very much part of war up until (roughly) WWI. It was only when war became a fully mechanized slaughter that the image of a ""chivalrous duel"" was really thrown out.

Displaying social status by wearing expensive clothing is quite another thing from deliberately handicapping one's self for the sake of ""honor."" ""Chivalrous duel"" is a very poor description of medieval and early modern warfare. The core of medieval warfare was economic destruction and the reduction of strongpoints: hardly the most idealistic form of war.

&gt;And many...well soldiers isn't a good word for them. Serf army, maybe? Well, the largest bulk of a lot of armies were barely armed peasants with little to no armor. It was only until later periods that lords would have an armory (depending on location, of course) to outfit the military.

Oh boy. Medieval soldiers were almost never serfs, and lords were only responsible for the equipment of their personal retainers, who could hardly be described as barely armed. Medieval armies drew mainly from the upper ranks of society: rich peasants and aristocrats, later increasingly from mercenaries.

You would expect the countries with more Street View miles to show up more if Geoguesser is randomly dropping you somewhere with Street View access.

Back to my original point, I bet size in square miles correlates with Street View miles, but isn't exact. I wouldn't be surprised if the United States was ""Street View bigger"" than both Russia and Canada, simply because of the amount of empty space in those countries.

OdeToLiberty,,,"&gt; Those 'democracies' were as much actual democracies as modern Russia.

So conquest, coups, and regime change are meaningless because the subject of these was not a 'real democracy'?

&gt; So what - is a free country.

And if Russia and Canada signed a deal bringing Canada away from NAFTA and towards a Russian deal, you think the US would be okay with that?

&gt; You mean the Russian stooges

What...? It's clear that you know very little about the Ukrainian situation as the protesters were not 'Russian stooges', they were anti-Russian protesters supported by the US and the EU...

&gt; That's what all imperialists say

[94% of Crimean people voted for the restoration of the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_sovereignty_referendum,_1991), which was its name when it was apart of the Russian SFSR.

[More than 58% of Crimea is self-identified 'ethnically Russian'.](http://america.aljazeera.com/multimedia/2014/3/map-russian-the-dominantlanguageincrimea.html)

Anyone who has ever looked into this knows that Russia has the best claim to ownership of Crimea.

&gt; LOL - oh yes, this is a good justification for a violent invasion of another country. If some Russian has a 'lease' in Denmark I guess its OK for them to invade them too.

Please stop being purposely obtuse and use your brain. Russia has a lease on the warm water port of Sevastopol, this is Russia's only warm water port in this area on which they have a naval base. This lease, and Russia's access to the Black Sea itself, is called into question when an anti-Russian mob overthrows the legitimate Ukrainian government during anti-Russian protests.

&gt; Yes

I have a feeling that you have absolutely no clue as to what is going on in Russia, Ukraine, or Crimea. You have never really looked into it, I can almost guarantee that.

Sedai02,Glenn,Metacanadian,"OVER the past year Australia has been gripped by a tale of suspicion, subversion and spooks. In the latest chapter Sam Dastyari, a Labor Party politician of Iranian extraction, resigned from parliament on December 12th. A recording had emerged of him urging Australia to “respect” China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea, contradicting the policy of both the government and his own party, and confirming earlier allegations against him. He also tried to stop his party’s foreign-affairs spokesperson meeting a pro-democracy activist in Hong Kong. A year earlier he had been forced to leave his opposition post, after revelations that he had taken money from Huang Xiangmo, a Chinese businessman with apparent links to the Chinese Communist Party, at the same time as he supported China’s territorial claims.

Widespread evidence of Chinese meddling in politics and universities prompted an Australian spy chief to warn that his country was facing “an unprecedented scale” of foreign interference. The country’s prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, is clearly worried. Further revelations showed that two Chinese companies, one run by Mr Huang, had (legally) donated A$6.7m ($5m) over a decade to Australia’s two main political parties. On December 5th the government announced legislation banning political donations from non-citizens and requiring political lobbyists to reveal if they are working for foreigners.

Australia is not alone. In September the Financial Times reported that a New Zealand MP had taught at a Chinese spy college for years but had left that information off his CV when he later applied for citizenship. That prompted growing calls for more scrutiny of China’s influence over the Chinese diaspora in New Zealand. Canada’s intelligence services have long been worried about infiltration: in 2010 they warned that several provincial cabinet ministers and government employees were “agents of influence”.

China seems to have been busy in Europe, too. Germany’s spy agency this week accused it of using social media to contact 10,000 German citizens, including lawmakers and civil servants, in the hope of “gleaning information and recruiting sources”. There have been reports of Chinese agents trying to groom up-and-coming politicians from Britain, especially those with business links to the country. And on December 13th America started to learn of possible intervention, when the Congressional Executive Commission on China began hearings to look into Chinese attempts to win political sway.

Piercing, not soft

China’s approach could be called “sharp power”. It stops well short of the hard power, wielded through military force or economic muscle; but it is distinct from the soft attraction of culture and values, and more malign. Sharp power is a term coined by the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), a foundation and think-tank in Washington, DC, funded mainly by Congress. It works by manipulation and pressure. Anne-Marie Brady of the University of Canterbury in New Zealand refers to China’s intrusions as a “new global battle” to “guide, buy or coerce political influence”.

The result is different from the cold war—less dangerous, but harder to deal with. Whereas the Soviet Union and the West were sworn enemies, China is a keenly courted trading partner that is investing huge sums beyond its borders (see chart 1). This naturally gives it influence, which it is using to shape debate abroad in areas where it wants to muzzle criticism, such as its political system, human-rights abuses and expansive territorial claims. It especially wants to stifle discussion of the Dalai Lama, Falun Gong, an outlawed spiritual movement, and the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.

China is hardly alone in trying to shape how the world sees it. And its sharp power, though growing rapidly, is not its first attempt at the game. Over the years China has often tried to silence criticism of its politics by denying visas to critical journalists and academics and by giving a cold-shoulder to unsympathetic governments and firms. It has also attempted to monitor and control ethnic Chinese living outside the country, using Chinese-language media and China-backed community groups.

China has long used soft power, too. Roughly 500 government-funded and government-staffed Confucius Institutes operate in universities and 1,000 “Confucius classrooms” in schools around the world, mostly in rich countries. The institutes do a good job of teaching Chinese to foreigners but they would be unlikely to convince students in the West that China’s authoritarianism is admirable, even if they tried.

Sharp power wraps all that up in something altogether more sinister. It seeks to penetrate and subvert politics, media and academia, surreptitiously promoting a positive image of the country, and misrepresenting and distorting information to suppress dissent and debate. China’s sharp power has three striking characteristics—it is pervasive, it breeds self-censorship and it is hard to nail down proof that it is the work of the Chinese state.",True,0,1520106593,,False,0,dv4sp4u,True,t3_81shlh,True,t3_81shlh,/r/metacanada/comments/81shlh/this_discussion_wasnt_allowed_in_rcanada_how/dv4sp4u/,1524775013,6,True,False,metacanada,t5_2sh5g,public,

SAGA-Coderis,,,"Bombing is a whole other problem and off topic to the theme in our argument. No need for a strawman... That's related to Middle East extremists and their ""war"" with the West. Furthermore it's rare and even with clash of cultures with Middle East fanatics the casualties are still much lower than casualties from gun kills in the US. But if we go back to topic... I have a question for you. These cases where the criminals kill just for the sake of killing, do you think they outnumber the cases where criminals only want to steal, but end up killing innocents because they know they otherwise would have been shot instead? These cases where regular burglars are turned into killers because of the American system is a shame. I'm aware Australia got some problems from their transition but it's not static. It's a step for a safer future for citizens. It will improve with time when fewer and fewer can get their hands on guns. Will you really let Texas decide for the whole country? It's one state. With time they will learn the value of life as well. Size of country has nothing to do with this. It's just a horrible warrant to leave things at it is. You got states and all with functional law enforcement. There lives 741 million people in Europe where gun laws work. (Some East European countries got worse law enforcement but nevertheless still fewer gun kills than the US Per capita.). There lives only 323 million people in USA in comparison. In China they live even more people and they have fewer gun kills than the US too. They are a completely different culture though while the US is still relatively similar to most of Europe.

The linesman alone secured your victory by falsely blowing off Ronaldo, not to mention all the atrocious decisions by the main referee. 2011 was even worse. 

And trust me, I'm not fucking biased in this case. My hatred for United runs deeper than anything else. But, they were robbed versus you lot. And for that, I'm grateful. 

&gt; And fucking haha if you think Messi and Iniesta are going to struggle against Stoke or Newcastle (no offence)

They absolutely would. Especially without the doping they had back in their glory days. 

&gt;hey have faced more physical teams (Espanyol and many other spanish teams are physical, unlike what people think, that La Liga is all technique) and better defensive teams (Atleti is better defensively than all PL)

Both of those are patently false. It's painfully obvious you've never been to a PL match, so don't make statements like this. It's just embarrassing. 
 
&gt;And if Silva could do it, then Iniesta, who is a much better player, can do it too.

Silva is better suited to the PL than Iniesta. 

&gt;And let's not even talk about Messi, because you are a moron if you think he can't do the same in England, who is going to stop him? 

Again, your complete ignorance is embarrassing. Messi wouldn't do the same, as he'd be fucking mauled. Especially back in the early 2000s. Can't break goalscoring records from the medical room.

The current global steel glut is due to overcapacity in China, which is a state-directed economy and not a market economy. The US has already imposed punitive tariffs on Chinese steel, while the UK prevented the EU from introducing similar measures. 

That means that Europe will be flooded with cheap Chinese steel that can't be sold in the US. At the same time, European exports are hit by US tariffs.

xhumptyDumptyx,eng-math,All things must pass,"My problem with these ""redpills"" is that they're lazy. It doesn't seem like you're just putting up facts with no bias, it seems like you have some biased viewpoint, yet you haven't explained any of these redpills at all. I know that many of these are probably memes, but if you're taking them seriously why not explain them.

What's the point of including the first 3 population projection ones?

- You seem to be implying that a smaller ratio of white people is a bad thing, but why is it? Especially when most of these non-white people are living in a completely different part of the world.

- The human accomplishments thing is true, but why do you think that is? There are a million factors that contribute to this. I don't understand what your point is by putting up random stats or saying that the west has accomplished the most. Also how is this a red pill, I'm fairly sure most people know this. (and probably the population thing too, I think it's common knowledge that people in other poorer countries usually reproduce at a faster rate than 1st world countries).

- The classrooms thing isn't even strictly true, there are many European countries that are basically all white, and even in Canada and the US there are plenty of areas that are almost all white. 

&gt; le ""south Africans...""

- The South Africa thing might be a serious issue, I'll definitely take a look at that later. The meme is dumb though, being from a country isn't the same as being a particular type of animal (although you may disagree with me on this point).

&gt; le mass migration always helps the economy

&gt; le ""banning ""hate"" speech isn't an act of violence""

- Technically speaking banning it isn't an act of violence, enforcing it is. This might just be me being nitpicky, but you could easily explain that enforcing it is an act of violence with a few more words and it's much more understandable this way.

&gt; le ""muh diversity""

NCX,,HP 24 Eny+Viewsonic VP2780-4K+X-Star DP2710: Glossy &amp; PWM Free,"&gt;what makes this monitor better than other 4K monitors?

There has been an obvious effort to promote the 27UK650 in multiple useless threads about it being available, and from posters claiming it's great without a proper review to back up their claims.  The HDR standard requires 1000cdm/2 brightness, a 10 bit panel and 100% DCI-P3 color space coverage.  Only two 1000$ 4K displays meet &gt;50% of the standard so far.


The 27UK650 claims to support HDR, but can only muster 450cdm/2 maximum brightness, and LG does not even advertise that it supports a certain amount of DCI-P3 color space because it's likely just another re-skin of the 27UD68 &amp; 69.  LG advertise 99% sRGB color space coverage, but there are multiple sub-300$ monitors which also do.  Companies confident in extended color space coverage at minimum advertise 125% sRGB coverage.


The LG 32UD99 is the cheapest 4K monitor with worthwhile HDR with its 550cdm/2 maximum brightness, 1400-2000:1 contrast and &gt;95% DCI-P3 color space coverage.  There is absolutely zero solid reasoning to think the 27UK650 is a great monitor, or a monitor with good HDR support.  It's probably good and extremely similar to the 27UD69P-W and 27UD68, but the tested 27"" 4K LG monitors are provably less accurate than multiple similarly priced competitors.

&gt;Max:500€

Save up an extra 50€ for the Asus PG27UQ which is only available in Australia and some countries in Europe.  It's one of the most accurate 27"" 4K monitors, supports Free-Sync over HDMI (the 1X supports it, hopefully the Pro will this year), has a height adjustable stand, 4x USB 3.0 ports and a new AHVA panel (marketed as IPS) with less glow than competing IPS competitors.  The Viewsonic VP2780-4K (14 bit 3D LUT) and Viewsonic XG2700-4K is the PG27UQ's main color accuracy competitors, but they do not use a low glow AHVA panel.

dynoseverything,,,"Say friend, did you know that the US Standard railroad gauge (distance between the rails) is 4 feet, 8 1/2 inches. 

That's an exceedingly odd number. Why was that gauge used? 

Because that's the way they built them in England, and the US railroads were built by English expatriates. 

I see, but why did the English build them like that? 

Because the first railway lines were built by the same people who built the pre-railroad tramways, and that's the gauge they used. 

Well, why did they use that gauge in England? 

Because the people who built the tramways used the same jigs and tools that they used for building wagons, which used that wheel spacing. 

Okay! Why did their wagons use that odd wheel spacing? 

Because, if they tried to use any other spacing the wagon wheels would break on some of the old, long distance roads. Because that's the spacing of the old wheel ruts. 

So who built these old rutted roads? 

The first long distance roads in Europe were built by Imperial Rome for the benefit of their legions. The Roman roads have been used ever since. 

And the ruts? 

The original ruts, which everyone else had to match for fear of destroying their wagons, were first made by the wheels of Roman war chariots. Since the chariots were made for or by Imperial Rome they were all alike in the matter of wheel spacing. 

Thus, we have the answer to the original question. The United States standard railroad gauge of 4 feet, 8 1/2 inches derives from the original specification for an Imperial Roman army war chariot. 

And the motto of the story is Specifications and bureaucracies live forever. 

So, the next time you are handed a specification and wonder what horse's ass came up with it, you may be exactly right. Because the Imperial Roman chariots were made to be just wide enough to accommodate the back-ends of two war-horses. 

So, just what does this have to do with the exploration of space? 

Well, there's an interesting extension of the story about railroad gauge and horses' behinds. When we see a Space Shuttle sitting on the launch pad, there are two big booster rockets attached to the sides of the main fuel tank. These are the solid rocket boosters, or SRBs. The SRBs are made by Thiokol at a factory in Utah. The engineers who designed the SRBs might have preferred to make them a bit fatter, but the SRBs had to be shipped by train from the factory to the launch site. 

The railroad from the factory runs through a tunnel in the mountains. The SRBs had to fit through that tunnel. The tunnel is slightly wider than a railroad track, and the railroad track is about as wide as two horses' behinds. 

So a major design feature of what is arguably the world's most advanced transportation system was originally determined by the width of a horse's ass.",True,0,1520118069,,False,0,dv52jdg,False,t3_81pfg3,False,t3_81pfg3,/r/AskReddit/comments/81pfg3/whats_best_example_of_butterfly_effect/dv52jdg/,1524780844,12,True,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,public,

WikiTextBot,,,"**Harry Roseland**

Harry Herman Roseland (c.1867—1950) was one of the most notable painters of the genre painting school around the turn of the 20th century. An American, Roseland was primarily known for paintings centered on poor African-Americans.

Roseland was largely self-taught, and never traveled to Europe to study art, as did many of the American artists of his time. However, he did receive instruction from John Bernard Whittaker and later, James Carroll Beckwith.

The only way a war breaks out between Canada and my home country  is if one or the other is no longer my home...

Because if Ireland started the war then it would mean they had torn up the Irish constitution and wiped their ass with it... and if Canada started it then it would be a war crime.

Because even theoretically war can't break out. It is actually impossible for my home country to go to war. Ireland's constitution is quite explicit that it is 100% illegal for Ireland to for any reason enter an offensive entanglement. 

Thus the only reason they'd go to war would be if Canada invaded Ireland. In which case why would I fight? Canada is obviously the bad guy in that scenario... they're invading a country 1/10th their size in what *by necessity* would be a war of aggression because of the nature of the Irish constitution. It'd also be WW3 and the end of NATO because of the EU but besides that...

So would I fight in an illegal war? No. Canada invading defenceless nations in acts of aggressive conquest is not something I would ever support, Ireland's constitution being thrown out makes in no longer my home country now doesn't it?

Sigismund of Luxembourg (15 February 1368 – 9 December 1437) was Prince-elector of Brandenburg from 1378 until 1388 and from 1411 until 1415, King of Hungary and Croatia from 1387, King of Germany from 1411, King of Bohemia from 1419, King of Italy from 1431, and Holy Roman Emperor for four years from 1433 until 1437, the last male member of the House of Luxembourg. Sigismund von Luxembourg was the leader of the last West European Crusade - the Crusade of Nicopolis of 1396 to liberate Bulgaria and save Constantinople from the Turks. Afterwards, he founded the Dragon Order to fight the Turks. He was regarded as highly educated, spoke several languages (among them; French, German, Hungarian, Italian, and Latin) and was an outgoing person who also took pleasure in the tournament.

The myth of the flat Earth is the modern misconception that the prevailing cosmological view during the Middle Ages in Europe was that the Earth is flat, instead of spherical.[1][2]

During the early Middle Ages, virtually all scholars maintained the spherical viewpoint first expressed by the Ancient Greeks. From at least the 14th century, belief in a flat Earth among the educated was almost nonexistent, despite fanciful depictions in art, such as the exterior of Hieronymus Bosch's famous triptych The Garden of Earthly Delights, in which a disc-shaped Earth is shown floating inside a transparent sphere.[3]

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/4bd63628c99e4143b922a73b6d6216e2.png)  

&gt; Deadly Hunta brings immense raw energy to his performances, fusing Dancehall, Hiphop and Reggae, gripping audiences worldwide with the power of his dynamic lyrics. From backing Reggae legends such as Buju Banton and Hip Hop legends such as Wu Tang and Ice T, to performing alongside the Supernaturals on there US tour, Deadly has built up huge credibility throughout the UK Hip Hop and Reggae scenes. 

&gt; This is evident from the response received after touring with DJ Skitz on the homegrown tour 2006 as well as the reaction from the crowds at the LoveBox festival, Womad and the audience at the BBC Electric Proms. Deadly is showing no signs of slowing down: the release of his debut single ""Talk Out Loud"" has received massive airplay on Sky Soccer AM show, the music video for ""Talk Out Loud"" has been playlisted on MTVBase and Channel U as well as getting airplay on many of the pirate radio stations thoughout London and the UK. 

&gt; With various other exciting collaborations, releases such as the Photek remix of the track ""Mamma Mia"" on the Tekdbz inprint and performance requests coming in... 

&gt; Deadly Hunta has to be the UK reggae artist to keep an eye on throughout 2007 and beyond.

&gt; Throughout 2009 Deadly Hunta could be found touring the clubs and festivals around Europe as well as gigs as far flung as New Zealand. 2010 is looking just as fruitful for this UK home grown talent. He has made an international name for himself and continues to share his skills across the European continent. 

&gt; Deadly Hunta is someone the UK can be proud of.

20th_reddit_acc,,,"maybe you have a shitty ping to US servers aswell and are used to lag without realizing. There are very little other explanations because distance between client and server always increases the ping. 

a common place for gaming servers in europe is frankurt (germany). Ping between frankfurt and New york is around 90ms at best. ping between Frankfurt and Los angelas is around 140ms (again, at best, often people have copper cables instead of fiber on the last couple hundred metres to their homes which makes ping even worse).
  
  There is no magic way to eliminate this. If you live on the US east coast you might not feel a big difference between playing on EU servers than playing on US west coast servers because the great distances give you about the same garbage ping.

Maccullenj,cthulu,Cthulhu,"&gt; C'est extrêmement mal connaitre les dynamiques prépondérantes dans un grand nombre de franges de la population musulmane française

Dans, donc, une minorité qui chérit son quant à soi. Que le PEW estime au plus à 10% de la population à l'horizon 2050. Pour laquelle il est difficile d'évaluer le degré de sécularisation au bout de 3 générations. Bref, un truc peu incident et transitoire.

Une triple politique d'éclatement des ghettos, de revalorisation des CSP- et medians, et de valorisation du mérite, et tu as une chute de l'islamisation, de même qu'il y a eu une chute du catholicisme quand on a offert de vraies opportunités aux immigrés polonais, italiens et portugais de l'entre deux guerres (plus que, disons, mineur de fond). (inb4 *contexte différent, et-puis-on-a-pas-les-thunes* : A l'époque, les vrais riches avaient un impôt allant jusqu'à 90%. On restaure l'ISF, on plafonne les revenus, et shazam, on nage dans le fric à *vraiment* faire ruisseler)

&gt; faute de quoi on fait face à un parangon de régime démocratique.

... Pardon ? Je crois qu'il y a une erreur. Parangon, c'est ultra-positif.

S'ensuit un mur de texte qui dit en substance : des groupes ultra minoritaires ont l'intention de retourner la démocratie contre elle même, dans leur propre intérêt.

C'est pour ça qu'on a inventé un certain nombre de verrous : Assemblée Nationale ET Sénat ET Conseil Constitutionnel. Pour qu'un groupe de pression minoritaire ne puisse pas imposer une législation à la con.

Mais bien avant d'en arriver à cela : votre petite bande d'identitaires apocalyptiques aime à se faire peur, en grossissant l'influence des croques mitaines étrangers. Merkel est une dévoreuse impérialiste (et surement nazi, au fond), l'Europe veut exploiter nos agriculteurs pour financer ces fainéants de grecs, et les mumu veulent coller des voiles à nos filles.

Mais tout ça, et une bonne partie de ton propos, c'est un raisonnement basé sur un postulat faussé : l'idéologie prime sur l'intérêt personnel. Or, comme le démontre l'indéniable tournant libéral mondial depuis plus d'un siècle, c'est faux. Qu'on l'apprécie ou pas, les gens pensent à leur cul en premier. C'est ce qui a mis Macron ET Trump au pouvoir, c'est ce qui explique le brexit et la rentable neutralité de la Suisse, c'est ce qui explique la conversion de l'URSS et de la Chine à une économie libérale plus ou moins assumée. Les idées c'est cool, mais il y a mieux : Tomber de la meuf, conduire des grosses bagnoles rouges et assurer sa retraite (qu'on passera à sauter des chaudasses dans des bagnoles rouges, évidemment).

Tout ça pour dire : tu envisages de bloquer les groupes fachos (genre frères mumu et consorts) par le rapport de force. Ce qui me parait évident, c'est qu'il suffit de saper leur base populaire en lui donnant un confort supérieur à ce qu'une religiosité aveugle peut apporter. Et ça, ça implique une mutation sociétale pour valoriser les classes les plus défavorisées.

Ha, au fait, seconde incohérence :

&gt; Mais dis toi que même cette organisation d'extrême droite bien connu pour son racisme et son islamophobie qu'est la Cour Européenne des Droits de l'Homme (CEDH) a elle-même dans un arrêté de 2001 jugé la charia (promue par les organisations sus-citées) comme incompatible avec la démocratie

Wittyandpithy,,,"Lots!

Your logic will seem accurate at first, but you are not considering velocity of money.  

Think of it this way: a rich person will have a fairly constant discretionary spend per year.  Of course there are expections, but generally rich people don't spend money.

In contrast, poor people are not buying a whole bunch of discretionary spend just because they simply cannot afford it.  E.g. you choose between buying fresh fruit or a bit of meat, or between a mid-range phone and seeing the dentist.  

So when you increase the salary of rich people, the consequence is usually asset inflation (house prices go up, etc).

When you increase poor people's salary, the real economy (consumption) increases, because they are expanding their discretionary spend.

Basically, you enrich your society, and in turn your society gets richer.

However, this is NOT the case if you have weak employment laws, allowing businesses to fire people willy nilly.

So in Australia, we boosted minimum wage and employment went up, businesses increases overall revenue and profit.  

But in some states of the USA I know you have awful employment laws.

The reason why businesses say 'higher wage = job loss' is because what it actually does is reduce shareprice value or bonus potential for business owners and senior management.  So of course they say its bad.  Their logic is extremely short sighted though, because you don't get sustainably rich by beggaring your neighbour.  Unfortunately the US seems to never learn from the wealth of information available from Europe Canada Australia and NZ

Khnagar,,,"That's actually not the prevailing theory anymore. 

A self-inflicted, pre-European contact ecocide on Easter Island works well as a warning to the globe as a whole, but the theory has fallen out of favour the last decade. It's a very compelling parable of todays global environmental problems. But its probably not what happened.

Easter Island had a relatively simple ecosystem with few predators and a lot of palm trees. (I'm oversimplifying things here, I know). When humans came to Easter Island, rats also came along with them at some point. And with plenty of food and no natural predators, their numbers soared. Archeology shows that nearly all palm roots are eaten by rats. Almost every palm seed shell found has been eaten by rats. This kills the palm trees and it prevents new palm trees from growing.

The devastating ecological effects of introduced rats and to a lesser degree the impact of human settlement is what led to a disaster. The people of Easter Island weren't idiots who cut down the last palm tree without a thought or care as to what would happen when all the palm trees were gone.

transcribot,,Bot Transcriber in Training," have a whole team dedicated to similar types of 

situations of identity theft. It sucks to get your personal information out there, but something doesnt add up. Why did you add that part 

with TF2, the name of your community, and how he wants attention...? Seems kind of pointless to add that part unless you wanted to 

garner attention from that community. Shit, I'm going to get a lot of hate from this, but you kind of went from 0 to 100 on what happens 

next, and it seems kind of dramatic.

I'm sorry but this smells a lot like BS to me. What state are you in? Eviction timelines are up to 6 months in some states, and typically 

bnger in the winter. You do not need to be homeless as a result of this.

Have you talked with your landlord about the situation? Will they let you stay month to month until you get this sorted out?

What grants were you getting to buy a house?

I'm guessing that you have a job since you were able to qualify at purchasing a house so I'm inclined to bel'eve you have money still 

coming in. i dont know what area you live in but while I was basically homeless at one time, I found that KOA campgrounds are a 

decent place to live if they have the small cabins. 

I was able to talk one campground into letting me stay in one of their cabins for 30S a night(it didnt have bathroom, had to use the 

campground bathrooms and showers). I dont know what avg hotel prices are in your area, but I do know they will advertise for like 35 a 

night for a cheap one, but once they get done adding on taxes and fees, it will turn into more like 50-55 a night from 35. Get yourself a 

storage building as well to put any extra stuff you have into for the time being. If you cant afford these things, find yourself a truck stop. 

It's saves some embarassment being as those folks basically walk around look'ng homeless(carrying bags everywhere, I know because 

I was one). Lots of truckstops have showers that you pay a few bucks to use and some I've been in even have small movie theaters. It 

you get sick of hanging out in the truckstops or being stuck at KOA, go find a library. It's one of the few other places that you can loiter 

all day and they do tend to have internet. Above all, start looking for places to go NOW if things do not work out. Don't sit around and 

just worry about what will happen up until the point you may or may not be homeless. Be proactive and go scout around at your options. 

Oh yea, GET A po BOX WHILE YOU HAVE A PHYSICAL ADDRESS-NOW! Where I live, it is required to have a physical address to 

sign up for a PO box to get your mail. Without one, you will be screwed. Trust me, you will need to do this. Last of all, I found the 

homeless experience to actually be invigorating. I met some good people at the KOA camps and had some good experiences. The 

homeless experience led me to be more grateful for some things and reaffirmed the motto ""Desperation is inspiration."" Good luck and

seanfish,,,"Good points, just remember that it was the same Crown appointing the local governing structure and approving local methods. Maori had social structures like trade and diplomacy that were more recognisable- for a start they weren't the first Polynesian culture encountered by a long shot. Also remember while running off a cliff might not have happened, plenty of lives were lost all the same. 

I think another big factor was the use of Australia as a prison colony - so Maori were second class citizens whereas aboriginal Australians needed to fit under prisoners and were determined to be pretty much equivalent to animals as a result.

I think at the end of the day we should celebrate where we are - we're pretty much the best model short of actual self-governance of power sharing in the colonised world. We're genuinely bilingual and genuinely representative at a governmental level. Huge work has been done in terms of reparations thanks in fairly large part to the tribunal and Jim Bolger's fiscal envelope.

The tribunal started in 1975 and could only address current issues under Treaty terms at the start. It wasn't until 1985 that grievances going back to the Treaty - all the stuff that actually went wrong - could be legally addressed.

It's really Maori activists that got that going. Do the degree that European New Zealanders were better, it's because they were middle class rather than deported criminal underclass. It was the same Crown at the top. If they'd have decided mass slaughter to be more expedient, they'd have done it. Maori were shit hot at warfare from fortified positions, so it wasn't more expedient.",True,0,1520143657,,False,0,dv5m4p0,False,t3_81smrm,True,t1_dv5ko4n,/r/newzealand/comments/81smrm/problems_in_current_maori_culture_from_haka/dv5m4p0/,1524793202,3,True,False,newzealand,t5_2qhma,public,

Children to immigrants who were either born here or immigrated before the age of five or so, almost never have an identifying accent.

In the US, you should use European immigrants as an example, not east Asians or Hispanics, since the latter 2 groups are usually immersed in their original culture and language even generations after immigrating.
