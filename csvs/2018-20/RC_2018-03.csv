The grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) is the species of fish with the largest reported production in aquaculture globally, over five million tonnes per year. It is a large herbivorous freshwater fish species of the family Cyprinidae native to eastern Asia, with a native range from northern Vietnam to the Amur River on the Siberia-China border. This Asian carp is the only species of the genus Ctenopharyngodon.

It is cultivated in China for food, but was introduced in Europe and the United States for aquatic weed control.

king-krool,,,"“Conclusions


The empirical evidence of an association between low-density settlement patterns and a high reliance on automobiles on the one hand and between high-density environments and more transit use on the other is firmly established. This chapter is more interested in the dynamics, especially in a policy context, than in the static relationship. Similarities and contrasts between the United States and Western Europe provide a backdrop to this discussion. Many in the planning profession in the United States believe that densification strategies can induce more transit use or, alternatively, investing in more transit will result in higher densities. They look to Europe as a model for this strategy, even though the policy environments are very different (Nivola, 1999). Unfortunately, the facts are against them. Certainly, transit shares are higher in Europe, especially in or close to core cities where densities are higher. But the trends indicate convergence between the United States and Western Europe, with the automobile share rising in the latter despite higher densities and very strong pro-transit policies. Also, all the efforts to promote more transit in the United States have, according to the 2001 NHTS survey, resulted in a declining transit share. The reasons are clear. While you can introduce higher densities in micro-environments, especially if you implement draconian changes in zoning ordinances, making region-wide density changes is like trying to turn an aircraft carrier around. Alternatively, as the Atlanta-Barcelona example illustrates, the investments in public transit required to generate European levels of transit shares are impossibly infeasible. Of course, you make changes at the margin. But the overall assessment is unequivocal. Whatever problems, real or imagined, might be associated with sprawl in the United States, the transit-high density remedy is bound to fail. An intelligent reading of the European experience makes this obvious, despite contrary conclusions drawn by the less well informed. Almost all US cities are caught in a low-density trap from which there is no escape via pipedreams, fantasies or even forceful policies.”",True,0,1519863439,,False,0,duzn9vi,False,t3_80xnov,True,t1_duzf5la,/r/bayarea/comments/80xnov/youre_not_a_progressive_if_youre_also_a_nimby_why/duzn9vi/,1524684400,6,True,False,bayarea,t5_2qjyy,public,

3-Porque a Receita Federal é tão contrária à diminuição da carga tributária no Brasil se já passamos da curva de Laffer direto pro guardrail do dito cujo?

4-Se eu compro uma placa de vídeo do exterior e pago o imposto corretamente, e se posteriormente preciso fazer remessa da mesma placa para o exterior para fins de conserto ou troca por defeito (via RMA), como faço para comprovar que já paguei a tributação daquele produto quando ele retornar ao Brasil se o papel da tributação não parece ter nenhum dado que identifique seu conteúdo, apenas a descrição genérica do tipo do item declarado? Preciso fazer uma declaração específica antes de fazer a remessa? Se sim, como comprovar, aqui mesmo, que já paguei o tributo antes do envio?

5-Pode falar sobre a tributação de bitcoins? Se eu começar a ""minerar"", já devo declarar o valor, ou só quando isso for convertido em moeda corrente? E quem minerava já desde que bitcoin foi criado, como fica a declaração de bens dessa pessoa a partir do momento em que se tornou necessário declarar bitcoin Aliás, qual a natureza jurídica do bitcoin para a Receita Federal?

6-A informatização da tributação de remessas vindas do exterior já terminou?

7-Se eu não me cadastrar nesse serviço dos Correios (em parceria com a receita) de ambiente virtual para pagamento de tributos de remessas do exterior, corro o risco de não receber a remessa?

8-Como é o controle em cima dos funcionários que fazem a separação dos produtos importados para tributação para evitar furtos?

9-Quando uma remessa é aberta para verificação do conteúdo, se o funcionário constata a ausência de algo que deveria estar ali pela natureza do produto (exemplo: nota fiscal cita console + jogo, mas não tem o jogo dentro), vocês criam uma ocorrência interna para que conste que, após a abertura, havia discrepância entre a declaração ou nota fiscal e o conteúdo do pacote?

Yes and no. There is coverage where there are people interested in providing it. Europe is hardly a barren wasteland of random hours. You go to Europe afternoon to evening even on week days and you get a lot of coverage. Weekends is pretty good.

wasd9876,,,"As an Irish person who stumbled on this thread I can tell you what the thoughts are here.

There is more chance of you getting sunburnt in Leicster Square tomorrow night than of the Irish ""blinking first"".

The reasons for this are pretty simple and straightforward:

1. The phase 1 agreement isn't just being put in writing, its going to be a legal agreement that is independent of anything that may or may not happen with the phase 2 negotiations.

2. David Davis and his big mouth have ensured that the legal text will be drawn up in even more detail than previous to ensure that the Tories have no wiggle room on the agreement.

3. The legal text will say (having been agreed in December) that if nothing better is agreed in phase 2 (such as a UK-EU customs union) then the worst scenario will be that Northern Ireland remains in the single market and the customs union. The Irish and the EU have exactly what they want already on the Northern Ireland border. There's no reason to blink and a no deal in phase 2 still means no border in the North.

4. The Irish economy does stand to take a hit if theres no phase 2 agreement, but nowhere near the extent of the UK. The Irish will lose out on UK beef sales for example, but there'll also be a gap in the market from British beef exports that we can fill, and I can almost guarantee that the EU will make funds available for Ireland to deal with the transition that will leave us in a very, very strong position to capitalise on those gaps.

5. Theres a reason that the UK have conceded on almost every demand the EU has made in negotiations, its because the UK has no leverage. No deal will decimate the UK economy, hurt the Irish and be an inconvenience to the EU. Everyone in power knows this. All the Tories are doing are biding their time to make things palatable for the Leavers and for the Tories so the government doesn't fall.

If anyones expecting the negotiations to suddenly do a 180 and for the Tories to suddenly start taking control and getting what they want (or the ridiculous idea of leaving with no deal) then they're not paying attention to all the underlying facts and ignoring how phase 1 played out.",True,0,1519873163,,False,0,duzw70w,False,t3_80kr82,True,t3_80kr82,/r/ukpolitics/comments/80kr82/will_ireland_blink_first_when_it_comes_to_the_ni/duzw70w/,1524689006,1,True,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,public,

(2009) Way &amp; Lieberman analyze genetic contribution to cultural differences in this piece and draw support for dual-inheritance theory.

They show that there are genetic predispositions for IQ, collectivism, individualism, a wide breadth of aspects of socialization, depression, and other psychocultural phenomena which determine the values of societies and their people. They show that populations have mean genetics which means they have mean dispositions and thus mean personalities as well and thus cultures are formed around those same means.

These findings are supported by (Simoons, F, 1969; Simoons, F, 1970; Cavalli-Sforza, Menozzi &amp; Piazza, 1994; Holden &amp; Mace, 1997; Durham, 1991; Perry et al., 2007; Campbell, 1965; McElreath &amp; Henrich, 2007; Kroeberm &amp; Kluckhohn, 1952; Sasaki, 2013; Cochran &amp; Harpending, 2009; Bentley, Hahn &amp; Shennan, 2004; Boyd &amp; Richerson, 1985; Gabora, 1995; and so many more)

(2006) Templer &amp; Arikawa analyze populations by temperature, skin color, per capita income, and IQ and find stark correlations between all of them.

They were able to accurately predict individual IQ by skin color (0,92), mean high Winter temperature of their race (0,76), mean low Winter temperature of their race (0,66), and per capita income (0,63). These findings provide strong support for the idea that colder climates caused selection for higher IQs over an evolutionary epoch.

(2005) Mekel-Bobrov et al., conclude that the gene ASPM is a specific regulator of brain size, and its evolution in the lineage leading to Homo sapiens was driven by strong positive selection. They show that one genetic variant of ASPM in humans arose merely about 5.800 years ago in Eurasia and has since swept to high frequency across Eurasia under strong positivel selection.

The gene is almost non-existent in Sub-Saharan Africa.

https://www.ucl.ac.uk/tcga/tcgapdf/Thomas-99-intelligence.pdf

(1998) Thomas, Miller &amp; Mascie-Taylor conclude that the EST00083 (""expressed sequence tag"") is an mtDNA (mitochondrial; maternal) polymorphism found more often in high IQ groups. It is particularly common in Europe (less so in Asia) where it is associated with a lineage that dates back 35.000 years. It is nearly non-existent in Africa.

This finding goes along with a discovery by Turner &amp; Partington in 1991 that shows mothers are the primary component in a child's intelligence.

https://www.jstor.org/stable/2999198?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents

(1998) The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education concludes that at all family income levels, there is a persisting racial gap in SAT scores and that the poorest White children outperform the richest Black children. This further suggests that environment is not the explanation for intelligence or the racial testing gap.

These findings are supported by (Binkley &amp; Collin, 2013; North Carolina SAT Report, 2010; Dixon-Roman &amp; Ezekiel et al., 2013; La Griffe du Lion Volume II Number III, 2000; Wightman, 1994; Murray &amp; Herrnstein, 1996; Scarr &amp; Weinberg, 1983; Scarr &amp; Weinberg, 1976; Ciotti, 1998; Arthur Jensen, 1998; Keyes et al., 2009; Miller et al., 2012; Hicks et al., 2004; Iacono et al., 1999; Hur &amp; Bouchard, 1995; Alford, Funk &amp; Hibbing, 2005; Block &amp; Block, 2005; Bouchard et al., 2012; Lykken et al., 1993)

(2002) Davide Piffer concludes that the genes rs9320913 (A), rs3783006 (C), rs8049439 (T), rs13188378 (G), rs11584700 (G), rs4851266 (T), rs2054125 (T), rs3227 (C), rs4073894 (A) and rs12640626 are genes associated with intelligence and brain-size.

rs236330 is a gene strongly expressed in neurons, including hippocampal neurons and developing brains, where it regulates neuronal morphology.

rs324650 is a gene involved in neuronal excitability, synaptic plasticity and feedback regulation of acetylcholine release.

East Asian populations (Japanese, Koreans, Bei-Chinese) have the highest average frequency of these alleles (39%) with the slimmest curve of distributions. Europeans have the second-highest amount of these alleles (35,5%) with a right-leaning and wide curve. Sub-Saharan Africans have the lowest frequencies of these alleles (16,4%) with a remarkably slim curve of distributions.

He states that these are not the only genes associated with intelligence but they are some of the known genes for intelligence and brain-size determination. They vary in prevalence across different populations and are evidence of recent polygenic selection.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18292342

(2008) Li JZ et. al., show the distinct population groups of the Earth by genetically testing individuals from each population group and mapping them by their single nucleotide polymorphisms.

Only three groups - South Asians, Central (West) Asians, and East Asians have overlaps while Middle Easterners, Central Asians, and Indian South Asians have genetic contributions from European population groups. There is no genetic continuum between Africans and any other population group alive. The 40.000 years of evolution put between the rest of Mankind and Africans can be shown as the source of this.

This finding is supported by (Lao et. al., 2006; Costas et. al., 2005; Xing et. al., 2010 (1); Xing et. al., 2010 (2); Jakobsson et. al., 2008; Huang et. al., 2011; Paşaniuc et. al., 2010; Huang et. al., 2009; Hao et. al., 2009; Nothnagel et. al., 2009; Chanda et. al., 2012)

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1893020/

(2007) Witherspoon et. al., conclude that Lewontin's Fallacy that individuals within populations are more genetically unique than between populations is false when more than one genetic variable is used.

They show that Lewontin's Fallacy is based upon cherry-picked selection of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms common to all humans and upon selecting for as few as two single nucleotide polymorphisms the differences become readily apparent and classable. Genetic stratification as a result of this is inevitable without cherry-picking.

WikiTextBot,,,"**Galah**

The galah  (Eolophus roseicapilla), also known as the rose-breasted cockatoo, galah cockatoo, roseate cockatoo or pink and grey, is one of the most common and widespread cockatoos, and it can be found in open country in almost all parts of mainland Australia.

It is endemic on the mainland and was introduced to Tasmania, where its distinctive pink and grey plumage and its bold and loud behaviour make it a familiar sight in the bush and increasingly in urban areas. It appears to have benefited from the change in the landscape since European colonisation and may be replacing the Major Mitchell's cockatoo in parts of its range.

The term galah is derived from gilaa, a word found in Yuwaalaraay and neighbouring Aboriginal languages.

The same Prophet who explained first that cyclical theory was the core lie used to cover-up the fundamental Law governing the second age, mathematically maximally reduced returns an exponential curve.  
The same Prophet who predicted and explained that imminent end of age was the reason to launch military Armageddon, with the ultimatum to Serbia, the 13 October 1998 deadline.

World War III: original script released 1943 was a remake of original WW2 script, two of the ultimate reductions of illuminati end times.  
The first reduction is implicitly stated: again the same original script.  
The second reduction is what the original script was: a fake war with real blood.  
The ultimate reason for all this: proving the illuminati anti-bible true, in particular that ""Armageddon is a lie"".  
At the end of the day not only WW2  but also World War III started as a real war mixed with fake wars.  
As expected from the Laws of End Times Reductionism some of these fake wars were additionally reduced to fake blood.

2 Thessalonians 2:3-4
Psalm 95:5
1 Chronicles 16:26
1 Corinthians 10:20

The people who do not worship the god of Christianity are not worshiping god, but devils. 

&gt; Pope Pius XI, Mortalium Animos (#10) 6 Jan 1928: “This Apostolic Sea has never allowed itself to take part in the assemblies of non-Catholics.”

The whore of Babylon is the false bride, which is the entire Vatican II council.  Reference Our lady of La Salette.

&gt; Our Lady of La Salette 19 Sept 1846: “Rome will lose the faith and become the seat of the Antichrist. The church will be in eclipse.”

By spiritual fornication, the entire Vatican II council leads people away from the true Catholic Church and towards apostasy. Europe will only leave the true Catholic Church to only being small fragments of believers, while Christian Europe becomes pagan again.

This is a nice column for various reasons, but I am sure this thread will appreciate it as an exposition of the ""intra-social trust makes societies work; ethnic homogeneity makes intra-social trust"" line of reasoning that doesn't overhype it to the point of absurdity. I'm wondering how it will be received -- paradigm shift or giant shitstorm, or both?

One issue she seems to ignore, though it almost screams out from her writing, is the issue of size -- what if a small country like Denmark can enjoy more trust in institutions and in each other than a half-continent like the USA because *societies just don't scale*, and people naturally distrust a government a thousand miles away more than they would a government made of their townsfolk? Once again, this is not an all-explainer -- but it should be helpful in making sense at least of the differences in *trust in institutions*. Americans have been deploring the Feds for ages; most Europeans have been reasonably content with their governments at least until the migration crisis. But ask how much they like the EU, and suddenly a different tenor emerges.",True,0,1519878629,,False,0,dv010ur,False,t3_80d7m8,False,t3_80d7m8,/r/slatestarcodex/comments/80d7m8/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_february_26/dv010ur/,1524691517,46,True,False,slatestarcodex,t5_30m6u,public,

lacraquotte,,,"Usual extreme exaggeration when it comes to China. First of all household debt is very mild here (I live in China) compared to other countries, in fact it [is among the lowest in the world](https://www.statista.com/statistics/738695/household-debt-gdp-globally-by-country/). China has more of a problem with State Owned Entreprises debt but that's a totally different issue.

Secondly, the user said it best: buying a property here is extremely restricted. In Shanghai where I live for instance you need to put crazy down-payments in order to buy a flat (north of 50%), you need to have a hukou here (chinese province residency system), etc. In other words it's nothing like the real estate bubble in the US where everyone and their mother was given enormous amounts of debt: the requirements to get debt here are among the most drastic in the world, by far! Only extremely solvent people get debt so the likelihood that a big proportion of those loans would default is close to null. 

Lastly he claims Chinese properties have no intrinsic value because it's just speculation: those properties aren't even occupied. Well bad news for him: ghost cities, ghost apartment complexes, etc. are pretty much a legend. Vacancy rates in China are around 13% on average  for housing ([Harvard study on this](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/weihuang/files/chinaboom_final.pdf)) which, while relatively high, is really far from critical. If you want a US comparison, Alabama is currently at 15%, North Dakota at 17% and Hawai at 10% ([according to the US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/data/rates.html)). Ghost cities are by and large a fabrication by Western media. I just googled ""China ghost cities"" and stumbled upon [this extraordinary Guardian article on ""European-style ghost towns around Shanghai""](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/gallery/2015/jul/23/shanghai-china-european-style-ghost-towns-in-pictures): it just so happens that I've personally visited each and every single city mentioned in there (in fact I was in Thames Town 2 months ago with my daughter) and none of them are ghost cities, they're all bursting with activity. It's fake news, pure and simple, the blatant fakery just blows my mind... Have I visited each and every single town that western media claim are ghost cities?

neoshero,flag landskap-smaland,Småland,"&gt;I flera år har det så kallade utstationeringsdirektivet varit en hjärtefråga för den svenska regeringen. Direktivet reglerar vad som gäller för arbetare som är anställda i ett EU-land, men som tillfälligt jobbar i ett annat EU-land, till exempel lastbilschaufförer och byggnadsarbetare.  
Enligt det nya direktivet ska lika lön och ersättningar, som traktamenten till exempel, gälla både svensk och utländsk arbetskraft. Det nya direktivet har varit en stridsfråga i EU där flera länder i öst motsatt sig det.  

Verkar som att det kommer bli svårare att importera billig arbetskraft i syfte för att lönedumpa  numera, om man nu måste ge dem lika lön. Frågan är vad detta kommer påverka ekonomimässigt. Min första tanke är att det blir ännu dyrare att bygga där lönedumpning sker i stor skala.

TheIdSay,,,"i wanna preface this message by saying that i'm a male pretty deep on the spectrum that found this subreddit while searching for the aspergers discord.

firstly, i don't think aspergers is gonna come in the way of you finding someone that likes you more than, say, an interest in video games or an energetic attitude is. it's a part of you. it's not a disease nor a hindrance (although it may feel like it in our currently very nt-taylored society). eventually you will find someone that not only ""gets"" you or ""can live with you"", but rather, loves every part of you, for who you are everything included.

most likely though they will have to either be slightly on the spectrum(whether they know or not) or at least have worked with people on the spectrum. thing is though, it's always gonna be hard communicating/being compatible with nt's. some people are able to, and god bless them.

but in my personal experience, despite me not really being interested in relationships (seems like too much of a bother and life adjustment), i find that any sort of relation with nt's to be... tricky

often times the fact that i'm open, honest and straight forward to even strangers makes people think i'm trying to gain something from them. or that i'm just talking to them to hit on them (has happened more times than i wanna think about), or that if i critique them it means i'm trying to hurt them(a tendency i've found with nt's is that they tend to think being honestly critiquing is some sort of personal attack. even less acceptable if not really close friends, even if they straight up ask for critique it tends to mean ""say nice things about this"". fucking inbetween the lines stuff. if there was meant to be anything inbetween the lines, why not just make another line and say it straight out).

not sure if this is a cultural thing(i am from europe, many i talk to are americans, country of the sexually repressed) or autism thing, but another thing that i can relate to, is the fact that i'm very open and relaxed about sexual stuff. however in my case, no matter how much i think i'm toning it down for the sake of peoples comfort levels, the slightest crack that shows i don't think like them, and i'm considered a pervert to some, while others thinks it's awesome. what's bad to some is great to others.

my point is, every part of you is great the way it is :) someone you can be ""yourself"" around without having to try and communicate in their manner. and eventually you'll find someone who loves all of you. be proud of those strengths :) don't let anyone tell you how you're supposed to be \^.^ and hey, the ""there's only one for everyone"" is kinda a myth, so chances are, even with a bunch of heart breaks, you'll find someone for you one day :) even if it takes like 10 years more",True,0,1519885017,,False,0,dv05huv,False,t3_8003s6,True,t3_8003s6,/r/aspergirls/comments/8003s6/mutual_breakup_but_still_sad/dv05huv/,1524693912,1,True,False,aspergirls,t5_31zba,public,
TenSevenTN,,,"When the founders wrote the second amendment you could own a cannon and a naval frigate, so until you write that message on parchment and have it delivered to my house by a guy on a horse, that argument is invalid.  The second amendment was written by a group of men who were fighting a bloody war to get free of a tyrannical government.  The second amendment is the last fail safe to assure that the people maintain control.  “The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants”. This was the mentality at the time, and still is. Do you think if Donald Trump could crown himself supreme god emperor he would?  I do. 

But putting all that aside, I am a police detective. I see the horrible things people do to each other every day. In a rural jurisdiction where police response time can be 45 minutes to an hour, I have personally seen guns used to save more lives than they take, and prevent countless violent crimes.  There are 300 million guns in this country. The bad guys have them.  They will continue to have them. Your argument is that the best way to protect the elk from the lion is to remove the elk’s antlers.  If someone is trying to force entry into your home to do you harm, you can defend yourself or you can wait to die.  There are background checks and systems in place, but a system is only as good as the data going into it. The Las Vegas shooter would have passed any background check. The most recent shooter would have been prevented from buying a gun if not for the gross negligence of the local Sheriffs Office not properly following up on numerous complaints. 

We just have different philosophies on how to deal with this. I’m firm in my position as I’m sure you are.  But please don’t condescend me like I am some uneducated yokel, because I guarantee that I understand violent men better than you do.  The United States isn’t Europe. The guns are here and aren’t going anywhere. Culturally and Demographically we are very different. We have a horrible problem with violent gangs and drugs, which account for the vast majority of our homicides.  I’m a firm believer that every person has a right to defend themselves. I am also a firm believer that they have access to the tools needed to do so.

TezakKaoKonj,,,"This should be on top. It's an unpopular opinion, because we rightly feel that joining NATO would be an awful thing to do, but from a pragmatic standpoint it's the only option. 

Being a member of NATO provides more options in case of any dispute with another NATO member... and unfortunately, Serbia has a number of such disputes, both active and potential. Being an outsider seriously limits our options, and ensures we'll get screwed again.

Another factor is Russia. Sure, we love our brothers and all, but Russia's geopolitical interest is to destabilize Serbia and keep it as a wedge in the Balkans, to be used against EU/NATO as occasion requires. Sure, they'll show token support (as they've done in the past), and tell us what we like to hear, but will not meaningfully defend or protect our interests. I don't see being in between Russia and EU as being in Serbia's interest either -- times have changed, and unlike Yugoslavia, we're not big enough (or clever enough) to play them off against each other. 

Now, I personally dislike NATO as much as the next person (they did bomb us, and take some of our territory, after all). Moreover, joining NATO feels a bit like paying off or joining the mafia so they'd protect you from themselves. However, other options are bleak.

In what way does the government manage all our resources? Especially the federal government.

&gt;The government controls medicine

Only new medicines, like medical research. If it came down to armed conflict, the valuable medicines would be antibiotics and stimulants. Which I think non-governmental forces would have plenty of access to both.

&gt;the money supply

In an armed conflict, it won't be the dollar that would be the most valuable. It will be ammunition and shit. So sure, the fed can fuck with interest rates. But that's not what a militia will give a shit about at the time.

This one you have a point, to a degree. Depending on who's on what side. Rebel forces would probably lose GPS to some degree.

ianandris,,,"I agree with some of what you said, disagree with a few other points, but I think it's worth pointing out that we're both speaking from very different perspectives.

where we agree: 
1. law abiding citizens don't perpetuate mass murder. 

2. there is something dark happening with *some people* in the US that isn't happening elsewhere and it isn't strictly gun culture, though gun culture is a facet of eproblem. 

3. outright banning things has a tendency to make problems worse by ceding regulation and distribution of goods to the black market. This results in an increase of criminal behavior in general. 

4. There is a strong mental health component that remains unaddressed. 

Where we disagree: 

1. The law is not meaningless in preventing the use of some kind of weaponry by malicious actors. There is a reason fully auto weapons were not used in those incidents, and that reason is they are hard to obtain. The Vegas shooter, for instance, was using bump stocks for that reason. I have no doubt if he could have obtained a fully auto weapon, he would have used it on those concert goers. From a policy perspective, it's worth examining what legislation made those weapons hard to obtain and how that legislation which had already proven effective can be leveraged to limit there use of other destructive weaponry. This part isn't about addressing the reasons, is about minimizing risk. Not the whole solution, but definitely a part of the solution. 

2. The solutions you suggested are in almost every case more difficult to implement stateside than reregulating the availability of assault weapons. Counseling costs money and in a state where healthcare is considered the responsibility of the individual and is often prohibitively expensive, how would we ensure people who need help get help? Half the country is perfectly okay with letting kids suffer because of their parents choices and even half measures like Obamacare were/still are being fought tooth and nail. There is no consensus that everyone should even *have* access to healthcare. This requires at least as significant a shift in political will as better gun regulation. That said, I agree that addressing the health aspect is likely the single most important thing we can do. Unfortunately, this won't become politically viable until after Democrats control government. 

Police reactivity is honestly not the issue here. Most of these mass murderers are not the demographic being subjected to violence from the pd. These are largely white kids/men from typically affluent suburban areas. The Orlando shooter, an ISIS affiliate, was actually an outlier for the US and, frankly, at this point its looking like Europe has a bigger Islamic terrorism problem than the US. 9/11 was almost 20 years ago. 

Limiting media fame could make a difference, sure, and steps are being taken by many news agencies to do just that, but legislating how media report on incidents is a 1st amendment (free speech) issue that is unequivocally an even bigger political problem than better gun regulation. There is *no* public will, no stomach, no desire to begin regulating speech like that. It's about the only place where conservatives and liberals can agree (though conservatives would have you think that liberals want to abolish it altogether. This is a blatant lie.). All that said, everyone knows who Anders Brevik is, you know? Treating these guys like Voldemort isn't really addressing anything of substance because it assumes the motive for these killers is simply fame. I don't know if that's true. It may be in some cases, but it's really just guessing at motives and painting with a broad stroke. 

I actually think this is the rotten thing: the ""rugged individualism"" some have taken to be a core American value justifies indifference at best if not outright contempt for the common good. This allows all sorts of sickness to take root in the mind of a society. It is permissive of greed, abuse of position for personal gain, and death and destruction of others because they don't deserve to live if they can't make it on their own. This results in a situation where a lot of young white men grow up feeling powerless and subject to extreme pressures to succeed. 

They see circumstances visibly stacked against them. Since they are isolated from real, diverse community, they often feel like noone is fighting for them, they feel forgotten. They lash out at ""social justice warriors"" because they see them advocating almost entirely for the causes of girls, women, and minorities, groups they will never be a part of, and they end up feeling forgotten, powerless, worthless until proven otherwise. It's a truly toxic combination rooted in the aforementioned individualism and exacerbated by social isolation. Most young men move past that feeling by developing social networks (this is where community helps a lot), but some broken folks simply become resentful and hateful of everyone and everything. Some of them self segregate into communities of like minded resentful people and thats where you get the increasing levels of indiscriminate violence.

Oh, and you know when politicized messages about individualsm became more prevelant?

I apologize for a **very** long post incoming but it sounds like you're interested in the subject, so maybe something I'll say here might be informative.

There is some documentation and historical fencing manuals that will talk about dueling opponents in ""full harness"" (fully armored) but most of what we have that survives is related to civilian dueling contexts where it was assumed that you wouldn't have much armor, maybe just the thicker quilted clothing common to a lot of northern/western Europe (which is actually not bad if the opponent's biomechanics are generally bad or if he whiffs a strike). 

However, from historical accounts that we've aggregated, in general when you came across armored opponents on a battlefield, if for whatever unlikely reason you were in a 1v1, and all you had was a bladed weapon like a longsword or something poke-y but won't pierce armor strongly like a spear, you'd probably have to grapple the dude onto the ground and either cut up his harness (straps if it was cheaper gear and they were exposed), stab him in the visor (effective, with caveats), or stab him in other spots where armor just can't be placed like the palms, the groin, armpits, back of the knees, etc.

That's a very sweeping generalization and circumstances and context matters *a* *lot*. For example, you may not want to kill the guy even if it's entirely within your ability to do so. Ransoms for knights and other nobles got you a pretty decent sum and you usually wouldn't get nearly as much stigma as you would for murdering the dude (especially if he surrendered). 

Another thing to consider is that grappling is not ideal combat-wise because while weapons are almost like levers and don't require much more than a minimum of physical strength to use and they rely more on biomechanics and skill, grappling is much more influenced by physical strength differences, at least to a greater degree than combat with weapons. Theoretically if he was losing in a long/mid-range fight with polearms or swords but you went to grapple him and he's bigger than you *and* not much less competent in grappling, he could turn the tables on you!

It's also not great because there's a good chance that while you're holding a dude down and trying to figure out a way to disable him, a friend of his will knock you over the back of the head while you're distracted. 

Full scale battles also varied greatly by culture, time period, circumstances, terrain, and so on, and were actually much rarer compared to sieges and raiding (because of how risky and game-changing field battles could be), but in *general*, in European warfare from the high Middle Ages to the late middle ages until about the Hussite Wars (maybe Crecy and other Hundred Years' War battles), there was an effective convention. Basically the idea was that your archers might soften up the enemy in the initial stages of the battle, make them feel pressured and harass more lightly armored soldiers and horses. 

Contrary to popular culture, arrows were *not* effective against full armor, not even mail armor. (Bit of a tangent, but arrows that were effective against mail armor like bodkins were actually very bad against quilted/padded armor worn underneath mail armor, and vice versa for arrows effective against under armor). Even crazy high poundage bows made famous by the Welsh and English longbowman or those nutty windlass crossbows can't pierce breastplates. What they *can* do is soften up the enemy and injure horses, or otherwise affect morale. 

After the initial skirmishing stages are over, then your infantry with polearms would move in to maneuver and engage. Contrary to popular culture (again), swords - while versatile, were not effective in the slightest in this stage of the battle. No one would carry it as a primary weapon at this *point* but we'll come back to that. The infantry would maneuver to a point that they would try to open up a gap or expose a flank, or separate enemy lines if they could (again, all very dependent on how the battle goes, coordination, tactics, leadership, and so, so many factors), so that the heavy cavalry could charge into the 'breach'. 

While horses and knights both are not stupid enough to ride blindly into pikes, when there's an opening and they can exploit it - chaos usually ensues for the side being charged. Pikes and other polearm formations are effective when coordinated, well-led, and skillful, but they're also very bad at battlefield mobility and staying coordinated if the tide starts to turn. Examples would be the death/capture of a leader, significant losses, or something that just makes you naturally shit your trousers like seeing hundreds of heavily armored knights atop massive destrier warhorses or crazy fast coursers charging at your line's weak spot.

Once the enemy starts to break formation, that's actually where the *most* casualties and injuries will happen. If it's total chaos on one side (a rout), then in breaking if individual opponents stay behind to fight, they essentially get overwhelmed and ganked (sound familiar?). If they run, either the heavy cavalry or much more likely, the light cavalry that was skirmishing, scouting, or harassing in the initial stages of the battle will ride the runners and stragglers down, assuming they don't surrender entirely. (This is also where swords are much more useful, due to their versatility and the lack of pitched battle). While it seems cruel and merciless, unfortunately it was during that stage of the battle that an army could find the only opportunity to inflict lasting and meaningful damage on enemy armies, and in those times it took months or even years to replenish levies and train knights, etc. Especially if they were specialty troops like the veteran English longbowmen - after those famous archers were slaughtered at the Battle of Patay (which was to France what Agincourt and Crecy were to England), there was a good chance that their numbers might never be replenished.

If the breaking is better coordinated or rallied, or the victors are too worn down or tired to pursue, then it's only a retreat and the losing army will have some losses but the consequences aren't utterly catastrophic. 

That's kind of the meta, if you will, of a lot of continental European warfare. Again, it's really hard to generalize like this, but it's the best I can do. If you want to find more reading, especially more contextual and specific reading, finding reputable modern scholars who have actually looked at primary sources and consulted archaeological evidence is of **prime** importance. If the author isn't backing up claims with as many primary sources as can be found, has a transparent agenda, isn't respected in the historical community, etc. etc. then he or she isn't worth wasting the time to read.

Jora_,,voted to leave SM + CU and negotiate a UK-EU FTA,"&gt;Notice the completel lack of remain campaigners telling us how wonderful it would be once brussels was ruling us fully and we were part of a federation.

Not just during the campaign, but ever since. Pretty much the only counterargument that seems to be made against brexit (in the press, and on this sub) is an economic one. 

I'm not even suggesting that that isn't a fair line of attack (and frankly I voted leave fully aware that there would likely be an economic hit). However, I've not seen any answer from Remain-supporters that deal with the issues that actually resulted in the Leave vote.

It's especially important if a second referendum does come about. If Leave voters mainly are looking for immigration control, ""sovereignty"" (no ECJ jurisdiction, the UK not being swallowed up into a federal U.S.E.) and the ability to trade more openly with the rest of the world, the Remain side are going to have to come up with an angle to convince those voters that these issues are either not important (tricky), or can be dealt with as a member of the EU (very tricky).

This is why I'm convinced that a second referendum would result in another narrow Leave vote. You aren't going to convince people to swap sides by focusing on economic damage which many Leave voters *expected*. You have to directly address the issues that *did* cause the Leave vote.

Abuser_Name,tr,Turkey,"Some additional points:

1) Any analysis about current Turkish mindset is not complete without identifying the process in which Ottoman Empire (OE) had collapsed. Ottomans were highly pragmatic and knowledgeable in lots of areas, except, in my opinion, public finance. They observed and studied French Revolution and its consequences as well as colonialization and other stuff closely. They tried to build a colony like establishments in Indonesia (look at the flags of Indonesia, Malaysia,  etc and also other North African states who were taken by other Imperial Powers by force from Ottomans before any local independence movements had developed). First railroad in Ottoman Empire was built in 1856-1866. First urban subway (1875), first constitution (1876) in which muslim and non muslim ethnicities got promising rights. Ottomans were in a very pro western route voluntarily which was indeed promoted by Britain and France. So, what happened? Actually Russia happened. In 1877 Russia defeated Ottomans with the help of the local Slavic communities who were being given rights. This war also make British and French to change their minds from promoting Ottomans as a pro western power resisting Russia to take whatever slice for themselves. Reason: Ottoman Empire was weak, not worth to be promoted, hence ""the ill man of the Europe"". After that point Ottomans saw that whatever they do, nearly every identity under their reign turned against them. A tragic thing that, while these things were happening, Ottomans lacked any sort of identity in modern sense. A nation had to be founded immediately but in actuality there were none. First written document about referring to any kind of Turkish nationalism dates only 1908 which discusses three alternatives. i) to be ""Ottoman"", ii) to be ""Muslim"" or iii) to be Turkish. The same author wrote also ""The Essentials of Turkish Nationalism."" And this part is I think to be interesting for any contemporary reader: the author of those was an ethnic Kurd. During those years of founding Turkish nationalism, the first Turkish novel was written by an ethnic Albanian who also wrote the first play in Turkish language, whose brothers are the leaders of Albanian independence movement and arrested while fighting against Ottomans, and that play mentioned was staged by an Armenian and so on. In my opinion, Turkish identity and nationalism is designed and fabricated by the cosmopolitan elite of the dying Ottoman Empire. Those elit was struggling to find a means to survive under the same flag without accepting any other imperial or national identity that they do not define themselves with.

2) During these attempts of modernization of the Ottoman Empire, a need of centralization of power emerged. These efforts of centralization cause resistance among long time allies of Ottomans, like Bosnians and yes Kurds. Both of these ethnicities were very loyal to Ottomans when they were autonomous but turned hostile against centralization  efforts. These resistance movements are silenced by force. Rebellions were somewhat routine businesses for any empire, and those were regarded just another rebellion. Actually ethnic Turks may have a longer track of rebellions against Ottomans than these two ethnicities, I am not an expert on that subject.

3) After WWI, Ottoman Empire collapsed officially and  beyond no hope. The project of a nation building started by the Ottoman elite finished by Atatürk by founding the new Turkish Republic. Atatürk was a genius and an extreme pragmatist. Mainly there were two ethnicities left loyal somehow. Turkish and Kurds. Turks by elimination of others and left nowhere to go, Kurds by the threat of Shiite Iran and Armenians backed by Russians officially pronouncing ethic cleansing against muslims like the ones successfully done in several regions in the Balkans recently, and both the threat of foreign ""infidel"" rulers. Atatürk probably made a promise about autonomy to Kurds until the new state is founded. Like the other promises given to Soviet Russia (to promote communist movement in Anatolia) and to muslims in India (to defend the caliphate against infidel imperials), he did not fulfill the promise of giving autonomy to them (because the experience of Ottomans giving privileges to some identity and finding that identity against itself with an imperial ally repeated over and over). Well prophecy fulfilled itself and guess what? Kurds rebelled again just after the new state was established again allied with an imperial power: the British. This rebellion again silenced by force. But this time it was no routine business, this time it was a matter of survival. After 1920's, until 1980's Turkey could not find a solution other than postponing the problem. During that era Turkey being a member of NATO within a Cold War frame helped any major imperial power using that soft spot against Turkey. The only exception to that is Syria (who was at that time an ally of Soviets whom would support any movement that would weaken any NATO member). Hafız Esad, father of Basser, had a dream of annexing Hatay from Turkey to Syria. Actually, imo, he has more contribution during the foundation of PKK than Abdullah Öcalan himself. Afrin if not first was one of the first places that PKK find a base even in 1980's. This part is important because of the sentimental value of Afrin for PKK/PYD/YPG/PGJ/KCK/TAK or whatever any Apoist establishment. Especially considering Afrin, OOB is a revenge of last 40 years of PKK violence for an average Turkish. What they call themselves are not important, any Apo poster is enough for them to be arrested, any gun barrel pointed (regardless of any reason to be stated) to any citizen of Turkey is enough for them to be ""neutralized"". Not because they are Kurds, not even they rebelled, because they ally with an imperial power against them. This pattern rings an alarm bell that warns about an existence of a matter of survival situation. And once this alarm is triggered, I recommend any outsider not to expect any rational and/or civilized reactions from Turks. Any living organization behaves differently and of course dangerously, when there is a matter of survival. Most of the Turks believe that, if that Gulenist coup had succeeded, they would go after Hatay from their base in Afrin. So any aggression against Afrin or other YPG held areas, is a message to US, who is perceived as the real threat.

4) In spite of hundreds of years of bloody affairs, Turks and Kurds are mostly ok to live together. There are millions who are half Turkish half Kurdish. Majority of Kurdish people live in Turkish dominated urban areas. If center of gravity for Kurds was towards independence, whatever Turks (us) did, they would have their independent state by now. Maybe if Turkey was not in ME, they would have their state in peaceful terms, who knows. But this is ME, and an independent Kurdish State would be an open prison for them. They know it and this causes a base of natural alliance that endured all impossible times since 15'th century until now. For me first condition for the promise given by Atatürk to be fulfilled is Turkey herself to feel powerful enough in order not to get alerted by an outsider imperial intervention to cause another hostile division. Second condition is that any pro Kurdish movement should be peaceful and pro Turkish, not pro British, pro Soviet or pro USA. As long as these conditions are satisfied I would be very happy to negotiate any Kurd about any rights that they demand.

C-Jen,,,"Whatever the expansions are, they'd have to stick with canon, so we probably won't see any of the EU stuff, which is a shame.

If I could dream up an expansion, it would be a Thrawn expansion. (There is already one such fan made expansion on BoardGameGeek, which came out before the Rise of the Empire official expansion.) I haven't really followed much of the canon Thrawn, beyond the book (which appeared to have lots of references I didn't get to Rebels), but the EU Thrawn legends were amazing.

One that lends itself very well to the galactic scale could be the Thrawn/Zaarin rivalry in the TIE Fighter game. Basically, the TIE Fighter game strongly implied that the Emperor was facing far more dangerous threats internally from his own military leaders than he faced from the Rebels. One rogue admiral, Harkov, defected to the Rebels and had to be put down by Vader. Another high ranking admiral (perhaps even Grand Admiral) Zaarin mounted a coup against the Emperor and had to be neutralized by Thrawn.

This expansion could give the Empire some very strong war machines (TIE Avengers, TIE Defenders, Assault Gunboats, and Missile Gunboats were all introduced as Zaarin's and Thrawn's designs during this civil war) and an elite new leader (Thrawn himself could be something like a 4 Space 1 Ground leader with extremely powerful Action Cards), but also force the Empire to hunt down rogue Imperial units.

UniverseInH,bucuresti,B,"&gt; Exact, DACA. Eu unul nu sunt dispus sa cred astfel de personaje sinistre (Udrea scoate un copil din ea in Costa Rica doar ca sa scape de inchisoare... WTF) pana nu isi demonstreaza afirmatiile intr-o instanta de judecata. Daca tu esti dispus, bravo tie, dar marturisesc ca nu te inteleg decat din punctul de vedere a unei credinte pe care o ai deja, ce iti este validata de Udrea si Ghita.

Ad hominem. 

&gt;Nu ar mai fi un singur vinovat in lumea asta daca judecatorii ar asculta doar pledoaria si versiudnea acuzatului. Nu reiese absolut nimic din ce zice aia acolo, decat ca aia e versiunea ei.

**Iti dai seama ca vorbesti despre un om nevinovat, nu?**

&gt;Achitari se intampla oriunde in lumea asta. Asta nu inseamna ca e un abuz sau orice altceva de genul asta, decat daca numarul acestor achitari devine foarte mare sau exista un sablon clar, demonstrat in instante. Ceea ce nu e valabil pt DNA, avand o medie a achitarilor / an sub cea europeana, in conditii mult mai nefavorabile (buget, restructuri din cauza hotararilor CCR si a legilor neclare, opozitie acerba din partea clasei politice, etc.).

Arata-mi o tara care are 12,2% pe an achitari.

&gt;Colaborarile cu SRI au fost legale (neloiale nu stiu ce inseamna in contextul asta???). Probele culese in acest mod au fost in continuare considerate valide de instantele de judecata. Decizia CCR nu e retroactiva si nu scoate DNAul in ilegalitate, ci pur si simplu clarifica ceva ce legiuitorul (Parlamentul) a lasat neclar. DNAul a lucrat pe legile existente, nu e treaba sa sa prevada ce interpretari va da CCRul pe legile in vigoare. Plus ca daca aveau din prima buget pentru propriul serviciu de urmarire, ar fi putut fi invinuiti ca nu-l au. Insa nu au avut asa ceva, de asta au fost nevoiti sa se bazeze pe expertiza SRI.

Nu au fost legale. Citeste ce a scris tipa judecator despre legalitatea inregistrarilor pe siguranta nationala:

*""Vorbind despre decizia CCR, nu credeti, stimati colegi, ca ar fi momentul sa ne intrebam fiecare de ce am acceptat ani de zile ca executarea mandatelor de supraveghere tehnica, care reprezinta evident un procedeu probatoriu, sa fie facuta de SRI, in conditiile in care art.13 din Legea 14/1992 le interzice expres sa faca acte de cercetare penala?""*

Citeste si ce a zis Girbovan despre colaborarea DNA - SRI si agentii din justitie.

&gt;Cat despre probe, chiar si in fragmentul din Cotidianul se arata clar ca inregistrarea exista, nu a fost falsificata. Kovesi a explicat in detaliu acest aspect: s-a gresit la transcrierea inregistrarii, au trebuit schimbate cateva cuvinte, insa proba in sine a existat si a fost in continuare acceptata ca valida de catre judecator. De aici si pana la abuz si nu mai stiu ce, cale lunga. Poate daca un procuror nu ar mai avea cate 80 de dosare in administrare ina celasi timp s-ar evita astfel de greseli, nu?

Citez din hotarare ""procesul verbal de transcriere este **falsificat**"". Adica acolo s-a comis o infractiune.

Nud e alta dar eu de fiecare data, si am facut asta de mult prea multe ori, cand am inceput sa verific un articol de pe Luju.ro, am ajuns la concluzia ca au prezentat doar o parte din poveste sau pur si simplu au spus neadevaruri, doar pentru a dramatiza o anumita stire.

wewiusladius4,,,"&gt;It says exactly that - reducing the number of guns reduces gun homicides/suicides as well as overall homicides/suicides. I quoted this for you elsewhere, but you ignored it. All of this is taken from the conclusion at the end of the document.

The only reduced numbers are gun suicides, however this does not reduce overall suicide rates as the vast majority of suicides are by non-gun means. If guns were significant enough in suicides there should have been a correlation with overall suicide rates and gun ownership. There was no such correlation. I never said there would be a substitution effect, I said the decrease in gun suicides would not significantly lower the overall suicide rates.

&gt;More gun homicides and suicides the more guns there are:

No, only gun suicides and gun homicides involving women. Total gun homicides (involving both genders) or gun homicides involving only men were NOT significant. Let me explain.

https://imgur.com/a/CfLQ0

See the p. values for ""with gun"" and ""with gun - men""? They are not significant.

In other words, countries with higher gun ownership did NOT have higher total gun homicide rates or gun homicides involving men. The only significant gun homicide observed was for women, however, women make up a tiny minority of gun homicides, thus they do not significantly impact the gun homicide rate.

Gun ownership =/= higher total gun homicides in Europe. The only effect observed was for gun suicides and gun homicides involving women only.

captchalove,,,"&gt;I should clarify that a long-standing myth promoted by Apartheid was that SA was largely empty and whites and blacks entered it together from opposite directions. In reality, black people settled in SA nearly 2,000 years ago and had long settled as far South-West as the Eastern Cape by the time of the first arrival of Europeans. The remaining land was hunting and grazing land for Bushman hunter-gatherers and Xhoi-Xhoi herders. Only liars claim that Europeans claimed unused land.

This isn't 100% right - the history behind this belief is a bit more nuanced than that. 

Until the 1960s, mainstream historians believed that blacks and whites came to South Africa at more or less the same time, and that whites were the first to live in the western half of the Cape region. (As far as I'm aware, nobody ever questioned that Khoi and San people are the original inhabitants of South Africa.) This notion was used by the National Party to justify white rule, but it did not originate from them, it simply reflected the best available evidence at the time.

Then, in the 1950s and 60s, the work of archaeologists and the discovery of radiocarbon dating led to mounting evidence that blacks were present in the northernmost part of South Africa by the 11th century, and reached the Kei River by the time the whites were in the Cape. The NP chose to disregard this discovery, as it didn't suit their political narrative. The second half of the statement, that whites are no less 'indigenous' to the Cape region than blacks, is still regarded as correct.",True,0,1519907954,,False,0,dv0g72i,False,t3_8143fx,True,t1_dv0ed7w,/r/worldnews/comments/8143fx/south_aftrican_parliament_votes_to_seize_land/dv0g72i/,1524699387,5,True,False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,public,

You're wrong pal. Wrong and stupid.

Also, there isn't anti-semitism in the Labour Party, it's a made up smear, and also Dianne Abbot isn't racist, as there is no such thing as reverse racism against white people.

Well, I'm Irish and my uncle was in the IRA, so I actually like a lot of what they did, especially Patrick Magee, down in Brighton in '84. Now that was spectacular.

However, if you asked anyone who was actually in the 'RA if they believed Jeremy Corbyn supported them, they would tell you of course not. He reached out for peace talks, in the open, with full scrutiny, unlike what Thatcher did behind closed doors.

So, the IRA smears won't work on me, because I know all about the IRA, and they had no backing or collaboration with Corbyn whatsoever. My uncle hadn't even heard of him until he became big in the news, and he was in the PIRA's Belfast Brigade.

OdeToLiberty,,,"&gt; I suppose your position is viable if you're also a tyrant and want to oppress your own people.

It's also viable if you want foreign nations to remain uninvolved in your domestic politics.

&gt; Countries surrounding China now are very happy with American global leadership

Of course they are. China seems to be set on expanding and reclaiming its former clay, tilting the balance of power in that tender region. People are always happier with the status quo.

&gt; countries in Eastern Europe are also very happy with American leadership (similar to Western Europe during the height of the Cold War).

Of course they are. The US provides security against Russia, a supposedly expansionist power hell-bent on world conquest and whatnot.

But this is not my point. My point was never that American leadership is unpopular, my point was that many would argue that China's authoritarianism is nothing to worry about because China generally steers clear of interfering in the domestic politics of foreign nations. These are two very different points, and I'm quite certain that you know that.

&gt; Your moral relativism is morally bankrupt

Well, that's all relative, isn't it?

&gt; If countries cannot exist without a totalitarian form of government then they shouldn't exist. Period.

Says who? Allow me to say it again: democracy and liberalism are traditionally western ideas. These western ideas do not work across the globe, no matter how much you believe these ideas to be the ideal makeup of a government. What right do you have to say that China shouldn't exist merely because they have not 'embraced' democracy? Authoritarian governments are occasionally necessary for stability and peace.

AnotherAvgAsshole,,,"Interestingly, in what would perhaps lend to your point. Violence doesn't have to be physical, and actuality of the same can be present through behavioural inhibitions. For the purpose of violence being restrictive or curbing in nature, any other actions which does the same could also possibly be termed as violence.


And if I understand what you intend to say, it's that such penal provisions are restrictive in nature. This is known as the [chilling effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_effect). If I know that there are some actions which are vague or whose consequences are over-broad such that the consequences are not proportionate to the supposed harm caused, it is in violation of one's right to free speech. One would in effect *chill* their own actions so that they wouldn't suffer consequences.


And in this seemingly predominantly liberal/left-leaning society, there is (what some would consider) a valid “fear” from the other side that their opinion is being cut down.


Now what I'm trying to get at, is that no right an unfettered right, even the right to free speech irrespective of it's core nature or fundamental aspect in the functioning of our democratic society. Some rights can be restricted in the interests of the rights of others. Like a call for violence if it has a proximate connection to the violence can be penalise. But you might obviously counter, that might be there, but this is merely speech that is offensive. And in fact, regarding this, the ECtHR (European Court of Human Rights) in the 70s held that speech cannot be restricted simply because it [offend, shocks or disturbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handyside_v_United_Kingdom). 
But what is also recognised regarding Continental Jurisprudence (and accepted/followed by IACtHR, AfCtHPR) is that some places have what is called a [Margin of Appreciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_of_appreciation). That is, governments are in a better position than the European Court of Human Rights, to determine the necessity of restricting certain actions considering the factual matrix of that region. That there might exist socio-political background/historical incidents that might have occurred in the past, therefore what might be acceptable in some places might not be acceptable otherwise.


Now obviously what has occurred is that the French Govt. is of the opinion that the right of certain individuals must be protected otherwise there could be some harm caused to individuals of certain communities or because of certain historical socio-political events that might have occurred.

Now to be frank, I will admit that I personally am not in favour of broad restrictive speech even ones that might supposedly offend individuals to a great degree. You can, if you choose to do so, refer to [Bakri vs Film Council (a decision by an Israeli Court)](https://globalfreedomofexpression.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bakri-v.-Israel-Film-Council_0.pdf) where even recognising the nature of speech it was found that govt's have very limited powers when it comes to restricting speech. (Note: This is in the thread of *offend, shock, disturb*, but it is a fascinating case regardless).


Anyway, I've digressed a lot, IDK if you'll even read all of this but i guess


**TL;DR** 


Yes, speech cannot be restricted merely because it offends, shocks or disturbs individuals. Otherwise, that would result in a chilling speech; it would curb artistic speech, result in only certain socio-political opinions being spread which is not really democratic.
But, it  can still be restricted to protect the rights of others.

baseballkrba_10,,,"This is actually an amazingly complex set of questions and I would be happy to help. I am a long time DM and I studied history in college. I am building an RPG and setting to better depict ancient and medieval Europe through more authentic use of history, culture, folklore, language, and geography. I would be happy to discuss with you some of the actual history as well as some things I have implemented which work for me and others which don't.

For starters, this will be your world. What you say goes. Whatever geography you want is totally acceptable. However, geography has major effects on history, demographics, and culture. If you are like me, you want people and cultures in your world to in some ways reflect the geography. For example, people shouldn't have wood houses in an area that doesn't have a lot of trees, like Greece. I always try and use the real world as much as I can for this. I imagine a geography I want to produce in an area of my world, then I look at real world maps and landscapes which depict that geography. What are people in that area wearing? What do they build their houses out of? Does that area have access to roads, the sea, or deep rivers? Overall, I would give very careful consideration to geography. Popular fantasy is dominated by Early Renaissance/Late Medieval England. I believe that setting is getting sort of stale, so lets break out of that. 

Now that geography is out of the way, lets consider who is living there. Lets start with the bottom up:

Houses and the household: Interior space is something we really take for granted in our modern era. We spend a vast majority of our time ""inside"". Pre-modern peoples, however, pretty much only went inside to sleep and escape bad weather. They probably didn't have much of a concept of ""inside"". For that reason, I try and think of medieval houses much more like we think of tents. A possible and interesting exception may be among the very wealthy. 

Houses came in many shapes and sizes depending on location. For ordinary people, they would be the cheapest materials in that location. In rocky, rugged, and dry Greece, they were made of rough stone and plaster, while in northern Europe you would see more wood and sod. Most of these houses would only be a few rooms which where shared by a multi-generational family. There wasn't much privacy and things would have been really cramped. 

Villages: Westward expansion in America made it so families would go out to their remote farms and build there houses in the middle of nowhere. This is NOT how Europe did it. You family probably couldn't survive very long on their own in the frontier. A band of raiders or army would see that as easy pickings. So in Europe, typical farmers lived in villages and walked a few miles to their farms in the morning and back home at night. As a result, the European countryside is dotted with webs of villages. A villager couldn't spend all day walking to his farmland, so I would imagine that the most distant cultivated land belonging to that village was between 5-10 miles. After leaving those most distant farmlands of a particular villages, you might run into forests or the neighboring village's farmlands. 

The Wilderness: The Romans and Greeks believed that it was mankind's destiny to bring civilization and order to a otherwise chaotic natural world. Romans actually had a religious boundary surrounding their towns called a pomerium which sort of separated law and order from nature and chaos. The point is, the wilderness was very often seen as a cold, dark, and dangerous place in European history. Its were monsters supposedly roam and bandits take shelter. As a result Europeans tended to cluster their villages together with forests around the villages and not between them. 

Towns: I wouldn't separated towns and villages by number of citizens, but by specialization of labor. In a village, a peasant sort of has to be a jack of all trades and master of none. They all have to till their own fields, care for their own animals, repair their own homes, fix their own tools, butcher their own meat, etc. Their probably wasn't much specialized labor in villages for a variety of reasons. Towns, on the other hand, could support craftsmen, and in my mind, that is what makes a town a town. There isn't enough work for a blacksmith in a village, but their is a town. And if a villager needs something which he cant make, he might walk from the village to the town. Whenever I place a town on the map, I try and think why it is a town and not just another village. Why did the town grow? Why could it support specialized labor? If a village is near a bridge, you would imagine more people passing through that village and you could imagine it becoming a town. Perhaps and area is exceptionally fertile and can support a more dense population.

Cities- Villages and towns would have been everywhere, but cities would be much more rare. It takes a lot of infrastructure for a city to form and survive. Rome, for example, couldn't feed itself. Italy, for that matter, couldn't feed the city of Rome at it height. The Romans had to import a vast majority of their grain from Sicily and Egypt. Athens got most of their grain from Greek colonies on the Black Sea. The point it, very specific things must align in order for a city to form. Usually, there needs to be a trade route or port very close by. Often cities were on major rivers or the coast. 

Honestly, I would write a lot more about this, but I already have a wall of text.

Treść mojego zdania była taka, że użycie słowa 'kwintesencja' w twoim zdaniu było bez sensu. 'Kwintesencja' oznacza albo piąty żywioł w kosmologii Arystotelesa, albo w sensie metaforycznym najistotniejsza cecha danej rzeczy. _G_ nie jest cechą, i nie użyłeś jej tak z resztą w zdaniu. Powiedziałeś, jakby to było coś namacalnego.

*Coś, czego nie zrozumiałeś. Lamarck (a zatem wczesny Spencer i jego normatywne stwierdzenia dot. społeczeństwa) jako pierwszy przyszedł mi do głowy, jako osoba która tłumaczyła fenomeny dziedziczne używając fałszywej, mieszającej  _nature and nurture_ metody.

Nie ma w moich odpiwiedziach ani nic intelektualnego, ani pseudointelektualnego; wydaję mi się, że używasz zwrotu do własnego braku zrozumienia jako wyłącznej podpory.

'Azali, gdy ktoś na internecie mówi coś, co ci się nie podoba, to jest nic innego niż ukryta, czychająca zawsze w zakamarkach _lewicowa propaganda_! Strzeż się, obywatelu!'

A ja na przykład widzę, że nie znalzłeś lepszego argumentu niż zawsze mocarnego 'nie rozumiem [lub nie chcę], więc ignoruję' oraz po prostu karykaturalnego _argumentum ad personam_ (nie obeszłoby się)..

Genotypy są dziedziczne, nie fenotypy. Słowo 'populacja' użyłem skrótowo tak, ja uważałem że masz na myśli- tzn. kliny kontynentalne- Europejczycy, Azjaci, Afrykanie, itd.- w praktyce tzw. 'biali, czarni, żółci'.

Nie wymienialiśmy się statystykami, więc ten wytrysk jest raczej nie pokolei. Jakoś wątpie, żebyś wytężał oczy za bardzo, czytając komenty, bo _sam stwierdziłem rację_ tych i analogicznych statystyk. Natomiast o konkluzje których chcesz, trzeba będzie trochę powalczyć- i to pod górkę, bo wbrew innym danym historycznym i naukowym.

Podaję ci zarówno fakty i argumentację, a ty tak boisz się ewentualnie przyznać mi rację, że mówisz 'bełkot'. Sorry.

I tutaj chciałbym powiedzieć, że jestem osobą raczej pobłażliwą, chętną do podjęcia, że ten, z kim rozmawiam również stara się przynajmniej argumentować na podstawie moich faktycznych stwierdzeń.

Przeczytaj całą nitkę jescze raz, jeśli musisz, ale stracha na wróble którego sobie podstawiłeś za mnie po prostu tu nie ma.

 /Czarno na białym: nie nigdy, nie twierdziłem wyższości lepianek (chociaż o zamku Fasylidesa, Wlk. Zimbabwe i Wlk. Meczetu w Djenné chciałoby się napomknąć) ani nad chatami Europy i jej pałacami, ani nad wybudowanymi przez jej cywilizacje (l. mnoga) bogactwa kulturowego, historycznego itd., którym jak zapewne wiesz, niewątpliwie sprzyjał poziomy, otoczony morzami, umiarkowany w klimacie i niespotykanie bogaty w zwierzęta hodowlane charakter geograficzny./

Jak mówiłem, myślisz, że konkluzja jest zawarta w przesłance. Nazywa się to 'argument z potwierdzenia konsekwencji' i jest to błąd logiczny. Wygląda tak:

(Niech: A =&gt; B)
Przesłanka: B
Zatem, A

W twoim przypadku, B to tzw. czarni mają obecnie statystycznie niższe IQ od białych; a A- w cokolwiek byś chciał wierzyć na temat pseudonauki i powodowania tego stanu rzeczy, tych warunków.

ShakaUVM,mod,Mod | Christian,"&gt;Were there Buddhist holy wars?

Yes

&gt;Was the violence condoned or initiated by the religion or committed by the religions followers. 

If ""by the religion"" you mean the leaders, then both.

&gt;If yes, Can you elaborate and site sources?  

There are many examples on Wikipedia: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism_and_violence

An easy cite is Stephen Turnbull's book on Warrior Monks in Japan: 
https://www.amazon.com/Japanese-Warrior-Monks-AD-949-1603/dp/1841765732

Pay especial attention to the sections where the Buddhist monasteries would use physical violence with the armed monks to pressure the emperor into doing things their way.

Despite Buddhism's reputation for being pacifistic, this more has to do with the poor quality of history education in the West than anything else.

It's akin to a history teacher in Nepal claiming that western European countries are peaceful because Jesus was a pacifist.

Marxists will tell you that it's merely a manmade law, and will carefully omit the fact that Manu gains his authority from the superhuman Vedas, the [Yajurveda (2.10)](http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/yv/yv02.htm) specifically which states:

The last straw being having a post I made not only removed from the main page but comments locked and no response from the moderators when I challenged them. I feel a bit of admiration for the WOC who push back against the rampant racism here, but also futility. I appreciate so much of this sub’s posts but the acknowledgement of how white feminists have contributed to white supremacy and the dehumanizing of WOC, which in part explains to me why so many WOC understand that however being a woman is defined the defining shouldn’t be the purview of white feminists and are open to examining other definitions, especially when current gender norms and roles have been forced on so many of us and historical cultural notions of gender have been subjugated by the colonizers which so many on this sub deny or dismiss.

Article:

&gt;U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Thursday he would impose tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum, in a move the administration said would protect U.S. industry, but which critics said would fail to boost jobs and risked stoking a trade war with China.

&gt; Trump, speaking after a meeting with U.S. steel and aluminum makers said the duties would be formally announced next week.

&gt; ""We're going to build our steel industry back and our aluminum industry back,"" he said.

&gt; News of the tariffs drove the stocks of U.S. domestic steel and aluminum makers sharply higher, but also hit sentiment on Wall Street due to the potential impact of higher costs on consumers.

&gt; The move, which came after what one person with direct knowledge of the discussions described as a night of ""Chaos"" in the White House due to frequent switching of positions in the administration, was sharply criticized by some senior Republican legislators.

&gt; ""Every time you do this, you get a retaliation. Agriculture is the number one target. I think this is terribly counterproductive for the agriculture economy,"" said Senator Pat Roberts, who chairs the chamber's agriculture committee.

&gt; China has already threatened to curb imports of U.S. soybeans in retaliation, while the European Union has said it will consider action as well.

&gt; China's top trade official Lui He is in Washington for trade talks.

&gt; AK Steel Holding was up almost 12 percent, U.S. Steel Corp was up 8 percent and Nucor rose 3.6 percent.

&gt; By contrast, industrial stocks such as Boeing fell, with traders citing tariffs, which would hit manufacturers' costs.

&gt; The administration says duties would protect U.S. industry, but critics say they would raise costs for industry and fail to deliver on a campaign pledge to boost domestic jobs.

&gt; It had appeared unlikely that Trump would announce the tariffs on Thursday after a night of back and forth inside the administration.

&gt; ""There was a lot of movement within the past 12, 16 hours,"" said the source who had knowledge of the discussions, but who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.

&gt; ""It was going to happen. It wasn't going to happen and then it did happen.""

&gt; The administration has also cited national security interests for its action, saying the United States needs domestic supply for its tanks and warships.

&gt; Contrary to the action announced by Trump on Thursday, the Department of Defense had recommended targeted steel tariffs and a delay in aluminum duties.

&gt; Although China only accounts for two percent of U.S. steel imports, its massive industry expansion has helped produce a global glut of steel that has driven down prices.

&gt; Trade tensions between the United States and China have risen since Trump took office in 2017 and the administration is also pushing on what it regards as forced technology transfers to China.

&gt; Shares of Asian steel producers such as South Korea's POSCO and Nippon Steel fell overnight.

&gt; FEW MORE JOBS FROM TARIFFS While American steelmakers have lost three quarters of their jobs between 1962 and 2005, a major study by the American Economic Association showed that much of this had been due to improved production technology as output per worker rose fivefold.

&gt; ""Thus, even if trade protection leads to increased domestic production, increases in employment may be far less than many hope,"" a report from the highly-regarded independent Econofact economist network said last week.

&gt; Consumers of steel and aluminum have lobbied hard against the tariffs.

&gt; Econofact said in its report that two million jobs were in industries that use steel ""Intensively"", including auto parts, household appliances, farm machinery and oil equipment.

&gt; Jobs in the consuming industries are concentrated in California, Texas, the Northeastern and Midwestern states that comprise the rust belt and states in the Southeast.

&gt; ""Across many states, the number of jobs adversely affected in these steel-using industries could far exceed any steel jobs saved,"" Econofact warned.

Europe is far left over all compared to the world and I would say that America leans a little left on the global stage of politics.   So it would make more sense to say that the 'right' is rare in Europe then it would be to say that 'left' is rare in America without referencing a specific political system.

&gt;So here’s the question, if the Hebrews were of dark tone, and Jews are forbidden to mix with non Jews, how did the skin tone end up white and with no appearance of middle eastern/African features?

I don't think this is true, many Ashkenazi carry features of the middle east. Features like black curly hair, large noses, etc are quite common in the middle east. Especially in the Levant. I think the idea that Ashkenazi Jews did not intermix with Europeans is preposterous. I am sure if any Ashkenazi Jew on this subreddit did a DNA test, they will show signs of European ancestry and this has been true in most studies. Although most are largely Jewish, they never are entirely Jewish genetically. Additionally, Judaism only requires that the mother be Jewish for the child to be Jewish. 

You might be surprised at how white the middle-east has been as well, people in the Levant can come off as quite light skinned as well.

Obviously there's going to be a lot of subjectivity about what constitutes a fear campaign, but when he literally says ""you should be frightened,"" I think I have a pretty good argument.

&gt; Corruption I feel is talked about a lot but proven very little, instead we have a clear european procurement policy and tax havens are battled, I've seen no clear signs that corruption is a problem or rampant within EU institutions

&gt; That can be your opinion, the number has grown, lobbying has become more prevalent, however lobbying in general has become much more prevalent 

&gt; Alignment with corporate interest is very far below American level, we are liberalizing trade to the international trade perspective but the EU is not catering to companies to any large extent

&gt;Increasing alignment with NATO and US, not so weird since Turkey has been more agesssive politically and Russia is engaged in information warfare. We have just found a way to state a shared external policy, imo one of the most important aspects of the EU, military and energy security 

&gt;Legislation process is difficult, but Member States eventually ratify nearly every piece of legislation itself, unless they have mandates the commission to. 

&gt; eroding social and humanitarian values... we are pretty much the most progressive and tolerant society these days, what are you comparing it to? Colonialism or the US 70's? Also national parties have gotten more right wing, not the EU, because of the migrant crisis. 

&gt; Expoloitation of NGOs, Front agencies, refugees. I don't really understand what form of exploitation you mean, can't comment. But refugees are not exploited, there is just not enough capacity to house them properly due to migrant crisis, not as much EU the organization as Member States

&gt; increasing surveillance.. GDPR is the most extensive protection of personal data in the world, about to be introduced, still number 1 progressive of all continents

&gt; All pieces are published, if you disagree write an academic paper on it

&gt; Yes, criminals have free movement too, just like every student and worker, so still not that bad

&gt;This one is not even an argument. It's called a customs union, US corporate governance is dangerous, this is just a states affair. Companies don't hold as much power as you think in the EU. Dire influences of Monsanto and Phillip Morris have been combatted, and the EU is quite cautious with the power of the tech giants.

A beautiful song by a unique Hungarian folk singer. I was a junior in high school, and I believe I heard it on ""Fresh Air"" after school one day, probably within a month or so of having discovered Dead Can Dance. My mom and I both thought it was Indian music, so it was especially shocking when the guitar came in and the whole thing suddenly sounded European, but still alien and unfamiliar. We hear sounds like this in TV and movies all the time now (I am still amazed that the Armenian duduk has become the primary signifier of ""eastern mystery""), but it was rare in 1993 to hear ""world music"" on daytime talk radio.

ziptofaf,,,"Well, domain names aren't exactly expensive in the first place. If you go with something regional/not-top-level then it can be as little as around 1-2€ per year. Eg. here's .ovh: 

https://www.ovh.co.uk/domains/dotovh.xml

Even decent domain names like .eu are sub 5€ a year nowadays. Buy it once and remember that all subdomains are free (so if you get a domain example.com then test.example.com, troll.example.com etc are all included in that), it will also be necessary for sending emails that won't get flagged as spam, it's also kinda the only way to RECEIVE emails as well. Meaning that domains are quite important if you are building a web application.  

Of course there ARE ways to not pay a cent but but they would only work for you and would trigger warnings and errors for everyone else. But if you are interested, there are following concepts you could look into (but it's only if you are doing it to learn how this stuff works, it makes no sense otherwise):

* firstly, domain names. How does you typing reddit.com lead you to 151.101.193.140 IP? Answer is - via DNS servers. Those are the ones translating domain names into addresses. Now, it IS possible to run your own DNS server. Then you can create any domain you wish (or even take an existing one and pretend to be google.com if you feel like it). This is actually often done in companies to create INTERNAL domain zones. So rather than remembering that our main server has an IP 192.168.1.99 you can just type main-server.example.com. This will only work from within a company however, not from the global internet. If you are interested in trying it out for some reason then look into [BIND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIND). 
* secondly, there's nothing stopping you from deploying your own HTTPS certificate. [Here's an example](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-ssl-certificate-on-apache-for-ubuntu-14-04). This would let you use HTTPS without having a domain name. To explain - the only difference between you signing your own HTTPS certificate and a company like DigiCert doing it for you is that your browser knows who DigiCert is and knows that their certs can be trusted. If you do it then it will complain that it's an untrusted certificate. It doesn't however mean it won't work. Eg. this is how my [home router address looks like](https://puu.sh/zyvC2/5adae5ed74.png) - and yes, it has HTTPS enabled. 

So if you are doing it just for the sake of testing then sure, you can spoof domain names and make your own certificates, no big deal. But with how cheap these things are nowadays (literally $2 per year for a domain and free certificates) it makes very little sense to go out of your way with such hacky solutions.

So the fact that America contributes the lions share of funds to a pact designed mainly to defend Europe is a bit odd. 

Just looking at the rest of the CNN link posted above, the next biggest spenders (as a percentage of GDP) is Greece which...is not exactly a wealthy nation these days.

newnewacct,Glenn,Metacanadian,"I've posted elsewhere, long explanations of why our exports are so reliant on the US. 

We have one warm water port. ONE in Vancouver that we can ship goods out of year round. We have the St. Laurence the other part of the year running as well. We obviously have way more exports than that, so we ship a shitload of stuff through the US to the Gulf of Mexico, to get shipped around the world.

If the US wants to put a tariff on Canadian goods, not only would everything we export to the US be hit with a tariff, but so would anything we ship to Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and some of Asia (depends on capacity in Vancouver).

As much as people want to pretend Canada doesn't need the US, we'd be fucked without them, and with no free trade deal they'd lose 8% of their GDP, while we'd be reduced to a borderline developing nation. Imagine if we lost upwards of 30% of our GDP.

""We'll trade with a different country!""

We literally can not trade with another country without going through US territory. Our ports are already maxed out, and our rail infrastructure is specifically designed to go down to Chicago, and then to various US ports. 

If we wanted to be self reliant after getting a massive GDP hit, it would take 100's of billions (if not trillions) of dollars to rearrange our rail infrastructure, build a new highway structure, build new ports, which would take decades.

All the while our GDP has been but by 25% +, so we have no fucking money, and we now have a barrier to entry in the largest marketplace in the world, which just so happens to be right next door, and the whole reason we're so prosperous.

There's zero reason why we shouldn't have a mutually beneficial relationship with the US when it comes to trade and economics, and it's time to tweak NAFTA. Canada could even get some things in there that benefited our country. Let them bring their dairy, concede a bit on softwood lumber, and get them to get rid of their corn subsidy. 

Please let them bring their wireless carriers to Canada. I'd love a $20 phone plan.

Caridor,,"Anyone but May, anyone but May","&gt;But you're telling them there is a relationship between the abuse and being Muslim? Am I understanding you right?

No, quite literally the opposite. The initial comment on this thread was saying how we don't have data to say that. Look, I won't say I understand the anguish these people went through because I haven't experienced anything like it but I can imagine that they'd want to blame someone, anyone for the things that happened to their children. That's just human nature. They'll be angry and immeasurably sad at the same time and perhaps not thinking clearly but still, I could not lie to them and confirm what we don't know to be true. 

&gt;But there are sizeable Muslim communities that explicitly do not want to mix, integrate or assimilate. It's a doctrinal and cultural thing.

But there are Muslim communities that do. Let's start with them. Also, over time people can have their barriers broken down. They may not integrate at first but the first step can be something as simple as the guy at KFC saying ""Oh hi, do you want the usual then?"". 

&gt;I think we already see what happens.

I think we're seeing first stage of what happens. It's a process. It takes time. 

&gt;Isn't that a bit dystopian?

What? A world in which war and boundaries are gone? I don't think so. Perhaps it's a fairy tale but to others, it's an ideal and a goal. A goal which I believe we can reach. Human history has been a long history of humans coming together to form greater and greater unions. First you had tribes, then groups of villages to form the first tiny nations and skip ahead a few thousand years and we have a nearly united Europe and unions like the UN. Surely a global union is only a few steps further on that evolution?

&gt;That makes you sound ambivalent about it

To be frank, I am. A war between global super powers would end the world pretty quick, so it's either a happy future, the status quo for the rest of my life or a blinding flash followed by whatever awaits beyond the grave.

AVOID! In my experience these guys just find something that grows like crazy and stick a bunch of it in. Usually turns out to be something invasive. I've seen people with European buckthorn hedges....

When dealing with drainage $1000 won't get you very far for something on this scale. My suggestion for diverting water would be to terrace the slope to direct the flow of water, using steps to get from one to the next. Ultimately directing the water to a part of the yard you don't mind flooding. However this is something that has to be done right or it becomes dangerous. Alternatively, you could try to alter the grading on the hill and bottom so that water goes somewhere unimportant. 

As for cutting less grass, it's the same situation. You could put in groundcovers, but then you have to remove the sod, dispose of it, buy plants, buy mulch, etc. Plants are not cheap, and mulch adds up too. If you were to just plant a bunch of fast-growing shrubs, I feel that they would just get overgrown and things would look worse.

All in all, this is a tough situation. Low budget and large area makes fixing things difficult.",True,0,1519945225,,False,0,dv1in9g,False,t3_817leh,True,t3_817leh,/r/landscaping/comments/817leh/need_ideas/dv1in9g/,1524718218,3,True,False,landscaping,t5_2qndi,public,

LikesMoonPies,,,"&gt; Russia's military budget is 70 billion, and china's is 131 billion. Meanwhile, the US military is at 597 billion and the EU budget totals at 226.7 billion. Looking at spending alone, neither Russia nor China wouldn't stand a chance making a move against most Europe, nevertheless the US.

&gt; Xi Jinping and Putin are dangerous, no doubt, but we don't need to be spending 4 times as much as them just to act as a deterrent   

While this seems logical, it is not, and, is a very dangerous way of thinking that seems to be becoming more widespread.  

You can't compare dollars in a meaningful way like this.  For example, a huge difference is wages.  The USA has a much higher COL than either Russia or China and also depends on a entirely volunteer military.  

The USA [pays about 10 times higher wages than China](http://english.chinamil.com.cn/news-channels/china-military-news/2015-01/19/content_6314553.htm) and [as much as 4 times higher wages than Russia.](https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2012-02-01/a-significant-pay-increase-russian-army)    

You could knock $100 - $150 billion off the US budget for that, alone, if we dropped wages on our service members.  

Also, our weapons and warplanes, and warships and submarines are made by US contractors who are also paying US wages which accounts for billions more.    

The EU is not as prepared as you think either.  For example, [the UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_active_United_Kingdom_military_aircraft) and [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Air_Force) combined have ~400 combat jets, while Russia alone has [over 1000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_active_Russian_military_aircraft), not counting those of its allies. 

European nations rely on the US to for training and also help. One of the supposed military powerhouses of the EU, the UK, [had to call in the US 11 times, even after calling for help from France and Canada, in 2015](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/royal-navy-relied-on-nato-to-protect-british-waters-20-times-in-2015-a6870686.html) to send maritime patrol/anti-submarine aircraft to find a Russian sub detected in their own waters, because they had retired their own aircraft years earlier to save money and didn't have money to replace it.

There are obvious advantages over potions - spellcasting is instantaneous and doesn't require specific ingredients.

A second referendum too is to disregard the first vote - which again is undemocratic. (regardless of how democratic the vote is or, indeed, the outcome)

I'm in two minds about the vote on the final decision as we've seen today that the EU STILL wants to dictate to us how this should pan out and it's only going to be okay if it's in their favor. People need to remember that the when the UK joined the EU it was a trade agreement. Not a method for unelected bureaucrats to dictate the the UK how to conduct its business (figuratively speaking). The fact that there are members of parliament who are campaigning to remain in the EU (some in direct contradiction to the vote from their constituencies shows how 'Stockholm' things have become IMHO) is grossly undemocratic.

displaced_martian,,,"My personal position is that it is naive to expect other nations or the USA to attempt to not influence the internal politics of other democracies (or dictatorships) to the benefit of that state.  A statement by the PM of the UK or Israel that they prefer one candidate over another is intentionally influencing the American democratic process.  Any international political action is attempt to sway the policy of other states to your states benefit. 

Transparent actions can be linked by the public and the source of information/position/motivations is readily apparent.  The EU imposing sanctions in response to damages against their own industries will have a political impact.  That impact can be broad or targeted.   The EU choose to impose targeted tariffs.  Targeted tariffs on the political groups who may not realize how they benefit from free trade (ie vote for politicians with protectionist policies).

To me, the important piece is that the influence is transparent.  If the Russian agents had registered as such and acted in accordance with the laws governing foreign government agents, then there would be many fewer issues.  There most certainly would be questions, but those questions would have ready answers.  Russia benefits from a divided and inept US.  Transparency does not work for this objective, historically it would have resulted in the opposite.

To you, it maybe that any attempt to influence a democratic process should be held equally bad.  I do not see how in the modern connected world it is possible for other states to not react to democracies by influencing their populations.

usrname42,economist chetty image mod red-border external pink text,Last night I dreamt I went to Mendeley again,"&gt;This deficit is a serious drain on demand, and does not stem from a strong economy pushing its limits. And with the Federal Reserve Board pushing interest rates down to zero, it had limited capacity to boost demand.

Rates aren't at zero any more, and if reducing the trade deficit did increase demand we'd expect the Fed to raise interest rates faster to offset that effect - if the Fed thinks that the economy is well below capacity at the moment, they wouldn't have increased interest rates already.

&gt;What effect does all this have on American workers? Trade deficits, even in times of strong growth, have negative, concentrated impacts on the quantity and quality of jobs in parts of the country where manufacturing employment diminishes. Even the economists who argue (incorrectly, we believe) that the trade deficit doesn’t affect the total number of jobs do admit that it affects the composition of jobs. There is, for example, a lot of research confirming that deindustrialization in the Rust Belt is partly a result of the fact that America meets its domestic demand for manufactured goods by importing more than it exports. One oft-cited academic study found that imbalanced trade with China led to the loss of more than 2 million U.S. jobs between 1991 and 2011, about half of which were in manufacturing (which worked out to 17 percent of manufacturing jobs overall during that time).

*Trade* certainly affects the composition of jobs, but why would trade *deficits* alter the effect? Would the China shock somehow have had less impact on rust belt manufacturing if other people in the US were, say, exporting a lot of services to Europe, so the overall trade deficit was balanced?

ajehals,UKGB,Royaume-Uni de Grande-Bretagne et d'Irlande du Nord,"&gt; I think that London knows perfectly well that Brussels isn't going to back down and will boot the RoI out of the customs union (and thus EU) before accepting that. Which makes Brussels take the heat for making Ireland do border enforcement.

There is no way the EU is going to boot Ireland out of the customs union, or the EU, nor is Ireland going to allow a hard border.

The sane and frankly still most likely solution is that the UK and Ireland are going to find a mutually acceptable way of managing cross border traffic in goods and customs.  After all, you don't need to do customs checks at the border (you can do it at entry ports, and ad hoc in country) with most of the enforcement done not by customs officers looking at trucks, but by people looking at freight patterns, and documentation, with the odd spot check at logistics hubs and at the roadside (As you see in other parts of the EU at times).

There isn't going to be a hard border in Ireland, the UK doesn't want it, nor does Ireland, and at the end of the day, there are enough viable workarounds that it'd be easier for the EU to accept a technical solution, even if it isn't a great one, than do anything else.

A defesa de Macarrão conseguiu junto ao Tribunal de Justiça de Minas Gerais (TJMG) a progressão do cumprimento de pena no regime semiaberto para o aberto nesta quinta-feira e, consequentemente, foi expedido o alvará de soltura. A progressão da pena foi concedida pelo juiz Antônio Fortes de Pádua Neto, que considerou que Luiz Henrique Ferreira Romão já possuía os requisitos necessários, como cumprimento de tempo no semiaberto e bom comportamento. Ao G1, a advogada de Macarrão, Fabiana Cecília Alves, disse que o cliente vai permanecer em Pará de Minas e quer pagar pelo crime que cometeu. Em 23 de novembro de 2012, o amigo do goleiro Bruno Fernandes foi condenado a 15 anos em regime fechado por homicídio triplamente qualificado – motivo torpe, asfixia e uso de recurso que dificultou a defesa da vítima, a modelo Eliza Samudio – e mais três anos em regime aberto por sequestro e cárcere privado. Ele estava na Penitenciária Nelson Hungria, em Contagem, mas o complexo não aceitava o regime semiaberto, por isso a defesa do preso pediu a transferência para a cidade do interior, na ocasião. Ele foi sentenciado a 22 anos e três meses de prisão pela morte e ocultação do cadáver de Eliza, além do sequestro do filho da jovem.

CFSohard,chf,Canadese in Svizzera - 24 Paese,"Expect Venice to be packed with tourists to the point that walking along the main streets is next to impossible without running into 14 tour busses of people. I highly recommend the side streets.

As for fall activities, there really aren't any comparable to the eastern seaboard, as Venice is located ON water, it's literally stone and water, there's no trees to pick apples from or see the colorful leaves. 

Halloween has a very minor bit of attention, but it's essentially ignored in Europe.

As for Paris, it's a massive city, so I would imagine it would be similar to celebrating the fall in downtown Boston, except many times the size. The surrounding countryside won't be as colorful as the northeast US, but there will be plenty of apple orchards if you look in the right places. Expect to spend a good amount of time on a train getting out to the countryside if you are staying in the city center, as Paris is MASSIVE.

I can't personally attest to fall activities in either place, as I've only visited at other times of the year, but here in Switzerland we have lots of wine harvesting festivals, so you may find some of those. If you want the 'harvest festival' type culture, you'll need to leave the cities for sure, as Venice and Paris are both too large and metropolitan. Otherwise there's plenty to do in the cities themselves, but not much particularly related to fall that I can think of.",True,0,1519956226,,False,0,dv1szwo,False,t3_8190o6,True,t3_8190o6,/r/travel/comments/8190o6/fall_in_france_and_italy_versus_the_united_states/dv1szwo/,1524723194,2,True,False,travel,t5_2qh41,public,

SayNoob,,,"Here is what **Trump hopes will happen:** Canadian steel becomes more expensive in the US, thus the demand for American steel grows, reviving the US steel industry. As an added bonus, Chinese steel industry suffers because they export steel to Canada which then exports it to the US. 

Here is what will **actually happen**. The US steel industry is not capable of meeting the rising demand, so in the short term Canadian steel will still be used but it simply costs more, meaning industries that rely on steel will suffer huge amounts of layoffs and other cost saving measures to make up for the added costs of steel. The EU will file a grievance with the WTO and impose sanctions on US industries which will hurt the economy and destroy the Republican party's election chances.

Going fascist asap and grabbing up as much territory as possible from China during it's war with Japan. Once you build up both new and old territory, you have two choices: 
1. Help Japan win it's war in the east. Japan currently usually joins the Axis, putting you at odds with the Allies. If luck is on your side, you can nab French indochina with ease, giving you precious space to build industry. Your left flank, however, will be much harder. The war with india will be a slog, and while you will probably not make much progress, neither will they if your troops are strong enough and you've properly dug into position.
At this point, it's time to try and get some troops to Europe and paradrop into the U.K.
And that's it, war over. Take as much as you want and proclaim the Siamese Empire with your Axis brethren.
2. Once the war with china is over, it's backstabbing time. Again, your victory relies on paratroopers, as you will never ever get navel dominance against any of the majors. Declare on Japan once you've built up enough to defend your new assets, and drop close to a port city. If you're lucky, you'll manage to take out it's garrison, enabling you to send out the rest of the troops to seize the rest of the islands. If you do this fast enough, the Japanese ai will not react in time to stop your conquering of the islands. If you manage to take out Japan, congrats!

sotonohito,texas-flag,Texas,"&gt; Okay, and...? What's supposed to happen after that?

Then the US is basically out of the picture geopolitically and Russia can act without needing to worry (much) about US interference.

What Putin is mostly after is a free(er) hand. He wants to expand his borders, take over and strongarm the nations that he permits to continue on his border, reabsorb some of the republics that spun off from the USSR that have resources he thinks are worth the trouble, and expand Russia's economy which pretty much exists only as petroleum exports.

The US is potentially an impediment to all that.

Obviously his preference would be for the USA to be his puppet. That's not going to happen anytime soon, if at all. But the US being unable to act internationally due to internal conflicts, its world standing and reputation decaying, and so on is something he thinks he can achieve. Then all he's got to worry about are China and the EU, and those are more manageable if the US has removed itself from the picture via chaos and Trump.

Also, never forget that Putin is an old KGB man, from an era when attempting to exploit white America's racism was really popular in KGB circles. People don't change much after 20, and it seems likely that Putin still thinks a divided USA (ideally divided via racism) is a good policy.

Chaos for its own sake isn't Putin's goal. Chaos for the sake of crippling the USA and allowing him to do what he wants is. Also, I suspect he just doesn't much like the idea of democracy and likes anything that helps undermine it.

VENTDEV,,,"I'm assuming a year 1900 start, Base City Maps, with full AI.

&amp;nbsp;

Focus on North Eastern USA or Western Europe.  You don't have to start in a major city like New York or London, but be close to them. 


&amp;nbsp;


Since you have low starting funds, you'll probably want to avoid wasting a lot of money in component development. So you have two choices to get parts without paying development costs. You can either License the designs and build them your self (automatically when you build the vehicles). Or you can purchase already built units (you get an added bonus to how many vehicles can be made per production line).  


&amp;nbsp;


Since demand is more of a problem than production in early years, I would lean toward licensing components. RnD-&gt;Outsourcing-&gt;License Radio Box-&gt;Change company filter to All.


&amp;nbsp;



Check the reports for the popular body type for the region you're starting in (Reports-&gt;Reports 1-&gt;Body/Fuel Type Demand). If you can find a licensed vehicle design for a popular vehicle type, get it. You can immediately start producing it. Otherwise nab a Chassis/Gearbox/Engine and work on the most popular vehicle type for the area. NA it's normally trucks. EU it's generally Sedans in early years.


&amp;nbsp;



You don't need to build the best vehicle. You don't need to build the cheapest vehicle. But it does have to be affordable. In 1900 that typically means under $1,000 unit costs, and selling it for under $2,000 (in NA/Western EU).


&amp;nbsp;



When you're in the production phase, don't under estimate expansion. If you excess production capacity, try increasing demand by building a new branch in cities with more than 1,000,000 people in them before trying to cut prices (and margins). Alternatively, if you don't have enough factory lines, don't hesitate to increase prices if you're losing a lot of possible sales.


&amp;nbsp;



Always use the Bond system early. Creditors are not stupid. They will not invest in a company that is about to go bankrupt.


&amp;nbsp;



A lot of money can be made in the stock market. Look for companies with positive EPS. Means they're making a profit through sales and not increasing their market cap through debt (cough, Tesla, cough).


&amp;nbsp;



If you need more help, throw me an email, PM, whatever, with more details or even your save game and I can give you pointers. Alternatively, I can put together a profitable save game for the first 2-3 years for you and you can look at the structure of the company.",True,0,1519962066,,False,0,dv1ydo2,False,t3_815l89,False,t1_dv1qwy5,/r/tycoon/comments/815l89/looking_for_more_management_focused_games_like/dv1ydo2/,1524725778,4,True,False,tycoon,t5_2t8iw,public,

Clausewitz1996,novice,Novice,"&gt; Besides, Social science isn't ""hard science"" so anyone can comment on it.

Anyone can comment on a ""hard science"", too. It doesn't make them right. 

To be honest, I've never seen a physicist or chemist or biologist provide *useful* commentary on the nuances of post-Soviet democratization in Eastern Europe or offer cogent advice on labor policy. I've seen them offer soundbites on contentious social issues that have less to do with social science and more with political philosophy, though. Edit: With the exception of a few examples, like Sam Harris--who will actually break down statistical models when talking about social science issues like casualty figures in Iraq--the vast majority of scientists who talk politics are doing so from a philosophical lens. They don't go into the nitty gritty of p-values or sampling methods. They don't cite research in the relevant fields, either. Which is fine--most of us (myself included) rarely bring up academic research when debating policy. However, it really is incorrect to imply we're making comments on issues in social science when we don't actually understand society from a (soft) scientific perspective.

By the way, since when has advanced statistical analysis been commentary? Anyone who boils social science down to mere commentary only interacts with those fields through the opinion page. Roland Fryer's work on police shootings and Ian Bremmer's J-curve are both meticulously researched, sound bodies of work that extend beyond the realm of commentary. 

Also, chemistry and biology are far removed from each other in science? Chemists and biologists conduct collaborative research all the time, especially in the field of medicine.

Din 1990 pana azi am colaborat ca voluntar (neplatit), in secret ca dirijor, compozitor cu cei mai mari muzicieni ai planetei. Astfel incat pe toata planeta, in toate tarile primele (cele mai renumite, premiate  sau importante) dintre toate hiturile muzicale de top internationale, dintre melodiile laureate cu premiile cele mai renumite si premiul intii (si dintre primele locuri la premii), dintre primele 200 hituri din toate topurile si clasamentele muzicale internationale, dintre concertele cele mai renumite, dintre melodiile cele mai renumite, dintre melodiile de la premiile Eurovision, Oscar, Globul de Aur, dintre concertele, festivalurile, concursurile, melodiile cele mai renumite (de muzica simfonica, electronica, populara, usoara, disco si dintre toate genurile muzicale corecte, sanatoase) sunt  compuse si dirijate de mine. Am facut aceasta inclusiv de la distanta sau in trecut asemeni unui inger. Dar melodiile mele au fost semnate de alti muzicieni. Printre aceste melodii, concerte, melodii din spectacole, opere muzicale compuse, dirijate de mine sunt primele dintre melodiile internationale de succes, de top sau premiate de la radio si televiziuni, internet, muzica filmelor premiata cu Oscar, Globul de Aur si cu premii renumite sau din filmele cele mai renumite inclusiv din filmele Titanic (Oscar)si Gladiatorul (de Oscar), muzica spectacolului Lord of the Dance, muzica lui Luciano Pavarotti, Andreea Boccelli, Angela Gheorghiu, Hose Carreras, Placido Domingo, Enya, Celine Dion, Jean Michel Jarre, Astor Piazzola, Ennio Moricone, muzica celebra, sanatoasa, corecta a majoritatii celor mai mari vedete muzicale, compozitori, artisti de pe glob, cele mai renumite melodii si concerte din toate genurile muzicale corecte, in zeci de mii de melodii. Sunt cel mai iubit muzician de pe planeta din toate timpurile deoarece muzica mea are numarul cel mai mare de fani si de hituri, succese,  de albume vandute. Sunt intr-un cuvant compozitorul si dirijorul a toata muzica de varf, de hit, de succes, de renume a planetei. Cu Celine Dion am vandut muzica mea in cele mai multe albume dintre toti muzicienii, peste 100 milioane. Muzica mea a fost premiata cu locul 1 de cateva ori la  concursul Eurovision, la premiile Oscar, Globul de Aur. Am facut in secret multe altele de renume pe glob, premiate in fiecare din cele 7 arte si in muzica, regie de film dar nu doresc sa ma laud niciodata ci sa prezint cv-ul meu artistic.

RUSayingBooOrBooURNS,,,"&gt; When things can be checked by paper trail, I'd say we're in a pretty good position to spot bullshit.


And bullshit gets spotted all the time.  In ALL these companies.  As I'm sure you know, the internet is awash in forum posts--including right here in this subreddit, on an almost daily basis--by users expressing shock and confusion that their DNA ethnicity tests don't reflect their family's known, documented history.  It's not an isolated problem.


More to the larger point:  The fact that different companies frequently give wildly variant geogenetic analyses to customers should raise serious red flags, scientifically speaking.  The fact that they sometimes use different versions of the Illumina chip, and nearly always sample different SNP arrays and use different reference populations, is clear enough indication that one (or both) of two things is happening:


1.  There's no established and recognized corpus of data to support one company's methodology over the others'; and/or


2.  Each company is out to **sell a product** (which is trivially true), and is playing fast and loose with the science.


I'm convinced that both are true.  What these companies are hawking is Science Lite^tm.  A cheap, Walmart version of population genetics that dazzles the eye and tickles the self-identity fancy.


You asked me for some evidence of what I'm saying.  The source that comes most readily to mind is:


Leslie, et al.  2015.  The fine-scale genetic structure of the British population.  *Nature* 519.


(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4632200/)


The TLDR is that Leslie and colleagues had to use a very advanced genome analysis tool--*one not used by DNA testing companies AT ALL*--to find slight variations between native British people and those throughout mainland Europe.


Some relevant quotes (emphasis mine):


""Human population structure is **reasonably well** understood at **broad scales, for example between and within continents**. Here we investigate structure over much finer scales ...""


""To ensure compatibility between the [People of the British Isles] and continental European samples we restricted attention to autosomal SNPs genotyped in both samples (**~500K SNPs**, see Methods).""  (In other words, they used a regionally variant SNP set that is mostly on the same size order as that of the testing companies'.)


""Consistent with earlier studies of the UK, population structure within the PoBI collection **is very limited**.""


 
""Against this background of very limited structure within the UK, we applied a **recently developed method for detecting fine-scale population structure, fineSTRUCTURE15**, to the PoBI samples, to look for more subtle effects. [...] In contrast to commonly used approaches such as principal components or ADMIXTURE16, fineSTRUCTURE explicitly models the correlation between nearby SNPs, and uses extended multi-marker haplotypes throughout the genome. This substantially increases its power to detect subtle levels of genetic differentiation.""


""Note that it is possible for distinct clusters within the UK to have **very similar ancestry profiles**: e.g. two UK regions could receive similar contributions from a set of European groups (thus similar ancestry profiles) but then evolve separately (leading to different patterns of shared ancestry within and between the regions, and thus to distinct clusters in fineSTRUCTURE).""  (In other words, shared genetic clustering in Great Britain isn't necessarily indicative of specific continenal ancestry.)

...


Anyway, you get the idea.  Bottom line, to be able to tease out the internal British genetic clusters and contrast them to European clusters, Leslie **HAD** to use a state-of-the-art tool that's just not commercially available at retail prices for consumers.  The article is worth reading carefully, in full.

HiddenGun,LGfh2,,"&gt;  Survive is still ultimately harmless, far as I'm concerned.

That depends on what you mean by harmless. Some people just flat out don't buy games with micro transactions because, to them, even buying a game with mtx is supporting that model even if you don't buy anything simply because it's telling publishers ""We'll still buy it"" that and adding mtx is honestly trivial so that adding it doesnt really take away from developing meaning They'll just keep adding it for the potential of a few sales. To them MGSurivive's more radical push towards mtx is something they wouldn't want to support, and may view that it will be harmful for the games industry on a consumer level. Hell we're in a post BF2 world where lootboxes and mtx might be getting legislated. Anyway it depends on how that person feels.

&gt; So by all accounts, if we never got another Metal Gear game again, would it really be ""gone too soon?"" By all accounts, no, it wouldn't. Twenty eight years is enough, most would say.

Im inclined to agree with you. Games, and shows often get worse the more we get. Especially if the game is story driven within one continuity. It's one reason why FF has continued. Outside of some small connections they're all independent of each other allowing the game to take different twists and turns. 
&gt; 
&gt; MGS1 basically rewrites the first two Metal Gear games, because this wasn't a story meant to be made into a saga, hence its' terribly inconsistent continuity. And yet, it still reached its' end.

Ehhh the only thing I remember it changing was Grey Fox's ""death"" in MG2 for the most part, based on memory, those games don't get mentioned too much outside of Big Boss, Grey Fox, and the idea of Outer Heaven I believe. I could be remembering however. 
&gt; 
&gt; If it was Survive over ""Metal Gear: The Remake,"" or ""Metal Gear Solid 6: This Time, You're Really Big Boss, We Swear!,"" then, sure, it'd be very easy to understand the outrage. Heck, if a Metal Gear 1 remake was scrapped in favor of Survive, I'd probably be saying, ""fuck this game"" out of pure principle.
&gt; 
&gt; But that wasn't the case.

Yeah, but here's the thing. How many people wanted MGSurvive and how many people wanted the MSX/PS games remade in the Fox Engine. Hell one of the things after MGSV launched was people wanted Konami to remake those games. Instead, based on sales, and I know some people are simply not buying it because of Konami, We got a game that just simply only exists to follow old design trends. Is it still a fun game? yeah, but it's clearly trying to follow a trend here. Konami also knows people want a remake, people also want a port of the HD collection + 4 but I digress. Look at the FF7 Remake and all the attention that got it could have been a gesture of good will and having the next game after the Konami break up be a remake, most likely a damn good one, would soften the public to more MGS games from Konami. I'm convinced had survive been made after a good remake the negative press would be far less, although the criticisms would still be there. Anyway this of course doesn't counter your point since theres no real information, outside of sales but even that's somewhat unreliable but this more of a ""Think about it like this"" sorta deal"" if that makes sense. 

&gt; People can view Survive as cynical, mediocre, a cash grab all they want, and if that's how they feel, then that's fine! We all have opinions, and we'll all view things very differently, there's nothing wrong with that. But whatever you wanna call it, that still don't change the fact that its' existence doesn't hurt anything, not even Metal Gear.

It's existence? no but supporting it could hurt other things. Namely the business practices of other Konami games. But I touched on that on my first point. 

&gt; To go off of gameranx's point about Survive's hollow nature and microtransactions, I'd counter by saying where was any of this outrage ten years ago when MGO2 came out? I've seen people say that it came free with MGS4, but it didn't really. Its' basic starter pack came free with MGS4. Five maps; U.U., M.M., B.B., A.A., G.G., came free. But to play Survival? You'd need an expansion pack. To play with everyone else on all the ten additional levels and to get some new gear, you'd need to buy all the expansion packs. In order to play as a different character, you'd have to either delete your preexisting one with all the stuff you've earned and XP, or just purchase a second one for $6.99. And you could purchase upwards of seven additional characters. I know because I did for video purposes and nothing else. (I'm old, and I'm okay spending money for making short videos.)

MGO2 wasn't a standalone game, in the Americas and EU  at least, it was in Japan, so for 60 dollars we got the main story of the game, arguably what most people wanted, and than the online which grew to have a cult following. Now the reason why I feel like the outrage wasn't there is that it simply wasn't the main star of the show. It was there and it was good. But compare MGO2 to MGSurvive. Everyone was focused on the story and people simply ignored the MP after the first initial review, and some stories when the expansions came out. Paying for a character was dumb, the DLC was fine since it was just standard DLC, similar to the CoD Map packs. codecs were kinda dumb but again none of this was held under ""Survive coins"" or ""MB coins"" it was dumb but it was just considered cheap dlc. This was also 2008 in which DLC didn't spiral out of control and so naturally reception is gonna be different in 2018. We've seen how perverted the idea of DLC has became but in 2008 it was just ""eh kinda cool"" it's kinda unfair to compare the reactions of a 2008 audience to a 2018 audience especially in a field that develops as quickly as this. Eventually the Gene, Meme and Scene DLC was sold for like 20 dollars, a good price when you consider what a CoD mappack got you. This is also ignoring that MGO2 did feel unique from the other shooters. It has that metal gear feel even when the meta evolved to HS only. You could still sneak, and use cardboard boxes to try and get the drop on your enemy. Than agian I am also very biased towards MGO2 so you can ignore my last couple of sentences. 

Side note: did you end up making any MGO2 Machinmas? Those were honestly pretty great.
&gt; And then what happened? MGO2 shut down four years later, despite there being a planned fourth expansion pack which never happened; even if the maps were revealed, and odds are good, the uniques probably would've been Big Boss and Big Mama. (that last part is entirely conjecture, but the three additional maps that never made it into SENSE are on YouTube.) And despite the fact that the servers supposedly had a ten year plan. No matter how much money you spent on characters, DLC, radio packs, or whatever, all that money went down the drain. It wasn't just we paid $65 for MGS4 and MGO2, and eventually were just left with MGS4. We paid $65 for MGS4 and the starter pack for MGO2, and some of us paid a lot more for the full MGO2 experience, and ultimately, it was a rental with an expiration date.
Oh thank christ I'm not the only one who remembers that ""10 year plan"" I've looked for that article or piece of media do you happen to remember where that was said? Cause Google doesn't wanna help. I do agree that MGO2 closing, after 4 years, was absurd. Sure it didn't have the best numbers but it was still sizable given the fact it was a niche online game. At least it's back now. And yeah those Maps were added to the MGO2 Arcade game iirc. It was released only in japan and had The Arsenal Gear zone, Act 5. Also alot of games that have added online componetns get shut down. Now unless it's a game like CoD where it's primarily Multiplayer I don't feel my MGS4 disc lost value when the servers went under. THis is gonna be true of more and more MP games it's just the nature of how the game was programmed. If there was a backup where it didn't need to access Servers, matchmaking or otherwise, it would be good but publishers don't really think about preservation of media.
&gt; And yet, there was zero outrage for MGO2. None whatsoever. It was every bit a ""cash grab"" as Survive is, and yet, people loved it and praised it. It never received an ounce of criticism for its' microtransactions, despite most gaming sites seeming to be completely indifferent towards its' exisetence. 

But you didn't buy MGO2 standalone. This comparison would be better if Survive came with MGSV as the online version.  But you're not wrong in saying it was a cash grab, but so was any tacked on MP back in the late 2000's. Companies started doing that so people wouldn't resell their games and could provide online content, which was easier than story missions. Also I wouldn't say people loved it and praised it. It had a cult following for sure but overall consenus, based on game review sites, were it was kinda okay. Also I think you might be getting confused mtx is only considered a mtx when theres an alternative currency. I see what you're trying to say but the Map packs would just be considered DLC, same with codec and character slots. It was still bad but not necessarily a mtx
&gt; So, for me personally, I find it painfully hypocritical that we have room for games like MGO2, but none for Survive, when, far as I'm concerned, they're both on par with one another, and the only difference, far as I can see, is that one at least had a fairly decent if mixed single player, and the other had a lot of t-bagging.

But MGO2 was bundled with MGS4. It also existed in a prior format as MGO1 on MGS3, and that sever shut down ever faster. Being a multiplayer component isn't necessarily a spin off. Not to mention the game still followed the base mechanics of MGS4. I feel the best description is when it's standalone its sold seperately, and that was only Japan. If you bought MGO2 standalone than yeah but im guessing you got it with MGS4, based on how your arguing.

Otesánek is a Czech fairy tale created by Karel Jaromír Erben which tells the story of a fearsome and constantly hungry, living log of wood. In the story there are elements of narrative that are similar to more famous fairy tales such as The Adventures of Pinocchio and Little Red Riding Hood; despite this, the themes present in Otesánek appear nonetheless to be quite different from most other European fairy tales, with a particularly ambiguous moral which leaves a lot of room to subjective interpretation.

Kr1tya3,,,"Britain is now running a current budget surplus as tax revenues cover all day to day spending, for the first full year since 2001.


This surplus, which excludes capital investment by the Government, came in at £3.8bn for 2017, the Office for National Statistics said.


George Osborne set this as a target in 2010 and hoped to achieve it two years earlier in 2015.


More good news is expected later this month as the Office for Budget Responsibility is set to upgrade its growth forecasts, giving the Chancellor a windfall of extra tax revenues.


The International Monetary Fund said Britain set an example for other countries to follow in slashing the deficit by cutting public spending, rather than raising taxes.


“Following the financial crisis, the two countries that adopted spending-based austerity and did better than the rest of the sample were Ireland and the UK,” the IMF report said.


“The result: growth in the United Kingdom was higher than the European average.”


It is increasingly important that other countries copy this approach, the IMF said, as Governments around the world have racked up too much debt which will harm growth and stifle productivity when interest rates rise.


The surge in global growth gives countries the perfect opportunity to cut their debt burdens - and they should do it by cutting spending rather than by raising taxes, before the economy slows down again and the debt burden becomes tougher to bear.


“Countries take a smaller hit to growth if they cut spending - including for entitlement programs - than if they raise taxes. In fact, the latter can be self-defeating, leading to even higher debt and lower growth,” said Camilla Lund Andersen in the IMF’s Finance and Development report.


“Governments should use the current upswing to put their house in order. And while each country must chart its own course, the global recovery presents a rare opportunity - rising interest rates will soon make it harder to refinance and service debt.”


Advanced economies have an average government debt of 104pc of GDP, which is close to the highest levels seen since the Second World War.


Political momentum behind deficit reduction has waned in many countries, as years of fiscal restraint led to policy fatigue and the economic recovery made debt reduction appear less important.


But the IMF warns that upbeat assessments of the global economy “ignore debt levels that remain close to historic highs and the inevitable end of the cyclical upswing”.


“Servicing debt will become a major burden,” it warns.


Spending cuts have been unpopular in some instances, but a new study from economists Alberto Alesina, Carlo Favero, and Francesco Giavazzi indicates they are less damaging than tax rises.


“Our conclusion runs against the basic Keynesian message, which implies that spending cuts are more recessionary than tax increases,” the trio found.


“On the contrary, our study confirms that expenditure-based plans generally were less harmful to growth than tax-based plans.”


Studying a range of deficit-cutting programmes, the economists found spending cuts of 1pc of GDP hit economic growth by 0.5 percentage points relative to the trend rate of growth, with the dent put in growth lasting for less than two years.


If this is done at a time of economic growth it has no negative impact, so the economy grows even at a time of austerity.


By contrast plans based on tax hikes resulted in a two percentage point fall in GDP relative to its previous path.


“This large recessionary effect tends to last several years,” they said.


This also indicates Britain did the right thing after 2010 by cutting spending to keep the public finances in line.",True,0,1519975455,,False,0,dv27jx1,True,t3_81cjsd,False,t3_81cjsd,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/81cjsd/back_in_black_uk_in_current_budget_surplus_as_imf/dv27jx1/,1524730152,14,True,False,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,public,

Mana drain is a good comparison Target for that , presale 70€/77$ and presale Stock was around 90 copies .
Now a few month later , the IMA copy has over 500 Listings and starts as low as 33€/35$ .

yodatsracist,,,"Cool actually *hasn’t* been cycled through in the same way as the other examples you give. Check out /u/sunagainstgold’s answer in /r/askhistorians:

 * [Is there any reason why ""cool"" has had such a cultural sticking power while other slang terms have frequently come and gone?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7ptwel/is_there_any_reason_why_cool_has_had_such_a/dsk9fps/)

This is speculative  but I  wonder, though, if these cycles of words don’t have to do with *sub*cultures, particularly distinct youth-based and/or music-based subcultures, that I’m not sure existed in the same way historically before the era of mass production and mass communication. These subcultures have their own linguistic, sartorial, and other cultural norms that differentiate insiders in-the-know from what we might call, well, “uncool” outsiders. These mass production-disseminated youth subcultures, as far as I know, go at least as far back as books and printed material. I know that Goethe’s *The Sorrows of Young Werther* influenced the emerging capital-R Romantic subculture. These sorts of youth movements obviously took off with music based subcultures once albums and radios become widely available, though in America these often build on the African-American subculture/culture which developed along separate lines in America due to Blacks’ pariah status until at least the 60’s. Arguably, the earlier European Romantic movement tried to build off another pariah group, the Rroma, which is why cool downtown distincts are called “Bohemian” even today. Here’s etymonline explain (notice the spread through mass produced books and plays):

&gt;The French used *bohemién* since 15c. to also mean ""Gypsy."" The Roma were wrongly believed to have come from there, perhaps because their first appearance in Western Europe may have been immediately from Bohemia, or because they were confused with the 15c. Bohemian Hussite heretics, who were driven from their country about that time.

&gt;The transferred sense, in reference to unconventional living, is attested in French by 1834 and was popularized by Henri Murger's stories from the late 1840s later collected as ""*Scenes de la Vie de Boheme*"" (the basis of Puccini's ""*La Bohème*""). It appears in English 1848 in Thackary's ""*Vanity Fair.*""

The Romantics, in creating the boundaries of cool-before-it-was-“cool”, explicitly tried to draw on the existing Rroma culture, one of the few local “Others” in Europe. 

This isn’t quite about subcultural linguistic trends, but it is about linguistic trends that I think can only be talked about in terms of mass-produced culture. There’s this a great scene in Balzac’s *Père Goriot* where they  make fun of language trends which I assume are tied to mass production (the mass audience comes in this period from mass printing), but may not be (Sun may be able to say if medieval linguistic trends and fashions existed like that). The following scene takes place in a boarding house called Maison Vauquer, where the titular “Father Goriot” and main character Eugene both live:

&gt;The boarders dropped in one after another, interchanging greetings and the empty jokes that certain classes of Parisians regard as humorous and witty. Dullness is their prevailing ingredient, and the whole point consists in mispronouncing a word or in a gesture. This kind of argot is always changing. The essence of the jest consists in 
some catchword suggested by a political event, an incident in the police courts, a street song, or a bit of burlesque at some theater, and forgotten in a month. Anything and everything serves to keep up a game of battledore and shuttlecock with words and ideas. The diorama, a recent invention, which carried an optical illusion a degree further than panoramas, had given rise to a mania among art students for ending every word with rama. The Maison Vauquer 
had caught the infection from a young artist among the 
boarders. 

&gt;""Well, Monsieur-r-r Poiret,"" said the employee from the 
Museum, ""how is your health-orama ?"" Then, without waiting for an answer, he turned to Mme. Couture and Victorine with a ""Ladies, you seem melancholy."" 

&gt;""Is dinner ready?"" cried Horace Bianchon, a medical student, and a friend of Rastignac's; ""my stomach is sinking usque ad taiones [I’m looking at a OCR scanned copy and I think the character recognition failed here]."" 

&gt;""There is an uncommon frozerama outside !"" said Vautrin. ""Make room there. Father Goriot! Confound it! your foot covers the whole front of the stove."" 

&gt;""Illustrious M. Vautrin,"" put in Bianchon, ""why do you say frozerama? It is incorrect; it should be frozenrama."" 

&gt;""No, it shouldn't,"" said the official from the museum; ""frozerama is right by the same rule that you say 'My feet are froze.'"" [...]

&gt;""Aha! here is a magnificent soupe-au-rama,"" cried Poiret as Christophe came in bearing the soup with cautious heed. 

&gt;""I beg your pardon, sir,"" said Mme. Vauquer; ""it is soup aux choux."" [...]

&gt; ""Did any one notice the fog this morning?"" asked the official. 

&gt;""It was a frantic fog,"" said Bianchon, ""a fog unparalleled, doleful, melancholy, sea-green, asthmatical— a Goriot of a fog!"" 

&gt;""A Goriorama,"" said the art student, ""because you couldn't see a thing in it.""

I am happy that this article shocked you enough to run out of arguments and fall straight to the leftist level of ad hominem. It is a good news that no-one here had any factual argument against this, showing that your answer is emotional and not rational. But also showing the feminine mindset that has been programmed in your brain. Anyway. You call me incel, and you are so far from reality. I know PUAs well, very well. I read Neil Strauss, Vox, Chateau, watched Tyler, etc. I hanged out with dozens of so called PUAs and MGTOW. Yet, 99% of them are single, sad, and without children. Factually, if we call evolution to remove the weaks, then these people are part of it. That is strange, right? Of course you can downvote me as a sign of feminine emotional reaction, but that won't change facts. Feminism has destroyed the family unit, yes. The natural order of things is the family, and having children. Your child can't be healthy without his father at home, that is also a scientific fact. Listen to Molyneux, he treated very well the subject. PUAs and MGTOW are just the opposite side of the same coin that is called feminism. It is a female ideology, not a manly one. It is a left ideology, not a right one. And it is a liberal ideology, not a conservative one. It is no surprise that inside groups like RSD you find many immigrants and leftists. Now, let's push it further. In a near future, as Vox already believes, the mass immigration in the us and europe will lead to war. Muslims do make children, and a lot. How do you planned fighting if your focus is to pick-up women? Why would you even fight if you think that family and having children doesn't matter? And if we already all old without children, who's gonna fight for our genes, our culture? These questions, you ain't gonna answer your ""own way"", but collectively. You won't be able to defend yourself if we don't control our women. Finally, I see someone saying that all of that ain't conspiracy. Again, how could you be so much in denial and uninformed?

Farming payments are one recent example of this.

UnchainedMundane,,,"How about this one:

 The fact that so many books still name the Beatles as ""the greatest or most significant or most influential"" rock band ever only tells you how far rock music still is from becoming a serious art. Jazz critics have long recognized that the greatest jazz musicians of all times are Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Classical critics rank the highly controversial Beethoven over classical musicians who were highly popular in courts around Europe. Rock critics are still blinded by commercial success. The Beatles sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. Jazz critics grow up listening to a lot of jazz music of the past, classical critics grow up listening to a lot of classical music of the past. Rock critics are often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that the Beatles did anything worthy of being saved.

potpan0,," ❌ 🙏 ❌ No Gods, No Masters ❌ 👑 ❌","&gt; why race exists is because that variance is happening in distinctly different ways and has a shape particular to that race.

That isn't why race exists. Race is a social construct. This means what we consider as different 'races' isn't particularly scientific or biological, it's to do with broader social factors. A good way to show this is to look at how people have viewed the 'white' race in different ways. In early 20th century America, people from Ireland, Italy, Spain and Eastern Europe were not viewed as being as 'white' as people from countries such as Germany and England. Similarly, in Nazi Germany 'Aryan' was a term largely reserved for 'Germanic' people. However, today, we view basically everyone in Europe, from Ireland to Spain to Sweden to Russia, as 'white'. And this shows that our considerations of race are not particularly scientifically grounded, they are a social construct.

OSCAR G.

(Nervous/Murk-Miami)



If you were to get out a map and track the history of house music with endless lines sprouting from New York, Chicago and Detroit to points all over the world you’d have to make a big, red circle around Miami, Florida, and start drawing.



Miami was never ground zero to a full-fledged subcultural movement. But it is where Oscar Gaetan, better known as Oscar G, has lived every day of his life. And that fact alone makes it a hub on the global underground.

An award-winning songwriter, producer, and DJ, Oscar is one of dance music’s brightest and most enduring stars. As part of seminal production teams Liberty City, Murk, and Funky Green Dogs, he boasts hits, Billboard chart-toppers as well as underground smashes in every decade, every trend, and every market. Some Lovin ,Fired Up, and Dark Beat are more than just tracks: They are moments, shared by clubbers worldwide. They’re the kind of moments Oscar still creates at Space Miami, his hometown superclub, where he’s been a resident DJ for a staggering eight years coming full circle after a globetrotting career.



Oscar and longtime friend and production partner Ralph Falcon grew up in a Miami enlivened by the fresh spirit of hip-hop. ?Break dancing, graffiti and the music that went along with it: That’s really what got me into DJ-ing in the first place, he says. By the age of 12, he was already spinning at school dances.



Oscar and Ralph started working together at the end of high school, blending the sounds of their youth with the beginnings of house, like Ten City and Blaze; and the darker Euro bands of the time, like Depeche Mode and New Order. “We were always big on doing our own sound, with our own feeling and vibe in every aspect of it; from the way we mixed things to the sounds we chose” says Oscar. “I remember being obsessed with that for years, and then people started to listen”.



The early years bore some of the work for which they’re still best known, like often imitated, never duplicated vocals Some Lovin, If You Really Love Someone, and Reach For Me (Tribal). Upon their release in 1993, the pair became instant superstars. “Europe kind of grabbed us” says Oscar, so they spent a good amount of time touring overseas, eventually visiting every major and minor outpost of the global dance scene, including Zouk Singapore, Ministry Of Sound London, and Stereo Montreal.



Fired Up! (Twisted), their biggest hit ever, followed in 1996. It topped the Billboard Dance chart, and even cracked the Top 100, peaking at No. 80. They would go on to remix countless major pop artists, from Madonna to Cher to Donna Summer; and appear on mainstream outlets like MTV and Top Of The Pops. The boys also cut two complete Funky Green Dogs albums for major label MCA, Star (1999) and Super California (2001). But their own measures of success were still decidedly underground: “Once Junior Vasquez played our records at Sound Factory [in New York], we felt like we could retire, and at that point we were like 20” says Oscar.



In March 2000, Space opened in downtown Miami with Oscar as the Saturday night resident, just as the world was paying its annual visit for Winter Music Conference. The club with its cavernous main room, pummeling German sound system and nitrogen blasts was the talk of dance world, and the legend of Oscar’s residency began to grow.



The year 2003 was a big one. Oscar released the Live @ Space (Star 69) compilation, and won the Club World Award for Best Resident DJ (which he won again in 2007). Murk set a new Billboard Dance chart record, with five No. 1's in a single year: Four singles from their self-titled artist album on Tommy Boy Records, and Dark Beat (Twisted), tribal house’s first real vocal anthem, which found its way from dance floors onto mainstream radio. “We came up with Dark Beat in about 15 minutes. Whenever things come that quickly, you know there’s something to them” says Oscar. “But we didn’t think radio or anthem; we were thinking more like, Oh man, Danny Tenaglia’s gonna be all over this!”



In 2006, Oscar became one of Pacha New York’s only non-NY-based monthly residents, strengthening his bond with his home-away-from-home, and its rich dance history. He released a second installment in the Space series in 2007, starting new relationships with Nervous Records in the U.S. and CR2 in the U.K. CR2 also snapped up the Murk catalog, and commissioned new remixes of the classic tracks, including Paul Woolford’s takes on If You Really Love Someone and Reach For Me. And in 2008, after nearly two decades making music, Oscar released his first solo album, Innov8 (Nervous).



Even though his passion for music creation is undeniable, it’s in his DJ booth where Oscar feels most at home: Both at Space, and at his regular club dates across North and Latin America each weekend. “On the music side, I’ve felt pretty energized lately, because the changes in the industry really enable you to be a lot more experimental and take more chances” he says. “But DJ-ing to me always comes first: I really believe in it as an art form. Having a residency like Space, with a regular crowd, it’s the ultimate.”

MrJohz,,"Right wing, but only by Corbyn's standards","For free! One of them literally said the words ""for free"", and the other described the ID card as something temporary you'd get in the post for each election. Both completely acknowledged that this is basically a non-issue, and offered their suggestions more as reassurances than as solutions for a major national problem.

I recognise that Republicans in the US have traditionally used voter ID as a dogwhistle tactic to discriminate against poorer people who can't afford ID, or wouldn't know how to get hold of it. There are certainly issues with voter ID schemes. However, there are good reasons for ID cards as well. Many Europeans don't need to get passports if they travel solely within the EU, making holidays cheaper and more affordable for poorer folk. You also avoid some situations where proof of address is the only viable option for proof of identity. An ID card system could potentially make it easier for people without permanent addresses to take part in normal activities.

Rkhighlight,Globalisierungsgewinner,Globalisierungsgewinner,"&gt;Egal ob es die „kleinen Leute“ sind, oder Menschen, denen es ökonomisch noch gut geht, die sich aber Sorgen über die Zukunft machen – sie wurden weniger gehört und in letzter Zeit immer mehr moralisch von einer tonangebenden akademischen Klasse abgewertet. Der von dieser Klasse getragene kosmopolitische Liberalismus ist sowohl im Merkel-Flügel der Union, als auch unter vielen Funktionären der SPD und der Grünen sowie im Kipping-Flügel der Linkspartei hegemonial geworden. Auch im Journalismus ist er sehr verbreitet.

Dies, dies so sehr. Auch wenn ich schon etliche Mal diesen Artikel empfohlen habe, kann ich nicht oft genug auf [""die globale Klasse""](https://m.tagesspiegel.de/politik/die-globale-klasse-eine-andere-welt-ist-moeglich-aber-als-drohung/14737914.html) verweisen: 

&gt;Der sich aufspannende globale Raum habe den Aufstieg dieser neuen Klasse ermöglicht. Die „globale Klasse“ ist es, die für sich die Chancen der Globalisierung entdeckt und sie zu ihrer Produktivkraft gemacht hat: den Unterschied. Damit meinte er schon damals nicht nur den kapitalistischen Großunternehmer, der seine Produktion nach Asien verlagert, sondern auch den Jogalehrer oder das chinesische Familienrestaurant in Bottrop.

[...]

&gt;Es gibt heute eine globalisierte Klasse der Informationsarbeiter, der die meisten von uns angehören und die viel homogener und mächtiger ist, als sie denkt. Es sind gut gebildete, tendenziell eher junge Menschen, die sich kulturell zunehmend global orientieren, die die ""New York Times"" lesen statt die Tagesschau zu sehen, die viele ausländische Freunde und viele Freunde im Ausland haben, die viel reisen, aber nicht unbedingt, um in den Urlaub zu fahren. **Es ist eine Klasse, die fast ausschließlich in Großstädten lebt, die so flüssig Englisch spricht wie ihre Muttersprache, für die Europa kein abstraktes Etwas ist, sondern eine gelebte Realität, wenn sie zum Jobwechsel von Madrid nach Stockholm zieht.**

[...]

&gt;Eine wachsende Gruppe global orientierter Menschen gibt es in jedem Land dieser Erd, und sie ist gut vernetzt. **Diese neue globalisierte Klasse sitzt in den Medien, in den StartUps und NGOs, in den Parteien, und weil sie die Informationen kontrolliert („liberal media“, „Lügenpresse“), gibt sie überall kulturell und politisch den Takt vor. Das heißt nicht, dass sie politisch homogen im eigentlichen Sinne ist – zumindest empfindet sie sich nicht so – sie ist zum Beispiel in Deutschland fast im gesamten Parteienspektrum zu finden, in der CDU, SPD, LINKE, GRÜNE, FDP.** Diese Klasse entspringt dem Bürgertum, aber hat sich von ihm emanzipiert.

[...]

&gt;Die Machtverschiebung ging im Stillen vor sich. Irgendwann begann sich der progressivere Teil des Bürgertums sozial enger mit seinesgleichen über Ländergrenzen hinweg zu vernetzen und kulturell zu orientieren. Die globale Klasse entstand und hat den kulturellen Wandel der Globalisierung beschleunigt. Globale Standards nicht nur in der Wirtschaft, sondern auch in Politik, Kultur und Moral. **Die progressiven, zunehmend global Orientierten haben die anderen einfach abgehängt. Aber weil sie anders herrscht und weil sie sich dabei mit der Gesellschaft selbst verwechselt, merkt sie es nicht mal.** Sie hat keine Gewalt auf ihrer Seite, und die meisten haben noch nicht einmal wahnsinnig viel Geld.

[...] 

&gt;**Und das merken die anderen, die kulturell Abgehängten.** Sie merken, dass uns ihre Welt zu klein geworden ist, dass wir uns moralisch überlegen fühlen und dass wir nach Größerem streben. **Vor allem merken sie, dass wir dabei erfolgreich sind, dass wir auf diesem Weg die Standards definieren, die nach und nach auch an sie selbst angelegt werden.** Ökologische, antirassistische, antisexistische Standards. Politisch korrekte Standards eben. Und die Standards, die dabei entwertet und verdrängt werden, kamen mal aus dem Bürgertum, aus einer Zeit, als sie noch das Sagen hatten. Es ist eine kulturelle Gentrifizierung.

&gt;Auf magische Weise hat das Bürgertum trotz Grundbesitz, privater Krankenvorsorge und leitender Angestelltenfunktion die Deutungshoheit verloren. „Take Back Control“, der Slogan der Brexiter ist der eigentliche Schlachtruf all der neurechten Bewegungen. **Es gibt gerade im Bürgertum das Gefühl des Kontrollverlusts. Gemeint damit ist der Verlust der kulturellen Hegemonie, der als nationale „Souveränität“ erinnert wird.** Englische Standards wurden in England bestimmt, Deutsche in Deutschland, amerikanische in den USA. Die globale Klasse bringt alles durcheinander!

[...]

&gt;**Und weil man gegen die globale Klasse nicht moralisch und argumentativ gewinnen kann, bleibt der alternativen Rechten nur noch, jede Moral und jedes Argument zu verweigern.** Trump und Brexit und die Rehabilitation von „Völkisch“ sind argumentative und moralische Pflastersteine in unsere Vitrinen. **Sie sind der internationale Aufstand gegen die kulturelle Hegemonie der globalen Klasse.**

Gerade der Erfolg der AfD, die nunmal nicht nur oder gar überwiegend aus wirtschaftlich Abgehängten besteht, bestätigt die These, dass es sich hauptsächlich um sozio-kulturelle und nicht sozio-ökonomische Probleme handelt. Der Ruf nach Lügenpresse, Altparteien und Linksgrünversifft wird immer als ""wer rechts außen steht, für den ist nunmal alles links"" abgetan. Doch wir merken oft nicht, wie homogen wir sind, da es nicht unserer Binnenwahrnehmung entspricht. Humanismus, EU, Minderheitenschutz und Fortschritt sind alles progressive Werte, die gar nicht mehr hinterfragt wurden, weil sie als selbstverständlich galten. Dabei gibt es aber einen überraschen großen Teil der Gesellschaft, die einige dieser Werte einfach nicht teilt.

MrJohz,,"Right wing, but only by Corbyn's standards","One person literally stated that it is a non-issue.

&gt; This seems like a non-issue though.

And the other person said they didn't believe voter fraud had a meaningful impact on elections.

&gt;  If there was voter fraud on any scale that meaningfully affected elections, however, I think it would be noticed more.

And again, both people suggested entirely free ID cards.  Now sure, this could be changed, but so can literally everything about our country, including arbitrarily electing some random dictator who will force us all to work in his spice mines.  This seems unlikely, however.  Many European countries manage to require ID to vote without it seeming to have huge impacts on voter enfranchisement.  Germany, for example, has mandatory IDs, and France requires everyone to have some form of ID, although it doesn't mandate which form of ID they use.

There are clear benefits for ID cards, particularly if they're offered free for all citizens, as in both suggestions.  As I explained, they could well be used to help poorer or less enfranchised people by providing them with an identity document that they don't need to pay for at all.  That is fairly difficult to come by!

&gt; Just a coincidence that they all are, then?

delegeferanda,,,"&gt; At du velger å overse dette og komme med en patetisk unnskyldning om at jeg er ""følelsesladet"" beviser

Her er du på luggeføre igjen, du må skille mellom hva som åpenbart er useriøse kommentarer og hva som ikke er det, noe jeg påpekte klart. Imidlertid ser man enda klarere hvor sensitivt tema dette er for deg.

&gt; Norge vil alltid inneha et demokratisk underskudd enten vi forblir utenfor eller velger å innlemme oss gjennom det enkle faktum at vi utgjør en veldig liten representativ del av Europas befolkning. Og så lenge vi forblir utenfor gjelder ikke uunngåelige motargumentet du vil komme med ""at det er slik det fungerer i et demokrati"". Vi er ikke en del av det demokratiet og å velge å bli med er netto økonomisk tap for Norge og alle de som bor her nettopp av den grunn.

Her har du noen alvorlige mangler med innsikten din i EU-systemet. Å tro at befolkningstallet, representativiteten, vil stikke kjepper i hjulet for beslutningsdyktigheten - et medlemskap vil gi - er virvar. Lovgivningen er institusjonalisert helt annerledes enn det vi er kjent med fra norsk forfatningsrett, herunder vil det viktigste lovgivningsorganet, Det eurpeiske unions råd, ikke hensynta befolkningstall men vektlegge stater ekvivalent. Det er heller bare i de siste året at Parlamentet har fått større lovgiverrolle, og heller ikke der er det tale om normal representativitet. Det nevnte avstedkommer en verdig lovgiverrolle for Norge, ikke det bilde du fortegner.

&gt; Derfor burde vi komme oss ut av EØS så fort som mulig.

Helt riktig at vi kommer oss ut av den demokratiske ubalansen, men å melde seg ut av EØS uten en avledet avtale er det samme som å sette Norge i en tidsmaskin sannsynligvis minst 10 år tilbake i tid (grunnet den vektige og moderne sekundærlovgivningen) - og restaureringsprosessen vil være uforholdsmessig belastende for norsk økonomi. Og resultatet? Vi står utenfor Europas indre marked - hvor ingen særskilt endring skjer med jordbruks- og fiskeripolitikken.

Og la oss ikke glemme noe av det viktigste!
Folkeavstemning er overhodet ikke institusjonalisert, som du nesten gir inntrykk av at det er - vi har i kraft av folkesuvereniteten bestemt at vi har et representativt demokrati - ikke direkte som du legger føringer an til må være avgjørende. NEI - faktisk talt er de legitimt valgte stortingsrepresentantene som velger om vi skal være med i EU. 

""Men det må jo legge adekvate føringer på hvilke avtaler vi skal slutte"". 

**Feil igjen!** EØS innebærer reell og formell (ESA) suverenitetsavståelse, og jeg kan ikke huske det norske folk ble spurt.

dietderpsy,,,"Look at Ireland for the answer to this, gangs have always existed in Ireland but you can see the evolution.

In the past gangs were mostly local street gangs who would fight with fists and sometimes weapons, it was mostly beat downs and slashings, there were rarely fatal encounters, these guys though would beat up a lot on ordinary people so they were a big problem for society.

Then you had the top level criminal gangs who were hardened criminals, they robbed banks and did other high grade robberies, they were always a lot more violent, they maimed but rarely did they kill. Even these guys didn't have very many guns.

When the IRA broke up a lot of their guns were sold to the top level criminal gangs, now you saw a lot of armed robberies on armoured cars, the Government then used Tier 1 Special Forces to guard the armoured cars and that wasn't much of a problem anymore.

When drugs became big on the scene the top level criminals became hyper aggressive, similar to the drug cartels in South America.They starting arming themselves with heavier weapons from Europe,and they started pitched gun battles with each other on the streets,something that just didn't happen in Ireland.

The thing is Ireland has very strict gun control, most of our cops don't even carry, so in order to get a gun, even a 9mm, you need serious connections, it's like buying a cruise missile, the average thug doesn't have a gun, so gun crime very rarely ever affects the public. It's only really the top level guys, think major organised crime syndicates.

Now If you ask some of the original top level guys what changed on the scene, they will tell you drugs. Of course though in America it is different, there is what I call a gun saturation, guns are everywhere, there are too easy to get a hold of, the average street thug can be armed, now it affects the public more. 

Easy access to weapons is a major problem, you can arm yourself but you are not equal, you don't set out that day to steal or kill, the criminal does, if he lives in an armed society he won't take the chance and hold you up, he is going to kill you, it doesn't seem logical, why would he risk a life sentence for a robbery but these low level guys are stupid or high, that makes them very dangerous.

I think legalizing certain drugs will reduce the aggression, legalizing marijuana and psychedelics will generally be harmless, legalizing cocaine, opium or meth will be different, addicts of such drugs don't know when to stop, they can spend their entire wages on drugs and they will still go out and rob people to get more.

The supply side will be greatly affected at the local level, the top level criminals will simply enter into the legal drug trade and lose a percentage, these guys are business cartels who operate multiple business ventures, to make a real impact on them you need to 'mark them' and then assassinate every single one of them, in single very large operations, of course these organisations get replaced but you just keep flattening them.

I've seen a lot of Foreign media, like BBC, criticizing about Chinese rulings, laws, international actions, but they never questioned about the GDP growth of China. according to your link, the annual growth rate of GDP of china is 6.9%, have you learned about macroeconomics that it was abnormal-even too high. Are you questioning your source credibility in your link?

you mentioned that democracy is must for if the next president is a fool, he will devastate the country. That's COMPLETLEY true. However, Chinese folks, to some extent, even don't care about democracy. Indians, however, was cultivated to be ""democratic"" since they were much more affected by Europeans, like British colonizers. But in Chinese, the folks just want a good leader no matter in which form. In 20th century, they even don't know what is democracy.

Americans did not do that? You are implying that there is no racists in America towards China (as lots of Chinese discriminate Americans too)? So how can you explain in some websites I see words like F**K Chinese out? If you want I can give you links, though I believe 
it's a common fact that there's still some people are racists in America. I'm hoping you are not intentionally beautifying them.

I know that in this part our history is wrong (even a normal person can know that), but I do not know the fact either. As you said in Wiki, there's controversy because British colonizers previously states the region to India, but the Chinese gov refutes to acknowledge this behavior, known as McMahon Line. Indians never invades anyone, but what about the Doklam ( I almost read everything on wiki since you think its authoratative, but the condition is that Indian gov is interfering the Bhutan gov.

Your Gamertag: MaskoBlackfyre
Your country/time zone: Croatia, EU (CET, GMT +1)
When do you usually play (include times and time zone):

During the week I usually play after work, between 6 pm and 11 pm (CET)
Over the weekend I play more often and whenever I feel like it, because I don't work Saturday and Sunday

Tell us a bit about yourself (ex: experience in Destiny, how many characters, Light Levels, anything else):

I'm a Destiny veteran. Started mid-The Dark Below, clocked over 2000 hours by the time D2 launched.
I have all 3 characters up to 400 light in D1, with a Grimoire Score of 5525.
I went flawless in all eras of the game and even gave a Scarab emblem (if anyone actually cares about that), but I never enjoyed playing Trials due to never having an steady team interested in learning and growing as a team and as individual players.

In D2 I have only one character, my Titan, at 334 (missing a 335 kinetic).
IRL I'm in my 30's, working as a Software Engineer.

What are you looking for in a clan (for example: PvE, PvP, any special criteria):

I'd like to find a European clan with people similar to myself, employed, at least in their mid-to-late 20's and above.
I have nothing against American players, but we're not in the same time-zone and after many years of being in an american clan, I'm sick and tired of playing until 4 am because I'm the only European so I'm the one that needs to adjust.
Similarly, with all do respect, I don't have a lot in common with teenagers. We may like the same game, but I'm no jaded and rash to pass judgement on a game just because I don't agree with all the developer decisions.
I like Destiny and I like Destiny 2 and I'm fed up with listening about how ""the game used to be good, now it's trash"".

Lastly, a bit about me as a player. I like PVE over PVP in both Destiny games. I'm decent but not great in PVP, but I'm pretty good at PVE. I like soloing stuff, but I'd much rather have a well coordinated and knowledgeable team to play with.
I'm not as good as Esoterikk (that man is has truly become Legend), but I'm the same type of player.

Stenny007,,,"Dutch companies get to sit at the table with the Dutch ministry of finance like all other large complex companies. Shell, Unilever, Aegon, Phillips are treated like any other non-Dutch company and can use the 'seat at the table'' option.

And yes, thats something we have been doing since early modern times. And it works good for us. We cant be forced to change our ways simply because the EU feels like we should. I mean, sure, we should be understanding as we now share a common market. And im out of principle agreeing that we should reform our taxes. But ill be damned if fools like Macron think they have the right to dictate how our tax system should work. And ill be damned if Merkel thinks she can ''demand'' we listen to what the Germans want, while she herself is instating toll for non Germans on highways part funded by Dutch subsidies because Dutch transport companies and Dutch civilians used it.

I know that was just a anectdote and basically irrelevant to the Dutch tax reform dicussion, but it shows something very important. It shows that the Germans feel like they can expect European 
collaboration based on EU principles and vallues whenever they feel like it benefits them, but goes completely against the same principles and vallues whenever it suits them.

So knowing that the Dutch citizen is already the biggest contributor to the EU budget per capita, what cards do you think Dutch politicians have in their hands? Would you willingly and without comments accept the demands from France and Germany? Or would you use this moment for a long term solution to a much larger problem? This problem being the political balance within the EU?

What kind of example would we make if we act submissive and do as the big boys want us to do? Note that the last elections in the Netherlands were celebrated as a EU victory because the VVD won, but the number of seats for anti-EU politicians has been rising since the early 2000s. The Macron comment was gold for people like Wilders. Its shit like that that fuels Dutch skeptism.

The Dutch feel like they are the ones who pay the bill of EU ambitions and projects yet get no place at the table where all the big decisions are made. Merkel was discussing trade relations with Trump between the EU and US, she had phone communication with Macron while in Washington. How insane is that considering that the Netherlands outranks both Germany and France in investments in the US? 

Wilders literally used that example in several speeches a few months ago. It worked greatly on his audience. Now i find Wilders a complete moron and will never back him up. But here s the catch. Since last year we have more parties openly anti-EU. Both on the left and right, both directed at higher educated/income people and wilders for the lower income/educated.

Something changed last year in the Netherlands. Wealthier and better educated people no longer have to be ashamed to admit that they vote anti-EU. Thats a big difference from 5 years ago. You would be instantly seen as a dumb ass racist PVV/Wilders supporter if you were anti EU. This will be a big thing next elections here.

Some of it is “There can’t be that big a difference or circ wouldn’t be that commonplace.” But speaking as an intact American guy (who knows a lot of intact American guys), I’d say a big factor is “Why draw attention to myself? Nothing can happen to circumcised guys. They’ve already been operated on and no one is after any other part of their penis. But every day of my life I’m vulnerable. Millions tell me I should get cut, millions more seem to delight in insulting me, and I don’t want to jinx things and end up having to get cut for some reason. So, mum’s the word.” 

Another factor is humility. Without having walked a mile in the other guy’s shoes, how do I know for certain that I have it better? And even if I’m sure of it, wouldn’t it be a dick move to start bragging about it? No good can come from telling circumcised guys that they’re inferior or missing out, or even implying it.

Ora, che la mentalità inglese sia un po' impregnata da una forma di superiorità a prescindere è vero, ma questo vale per tutti i grandi paesi europei e alla fin fine pure noi italiani tendiamo a autoflagellarci sul presente ma guai a chi ci tocca il passato, che si incazziamo come api.

Semmai è una opinione di un tipo che non conosce l'Italia pur vivendoci e che avrà scritto un articolo di riempimento sulla base di 5 stereotipi in croce e qualche figura tirata lì per fare scena (Giustiniano?!).

britisheastindiacomp,,British Empire Forever,"&gt; Maybe in the US, where the vast majority are Ashkenazim but not in Europe. In several European countries there are more Sephardic Jews than Ashkenazim

So I've just looked it up, and I will concede that France and Spain have more Sephardim, but  everywhere else, the Ashkenazim dominate. For example we have 260k Ashkenazim in the UK compared to 8k Sephardi.
