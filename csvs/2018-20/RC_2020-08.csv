&gt;this just leaves me more confused on how these people came to develop these languages in isolation

They weren't developed in isolation, the article says this:

&gt;*We are very confident that Nobiin (and later Dongolawi) came to the Nile from a centre of dispersion in Darfur-Kordofan which they occupied and controlled for perhaps 4000 years. We  know that there were Nubian speakers on the Nile at least as  early as the 500s CE  and probably much earlier. The fact that the Hill  Nubian languages have words  for the days of the week dating back to  Christian Nubian indicates that these  languages were in contact at  least during the Christian Nubian period which  probably covers 500 CE -  1400 CE. This does not necessarily mean that the Hill  Nubians did more  than expand from central Kordofan into the Nuba Mountains during the  period of Nubian  political dominance from Aswan to Kosti (at least).  But given the  location of the Hill Nubian speakers (Dair, Dilling,  Karko etc) along the NE  edge of the Mountains it appears that they were  ""incomers"" settling  among the existing Nyima and Temein groups who  were there before them.*

In other words: the Nubian languages likely don't originate from the Nile, but rather some place in Darfur-Kordofan (which makes a lot of sense, seeing that the Nubian langauges are the only Nilo-Saharan languages in a region dominated by Afroasiatic languages). Hill Nubian speakers are likely immigrants from a Nubian kingdom, but the idea that they migrated during the fall of Christian Nubia is unsupported by evidence.

**Edit:** As far as maintaining similarity with Nile Nubian, that's not particularly uncommon or odd. Numbers and common words usually tend to remain very close across related languages even if they split a long time ago. I'd look at the Indo-European vocabulary page on Wikipedia for examples of this.

This also shows that not all Nuba have links to the Nubians, and in the case of this article, the argument is that most Nuba don't.",True,False,False,,,,0,1596240087,,1596240867,0,{},fzxn81c,True,t3_i0hdpx,False,True,t1_fzxmcjm,/r/Sudan/comments/i0hdpx/history_of_the_nuba_article_breaking_down_the/fzxn81c/,False,,1604445281,1,True,False,Sudan,t5_2qvpt,r/Sudan,public,,0,[],

Wagner then wrote ""Jewishness in Music"" in 1850 which is essentially an anti-semitic rant directed at Meyerbeer (and Felix Mendelssohn too) for saying that Jews control the music ""industry"".

Rawanda: the majority Hutu population slaughtered the minority Tutsi population in a brutality that the world had never seen before
Iran: The Islamic majority decided that all other minorities were inferior, killing them, plundering their land and all sorts of other vile things

If the government is small enough it doesn't have any leverage thus removing the incentive behind lobbies. Political leverage would not get them anywhere you'd have a third party private company auditing. The contract runs out, if they fuck up their name in the market would be tarnished and the contract would not be renewed. That does not mean that noone would do it: there's no such thing as a perfect system, but it's better than the government funded police we have now.

&gt;Europe style healthcare functions much better than American style healthcare to my knowledge.

It's cheaper, not better. Anyone that wants to get grade A care and doesn't care about money travels to the US. Now why is the US's system so expensive? Government intervention again. Through the government's involvement in healthcare, insurance companies found a loophole (a leverage), and started lobbying for their interests which made the prices soar. The solution to that is not more government intervention, that would be like throwing gasoline into a fire. The solution is less government.

&gt;Yes, but is can you trust people to look after their retirement which will take place in 30 years? It will become a burden on the state either way if you don't guarantee a retirement pension.

If people know they have to be taking care of themselves, they would save more. That same money the government takes as taxes would be used as retirement fund. Don't forget that we pay taxes in many different ways. The loans Lebanon takes, the devaluation of the currency, all of these are forms of taxation.

Edit: also charities and private donations play a big role here. Lebanese people have been using that for a while now. 

&gt;Without an army with compulsory taxation for its benefit, you risk losing the free market. Also remember Lebanon is in the Near East, not Europe.

If the Lebanese people want an army, they can fund it without coercion. We all buy health insurance.

&gt;How would it go about earning without taxation or state property?

Just like any other business. The government can compete in the free market. If it needs to make money, let it provide a service that is better than what the other competitors are offering and it'd earn it.

I lived in Ethiopia for a few years, out in the bush for the most part but came through Addis a lot. Nice things about Addis: the nightlife, the downtown (once or twice), Entoto if it’s a nice day and if you don’t get robbed. The food is amazing in Addis, the best coffee of your life you can get at Tomoka... but that’s about it. 

The downsides of Addis: it’s a big city, it’s had rapid development mostly by Chinese companies. Everything is under construction. The roads have potholes which will swallow the 1960s era little tin can cars that they use for taxis. The nice part of town largely has no streetlights and you may also encounter goat carcasses because people in the cities still own and butcher livestock. 

If you want to have a relaxing atmosphere without being hassled by people and eat food you think you won’t get food poisoning from, you end up sooner or later in one of the big hotels, which are, for local standards, quite luxury. The mid-range, 3 star hotel I usually stay at, costs 90 USD per night and if you are lucky all of the parts of the bathroom actually work. The discrepancy of conditions means that you might be super happy with a mediocre Sheraton.

It has amazing food and amazing coffee and a flavor of Orthodox and Catholic Christianity that seem to be like nowhere else in the world. They use different ways of telling time and a different calendar (there are 13 months, New Years is in September), the people are incredibly kind and friendly.

As of the Obama admin, any time a captured illegal firearm was thought to be of US origin, the Mexican authorities would request help from the US ATF to help trace it. Only around 25% of confiscated guns were even suspected, and of those 48% could be confirmed. Overall, less than 12% of recovered illegal firearms in Mexico were able to be traced to the US.

The vast majority of illegal guns in the hands of the cartels, specifically, are bought on the international arms black market (via the same channels used to obtain industrial quantities of precursor chemicals - namely China), or stolen from Mexican police or military. And while it's true that the Mexican government originally sourced a significant portion of these firearms from US arms manufacturers, this is a completely separate issue from civilian gun sales (and more importantly, if the US created an arms embargo on Mexico - they'd just sources their guns from one of the dozens of other major arms manufacturing countries).

The (outright false) idea that the US is somehow responsible for ""most"" guns in Mexico came from a misleading / misquoted figure from a Bush-era Congressional testimony from an AD with the ATF - saying, in regard to specific smuggling operations within the US, that 90% of the firearms involved in arms crossing the US border destined for Mexico, were sourced in the US. Which is a bit like hearing ""most cars shipped from the US to Europe are American made"", but twisting it into ""most cars in the EU are American made"".

As of the Obama admin, the AFT maintained that civilian straw purchases in the US contribute a ""significant"" amount of firearms to the Mexican black market - but it's not clear what ""significant"" means (and whether that is referring to a portion of the 12% above, or some higher figure). In any case, vague references like this should be taken with a grain of salt from the ATF of the era (the admin was pushing heavily for gun control but couldn't pass legislation, so they relied on executive influence to make a difference via the ATF).

 t's really hard for me to talk to JQ people. Gonna engage in good faith for at least one more comment, but I can't reason you out of something you didn't reason yourself into. I've never seen a JQer who's reasoned themselves into their political ideology.

&gt;You're conflating different ideologies. 

I'm not saying these ideologies are the same. I'm saying that if a nation intentionally tries to indocrinates it's youth, it will be wildly successful in doing so - unless there's something preventing it from happening. 

America isn't widely successful. It's not intentionally indocrinating it's youth. 

&gt; Consider that the white Europeans who founded and maintained the nation are now barely half of it today.

You've given me no proof that indocrinating is happening. This link is a non sequitur. Changing  racial makeup ≠ socialist indocrinating.

&gt; In America, it's about subverting sovereignty and destroying homogeneity so that the rulers, often Jews, will not be expelled from a 110th region.

This is equivocation.

Earlier I falsely assumed you meant **socialist** indoctrination. Now you've said that this is about racial makeup. Socialism is an economic ideology. It has nothing to do with racial homogenity.

It seems like you're really worried about pro diversity indocrination, or something else entirely. We can switch to that if you like, but at that point we're no longer socialist indocrination.

Right idea, wrong argument.

In my opinion, your friend is both begging the question and oversimplifying.

First he is assuming that those people who refuse to wear masks during the SARS CoV-2 pandemic believe that wearing a mask furthers the nation and its people, but they simply so not want to be inconvenienced.

That is certainly not the case. They believe that mask use undermines the nation and its people. They believe it infringes on the principles (freedoms) that this country was based upon. They actually believe they are defending those very principles.
In fact, When push comes to shove, many would sacrifice health and safety to defend those principles from  social distancing, emergency measures, and mandatory masks. 

From that perspective, a strong argument could be made in the exact opposite direction: protecting one’s health and safety at the expense of one’s way of life is the furthest possible thing from sacrificing one’s health and safety to defend the abstract principle of nation, as many did in WWI.

Lastly, for the argument to work, you would have to buy into both questions being begged. Not just that the mask advances the principles of the nation and its people (I actually believe it does), but that the drafting of young men to be used as straw dogs in the death rattle of the last true European empires (to say nothing of the European aristocracy) is fucking madness!! These were not “The Germans” you were looking for- that’s WWII. 

Lest we never forget... 

Mask deniers are fools, but that doesn’t mean we should devolve to hyperbole and unreflective rhetoric.

The Magna Carta in 1215 essentially held the Monarchy accountable to the law. The Queen plays more of a ceremonial role as head of state and has to remain apolitical. The current Queen has a great deal of respect by the majority of the general public in the four CANZUK countries, she may have essentially been born into the role but she has done a substantial amount of good work during her reign which is the reason she has such public respect. The monarchy is a symbol but not a defining feature of the relations between the four countries. 

The people to people links are immensely strong between the four countries. ""**The United Kingdom is one of our most like-minded partners in the world. Australia and the UK have a significant and comprehensive relationship underpinned by our shared heritage, common values, strong people-to-people links, closely aligned strategic outlook and interests and substantial trade and investment links. We are frequent dialogue partners at the highest levels across government and are like‑minded on global issues such as international security, multilateral cooperation and economic issues on the G20 agenda.""**

Australia is the number 1 country of British emigration and it has more Brits in it than the entire EU27. Likewise the UK is the number 1 country Australians emigrate to. This is of course without a formal immigration agreement in place. The four CANZUK countries have a common language, similar common law political systems, similar food standards, similar healthcare systems, similar human rights, similar freedoms, similar standards of living. Once mutual recognition of professional qualifications and other similar frameworks are in place, there will probably be even more people going back and forth between the four countries. Already CANZ, Singapore, Japan and South Korean passports have been added to UK egates:

b) The UK government (and any future UK government led by any other political party) should actively be looking at new trade deals and improving existing trade deals all the time. It is in part the entire point of Brexit. Canada, Australia and New Zealand are countries that the UK in particular has a better relationship with than the rest of the countries in the EU do. As a result it has taken 7 years for Canada to negotiate a FTA with the EU, this FTA was done with a lot of help from the UK which was a member state of the EU when it was negotiated. Australia and New Zealand have never negotiated a FTA with the EU, due to disputes with other EU member states much to the UK's frustration. The UK despite the restrictions, tariffs and quotas imposed on it by EU membership has roughly about half its trade outside the EU27. Trade outside the EU is growing faster than trade in the EU particularly in the Asia-Pacific region but also North and South America. The UK will join the the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) which includes Australia, Japan, New Zealand and Singapore, as well as in Latin America and with Canada. Trade negotiations have been occurring with Japan who in particularly wanted to negotiate a trade deal with the UK before agreeing to allow it succession into CPTPP:

There is also a trade deal being negotiated with the USA however right now the USA is more focused on the November election. I suspect the FTA will be worked on in more depth mid November to December:

Continuity agreements have been signed with countries that had a trade agreement with the UK when it was part of the EU. These will likely be looked at again in the future in order to get a better deal specific to the UK and each respective country bilaterally:

OTC markets are also a little tricky because fees are sometimes charged there as well but not always. It’s hard to answer for sure since it varies from brokerage to brokerage.

China itself was still undergoing its century of almost nonstop warfare and Beijing, the city he visited, was brutally sacked by the 8 nation alliance just 2 decades prior. It was a pitiful sight for sure and this European man, young and no doubt full of arrogance, could not help but follow the vogue opinion of the times in that the world outside of the European Mainland and America, was nothing but barbarism and savagery.

There are other issues, though. The tribunal is made of people who are part of a community that is arguably becoming  more toxic over time. Consider how judgements change as the community becomes more and more toxic. Jurors may become more likely to assume the reported player is malicious, resulting in more negative judgements.

Also consider how the perceptions of the community can change over time. For example, there's a popular joke/meme among the League community about Yasuo players (I'm sure you're familiar). How does that seemingly harmless joke affect how tribunal jurors judge reported players who happen to be Yasuo mains?

Another problem to consider is regional differences. For example, when the tribunal was active in South Korea it punished players less for harassment and more for types of toxicity that affected the outcome of the match directly (e.g. feeding) compared to the US and EU. This might not seem like a problem to some people, but it could very well conflict with Riot's intentions for the tribunal (a statement which could apply to the entire tribunal system in general) and allow certain types of toxic behavior to flourish in some regions.

Yet another downside is how ineffective the tribunal is versus automated systems from a psychology perspective. Humans and other animals respond much more significantly to punishment/feedback when the time interval between their action and their consequences is small. Automated systems can provide that consequence in minutes, while the tribunal takes days or weeks. By that time, players might not even remember what got them reported in the first place, and they're much less likely to become ""reformed"" that way.

Couple of little additions/comments etc., that might help.

- Powerpoints: These are officially referred to as socket outlets in the standards, however in general parlance are usually referred to as GPOs (at least in my part of Australia)

- 413 Plug: You may also hear these referred to as surface sockets or plug bases. Also used in similar applications are quick connect sockets, which terminate by displacing the inner insulation similar to a data punch down, and only require the outer sheath to be removed.

- RCDs (GFCIs): We generally use the term RCD to refer to the device even though most commonly RCBOs are now used. RCDs are also (almost) always located in the switchboard, and only ever found in the field or incorporated into outlets in special purpose applications.

- Colour codes: Our standards are derivative of UK/European standards and there has been some attempt to harmonise them. While our standard installation colours are red/white/blue/black, our appliances use European colours (brown active, light blue neutral, etc.)

- Asbestos: Asbestos was not banned from use in commercial buildings until 2005, although it was heavily phased out prior to that. 

- A note on the white card: in some states it is mandatory on all commercial sites, there is also a supplementary asbestos awareness card. Many sites will not accept cards received from online courses, only from RTOs with a face to face delivery. Don't get scammed paying for a cheap card.

Lingo: 

- ""The C Word"": Context and tone are everything here. The same phrase could be meant as either an insult or endearingly. Also, casual use of the word cunt is much more common amongst tradies, working class, and lower socio economic groups. Much less common to hear it in casual conversation in an office environment, the university educated, or similar.
- Smoko: Surprised you missed this. If tradie is a culture, then smoko is a religion. (It's a mid morning break, usually 10-20 minutes, time enough for a quick coffee and breakfast). It's not actually/no longer a smoke break despite the name.
- Builder: Generally when someone refers to the builder they are talking about the principal contractor on a site.

Looks like they're doing by far the worst of any Nordic nation, and they have one of the highest death rates (per capita) of any European nation.

[The man who conceived and implemented the plan, Anders Tegnell has admitted that ""too many have died.""](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52903717) He's also quoted as saying:

&gt;""If we were to encounter the same disease again, knowing exactly what we know about it today, I think we would settle on doing something in between what Sweden did and what the rest of the world has done.""

Also, while the government didn't enforce social distancing, they did recommend it, and they banned gatherings of more than 50 people. They also recommended for avoiding long trips and public transport, and many companies have switched to working from home.


Also, the Swedish people **are** following social distancing guidelines, without having to be told so by their government, because they're (mostly) not assholes:

&gt; Anders Tegnell says his modelling indicates that, on average, Swedes have around 30% of the social interactions they did prior to the pandemic.

&gt; And a survey released this week by Sweden's Civil Contingencies Agency suggests 87% of the population are continuing to follow social distancing recommendations to the same extent as they were one or two weeks earlier, up from 82% a month ago. 

So, in summary: They did a lot more than people think, and they still have more dead bodies per capita than almost any other EU nation.

the national banks in the US during the panic of 1907 were less centralized than the fed, and it would've been worse under the fed.

nelson aldrich and new yorks banking elite had direct ties to european central bankers. it was in their best interest to create the fed, not the citizens.

Probably is a cultural barrier as an expat, but behaving as I'd normally do with a doctor results in them being dismissive, and being very direct results in them thinking I'm a rude foreigner that doesn't want to follow their rules.

I cite wikipedia if you don't trust that source then this breaks down, take care :).

Now, because they have had to endure this and fight for their lives, freedom from slavery, and to be seen as an equal person it's pointed out the inequality. Part of the effort to fix this inequality is encouraging pride in being black.

&gt;The US pays more than the UK per capita for healthcare. Socialised medicine costs less and works better.

US healthcare has problems beyond free market capitalism,  but the point was UK's healthcare will be more and more strained as the median citizen will be 53 years old in 2050. I hope I don't have to show you why elderly people require more healthcare than young people. We're going to have a huge problem with an ever increasing need to spend more on pensions and healthcare while the number of young people, as a percentage of the whole population is declining.  We can talk all day about whether welfare helps people using data from 1950-2020 but my worry is once the conditions change (negative population growth, aging population) it seems to me to be logical that states who depend on tax revenue to fund these programs will struggle to pay for these programs as the number of people on welfare will continue to rise, perhaps indefiitely for the time being.

&gt;I think you’re confused. The point I was responding to was the idea that more welfare would cause reduced tax revenue (presumably through lower employment or whatever). The empirical evidence on the topic is pretty clear, though, that the increased economic activity etc from welfare means that welfare actually increases tax revenue

We're talking about welfare in the past. My whole point was how sustainable is it given the changing conditions we are seeing right now.

&gt;The policies of the Nordics are really just orthodox Keynesianism: 

Keynesianism would have us borrow today to spend our way out of a crisis, acummulate debt which we ideally repay during boom times. Given the problem outlined above, the said states will have to borrow to pay the pensions today and borrow a year from now and 10 years from now until wait, are we ever paying this back? 

&gt;Everyone always tries to come up with excuses why the high tax &amp; Hugh welfare system that works in Norway etc wouldn’t work elsewhere

Because Norway has a trillion dollar resource offshore to fund it's welfare. It also has a population of only 5 million meaning the per capita the oil and oil investment is worth about $200k. It would be conceivable for norway to build every one of her citizens a house without having to raise a single tax. ""Look at norway! They can build a house for everyone, eliminate homelessness *and* are not broke!"" It's disingenuine. If you want welfare you first need to create wealth to distribute it.  Sweden had that experience in the 1970s and 1980s, which is why it's one of the most vocal country about the need for free market and free trade. What policy did Norway enact that helped it collect huge revenues that it could then spend on welfare?

Italy is the typical example of a country that simply cannot follow the Nordic model, because it's conditions and position is different. Of course Italy can mirrow Sweden to some degree, promote free capitalism etc but its population (62m) and natural resources do not allow for it to be like Norway.

*""countries with higher 
percentage of foreign-born population also have more restricted uptake of benefits by migrants""*

*""There is substantial support for ethnic competition theory and hypothesis 1a, higher ethnic diversity leading to more restrictive generosity, by different proxies""*

*""The data further suggests that countries where low skilled migrants make up more than 30% of all migrants are less generous than countries with smaller percentage of low skilled migrants when considering access to unemployment and medical care benefits.""*

Makes sense, because to run a welfare state you need high level of societal trust and honesty. Immigrants are seen as breaking this cohesion creating ethnic competition

All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre: Pope and Tsar, Metternich and Guizot, French Radicals and German police-spies.
Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as communistic by its opponents in power? Where is the opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach of communism, against the more advanced opposition parties, as well as against its reactionary adversaries?
Two things result from this fact:
I. Communism is already acknowledged by all European powers to be itself a power.
II. It is high time that Communists should openly, in the face of the whole world, publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the Spectre of Communism with a manifesto of the party itself.
To this end, Communists of various nationalities have assembled in London and sketched the following manifesto, to be published in the English, French, German, Italian, Flemish and Danish languages.
I. Bourgeois and Proletarians*
The history of all hitherto existing society† is the history of class struggles.
Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master‡ and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.
In the earlier epochs of history, we find almost everywhere a complicated arrangement of society into various orders, a manifold gradation of social rank. In ancient Rome we have patricians, knights, plebeians, slaves; in the Middle Ages, feudal lords, vassals, guild-masters, journeymen, apprentices, serfs; in almost all of these classes, again, subordinate gradations.
The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones.
* By bourgeoisie is meant the class of modern capitalists, owners of the means of social production and employers of wage labour. By proletariat, the class of modern wage labourers who, having no means of production of their own, are reduced to selling their labour power in order to live. [Engels, 1888 English edition]
† That is, all written history. In 1847, the pre-history of society, the social organisation existing previous to recorded history, all but unknown. Since then, August von Haxthausen (1792-1866) discovered common ownership of land in Russia, Georg Ludwig von Maurer proved it to be the social foundation from which all Teutonic races started in history, and, by and by, village communities were found to be, or to have been, the primitive form of society everywhere from India to Ireland. The inner organisation of this primitive communistic society was laid bare, in its typical form, by Lewis Henry Morgan's (1818-1861) crowning discovery of the true nature of the gens and its relation to the tribe. With the dissolution of the primeval communities, society begins to be differentiated into separate and finally antagonistic classes. I have attempted to retrace this dissolution in The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State, second edition, Stuttgart, 1886.

Awesome! By learning even just a tiny bit of Hieroglypic you will get a unique insight into Egyptian thought and religion. I forgot, remember to download the PDF for ""Decoding the Secrets of Egyptian Hieroglyphs"". It has a summary of every lesson, gives a tiny bit of homework (and the answers) and it also has a list of hieroglyphs, pronouns and a dictionary. The [History of Ancient Egypt](https://www.thegreatcoursesplus.com/history-of-ancient-egypt) is also great (but a bit old) and don't forget its PDF either. Good luck, I bet you will love learning Hieroglyphic and Egyptian history!

&gt; Are modern day Egyptians still learning Hieroglyphics in school? That would be a great way of keeping the culture alive.

Arabic and Ancient Egyptian would sound similar to Europeans/Americans because they are both *Afro-Asiatic languages* but they are very different and mutually unintelligible. Egypt actually considered using a modified form of egyptian hieroglyphs to write Arabic but it was abandoned in favor of Arabic. Today Coptic (using greek letters) clings on in a handful of Coptic families by being passed on orally but those who speak Coptic are just as fluent in it as Arabic so a [revival like modern Hebrew](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HBiiad9fO-g) would be possible but it's not on the table at the moment. You can learn Coptic yourself and for starters there's [many](https://m.youtube.com/user/sgyouthservant/videos?view=0&amp;sort=da&amp;flow=list) free videos about it [online](https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJG-bLjAjVOlHWI-Vxl681LP7N-TSnJQo) but Coptic's sole usage today is reading the Bible. As Bob Brier will show the Exodus in Coptic is a treasure trove of information about Ancient Egypt.

The English equivalent, Gentile, IMO is offensive in the other way as it comes from Genteel and was meant to make the distinction between the supposedly Genteel European Christian and the barbarous Jew.

Koliko je NDH afirmativna pojava u hrvatskoj istoriji, govori činjenica da je Hrvati izuzimaju iz kontinuiteta istorijske državnosti. Svest o tome je Srbima mnogo više od neprijatne epizode.

Sad, zašto Srbi nisu prihvatili plan koji bi im omogućio autonomnost u okviru Hrvatske možda ima neke veze s tim što ni Hrvati nisu tražili za sebe entitet u Bosni, odnosno sa aranžmanima koje su Sloba i Franjo pravili među sobom.

You said

&gt;We know from polling that more support indy than the SNP on its own.

I don't care about polling I've made that clear many many times now, polling can be wrong, there are margin of errors between it and the actual result of  voting in an election. The SNP having the most seats means nothing when they didn't get the required majority support for Indy like the Unionists did.

Once again INDY PARTIES GOT 46%, UNIONIST PARTIES GOT 56%. 

&gt;But it's relevant. 

&gt;Why would this be settled another way when it doesn't seem like it was for the UK's question on the EU.

&gt;Tories promised a referendum. 

&gt;Got elected on won and held it.

&gt;Despite most voting for pro-EU parties in the 2015 election.

That depends on my view on the Brexit referendum doesn't it? If I disagreed with the UK doing it after not having Parliamentary support then I'm not being hypocritical.

&gt;For some reason you think that the Scottish shouldn't get one because the SNP ""only"" got 45% of the vote.

No I just disagree with your statement that ""the majority of Scotland wants independence"" and your assertion that the independence movement has a mandate when Scotland in an actual election (which once again I obviously need to point out is more valid than polls) voted majority Unionist parties. Most Scottish voters voted for Unionist Parties not Indy parties.

Something big might have to happen in the 1940s/50s to stop it. 

The second thing is what takes its place. 
If we don't see a flowering (in places) of liberalism, what do we see? A swing to the right, or a continuation of the status quo? 

Lastly, what comes after? How do the kids react? What do we see 1980-2000?


WW2, it can be argued, turbocharged a liberal movement in the West after huge swathes of the general public witnessed totalitarianism in action. Racism, sexism and religious hatred were associated with the enemies of freedom, to various degrees.
Now that sentiment certainly didn't last long. Jim Crow didn't die in the war, but he was injured.
Seeds were planted.
Talking of seeds, the boomer generation are a significant factor here. They were relatively well off, numerous and not their parents.

Let's say the war lasts longer, or Russia gets nukes, or push on against th Allies past the Elbe. 
More death leads to fewer survivor to have children, less money &amp; resources, possibly a drive towards further conservatism as a survival measure in the next Generation to restrict the chance of further war. Appeasement, perhaps.
After WW1, a scarred Europe used appeasement to not go into war again. Not thru weakness.

So the grey 60s-80s drone on. Kids are now being born not burned by war. Living in greyness. They want colour and freedom. Anti nukes. Anti hate. 
A wave of passive resistance starts across the British Empire. Independence flowers in India and Africa in the 1990s. It spreads. Soviet France, aided by a Spain free of Francoism breaks free. Soviet tanks can't keep the Eurobloc together with US convert support in Germany, and on and on. Today, president Putin is assassinated by an angry KGB faction, which leads to a bloody civil war and more independence in Europe in the 2020s...

That's my take &amp; thoughts anyway. It's done on the hoof, so many be big issues I have missed, so appologies for that.

The terms so vague and meaningless even just in the U.K. The Boris Johnson government get called Right wing but they’re basically ‘New Labour’ with points based immigration policy (which outside of the EU is totally normal) and a couple other caveats. 

Not trying crap on your post but what people think of as Left and Right is constantly changing within countries (let alone between them) so that makes things harder to pin down. But I think, at least for the U.K., most people who are labour supporters, and lets say ‘New Labour’, are mainly a remain group and they make up the bulk of the ‘Left’. It’s only the hard core socialists and communists that didn’t like the EU (Corbyn). 

I’m saying this because I’m guessing for a lot of remainers they see CANZUK as a right wing idea (initially) because it’s the not the EU-which is seen as progressive and morally superior (rightly or wrongly). Firstly, because CANZ are not seen as ‘foreign’, secondly; ties to the Empire and thirdly because the EU has marketed itself so well as progressive force (rightly or wrongly). These three things makes it hard for New Labour people to attach themselves to CANZUK unless they’ve seen more than a meme. Whereas Conservatives don’t particularly care for the EU all that much. That lack of attachment makes it an easier thing to get on board with at first glance.

As you maybe know, Zimbabwe was called Rhodesia immediately after its independence. It was a de facto one party dictatorship under the Rhodesian front. The front was seeking independence from Great Britain, but was also of the opinion that the white minority was naturally superior to the „black race“ and therefore a country by whites for whites should be established. Things got pretty bad and the state lost a revolutionary war against Mugabe and his alles, who himself became a dictator after that. Rhodesia was boycotted by most countries for its racist ideology. 

For white supremacists and similar racist organisations, Rhodesia became kind of a martyr. The fact that Zimbabwe is a total mess is their favourite example to prove black inferiority. That’s the reason why you’ll find some mentions of BLM down here in the comments, even though an American social justice movement doesn’t have a lot to do with the failed land reform of a African dictatorship. They’ll bring up the story how the international’s community (controlled by the group of your choice) suppressed white excellence in favour of black barbarism. Sometimes it’s an early example of the white genocide coming to Europe and the USA they fear so much.

If you invite a group of people out to eat then almost always you will order for the whole party - albeit with some discussion.  Generally dishes are shared.  So you order enough bulk (bread or rice), sides (often salads) and then some meat and fish (usually grills) to be shared.  The food in restaurants is kind of designed that way and you wouldn't normally see in restaurants the sort of single serve style dishes (stews etc) that people eat at home.  For a big party, people will quite often call ahead to alert the kitchen that there's ten people coming in for the whole roast sheep (I kid you only partly).  The person who issues the invite pays - and to be honest, we're a big bragging, show off culture, so you let them.

The other kind of eating out in smaller parties (up to four say) is different too.  If I'm out with two friends the rule is we order bulk, a couple of sides and one more grill/main than the number in the party.  So if there's three of us, we order four grills (writing it like that it sounds like an enormous amount of food, but portions are modest, honest).  Now, when the food arrives you share.  So, tldr, took a British friend to a traditional place with a couple of old country friends and we ordered.  He chose a nice grill.  When the food arrived he picked it up and dumped the whole lot on his plate.  Fortunately he was oblivious to the distress this caused my friends and I didn't see any point in saying anything.

My friend who was from NY changed to an SC license when her NY DL ran out while she was a student in SC.

She decided not to get another NY one because in SC and elsewhere she had issues with bouncers thinking it was fake - apparently around that time NY DL were on a very thin plastic, which if you're used to the credit card Thickness which is usual then it can be an issue.

But when she was back in NY she had further issues. Apparently many bouncers spotted fakes by bending the corners together... Which would snap the DL of pretty much every other state.

So basically every time she went back to NY they'd snap her DL and then she couldn't drink for the remainder of the break.

My South Korean friend had it differently. They thought her passport was fake because in SK they put the DOB as the international standard of yyyy/mm/dd. They were fine with the European dd/mm instead of American mm/dd but putting the year first really threw them for a loop. They actually tried to confiscate it as a fake but she threatened to call the cops.

I had to leave the squad, de-tag, re-tag, and THEN I could post.  After that I saw several others so don’t know if it was to do with me that my LFG came down and I couldn’t post a new or see any, or something was happening to the LFG system.

Thousands of bicycles are stolen in the city every year. Bicycle brand VanMoof came up with something against the theft of their expensive city bikes: they send bike hunters on the hunt. ""You have to be strong for this job.""

Tahrim RamdjanJuly 30, 2020 , 11:52 am
It's summer vacation, but chemistry student Idse Luirink (22) is working hard in the office of bicycle brand VanMoof on the Mauritskade in East. He and his colleague Indigo Versteeg (25) are looking at the map of Amsterdam on his laptop. Dozens of red dots attract attention: all stolen VanMooff bicycles. When Luirink zooms out, the map of the Netherlands appears - with a few stray red dots in Utrecht and Gelderland - and then that of all of Europe. “Romania is apparently a hot spot,” says Luirink, pointing to the ten red dots there.


Luirink and Versteeg work as bike hunters . Bicycle brand VanMoof employs 25 all over the world, in every branch: from Berlin to Tokyo. Five bicycle hunters are permanently working in Amsterdam. Two to three days a week, they try to recover stolen bicycles from the brand. The bicycles, which cost an average of two thousand euros each, have a built-in chip in the frame, which emits a location every half hour as soon as the bicycle is reported as stolen. Sometimes that location is not entirely accurate and the bike hunters have to investigate on the spot.

Fear of theft
VanMoof founder Taco Carlier (42) noticed that many of his friends in the city did not dare to ride an electric bicycle. ""Everyone was afraid it would be stolen,"" he says. “Theft is the main reason why people worldwide don't buy a high-quality bicycle.” From his technical background - Carlier studied at TU Delft - the idea arose to build in a tracker. “Many people didn't believe it at first. But I can still remember the adrenalin from the first bike hunt , on the Leidsegracht. That was so addictive. Then everyone wanted to join the office. ”

 
The red dots on the map of Amsterdam are all stolen VanMooffiets. IMAGE MARC DRIESSEN
How do you become a bicycle hunter? “I live in Oud-West and I study at Science Park in the Watergraafsmeer,” says Luirink. “I was hesitant between a scooter and a bicycle, but soon ended up with a VanMoo bike. In the shop I saw a vacancy for a bike hunter . ” Versteeg worked in the festival industry, but thought he spent too much time in the office. ""I really liked VanMoof's bikes, and the track suited what I wanted: less in the office.""

Golden area
When Luirink cycles to and from lectures, he sometimes looks up a stolen bicycle along the way. ""Then I will stop by and I will be finished half an hour later."" Versteeg even went abroad to track down bicycles. ""We drove to Essen in Germany, but at some point the chip was no longer transmitting,"" he says. A blue container stood at the indicated location in Essen. When they opened it, there was no bicycle in sight. However, the stolen bicycle suddenly sent a signal in Antwerp. ""It was a quick consultation with the head office: what are we going to do?"" Versteeg was allowed to drive to Belgium at the expense of the business and book a hotel stay. He spent the night searching with the local police for a bicycle in the port of Antwerp. ""That was quite exciting, but for this work you have to be strong and not just accept no.""

Unfortunately, he nevertheless returned to Amsterdam empty-handed. Nevertheless, Versteeg's adventure was not in vain: the bike hunters film everything they do, including for VanMoof's social media channels. “When we're not on the hunt, we also research the bikes that are the most interesting to find.”

Carlier says there are two types of hunts. In the first type, bicycle hunters look for stolen bicycles in the city. In principle, VanMoof offers a 'recovery guarantee' for every bicycle within two weeks after theft. Five to twenty VanMoof bicycles are stolen worldwide every month. Seventy percent of those are recovered within those two weeks. If those two weeks are not met, the owner will receive a new copy.

In the second kind, hunters look up the most interesting stories. ""That is not profitable,"" says Carlier. “In fact, they often don't even take those bikes back. But that is how they put the theme of bicycle theft on the map. ” And somewhere it is also an investment, he hopes. “Ultimately, bicycle thieves see that and will be careful to steal a VanMoof.”

Two years ago, a bike hunter went to Casablanca in Morocco, against the advice of the local police. The bicycle initially remained without a trace, but still sent a signal a year later. This led to the discovery of an entire department store full of stolen bicycles.

Sometimes a cold case is reopened, such as today. The bicycle that Versteeg and Luirink are looking for was reported as stolen in January and did not send a signal for six months - until this week. The hunters set off in the center of Amsterdam. ""That is always a golden area, where we find many bicycles,"" says Luirink. “We often find a bicycle only two hundred meters away from where it was parked. Then someone tried to steal it, but failed. ”

Found full of stickers
He must be standing somewhere at the Spiegelgracht. Modest clouds have given way to a relentless downpour. ""That is also part of the job, sometimes cycling for hours through the rain and not finding anything,"" says Versteeg. The men are well prepared: they have a tracker that goes off when the bicycle is within fifteen meters. They also take a grinder with them, because stolen bicycles go back to the head office in East.

Bike hunters have developed a sixth sense for stolen bicycles, says Versteeg: ""If there is another lock around the bicycle or it has been handled incorrectly, such a bicycle will stand out."" Today that sixth sense also has an effect: they find the VanMoof in the Fokke Simonszstraat, covered with stickers. ""That makes such a bicycle suspicious,"" says Luirink. ""Especially since the taillight of stolen VanMoofs always flashes, and precisely that taillight was taped.""

They are sure that it is the right bike when the tracker goes off. Who thinks of a penetrating siren is wrong: the sound that is heard is the same sound that you hear when you find a Pokémon on a Nintendo game computer.

 
IMAGE MARC DRIESSEN
Versteeg grinds the bike loose. This often leads to surprised looks among passers-by. “But we always wear our VanMoof clothing and are happy to explain it,” says Luirink. ""Most people find it funny."" Sometimes the bike hunters also call the police in advance, so that they are informed. This time, it remains with two women who are looking desperately at the scene, but still run away, and a mail delivery boy who can laugh about it.

The search for the bicycle that had been stolen six months ago took only fifteen minutes. With one hand on their own handlebars and the stickered bicycle on the other, the men return to the office, happy with their catch. ""Nice, old man,"" one says to the other.

Vou ilustrar, vc é tipo um X-Men e precisa de um professor Xavier pra te ajudar a controlar seus poderes e usá-los para o bem. 

Vc tem q ver com naturalidade a influência dos espíritos em nossa vida, não como algo sobrenatural ou maléfico. Muitos médiuns têm medos e o medo existe quando desconhecemos a natureza daquilo q nos causa medo. Não tenha medo. A relação dos espíritos conosco jamais será como nos filmes de terror onde os espíritos assombram e matam os encarnados.

**There is so much rift about corona vaccines that far from everyone can be helped right away.**  

There is reason for optimism because a new Danish experiment with corona vaccine at the Statens Serum Institut has shown promising results in tests on mice.

\- It is certainly positive. Denmark has a lot to offer in the development of a vaccine and has a long history of vaccine production, says Flemming Konradsen, professor of global health at the University of Copenhagen.

This is the second Danish attempt which, within a few months, offers a serious bid for a knockout in the fight to stop the worldwide corona pandemic.

\- The more horses we have to play on, the better. We know that far from all vaccine candidates finish. You have to develop and test a wide range before you have a sufficiently effective vaccine without side effects, Flemming Konradsen explains. 

## Human experiments in 2021

The good results mean that the Statens Serum Institut now plans to move on to the next phase, which is to test the vaccine candidate on monkeys.

The Statens Serum Institut has an ambition to be able to begin so-called phase 1 trials on humans in the autumn or early 2021, says chief virologist, professor and chief physician dr . with. Anders Fomsgaard, who is leading the experiment. 

He shares the assessment that more effective vaccines only benefit the global fight against Covid-19.

\- When many people need a vaccine , it is important that there are different to take off. In terms of production and supply, you must have as many eggs in the basket as possible. It could also be that they work differently, so some work best on older people, while others work on younger people, he says. 

Over 12 million people have been tested positive for coronavirus worldwide and the demand for an effective vaccine will be so great that there is not enough for everyone to begin with, predicts Flemming Konradsen.

\- We do not want billions of doses ready right away, and there may soon be a political demand that Mr and Mrs Jensen should also benefit from the vaccine . We will end up with some becoming winners in the distribution of a vaccine , he says. 

## The United States and Europe can secure everything

He predicts a global discussion on whether to distribute the first vaccines globally or regionally.

Whether a vaccine should be given according to age groups or risk groups. And about how solidary they should be offered. 

Whether, for example, the most vulnerable in hospitals and nursing homes in Europe should have the vaccine before healthcare professionals in Africa or Latin America .

A country can also try to buy everything on the market, as happened in the United States, which has secured the corona drug Remdesivir for three months ahead of Europe and the rest of the world.

\- The same discussion could arise in Europe, where it really requires political courage and a man's heart to say that health professionals in, for example, Malawi must be taken into account before someone in the risk group in Europe, says Flemming Konradsen. 

For the sake of global health, we should already now think about training staff and securing infrastructure so that you do not end up in a scenario where the vaccine, for example, never reaches a poor part of the world, because, among other things, something as basic as cooling systems is missing. to store the vaccine in.

\- There are already children who die because they do not have access to vaccines we have already developed. In the tail of vaccine development, there must be a system so that low-income countries with both poor infrastructure and health care also have easy access to the vaccine , points out Flemming Konradsen.

Experts estimate that it will take at least a year or more before a vaccine is ready to enter the market.",True,False,False,,,,0,1596287280,,False,0,{},fzzb4s6,True,t3_i1rwb3,False,True,t3_i1rwb3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/i1rwb3/expert_on_danish_corona_trials_good_with_another/fzzb4s6/,False,,1604475391,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],

It wasn't pleasant at all, but Germany had the Benelux, the baltics, the slovaks, slovens, austrians and fins on their side, and managed to get roughly what they wanted most of the time. But as the largest members of that government coalition in the Eurogroup they got targeted for a lot of hate as a result. At the same time, the PIGS, as they were called, got a lot of nasty comments as well. It was a very divisive period since Eurogroup negotiations are purely national, no parliament or EU rules involved, so nationalism gets involved a lot.

I imagine from your comment on holding the same position as Germany, I take it your country was part of the F4. The insults leveled on Germany simply transfered to the other largest member. And, even worse, while Germany lead a majority coalition, the F4 are a tiny fraction, making even more enemies as a result.

But the veto was the thing that turn things really acrimonious, because the veto doesn't make everyone equal with each other. Instead it makes any one member equal to the other 26 in total. This gets a lot of impressions of being totalitarian and dictatorial, and it was not a smart move to use it as leverage in the long term. Cameron did the same in 2011, and he got exiled politically as a result.

I guess what I am trying to say is: I am utterly confused on your positions of ""being too small to matter""  because you got some hate. If anything, the hate was directed because you mattered in a very important issue, and mattered so much you stood against not only a majority of members, but a majority of the EU population.

You're trying to put the absolute rate into words but we have clear statistics on it: [“The number needed to [circumcise] to prevent one HIV infection varied, from 1,231 in white males to 65 in black males, with an average in all males of 298.”](http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision) That originates from the CDC.

A terrible statistic. Especially when circumcision is not effective prevention and condoms must be used regardless.

And to be clear, that's the exact same data set presented in two different ways; relative rate and absolute rate. For details on how those numbers work [you can check out Dr. Guest's critique on the HIV studies.](https://youtu.be/XwZiQyFaAs0?t=1h01m10s)

And we can look at the real world results: [“The African findings are also not in line with the fact that the United States combines a high prevalence of STDs and HIV infections with a high percentage of routine circumcisions. The situation in most European countries is precisely the reverse: low circumcision rates combined with low HIV and STD rates. Therefore, other factors seem to play a more important role in the spread of HIV than circumcision status. This finding also suggests that there are alternative, less intrusive, and more effective ways of preventing HIV than circumcision, such as consistent use of condoms, safe-sex programs, easy access to antiretroviral drugs, and clean needle programs.""](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2013/03/12/peds.2012-2896)

But there's another very big aspect. HIV via sex is not relevant to newborns or children. The authors above continue: [""As with traditional STDs, sexual transmission of HIV occurs only in sexually active individuals. Consequently, from an HIV prevention perspective, if at all effective in a Western context, circumcision can wait until boys are old enough to engage in sexual relationships. Boys can decide for themselves, therefore, whether they want to get circumcised to obtain, at best, partial protection against HIV or rather remain genitally intact and adopt safe-sex practices that are far more effective.  As with the other possible benefits, circumcision for HIV protection in Western countries fails to meet the criteria for preventive medicine: there is no strong evidence for effectiveness and other, more effective, and less intrusive means are available.

In Europe languages within the major families (Germanic, Slavic, Romance) kind of continuously morph into each other (it was even more so in the past before people had TV and Internet).

I think the example that was commonly used was that if you start somewhere in Italy and go to Paris the language in any village may not differ that drastically from the previous one (they are still mutually intelligible) but Parisian French is definitely not Italian. But where do you draw the line when each village can understand its neighbors? They are speaking ""dialects"" but are they Italian or French dialects?

I am sure some of these phenomena exist in Chinese as well. I am only somewhat familiar with Mandarin and Cantonese and they do look like different languages to me, but certainly there are some in between forms. People in the south speak Mandarin differently than people in the north. Also Cantonese speakers tend to pronounce some sounds differently even when speaking Mandarin, perhaps not making a clear distinction between sounds that are not different in Cantonese.

To make things more complicated there is even a way how to read ""formal Chinese"" by a Cantonese speaker, which is kind of like Mandarin with a Cantonese pronunciation, so which language is it?

[],,[deleted],,,,,,,dark,,,,,[],"It’s not often that feminists threaten legal action over plans to increase women’s representation on public boards, so the Scottish Government has managed something of a feat. 'For Women Scotland', a volunteer-funded gender-critical lobby group, isn’t against the principle of the Gender Representation on Public Boards Act. It’s the Scottish Government’s definition of ‘women’ they have a problem with.

The statutory guidance for the Act defines ‘woman’ to include a transwoman without a gender recognition certificate who nonetheless must meet three criteria:

1) enjoys the protected characteristic of gender reassignment under the Equality Act 2010

2) is proposing to undergo or has already undergone a process to change their sex from male to female

3) is living as a woman.

The law 'would not require the person to dress, look or behave in any particular way’, but ‘it would be expected that there would be evidence that the person was continuously living as a woman’, for example, by employing female pronouns or using their female name on their driving licence, passport and utility bills.

On its face, and to anyone not familiar with the labyrinthian intricacies of gender law, this might sound like a reasonable compromise to accommodate a minority population. But For Women point to a clarification in the guidance: ‘The Act does not require an appointing person to ask a candidate to prove that they meet the definition of woman in the Act.’ This represents a ‘wholesale redefinition of women’, according to For Women, and they suspect the law on gender recognition is being changed by stealth.

The group’s spokeswoman Marion Calder says:

‘It beggars belief that the Scottish Government has introduced new legislation that contravenes the very essence of what a “woman” is in law. This is just the introduction of self-identification of sex by the back door… We believe this Act raises significant concerns for the status of women in Scotland. As a tool for increasing the representation of women, it is rendered ineffective and may be used as precedent to undermine legal protections for women in a manner which runs counter to UK and EU equality law.’

The campaigners’ lawyers have sent a letter to the Scottish Government, citing a legal opinion from Aidan O’Neill, one of the QCs behind the Supreme Court challenge to Boris Johnson’s prorogation of Parliament. The group contends that the Scottish Government is redefining ‘women’ in a manner that exceeds its authority under the Scotland Acts, which reserve equalities law to Westminster.

They also argue that ministers ‘failed to assess the impact of applying the new law on the need to advance equality between women and men, or consider the need to foster good relations’. They warn that should Nicola Sturgeon’s government press ahead, they will consider seeking a judicial review. A Scottish Government spokesperson said: 'We will give the letter full consideration when we receive it.'

This is a headache the SNP doesn’t need but, it must be said, one they keep bringing on themselves. Their determination to remove medical experts from the gender recognition process — allowing people to ‘self-identify’ as male or female — has caused bitter division in the ranks of a party typified by Stepfordish unanimity.

Last June, Scottish ministers announced a pause and a fresh consultation to assuage critics before shelving the changes when Covid-19 hit. But there is a fervent commitment to gender ideology both within the Scottish Government and the upper echelons of the SNP, so it’s not surprising that For Women are on alert for legislative jiggery-pokery. For gender critical women within the SNP, the Sturgeon administration’s approach to these matters puts them in an impossible position, forcing them to choose between what they believe and who they are.

What is exasperating is that, in allowing themselves to be talked into a brazen overreach, politicians at Holyrood and Westminster raised the hopes of transgender campaigners while provoking a backlash from those with profound political and philosophical objections not only to particular policies but the ideas that underpin them. They made promises so far-reaching and with such disregard for public consent that they created the circumstances in which their assurances could not be delivered. For all their progressive rhetoric, these self-styled champions of equality have succeeded only in subjecting trans people to an acrimonious debate about deeply personal matters and are causing women to be cast as bigots for asserting their rights under a law barely a decade old.

Although this particular building is a bit younger (late 17th-century), the Place des Vosges is often described as the oldest public square in France, and was created in 1605 as a way to renew the urban landscape of Paris, which suffered a lot from the civil war of Religion. Because of its peculiar shape creating and oasis of calm in a dense city, and the prestige of its origins, it evolved to become one of the most expensive neighborhoods in Europe, often considered the ultimate status symbol in France.

If you are interested in the history of Paris, a few friends and I, PhD historians in academia, produced [a documentary on the place des Vosges](https://youtu.be/8hFI9ScQVac) (in French) covering how it evolved from modest dwellings for silk workers to the epitome of aristocracy.

&gt; On Friday, the leading infectious disease expert in the US, Dr Anthony Fauci, said he hoped that Russia - and China - were &amp;quot;Actually testing the vaccine&amp;quot; before administering them to anyone.

&gt; Scores of possible coronavirus vaccines are being developed around the world and more than 20 are currently in clinical trials.

Obama did some shady shit, but he was a decent leader and tried to help the US's image problem.

Angela merkel after meeting with trump held a press conference the next day, even tho she wasnt supposed to hold one and said ""The times where we can rely on others is to the most extend over. Germany and the EU have to work together and cant rely on others any more""

I disagree that religion is adapted to locals, as much as I think locals are adapted to a religion, via destruction and rebuilding of their holy sites, suppression of their language, subordination of their mythical figures as minor prophets/saints/figures within aspects of Christianity. They didn't so much blend in pagan beliefs or representations of their gods as co-opt and strip them of their identities like the Borg assimilate cultures.

You won't find any Mormons painting pictures of black prophets when they go on their missionary trips to Africa, for example, nor does the Catholic Church generally allow that depiction within its churches, even in Africa. Depicting Jesus as black or Korean or any other ethnicity is relatively rare. Eurocentric and/or white centric supremacy in religion has been used to justify colonialism and human degradation for centuries. But it also strongly informs modern day American politics, which have repercussions all over the world. This is an interesting article/podcast on the topic.

If you are referring to Jamal Pasha then that's completely different, he is not an ottoman and a Turkish nationalist and it was in the last few years of the empire. Judging a Muslim civilization entire history by nationalists who hijacked and took control of it at the last few years of it's life is narrow minded and idiotic. Also what Jamal Pasha did might be wrong but it definitely is not genocide. 

""Backward thinking"". I don't understand this. What are you referring to? They didn't go around promoting backward thinking. The ottoman empire was one of the most tolerant states in history, especially compared to its European rivals. 

Man all you just said was being a French colony is ""better"" than being an integral state part of a Muslim civilization? You don't even give any evidence on their supposed ""cruel"" rule, you just throw it into your passage. What did the french do other than suppress and kill syrians? Maybe they build a road or a railroad here and there but not because they cared for Syrians, it was to run their colonies more effectively and to move troops faster to quell rebellions. Also you said ""culturally""? What? Do you not understand how much culture was spread around in the ottoman empire, so many different cultures co existing together created a multicultural civilization that saw these cultures interact and share things with one another. Food is one easy example that comes to mind, along with language similarities. Please be informed on french colonialism before you say something so out of reality in history. Look at how France massacred and genocided so many in Algeria and funneled in French settlers to replace the Algerian population. France literally labelled Syria along with other Arab countries as mandates with Britain because they thought we were ""too savage and uncivilized"", to rule ourselves. And you want to tell me we gained from them? 

This arguemnt that colonizers gave technology and helped colonies prosper is false and used mainly by racists and the far right to justify colonial empires. In reality, technology travels around pretty much the moment it gets invented, and all sources show that natives of a colony started innovating and using technology to modernize and get their country going (specifically after the colonizer leaves) to find it's place in the world. This is what happened in Syria like many other former colonies.

There will also be differences in shipping, import taxes, distribution and storage costs etc which could move the associated costs of getting the things where they need to be up and down depending on the details.

[],,[deleted],,,,,,,dark,,,,,[],"Bloomberg had an Op-ed about how millennials are becoming ""socialists"" because of everything that has occurred in the past twenty years.

The specific part that I found most interesting was that when the '08 recession occurred, millennials were, more than previous generations, unemployed and especially paid less than prior generations, and the interesting part that they brought up was that they had to resort to service jobs. Not only is it bad for their future income because what you're paid at the beginning of your career typically is the trajectory of your future income, but fast forward 12 years, and we have a pandemic that is not only ruining employment opportunities for younger generations--now, including Gen Z--but *the pandemic is especially hitting service jobs.* So what we at least had in the '08 recession is not there now if things take a turn for the worse during the pandemic.

It also pointed out the hypocrisy--as this post has pointed out--of what people have apparently called ""Boomer Socialism,"" a term I actually had never heard before. The fact that older generation have social programs afforded to them, but they're all too frequently telling younger generations to deal with their problems alone. [If you care to read it, here it is.](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-07-25/ok-boomer-coronavirus-is-turning-millennials-into-socialists)

My favorite part though is:

&gt;Whether Millennials actually use the word “socialism” properly — as government ownership of the means of production — is moot. More likely, they simply want better public policy that addresses their specific problems. Even then, however, they often fall prey to political snake oil such as rent controls or wealth taxes.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The better path for policymakers across the West is to offer more pragmatic, but still sufficiently bold, alternatives**. And as I’ve argued, this means reviving classical liberalism — not in the American sense of “left” but in the European sense of “freedom.”

This is something I've continuously repeated over and over again over the past however many years is pragmatism in our politics. We've gotta stop jerking off these ideologies like ""free market libertarianism, socialism, blah blah blah"" and start actually taking steps that are realistic, have been shown to work in other countries (I loved the fact that the article specifically brought up Germany), and actually improve the lives of citizens. Whatever happened to this country being problem solvers? You don't have to align every policy with whether it promotes socialism or capitalism, or whatever.

European Zionists are indigenous to EUROPE, Ethiopians indigenous to Ethiopia, Yemenis indigenous to Yemen. You cannot claim to be indigenous of a far off land just because your religion mythology has settings in that land thousands of years ago!! (Everybody KNOWS most Zionists were not religious, which is even more delusional). Balinese people in Indonesia practice Hinduism, they are indigenous to Bali and cannot colonize India and claim to be indigenous from there, it’s delusional. A non religious Balines wanting to colonize India is equally delusional. 

Zionists colonizers migrated to Palestine, who was the colonial ruler is IRRELEVANT, zionist colonizers migrated and settled in Palestine. You ignoring the indigenous people in favor of the ruling power IS RACIST!!! 

You obviously have a very obtuse understanding of history You see in the Levant, Canaan, now the land of Palestine, there have been DOZENS of peoples, civilizations and empires, BEFORE AND AFTER your mythology and for longer time. NOT just one. There were many BEFORE Hebrew invasion and many after. Stop being racist supremacist, you are not special, that is NOT HOW HISTORY WORKS, its not that your mythology is the only thing existing thing on the planet. There were many BEFORE the Hebrews (who are UNRELATED to today’s Zionists) and many after, you are NOT special, that is very racist. The indigenous Palestinian people are the result of thousands of years of empires and civilizations living on that land.  Actually, there are beautiful traces of Aramaic (the language that jews used to speak 2000 years ago) in the Palestinian dialect, obvious historical continuity of a people. Hebrew on the other hand, was a dead language for over 2300 years and was reconstructed by German speaking zionists a little over 100 years ago.

Because of your racist colonial epistemology you think that Palestinians are just “Arabs” but you don’t understand how human communities evolve throughout history, the Palestinian People are the result of thousands of years and dozens of rulers over their land, their culture, music, gastronomy, embroidery, dance, LANGUAGE (Levantine dialect) ATTEST for cultural continuity. They are the indigenous people of that area of the Levant, Palestine. I know racists disregard indigenous peoples, so no surprise here that recently arrived Europeans have the delusions of calling themselves indigenous of the land they colonize. 

So yes, colonial settlers arriving to Palestine are settler colonizers. Regardless of any delusional excuse of “having been there thousands of years ago”.

People who had been living there before the colonists arrived are indigenous to that land despite their rulers.
Yes, again you ignore history but what is well documented is that the colonists began the ethnic cleansing. The colonized Palestinian people OBVIOUSLY would resist.

As you keep regurgitating the same Orientalist colonial propaganda WITHOUT EVER quoting any history you clearly need to educate yourself, if you ever what to deconstruct your colonial racism you need to start reading.
Read Israeli philologist Nurit Peled-Elhanan to understand your colonial epistemology; she is Professor at the Hebrew University, daughter of Mati Peled, one of the founders of the State of Israel, and lost her daughter in an attack in Jerusalem, read her, specially “Palestine in Israeli Books: Ideology and Propaganda in Education” (2012) to start off. Read history books, for example excellent Israeli Jewish Historian Ilan Pappe, all his extensive work based on historic evidence, specially ""The ethnic cleansing of Palestine"" (2006) and “Ten Myths about Israel” (2017), read Walid Khalidi “All that Remains: The Palestinian Villages Occupied and Depopulated by Israel in 1948“ (1992), read Jewish historian and Profesor Emeritus at Tel Aviv University Shlomo Sand, mainly ""The Invention of the land of Israel"" (2012) ""The invention of the Jewish People"" (2008) this will help you understand what indigenous people are in the Middle East (Spoiler, yes the Palestinians are!, yes, confirmed by jewish historians!), read Israeli activist Miko Peled (Also Mati Peled’s son) “The General's Son: Journey of an Israeli in Palestine” (2012), Nur Mashalha “Palestine a 4000 year history” (2018), read Edward Said (extensive, very detailed bibliography), start by learning what Orientalism is; read Jewish Linguist Chomsky and his numerous articles and work on the issue of Palestine. Read Iraqi jewish author Naeim Giladi, who was one of the first Mizrahi Zionists, staunch Zionist who migrated to Israel, promoted the colonization and served in wars, he eventually realizes the truth and writes “Ben-Gurion's Scandal: How the Haganah and the Mossad Eliminated Jews” (2003) explaining how the Zionists destroyed Jewery in the Middle East, on this account read about the Lavon Affair as well and about USS Liberty, why not… Read the direct history sources like the IDF Archives, the Hagana Archives; they themselves describe the details of the ethnic cleansing, how they bombed entire villages just to expel the entire Palestinian population forever and take over their land. Read all about Plan Dalet, and how the Zionists meticulously planned the ethnic cleansing, the extermination and destruction of hundreds of Palestinian towns to incept a new state exclusively for immigrants. Read Yale and Oxford Historian Rashid Khalidi, for example “The Hundred Years' War on  Palestine: A History of Settler Colonialism and Resistance, 1917–2017” (2020) to understand the beginning and development of the issue. Read the hundreds of accounts and interviews attesting the ethnic cleansing in places like Palestine Remembered. Read Ben Gurion’s Diaries, VERY IMPORTANT direct history source, read how he explicitly is calling for ethnic cleansing, depopulation, expulsion, and massacres, literally calling for it for decades, BEFORE 1948.

I legitimately don’t understand what you’re asking here. What do you mean when you say these improvements need to be “funded”. Eg. how is it that putting in place a law against child labor needs to be “funded”?

—

Just so we’re on the same page, exploitation in this context is when a worker produces some good for a company and gets paid less than the value of the goods produced, because they do not own the means of production (the company does).

Fundamentally, the capitalist economy is built on this. If you own the means of production, the more you can underpay people (ie. the more extremely you can exploit them) the more profit you stand to gain. The incentive of a company under a capitalist economy is to pay their employees as little as possible and charge as much as possible for their product. That includes things like medicine that people need to take in order not to straight up die :)

Look at the pharma industry in the US, which runs under a more pure capitalist model. Now look at it in Canada, where the government plays a bigger role. Notice the difference in drug prices for the consumers, and the fact that things in the US (spoiler) are fundamentally fucked up on that end. Try and tell me the US isn’t more exploitative here, especially of its consumers. Try me.

Have you experienced the US economy firsthand, especially as a low wage worker? It’s exploitative to the tits. Where I live, people have to sleep in their cars because jobs pay crumbs and housing costs a shit ton of money. Now compare this to a more socialist leaning European country.

That said, I'd still claim that governments, which supposedly forced economies to shut down, did them a favour. Quarantine saved the economies rather than stifled them.

In my country, we sat 2 months out, and now we're consuming even more than before the quarantine. If the quarantine had prolonged, many more businesses would've collapsed, or it would've taken much bigger deficits to cover for the sudden decline of credit flows. As I said, uncertainty is still a driving force. Despite our government being generous to the businesses and those that lost their jobs, credit flows from the banks and other lenders declined by 30%. If the pandemic was still going on, and on the basis of ""hammering out"" every virus hot spot, then the banks would still be more hesitant to lend to businesses in fears that they might become a coronavirus hot spot. 

All these reasons is why the quarantines in Europe saved the economies. Because it was in the interest of the country to shut everything down, but it was in the interest of each individual actor to maintain their levels of production. The quarantine solved this by making everyone sit this one out - because not a single producer would've if they saw  their competitors working.

This last point about individual vs. collective incentives is also why Americans are having so much trouble with it. Many Americans seem to have a very skewed ideal of liberty that dictates that any individual should not be blocked from pursuing his own personal interest under any circumstances, unless it has something to do with patriotism or national security.

[],,ConvenienceStoreDiet,1419125648.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_k8abg,False,False,[],"**Here are some dad-style tips:**

**Dating:** Go for it! Be a gentleman/lady or whatever relevant term works for you. And that doesn't necessarily mean conforming to gender standards. It means be kind, courteous, respectful. The best relationships of your life will feel like you're with your best friend. So treat them well. If you get rejected or don't get what you want, don't be a dick. Don't be vengeful. You'll probably be angry or hurt. It's not always about you or something you did. It's okay if things don't work out. Don't hurt others because of it. Put your time back into school work and hobbies. Respect boundaries. You WILL fuck up in a relationship somehow.

You might be scared to ask someone you like out on a date. Give it a try. If they say no, it'll be one of thousands on your journey. So no big deal. If they say yes, it'll be pretty cool. It's okay if they say yes or no. It's scary to open up. But it's important to respect their decision. Don't be a dick if they say ""no."" You'll want to try and protect yourself from feeling the pain of heartache by maybe lashing out or saying something mean. It's okay to feel that anger or hurt or pain. It's not okay to be a jerk about it. So be cool and move on.

The hard part about relationships is that we're all so unique that you learn through experience. You may discover you don't want one or are asexual or even your preferences or life goals. You discover yourself and how to treat others through the mistakes you make in them.

But go in knowing this. The other person isn't there to fix your problems. They're only there to experience the ride with you. No one owes you sex or their time or attention or anything for that matter. Discuss your boundaries and learn theirs, the other person may not have a clue. One person may think kissing is something you do naturally and spontaneously, the other may feel violated if you don't talk about it beforehand. Everyone is different based on their personalities, experiences, etc. So learn to talk and express your thoughts to someone intimately.

And don't heavily alter your life this early for someone you love. If she doesn't want you to be a doctor because she doesn't want to date a doctor, then she can go find someone who fits her mold. You do your best you. If she wants a baby and you want to study in Europe, go to Europe. You focus on getting your shit together and following your dreams. Your first relationship likely won't last a lifetime. Committing to fix a problem won't fix a problem. Right now, you do you first and get your life in order. Follow your path and know a relationship is best when you both naturally want the same things and work out well together, not force the thing to work. Compromise on the small stuff, but generally don't sacrifice your life goals on the biggest stuff.

And wear a condom ALWAYS when having sex.

**Drugs:** Don't smoke/vape. Don't do drugs. IF you do decide to experiment as an adult, I quote South Park: there's a time and place for everything and it's called ""college."" If you do, treat using as a special occasion or celebration to enhance a moment, not as a way to cope with your emotions. Do it responsibly around friends you trust with safe ways to get home. Limit your use to weekends when you don't have responsibilities. Take care of your shit first and be diligent about it. Don't pressure others to do it to make friends. Let them decide for themselves. Drugs will never make you happy, interesting, likeable, or take away the pain. Explore other options to deal with those. Hobbies. Meditation. Travel. Socializing. Therapy. Pets. And if you do decide to use, every one has its own individual risk factor. Stay the fuck away from anything that's physiologically addictive. Meth, coke, crack, opiates, heroin, nicotine. Your body can recover from a lot of shit, and you'll feel invincible when you're young, but some things are so fucked up you won't see how fucked up they are until it's too late. Trust us on this one and not your friends who tell you, ""yeah, it's just once. I love doing it."" You're too close to the fire at that point to see how big the flames are behind it. Don't let yourself be a statistic with, ""just once."" You don't walk up to a pack of hungry wolves or an angry bear ""just once."" Some things you can learn from experience. I think most people will say, ""you don't need to learn how bad heroin is going to fuck up your life from experience."" You'll have a lot of friends who want you to do drugs with them. It's okay to say no. If you feel pressured but don't want to, just let them know that you don't want to but you still want to be friends or hang out or whatever. It's just not your thing. When you're younger, everyone keeps asking, ""why why why."" Because they're trying to find a commonality you can bond with and haven't seen all the consequences of drugs. But you don't have to do everything everyone else is doing. You can still get along with others and not do exactly what they're doing to fit in. You be you. As you get older, people stop asking about drugs. Because we've all seen our shit, people losing loved ones to addiction, dropping out of school, etc.  and we get the consequences for some. Don't self-medicate with drugs. Smoking cigarettes doesn't ease any pain. If you want to use pot to deal with depression/anxiety/eating, talk with your doctor first. Don't be your own doctor. You have to know your risks first, and your friend's anecdotes won't be enough information. Everyone has a different view about drug use. This'll be your adult choice to make. But make that choice as an adult. Meaning be an adult first. Focus on your school first and taking care of your responsibilities first.

**Drinking:** same advice as above. For me, most of my friends started drinking around senior year. Most people drink. Decide if it's something you want to do if and when it comes up, but focus on your school first and foremost. Most cultures it's a common way of bonding. Alcohol reduces inhibitions, so if you're angry you won't hold back. If you're happy, you might feel happier. It doesn't fix problems or make you interesting. It won't help you cope with problems. It won't get rid of the pain. It only compounds problems. Avoid it on the weekdays. If you do, do it in moderation and make sure you have a safe way to get home. Make a game plan if you decide to drink. Call your parents or Uber if you're drunk and have to get home. Deal with your car the next day. Your parents would rather have you home alive than to have to bury you. You'll lose friends to drunk driving. As in, they will die. We all have. If your buddy's drunk and gets in a car, take his keys, pay for his Uber, do what you have to do. Let them hate you for it. Better they're alive the next day, or the family that dies to a drunk driver is. Be rigid about that. Know your limits, and you don't have to get fucked up when you drink. You can always do just a little if you like. I was never a drinker, but to get people off my back I might fill a beer bottle with water or hold a glass with Sprite and put a toothpick in it so peole thought I was classy.

Treat others well. You're gonna feel angry about a lot of shit. Try not to take it out on the people who are looking out for you.

!) Europe has many key differences than the US. Europe is largely homogeneous relative to the US, western Europe has half the population of the US total, and Europe is not governed the same as the US nor are their citizens guaranteed certain rights like we are in the US via the constitution. Given the massive differences in the US and western Europe, how can you say that their policies would work here and what policies, if any, would you like to see implemented that you believe would be successful.

2) What policies or economic ideologies do you see now that are similar to those leading up to the great depression?

3) What policies would you consider socialist were enacted during and after the great depression that led to the economic boom after WW2? And do you think it was those policies or the fact that US was about the only industrialized country to come out of that war relatively unscathed?

4) What you're talking about sounds more like mob rule than anything. Today I see a large portion of the population being brainwashed and having ideologues shoved down their throats. On both sides. How do you prevent this further and how do you prevent it from dictating the will of the people when it is obvious it is leading the people down a path that is completely disadvantageous for them and the group? Like relinquishing more power to a government or governing body?

5) Is there a necessary evil in any ideology that allows people to be more free or have more Independence and liberty? I see more freedom of choice under capitalism and I see, under capitalism, the greatest incentive for people to utilize this system... which is capital. Let's assume this is true... Human nature makes us inherently selfish to some degree, so how do you incentive production, innovation, research, creation, etc under a socialist ideology where that individual doesn't gain as much from his work or labor or time because it has gone to the group? I am inclined to believe that with limited government intervention or even perhaps some government incentivization, the production, innovation, exploration, and creativeness under capitalism far exceeds that which is capable under socialism because the individuals involved gain capitol from their work and their creations and their innovations AND they benefit the group instead of ONLY being about the group.",True,False,False,,,,0,1596307821,,False,0,{},g00ecdq,False,t3_i1lfh3,False,True,t1_g006qem,/r/usanews/comments/i1lfh3/lapd_releases_video_showing_protester_shot_in/g00ecdq/,False,,1604494338,1,True,False,usanews,t5_2rf3d,r/usanews,public,,0,[],

Jim crow or redlining for example wouldn't fall under the definition of a hate crime. Neither would harsher sentences or rougher police interactions. So I dont think it paints the entire picture here.

I think all of that is a very worthy discussion. But I also think in many ways it highlights the apples to oranges comparison of discrimination each group has faced. Even within subgroups, Japanese-Americans with family who lived through American internment camps went through different experiences than families who migrated there after.

&gt; And I agree with your assessment that a lot of modern anti semitism is born out of a resentment toward the success of others. But that's almost better in a way. Who really hates jews? Poor trailer trash? People who can't act on these feelings in any way besides committing crimes? That might ultimately be an easier deal than being disliked by police and politicians; people who hold real power and influence in our institutions.

I think a lot of people don't know this, but a lot of the perpetrators of these attacks in America today are by blacks and other minority groups. There was an incident in 2019 where two black people shot up a kosher market and killed two Jews in New Jersey. Another one in 2019 where a black guy went into the home of Jews celebrating Chanukah in NYC and stabbed them with a machete. The reason for the spike in these attacks seems likely about socioeconomics, despite them ironically mostly targeting the ultra religious Jews who are generally pretty poor and oftentimes on welfare even.

Then you have the classic alt-right shootings like the Pittsburg synagogue.

In Europe, Jews have it really bad because you get a trifecta of antisemitism coming from extremist Muslims, the alt-right and the far left.

&gt; And to be clear I think ben shapiro cries wolf on this issue as a means to shut down the conversation, but I wouldn't make the that claim about everyone or even you, specifically. You seem to have been totally well reasoned throughout this whole discussion and not arguing from any sort of victimhood Olympics perspective.

There's definitely a lot of danger in having victimhood mentality ingrained into ones pathology. I'm very much against it. I actually got in a debate with a Jewish redditor one time who insisted on being viewed as a ""victim"" in the US, which is obviously absurd. This saddened me to hear, because I think the main driving force for Jewish success is having a positive attitude and trying to succeed as much as possible with whatever options are available, regardless of discrimination, like when they had a Jewish quota in American colleges. Anyone who has a victimhood complex, will likely think the world is rigged against them and not even try to succeed.

I much prefer to talk about the reasons behind the success of Jews, despite historical discrimination, rather than whine about being ""oppressed"" in the most welcoming place for diaspora Jews in the world.",True,False,False,,,,0,1596308321,,False,0,{},g00fcra,False,t3_i1rx29,False,True,t1_g009yy7,/r/samharris/comments/i1rx29/bari_weiss_was_on_bill_maher_last_night_and_yet/g00fcra/,False,,1604494845,2,True,False,samharris,t5_2thqg,r/samharris,public,,0,[],

* March 19, 2002 — Clinton was listed as flying from New York to London and then returning two days later.
* May 22, 2002 — Clinton flew from Japan to Hong Kong.

While there, he [worked](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/directors-forum-bill-clinton) on HIV and AIDS prevention projects, democratization, and economic development. He finished the trip in [England](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/2294147.stm), where he [addressed](https://web.archive.org/web/20021016130247/http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/10/02/clinton.labour/index.html) the [Labour Party](http://www.apimages.com/metadata/Index/Associated-Press-International-News-United-King-/9b441ab099e5da11af9f0014c2589dfb/18/0) during its annual conference. In a [2002 profile](http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/n_7912/) of Epstein, Clinton is quoted as saying through a spokesman, “Jeffrey is both a highly successful financier and a committed philanthropist with a keen sense of global markets and an in-depth knowledge of twenty-first-century science. I especially appreciated his insights and generosity during the recent trip to Africa to work on democratization, empowering the poor, citizen service, and combating HIV/AIDS.” According to the flight records, this was the longest trip Clinton took on Epstein’s plane, and it accounted for 11 of the 26 total flights.
* Nov. 4, 2003 — About a year after the Africa trip, Clinton took what appears to be his last trip on Epstein’s plane. He flew from Brussels to Oslo, where he had a two-day [visit](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/former-us-president-bill-clinton-shakes-hand-with-norwegian-news-photo/2699885?adppopup=true) with officials to [work](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/former-us-president-bill-clinton-talks-during-a-joint-press-news-photo/2697563?adppopup=true) on his project to prevent HIV and AIDS in developing countries.

The winners of the War: Nazi Germany that came to power in 2723 under the rule of  Wilfried Rogge, the Reunited Austro-Hungarian Empire that united under the rule of Oskar Ludwig Hubert Otto in 2728 with the help of the Germans, Nationalist Greece(that formed the Byzantine Empire) under the rule of Kiriakos Gounaropoulos which came to power in 2720, the Japanese empire under the rule of Fukuhara Matsuo and Sweden (that formed the Scandinavian Empire) under the rule of Önde Wahlström.

The Losers of the War: The United Kingdom under the rule of Chester Henderson, France under the rule of Jean-Louis Jacquemin, The Russian Republic (now known as Soviet Russia) that was under the rule of Shishlov Nikodim Rodionovich and now is under the rule of Zhutov Matvey Makarovich, America that was once united and was under the rule of Apollo Mccray, Mexico(now known as the Mexican Socialist States or MSS) that was under the rule of Gonzalo Nuñes and now is under the rule of Frenando Hernandez, Canada that was once united under the rule of Thomas Wilkinson and more countries (too lazy to put them all).

The Aftermath: 1- North American Explosion of Countries

After the Peace Treaty was signed, a lot of people were unhappy and protests started to pop up and the protests hit Canada,USA and Mexico, and Fascists and Communists saw a perfect opportunity to put those ideologies in power so after some time,Revolutions started and in the year 2742,July 25.

* The United States Government fell, leaving Countries to form and those Countries are: The California Republic, Confederacy of (some tribe name,forgot the name),Socialist Tribe Union, Middle East Union, Washington Brotherhood, Alaska State(Fascist Alaska), the Great Lakes Republic,Dakota,New England (and one more but forgot the name) but two small resistance appear and one created the Provisional American Government which is Democratic and formed in the South and the other one created the Fascist Government of America formed in the North;
* The year 2742, July 31, The Canadian Government fell and now there is a Communist Quebec, Canadian State (Fascist Canada) and the Northern District but a small resistance created the Provisional Canadian Government which is Democratic;
* The year 2742 August 3, The Mexican Government fell and now it is a Communist Mexico in the North and the Aztec Empire in the South.

2-South America

* Brazil is divided for the same reason as America and now there is the Monarchist Brazil and the Nationalist Brazil and the Republic of Amazonas/Amazonia;
* Gran Colombia and the Claws Squad- Colombia saw the perfect opportunity to expand and form Gran Colombia while the Majors were distracted and the Claws Squad is an uprising of some Venezuelan Soldiers trying to reconquer there land;
* Argentinian Reich is a Nazi Argentinian State in the South of Argentina and Argentina is now known as Ro de la PLata;
* Paraguay conquer some land when the Countries were distracted;
* Guyana the same as Paraguay;
* Uruguay the same as Paraguay.

3-Central American

* Honduras conquer San Salvador,Guatemala,Nicaragua,Belize and some parts of Mexico and formed the Centro America;
* Panama didn't do anything.

4-Africa

* Europeans colonized again Africa but there are still independent Nations that some formed unions like the East African Union which is Fascist, Western Africa which is Democratic and the Central African Union which is Communist to protect themselves of the Europeans and the ones who didn't unite was South Africa which is Democratic and the Islamic Arabian Union which is Islamic.
* Nazi African Puppets- The Nazis conquer some land and created those Reichkommissariat puppets and the German East Africa

3-4 decent eyepieces can go a long way (Overview, planets, in-between).

E.g. the 6mm, the 25mm kit is okay for an overview, and 1-2 in-between (e.g. the 15mm 66° and 9mm 66° - there's also a set  of 6-9-15-20 but the 20mm would be redundant).

That’s entirely the point. Everyone agrees that’s racist. Tons of people view racism mainly through that lens and other similarly overt forms of racism without any ulterior motive or bad faith. That’s the sort of racism that, like you said, is obvious and easy to identify by pretty much everyone. 

But there are many more forms of racism that aren’t as overt, and they are still horrific and damaging. Those aren’t as easy to see and identify by those who haven’t lived that experience and/or examined its societal impact. 

Bad faith actors also use that limited lens of racism as plausible deniability and use the incredibly high level setting of racism as a starting point for luring people to even more clearly racist ideas and ideologies.

I’m thinking of stuff like the white nationalist movement. They say they aren’t racist. They just want to ensure America maintains the white European culture they say it was founded upon. They say that keeping things racially homogenous makes societies better. They say they don’t have anything against black people and other non-white groups — it’s just humanity’s nature instinct to want to be among their own race. They can live among themselves.

If you believe the bar for what is considered racist to an insanely high bar akin to overt acts like lynching or shouting the n-word at people in public, then these obviously racist white nationalist ideas wouldn’t cross that threshold for you. 

You can truly believe these things and still be convinced you’re not racist. The bad faith actors, meanwhile, can push these ideologies with plausible deniability when called out on their racism and can respond with faux outrage over being called racist. “Why do you call everyone who disagrees with you racist?!!”

The European wakes up eager to start his virtuous European day and immediately a thought pops into his head. AMERICANS. This of course is a daily occurrence without fail.  ""I wonder what those stupid Americans are up to,"" he thinks as he instinctively opens up his favorite American website Reddit from his iPhone. He scrolls and scrolls seeking an opening to talk about America, anything to latch on to. He's totally not obsessed with Americans. He becomes bored so he turns his TV on and opens up Netflix. He puts on his favorite marvel movie for the billionth time and he goes back to scrolling. He loves engaging in American culture as he bashes America. He's totally not obsessed. He gets hungry and reaches for his iphone to order breakfast from McDonalds using uber eats. “Stupid Americans making me eat their shitty food,” he thinks to himself, “European food is so much better not even close.” He has eaten KFC 3 out of the last 5 nights for dinner. He waits downstairs for his food so he decides to put on some American rap music. “Ugh stupid Americans,” he says “their culture is such shit! Not like European culture, we have history! and long-standing traditions. True culture comes from the wealthy!” A Muslim family crosses his path and he pretends to not be afraid and gives them a friendly nod and a wave. “WAAAOOOO” he thinks as he smirks so self-satisfied “I bet if this was America they would have shot them lol.” “Us Europeans are much more open-minded and civilized.” He nods agreeing with himself. His food arrives and makes his way back upstairs as he slurps down the coke Americans have forced him to drink. As he sits down to enjoy his shitty American food his Iphone receives an alert. NEW ZEALAND NOW HAS ZERO CORONAVIRUS CASES! “Oh my fucking god!"" He yells! ""I am so gonna rub this in their stupid American faces!” He tweets, he posts on Instagram. He jumps on Reddit and comments with furor and xenophobia. He never really congratulates New Zealand or their success but instead talks about how Americans will all die from COVID and how they are all so stupid. The European posts charts and graphs he has archived to link when he is questioned. Hes totally not obsessed with America. Dont even joke around like that. Hes cooming with joy. “I really showed those stupid Americans today” he says to himself “they fucking deserve it, god damn imperialists,” he says without a shred of irony. Felling extra good about his exploits he decides to go out and enjoy his blessed, virtuous, pretentious Euroday. He laces up his Jordans nice and tight.

The actual number is hard to get, because incredibly, the US government does not mandate reporting of these statistics, and we have to rely on third party reporting from media sources, which is itself astonishing.

The figure you're citing is the number of fatal police shootings.  This number is an order of magnitude higher on a per-capita basis than any other peer country.  It's not even in the ballpark with any other developed country. It's just astronomically higher than anywhere else.  When you compared it to the UK on a per capita basis, it's ~50x higher.  It's 10x higher any country in Europe, including Russia.  It's simply incomparable with any other democracy anywhere in the world.  Only basket case countries have comparable numbers.  And indeed, on a per-capita basis, it's ~90x higher even than China.

So it's simply incredible to me how deeply people like your will droop to your knees to apologize for this singularly violent police force in the United States.  It is certainly not a small number.

But this actually minimizes the scale of the problem.  The police kill many more people than just those that they shoot to death.   Just as the police murdered George Floyd without shooting him, they kill many others without firearms.  The list of fatal encounters with the police is nearly double the list of fatal shootings - most recently 1,810 in 2019.

And this too is incomparable with anywhere else in the world.  And in this figure, there can be no excuses made about gun laws.  Other countries have criminals too, but somehow these encounters don't result in huge numbers of deaths.

And all of this is just the tip of the iceberg of the problem of policing in the US.  These are just fatal encounters.  There are countless more problematic encounters that don't result in a death.

If the police in the US did a better job at solving crimes, maybe there might be an argument to be made that all of this is somehow worth it.  But they don't.  The clearance rate for violent crime in the US is 45% - far lower than any other developed country.  The US has many more police per capita than Canada, we imprison 5x as many people, yet Canada has a 63% violent crime clearance rate.

The police in the US are not just extraordinarily violent compared to peers, and the US not only imprisons huge numbers of people compared to peers, we also solve far fewer crimes.

So what exactly is it that you're defending?  What is the good thing the police in the US are doing?  And have you ever lived outside of this country?  Because by whatever metric you want to use, policing in the US is simply terrible.

&gt;	Differences in per capita income between the richest and poorest countries were only just above 3 to 1 in 1820 (with income measured in dollars and at constant prices). The gap grew over the 19th century: slowly at first, and then more rapidly until 1913. Inequality between nations continued to grow over the twentieth century, accelerating over the last forty years. The ratio of the average GNP per capita (1987 prices) of the richest countries with a fifth of the world’s population, to the GNP per capita of the poorest countries with a fifth of the world’s population, grew from 30 to 1 in 1960 to 60 to 1 in 1990, and to 74 to 1 at present.

https://www.wider.unu.edu/publication/global-inequality-0

Note how since the 60s, the gap between rich and poor has actually increased quite a lot. (The book *Bad Samaritans* by Ha-Joon Chang is a brilliant read related to this)

Places like India and China actually had higher GDP per capita than countries like Britain and France up to the 18th century. Latin American lost potentially 95% of its indigenous population after European arrival, to both direct genocidal violence and European disease. Mexico didn’t recover to its precolombian population levels until the 1800s. Millions of kilograms of metals were extracted from the region, providing a windfall of capital for Europe to transition to industrial foundations and further trade with Asia (which would eventually outsource Europe’s land and labor intensive production, thus freeing up capital and labor for industrial production). China, given its relatively strong status at the time, turned away a bulk of goods trading, stating they didn’t want British goods. This led to a major trade deficit, where Britain needed Chinese goods, but they had to pay with capital (silver) since China didn’t want their goods.

This not sitting well with the British, as they needed a market for their goods production, they took to selling opium from their colony, India, to China. This kickstarted the Opium Wars, which eventually led to Britain winning and imposing various trade regulations and tariffs, thereby making British goods much more competitive in China, giving them the consumer market they so desired, but as well weakened China’s position (this when China also lost Hong Kong to Britain). The result of these wars would go on to be called the unequal treaties.

This all very shallow, and doesn’t get into Indian colonization, colonization of the Americas, the scramble for Africa, natural resources, geography, institutions, why the industrial revolution was British, etc.

One remarkable quote related to Africa from Cecil Rhodes, a key British colonialist:

&gt;	‘The Empire is a bread and butter question’, Cecil John Rhodes declared in 1895. He had just attended a meeting of the unemployed in the East End of London and his journalist friend, W. T. Stead, recorded his impressions. ‘I listened’, said Rhodes,
to the wild speeches, which were just a cry for ‘bread! bread!’ and on my way home I pondered over the scene and I became more than ever convinced of the importance of imperialism…. My cherished idea is a solution for the social problem, i.e., in order to save the 40,000,000 inhabitants of the United Kingdom from a bloody civil war, we colonial statesmen must acquire new lands to settle the surplus population, to provide new markets for the goods produced in the factories and mines.

I’d definitely recommend everyone check out these books, which together provide a decent framework:

*Why the West Rules for Now* by Ian Morris

*The Divide* by Jason Hickel

*Why Nations Fail* by Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson

Ideally, read all three, as they examine different aspects. 

*Why the West* argues from a more geographical position, and is a long view history (fascinating historical read, explanatory argument aside). Although, it argues geography explains a lot, the history is not all geographical, and is a great world history book

*The Divide* focuses post-1500 and largely post-1800, examining from a more colonialism, imperialism, unequal trade and exploration side. Especially how the structures of that still have influence today. Interesting read for the inadequacies of modern development theories. Fascinating look behind that quote at the start of this comment about how modern gaps between rich and poor countries are growing, and that we are not quite in a “catching up” period like many narratives suggest we are.

*Why Nations Fail* looks more at institutions, and the roles they play. This takes a more political inclusivity point of view, in terms of explanatory power.

All the books discuss the various aspects, but lean a bit more into one side vs the others.",True,False,False,,,,0,1596315901,,1596316340,0,{},g00tw6a,False,t3_i1ttlu,False,False,t1_g0060m8,/r/MapPorn/comments/i1ttlu/thought_this_would_fit_here/g00tw6a/,False,,1604502445,15,False,False,MapPorn,t5_2si92,r/MapPorn,public,,0,[],

Due to this poor degree of containment, the daily deaths in the US is far higher than those of European countries.

But the idea is that fossil fuels need not disappear altogether, because as you said, wind, solar, and some other renewables cannot be used as baseline power sources for extended periods of time.

&gt;Besides, when I made that point, it was in the context of biblical times when it was indeed basically impossible to tell if someone was infertile without sexual intercourse.

And that's part of the problem. Why do we still apply rules that follow the context of times hundreds of years ago? Many of them don't make any sense in modern times. We don't follow the rules of the Old Testament after all, looking at ""wearing clothes of different wools is a sin"" and all that. The only difference is that there's no Jesus nowadays to tell us to disregard those.

&gt;Indeed but it's not like the Polish government is doing that so what's your point? It's not illegal to be gay in Poland, they're just not allowed to marry which is the case in every Central-Eastern European country as far as I know.

Yes, and that's what those people are protesting for.

&gt;Well, no they can't. Laws are man-made, they were written by people like you and I, while the Bible is believed to have divine character, it's the word of God.

To burrow a quote from a great series, ""The Bible isn't an iPhone...anything that can be upgraded eventually ends up in the bin, only to be replaced by a new model. The Bible has endured for a very long time and its value has changed little, if at all.""

But we are not Muslims. We don't believe for the Bible to be the exact word of God. It's a report of events that allegedly happened at that time and a testament of the workings of God and Jesus Christ, but it was still written down by normal people. And just like laws, those words can change their meaning over time. Nothing like that is ever static, the Bible would be a pretty bad book if it couldn't adapt to the different times.

The centaurs are not literally the Ojibwe people for example, but if you accept them as an analogue for First Nation peoples (intentional or not), then it stands to reason that Argo and Fitz do not need to literally have white skin for them to be an analogue of whiteness in the world which has been created.

For me the white coding of Argo and Fitzroy (whether or not they actually have white skin), is that they're operating in a culture which remains analogous to a lot of the structures and values that originated in Europe.  Obviously this world's focus on accounting is significantly more hyperbolic than what we see in our world, but at its core, the dominant culture here is still a pretty straight analogue to white Eurocentric culture.   

Argo and Fitz operate within that cultural demographics and (I may be wrong) we haven't seen any real signals that they have other cultural markers that would separate them.  So while the may not be 'white', they are still filling the role of the 'white' in the white savior narrative.

""Immigration is a public good and the UK should accept more immigrants""

The current leader of the UK labour party has literally called for a reduction in immigration to the UK. Completely false.


On France your statement is generally misleading. First of all France's ""private"" care is NON-PROFIT which makes it radically more progressive than what Biden is suggesting and even then the government pays around 77% of healthcare costs. Secondly the ""Socialist Party"" in France is not actually socialist and not even considered progressive but center-left (although more leftist under previous leader Hamon). Some members of the PS also want to nationalize healthcare and if you look at the actually progressive or leftwing parties so do they

By the way in Scandinavia and other Nordic countries, the UK and Spain (at least these are just the ones I know of. Iirc Portugal+more too) you do NOT have an option. You are FORCED to pay for public health insurance and then you are allowed to by (supplemental) private health insurance on the side. Your statement about both private+public option is VERY wrong.

On to the Spanish Socialist Party. It has more progressive credentials than the French one but generally also only considered center-left with Podemos being the real progressive/left party. I rly hope you are not trying to exploit some people's ignorance of EU politics to show fellow Americans that Biden is progressive compared to European """"progressive"""" parties. It should also be noted that it matters a lot HOW the money is spent as you should know from Trump's corona """"bailouts"""".

And again you misrepresent the policy you mention. The Spanish government is planning a direct investment of 53 billion BUT will generate 200 billion in total investment which is more ambitious than Biden's plan in terms of population and a lot more when accounting for the smaller size of Spain's economy. And that's not even adressing how foolish it is to believe Biden will actually fight for his plan. By the way the Spanish government is doing his after ALREADY phasing out coal and making progress on climate change in general. Once again a lot more progressive than Biden.

And again you lie! In Germany public universities are already tuition free and they have even made it free for foreigners too!!! Largely BECAUSE the Greens AND the SDP pushed for it. And this is even though the German Social-Democrats are known for being even MORE conservative than the French ones even participating in some cuts to the welfare state with the conservative CDU party. If you want a progressive/left party at least use the Greens or even more aptly Die Linke (which is far-left/very progressive).

Lie after lie after lie.

Italy was a good cherry pick for this one being notorious for relatively backwards LGBTQ policy. On LGBTQ+ even most center-right and even many rightwing parties in Western Europe and most centrist parties in Europe as a whole support rights for LGBTQ+ ppl. In Scandinavia/Nordics and most other Western European countries the government (or ""private"" insurance where applicable) pays for sex reassigent surgery. 

Even in Italy which is behind on this issue you can still legally change your gender since 82 and civil unions between same-sex ppl are legal. And they were the 2nd country in the world to elect a trans person to parliament in 06. They are also about to pass anti-discrimination laws even with a more centrist party being the biggest. This is NOT progressive by European standards. This is the lowest bar.

In Sweden the SAP is again pretty centrist but being pro 2-state solution is again an insanely low bar and not  particularly progressive. It is literally official UN policy and every European country has supported it under both left and right governments.

Switzerland is AGAIN a cherry pick being notorious for their relatively very pro gun politics. However once again this is still a bad example!

Switzerland has: Background checks for both weapons and ammunition, weapon registration, magazine caps AND they voted for the EU gun ban which is miles ahead of anything even proposed in the US that I know of. This isn't even in the ballpark of Joe Biden (or Bernie Sanders for that matter). Another rotten cherry/misrepresentation from the bunch.

Even with you cherrypicking you end up mostly lying and then you woefully misrepresent/misunderstand the rest. I rly don't know if it's worse if you're arguing in good faith or in bad faith here and even witht the ridiculous cherry-picking I can't quite tell if you just poorly researched/skimmed old articles/wikipedia from google or not. Either way this might be the worst take or example of an American explaining European politics i have seen to date and in no way did you prove your point (or earn your steaming condecension).

Also the populist right is growing IN SOME COUNTRIES. For an example in Denmark where I'm from the populist right lost over half their support in the last election in 2019 and lost even more since. Saying the far-right is growing ""in Europe"" is definetly an oversimplification. Also most of ur articles are from 16 and outdated. Not to mention you literally have Trump in office in the US.

Joe Biden is not a progressive. He never was, he isn't now and I don't think he ever will be. In Denmark there is not a single party, not even the most extreme rightwing party which is polling to be voted out of parliament next election (barely made 2% of the vote last time), that DOESN'T support fully tax-paid nationalised healthcare. We also not only provide free university but also pay students a wage for going to university. 

Biden literally wouldn't even make it into the most ragingly anti-immigrant, anti-EU anti-almost everything decent party in my country because he is, in fact, SO far right (by our standards) on many issues. I should probably note that despite this I think he is preferable to Trump and would prob vote for him at this point in november if I could. Though your comment is is still a horrible write-up and the Democrats in general are still, mostly, rightwing in Europe, sorry.

It's time to reconsider your views on Europe (and the Democrats it would seem).

Some marginal fractions are doing better: the ultra orthodox get more money to contribute less, and the settlers get more money to cause more instability, and of course, the rich is getting richer. But everyone else is not doing that great. Politically, Israel has been doing very poorly as well—losing much of her unconditional allies in Europe and has been isolated, with growing criticism to Israel’s lack of interest in resolving the Palestinian conflict and refusing to freeze the settlements. Security-wise, you are kind of right, but there is no long term strategy or an effort to find a long lasting solution. I may also add that Israel has never been more socially divided. Netanyahu is ripping the country from the inside, with high levels of reported racist incidents, stronger frictions between orthodox and secular, between various people across the political spectrum, and an ever more marginalized Arab population. In all, the narrative that is painted is not nearly as nice as Netanyahu likes to depict.

There are a number of reasons why people think this way.

The first reason is, FNC and G2 who were head and shoulders above everyone previous years have been slumping. On the other hand, the rest of the league got way, way better so it makes G2 especially look worse than they actually are(FNC is actually bad rn). So they see it as if EU has no good teams right now.

The second reason is, people are less critical of LCK/LPL teams mistakes because simply not many non-fans watch these games, only their niche fans. The good plays get glorified big time especially in the region where ""strongest"" team/teams are, specifically LPL this time.

The third reason is, that some of the fans of LCK/LPL also want to feel superior/hipster by calling the mainstream Western teams garbage and some of the fans of the Western teams who don't have an eye for the game eat this shit up and actually believe it.

Previous years, mostly these have been the reasons for the underrating of the EU teams except for the first reason which is only for this split. Pre-2018 it was understandable because we didn't do much but nowadays it's just funny.

There's like 50+ days until Worlds, G2 have been on an upward spiral these last 2 weeks, Rogue pre-15 mins are actually fucking good, if they shore up their mid-game they will also be very good, MAD are already a very good team and the 4th team, who knows who it'll be, but usually the last seed always gets insanely underrated and they almost always show up at Worlds (G2, Splyce from past 2 years).

Quem sabe ler symbolos e apprende dos simbolos maçonicos sabe que o convento tem algums symbolos usados pelos maçons. Apos saber se foi os maçon que influencaram os templarios ou o contrario isso nao sei.

Para quem nao sabe quem sao os maçons :

Maçons eram pedreiros ou architetos que construisiam cathedrais, igreijas e templos. Os maçons diziam que tinham ums conhecimentos segredos uma Gnosia o Gnosis que se transmitiam pela tradicao oral desde da prehistoria.  Nas tradicoes orais deles eles dizem que a organisacao é muito mais velha que 1717. Os maçons dizem ser os heredeiros de Hiram Abiff o construtor do templo de Deus em jerusalem (templo  de salomao). E que seria maçons do egyptio que construisiram as pyramides e muitos templos antigos no mundo inteiro. O problema é que nao se pode verificar isso tudo nao ha provas reais. Mas agente sabe de fato que eles eram construtores de cathedrais nos tempos medievais e que é possivel que eles construiram conventos e igreijas templares.

em quê acreditem os maçons ? Os maçons acreditem em varias coisas por exemplo : que cada religiao dos tempos antigos no mundo teem uma parte de verdade e que elas todas conteem indiços  para encontrar o criador do universo e para a salvaçao da alma. O numero mais importante deles é o numero 3 a santa trinidade é por isso que a pyramide é o symbolo deles.

O sol e a lua e o olho de ""Deus"" tmb sao.  O sol e a lua  dia e noite, maculino e feminino. Que podem ser connotados com o mundo material e o mundo spiritual. Eles accreditam que todo ser humano teem uma alma immortal divina que o Criador deu a cada homem e mulher. Que devemos fazer boas accoes, viver de forma equilibrada, e ser menos materialistas possiveis para accedir a immortlidade da alma e ajudar os outros a seguir o bom caminho. Para os maçons almas que sao materialistas o que nao atingiram um certo nivel de conhecimento spiritual sao reincarnadas o que é considerado uma maldiçao.  Mas isso depende das lojas e dos maçons ha tmb maçons gnosticos como os cathares que acreditam que ha duas divinidades uma spiritual e de luz e outra malefica material que emprisonou o spiritual dentro do material e que é a origem da reincarnaçao. Os ensinos de Cristo seriam entao a chave da salvaçao para o mundo espiritual. O corpo physico seria obra dessa divinidade malefica e a alma espiritual esteria fechada na prisao material do corpo.

A maçoneria inventou a democracia republicana moderna foram eles que fizeram cair as primeiras monarquias no mundo. Os philosophos Lumière (luz) : Voltaire montesquieux Diderot etc eram a quase todos maçons. A maioria das republicas no mundo existam por causa dos maçons. A republica portuguesa e a revolucao 25 de abril foi em segredo organisada pelo varias organisacoes como a maçonica. Se algum ver à declaracao universal dos direitos humanos que fois realizada apos da revoluçao françesa, ela tem muitos symbolos maçonicos :

Paris é considerada la ville lumière (A cidade Luz) por causa do fato que é a capital maçonica du Mundo. É la que os dejesos duma républicaine baseada sobre os philosophos lumière nasceu. O fato que à tour eiffel é uma pyramide nao é hasar o architecto era maçon :

https://www.google.ch/amp/s/amp.lefigaro.fr/culture/2012/07/20/03004-20120720ARTFIG00279-paris-capitale-maconnique.php 

A maioria dos monumentos em Paris sao Obras maçonicas : Durante a primeira republica 50% dos homems politicos do governo portugues eram maçons :    [https://www.rlmad.net/secmaconaria/pranchas/breve-historial/](https://www.rlmad.net/secmaconaria/pranchas/breve-historial/) . Hoje em dia em muitos governos republicanos eles teem ainda muita influenca e poder. Mas quem é rational o sabe bem a governanca republicana nao é realmente uma democracia é uma forma de oligarchia elitica que é promovida pela democracia popular a eleitores : elites escolhidas pelo partidas. O unico verdadeiro systema democratico é o systema suiço onde o povo decide mesmo de tudo. Pode mudificar leis ou criar novas leis com 100’000 assinaturas.

O grande problema com a maçoneria e a igreija catholica era o fato que para os Maçons a salvacao nao passava pela figura de Cristo mas pelo si mesmo. E muitos maçons nao accreditam na divinidade de cristo, Mesmo se existe maçons catholicos ha maçons judeus, hindus, boudhistas, muçulmanos, etc  é por isso que a igreija catholica considera os ensinos maçonicos incompativeis com os catholicos. Outro problema é que os maçons usam symbolos controversais como o pentagram inversado que na tradicao catholica e considerada como o symbolo do diabo. Um grande problema é o fato que o symbolo da masonaria é um triangulo equilateral que tem 3 angulos de 60 degraus ora com 60+60+60 muitos pensaram em 666. mas o mais grande problema é que os maçons sao pessoas com poder e dinheiro e que eles teem muita influença no mundo politico o que pode parecer perigoso. Eles teem uma tradicao que lhe diz que ajudar um maçon e mais importante que tudo mesmo se for contra as leis que nao forem maçonicas. Exemplo do problema durao Baroso é maçon ele ja o disse varias vezes muitos membros politicos sao outro exemplo é que approximativemente 30% dos deputados europeus sao maçons.

A coisa mais controversada e que é mesmo fato historico e nao pura invençao (Na villa nova de Ourem algums velhotes ainda se lembram dessa historia que os pais deles lhe contaram) é o fato que apos dos acontecimentos do milagre de fatima os carbonarios portugueses (maçons) dinamitaram a primeira capela do sitio sagrado e cortaram o tronco da azinheira das aparicoes e fizeram um cortegio come ele. é por isso que nao ha mais azinheira das apparicoes hoje. Depois ouve pessoas que cortaram pedacos do resto do tronco para levar peças da arvore come eles. Eles que consideravam partes d'um evento santissimo e magico. tudo é contado aqui :

Quem sabe ler os symbolos maçonicos e os apprende e que ja tem uma grande cultural geral nunca mais vai ver o Mundo da mesma maneira. O que pode ser mesmo um perigo para as pessoas com fraca mente que podem acabar em depressao. 

Apprender esses conhecimentos occultos sao um choque psychologico para cada homem : com e sem fê. Porque depois uma Pessoa raçional compriende que fatos historicos ensinados e attestados nao sao bem como sao contados e ensinados.

Um exemplo disso é que à revoluçao communista de Lenine e dos bolschevicos tem originem maçonica o que nao é contado nos ensinos academicos de historia. Esse professor de historia Phd no USA conta isso tudo ai : 

https://www.thegreatcoursesdaily.com/what-role-did-freemasons-and-bolsheviks-play-in-the-russian-revolution/

Eu nao aconselho ninguem a os apprender. Eu apprendi pelo simples curiosidade porque me interessei a problematica templaria e a ordem de cristo em Portugal. As vezes me digo que essa curiosidade nao foi Nada boa porque uma pessoa vai apprender que o Mundo que ela pensava conhecer nao é Nada do que ela pensava.

Quem sabe ler os symbolos maçonicos e vê o santuario de fatima desde da vista satelite ao ceu vai compreender que a igreija catholica romana nao é o que ela pretende ser... e quem vai comprender que seja agnostico ó religioso vai ter um choque. 

Algums Maçons dizem que a ordem do templo e muitos ordems militares catholicos fazem parte deles :

Onde esta a verdade ? quem sabe...

Mas nao aconselho ninguem entrar num desses grupos occultos. Cada um pode accreditar em o que ele quizer e deve ser uma liberdade fundamental.

The Spaniards spoke of ""vineyards"" referring to plantings of the maguey (agave) plant from which pulque is made. And various sorts of ""wine"" were described by the early Europeans in Mesoamerica: one from bananas in eighteenth-century Guatemala, another from pineapples in the West Indies, palm wine from the coyol palm trunk (manufactured from Veracruz to Costa Rica), and the balche of the Mayan area, made from a fermented tree bark.

But it is stretching the truth. The scientific reasoning behind the theory is strong and is based on techniques that have been demonstrated to work on more recent, better documented languages.

He often brings home really big carps, catfishes, pikes and sanders. Nevertheless, what I liked the most were the carps, the golden giants.

A year ago, I was at home, jerking off to some porn when I heard my dad outside, joyfully coming home with his friends. I quickly turned porn off and turned Skyrim on. My father's squad came in, I left my computer to greet them and then I saw that my father was holding a trophy of a 9-kilogram carp. I shared his triumph. Dad left the carp at home and went to the bar with his friends. I stayed at home alone and I decided to have a better look at the carp.

It was still alive and was moving its giant mouth. I imagined, idk why, that carp blowing me. Then I felt an erection. I think you can already guess what I did, I fucked the carp in its mouth with remarkably meaty lips, and I came right into its mouth. Doing so, I felt an extraordinary pleasure.

I forgot about this case later, especially since my father sold that carp at the market. However, when my father was bringing small carps weighing a kilogram or two, I started fucking them, too. I fucked carps and European carps all year long, and fucking smaller carps felt better because their mouths fitted my dick precisely. I loved fucking them while they were still alive, moving their lips around my cock. Over the span of half a year, I fucked, probably, more than 40, maybe even 50 carps. I fucked them several times a day, nutted into their assholes, idk why, sometimes I fucked them again when they were already frozen in a refrigerator, but that was for a rainy day. I even tried to fuck a bream once but its mouth was too small. I fucked a chub once, but still, the carps were the best for me, and whenever my father asked me what he should aim to catch tomorrow, I convinced him to get carps, allegedly because their meat tastes very good.

Here's what happened next. My father hadn't been fishing carps for a week. I hadn't been fucking carps for a week. I was walking in a daze, I really wanted to fuck a new fish, I thought about catching a carp myself but I was too lazy and furthermore, I hate fishing. My father only brought one small pike over the span of the week, probably because it was late Fall and he said that it wasn't interesting to catch carps at that time or something. I remember him seemingly starting to suspect something about my carp-mania by I was talking my way out as if I just liked the taste of it and that was it.

My father brought home an 8-kilogram catfish. I really wanted to fuck with a fish and so I started considering that catfish. Why not, its mouth was fine, except for the teeth, but it generally couldn't do anything, only scratch if you strongly press against it, tops. I thought that that would do it. I got my dick exposed, jerked it a little and put in the mouth of the catfish still alive, which by the way was in a bowl of water, and started fucking it. I fucked it for a little more but after a minute, a terrible thing happened. The catfish squeezed my cock and seemingly tried to rip it off, but didn't manage to, it just swiped its teeth against my dick really hardly. I pulled it out immediately, it was all scratched badly as fuck, it was bleeding, I hit the catfish with my leg and it fell in the bowl of water. Blood was streaming from my dick. I fucking bandaged it, put spirit on it. Then I wiped the blood off from the floor. The dick was aching really badly. It swelled up, but later it healed up, some scars were left though. It was a good thing that nobody found out that I fucked fish and had a bandage on my dick. So, my dick healed up completely after a month. I haven't fucked anything through the whole winter and then in Spring my father started bringing carps from fishing again, and I started fucking them again. I fucked the last carp two days ago. Top of that, boobs and generally girls don't turn me on anymore, but I get hard instantly whenever I see a carp's face.

Something I'd like to generally point out on this front is that there is basically no ""active"" equivalent to stealth. The problem is that the way you'd do it is to destructively interfere with the radar waves incident on the aircraft, which would then require two key things:

* The ability to communicate faster than the speed of light. In order to be able to create the destructively interfering wave exactly 180 degrees out of phase, you need to know what the incident wave is and emit the interfering wave at exactly the time it is incident with the aircraft. Since having to wait until after incidence would mean that you are out of phase with the new incident wave, this requires FTL to do.

   Notably, you do have to (against a modern radar threat) constantly be observing the new waveform, as modern radars rapidly and randomly vary the frequency, phase, and amplitude of the emitted radiation, and getting the jamming frequency wrong would fail to interfere and would instead make you show up extremely clearly.
* The ability to emit the interfering wave over the entire skin of the aircraft. Since the incident waveform reflects off of all parts of the aircraft, to interfere with it destructively you need to emit the jamming signal from every part of the airframe. While not as major of an issue as the requirement for FTL communications, this does require that the entire outside of the aircraft be made out of transmit modules, which is difficult from an engineering point of view.

If you're not talking about ""active"" stealth or cancellation, then we can't make a meaningful comparison between European and American systems. Both the US and European platforms offer sophisticated DECM packages, with the US arguably having a better OECM offering, with the key differentiation being in software and details of the RF architecture that are not publicly revealed. For example, the F-35 carries the ASQ-239 ESM system and the APG-81 is widely thought to contain substantial ECM capability organic to the system. However, beyond these wide strokes, we have no real way of knowing what the system is or what it does, so all we can realistically say is that both US and European platforms have ECM/ECCM/ESM packages available to them.",True,False,False,,,,0,1596326437,,False,0,{},g01c07o,False,t3_i1kz9c,False,False,t1_g017md4,/r/LessCredibleDefence/comments/i1kz9c/deadline_to_submit_bids_to_build_canadas_next/g01c07o/,False,,1604512419,3,True,False,LessCredibleDefence,t5_2yyyd,r/LessCredibleDefence,public,,0,[],

It's gone downhill in the last few years with Brexit and that caused a lot of division but I definitely think things are gonna get back to normal soon. Most people think that the UK is all white by it's not. There is a huge asian and black influence. Some of the most popular music is black and food is asian. Places like london are very very diverse to the point you wouldn't know where in the world you were if you dropped there. It is also made more complex by the amount of European immigrants who bring their own culture so 'white people' arent one big group here. You have the english, the Scottish, the Welsh, the french, the spanish, the polish, the Italians, the Greeks....... who for the most part see themselves as their own ethnicity plus British. We all embrace our own culture as well as feeling we are brits.
