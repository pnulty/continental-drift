&gt;this just leaves me more confused on how these people came to develop these languages in isolation

They weren't developed in isolation, the article says this:

&gt;*We are very confident that Nobiin (and later Dongolawi) came to the Nile from a centre of dispersion in Darfur-Kordofan which they occupied and controlled for perhaps 4000 years. We  know that there were Nubian speakers on the Nile at least as  early as the 500s CE  and probably much earlier. The fact that the Hill  Nubian languages have words  for the days of the week dating back to  Christian Nubian indicates that these  languages were in contact at  least during the Christian Nubian period which  probably covers 500 CE -  1400 CE. This does not necessarily mean that the Hill  Nubians did more  than expand from central Kordofan into the Nuba Mountains during the  period of Nubian  political dominance from Aswan to Kosti (at least).  But given the  location of the Hill Nubian speakers (Dair, Dilling,  Karko etc) along the NE  edge of the Mountains it appears that they were  ""incomers"" settling  among the existing Nyima and Temein groups who  were there before them.*

In other words: the Nubian languages likely don't originate from the Nile, but rather some place in Darfur-Kordofan (which makes a lot of sense, seeing that the Nubian langauges are the only Nilo-Saharan languages in a region dominated by Afroasiatic languages). Hill Nubian speakers are likely immigrants from a Nubian kingdom, but the idea that they migrated during the fall of Christian Nubia is unsupported by evidence.

**Edit:** As far as maintaining similarity with Nile Nubian, that's not particularly uncommon or odd. Numbers and common words usually tend to remain very close across related languages even if they split a long time ago. I'd look at the Indo-European vocabulary page on Wikipedia for examples of this.

This also shows that not all Nuba have links to the Nubians, and in the case of this article, the argument is that most Nuba don't.",True,False,False,,,,0,1596240087,,1596240867,0,{},fzxn81c,True,t3_i0hdpx,False,True,t1_fzxmcjm,/r/Sudan/comments/i0hdpx/history_of_the_nuba_article_breaking_down_the/fzxn81c/,False,,1604445281,1,True,False,Sudan,t5_2qvpt,r/Sudan,public,,0,[],

Wagner then wrote ""Jewishness in Music"" in 1850 which is essentially an anti-semitic rant directed at Meyerbeer (and Felix Mendelssohn too) for saying that Jews control the music ""industry"".

Rawanda: the majority Hutu population slaughtered the minority Tutsi population in a brutality that the world had never seen before
Iran: The Islamic majority decided that all other minorities were inferior, killing them, plundering their land and all sorts of other vile things

If the government is small enough it doesn't have any leverage thus removing the incentive behind lobbies. Political leverage would not get them anywhere you'd have a third party private company auditing. The contract runs out, if they fuck up their name in the market would be tarnished and the contract would not be renewed. That does not mean that noone would do it: there's no such thing as a perfect system, but it's better than the government funded police we have now.

&gt;Europe style healthcare functions much better than American style healthcare to my knowledge.

It's cheaper, not better. Anyone that wants to get grade A care and doesn't care about money travels to the US. Now why is the US's system so expensive? Government intervention again. Through the government's involvement in healthcare, insurance companies found a loophole (a leverage), and started lobbying for their interests which made the prices soar. The solution to that is not more government intervention, that would be like throwing gasoline into a fire. The solution is less government.

&gt;Yes, but is can you trust people to look after their retirement which will take place in 30 years? It will become a burden on the state either way if you don't guarantee a retirement pension.

If people know they have to be taking care of themselves, they would save more. That same money the government takes as taxes would be used as retirement fund. Don't forget that we pay taxes in many different ways. The loans Lebanon takes, the devaluation of the currency, all of these are forms of taxation.

Edit: also charities and private donations play a big role here. Lebanese people have been using that for a while now. 

&gt;Without an army with compulsory taxation for its benefit, you risk losing the free market. Also remember Lebanon is in the Near East, not Europe.

If the Lebanese people want an army, they can fund it without coercion. We all buy health insurance.

&gt;How would it go about earning without taxation or state property?

Just like any other business. The government can compete in the free market. If it needs to make money, let it provide a service that is better than what the other competitors are offering and it'd earn it.

I lived in Ethiopia for a few years, out in the bush for the most part but came through Addis a lot. Nice things about Addis: the nightlife, the downtown (once or twice), Entoto if it’s a nice day and if you don’t get robbed. The food is amazing in Addis, the best coffee of your life you can get at Tomoka... but that’s about it. 

The downsides of Addis: it’s a big city, it’s had rapid development mostly by Chinese companies. Everything is under construction. The roads have potholes which will swallow the 1960s era little tin can cars that they use for taxis. The nice part of town largely has no streetlights and you may also encounter goat carcasses because people in the cities still own and butcher livestock. 

If you want to have a relaxing atmosphere without being hassled by people and eat food you think you won’t get food poisoning from, you end up sooner or later in one of the big hotels, which are, for local standards, quite luxury. The mid-range, 3 star hotel I usually stay at, costs 90 USD per night and if you are lucky all of the parts of the bathroom actually work. The discrepancy of conditions means that you might be super happy with a mediocre Sheraton.

It has amazing food and amazing coffee and a flavor of Orthodox and Catholic Christianity that seem to be like nowhere else in the world. They use different ways of telling time and a different calendar (there are 13 months, New Years is in September), the people are incredibly kind and friendly.

As of the Obama admin, any time a captured illegal firearm was thought to be of US origin, the Mexican authorities would request help from the US ATF to help trace it. Only around 25% of confiscated guns were even suspected, and of those 48% could be confirmed. Overall, less than 12% of recovered illegal firearms in Mexico were able to be traced to the US.

The vast majority of illegal guns in the hands of the cartels, specifically, are bought on the international arms black market (via the same channels used to obtain industrial quantities of precursor chemicals - namely China), or stolen from Mexican police or military. And while it's true that the Mexican government originally sourced a significant portion of these firearms from US arms manufacturers, this is a completely separate issue from civilian gun sales (and more importantly, if the US created an arms embargo on Mexico - they'd just sources their guns from one of the dozens of other major arms manufacturing countries).

The (outright false) idea that the US is somehow responsible for ""most"" guns in Mexico came from a misleading / misquoted figure from a Bush-era Congressional testimony from an AD with the ATF - saying, in regard to specific smuggling operations within the US, that 90% of the firearms involved in arms crossing the US border destined for Mexico, were sourced in the US. Which is a bit like hearing ""most cars shipped from the US to Europe are American made"", but twisting it into ""most cars in the EU are American made"".

As of the Obama admin, the AFT maintained that civilian straw purchases in the US contribute a ""significant"" amount of firearms to the Mexican black market - but it's not clear what ""significant"" means (and whether that is referring to a portion of the 12% above, or some higher figure). In any case, vague references like this should be taken with a grain of salt from the ATF of the era (the admin was pushing heavily for gun control but couldn't pass legislation, so they relied on executive influence to make a difference via the ATF).

 t's really hard for me to talk to JQ people. Gonna engage in good faith for at least one more comment, but I can't reason you out of something you didn't reason yourself into. I've never seen a JQer who's reasoned themselves into their political ideology.

&gt;You're conflating different ideologies. 

I'm not saying these ideologies are the same. I'm saying that if a nation intentionally tries to indocrinates it's youth, it will be wildly successful in doing so - unless there's something preventing it from happening. 

America isn't widely successful. It's not intentionally indocrinating it's youth. 

&gt; Consider that the white Europeans who founded and maintained the nation are now barely half of it today.

You've given me no proof that indocrinating is happening. This link is a non sequitur. Changing  racial makeup ≠ socialist indocrinating.

&gt; In America, it's about subverting sovereignty and destroying homogeneity so that the rulers, often Jews, will not be expelled from a 110th region.

This is equivocation.

Earlier I falsely assumed you meant **socialist** indoctrination. Now you've said that this is about racial makeup. Socialism is an economic ideology. It has nothing to do with racial homogenity.

It seems like you're really worried about pro diversity indocrination, or something else entirely. We can switch to that if you like, but at that point we're no longer socialist indocrination.

Right idea, wrong argument.

In my opinion, your friend is both begging the question and oversimplifying.

First he is assuming that those people who refuse to wear masks during the SARS CoV-2 pandemic believe that wearing a mask furthers the nation and its people, but they simply so not want to be inconvenienced.

That is certainly not the case. They believe that mask use undermines the nation and its people. They believe it infringes on the principles (freedoms) that this country was based upon. They actually believe they are defending those very principles.
In fact, When push comes to shove, many would sacrifice health and safety to defend those principles from  social distancing, emergency measures, and mandatory masks. 

From that perspective, a strong argument could be made in the exact opposite direction: protecting one’s health and safety at the expense of one’s way of life is the furthest possible thing from sacrificing one’s health and safety to defend the abstract principle of nation, as many did in WWI.

Lastly, for the argument to work, you would have to buy into both questions being begged. Not just that the mask advances the principles of the nation and its people (I actually believe it does), but that the drafting of young men to be used as straw dogs in the death rattle of the last true European empires (to say nothing of the European aristocracy) is fucking madness!! These were not “The Germans” you were looking for- that’s WWII. 

Lest we never forget... 

Mask deniers are fools, but that doesn’t mean we should devolve to hyperbole and unreflective rhetoric.

The Magna Carta in 1215 essentially held the Monarchy accountable to the law. The Queen plays more of a ceremonial role as head of state and has to remain apolitical. The current Queen has a great deal of respect by the majority of the general public in the four CANZUK countries, she may have essentially been born into the role but she has done a substantial amount of good work during her reign which is the reason she has such public respect. The monarchy is a symbol but not a defining feature of the relations between the four countries. 

The people to people links are immensely strong between the four countries. ""**The United Kingdom is one of our most like-minded partners in the world. Australia and the UK have a significant and comprehensive relationship underpinned by our shared heritage, common values, strong people-to-people links, closely aligned strategic outlook and interests and substantial trade and investment links. We are frequent dialogue partners at the highest levels across government and are like‑minded on global issues such as international security, multilateral cooperation and economic issues on the G20 agenda.""**

Australia is the number 1 country of British emigration and it has more Brits in it than the entire EU27. Likewise the UK is the number 1 country Australians emigrate to. This is of course without a formal immigration agreement in place. The four CANZUK countries have a common language, similar common law political systems, similar food standards, similar healthcare systems, similar human rights, similar freedoms, similar standards of living. Once mutual recognition of professional qualifications and other similar frameworks are in place, there will probably be even more people going back and forth between the four countries. Already CANZ, Singapore, Japan and South Korean passports have been added to UK egates:

b) The UK government (and any future UK government led by any other political party) should actively be looking at new trade deals and improving existing trade deals all the time. It is in part the entire point of Brexit. Canada, Australia and New Zealand are countries that the UK in particular has a better relationship with than the rest of the countries in the EU do. As a result it has taken 7 years for Canada to negotiate a FTA with the EU, this FTA was done with a lot of help from the UK which was a member state of the EU when it was negotiated. Australia and New Zealand have never negotiated a FTA with the EU, due to disputes with other EU member states much to the UK's frustration. The UK despite the restrictions, tariffs and quotas imposed on it by EU membership has roughly about half its trade outside the EU27. Trade outside the EU is growing faster than trade in the EU particularly in the Asia-Pacific region but also North and South America. The UK will join the the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) which includes Australia, Japan, New Zealand and Singapore, as well as in Latin America and with Canada. Trade negotiations have been occurring with Japan who in particularly wanted to negotiate a trade deal with the UK before agreeing to allow it succession into CPTPP:

There is also a trade deal being negotiated with the USA however right now the USA is more focused on the November election. I suspect the FTA will be worked on in more depth mid November to December:

Continuity agreements have been signed with countries that had a trade agreement with the UK when it was part of the EU. These will likely be looked at again in the future in order to get a better deal specific to the UK and each respective country bilaterally:

OTC markets are also a little tricky because fees are sometimes charged there as well but not always. It’s hard to answer for sure since it varies from brokerage to brokerage.

China itself was still undergoing its century of almost nonstop warfare and Beijing, the city he visited, was brutally sacked by the 8 nation alliance just 2 decades prior. It was a pitiful sight for sure and this European man, young and no doubt full of arrogance, could not help but follow the vogue opinion of the times in that the world outside of the European Mainland and America, was nothing but barbarism and savagery.

There are other issues, though. The tribunal is made of people who are part of a community that is arguably becoming  more toxic over time. Consider how judgements change as the community becomes more and more toxic. Jurors may become more likely to assume the reported player is malicious, resulting in more negative judgements.

Also consider how the perceptions of the community can change over time. For example, there's a popular joke/meme among the League community about Yasuo players (I'm sure you're familiar). How does that seemingly harmless joke affect how tribunal jurors judge reported players who happen to be Yasuo mains?

Another problem to consider is regional differences. For example, when the tribunal was active in South Korea it punished players less for harassment and more for types of toxicity that affected the outcome of the match directly (e.g. feeding) compared to the US and EU. This might not seem like a problem to some people, but it could very well conflict with Riot's intentions for the tribunal (a statement which could apply to the entire tribunal system in general) and allow certain types of toxic behavior to flourish in some regions.

Yet another downside is how ineffective the tribunal is versus automated systems from a psychology perspective. Humans and other animals respond much more significantly to punishment/feedback when the time interval between their action and their consequences is small. Automated systems can provide that consequence in minutes, while the tribunal takes days or weeks. By that time, players might not even remember what got them reported in the first place, and they're much less likely to become ""reformed"" that way.

Couple of little additions/comments etc., that might help.

- Powerpoints: These are officially referred to as socket outlets in the standards, however in general parlance are usually referred to as GPOs (at least in my part of Australia)

- 413 Plug: You may also hear these referred to as surface sockets or plug bases. Also used in similar applications are quick connect sockets, which terminate by displacing the inner insulation similar to a data punch down, and only require the outer sheath to be removed.

- RCDs (GFCIs): We generally use the term RCD to refer to the device even though most commonly RCBOs are now used. RCDs are also (almost) always located in the switchboard, and only ever found in the field or incorporated into outlets in special purpose applications.

- Colour codes: Our standards are derivative of UK/European standards and there has been some attempt to harmonise them. While our standard installation colours are red/white/blue/black, our appliances use European colours (brown active, light blue neutral, etc.)

- Asbestos: Asbestos was not banned from use in commercial buildings until 2005, although it was heavily phased out prior to that. 

- A note on the white card: in some states it is mandatory on all commercial sites, there is also a supplementary asbestos awareness card. Many sites will not accept cards received from online courses, only from RTOs with a face to face delivery. Don't get scammed paying for a cheap card.

Lingo: 

- ""The C Word"": Context and tone are everything here. The same phrase could be meant as either an insult or endearingly. Also, casual use of the word cunt is much more common amongst tradies, working class, and lower socio economic groups. Much less common to hear it in casual conversation in an office environment, the university educated, or similar.
- Smoko: Surprised you missed this. If tradie is a culture, then smoko is a religion. (It's a mid morning break, usually 10-20 minutes, time enough for a quick coffee and breakfast). It's not actually/no longer a smoke break despite the name.
- Builder: Generally when someone refers to the builder they are talking about the principal contractor on a site.

Looks like they're doing by far the worst of any Nordic nation, and they have one of the highest death rates (per capita) of any European nation.

[The man who conceived and implemented the plan, Anders Tegnell has admitted that ""too many have died.""](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52903717) He's also quoted as saying:

&gt;""If we were to encounter the same disease again, knowing exactly what we know about it today, I think we would settle on doing something in between what Sweden did and what the rest of the world has done.""

Also, while the government didn't enforce social distancing, they did recommend it, and they banned gatherings of more than 50 people. They also recommended for avoiding long trips and public transport, and many companies have switched to working from home.


Also, the Swedish people **are** following social distancing guidelines, without having to be told so by their government, because they're (mostly) not assholes:

&gt; Anders Tegnell says his modelling indicates that, on average, Swedes have around 30% of the social interactions they did prior to the pandemic.

&gt; And a survey released this week by Sweden's Civil Contingencies Agency suggests 87% of the population are continuing to follow social distancing recommendations to the same extent as they were one or two weeks earlier, up from 82% a month ago. 

So, in summary: They did a lot more than people think, and they still have more dead bodies per capita than almost any other EU nation.

the national banks in the US during the panic of 1907 were less centralized than the fed, and it would've been worse under the fed.

nelson aldrich and new yorks banking elite had direct ties to european central bankers. it was in their best interest to create the fed, not the citizens.

Probably is a cultural barrier as an expat, but behaving as I'd normally do with a doctor results in them being dismissive, and being very direct results in them thinking I'm a rude foreigner that doesn't want to follow their rules.

I cite wikipedia if you don't trust that source then this breaks down, take care :).

Now, because they have had to endure this and fight for their lives, freedom from slavery, and to be seen as an equal person it's pointed out the inequality. Part of the effort to fix this inequality is encouraging pride in being black.

&gt;The US pays more than the UK per capita for healthcare. Socialised medicine costs less and works better.

US healthcare has problems beyond free market capitalism,  but the point was UK's healthcare will be more and more strained as the median citizen will be 53 years old in 2050. I hope I don't have to show you why elderly people require more healthcare than young people. We're going to have a huge problem with an ever increasing need to spend more on pensions and healthcare while the number of young people, as a percentage of the whole population is declining.  We can talk all day about whether welfare helps people using data from 1950-2020 but my worry is once the conditions change (negative population growth, aging population) it seems to me to be logical that states who depend on tax revenue to fund these programs will struggle to pay for these programs as the number of people on welfare will continue to rise, perhaps indefiitely for the time being.

&gt;I think you’re confused. The point I was responding to was the idea that more welfare would cause reduced tax revenue (presumably through lower employment or whatever). The empirical evidence on the topic is pretty clear, though, that the increased economic activity etc from welfare means that welfare actually increases tax revenue

We're talking about welfare in the past. My whole point was how sustainable is it given the changing conditions we are seeing right now.

&gt;The policies of the Nordics are really just orthodox Keynesianism: 

Keynesianism would have us borrow today to spend our way out of a crisis, acummulate debt which we ideally repay during boom times. Given the problem outlined above, the said states will have to borrow to pay the pensions today and borrow a year from now and 10 years from now until wait, are we ever paying this back? 

&gt;Everyone always tries to come up with excuses why the high tax &amp; Hugh welfare system that works in Norway etc wouldn’t work elsewhere

Because Norway has a trillion dollar resource offshore to fund it's welfare. It also has a population of only 5 million meaning the per capita the oil and oil investment is worth about $200k. It would be conceivable for norway to build every one of her citizens a house without having to raise a single tax. ""Look at norway! They can build a house for everyone, eliminate homelessness *and* are not broke!"" It's disingenuine. If you want welfare you first need to create wealth to distribute it.  Sweden had that experience in the 1970s and 1980s, which is why it's one of the most vocal country about the need for free market and free trade. What policy did Norway enact that helped it collect huge revenues that it could then spend on welfare?

Italy is the typical example of a country that simply cannot follow the Nordic model, because it's conditions and position is different. Of course Italy can mirrow Sweden to some degree, promote free capitalism etc but its population (62m) and natural resources do not allow for it to be like Norway.

*""countries with higher 
percentage of foreign-born population also have more restricted uptake of benefits by migrants""*

*""There is substantial support for ethnic competition theory and hypothesis 1a, higher ethnic diversity leading to more restrictive generosity, by different proxies""*

*""The data further suggests that countries where low skilled migrants make up more than 30% of all migrants are less generous than countries with smaller percentage of low skilled migrants when considering access to unemployment and medical care benefits.""*

Makes sense, because to run a welfare state you need high level of societal trust and honesty. Immigrants are seen as breaking this cohesion creating ethnic competition

All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre: Pope and Tsar, Metternich and Guizot, French Radicals and German police-spies.
Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as communistic by its opponents in power? Where is the opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach of communism, against the more advanced opposition parties, as well as against its reactionary adversaries?
Two things result from this fact:
I. Communism is already acknowledged by all European powers to be itself a power.
II. It is high time that Communists should openly, in the face of the whole world, publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the Spectre of Communism with a manifesto of the party itself.
To this end, Communists of various nationalities have assembled in London and sketched the following manifesto, to be published in the English, French, German, Italian, Flemish and Danish languages.
I. Bourgeois and Proletarians*
The history of all hitherto existing society† is the history of class struggles.
Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master‡ and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.
In the earlier epochs of history, we find almost everywhere a complicated arrangement of society into various orders, a manifold gradation of social rank. In ancient Rome we have patricians, knights, plebeians, slaves; in the Middle Ages, feudal lords, vassals, guild-masters, journeymen, apprentices, serfs; in almost all of these classes, again, subordinate gradations.
The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones.
* By bourgeoisie is meant the class of modern capitalists, owners of the means of social production and employers of wage labour. By proletariat, the class of modern wage labourers who, having no means of production of their own, are reduced to selling their labour power in order to live. [Engels, 1888 English edition]
† That is, all written history. In 1847, the pre-history of society, the social organisation existing previous to recorded history, all but unknown. Since then, August von Haxthausen (1792-1866) discovered common ownership of land in Russia, Georg Ludwig von Maurer proved it to be the social foundation from which all Teutonic races started in history, and, by and by, village communities were found to be, or to have been, the primitive form of society everywhere from India to Ireland. The inner organisation of this primitive communistic society was laid bare, in its typical form, by Lewis Henry Morgan's (1818-1861) crowning discovery of the true nature of the gens and its relation to the tribe. With the dissolution of the primeval communities, society begins to be differentiated into separate and finally antagonistic classes. I have attempted to retrace this dissolution in The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State, second edition, Stuttgart, 1886.

Awesome! By learning even just a tiny bit of Hieroglypic you will get a unique insight into Egyptian thought and religion. I forgot, remember to download the PDF for ""Decoding the Secrets of Egyptian Hieroglyphs"". It has a summary of every lesson, gives a tiny bit of homework (and the answers) and it also has a list of hieroglyphs, pronouns and a dictionary. The [History of Ancient Egypt](https://www.thegreatcoursesplus.com/history-of-ancient-egypt) is also great (but a bit old) and don't forget its PDF either. Good luck, I bet you will love learning Hieroglyphic and Egyptian history!

&gt; Are modern day Egyptians still learning Hieroglyphics in school? That would be a great way of keeping the culture alive.

Arabic and Ancient Egyptian would sound similar to Europeans/Americans because they are both *Afro-Asiatic languages* but they are very different and mutually unintelligible. Egypt actually considered using a modified form of egyptian hieroglyphs to write Arabic but it was abandoned in favor of Arabic. Today Coptic (using greek letters) clings on in a handful of Coptic families by being passed on orally but those who speak Coptic are just as fluent in it as Arabic so a [revival like modern Hebrew](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HBiiad9fO-g) would be possible but it's not on the table at the moment. You can learn Coptic yourself and for starters there's [many](https://m.youtube.com/user/sgyouthservant/videos?view=0&amp;sort=da&amp;flow=list) free videos about it [online](https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJG-bLjAjVOlHWI-Vxl681LP7N-TSnJQo) but Coptic's sole usage today is reading the Bible. As Bob Brier will show the Exodus in Coptic is a treasure trove of information about Ancient Egypt.

The English equivalent, Gentile, IMO is offensive in the other way as it comes from Genteel and was meant to make the distinction between the supposedly Genteel European Christian and the barbarous Jew.

Koliko je NDH afirmativna pojava u hrvatskoj istoriji, govori činjenica da je Hrvati izuzimaju iz kontinuiteta istorijske državnosti. Svest o tome je Srbima mnogo više od neprijatne epizode.

Sad, zašto Srbi nisu prihvatili plan koji bi im omogućio autonomnost u okviru Hrvatske možda ima neke veze s tim što ni Hrvati nisu tražili za sebe entitet u Bosni, odnosno sa aranžmanima koje su Sloba i Franjo pravili među sobom.

You said

&gt;We know from polling that more support indy than the SNP on its own.

I don't care about polling I've made that clear many many times now, polling can be wrong, there are margin of errors between it and the actual result of  voting in an election. The SNP having the most seats means nothing when they didn't get the required majority support for Indy like the Unionists did.

Once again INDY PARTIES GOT 46%, UNIONIST PARTIES GOT 56%. 

&gt;But it's relevant. 

&gt;Why would this be settled another way when it doesn't seem like it was for the UK's question on the EU.

&gt;Tories promised a referendum. 

&gt;Got elected on won and held it.

&gt;Despite most voting for pro-EU parties in the 2015 election.

That depends on my view on the Brexit referendum doesn't it? If I disagreed with the UK doing it after not having Parliamentary support then I'm not being hypocritical.

&gt;For some reason you think that the Scottish shouldn't get one because the SNP ""only"" got 45% of the vote.

No I just disagree with your statement that ""the majority of Scotland wants independence"" and your assertion that the independence movement has a mandate when Scotland in an actual election (which once again I obviously need to point out is more valid than polls) voted majority Unionist parties. Most Scottish voters voted for Unionist Parties not Indy parties.

Something big might have to happen in the 1940s/50s to stop it. 

The second thing is what takes its place. 
If we don't see a flowering (in places) of liberalism, what do we see? A swing to the right, or a continuation of the status quo? 

Lastly, what comes after? How do the kids react? What do we see 1980-2000?


WW2, it can be argued, turbocharged a liberal movement in the West after huge swathes of the general public witnessed totalitarianism in action. Racism, sexism and religious hatred were associated with the enemies of freedom, to various degrees.
Now that sentiment certainly didn't last long. Jim Crow didn't die in the war, but he was injured.
Seeds were planted.
Talking of seeds, the boomer generation are a significant factor here. They were relatively well off, numerous and not their parents.

Let's say the war lasts longer, or Russia gets nukes, or push on against th Allies past the Elbe. 
More death leads to fewer survivor to have children, less money &amp; resources, possibly a drive towards further conservatism as a survival measure in the next Generation to restrict the chance of further war. Appeasement, perhaps.
After WW1, a scarred Europe used appeasement to not go into war again. Not thru weakness.

So the grey 60s-80s drone on. Kids are now being born not burned by war. Living in greyness. They want colour and freedom. Anti nukes. Anti hate. 
A wave of passive resistance starts across the British Empire. Independence flowers in India and Africa in the 1990s. It spreads. Soviet France, aided by a Spain free of Francoism breaks free. Soviet tanks can't keep the Eurobloc together with US convert support in Germany, and on and on. Today, president Putin is assassinated by an angry KGB faction, which leads to a bloody civil war and more independence in Europe in the 2020s...

That's my take &amp; thoughts anyway. It's done on the hoof, so many be big issues I have missed, so appologies for that.

The terms so vague and meaningless even just in the U.K. The Boris Johnson government get called Right wing but they’re basically ‘New Labour’ with points based immigration policy (which outside of the EU is totally normal) and a couple other caveats. 

Not trying crap on your post but what people think of as Left and Right is constantly changing within countries (let alone between them) so that makes things harder to pin down. But I think, at least for the U.K., most people who are labour supporters, and lets say ‘New Labour’, are mainly a remain group and they make up the bulk of the ‘Left’. It’s only the hard core socialists and communists that didn’t like the EU (Corbyn). 

I’m saying this because I’m guessing for a lot of remainers they see CANZUK as a right wing idea (initially) because it’s the not the EU-which is seen as progressive and morally superior (rightly or wrongly). Firstly, because CANZ are not seen as ‘foreign’, secondly; ties to the Empire and thirdly because the EU has marketed itself so well as progressive force (rightly or wrongly). These three things makes it hard for New Labour people to attach themselves to CANZUK unless they’ve seen more than a meme. Whereas Conservatives don’t particularly care for the EU all that much. That lack of attachment makes it an easier thing to get on board with at first glance.

As you maybe know, Zimbabwe was called Rhodesia immediately after its independence. It was a de facto one party dictatorship under the Rhodesian front. The front was seeking independence from Great Britain, but was also of the opinion that the white minority was naturally superior to the „black race“ and therefore a country by whites for whites should be established. Things got pretty bad and the state lost a revolutionary war against Mugabe and his alles, who himself became a dictator after that. Rhodesia was boycotted by most countries for its racist ideology. 

For white supremacists and similar racist organisations, Rhodesia became kind of a martyr. The fact that Zimbabwe is a total mess is their favourite example to prove black inferiority. That’s the reason why you’ll find some mentions of BLM down here in the comments, even though an American social justice movement doesn’t have a lot to do with the failed land reform of a African dictatorship. They’ll bring up the story how the international’s community (controlled by the group of your choice) suppressed white excellence in favour of black barbarism. Sometimes it’s an early example of the white genocide coming to Europe and the USA they fear so much.

If you invite a group of people out to eat then almost always you will order for the whole party - albeit with some discussion.  Generally dishes are shared.  So you order enough bulk (bread or rice), sides (often salads) and then some meat and fish (usually grills) to be shared.  The food in restaurants is kind of designed that way and you wouldn't normally see in restaurants the sort of single serve style dishes (stews etc) that people eat at home.  For a big party, people will quite often call ahead to alert the kitchen that there's ten people coming in for the whole roast sheep (I kid you only partly).  The person who issues the invite pays - and to be honest, we're a big bragging, show off culture, so you let them.

The other kind of eating out in smaller parties (up to four say) is different too.  If I'm out with two friends the rule is we order bulk, a couple of sides and one more grill/main than the number in the party.  So if there's three of us, we order four grills (writing it like that it sounds like an enormous amount of food, but portions are modest, honest).  Now, when the food arrives you share.  So, tldr, took a British friend to a traditional place with a couple of old country friends and we ordered.  He chose a nice grill.  When the food arrived he picked it up and dumped the whole lot on his plate.  Fortunately he was oblivious to the distress this caused my friends and I didn't see any point in saying anything.

My friend who was from NY changed to an SC license when her NY DL ran out while she was a student in SC.

She decided not to get another NY one because in SC and elsewhere she had issues with bouncers thinking it was fake - apparently around that time NY DL were on a very thin plastic, which if you're used to the credit card Thickness which is usual then it can be an issue.

But when she was back in NY she had further issues. Apparently many bouncers spotted fakes by bending the corners together... Which would snap the DL of pretty much every other state.

So basically every time she went back to NY they'd snap her DL and then she couldn't drink for the remainder of the break.

My South Korean friend had it differently. They thought her passport was fake because in SK they put the DOB as the international standard of yyyy/mm/dd. They were fine with the European dd/mm instead of American mm/dd but putting the year first really threw them for a loop. They actually tried to confiscate it as a fake but she threatened to call the cops.

I had to leave the squad, de-tag, re-tag, and THEN I could post.  After that I saw several others so don’t know if it was to do with me that my LFG came down and I couldn’t post a new or see any, or something was happening to the LFG system.

Thousands of bicycles are stolen in the city every year. Bicycle brand VanMoof came up with something against the theft of their expensive city bikes: they send bike hunters on the hunt. ""You have to be strong for this job.""

Tahrim RamdjanJuly 30, 2020 , 11:52 am
It's summer vacation, but chemistry student Idse Luirink (22) is working hard in the office of bicycle brand VanMoof on the Mauritskade in East. He and his colleague Indigo Versteeg (25) are looking at the map of Amsterdam on his laptop. Dozens of red dots attract attention: all stolen VanMooff bicycles. When Luirink zooms out, the map of the Netherlands appears - with a few stray red dots in Utrecht and Gelderland - and then that of all of Europe. “Romania is apparently a hot spot,” says Luirink, pointing to the ten red dots there.


Luirink and Versteeg work as bike hunters . Bicycle brand VanMoof employs 25 all over the world, in every branch: from Berlin to Tokyo. Five bicycle hunters are permanently working in Amsterdam. Two to three days a week, they try to recover stolen bicycles from the brand. The bicycles, which cost an average of two thousand euros each, have a built-in chip in the frame, which emits a location every half hour as soon as the bicycle is reported as stolen. Sometimes that location is not entirely accurate and the bike hunters have to investigate on the spot.

Fear of theft
VanMoof founder Taco Carlier (42) noticed that many of his friends in the city did not dare to ride an electric bicycle. ""Everyone was afraid it would be stolen,"" he says. “Theft is the main reason why people worldwide don't buy a high-quality bicycle.” From his technical background - Carlier studied at TU Delft - the idea arose to build in a tracker. “Many people didn't believe it at first. But I can still remember the adrenalin from the first bike hunt , on the Leidsegracht. That was so addictive. Then everyone wanted to join the office. ”

 
The red dots on the map of Amsterdam are all stolen VanMooffiets. IMAGE MARC DRIESSEN
How do you become a bicycle hunter? “I live in Oud-West and I study at Science Park in the Watergraafsmeer,” says Luirink. “I was hesitant between a scooter and a bicycle, but soon ended up with a VanMoo bike. In the shop I saw a vacancy for a bike hunter . ” Versteeg worked in the festival industry, but thought he spent too much time in the office. ""I really liked VanMoof's bikes, and the track suited what I wanted: less in the office.""

Golden area
When Luirink cycles to and from lectures, he sometimes looks up a stolen bicycle along the way. ""Then I will stop by and I will be finished half an hour later."" Versteeg even went abroad to track down bicycles. ""We drove to Essen in Germany, but at some point the chip was no longer transmitting,"" he says. A blue container stood at the indicated location in Essen. When they opened it, there was no bicycle in sight. However, the stolen bicycle suddenly sent a signal in Antwerp. ""It was a quick consultation with the head office: what are we going to do?"" Versteeg was allowed to drive to Belgium at the expense of the business and book a hotel stay. He spent the night searching with the local police for a bicycle in the port of Antwerp. ""That was quite exciting, but for this work you have to be strong and not just accept no.""

Unfortunately, he nevertheless returned to Amsterdam empty-handed. Nevertheless, Versteeg's adventure was not in vain: the bike hunters film everything they do, including for VanMoof's social media channels. “When we're not on the hunt, we also research the bikes that are the most interesting to find.”

Carlier says there are two types of hunts. In the first type, bicycle hunters look for stolen bicycles in the city. In principle, VanMoof offers a 'recovery guarantee' for every bicycle within two weeks after theft. Five to twenty VanMoof bicycles are stolen worldwide every month. Seventy percent of those are recovered within those two weeks. If those two weeks are not met, the owner will receive a new copy.

In the second kind, hunters look up the most interesting stories. ""That is not profitable,"" says Carlier. “In fact, they often don't even take those bikes back. But that is how they put the theme of bicycle theft on the map. ” And somewhere it is also an investment, he hopes. “Ultimately, bicycle thieves see that and will be careful to steal a VanMoof.”

Two years ago, a bike hunter went to Casablanca in Morocco, against the advice of the local police. The bicycle initially remained without a trace, but still sent a signal a year later. This led to the discovery of an entire department store full of stolen bicycles.

Sometimes a cold case is reopened, such as today. The bicycle that Versteeg and Luirink are looking for was reported as stolen in January and did not send a signal for six months - until this week. The hunters set off in the center of Amsterdam. ""That is always a golden area, where we find many bicycles,"" says Luirink. “We often find a bicycle only two hundred meters away from where it was parked. Then someone tried to steal it, but failed. ”

Found full of stickers
He must be standing somewhere at the Spiegelgracht. Modest clouds have given way to a relentless downpour. ""That is also part of the job, sometimes cycling for hours through the rain and not finding anything,"" says Versteeg. The men are well prepared: they have a tracker that goes off when the bicycle is within fifteen meters. They also take a grinder with them, because stolen bicycles go back to the head office in East.

Bike hunters have developed a sixth sense for stolen bicycles, says Versteeg: ""If there is another lock around the bicycle or it has been handled incorrectly, such a bicycle will stand out."" Today that sixth sense also has an effect: they find the VanMoof in the Fokke Simonszstraat, covered with stickers. ""That makes such a bicycle suspicious,"" says Luirink. ""Especially since the taillight of stolen VanMoofs always flashes, and precisely that taillight was taped.""

They are sure that it is the right bike when the tracker goes off. Who thinks of a penetrating siren is wrong: the sound that is heard is the same sound that you hear when you find a Pokémon on a Nintendo game computer.

 
IMAGE MARC DRIESSEN
Versteeg grinds the bike loose. This often leads to surprised looks among passers-by. “But we always wear our VanMoof clothing and are happy to explain it,” says Luirink. ""Most people find it funny."" Sometimes the bike hunters also call the police in advance, so that they are informed. This time, it remains with two women who are looking desperately at the scene, but still run away, and a mail delivery boy who can laugh about it.

The search for the bicycle that had been stolen six months ago took only fifteen minutes. With one hand on their own handlebars and the stickered bicycle on the other, the men return to the office, happy with their catch. ""Nice, old man,"" one says to the other.

Vou ilustrar, vc é tipo um X-Men e precisa de um professor Xavier pra te ajudar a controlar seus poderes e usá-los para o bem. 

Vc tem q ver com naturalidade a influência dos espíritos em nossa vida, não como algo sobrenatural ou maléfico. Muitos médiuns têm medos e o medo existe quando desconhecemos a natureza daquilo q nos causa medo. Não tenha medo. A relação dos espíritos conosco jamais será como nos filmes de terror onde os espíritos assombram e matam os encarnados.

**There is so much rift about corona vaccines that far from everyone can be helped right away.**  

There is reason for optimism because a new Danish experiment with corona vaccine at the Statens Serum Institut has shown promising results in tests on mice.

\- It is certainly positive. Denmark has a lot to offer in the development of a vaccine and has a long history of vaccine production, says Flemming Konradsen, professor of global health at the University of Copenhagen.

This is the second Danish attempt which, within a few months, offers a serious bid for a knockout in the fight to stop the worldwide corona pandemic.

\- The more horses we have to play on, the better. We know that far from all vaccine candidates finish. You have to develop and test a wide range before you have a sufficiently effective vaccine without side effects, Flemming Konradsen explains. 

## Human experiments in 2021

The good results mean that the Statens Serum Institut now plans to move on to the next phase, which is to test the vaccine candidate on monkeys.

The Statens Serum Institut has an ambition to be able to begin so-called phase 1 trials on humans in the autumn or early 2021, says chief virologist, professor and chief physician dr . with. Anders Fomsgaard, who is leading the experiment. 

He shares the assessment that more effective vaccines only benefit the global fight against Covid-19.

\- When many people need a vaccine , it is important that there are different to take off. In terms of production and supply, you must have as many eggs in the basket as possible. It could also be that they work differently, so some work best on older people, while others work on younger people, he says. 

Over 12 million people have been tested positive for coronavirus worldwide and the demand for an effective vaccine will be so great that there is not enough for everyone to begin with, predicts Flemming Konradsen.

\- We do not want billions of doses ready right away, and there may soon be a political demand that Mr and Mrs Jensen should also benefit from the vaccine . We will end up with some becoming winners in the distribution of a vaccine , he says. 

## The United States and Europe can secure everything

He predicts a global discussion on whether to distribute the first vaccines globally or regionally.

Whether a vaccine should be given according to age groups or risk groups. And about how solidary they should be offered. 

Whether, for example, the most vulnerable in hospitals and nursing homes in Europe should have the vaccine before healthcare professionals in Africa or Latin America .

A country can also try to buy everything on the market, as happened in the United States, which has secured the corona drug Remdesivir for three months ahead of Europe and the rest of the world.

\- The same discussion could arise in Europe, where it really requires political courage and a man's heart to say that health professionals in, for example, Malawi must be taken into account before someone in the risk group in Europe, says Flemming Konradsen. 

For the sake of global health, we should already now think about training staff and securing infrastructure so that you do not end up in a scenario where the vaccine, for example, never reaches a poor part of the world, because, among other things, something as basic as cooling systems is missing. to store the vaccine in.

\- There are already children who die because they do not have access to vaccines we have already developed. In the tail of vaccine development, there must be a system so that low-income countries with both poor infrastructure and health care also have easy access to the vaccine , points out Flemming Konradsen.

Experts estimate that it will take at least a year or more before a vaccine is ready to enter the market.",True,False,False,,,,0,1596287280,,False,0,{},fzzb4s6,True,t3_i1rwb3,False,True,t3_i1rwb3,/r/Coronavirus/comments/i1rwb3/expert_on_danish_corona_trials_good_with_another/fzzb4s6/,False,,1604475391,2,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],

It wasn't pleasant at all, but Germany had the Benelux, the baltics, the slovaks, slovens, austrians and fins on their side, and managed to get roughly what they wanted most of the time. But as the largest members of that government coalition in the Eurogroup they got targeted for a lot of hate as a result. At the same time, the PIGS, as they were called, got a lot of nasty comments as well. It was a very divisive period since Eurogroup negotiations are purely national, no parliament or EU rules involved, so nationalism gets involved a lot.

I imagine from your comment on holding the same position as Germany, I take it your country was part of the F4. The insults leveled on Germany simply transfered to the other largest member. And, even worse, while Germany lead a majority coalition, the F4 are a tiny fraction, making even more enemies as a result.

But the veto was the thing that turn things really acrimonious, because the veto doesn't make everyone equal with each other. Instead it makes any one member equal to the other 26 in total. This gets a lot of impressions of being totalitarian and dictatorial, and it was not a smart move to use it as leverage in the long term. Cameron did the same in 2011, and he got exiled politically as a result.

I guess what I am trying to say is: I am utterly confused on your positions of ""being too small to matter""  because you got some hate. If anything, the hate was directed because you mattered in a very important issue, and mattered so much you stood against not only a majority of members, but a majority of the EU population.

You're trying to put the absolute rate into words but we have clear statistics on it: [“The number needed to [circumcise] to prevent one HIV infection varied, from 1,231 in white males to 65 in black males, with an average in all males of 298.”](http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision) That originates from the CDC.

A terrible statistic. Especially when circumcision is not effective prevention and condoms must be used regardless.

And to be clear, that's the exact same data set presented in two different ways; relative rate and absolute rate. For details on how those numbers work [you can check out Dr. Guest's critique on the HIV studies.](https://youtu.be/XwZiQyFaAs0?t=1h01m10s)

And we can look at the real world results: [“The African findings are also not in line with the fact that the United States combines a high prevalence of STDs and HIV infections with a high percentage of routine circumcisions. The situation in most European countries is precisely the reverse: low circumcision rates combined with low HIV and STD rates. Therefore, other factors seem to play a more important role in the spread of HIV than circumcision status. This finding also suggests that there are alternative, less intrusive, and more effective ways of preventing HIV than circumcision, such as consistent use of condoms, safe-sex programs, easy access to antiretroviral drugs, and clean needle programs.""](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2013/03/12/peds.2012-2896)

But there's another very big aspect. HIV via sex is not relevant to newborns or children. The authors above continue: [""As with traditional STDs, sexual transmission of HIV occurs only in sexually active individuals. Consequently, from an HIV prevention perspective, if at all effective in a Western context, circumcision can wait until boys are old enough to engage in sexual relationships. Boys can decide for themselves, therefore, whether they want to get circumcised to obtain, at best, partial protection against HIV or rather remain genitally intact and adopt safe-sex practices that are far more effective.  As with the other possible benefits, circumcision for HIV protection in Western countries fails to meet the criteria for preventive medicine: there is no strong evidence for effectiveness and other, more effective, and less intrusive means are available.

In Europe languages within the major families (Germanic, Slavic, Romance) kind of continuously morph into each other (it was even more so in the past before people had TV and Internet).

I think the example that was commonly used was that if you start somewhere in Italy and go to Paris the language in any village may not differ that drastically from the previous one (they are still mutually intelligible) but Parisian French is definitely not Italian. But where do you draw the line when each village can understand its neighbors? They are speaking ""dialects"" but are they Italian or French dialects?

I am sure some of these phenomena exist in Chinese as well. I am only somewhat familiar with Mandarin and Cantonese and they do look like different languages to me, but certainly there are some in between forms. People in the south speak Mandarin differently than people in the north. Also Cantonese speakers tend to pronounce some sounds differently even when speaking Mandarin, perhaps not making a clear distinction between sounds that are not different in Cantonese.

To make things more complicated there is even a way how to read ""formal Chinese"" by a Cantonese speaker, which is kind of like Mandarin with a Cantonese pronunciation, so which language is it?

[],,[deleted],,,,,,,dark,,,,,[],"It’s not often that feminists threaten legal action over plans to increase women’s representation on public boards, so the Scottish Government has managed something of a feat. 'For Women Scotland', a volunteer-funded gender-critical lobby group, isn’t against the principle of the Gender Representation on Public Boards Act. It’s the Scottish Government’s definition of ‘women’ they have a problem with.

The statutory guidance for the Act defines ‘woman’ to include a transwoman without a gender recognition certificate who nonetheless must meet three criteria:

1) enjoys the protected characteristic of gender reassignment under the Equality Act 2010

2) is proposing to undergo or has already undergone a process to change their sex from male to female

3) is living as a woman.

The law 'would not require the person to dress, look or behave in any particular way’, but ‘it would be expected that there would be evidence that the person was continuously living as a woman’, for example, by employing female pronouns or using their female name on their driving licence, passport and utility bills.

On its face, and to anyone not familiar with the labyrinthian intricacies of gender law, this might sound like a reasonable compromise to accommodate a minority population. But For Women point to a clarification in the guidance: ‘The Act does not require an appointing person to ask a candidate to prove that they meet the definition of woman in the Act.’ This represents a ‘wholesale redefinition of women’, according to For Women, and they suspect the law on gender recognition is being changed by stealth.

The group’s spokeswoman Marion Calder says:

‘It beggars belief that the Scottish Government has introduced new legislation that contravenes the very essence of what a “woman” is in law. This is just the introduction of self-identification of sex by the back door… We believe this Act raises significant concerns for the status of women in Scotland. As a tool for increasing the representation of women, it is rendered ineffective and may be used as precedent to undermine legal protections for women in a manner which runs counter to UK and EU equality law.’

The campaigners’ lawyers have sent a letter to the Scottish Government, citing a legal opinion from Aidan O’Neill, one of the QCs behind the Supreme Court challenge to Boris Johnson’s prorogation of Parliament. The group contends that the Scottish Government is redefining ‘women’ in a manner that exceeds its authority under the Scotland Acts, which reserve equalities law to Westminster.

They also argue that ministers ‘failed to assess the impact of applying the new law on the need to advance equality between women and men, or consider the need to foster good relations’. They warn that should Nicola Sturgeon’s government press ahead, they will consider seeking a judicial review. A Scottish Government spokesperson said: 'We will give the letter full consideration when we receive it.'

This is a headache the SNP doesn’t need but, it must be said, one they keep bringing on themselves. Their determination to remove medical experts from the gender recognition process — allowing people to ‘self-identify’ as male or female — has caused bitter division in the ranks of a party typified by Stepfordish unanimity.

Last June, Scottish ministers announced a pause and a fresh consultation to assuage critics before shelving the changes when Covid-19 hit. But there is a fervent commitment to gender ideology both within the Scottish Government and the upper echelons of the SNP, so it’s not surprising that For Women are on alert for legislative jiggery-pokery. For gender critical women within the SNP, the Sturgeon administration’s approach to these matters puts them in an impossible position, forcing them to choose between what they believe and who they are.

What is exasperating is that, in allowing themselves to be talked into a brazen overreach, politicians at Holyrood and Westminster raised the hopes of transgender campaigners while provoking a backlash from those with profound political and philosophical objections not only to particular policies but the ideas that underpin them. They made promises so far-reaching and with such disregard for public consent that they created the circumstances in which their assurances could not be delivered. For all their progressive rhetoric, these self-styled champions of equality have succeeded only in subjecting trans people to an acrimonious debate about deeply personal matters and are causing women to be cast as bigots for asserting their rights under a law barely a decade old.

Although this particular building is a bit younger (late 17th-century), the Place des Vosges is often described as the oldest public square in France, and was created in 1605 as a way to renew the urban landscape of Paris, which suffered a lot from the civil war of Religion. Because of its peculiar shape creating and oasis of calm in a dense city, and the prestige of its origins, it evolved to become one of the most expensive neighborhoods in Europe, often considered the ultimate status symbol in France.

If you are interested in the history of Paris, a few friends and I, PhD historians in academia, produced [a documentary on the place des Vosges](https://youtu.be/8hFI9ScQVac) (in French) covering how it evolved from modest dwellings for silk workers to the epitome of aristocracy.

&gt; On Friday, the leading infectious disease expert in the US, Dr Anthony Fauci, said he hoped that Russia - and China - were &amp;quot;Actually testing the vaccine&amp;quot; before administering them to anyone.

&gt; Scores of possible coronavirus vaccines are being developed around the world and more than 20 are currently in clinical trials.

Obama did some shady shit, but he was a decent leader and tried to help the US's image problem.

Angela merkel after meeting with trump held a press conference the next day, even tho she wasnt supposed to hold one and said ""The times where we can rely on others is to the most extend over. Germany and the EU have to work together and cant rely on others any more""

I disagree that religion is adapted to locals, as much as I think locals are adapted to a religion, via destruction and rebuilding of their holy sites, suppression of their language, subordination of their mythical figures as minor prophets/saints/figures within aspects of Christianity. They didn't so much blend in pagan beliefs or representations of their gods as co-opt and strip them of their identities like the Borg assimilate cultures.

You won't find any Mormons painting pictures of black prophets when they go on their missionary trips to Africa, for example, nor does the Catholic Church generally allow that depiction within its churches, even in Africa. Depicting Jesus as black or Korean or any other ethnicity is relatively rare. Eurocentric and/or white centric supremacy in religion has been used to justify colonialism and human degradation for centuries. But it also strongly informs modern day American politics, which have repercussions all over the world. This is an interesting article/podcast on the topic.

If you are referring to Jamal Pasha then that's completely different, he is not an ottoman and a Turkish nationalist and it was in the last few years of the empire. Judging a Muslim civilization entire history by nationalists who hijacked and took control of it at the last few years of it's life is narrow minded and idiotic. Also what Jamal Pasha did might be wrong but it definitely is not genocide. 

""Backward thinking"". I don't understand this. What are you referring to? They didn't go around promoting backward thinking. The ottoman empire was one of the most tolerant states in history, especially compared to its European rivals. 

Man all you just said was being a French colony is ""better"" than being an integral state part of a Muslim civilization? You don't even give any evidence on their supposed ""cruel"" rule, you just throw it into your passage. What did the french do other than suppress and kill syrians? Maybe they build a road or a railroad here and there but not because they cared for Syrians, it was to run their colonies more effectively and to move troops faster to quell rebellions. Also you said ""culturally""? What? Do you not understand how much culture was spread around in the ottoman empire, so many different cultures co existing together created a multicultural civilization that saw these cultures interact and share things with one another. Food is one easy example that comes to mind, along with language similarities. Please be informed on french colonialism before you say something so out of reality in history. Look at how France massacred and genocided so many in Algeria and funneled in French settlers to replace the Algerian population. France literally labelled Syria along with other Arab countries as mandates with Britain because they thought we were ""too savage and uncivilized"", to rule ourselves. And you want to tell me we gained from them? 

This arguemnt that colonizers gave technology and helped colonies prosper is false and used mainly by racists and the far right to justify colonial empires. In reality, technology travels around pretty much the moment it gets invented, and all sources show that natives of a colony started innovating and using technology to modernize and get their country going (specifically after the colonizer leaves) to find it's place in the world. This is what happened in Syria like many other former colonies.

There will also be differences in shipping, import taxes, distribution and storage costs etc which could move the associated costs of getting the things where they need to be up and down depending on the details.

[],,[deleted],,,,,,,dark,,,,,[],"Bloomberg had an Op-ed about how millennials are becoming ""socialists"" because of everything that has occurred in the past twenty years.

The specific part that I found most interesting was that when the '08 recession occurred, millennials were, more than previous generations, unemployed and especially paid less than prior generations, and the interesting part that they brought up was that they had to resort to service jobs. Not only is it bad for their future income because what you're paid at the beginning of your career typically is the trajectory of your future income, but fast forward 12 years, and we have a pandemic that is not only ruining employment opportunities for younger generations--now, including Gen Z--but *the pandemic is especially hitting service jobs.* So what we at least had in the '08 recession is not there now if things take a turn for the worse during the pandemic.

It also pointed out the hypocrisy--as this post has pointed out--of what people have apparently called ""Boomer Socialism,"" a term I actually had never heard before. The fact that older generation have social programs afforded to them, but they're all too frequently telling younger generations to deal with their problems alone. [If you care to read it, here it is.](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-07-25/ok-boomer-coronavirus-is-turning-millennials-into-socialists)

My favorite part though is:

&gt;Whether Millennials actually use the word “socialism” properly — as government ownership of the means of production — is moot. More likely, they simply want better public policy that addresses their specific problems. Even then, however, they often fall prey to political snake oil such as rent controls or wealth taxes.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The better path for policymakers across the West is to offer more pragmatic, but still sufficiently bold, alternatives**. And as I’ve argued, this means reviving classical liberalism — not in the American sense of “left” but in the European sense of “freedom.”

This is something I've continuously repeated over and over again over the past however many years is pragmatism in our politics. We've gotta stop jerking off these ideologies like ""free market libertarianism, socialism, blah blah blah"" and start actually taking steps that are realistic, have been shown to work in other countries (I loved the fact that the article specifically brought up Germany), and actually improve the lives of citizens. Whatever happened to this country being problem solvers? You don't have to align every policy with whether it promotes socialism or capitalism, or whatever.

European Zionists are indigenous to EUROPE, Ethiopians indigenous to Ethiopia, Yemenis indigenous to Yemen. You cannot claim to be indigenous of a far off land just because your religion mythology has settings in that land thousands of years ago!! (Everybody KNOWS most Zionists were not religious, which is even more delusional). Balinese people in Indonesia practice Hinduism, they are indigenous to Bali and cannot colonize India and claim to be indigenous from there, it’s delusional. A non religious Balines wanting to colonize India is equally delusional. 

Zionists colonizers migrated to Palestine, who was the colonial ruler is IRRELEVANT, zionist colonizers migrated and settled in Palestine. You ignoring the indigenous people in favor of the ruling power IS RACIST!!! 

You obviously have a very obtuse understanding of history You see in the Levant, Canaan, now the land of Palestine, there have been DOZENS of peoples, civilizations and empires, BEFORE AND AFTER your mythology and for longer time. NOT just one. There were many BEFORE Hebrew invasion and many after. Stop being racist supremacist, you are not special, that is NOT HOW HISTORY WORKS, its not that your mythology is the only thing existing thing on the planet. There were many BEFORE the Hebrews (who are UNRELATED to today’s Zionists) and many after, you are NOT special, that is very racist. The indigenous Palestinian people are the result of thousands of years of empires and civilizations living on that land.  Actually, there are beautiful traces of Aramaic (the language that jews used to speak 2000 years ago) in the Palestinian dialect, obvious historical continuity of a people. Hebrew on the other hand, was a dead language for over 2300 years and was reconstructed by German speaking zionists a little over 100 years ago.

Because of your racist colonial epistemology you think that Palestinians are just “Arabs” but you don’t understand how human communities evolve throughout history, the Palestinian People are the result of thousands of years and dozens of rulers over their land, their culture, music, gastronomy, embroidery, dance, LANGUAGE (Levantine dialect) ATTEST for cultural continuity. They are the indigenous people of that area of the Levant, Palestine. I know racists disregard indigenous peoples, so no surprise here that recently arrived Europeans have the delusions of calling themselves indigenous of the land they colonize. 

So yes, colonial settlers arriving to Palestine are settler colonizers. Regardless of any delusional excuse of “having been there thousands of years ago”.

People who had been living there before the colonists arrived are indigenous to that land despite their rulers.
Yes, again you ignore history but what is well documented is that the colonists began the ethnic cleansing. The colonized Palestinian people OBVIOUSLY would resist.

As you keep regurgitating the same Orientalist colonial propaganda WITHOUT EVER quoting any history you clearly need to educate yourself, if you ever what to deconstruct your colonial racism you need to start reading.
Read Israeli philologist Nurit Peled-Elhanan to understand your colonial epistemology; she is Professor at the Hebrew University, daughter of Mati Peled, one of the founders of the State of Israel, and lost her daughter in an attack in Jerusalem, read her, specially “Palestine in Israeli Books: Ideology and Propaganda in Education” (2012) to start off. Read history books, for example excellent Israeli Jewish Historian Ilan Pappe, all his extensive work based on historic evidence, specially ""The ethnic cleansing of Palestine"" (2006) and “Ten Myths about Israel” (2017), read Walid Khalidi “All that Remains: The Palestinian Villages Occupied and Depopulated by Israel in 1948“ (1992), read Jewish historian and Profesor Emeritus at Tel Aviv University Shlomo Sand, mainly ""The Invention of the land of Israel"" (2012) ""The invention of the Jewish People"" (2008) this will help you understand what indigenous people are in the Middle East (Spoiler, yes the Palestinians are!, yes, confirmed by jewish historians!), read Israeli activist Miko Peled (Also Mati Peled’s son) “The General's Son: Journey of an Israeli in Palestine” (2012), Nur Mashalha “Palestine a 4000 year history” (2018), read Edward Said (extensive, very detailed bibliography), start by learning what Orientalism is; read Jewish Linguist Chomsky and his numerous articles and work on the issue of Palestine. Read Iraqi jewish author Naeim Giladi, who was one of the first Mizrahi Zionists, staunch Zionist who migrated to Israel, promoted the colonization and served in wars, he eventually realizes the truth and writes “Ben-Gurion's Scandal: How the Haganah and the Mossad Eliminated Jews” (2003) explaining how the Zionists destroyed Jewery in the Middle East, on this account read about the Lavon Affair as well and about USS Liberty, why not… Read the direct history sources like the IDF Archives, the Hagana Archives; they themselves describe the details of the ethnic cleansing, how they bombed entire villages just to expel the entire Palestinian population forever and take over their land. Read all about Plan Dalet, and how the Zionists meticulously planned the ethnic cleansing, the extermination and destruction of hundreds of Palestinian towns to incept a new state exclusively for immigrants. Read Yale and Oxford Historian Rashid Khalidi, for example “The Hundred Years' War on  Palestine: A History of Settler Colonialism and Resistance, 1917–2017” (2020) to understand the beginning and development of the issue. Read the hundreds of accounts and interviews attesting the ethnic cleansing in places like Palestine Remembered. Read Ben Gurion’s Diaries, VERY IMPORTANT direct history source, read how he explicitly is calling for ethnic cleansing, depopulation, expulsion, and massacres, literally calling for it for decades, BEFORE 1948.

I legitimately don’t understand what you’re asking here. What do you mean when you say these improvements need to be “funded”. Eg. how is it that putting in place a law against child labor needs to be “funded”?

—

Just so we’re on the same page, exploitation in this context is when a worker produces some good for a company and gets paid less than the value of the goods produced, because they do not own the means of production (the company does).

Fundamentally, the capitalist economy is built on this. If you own the means of production, the more you can underpay people (ie. the more extremely you can exploit them) the more profit you stand to gain. The incentive of a company under a capitalist economy is to pay their employees as little as possible and charge as much as possible for their product. That includes things like medicine that people need to take in order not to straight up die :)

Look at the pharma industry in the US, which runs under a more pure capitalist model. Now look at it in Canada, where the government plays a bigger role. Notice the difference in drug prices for the consumers, and the fact that things in the US (spoiler) are fundamentally fucked up on that end. Try and tell me the US isn’t more exploitative here, especially of its consumers. Try me.

Have you experienced the US economy firsthand, especially as a low wage worker? It’s exploitative to the tits. Where I live, people have to sleep in their cars because jobs pay crumbs and housing costs a shit ton of money. Now compare this to a more socialist leaning European country.

That said, I'd still claim that governments, which supposedly forced economies to shut down, did them a favour. Quarantine saved the economies rather than stifled them.

In my country, we sat 2 months out, and now we're consuming even more than before the quarantine. If the quarantine had prolonged, many more businesses would've collapsed, or it would've taken much bigger deficits to cover for the sudden decline of credit flows. As I said, uncertainty is still a driving force. Despite our government being generous to the businesses and those that lost their jobs, credit flows from the banks and other lenders declined by 30%. If the pandemic was still going on, and on the basis of ""hammering out"" every virus hot spot, then the banks would still be more hesitant to lend to businesses in fears that they might become a coronavirus hot spot. 

All these reasons is why the quarantines in Europe saved the economies. Because it was in the interest of the country to shut everything down, but it was in the interest of each individual actor to maintain their levels of production. The quarantine solved this by making everyone sit this one out - because not a single producer would've if they saw  their competitors working.

This last point about individual vs. collective incentives is also why Americans are having so much trouble with it. Many Americans seem to have a very skewed ideal of liberty that dictates that any individual should not be blocked from pursuing his own personal interest under any circumstances, unless it has something to do with patriotism or national security.

[],,ConvenienceStoreDiet,1419125648.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_k8abg,False,False,[],"**Here are some dad-style tips:**

**Dating:** Go for it! Be a gentleman/lady or whatever relevant term works for you. And that doesn't necessarily mean conforming to gender standards. It means be kind, courteous, respectful. The best relationships of your life will feel like you're with your best friend. So treat them well. If you get rejected or don't get what you want, don't be a dick. Don't be vengeful. You'll probably be angry or hurt. It's not always about you or something you did. It's okay if things don't work out. Don't hurt others because of it. Put your time back into school work and hobbies. Respect boundaries. You WILL fuck up in a relationship somehow.

You might be scared to ask someone you like out on a date. Give it a try. If they say no, it'll be one of thousands on your journey. So no big deal. If they say yes, it'll be pretty cool. It's okay if they say yes or no. It's scary to open up. But it's important to respect their decision. Don't be a dick if they say ""no."" You'll want to try and protect yourself from feeling the pain of heartache by maybe lashing out or saying something mean. It's okay to feel that anger or hurt or pain. It's not okay to be a jerk about it. So be cool and move on.

The hard part about relationships is that we're all so unique that you learn through experience. You may discover you don't want one or are asexual or even your preferences or life goals. You discover yourself and how to treat others through the mistakes you make in them.

But go in knowing this. The other person isn't there to fix your problems. They're only there to experience the ride with you. No one owes you sex or their time or attention or anything for that matter. Discuss your boundaries and learn theirs, the other person may not have a clue. One person may think kissing is something you do naturally and spontaneously, the other may feel violated if you don't talk about it beforehand. Everyone is different based on their personalities, experiences, etc. So learn to talk and express your thoughts to someone intimately.

And don't heavily alter your life this early for someone you love. If she doesn't want you to be a doctor because she doesn't want to date a doctor, then she can go find someone who fits her mold. You do your best you. If she wants a baby and you want to study in Europe, go to Europe. You focus on getting your shit together and following your dreams. Your first relationship likely won't last a lifetime. Committing to fix a problem won't fix a problem. Right now, you do you first and get your life in order. Follow your path and know a relationship is best when you both naturally want the same things and work out well together, not force the thing to work. Compromise on the small stuff, but generally don't sacrifice your life goals on the biggest stuff.

And wear a condom ALWAYS when having sex.

**Drugs:** Don't smoke/vape. Don't do drugs. IF you do decide to experiment as an adult, I quote South Park: there's a time and place for everything and it's called ""college."" If you do, treat using as a special occasion or celebration to enhance a moment, not as a way to cope with your emotions. Do it responsibly around friends you trust with safe ways to get home. Limit your use to weekends when you don't have responsibilities. Take care of your shit first and be diligent about it. Don't pressure others to do it to make friends. Let them decide for themselves. Drugs will never make you happy, interesting, likeable, or take away the pain. Explore other options to deal with those. Hobbies. Meditation. Travel. Socializing. Therapy. Pets. And if you do decide to use, every one has its own individual risk factor. Stay the fuck away from anything that's physiologically addictive. Meth, coke, crack, opiates, heroin, nicotine. Your body can recover from a lot of shit, and you'll feel invincible when you're young, but some things are so fucked up you won't see how fucked up they are until it's too late. Trust us on this one and not your friends who tell you, ""yeah, it's just once. I love doing it."" You're too close to the fire at that point to see how big the flames are behind it. Don't let yourself be a statistic with, ""just once."" You don't walk up to a pack of hungry wolves or an angry bear ""just once."" Some things you can learn from experience. I think most people will say, ""you don't need to learn how bad heroin is going to fuck up your life from experience."" You'll have a lot of friends who want you to do drugs with them. It's okay to say no. If you feel pressured but don't want to, just let them know that you don't want to but you still want to be friends or hang out or whatever. It's just not your thing. When you're younger, everyone keeps asking, ""why why why."" Because they're trying to find a commonality you can bond with and haven't seen all the consequences of drugs. But you don't have to do everything everyone else is doing. You can still get along with others and not do exactly what they're doing to fit in. You be you. As you get older, people stop asking about drugs. Because we've all seen our shit, people losing loved ones to addiction, dropping out of school, etc.  and we get the consequences for some. Don't self-medicate with drugs. Smoking cigarettes doesn't ease any pain. If you want to use pot to deal with depression/anxiety/eating, talk with your doctor first. Don't be your own doctor. You have to know your risks first, and your friend's anecdotes won't be enough information. Everyone has a different view about drug use. This'll be your adult choice to make. But make that choice as an adult. Meaning be an adult first. Focus on your school first and taking care of your responsibilities first.

**Drinking:** same advice as above. For me, most of my friends started drinking around senior year. Most people drink. Decide if it's something you want to do if and when it comes up, but focus on your school first and foremost. Most cultures it's a common way of bonding. Alcohol reduces inhibitions, so if you're angry you won't hold back. If you're happy, you might feel happier. It doesn't fix problems or make you interesting. It won't help you cope with problems. It won't get rid of the pain. It only compounds problems. Avoid it on the weekdays. If you do, do it in moderation and make sure you have a safe way to get home. Make a game plan if you decide to drink. Call your parents or Uber if you're drunk and have to get home. Deal with your car the next day. Your parents would rather have you home alive than to have to bury you. You'll lose friends to drunk driving. As in, they will die. We all have. If your buddy's drunk and gets in a car, take his keys, pay for his Uber, do what you have to do. Let them hate you for it. Better they're alive the next day, or the family that dies to a drunk driver is. Be rigid about that. Know your limits, and you don't have to get fucked up when you drink. You can always do just a little if you like. I was never a drinker, but to get people off my back I might fill a beer bottle with water or hold a glass with Sprite and put a toothpick in it so peole thought I was classy.

Treat others well. You're gonna feel angry about a lot of shit. Try not to take it out on the people who are looking out for you.

!) Europe has many key differences than the US. Europe is largely homogeneous relative to the US, western Europe has half the population of the US total, and Europe is not governed the same as the US nor are their citizens guaranteed certain rights like we are in the US via the constitution. Given the massive differences in the US and western Europe, how can you say that their policies would work here and what policies, if any, would you like to see implemented that you believe would be successful.

2) What policies or economic ideologies do you see now that are similar to those leading up to the great depression?

3) What policies would you consider socialist were enacted during and after the great depression that led to the economic boom after WW2? And do you think it was those policies or the fact that US was about the only industrialized country to come out of that war relatively unscathed?

4) What you're talking about sounds more like mob rule than anything. Today I see a large portion of the population being brainwashed and having ideologues shoved down their throats. On both sides. How do you prevent this further and how do you prevent it from dictating the will of the people when it is obvious it is leading the people down a path that is completely disadvantageous for them and the group? Like relinquishing more power to a government or governing body?

5) Is there a necessary evil in any ideology that allows people to be more free or have more Independence and liberty? I see more freedom of choice under capitalism and I see, under capitalism, the greatest incentive for people to utilize this system... which is capital. Let's assume this is true... Human nature makes us inherently selfish to some degree, so how do you incentive production, innovation, research, creation, etc under a socialist ideology where that individual doesn't gain as much from his work or labor or time because it has gone to the group? I am inclined to believe that with limited government intervention or even perhaps some government incentivization, the production, innovation, exploration, and creativeness under capitalism far exceeds that which is capable under socialism because the individuals involved gain capitol from their work and their creations and their innovations AND they benefit the group instead of ONLY being about the group.",True,False,False,,,,0,1596307821,,False,0,{},g00ecdq,False,t3_i1lfh3,False,True,t1_g006qem,/r/usanews/comments/i1lfh3/lapd_releases_video_showing_protester_shot_in/g00ecdq/,False,,1604494338,1,True,False,usanews,t5_2rf3d,r/usanews,public,,0,[],

Jim crow or redlining for example wouldn't fall under the definition of a hate crime. Neither would harsher sentences or rougher police interactions. So I dont think it paints the entire picture here.

I think all of that is a very worthy discussion. But I also think in many ways it highlights the apples to oranges comparison of discrimination each group has faced. Even within subgroups, Japanese-Americans with family who lived through American internment camps went through different experiences than families who migrated there after.

&gt; And I agree with your assessment that a lot of modern anti semitism is born out of a resentment toward the success of others. But that's almost better in a way. Who really hates jews? Poor trailer trash? People who can't act on these feelings in any way besides committing crimes? That might ultimately be an easier deal than being disliked by police and politicians; people who hold real power and influence in our institutions.

I think a lot of people don't know this, but a lot of the perpetrators of these attacks in America today are by blacks and other minority groups. There was an incident in 2019 where two black people shot up a kosher market and killed two Jews in New Jersey. Another one in 2019 where a black guy went into the home of Jews celebrating Chanukah in NYC and stabbed them with a machete. The reason for the spike in these attacks seems likely about socioeconomics, despite them ironically mostly targeting the ultra religious Jews who are generally pretty poor and oftentimes on welfare even.

Then you have the classic alt-right shootings like the Pittsburg synagogue.

In Europe, Jews have it really bad because you get a trifecta of antisemitism coming from extremist Muslims, the alt-right and the far left.

&gt; And to be clear I think ben shapiro cries wolf on this issue as a means to shut down the conversation, but I wouldn't make the that claim about everyone or even you, specifically. You seem to have been totally well reasoned throughout this whole discussion and not arguing from any sort of victimhood Olympics perspective.

There's definitely a lot of danger in having victimhood mentality ingrained into ones pathology. I'm very much against it. I actually got in a debate with a Jewish redditor one time who insisted on being viewed as a ""victim"" in the US, which is obviously absurd. This saddened me to hear, because I think the main driving force for Jewish success is having a positive attitude and trying to succeed as much as possible with whatever options are available, regardless of discrimination, like when they had a Jewish quota in American colleges. Anyone who has a victimhood complex, will likely think the world is rigged against them and not even try to succeed.

I much prefer to talk about the reasons behind the success of Jews, despite historical discrimination, rather than whine about being ""oppressed"" in the most welcoming place for diaspora Jews in the world.",True,False,False,,,,0,1596308321,,False,0,{},g00fcra,False,t3_i1rx29,False,True,t1_g009yy7,/r/samharris/comments/i1rx29/bari_weiss_was_on_bill_maher_last_night_and_yet/g00fcra/,False,,1604494845,2,True,False,samharris,t5_2thqg,r/samharris,public,,0,[],

* March 19, 2002 — Clinton was listed as flying from New York to London and then returning two days later.
* May 22, 2002 — Clinton flew from Japan to Hong Kong.

While there, he [worked](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/directors-forum-bill-clinton) on HIV and AIDS prevention projects, democratization, and economic development. He finished the trip in [England](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/2294147.stm), where he [addressed](https://web.archive.org/web/20021016130247/http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/10/02/clinton.labour/index.html) the [Labour Party](http://www.apimages.com/metadata/Index/Associated-Press-International-News-United-King-/9b441ab099e5da11af9f0014c2589dfb/18/0) during its annual conference. In a [2002 profile](http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/n_7912/) of Epstein, Clinton is quoted as saying through a spokesman, “Jeffrey is both a highly successful financier and a committed philanthropist with a keen sense of global markets and an in-depth knowledge of twenty-first-century science. I especially appreciated his insights and generosity during the recent trip to Africa to work on democratization, empowering the poor, citizen service, and combating HIV/AIDS.” According to the flight records, this was the longest trip Clinton took on Epstein’s plane, and it accounted for 11 of the 26 total flights.
* Nov. 4, 2003 — About a year after the Africa trip, Clinton took what appears to be his last trip on Epstein’s plane. He flew from Brussels to Oslo, where he had a two-day [visit](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/former-us-president-bill-clinton-shakes-hand-with-norwegian-news-photo/2699885?adppopup=true) with officials to [work](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/former-us-president-bill-clinton-talks-during-a-joint-press-news-photo/2697563?adppopup=true) on his project to prevent HIV and AIDS in developing countries.

The winners of the War: Nazi Germany that came to power in 2723 under the rule of  Wilfried Rogge, the Reunited Austro-Hungarian Empire that united under the rule of Oskar Ludwig Hubert Otto in 2728 with the help of the Germans, Nationalist Greece(that formed the Byzantine Empire) under the rule of Kiriakos Gounaropoulos which came to power in 2720, the Japanese empire under the rule of Fukuhara Matsuo and Sweden (that formed the Scandinavian Empire) under the rule of Önde Wahlström.

The Losers of the War: The United Kingdom under the rule of Chester Henderson, France under the rule of Jean-Louis Jacquemin, The Russian Republic (now known as Soviet Russia) that was under the rule of Shishlov Nikodim Rodionovich and now is under the rule of Zhutov Matvey Makarovich, America that was once united and was under the rule of Apollo Mccray, Mexico(now known as the Mexican Socialist States or MSS) that was under the rule of Gonzalo Nuñes and now is under the rule of Frenando Hernandez, Canada that was once united under the rule of Thomas Wilkinson and more countries (too lazy to put them all).

The Aftermath: 1- North American Explosion of Countries

After the Peace Treaty was signed, a lot of people were unhappy and protests started to pop up and the protests hit Canada,USA and Mexico, and Fascists and Communists saw a perfect opportunity to put those ideologies in power so after some time,Revolutions started and in the year 2742,July 25.

* The United States Government fell, leaving Countries to form and those Countries are: The California Republic, Confederacy of (some tribe name,forgot the name),Socialist Tribe Union, Middle East Union, Washington Brotherhood, Alaska State(Fascist Alaska), the Great Lakes Republic,Dakota,New England (and one more but forgot the name) but two small resistance appear and one created the Provisional American Government which is Democratic and formed in the South and the other one created the Fascist Government of America formed in the North;
* The year 2742, July 31, The Canadian Government fell and now there is a Communist Quebec, Canadian State (Fascist Canada) and the Northern District but a small resistance created the Provisional Canadian Government which is Democratic;
* The year 2742 August 3, The Mexican Government fell and now it is a Communist Mexico in the North and the Aztec Empire in the South.

2-South America

* Brazil is divided for the same reason as America and now there is the Monarchist Brazil and the Nationalist Brazil and the Republic of Amazonas/Amazonia;
* Gran Colombia and the Claws Squad- Colombia saw the perfect opportunity to expand and form Gran Colombia while the Majors were distracted and the Claws Squad is an uprising of some Venezuelan Soldiers trying to reconquer there land;
* Argentinian Reich is a Nazi Argentinian State in the South of Argentina and Argentina is now known as Ro de la PLata;
* Paraguay conquer some land when the Countries were distracted;
* Guyana the same as Paraguay;
* Uruguay the same as Paraguay.

3-Central American

* Honduras conquer San Salvador,Guatemala,Nicaragua,Belize and some parts of Mexico and formed the Centro America;
* Panama didn't do anything.

4-Africa

* Europeans colonized again Africa but there are still independent Nations that some formed unions like the East African Union which is Fascist, Western Africa which is Democratic and the Central African Union which is Communist to protect themselves of the Europeans and the ones who didn't unite was South Africa which is Democratic and the Islamic Arabian Union which is Islamic.
* Nazi African Puppets- The Nazis conquer some land and created those Reichkommissariat puppets and the German East Africa

3-4 decent eyepieces can go a long way (Overview, planets, in-between).

E.g. the 6mm, the 25mm kit is okay for an overview, and 1-2 in-between (e.g. the 15mm 66° and 9mm 66° - there's also a set  of 6-9-15-20 but the 20mm would be redundant).

That’s entirely the point. Everyone agrees that’s racist. Tons of people view racism mainly through that lens and other similarly overt forms of racism without any ulterior motive or bad faith. That’s the sort of racism that, like you said, is obvious and easy to identify by pretty much everyone. 

But there are many more forms of racism that aren’t as overt, and they are still horrific and damaging. Those aren’t as easy to see and identify by those who haven’t lived that experience and/or examined its societal impact. 

Bad faith actors also use that limited lens of racism as plausible deniability and use the incredibly high level setting of racism as a starting point for luring people to even more clearly racist ideas and ideologies.

I’m thinking of stuff like the white nationalist movement. They say they aren’t racist. They just want to ensure America maintains the white European culture they say it was founded upon. They say that keeping things racially homogenous makes societies better. They say they don’t have anything against black people and other non-white groups — it’s just humanity’s nature instinct to want to be among their own race. They can live among themselves.

If you believe the bar for what is considered racist to an insanely high bar akin to overt acts like lynching or shouting the n-word at people in public, then these obviously racist white nationalist ideas wouldn’t cross that threshold for you. 

You can truly believe these things and still be convinced you’re not racist. The bad faith actors, meanwhile, can push these ideologies with plausible deniability when called out on their racism and can respond with faux outrage over being called racist. “Why do you call everyone who disagrees with you racist?!!”

The European wakes up eager to start his virtuous European day and immediately a thought pops into his head. AMERICANS. This of course is a daily occurrence without fail.  ""I wonder what those stupid Americans are up to,"" he thinks as he instinctively opens up his favorite American website Reddit from his iPhone. He scrolls and scrolls seeking an opening to talk about America, anything to latch on to. He's totally not obsessed with Americans. He becomes bored so he turns his TV on and opens up Netflix. He puts on his favorite marvel movie for the billionth time and he goes back to scrolling. He loves engaging in American culture as he bashes America. He's totally not obsessed. He gets hungry and reaches for his iphone to order breakfast from McDonalds using uber eats. “Stupid Americans making me eat their shitty food,” he thinks to himself, “European food is so much better not even close.” He has eaten KFC 3 out of the last 5 nights for dinner. He waits downstairs for his food so he decides to put on some American rap music. “Ugh stupid Americans,” he says “their culture is such shit! Not like European culture, we have history! and long-standing traditions. True culture comes from the wealthy!” A Muslim family crosses his path and he pretends to not be afraid and gives them a friendly nod and a wave. “WAAAOOOO” he thinks as he smirks so self-satisfied “I bet if this was America they would have shot them lol.” “Us Europeans are much more open-minded and civilized.” He nods agreeing with himself. His food arrives and makes his way back upstairs as he slurps down the coke Americans have forced him to drink. As he sits down to enjoy his shitty American food his Iphone receives an alert. NEW ZEALAND NOW HAS ZERO CORONAVIRUS CASES! “Oh my fucking god!"" He yells! ""I am so gonna rub this in their stupid American faces!” He tweets, he posts on Instagram. He jumps on Reddit and comments with furor and xenophobia. He never really congratulates New Zealand or their success but instead talks about how Americans will all die from COVID and how they are all so stupid. The European posts charts and graphs he has archived to link when he is questioned. Hes totally not obsessed with America. Dont even joke around like that. Hes cooming with joy. “I really showed those stupid Americans today” he says to himself “they fucking deserve it, god damn imperialists,” he says without a shred of irony. Felling extra good about his exploits he decides to go out and enjoy his blessed, virtuous, pretentious Euroday. He laces up his Jordans nice and tight.

The actual number is hard to get, because incredibly, the US government does not mandate reporting of these statistics, and we have to rely on third party reporting from media sources, which is itself astonishing.

The figure you're citing is the number of fatal police shootings.  This number is an order of magnitude higher on a per-capita basis than any other peer country.  It's not even in the ballpark with any other developed country. It's just astronomically higher than anywhere else.  When you compared it to the UK on a per capita basis, it's ~50x higher.  It's 10x higher any country in Europe, including Russia.  It's simply incomparable with any other democracy anywhere in the world.  Only basket case countries have comparable numbers.  And indeed, on a per-capita basis, it's ~90x higher even than China.

So it's simply incredible to me how deeply people like your will droop to your knees to apologize for this singularly violent police force in the United States.  It is certainly not a small number.

But this actually minimizes the scale of the problem.  The police kill many more people than just those that they shoot to death.   Just as the police murdered George Floyd without shooting him, they kill many others without firearms.  The list of fatal encounters with the police is nearly double the list of fatal shootings - most recently 1,810 in 2019.

And this too is incomparable with anywhere else in the world.  And in this figure, there can be no excuses made about gun laws.  Other countries have criminals too, but somehow these encounters don't result in huge numbers of deaths.

And all of this is just the tip of the iceberg of the problem of policing in the US.  These are just fatal encounters.  There are countless more problematic encounters that don't result in a death.

If the police in the US did a better job at solving crimes, maybe there might be an argument to be made that all of this is somehow worth it.  But they don't.  The clearance rate for violent crime in the US is 45% - far lower than any other developed country.  The US has many more police per capita than Canada, we imprison 5x as many people, yet Canada has a 63% violent crime clearance rate.

The police in the US are not just extraordinarily violent compared to peers, and the US not only imprisons huge numbers of people compared to peers, we also solve far fewer crimes.

So what exactly is it that you're defending?  What is the good thing the police in the US are doing?  And have you ever lived outside of this country?  Because by whatever metric you want to use, policing in the US is simply terrible.

&gt;	Differences in per capita income between the richest and poorest countries were only just above 3 to 1 in 1820 (with income measured in dollars and at constant prices). The gap grew over the 19th century: slowly at first, and then more rapidly until 1913. Inequality between nations continued to grow over the twentieth century, accelerating over the last forty years. The ratio of the average GNP per capita (1987 prices) of the richest countries with a fifth of the world’s population, to the GNP per capita of the poorest countries with a fifth of the world’s population, grew from 30 to 1 in 1960 to 60 to 1 in 1990, and to 74 to 1 at present.

https://www.wider.unu.edu/publication/global-inequality-0

Note how since the 60s, the gap between rich and poor has actually increased quite a lot. (The book *Bad Samaritans* by Ha-Joon Chang is a brilliant read related to this)

Places like India and China actually had higher GDP per capita than countries like Britain and France up to the 18th century. Latin American lost potentially 95% of its indigenous population after European arrival, to both direct genocidal violence and European disease. Mexico didn’t recover to its precolombian population levels until the 1800s. Millions of kilograms of metals were extracted from the region, providing a windfall of capital for Europe to transition to industrial foundations and further trade with Asia (which would eventually outsource Europe’s land and labor intensive production, thus freeing up capital and labor for industrial production). China, given its relatively strong status at the time, turned away a bulk of goods trading, stating they didn’t want British goods. This led to a major trade deficit, where Britain needed Chinese goods, but they had to pay with capital (silver) since China didn’t want their goods.

This not sitting well with the British, as they needed a market for their goods production, they took to selling opium from their colony, India, to China. This kickstarted the Opium Wars, which eventually led to Britain winning and imposing various trade regulations and tariffs, thereby making British goods much more competitive in China, giving them the consumer market they so desired, but as well weakened China’s position (this when China also lost Hong Kong to Britain). The result of these wars would go on to be called the unequal treaties.

This all very shallow, and doesn’t get into Indian colonization, colonization of the Americas, the scramble for Africa, natural resources, geography, institutions, why the industrial revolution was British, etc.

One remarkable quote related to Africa from Cecil Rhodes, a key British colonialist:

&gt;	‘The Empire is a bread and butter question’, Cecil John Rhodes declared in 1895. He had just attended a meeting of the unemployed in the East End of London and his journalist friend, W. T. Stead, recorded his impressions. ‘I listened’, said Rhodes,
to the wild speeches, which were just a cry for ‘bread! bread!’ and on my way home I pondered over the scene and I became more than ever convinced of the importance of imperialism…. My cherished idea is a solution for the social problem, i.e., in order to save the 40,000,000 inhabitants of the United Kingdom from a bloody civil war, we colonial statesmen must acquire new lands to settle the surplus population, to provide new markets for the goods produced in the factories and mines.

I’d definitely recommend everyone check out these books, which together provide a decent framework:

*Why the West Rules for Now* by Ian Morris

*The Divide* by Jason Hickel

*Why Nations Fail* by Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson

Ideally, read all three, as they examine different aspects. 

*Why the West* argues from a more geographical position, and is a long view history (fascinating historical read, explanatory argument aside). Although, it argues geography explains a lot, the history is not all geographical, and is a great world history book

*The Divide* focuses post-1500 and largely post-1800, examining from a more colonialism, imperialism, unequal trade and exploration side. Especially how the structures of that still have influence today. Interesting read for the inadequacies of modern development theories. Fascinating look behind that quote at the start of this comment about how modern gaps between rich and poor countries are growing, and that we are not quite in a “catching up” period like many narratives suggest we are.

*Why Nations Fail* looks more at institutions, and the roles they play. This takes a more political inclusivity point of view, in terms of explanatory power.

All the books discuss the various aspects, but lean a bit more into one side vs the others.",True,False,False,,,,0,1596315901,,1596316340,0,{},g00tw6a,False,t3_i1ttlu,False,False,t1_g0060m8,/r/MapPorn/comments/i1ttlu/thought_this_would_fit_here/g00tw6a/,False,,1604502445,15,False,False,MapPorn,t5_2si92,r/MapPorn,public,,0,[],

Due to this poor degree of containment, the daily deaths in the US is far higher than those of European countries.

But the idea is that fossil fuels need not disappear altogether, because as you said, wind, solar, and some other renewables cannot be used as baseline power sources for extended periods of time.

&gt;Besides, when I made that point, it was in the context of biblical times when it was indeed basically impossible to tell if someone was infertile without sexual intercourse.

And that's part of the problem. Why do we still apply rules that follow the context of times hundreds of years ago? Many of them don't make any sense in modern times. We don't follow the rules of the Old Testament after all, looking at ""wearing clothes of different wools is a sin"" and all that. The only difference is that there's no Jesus nowadays to tell us to disregard those.

&gt;Indeed but it's not like the Polish government is doing that so what's your point? It's not illegal to be gay in Poland, they're just not allowed to marry which is the case in every Central-Eastern European country as far as I know.

Yes, and that's what those people are protesting for.

&gt;Well, no they can't. Laws are man-made, they were written by people like you and I, while the Bible is believed to have divine character, it's the word of God.

To burrow a quote from a great series, ""The Bible isn't an iPhone...anything that can be upgraded eventually ends up in the bin, only to be replaced by a new model. The Bible has endured for a very long time and its value has changed little, if at all.""

But we are not Muslims. We don't believe for the Bible to be the exact word of God. It's a report of events that allegedly happened at that time and a testament of the workings of God and Jesus Christ, but it was still written down by normal people. And just like laws, those words can change their meaning over time. Nothing like that is ever static, the Bible would be a pretty bad book if it couldn't adapt to the different times.

The centaurs are not literally the Ojibwe people for example, but if you accept them as an analogue for First Nation peoples (intentional or not), then it stands to reason that Argo and Fitz do not need to literally have white skin for them to be an analogue of whiteness in the world which has been created.

For me the white coding of Argo and Fitzroy (whether or not they actually have white skin), is that they're operating in a culture which remains analogous to a lot of the structures and values that originated in Europe.  Obviously this world's focus on accounting is significantly more hyperbolic than what we see in our world, but at its core, the dominant culture here is still a pretty straight analogue to white Eurocentric culture.   

Argo and Fitz operate within that cultural demographics and (I may be wrong) we haven't seen any real signals that they have other cultural markers that would separate them.  So while the may not be 'white', they are still filling the role of the 'white' in the white savior narrative.

""Immigration is a public good and the UK should accept more immigrants""

The current leader of the UK labour party has literally called for a reduction in immigration to the UK. Completely false.


On France your statement is generally misleading. First of all France's ""private"" care is NON-PROFIT which makes it radically more progressive than what Biden is suggesting and even then the government pays around 77% of healthcare costs. Secondly the ""Socialist Party"" in France is not actually socialist and not even considered progressive but center-left (although more leftist under previous leader Hamon). Some members of the PS also want to nationalize healthcare and if you look at the actually progressive or leftwing parties so do they

By the way in Scandinavia and other Nordic countries, the UK and Spain (at least these are just the ones I know of. Iirc Portugal+more too) you do NOT have an option. You are FORCED to pay for public health insurance and then you are allowed to by (supplemental) private health insurance on the side. Your statement about both private+public option is VERY wrong.

On to the Spanish Socialist Party. It has more progressive credentials than the French one but generally also only considered center-left with Podemos being the real progressive/left party. I rly hope you are not trying to exploit some people's ignorance of EU politics to show fellow Americans that Biden is progressive compared to European """"progressive"""" parties. It should also be noted that it matters a lot HOW the money is spent as you should know from Trump's corona """"bailouts"""".

And again you misrepresent the policy you mention. The Spanish government is planning a direct investment of 53 billion BUT will generate 200 billion in total investment which is more ambitious than Biden's plan in terms of population and a lot more when accounting for the smaller size of Spain's economy. And that's not even adressing how foolish it is to believe Biden will actually fight for his plan. By the way the Spanish government is doing his after ALREADY phasing out coal and making progress on climate change in general. Once again a lot more progressive than Biden.

And again you lie! In Germany public universities are already tuition free and they have even made it free for foreigners too!!! Largely BECAUSE the Greens AND the SDP pushed for it. And this is even though the German Social-Democrats are known for being even MORE conservative than the French ones even participating in some cuts to the welfare state with the conservative CDU party. If you want a progressive/left party at least use the Greens or even more aptly Die Linke (which is far-left/very progressive).

Lie after lie after lie.

Italy was a good cherry pick for this one being notorious for relatively backwards LGBTQ policy. On LGBTQ+ even most center-right and even many rightwing parties in Western Europe and most centrist parties in Europe as a whole support rights for LGBTQ+ ppl. In Scandinavia/Nordics and most other Western European countries the government (or ""private"" insurance where applicable) pays for sex reassigent surgery. 

Even in Italy which is behind on this issue you can still legally change your gender since 82 and civil unions between same-sex ppl are legal. And they were the 2nd country in the world to elect a trans person to parliament in 06. They are also about to pass anti-discrimination laws even with a more centrist party being the biggest. This is NOT progressive by European standards. This is the lowest bar.

In Sweden the SAP is again pretty centrist but being pro 2-state solution is again an insanely low bar and not  particularly progressive. It is literally official UN policy and every European country has supported it under both left and right governments.

Switzerland is AGAIN a cherry pick being notorious for their relatively very pro gun politics. However once again this is still a bad example!

Switzerland has: Background checks for both weapons and ammunition, weapon registration, magazine caps AND they voted for the EU gun ban which is miles ahead of anything even proposed in the US that I know of. This isn't even in the ballpark of Joe Biden (or Bernie Sanders for that matter). Another rotten cherry/misrepresentation from the bunch.

Even with you cherrypicking you end up mostly lying and then you woefully misrepresent/misunderstand the rest. I rly don't know if it's worse if you're arguing in good faith or in bad faith here and even witht the ridiculous cherry-picking I can't quite tell if you just poorly researched/skimmed old articles/wikipedia from google or not. Either way this might be the worst take or example of an American explaining European politics i have seen to date and in no way did you prove your point (or earn your steaming condecension).

Also the populist right is growing IN SOME COUNTRIES. For an example in Denmark where I'm from the populist right lost over half their support in the last election in 2019 and lost even more since. Saying the far-right is growing ""in Europe"" is definetly an oversimplification. Also most of ur articles are from 16 and outdated. Not to mention you literally have Trump in office in the US.

Joe Biden is not a progressive. He never was, he isn't now and I don't think he ever will be. In Denmark there is not a single party, not even the most extreme rightwing party which is polling to be voted out of parliament next election (barely made 2% of the vote last time), that DOESN'T support fully tax-paid nationalised healthcare. We also not only provide free university but also pay students a wage for going to university. 

Biden literally wouldn't even make it into the most ragingly anti-immigrant, anti-EU anti-almost everything decent party in my country because he is, in fact, SO far right (by our standards) on many issues. I should probably note that despite this I think he is preferable to Trump and would prob vote for him at this point in november if I could. Though your comment is is still a horrible write-up and the Democrats in general are still, mostly, rightwing in Europe, sorry.

It's time to reconsider your views on Europe (and the Democrats it would seem).

Some marginal fractions are doing better: the ultra orthodox get more money to contribute less, and the settlers get more money to cause more instability, and of course, the rich is getting richer. But everyone else is not doing that great. Politically, Israel has been doing very poorly as well—losing much of her unconditional allies in Europe and has been isolated, with growing criticism to Israel’s lack of interest in resolving the Palestinian conflict and refusing to freeze the settlements. Security-wise, you are kind of right, but there is no long term strategy or an effort to find a long lasting solution. I may also add that Israel has never been more socially divided. Netanyahu is ripping the country from the inside, with high levels of reported racist incidents, stronger frictions between orthodox and secular, between various people across the political spectrum, and an ever more marginalized Arab population. In all, the narrative that is painted is not nearly as nice as Netanyahu likes to depict.

There are a number of reasons why people think this way.

The first reason is, FNC and G2 who were head and shoulders above everyone previous years have been slumping. On the other hand, the rest of the league got way, way better so it makes G2 especially look worse than they actually are(FNC is actually bad rn). So they see it as if EU has no good teams right now.

The second reason is, people are less critical of LCK/LPL teams mistakes because simply not many non-fans watch these games, only their niche fans. The good plays get glorified big time especially in the region where ""strongest"" team/teams are, specifically LPL this time.

The third reason is, that some of the fans of LCK/LPL also want to feel superior/hipster by calling the mainstream Western teams garbage and some of the fans of the Western teams who don't have an eye for the game eat this shit up and actually believe it.

Previous years, mostly these have been the reasons for the underrating of the EU teams except for the first reason which is only for this split. Pre-2018 it was understandable because we didn't do much but nowadays it's just funny.

There's like 50+ days until Worlds, G2 have been on an upward spiral these last 2 weeks, Rogue pre-15 mins are actually fucking good, if they shore up their mid-game they will also be very good, MAD are already a very good team and the 4th team, who knows who it'll be, but usually the last seed always gets insanely underrated and they almost always show up at Worlds (G2, Splyce from past 2 years).

Quem sabe ler symbolos e apprende dos simbolos maçonicos sabe que o convento tem algums symbolos usados pelos maçons. Apos saber se foi os maçon que influencaram os templarios ou o contrario isso nao sei.

Para quem nao sabe quem sao os maçons :

Maçons eram pedreiros ou architetos que construisiam cathedrais, igreijas e templos. Os maçons diziam que tinham ums conhecimentos segredos uma Gnosia o Gnosis que se transmitiam pela tradicao oral desde da prehistoria.  Nas tradicoes orais deles eles dizem que a organisacao é muito mais velha que 1717. Os maçons dizem ser os heredeiros de Hiram Abiff o construtor do templo de Deus em jerusalem (templo  de salomao). E que seria maçons do egyptio que construisiram as pyramides e muitos templos antigos no mundo inteiro. O problema é que nao se pode verificar isso tudo nao ha provas reais. Mas agente sabe de fato que eles eram construtores de cathedrais nos tempos medievais e que é possivel que eles construiram conventos e igreijas templares.

em quê acreditem os maçons ? Os maçons acreditem em varias coisas por exemplo : que cada religiao dos tempos antigos no mundo teem uma parte de verdade e que elas todas conteem indiços  para encontrar o criador do universo e para a salvaçao da alma. O numero mais importante deles é o numero 3 a santa trinidade é por isso que a pyramide é o symbolo deles.

O sol e a lua e o olho de ""Deus"" tmb sao.  O sol e a lua  dia e noite, maculino e feminino. Que podem ser connotados com o mundo material e o mundo spiritual. Eles accreditam que todo ser humano teem uma alma immortal divina que o Criador deu a cada homem e mulher. Que devemos fazer boas accoes, viver de forma equilibrada, e ser menos materialistas possiveis para accedir a immortlidade da alma e ajudar os outros a seguir o bom caminho. Para os maçons almas que sao materialistas o que nao atingiram um certo nivel de conhecimento spiritual sao reincarnadas o que é considerado uma maldiçao.  Mas isso depende das lojas e dos maçons ha tmb maçons gnosticos como os cathares que acreditam que ha duas divinidades uma spiritual e de luz e outra malefica material que emprisonou o spiritual dentro do material e que é a origem da reincarnaçao. Os ensinos de Cristo seriam entao a chave da salvaçao para o mundo espiritual. O corpo physico seria obra dessa divinidade malefica e a alma espiritual esteria fechada na prisao material do corpo.

A maçoneria inventou a democracia republicana moderna foram eles que fizeram cair as primeiras monarquias no mundo. Os philosophos Lumière (luz) : Voltaire montesquieux Diderot etc eram a quase todos maçons. A maioria das republicas no mundo existam por causa dos maçons. A republica portuguesa e a revolucao 25 de abril foi em segredo organisada pelo varias organisacoes como a maçonica. Se algum ver à declaracao universal dos direitos humanos que fois realizada apos da revoluçao françesa, ela tem muitos symbolos maçonicos :

Paris é considerada la ville lumière (A cidade Luz) por causa do fato que é a capital maçonica du Mundo. É la que os dejesos duma républicaine baseada sobre os philosophos lumière nasceu. O fato que à tour eiffel é uma pyramide nao é hasar o architecto era maçon :

https://www.google.ch/amp/s/amp.lefigaro.fr/culture/2012/07/20/03004-20120720ARTFIG00279-paris-capitale-maconnique.php 

A maioria dos monumentos em Paris sao Obras maçonicas : Durante a primeira republica 50% dos homems politicos do governo portugues eram maçons :    [https://www.rlmad.net/secmaconaria/pranchas/breve-historial/](https://www.rlmad.net/secmaconaria/pranchas/breve-historial/) . Hoje em dia em muitos governos republicanos eles teem ainda muita influenca e poder. Mas quem é rational o sabe bem a governanca republicana nao é realmente uma democracia é uma forma de oligarchia elitica que é promovida pela democracia popular a eleitores : elites escolhidas pelo partidas. O unico verdadeiro systema democratico é o systema suiço onde o povo decide mesmo de tudo. Pode mudificar leis ou criar novas leis com 100’000 assinaturas.

O grande problema com a maçoneria e a igreija catholica era o fato que para os Maçons a salvacao nao passava pela figura de Cristo mas pelo si mesmo. E muitos maçons nao accreditam na divinidade de cristo, Mesmo se existe maçons catholicos ha maçons judeus, hindus, boudhistas, muçulmanos, etc  é por isso que a igreija catholica considera os ensinos maçonicos incompativeis com os catholicos. Outro problema é que os maçons usam symbolos controversais como o pentagram inversado que na tradicao catholica e considerada como o symbolo do diabo. Um grande problema é o fato que o symbolo da masonaria é um triangulo equilateral que tem 3 angulos de 60 degraus ora com 60+60+60 muitos pensaram em 666. mas o mais grande problema é que os maçons sao pessoas com poder e dinheiro e que eles teem muita influença no mundo politico o que pode parecer perigoso. Eles teem uma tradicao que lhe diz que ajudar um maçon e mais importante que tudo mesmo se for contra as leis que nao forem maçonicas. Exemplo do problema durao Baroso é maçon ele ja o disse varias vezes muitos membros politicos sao outro exemplo é que approximativemente 30% dos deputados europeus sao maçons.

A coisa mais controversada e que é mesmo fato historico e nao pura invençao (Na villa nova de Ourem algums velhotes ainda se lembram dessa historia que os pais deles lhe contaram) é o fato que apos dos acontecimentos do milagre de fatima os carbonarios portugueses (maçons) dinamitaram a primeira capela do sitio sagrado e cortaram o tronco da azinheira das aparicoes e fizeram um cortegio come ele. é por isso que nao ha mais azinheira das apparicoes hoje. Depois ouve pessoas que cortaram pedacos do resto do tronco para levar peças da arvore come eles. Eles que consideravam partes d'um evento santissimo e magico. tudo é contado aqui :

Quem sabe ler os symbolos maçonicos e os apprende e que ja tem uma grande cultural geral nunca mais vai ver o Mundo da mesma maneira. O que pode ser mesmo um perigo para as pessoas com fraca mente que podem acabar em depressao. 

Apprender esses conhecimentos occultos sao um choque psychologico para cada homem : com e sem fê. Porque depois uma Pessoa raçional compriende que fatos historicos ensinados e attestados nao sao bem como sao contados e ensinados.

Um exemplo disso é que à revoluçao communista de Lenine e dos bolschevicos tem originem maçonica o que nao é contado nos ensinos academicos de historia. Esse professor de historia Phd no USA conta isso tudo ai : 

https://www.thegreatcoursesdaily.com/what-role-did-freemasons-and-bolsheviks-play-in-the-russian-revolution/

Eu nao aconselho ninguem a os apprender. Eu apprendi pelo simples curiosidade porque me interessei a problematica templaria e a ordem de cristo em Portugal. As vezes me digo que essa curiosidade nao foi Nada boa porque uma pessoa vai apprender que o Mundo que ela pensava conhecer nao é Nada do que ela pensava.

Quem sabe ler os symbolos maçonicos e vê o santuario de fatima desde da vista satelite ao ceu vai compreender que a igreija catholica romana nao é o que ela pretende ser... e quem vai comprender que seja agnostico ó religioso vai ter um choque. 

Algums Maçons dizem que a ordem do templo e muitos ordems militares catholicos fazem parte deles :

Onde esta a verdade ? quem sabe...

Mas nao aconselho ninguem entrar num desses grupos occultos. Cada um pode accreditar em o que ele quizer e deve ser uma liberdade fundamental.

The Spaniards spoke of ""vineyards"" referring to plantings of the maguey (agave) plant from which pulque is made. And various sorts of ""wine"" were described by the early Europeans in Mesoamerica: one from bananas in eighteenth-century Guatemala, another from pineapples in the West Indies, palm wine from the coyol palm trunk (manufactured from Veracruz to Costa Rica), and the balche of the Mayan area, made from a fermented tree bark.

But it is stretching the truth. The scientific reasoning behind the theory is strong and is based on techniques that have been demonstrated to work on more recent, better documented languages.

He often brings home really big carps, catfishes, pikes and sanders. Nevertheless, what I liked the most were the carps, the golden giants.

A year ago, I was at home, jerking off to some porn when I heard my dad outside, joyfully coming home with his friends. I quickly turned porn off and turned Skyrim on. My father's squad came in, I left my computer to greet them and then I saw that my father was holding a trophy of a 9-kilogram carp. I shared his triumph. Dad left the carp at home and went to the bar with his friends. I stayed at home alone and I decided to have a better look at the carp.

It was still alive and was moving its giant mouth. I imagined, idk why, that carp blowing me. Then I felt an erection. I think you can already guess what I did, I fucked the carp in its mouth with remarkably meaty lips, and I came right into its mouth. Doing so, I felt an extraordinary pleasure.

I forgot about this case later, especially since my father sold that carp at the market. However, when my father was bringing small carps weighing a kilogram or two, I started fucking them, too. I fucked carps and European carps all year long, and fucking smaller carps felt better because their mouths fitted my dick precisely. I loved fucking them while they were still alive, moving their lips around my cock. Over the span of half a year, I fucked, probably, more than 40, maybe even 50 carps. I fucked them several times a day, nutted into their assholes, idk why, sometimes I fucked them again when they were already frozen in a refrigerator, but that was for a rainy day. I even tried to fuck a bream once but its mouth was too small. I fucked a chub once, but still, the carps were the best for me, and whenever my father asked me what he should aim to catch tomorrow, I convinced him to get carps, allegedly because their meat tastes very good.

Here's what happened next. My father hadn't been fishing carps for a week. I hadn't been fucking carps for a week. I was walking in a daze, I really wanted to fuck a new fish, I thought about catching a carp myself but I was too lazy and furthermore, I hate fishing. My father only brought one small pike over the span of the week, probably because it was late Fall and he said that it wasn't interesting to catch carps at that time or something. I remember him seemingly starting to suspect something about my carp-mania by I was talking my way out as if I just liked the taste of it and that was it.

My father brought home an 8-kilogram catfish. I really wanted to fuck with a fish and so I started considering that catfish. Why not, its mouth was fine, except for the teeth, but it generally couldn't do anything, only scratch if you strongly press against it, tops. I thought that that would do it. I got my dick exposed, jerked it a little and put in the mouth of the catfish still alive, which by the way was in a bowl of water, and started fucking it. I fucked it for a little more but after a minute, a terrible thing happened. The catfish squeezed my cock and seemingly tried to rip it off, but didn't manage to, it just swiped its teeth against my dick really hardly. I pulled it out immediately, it was all scratched badly as fuck, it was bleeding, I hit the catfish with my leg and it fell in the bowl of water. Blood was streaming from my dick. I fucking bandaged it, put spirit on it. Then I wiped the blood off from the floor. The dick was aching really badly. It swelled up, but later it healed up, some scars were left though. It was a good thing that nobody found out that I fucked fish and had a bandage on my dick. So, my dick healed up completely after a month. I haven't fucked anything through the whole winter and then in Spring my father started bringing carps from fishing again, and I started fucking them again. I fucked the last carp two days ago. Top of that, boobs and generally girls don't turn me on anymore, but I get hard instantly whenever I see a carp's face.

Something I'd like to generally point out on this front is that there is basically no ""active"" equivalent to stealth. The problem is that the way you'd do it is to destructively interfere with the radar waves incident on the aircraft, which would then require two key things:

* The ability to communicate faster than the speed of light. In order to be able to create the destructively interfering wave exactly 180 degrees out of phase, you need to know what the incident wave is and emit the interfering wave at exactly the time it is incident with the aircraft. Since having to wait until after incidence would mean that you are out of phase with the new incident wave, this requires FTL to do.

   Notably, you do have to (against a modern radar threat) constantly be observing the new waveform, as modern radars rapidly and randomly vary the frequency, phase, and amplitude of the emitted radiation, and getting the jamming frequency wrong would fail to interfere and would instead make you show up extremely clearly.
* The ability to emit the interfering wave over the entire skin of the aircraft. Since the incident waveform reflects off of all parts of the aircraft, to interfere with it destructively you need to emit the jamming signal from every part of the airframe. While not as major of an issue as the requirement for FTL communications, this does require that the entire outside of the aircraft be made out of transmit modules, which is difficult from an engineering point of view.

If you're not talking about ""active"" stealth or cancellation, then we can't make a meaningful comparison between European and American systems. Both the US and European platforms offer sophisticated DECM packages, with the US arguably having a better OECM offering, with the key differentiation being in software and details of the RF architecture that are not publicly revealed. For example, the F-35 carries the ASQ-239 ESM system and the APG-81 is widely thought to contain substantial ECM capability organic to the system. However, beyond these wide strokes, we have no real way of knowing what the system is or what it does, so all we can realistically say is that both US and European platforms have ECM/ECCM/ESM packages available to them.",True,False,False,,,,0,1596326437,,False,0,{},g01c07o,False,t3_i1kz9c,False,False,t1_g017md4,/r/LessCredibleDefence/comments/i1kz9c/deadline_to_submit_bids_to_build_canadas_next/g01c07o/,False,,1604512419,3,True,False,LessCredibleDefence,t5_2yyyd,r/LessCredibleDefence,public,,0,[],

By 2025, Starlink should yet reach 11 943 satellites and should be compared to the 8 000 satellites humanity has already put in orbit since Sputnik, only 2 218 are still operating right now. 

The pharaonic predation of ressources and energy for producing satellites, transport them, to launch them, pilot them and using them is catastrophic.
In addition millions of special antennas will be produced, transported and installed for the consumers of this web around the world. Starlink has already pre-ordered 1 million antennas ! 

But there's more, Kuiper by Amazon (who has just been given the permission to launch 3000 satellites) ,  OneWeb by billionaire Greg Wyler, and the Chinese brand  Hongyan will be in competition soon for the same market launching their own additional fleets of satellites and antennas. 

All that indeed induces a risk of bothering scientific observation but there is also a real risk of collision :
 2 september 2019, European Space Agency was forced to maneuver one of its earthwatcher scientific satellites in order to avoid collision with a Starlink satellite. 

Each one of the satellites is estimated to have a life expectancy of 5 to 7 years, six satellites of the fleet are already our of service because of malfunction problems, thousands of spatial debris will be added to the pre existant surveilled 20000.
A big part will fall and pollute oceans and soil. 

 9 mars 2020, Elon Musk announced that, thanks to Starlink, "" clients will be watching movies in high definition, playing video games and making whatever they want » is it worth it? 

&gt;what about Tesla and its drive to forward renewable energy and electric cars?

There are a lot of electric cars in European countries that are less energy intensive and way less expensive

&gt;They may not have invented these ideas but they are helping to bring the technology to the masses. 

Definetly not to the masses, maybe 20% go people maximum that can afford a Tesla, not to mention that we are waging a coup in Bolivia just to extract the huge amount of lithium necessary for a few high end luxury cars... 

&gt;Can't imagine anyone not hyped to see a rocket land itself or who fails to understand the economics

 given the previous arguments I mentionned, who is misunderstanding economics? A singular reusable rocket is not enough to counterbalance the damage that this megalomaniac greedy investor (not in a'y way an inventor but sure enough inveStor) will cause to our limited ressources only to drive fast and have HD at holiday home for the few but coups, scarcity and pollution for the many. Not to mention that the gigantic amount of chemicals and fuel is not reusable, you actually have to refill it each time.

They seem to indeed have better policy than the US or China, but that’s a very low bar. More importantly, even if one of the most extolled and seemingly harmless Euro states like, let’s say Sweden, really is a fantastic and harmonious place to live, there are some things we have to remember: 

1. However unionized and ethical the workplace might be in Sweden, the people still buy products from countries with unethical practices, and there are still Swedish companies that have factories and operations in countries with few labor rights. So even if they’re ethical to their own people, they exploit foreigner workers. Their slaves are beyond their borders. 

2. Euro countries like Sweden are able to spend more money on welfare and little on military expenditures because they know that other countries’ militaries would defend them in the case of a real threat. This means tacit support for the US, UK, French, etc militaries, which we all know engage in imperialism. Sweden isn’t in NATO at present, so it *seems* neutral, but Snowden leaks have revealed that Sweden cooperates with American and British intelligence agencies (see the top secret UKUSA Agreement, where Sweden has agreed to work with the NSA). Even if this weren’t the case, there’s little doubt that, if aggressed, Sweden would be defended by the other Euro/NA powers, and their low military spending is clearly informed by this belief. 

3. Sweden was ethnically homogeneous until very recently, so we still have to see how they’ll deal with increasing diversity. We’ve recently seen a rise of far-right hate groups, so it doesn’t seem they’re doing spectacularly so far. The 2011 Norway attacks may not have been in Sweden, but they were right next door in a country with a similar culture and nearly mutually intelligible language. 

4. Swedish companies are known, just like elsewhere, to escape paying taxes by using tax havens. We also know that Swedish banks, like other Euro banks, are associated with unethical practices and support human rights abuses. 

These are just some examples concerning one of the most lauded Euro states. The other countries in Europe seemingly have worse conditions.

It really turned him on and he decided to find her by visiting as many sex shop as possible. Because he was thinking like, ""so, in junior high school days she hated me, she never talked with me.

The 360 released November 2005, the PS3 a year later in Nov 2006, but Europe was March 2007, and EU was PlayStation's biggest market. So the 360 had an entire year's head start. Also worth noting, the Wii released at the same time as the PS3, but at 249$, so was a perfect entry-level console and much more kid-friendly.

Launch games were also pretty barebones compared to the 360. There were some decent exclusives, Resistance: Fall of Man and Ridge Racer 7, but a lot of the supposed non-exclusive launch titles were delayed because the Cell processor in the PS3 was exceptionally hard to work with, compared to the more developer-friendly 360. 360 launch had CoD 2, Dead or Alive 4, and Gears of War, which of course sold gangbusters.

I think the launch really hurt the PS3 in the long run. It took a long time for it to get up to 360 sales number (like you said, in the end the PS3 sold 87.4 million units and 360 around 86 million), and some of the tent-pole exclusives came much farther from launch than people wanted.

As mentioned, developers absolutely HATED the PS3, because development costs were so much higher than other consoles. A lot of big industry people were pretty public about their dislike for it (Gabe Newell, Bobby Kotick from Activision/Blizzard, and probably others), which garnered a lot of bad PR. It also got a lot of mixed reviews at launch, so all in all, there was a huge amount of negativity surrounding it. It did get more positive towards the end of its life cycle though.

All in all, it was a horrible launch, and Sony worked their booties off to correct it, but there were so many hurdles along the way (The leap year bug, constant weird PSN updates).

Inline skates are generally built to the requirements of [DIN EN 13843](https://standards.globalspec.com/std/1194291/DIN%20EN%2013843), where adult skates belong to ""Class A"" and have a rated weight limit of 100kg (\~220lbs) and children's' skates belong to ""Class B"" and have a rated weight limit of 60kg (\~132lbs). For a weight of 105lbs (\~48kg), there should be no issue with either class on that basis alone.

&gt;The project was under the direct command of a Dr. Sidney Gottlieb and received undisclosed but almost unlimited millions of dollars for hundreds of experiments on human subjects at hundreds of locations across the United States, Canada and Europe, the eventual budget for this program apparently having exceeded $1 billion per year. The evil in some of these MK-ULTRA documents is almost palpable, one such document from 1955 stating openly of a search for **“substances which will cause (temporary or) permanent brain damage as well as loss of memory”**. Part of the intent was to develop “techniques that would crush the human psyche to the point that it would admit anything”. In a US government memo from 1952, a program director asked, **“Can we get control of an individual to the point where he will do our bidding against his will and even against fundamental laws of nature, such as self-preservation?”** It also listed the wide range of horrid abuses to which the victims would be subjected. These people were not bashful about their intent.  
&gt;  
&gt;The mechanics included **primordial sex programming for women in attempts to eliminate learned moral convictions and stimulate primitive sexual instinct devoid of inhibitions, to create a kind of sex machine** – the ultimate prostitute for diplomatic espionage. Several researchers have claimed **the sexual appetite of these women was developed in young girls their formative years through constant incest with a government employee who had been deliberately developed as a father figure to the girls.** In part, these programs involved conditioning the human mind through torture, with one portion of this program intended to train special agents as fearless terrorists lacking self-preservation instincts and who would willingly commit suicide if caught. They even experimented with electronic implants, inaudible sounds, messages embedded in the subconscious mind, mind altering drugs and much more. One portion of this extensive operation involved an attempt to create an assassins program, to learn if it were possible to kidnap a national in another country, conduct hypnosis and other techniques, then return them home to assassinate their leaders.

I hope you read the first part of that last paragraph very carefully.  It is describing Epstein.  I think the matter is crystal clear at this point.  Sorry, I lost some of the polish of my initial post because I had to recreate it, but I think the point is still made.

Remember how the operatives who ran the brothels/safe-houses were financed by the intelligence agency mentioned above.  Epstein's cover was that he was a big shot investor, but it has since been revealed that he didn't do much trading.  He was funded by someone....There was also a provision for the operatives and their manipulated subjects to receive ""get out of jail cards"" as payment for their services.  The dots are all connected here, if you read up on the subject.

I want to point out that every time you see a major political or societal figure doing something that seems anti-human or against their previously stated morals, you might be seeing the results of this work.  Think back to a certain Supreme Court Chief Justice who was found dead with a pillow over his face.  Think to recent Supreme Court nominees, and how they have ruled in direct contradiction to their supposedly conservative roots (Roberts, Gorsuch, for instance) and have had questionable incidents happen (Gorsuch sexual assault allegations - this is how they compromise the people they select for positions of power).

There are 3 ways to qualify for the Europa League:

Finish fifth, win the FA cup or win the Carabao cup (EFL Cup; qualification for the EL Second qualifying round).


Now in that premier league table, wolves finished 7th. Places 1-4 are group stage qualification for the CL. Place 5 is group stage qualification for the EL. 

That’s straightforward right? But when the winners of the cups get into these places, things get complicated. 


Let’s take the EFL (Carabao) Cup first. If the team that won it gets into a Europe spot in the league or FA Cup, their qualification place (into second round) will be given to the next team WITHOUT a spot in Europe. Man City won the EFL cup. This means that Spurs who finished 6th gets that spot. 

Now remember that Arsenal too didn’t get a spot in Europe. But they’ve won the FA Cup which gets them a place in EL. This means that Wolves will not get a spot in Europe. Their only chance at Europe next year (CL) is if they win the current edition of the Europa league. That’s all. 

To make it clearer, think of what would’ve happened if Chelsea won the FA Cup. If they did, they should’ve gotten the EL. But they’ve already qualified for the CL. Which means the spots again shift one place below. Spurs will get the EL group stage qualification and Wolves will get the qualification into the second round qualifying.

Not always, but doing the application from the home country *could* make everything somewhat easier.

I feel like I have an outsiders view of both. Speaking about clubs as well as festivals. What country are you from? It varies a lot across Europe.

Payment isn't much different, just use a credit card for most things. Contactless isn't really a thing in the states yet, you'll probably have to swipe and sign, or use chip and pin. Some places will only take cash, so you need to carry both. Tipping is way more expected in the states - you'll be expected to tip any time you buy food or drinks from any vendor.

America is usually a younger crowd. In Europe it's common to see A LOT of people in their 40s or 50s out at clubs and festivals mixed with younger people. In America you'll see a few older people, but it's definitely a young persons scene with a large majority of people in their 20s or lower 30s.

People at festivals get way more dressed up in costumes in the states, you'll see tons of people wearing crazy outfits especially at EDC where people take costumes seriously. In Europe there's more people in just jeans and a t-shirt. I really noticed this when I went to a big European club in winter, I had on shorts and a brightly colored crop because I knew it gets hot inside. Everyone else was in jeans and dark long sleeves and I felt very out of place. If that artist had been in the states, people would have been in costumes for sure.

I'd say people drink more in Europe but they tend to drink more consistently over the day and don't get as drunk. It really depends on country and the club, like in the UK people tend to go out super early to drink and everyone's super wasted and it can be pretty aggressive by midnight. However in Germany, no one even bothers to leave the house until midnight and everyone always has a beer but no one's ever over the top. In the states it's very hit and miss, there's always someone who's too drunk, but way more people are noticably on substances. People tend to either drink seriously or not at all.

Way less smoking in the states. In many places in Europe you can still smoke inside.

For all of human history up to and including the 17th century, this was a common practice. Hell, it was still pretty common in most of the world even through WW2. The Japanese were notorious for their brutal raids on China during WW2, and they often took women and children as slaves (like the Natives did a couple centuries previously). Coincidentally, and contrary to the ""idealized"" interpretations of the responses and reactions of the Native populations to European settlers most Americans are taught, the Natives did not welcome the settlers with cornucopias of food and feasts. They fought. They raided. They murdered. And they enslaved them. Arguably, they were in the right, their lands were being invaded. But once the Europeans established a foothold, that whole dynamic quickly shifted against them as the Europeans had a significant advantage in technology.  


I know it's been painted in the decades since American expansion ended as if the white Europeans seemingly decided as a collective whole to exterminate the Natives, and in some cases that was true, like Jackson's Trail of Tears. But the reality of it all just isn't so clean-cut. Throughout the ""childhood"" of what became the United States, the colonists were at war with France, Spain, England, and a handful of other European powers seeking to seize control of the colonies from one another and the colonists themselves. During this period of turmoil the various major Native ""nations"" often chose sides, or were otherwise coerced, fighting against the colonies - for obvious reasons. But the overarching fact that has been swept under the carpet for whatever reason is that of declared war. The losses of territory, the creation of ""reservations"", all of that came as a direct consequence of waging war on the colonies. Not to say that the colonies, and later the US government weren't bastards, they routinely broke treaties and armistices over the flimsiest of justifications, but it was almost always resultant from war. Either the Natives would side with an enemy (Canada/France, Canada/Britain, Spain) trying to lay claim to the colonies, and lose. Or they would break (a more or less impossible) armistice because colonists would expand into their lands, like what's happening in Palestine now. And they would get their asses kicked for their trouble, and driven further West, and any POWs would be enslaved as was the general custom of humankind across the globe at the time. French, English, and Spanish soldiers also found themselves enslaved as well.  


But directly regarding your grossly oversimplified assertion that Roger Williams was a ""slaver"", the simple answer is ""nah man, read a fuckin book."" The current zeitgeist of condemning historic notables with the sensibilities of a 21st century college undergrad is ignorant as fuck. Sure, we now understand that enslaving POWs isn't a good thing to do, as is enslaving any human for any reason, but there is a vast gulf in motive and culpability between a 17th century European colonist taking an enemy combatant into slavery and a Dutch slaver paying a West African warlord for people that were purposefully captured to be sold as slaves. Much as there is nothing wrong with a plantation (go ahead, look it up, what even is a plantation, eh?), and there have been many plantations in every civilization throughout history. It's just a fucking big farm. Simply being labeled a ""plantation"" doesn't make a farm some sort of bastion of slavery.  


I do appreciate the elevated critical eye being trained on the history and lies of the ""American story"", it's incredibly important to rewire our society to inherently reject the sins of our ""fathers"".

&gt;  
&gt;“This is a unique situation where we as a company simply cannot take the risk if in ... four years the vaccine is showing side effects,” Ruud Dobber, a member of Astra’s senior executive team, told Reuters.  
&gt;  
&gt;“In the contracts we have in place, we are asking for indemnification. For most countries it is acceptable to take that risk on their shoulders because it is in their national interest,” he said, adding that Astra and regulators were making safety and tolerability a top priority.

&gt;EU officials told Reuters this week product liability was among contentious points in European efforts to secure supply deals for potential COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer, Sanofi and Johnson &amp; Johnson.  
&gt;

&gt;  
&gt;Astra’s deals differ from most rivals because it has secured government backing for production and development efforts, while competitors such as GlaxoSmithKline are looking to negotiate a price for a finished product, contingent on approval.  
&gt;  
&gt;To back its claim to forgo profits from the $1.2 billion collaboration in the United States, Astra has even granted the government access to financial accounts related to the venture, according to Dobber.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialismVCapitalism/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialismVCapitalism/)

Could you try these too ? I'm often posting to these and [https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/) (the name is reversed), with the attempt to argue that all people should have free land (the inalienable right to their equal value share of the natural resources) (which I happen to call “Market Socialism”, seemingly in contradiction to the usual definitions on reddit, which I think are too tightly defined).

In any case: I have long left the subreddits you mentioned, because of the regrettable behavior of the people there. I agree 100% with your assessment. Capitalists quickly call everyone who voices the slightest opposition a Communist, while conflating all other left wing ideologies with Stalinism. Communists are so dogmatic, I don't even bother with them anymore.

The one thing you left out was anarchists. I find this group to be the worst of them all. They have their own jargon and seem to call just about \*anything\* “The State” and once they do, they shut down. However they where already shut down, they even seem to be against law as such because it would require something “general” between people, that people would have to follow (to enforce it). Even “law” becomes “The State”. When you ask them how they could enforce their “Anarchy” law or principle, as if that isn't a law, I guess you get something like “the people who happen to be near a breach of the Anarchist principle there, will deal with it.” However I compute that for them, usually a debate with an Anarchist, in my experience, is a waste of time. For many years I have the rule to not debate an Anarchist, because of the time wasted. When asking someone about this, they told me the secret of Anarchism. *Anarchism is not logical, not an ideology, Anarchism is testosterone.* It is just a bunch of people who want to do whatever they want, and nobody should get in their way, or else. Trying is knowing ;-). Looking forward to your experience ! lol

On the Communists: I once was a member of NCPN (for reasons of protecting them against being prohibited by the European Union, which I disagreed with, and I sympathized with their newspaper, but left when my eyes literally hurt reading a fawning article about China). So then I changed my mind toward “Distributism” (which I made up my self), and even as a member all I got back was “you are naive” and they just stopped replying after that. This also happened with a Communist group from Belgium, who branded themselves as “Left Communism“, which means they oppose Stalinism (IKS, [https://world.internationalism.org/](https://world.internationalism.org/)). You just get shut down, they will not allow an ideological debate to reach their members, through something like a “letters to the editor” section. It doesn't matter if you have arguments. Hence, your Communist experience on Reddit seems to match experiences in the “real world”. IKS still sends me their letter, for free, which is rather sympathetic of them.

I feel like you: those in control want their chance at power, so they are highly dogmatic, and in need of controlling their flock to retain control. This is an issue which might plague every party and ideology. You could even argue that those in the top should be doing this, in order to maintain their ideological integrity, responsibility to their voter base. If they suddenly changed or started venting different propaganda, would their base even want to see it, or fear demoralization from their belief ? Still, I feel it is unfair. You should not fear a debate with opposing movements, rather you should welcome it. If you are sure about being right, what is there to fear ? Use opposing viewpoints to argue your case, and make it even stronger, or indeed change your mind if you discover you have been wrong.",True,False,False,,,,0,1596356353,,1596356734,0,{},g02it29,False,t3_i1qci6,False,True,t1_fzz5wkv,/r/distributism/comments/i1qci6/notes_from_talking_to_nondistributist_subreddits/g02it29/,False,,1604540800,2,True,False,distributism,t5_2u8gs,r/distributism,public,,0,[],

1) Egyptians as an ethnic group do not fall neatly between racial categories because Race is a socially constructed category that works best in Europe &amp; North America it does not work as well in the Middle East &amp; North Africa &amp; specifically not in Egypt. Some Egyptians by racial standards with alls their bloodlines taken into account since Ancient times would be considered black, others white.

2) Every Middle Eastern &amp; North African country underwent cultural erosion by the invading Arabs with little to no ties to their past. Egyptians for example had a complete culture that existed onto itself. Now we don’t even speak a language that’s directly linked to the ancient language, sure a few words here &amp; there survived &amp; Coptic became a liturgical for the Coptic church but that puts it a step below Latin which is also a liturgical language and was at some point a scientific lingua franca for Europe.

Are Egyptians brown?? Maybe. Does it matter if you can apply a specific racial category to Egyptians?? NO.

If you’re problem is the Ethiopian Dam and you’re trying to solve it through identity, Ethiopian’s arguing that they were the “real” Egyptians. Instead they’re arguing that we were a colonial power that was set on to attacking them and destroying them (which has some truth &amp; some lies to it which we won’t get into) and that we are opposing the Ethiopian dam because we want to “prevent Ethiopia from developing”.
That framing of the entire conflict is the REAL danger because while the Egyptian administrations since Sadat does try to play Neo-colonialists but Egypt is just as much the victims of Neo-colonialism as any other place.

I'm a supporter of the clean discussion, even though it's currently in a nascent, messy state. Some people can get really tribal about ""nature"" vs ""science"" (esp. on reddit, wow) which I think is unfortunate and unnecessary, but I'm looking forward to seeing where clean beauty is going. Because looking down the road, I think it'll ultimately lead to: 

* An expansion of the scientific knowledge base
* Better-informed consumers
* More products on the market suitable for various skin sensitivities and health concerns
* Shift in focus from clean &gt; safe, period, regardless of natural/synthetic 
* More sustainable and ethical products 
* Safer products available around the world for consumers who aren't living in the US or EU or countries with good regulation/oversight. For example a 2017 study in Pakistan found such high levels of heavy metals in local cosmetics that the researchers basically recommended that locals just stop wearing makeup at all if possible. Your cosmetics shouldn't pose a risk to you just because of where you happen to live.

**Will Barça signed Lautaro Martinez?**

“Barça have spoken to Inter about Lautaro over the last few weeks but the conversations have been put on hold by mutual consent. The current situation doesn't allow for major transfer fees.”

**Is signing Neymar still possible?**

“In the current situation, no. PSG don't want to sell either, which makes sense as he's one of the best players in the world. Last summer we tried really hard (to sign him) but this summer we won't even try. The club lost €200m between March and June. In the 2020/21 season, we expected to earn €1100m but that's likely to be 30% less now. If the situation doesn't improve, they won't be people in the stands, at the museum or the shops and we'll keep losing money. This will cause us to revise our spending plans and which ones can wait. We have to adapt.”

**Does this mean the multi-million euro transfers will stop for now?**

“I believe so. Or at least there will be more swap deals. All the big European clubs have been impacted by this and we are all working to adapt. This won't be for just one year, it could be for up to 3-4 years.”

**What will Pjanic bring to the side?**

“We've been following him for a while. But every time we moved for him it wasn't possible because his club didn't want to stay. He was always excited about the chance of coming to Barça. This isn't a surprise signing. He's going to be an important player for us.”

The US is the hardest-hit epicenter of the virus in the world right now. It didn’t have to be this way. It’s so bad that many countries have banned Americans from entering because Trump’s lack of a response to the virus has resulted in so many of us being infected that we are considered dangerous disease-carrying foreigners who should not be granted access to these countries. 

Ironically, Trump taken the virus seriously and took the appropriate action to stop it then he would probably be leading Biden by a ton today. 

But Trump downplayed the virus from the beginning. Then, when it was too much to ignore, he banned travel from China (while initially doing nothing about Europe, which has been shown to be a major source of the virus to the US.)

That was in January. Then he did nothing in February — except continue to make clearly untrue statements that painted an unrealistic picture about the virus’ danger.

Then, as the country closed down, he decided to sabotage efforts to stop the virus by calling on people to “liberate” states who had stay at home orders to prevent the virus’ spread.

Then he refused to allow the federal government lead a national testing and response strategy for the virus. Instead, he pushed the work onto governors and sought to blame them when the virus inevitably got worse because of the federal government’s lack of leadership.

Then he attacked governors who weren’t sufficiently complimentary of him and threatened that the federal government would only respond to and help the citizens of states whose governors had been nice enough to him. 

Then he mocked the idea of wearing a mask, refused to wear one himself and sent the message that anyone who does was simply cowardly virtue-signaling.

Then he promoted conspiracy theories about the virus and publicly spit balled about possibly infecting disinfectant to stop it.

TL;DR: 
BUY A TOYOTA COROLLA! 2000-2006, under 120xxk's, camchain, for 5k. Then enjoy your life 


Hey there, first of all, I think you've made the right choice to go secondhand! And 7k is plenty (heaps!) for what you're after.

My first piece of advice is: Avoid European, buy Japanese.
My second piece of advice is: Just buy a Toyota 😊
Well known for making incredibly reliable, economical engines and cheap to repair when it comes to buying parts.
Imho most (not all) toyotas are at the top of my list for a dependable vehicle, I've owned several and have been really happy with all of them.
If I was you I would look for:

Year 2000 or newer (so it's only once a year wof)

Km's: 
under 100xxxk's is really great!
under 150xxxk's is v good
under 200xxxk's is alright.
Anything above that, more parts need replacing (suspension, drivetrain etc) still fine if you love the car and are happy to pay for a few more things to service.

Cam-chain instead of cambelt (less maintenance)

4-door (I just think 2doors are annoying, you may disagree😎)

Evidence the owner has serviced it regularly (oil change every 10xxxk's, tyres, etc)
If the car has a VTNZ wof, it's a big plus for me also. 

Also I'd ask a few other questions about car use:
Will you be driving other people around much? 
Carrying stuff in the boot? 
Needing to park in city areas?
Wanting to go on longer (out of city) trips on the weekend?

These will all influence how big you want the body and engine of the car to be. 

Car choice is a very personal thing. Everybody has their own tastes etc 
Personally I prefer cars from around early 2000's. (simpler engines, less computerised fuel pumps etc) from my experience simpler = more reliable and cheaper to fix.
And I like smaller cars for more agile parking :)

Here are a few I found quickly on trademe. Well under your budget yet still hitting everything you require. 
All are in Auckland.

One is slightly smaller (vitz)
[https://www.trademe.co.nz/a/motors/cars/toyota/vitz/listing/2706252753](https://www.trademe.co.nz/a/motors/cars/toyota/vitz/listing/2706252753)

The other has a bit more room (corolla)
[https://www.trademe.co.nz/a/motors/cars/toyota/corolla/listing/2718827777](https://www.trademe.co.nz/a/motors/cars/toyota/corolla/listing/2718827777)

Lot of people love these also, I've heard good things (swift)
https://www.trademe.co.nz/a/motors/cars/suzuki/swift/search?price_max=7500&amp;year_min=2000&amp;auto_category_jump=false&amp;user_region=2&amp;listing_type=private&amp;sort_order=motorslowestkilometres


If you wanna be really sure about the car's condition, you can get a pre-purchase inspection done. At AA or other mechanics. 

There's a distinct and simple joy attached to looking at a new car. You meet the owner, have a chat, get to know them a bit, take it for a drive, see how it feels. Check the oil and water so you feel like a detective. 
Then you bargain over the price, hand over some cash and drive away merrily until you get the hankering for that joy again, at which point you repeat the whole process!
Good luck, for what you want 7k is heaps. Get something for 4-5k and spend the rest on bitcoin! Or a holiday? 

Oh and like my dad always says everytime I go home ""You checked the oil on that car recently?""
Once you do eventually buy one, check oil and water every two weeks or so. Change them every 10xxxk's and enjoy stress free motoring for years!!!

Feel free to dm me any ones you find on trademe and I'll tell you what I think. But if you follow the above, there's not much that can go wrong. 


Shit this is far too long!

*The lab studies, conducted in March 2020, demonstrated that Shycocan induced a 3.435 Log10 reduction in an EPA-approved phylogenetic surrogate, and reduced 99.9% S-protein infectivity.*

However the main  consensus is that people with adhd have on average smaller and has slower, lesser blood flow in the frontal lobes. This is the part where most of the executive functions are done. This is also the part where much of the happy hormones are coming from.  If there is less blood and thus les oxygen there will be less hormones.  Adhd is a rewarding system defect.  Most treatments are  focused on increasing the bloodflow in those regions. Amfetamines do a really good job of that. That's why every treatment also works for non adhd people, that's the reason students are addicted to the stuff. 

There are plenty of other options we could try such as non stimulants and or sports but none of those work as effective and efficient as the stimulants.

I like to make this analogy.  Imagine a highway where everyone is riding at the speed limit wich let's say is a 100 km/u(am European). Every one has roughly the same car with an capable engine in it.  Now Imagine that when you have adhd your engine is not as strong. While every one still drives 100 I drive 80 at max. We live in a community where that's dangerous so we go heckling and pushing or tailgating the ones that are driving dangerously.  Now Imagine I get a better fuel like kerosine  or nitrous to drive on. Suddenly I can drive at max 100.  And I don't drive dangerously or different any more, I can drive along everyone else. 

Sure kerosine or nitrous works for others to. But you exceed your intended capacity wich is even more dangerously. It gets addictive.  Thats the difference. Is a person in a wheelchair addicted to his wheelchair? No.  Can a non cripple be lazy and use a wheelchair to get around? Sure  but thats ethically wrong.

Every one does not pay attention to his or her fuel gage once in a while. But with adhd you don't even have a fuel gage. We  driving a rickety barebones chassis with an engine in it.

Its inherently a fallacy to think that adhd is not real because you experience some sympto to once in  a while.

Personally I rather die 5 years earlier of some heart failure due to the drugs than to live 70 another years unhappy and depressed due to a deficit in my rewarding system.

forget what STEM students have to say for one second; not everything needs a metric. your obsession for ""facts and logic"" makes you look absolutely pathetic. if YOU don't want to take your head out of the sand to respect the fact that people face discrimination for their ""metric-less"" culture then you need to mind your own business. at the point to which you can say there are ""good black people"" - a title you give them because they let you express blatant racism, your racist ""takes"" have NO credibility, have never HAD CREDIBILITY, and will NEVER have credibility. stop sealioning innocent Black people and POC into explaining their right to respect and explaining that they are people too.

on your second talking point about multiculturalism,  (not that you deserve the privilege of rational disagreement, but I'll see if really and truly you don't understand or if you want people to validate your racism), you said that at cultural festivals, you see POC sharing their culture with white people. in saying this, you already set out the point I'm going to make in this paragraph, but as I said before, you want everything laid out to you on a silver platter, in clear coherent sentences, because google is just *such a hassle* for you to use. these people who you are so desperate to use as the face of multiculturalism and as evidence that cultural appropriation isn't a problem, have ***invited*** non-POC to participate in their culture. maybe I'm just being a *sensitive snowflake* but if someone invited me to participate in their culture, I'd do so. but when you participate in someone else's culture **uninvited,** ***and removed*** **from the people to whom said culture** ***belongs,*** then you aren't sharing, you're commodifying it for an aesthetic. and if you actually did some research, *or searched the sub for 10 minutes,* before making a post to criticise POC for feeling defensive about something they're constantly persecuted for, then you would have saved yourself from looking like an absolute numpty on multiple counts.

hence and so forth, if you do not understand, after I, and several other users on this sub have spelled it out for you, very clearly, then you simply do not want to respect POC and it will be in everyone's best interests to not respond.

The flagship product of Arbistar 2.0 is a bot called PBP and it is an arbitrage bot for crypto. In this PBP (personal bot pro) your cryptos remain in your exchanges. The bot operates using API.

I interviewed in my podcast (unfortunately in the Italian Language) one customer of PBP. If you visit [merita.biz/229](https://merita.biz/229) you can find a copy of the webinar where he shows the bot operating in the exchanges (binace, coinbase, etc...).

The operation was real and we were live.

For the community bot, that is usually mentioned as a ""scam"", I don't think it is a scam. It was a ""marketing tool"" to have the money to develop the PBP. For the moment it seems it works fine. Arbistar recently announced the Community will not accept new membership starting from 31st DEC 2020. It seems the bot is going to be saturated soon and the company has new similar offers more secure for the customer with Legal tech contracts.

The community bot is based on a technology that was created by the company. It worked but at the moment of the deployment, Arbistar noted how was difficult to maintain updated all the virtual machines of the customers. So the pivot to Community Bot that is one single instance easier to manage and in the meantime they developed the PBP.

It is easy for the blogger said ""It's a scam"" to run some ads on their pages. But the reality is always more complex than expected. I'm not an Arbistar investor and It was interesting to have a look live to the bot.

Ep 8 went wrong on so many places that I just hoped they’d bring the ship home safely with Ep 9. oh boy was I wrong about that...

It’s a racist and classist concept. Human beings have the mental capacity to understand that killing other people isn’t good. Nor is stealing land, raping, or pillaging. They used propaganda to make it seem okay.

Just some points as I have to wrap this up fairly quick

1. The Soviet military was significantly less capable, and less functional than the Cold War made it out to be. Looking at some of the struggles with Afghanistan, it's clear there were a lot of organizational failings, supply and support issues.  There was a tendency in the Cold War to basically treat the Soviet military as 40 foot tall supermen that sort of combined the best of high tech with the mindless chittering unstoppable hoards the post-war narrative of the Eastern front portrayed the Soviet Army as.  
2. The Soviet military also had enough capable units, in large numbers, to the degree where whatever ""edge"" that NATO had in technology or training was not enough to realistically stop a full conventional Soviet commitment to invading Europe until really the 1980s

With that said:

1. The point of NATO wasn't to fight and win a war with the USSR.  It was to impose a realistic cost to Soviet aggression, and to fend off situations short of total Soviet commitment.  The concern was the Soviets would just occupy West Berlin, or take bites of Western Europe ala Hitler 1930's.  What NATO did was provide credible forces to make ""small bites"" impractical.  You weren't just going to surge a few Battalions somewhere and announce a ""border security area"" if you were the Soviets without getting beat on, which then forced you to commit to full scale WW3 level forces, which then triggered nuclear conflict. So to summarize, the point of NATO wasn't really to ""beat"" the Soviets, it was to make it too hard for the Soviets to confidently be able to accomplish anything militarily short of having to go to a full scale war that would go nuclear and end the world as we know it.
2. While the Soviets commanded a conventional advantage, it was ruinously expensive.  The kind of force advantage the Soviets needed to realistically invade Western Europe compared to the NATO was quite large, and while NATO was comprised of most of the world's strongest, largest economies, so could afford such madness as the US Army having complete Corps in Europe, or multiple cutting edge programs for equipment (see Challenger/Leo 2/M1/Leclerc, or the number of different airframes in NATO forces), the Soviets could not afford the kind of force superiority in the long term, and you eventually have this imbalance in which the military heavy spending/production eventually undercuts the military heavy spending/production because the civil infrastructure is neglected to the point where toilet paper and basic electronics are impossible production goals.  
3. The ""conventional war without nuclear weapons"" scenario for WW3 is fun, but it's a counter-factual.  The Soviets always planned on using tactical weapons as part of their attack, which would have triggered a NATO nuclear response.  It's a great wargame scenario and there's maybe some counter-factual alternate history scenarios that make sense too, but it's like talking about WW2 without airpower.

European (PAL) versions of movies may run 5% faster then cinematic/US-Video Releases, also resulting in a pitch up of about a semitone (not so much the case with modern HD releases). Especially with older recordings that have been transferred several times between audio tapes, film and other media, you can end up with bizarre tunings that are fractions of a semitone ""off"".

Sometimes the discrepancy in pitch seems to be just random, with no apparent reason. Maybe the person doing the notation thinks his version will be easier to play.

In the end, it may be more helpful to match the tonal range of your performers/singers than the original recording.

A lot of confederate statues were put up in the 1920s for three reasons: (1) the last of the civil war veterans were dying off, and in many cases these were a tribute to them and their fallen comrades; (2) the nation owed a debt to the huge sacrifice of WWI veterans, which was disproportionately southern (where most US army bases are located); and (3) the myth of the ""honorable soldier"" was part of Jim Crow ""lost cause"" propaganda -- i.e. that there was honor in being a solider who sacrificed for his homestead regardless of the cause. The last of these reasons is the most despicable, but it also means that these monuments are living proof of the Jim Crow, white supremacy mentality. It's worth considering that removing them effectively erases the history of Jim Crow, which I think isn't necessarily desirable.  I favor leaving some memorials to fallen soldiers so long as the statue is not of a glorified leader like Robert E Lee, but is merely a memory of those who died. 
 
Russia also had a problem with statuary -- tons of communist statues of Stalin and Lenin, guys who killed tens of millions of people directly and indirectly. The Russian answer was to destroy many of them, but also move a big collection to a park in Moscow that now serves as a cemetery or museum to the communist horror. I would favor doing something similar in the Deep South so as to avoid the issue of whitewashing history: move them to a park or museum of Jim Crow to remind us of a shameful period in history.
 
But the point being, these issues are complicated and need careful thought -- which is not what you get with a mob. Mobs have defaced or destroyed statues of Churchill, Gandhi, Teddy Roosevelt, Lincoln, Columbus, etc. In LA, the statue of Raoul Wallenberg (the Swedish diplomat who saved thousands of Hungarian Jews from the Nazis) was covered with anti-Semitic slogans. Even a memorial to the 54th Regiment (of African Americans who fought in the Civil War) was vandalized.  None of this destruction is virtuous, and all are committed by people with an extremely weak understanding of history in context. 
 
Lastly, even if you abhor a particular event in history, is it really productive to erase it? The Arc de Triomphe in Paris was built by the Hitler of his day -- Napoleon -- who terrorized Europe, invading almost every country -- but aren't we glad it's there nonetheless? What horrors did the Aztec kings commit on their captured slaves as they tore their hearts out, yet surely we appreciate that theses great temples in Mexico are there for us to see?  The Colosseum in Rome was where slaves and Christians were fed to lions, or torn to pieces by gladiators. Unspeakable horror. Yet millions of tourists who visit Rome can reflect on both the greatness and madness of that civilization. Why haven't Christians torn down the Colosseum?

They are indeed the same mask.  They are not differently constructed.  I have been to Chinese factories over 30 times in the last 11 years and watched the manufacturing process myself.  The ""cup"" shape you're referring to is simply the way masks are made by process, by country.  The US, the EU and Asia all have cup shaped and cone shaped respiratory media depending on the application.  

Then you have a strange sentence: ""If you’re in the US and required to wear an N95, pre-COVID a non-NIOSH accepted KN95 was not a suitable substitute and is currently only allowed under emergency protocols.""

Okay maybe what you're trying to say is that pre-Covid, KN95s were not approved for use in the USA.  All KN95s are non-NIOSH by definition so I don't know what that means.  The reason for that is because we have our own regulatory testing body called NIOSH.  NIOSH tests all kinds of different products from shoes to cut-resistant gloves to, in this case, masks, to certify that they do what they claim to do.  Once NIOSH certifies an item, the FDA then approves it for sale in the US.  The part you don't know is that all this respiratory media is the exact same.  Most factories that manufacture masks (I've been to China dozens of times in these very factories) hold certifications from Australia, Asia, Africa, the US and the EU.  Quite literally masks are made in gigantic lots that are stamped, imprinted and/or marked with the specific region certifications, boxed and shipped.  Then the next week they do the same process for a different region.  

Lastly, discovering a counterfeit is incredibly easy.  A true KN95 respirator must have the GB2626 standard imprinted on the mask.

I wandered around youtube when I was more  foolish and the amount of Germans outright claiming they were pushed to  war and blaming others was tremendous. I do not cement my views out of  those places and I advice you to not take reddit as serious as well. 

I actually would agree to you if it was not the Polish government itself reinforcing such views, just recently confirmed by the majority of Poles. 

I am aware of the bubbles you percieve on reddit and the internet in general, but there is much more to it currently then just your usual right wing fringe groups. 

You are very much right of such people existing here in Germany, but they lack in numbers and power to define politics to the same degree as in Poland. At the same time Poles in their attitudes (and I am aware I am heavily generalizing here) massivly reinforce exactly the kind of people you talk about here. 

&gt; Now excluding our current, braindead government which is in power only  for 5 years, last 30 years were the time when Polish-German relations  were at best in 1000 years of common history. 

That EXACTLY is the thing I can't get my head wrapped around. Not just in regards to German Polish relations, but the Polish position in general. Argueably never in it's history has Poland done so well, both in security, european influence and economic matters. Yet you'd think we are right between the wars in their agression.

&gt; You cannot threw that away to the bin, just because some trolls did hurt your feelings. 

It is not me throwing it away. I am reacting to people who are throwing it away. And there comes a point where trying to understand the historic perspective and psychological conditions of another country as a whole just requires so much energy to stay calm and relaxed that it's becoming hard to manage. 

&gt;  According to common studies 56% of Poles look sympathetic toward  Germans. Meanwhile 29% Germans says the same about Poles. So there's  that and it was exactly the same, even before PiS got to power. 

And yet these people vote in a party that rallies it's base with anti german messages (amongst others) for cheap election points. And obviously that does not alienate people enough to give their votes to others. So in the end, Poles do not really care, do they? I am willing to be convinced otherwise, but so far I do not see the pro German attitues you talk about playing any kind of role. 

&gt; No but Russian Red Army was. Among with many Poles, nothing to be proud of and we know that, believe me. 

Ok, in dubio pro reo, but I would need sources for that because to my knowledge, the enactment of said Yalte agreements was squarely in Polish hands. 

&gt; I don't want to go that river. You have means to check for yourself,  that a 1000 years is vastly exaggerated. Cities that we have today were  located 1000 years ago by Poles like my own Opole or Wrocław and  Szczecin was raised by Sorbs. Opole and Wrocław went under German  control in 1526 (Habsburgs) and Szczecin went Hanza in XIV century. 

Mate, a simple map of the HRE of around 1200 tells you anything you need to know. I am not talking about regions like East Prussia. And all of that can be offset by arguments of feudal laws and how ethnicity was seen back then, that these areas before the migration period never saw slavic populations to begin with and so on and so on. It would indeed lead nowhere. 

But, fact is, these areas in 1945 were as German as they could be. And losing them was not just a matter of ""Return to Poland"". It was a big deal. And it was an even bigger deal to actually recognize this. That this is so casually waved away in a lot of Polish conversations AND in politics (remember PIS making reperations a topic just recently?), that is the whole point here. 

&gt; Look, Poland really look at postwar relations with Germany with  optimism. We know you advocated for us in many cases and all of this is  possible BECAUSE we know you're open about your own history (unlike  Russia). To keep it that way, maybe let your Embassy say few nice words  in painful anniversaries like that one. 

I appreciate that, it is not something you hear often. And to be frank, I personally looked very much forward to see a country progress which I actually respected and still respect for their resilience and surviveability. Poland easily had the pontential to become the third big player next to France and Germany within the EU, but they blow it and I do not get why. 

But there also is this lingering feeling that people actually want to take advantage of Germany's opennes towards the past and want to milk these sentiments for their own advancement, not because they actually really care.

Of course, no proper Tory shall complain about this incident, it's just good journalism! /s

Let's not forget:

1. Deliberate attempts to edit out the laughter during Boris Johnson's Question Time Leader's Debate on the BBC (must've hurt his fragile ego).
2. Attempts to inflate antisemitism in the Labour Party from around 0.06% to 0.6% when reporting it. It is an order of magnitude (that's TEN times) lower than it was said to be.
3. Taking a fake tweet from a fake Tom Watson account regarding scrapping the post of Deputy Leader in a report.
4. Misrepresenting the views of Richard Burgon MP, and two other MPs, in regards to Brexit. Christian Fraser used their own views from interviews and misrepresented those views as the views of the entire Party.
5. Misquoting the criticisms levelled at the Green New Deal in Corbyn's manifesto, attempting to make Labour seem dishonest.
6. The BBC attempted to claim a union official was going to be readmitted to the Party when they'd never left. The official's name was Sian Bloor.
7. When Diane Abbott stated that Labour was ""kind of level-pegging"" with the Conservatives in the polls on Question Time, Fiona Bruce retorted that they were 'definitely' behind. After checking the YouGov poll, Abbott was correct with her statement, whilst Bruce was incorrect in describing the situation as 'definitely' against Labour. Perhaps a lousy attempt to make her look bad with numbers, BBC?
8. Victoria Derbyshire criticised Labour's 'Race and Faith' manifesto by stating (incorrectly) that there was no mention of Muslims and Islamophobia. There was. Since one of Labour's largest voting bases can be found with the Muslim community, many of whom hold the same interests as ordinary people, one can clearly see this as an attempt to dissuade Muslim voters from going towards voting Labour.
9. A disproportionate amount of airtime of antisemitism in the Labour Party. The airtime of antisemitism in the Labour Party was also disproportionate to a lot of the airtime placed upon other forms of prejudice in not just political parties but in the United Kingdom generally.
10. In regards to antisemitism in UK Politics, the BBC deliberately avoid mentioning Boris Johnson's book ""Seventy-Two Virgins"", where he depicts Jewish people as controlling the entire media, alongside depicting their appearances with caricatures of hooked noses and slanty eyes.
11. Describing the nationalisation of broadband as 'Broadband Communism' in the BBC. It would've been useful now, especially for lower-income families that are cash-strapped, just to point it out.
12. Laura Kuenssberg failed to do her job properly (not to mention, with impartiality) after she describes Jeremy Hunt's 'commitment' to the NHS as 'unquestionable'. Question him, for heaven's sake, it's what you're supposed to do!
13. Don't enjoy attacking people here, since as long as their good journalists/correspondents who are honest and impartial for a BBC that all sorts of people from all sides of the political spectrum are watching - there are many high profile, ideologically right-wing staff members on the BBC. A notable absence of any left-wing names is also apparent.
14. In June 2019, more than half of all guests who appeared on BBC Politics flagship political shows were Tories. The exact percentages are 50.17% Conservative, 14.03% Labour Party, 2.85% Liberal Democrats, 2.46% Brexit Party, and 1.75% SNP. Clearly the Labour Party should've had more representation, and in order to remain fair to others as well, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats should've had more people on too.
15. Reported hate crimes have doubled since 2013, to over 100000 from 2018/2019. 76% of these crimes were race-related, 14'491 cases due to sexual orientation, 8'256 against disabled people, 3'530 Islamophobic cases, and 1326 antisemitic cases. Yet again, the coverage of these incidents was disproportionately done in regards to antisemitism with a deliberate attempt to link them to the Labour Party.
16. Laura Kuenssberg was told to report - by two 'undisclosed' Tory Sources - a fake story. She uncritically stated that one of Matt Hancock's assistants had been punched in the face by a Labour supporter.
17. The BBC had more of a field day with the false fact that Corbyn had failed to deal with 'alleged' antisemitism in Labour, as opposed to Boris Johnson hiding in the fridge after seeing a photo of a sick child left on a hospital floor.
18. This event occurred two days before the election. Not a few months, not a few weeks, a few days. The first five minutes of a BBC News programme aired a UK Labour MP secretly saying on the phone that Labour can't win. One can see how this would unnerve the tenacity of Labour supporters.
19. A video of Sir Keir Starmer on Good Morning Britain was doctored to seem as if he didn't even understand Labour's simplest policies. It was done by none other than the Conservative Party.
20. A Tory supporter by the name of Ryan Jacobsz accused Corbyn of being an antisemite on the BBC show Question Time during Corbyn's Leader's Debate. Although the BBC claim that they are being impartial with their audience choices, he has been on the show FOUR times, and 3 times in the last 4 years. I was surprised to find out that there was no rule on not applying more than once every 5 or 10 years, for example.
21. Emma Barnett, another BBC Journalist, asked Angela Rayner during a BBC Question Time election special whether the United Kingdom would 'nationalise sausages' if they won the election. \*cue in EuroSausage video from Yes Minister\*
22. Freudian slip: Alex Forsyth (BBC Political Correspondent) stated that ""They \[The Tories\] have done a relentless focus on Boris Johnson's promise to take the UK out of the EU if he wins the majority ***that he so deserves***.""

Sir Michael Lyons blames 'political pressure' upon the BBC to do what they did, in the previous TWENTY-TWO incidents of failed journalism I have mentioned here.

You're only taking individual income taxes into account, and not considering a wide variety of other taxes that we pay. Also, your number does not include the 7.65% FICA payroll tax which, in your example, would bring up the effective rate considerably. In addition, your employer is paying another 7.65% on top of that. Most economists consider that employer portion to be effectively a hidden portion of one's salary, so if you add all those to your 3.7% effective rate example, you're actually looking at up to 19%, essentially. 

In addition, of course, you have sales taxes, property taxes, corporate income taxes, various other state and local taxes, that collectively generate a great deal of revenue.

That said, however, you are right in one sense, which is that I believe the 35% number in the meme is actually referring to US government *spending*, not US government tax revenues. In reality, because we consistently run deficits of at least several percentage points of GDP, we have only been collecting tax revenues of around 23 - 28% in recent years. It is important to note however, that if you consider private health insurance costs as a tax (which they effectively are, for most Americans), it appears that the US is basically paying close to European levels of taxation, but without many of the benefits that Europeans typically get in return for those taxes.

EU vs LPL at 2018 worlds was 9-11 in favour of LPL from memory. Without IG it was 7-4 for EU. Pretty substantial difference, in a similar way to how EU vs KR changed last year without G2 (IG brought LPL to 55% wr vs EU from 36%, G2 brought EU to 53% wr vs KR from 33%).

&gt;The EU is committed to maintaining a legal order for the seas and oceans based upon the principles of international law, as reflected notably in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). This includes the maintenance of maritime safety, security, and cooperation, freedom of navigation and overflight.

&gt;While not taking a position on claims to land territory and maritime space in the South China Sea, the EU urges all claimants to resolve disputes through peaceful means, to clarify the basis of their claims, and to pursue them in accordance with international law including UNCLOS and its arbitration procedures.

&gt;The EU is concerned about the deployment of missiles on islands in the South China Sea. The temporary or permanent deployment of military forces or equipment on disputed maritime features which affects regional security and may threaten freedom of navigation and overflight is a major concern. The EU therefore calls on all claimants to refrain from militarisation in the region, from the use or threat of force, and to abstain from unilateral actions.

&gt;The EU encourages further engagement in confidence building measures which seek to build trust and security in the region. The EU fully supports regional ASEAN-led processes and is looking forward to a swift conclusion of the talks on a 'Code of Conduct' which will further support a rules-based regional and international order. In this connection, the EU reiterates its offer to share best practices on maritime security.

I sincerely, feel an immense gratitude for mostly everything that the Spanish Empire did in the Americas.

Most of the hate that comes to Spain becomes from ""the black legend"" a very negative narrative against Spain that was pushed by its enemies, mostly Great Britain and France. Things that are part of the black legend are, a supposed genocide against the natives, Spain accumulating most of the resources from the Americas to Europe and other events that are easily refutable. 

I personally agree with the thesis from philosopher Gustavo Bueno which says that Spain was a ""generating Empire"" (Imperio generador) as opposed to the ""depredating empires"" (imperios depredadores) like Britain, France, and so on. Spain founded universities, brought an immense amount of knowledge, unified our civilizations in one political community, and elevated the Empire to the greatest world power during the golden century. I sincerely prefer 100 times to be ""colonized"" by Spain rather than the British, French, and other depredating empires, and I even feel proud of our Hispanic heritage.

Sadly, just a few minority in LatAm share my point of view, since the black legend and the hate to Spain was one of the principles needed to fragment the Empire. 

I recommend reading the books ""Imperiofobia y leyenda negra"" from Maria Elvira Roca Barea, and ""España frente a Europa"" from Gustavo Bueno. Both books go deeper into this point of view, but sadly, neither of them have been translated into English :/

Puer has a (somewhat undeserved) reputation for being very expensive. Puer tea varies widely from sample to sample, even the same batch from a single manufacturer, due to differences in storage.

All in all it's a big deep rabbit hole.

That being said, you might try some samples of ripe (aka cooked or shou or shu or black) puer (as opposed to raw or sheng or green puer). Be sure to buy it from a puer specialist and not a general tea vendor. Somebody already invoked Automod... look at what it said, with particular attention to the vendor list. Four of the top 6 entries are Pu specialists.

Shu puer can be made in a European style pot or with a mug infuser with long steep/low leaf ratio brewing, much as you'd make English Breakfast, with good results.

So any AOSP fork will still be primarily developed and owned by Google, but it is still a good sign regardless.

I think the ruling doesn't have a huge effect on antitrust outside of the huge fine itself, since most phone manufacturers will choose to lay the proprietary google services on top of Android anyways -- Manufacturers just want the phones to work as well as possible without spending time and money developing their own android fork, as they don't have a vested interest in user privacy.

* The Spartan III's being equipped with MJOLNIR rather than SPI armour.
* The Spartan III's in Noble Team all being *way* older than the prescribed age for orphans to ""volunteer"" for the Spartan III-program.
* Cortana originally collects the information to decipher the location of Installation 04 from charts on Sigma Octanus IV. In the game, she apparently discovers it from the Forerunner ship under the Babd Catha ice flow.
* The Fall of Reach in the book takes a day, in the game it lasts a month.
* In the book, Halsey says that all of the remaining Spartans are present on the Pillar of Autumn, while there is a Red Team of Spartans fighting on the surface.
* The Pillar of Autumn's location is a whole mess, in the books, it is fighting in space, drops off Master Chief at Gamma Station, covers him, then come and picks him up, before heading into Slipspace. At no point does it land on Reach.
* Halsey is completely unaware of the Spartan III program until she arrives at Onyx - yet she meets Noble Team and thinks nothing of it.
* In the Fall of Reach, it says that Master Chief first encounters Elites at Gamma Station during the Fall of Reach, though later editions of the book changed this statement, and I'm happy they did. Because never encountering the main warrior caste of the Covenant for 25 years of war is ridiculous.

Because you don't have reliable data on what's ""better"". The data you compare it to is flawed. It's like saying I'm taller than you even if I don't really know how tall you are. All countries test differently with different data broken down to regions on amount of tests reported. The data for this is just not good and reliable. So they use the single best metric that is the least flawed (it's still flawed!) 
Postive tests per 100k cumulative over 7 days. It's not good, but it's the best thing that can be used to get outbreak regions on the radar.

&gt; The number of new coronavirus infections in Sweden has dropped by 54% since late June, the World Health Organisation said Wednesday.

&gt; According to the WHO report, over the last month, Spain, France, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands have seen increases between 40% and 200%. Last month, Sweden was the second most-infected country per capita in the world, but its daily new cases have been decreasing since June 24, when it reported 1,803 new infections.

&gt; The daily number of deaths in Sweden has been decreasing since mid-April, when it reported a record death count of 115.

Had you ever been involved with a maintenance of a contemporary housing, built some 10-20 years before? Because I was, and I also was involved in renovation of centuries-old structures, and per capita the cost of the latter was lower.

&gt;Cities of the past were prone to fires, disease ridden and congested. Buildings had terrible heating/ventillation and were overcrowded. Almost nobody owned a house.

Very silly generalization. The city of the 12-18th century was dense, but the general population was much lower, thus the houses that in 19th century multiple families were crammed into were built to house a single family. Much more like the the massive industrialization of 19th century created a movement of people that the industry was not ready for, and yet by the early 20th centuries the construction industry was able to create large new districts strictly for the factory workers such as [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Wuppertal_Katernberger_Str_0004.jpg) or [this](https://www.globalphotos.org/paris/20050416/DSCN7730.jpg). And when pre-Industrial buildings were renovated for modern amenities and apartments they became (surprise! surprise!) extremely viable to live.

&gt; Out of the hundreds of years that cities were like this, only the most beautiful buildings, owned by the richest people (kind of) survived. The ugly buildings of the past (used by poor people) did not. 

Which is entirely false if you had set a foot in any European city, which I believe you did since you are Dutch - that makes you not stupid, but consciously disingenuous. There are a massive amount of coherent period urban ensembles, which is not surprising - the buildings were built by the same local craftsmen with the same amount of skill and the same materials available, the difference being the size and additional ornaments\decor.

&gt;Yes, modernist buildings often look bad. But they were also a giant step forward for almost all of the population.

Or so one ought to believe. But alas, less than a century has passed and these buildings are already obsolete, while the renovated pre-modernist apartments continue to live.

&gt;The comments are talking about as if there is/was a cabal of modernists amongst city planners, architects and developers that wants to destroy ""tradition"".

He gets hungry and reaches for his iphone to order breakfast from McDonalds using uber eats. “Stupid Americans making me eat their shitty food,” he thinks to himself, “European food is so much better not even close.” He has eaten KFC 3 out of the last 5 nights for dinner. He waits downstairs for his food so he decides to put on some American rap music. “Ugh stupid Americans,” he says “their culture is such shit! Not like European culture, we have history! and long-standing traditions. True culture comes from the wealthy!” A Muslim family crosses his path and he pretends to not be afraid and gives them a friendly nod and a wave. “WAAAOOOO” he thinks as he smirks so self-satisfied “I bet if this was America they would have shot them lol.” “Us Europeans are much more open-minded and civilized.” He nods agreeing with himself. His food arrives and makes his way back upstairs as he slurps down the coke Americans have forced him to drink. As he sits down to enjoy his shitty American food his Iphone receives an alert.

He jumps on Reddit and comments with furor and xenophobia. He never really congratulates New Zealand or their success but instead talks about how Americans will all die from COVID and how they are all so stupid. The European posts charts and graphs he has archived to link when he is questioned. Hes totally not obsessed with America. Dont even joke around like that. Hes cooming with joy. “I really showed those stupid Americans today” he says to himself “they fucking deserve it, god damn imperialists,” he says without a shred of irony. Felling extra good about his exploits he decides to go out and enjoy his blessed, virtuous, pretentious Euroday. He laces up his Jordans nice and tight. He puts on his favorite Batman shirt and Nike sweater. As he walks out he grabs a piece of cardboard sitting by the door. The European is now on his way out to protest about something happening in the U.S. Standing in a bus with 300 other people in it he has a thought.

As an analyst who works with data to tell a story, I feel your graph has to much noise.If you want to push the idea that the US tests more and therefore has more cases I would do something like this:

Take the total number of cases that each country has, not just dead but all (active, recovered and dead.) There may be duplicates but i feel that margin will be rather low.

Compare those values to the overall total population size, to get a cases per 1000 people.Overlap those results with a 2nd comparison of the number of tests per 1000 people.Looking at % may be more indicative here.

If USA is high on both, with Europe low on both, then your theory has something.If USA is high on both, with Europe low on cases but high on tests then your argument fails. Goodluck hope i've helped a little.

&gt; Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier was the first to postulate a warming of the atmosphere by CO2 in 1827. Many years later, Hoimar von Ditfurth, Volker Quaschningand Albert Arnold ""Al"" Gore believed that they had experimentally proven the Fourier thesis since they observed considerable air warming in various CO2 experiments. A careful review of their experiments now shows thatthe public is being manipulated and deceived here.The temperature increases are not caused by the CO2 greenhouse effect, but by the decrease in heat conduction. Particularly strong effects are obtained when CO2 is injectedas a “gas lake” under an air layer.However, if, as in the atmosphere, air and CO2 are mixed evenly, there is no warming and, in special circumstances, even a slight cooling can occur.

For example, you bring up the App Store and how much Apple siphons from it. But if I go to the grocery store and buy a soup from the shelf, I don’t think about the slotting fees that the manufacturer paid to the store for that shelf spot. (And yes, these anticompetitive grocery fees exist in European stores as well.) So while I don’t want to cover up the fact that these commissions might be problematic, I do find it odd that people only get fired up about a tech company doing something like this but don’t see how commerce is set up in other industries. 
  
As far as expensive accessories, I use Anker cables and accept that stuff like the iMac stand isn’t intended for the consumer market (it was released for their commercial product). And I think they make good faith attempts to keep the accessories backwards-compatible. The first phones released without a headphone jack came with a lightning dongle to convert wired headphones. And when they changed the Apple Watch sizes, they made them compatible with the older bands. Yes they have some expensive overpriced accessories, but it’s not really necessary to use their hardware, it’s just extra. 
  
The battery issue was legit, but the fact that they publicly apologized and provided cheap battery replacements to affected phones is about the same as what companies in other industries do for similar errors (like car manufacturers). Again, we don’t seem to apply the same scrutiny and grudges to other industries/companies, only Apple. Anyone using any phone is going to have to live with battery issues until alternative technology improves. 
  
And finally, the point about not needing to buy a new iPhone is exactly why Apple isn’t engaging in planned obsolescence. I had an iPhone 6S for 4 years (until last Christmas when my cousin was changing phones and gave me her iPhone 8 Plus). My 6S received all the latest software and security updates as the new phones, worked like brand new after I got my battery replacement, and I never felt pressure from the user experience to upgrade it. It’s rare for companies to continue releasing updates for hardware that’s 5 years old, even in other industries. Planned obsolescence would be if my phone broke immediately after the warranty expired. Plus Apple is investing in advanced recycling so that the components are not wasted and thrown away at the end of their life cycles.

So as I’m sure you are aware; we aren’t a race. We’re barely an ethnic group but more of a linguistic group.

The Colombian side is mestizo. Hence, your brown relatives. 

So like others have said. You are what you are. If you want to emphasize your non white ancestry then you can identify as POC. If not, you can say you’re mixed (Indigenous and white) which is true. 

To be honest, the American classification and designation of race is kinda silly. Many label any person with Latin American origins as “people of color” even if you’re white. I’ve seen white Brazilians being called POC because to the average American, they’re seen as “exotic”. So I wouldn’t put that much stock in people’s opinion.

Secondly - Diablo 3 is already a free 2 play game in China so Diablo Immortal will probably BE pay2win game on their market. That's no brainer since Asian market operates VERY differently than European/American.

Per your question: Nope, he dumped me. I had to block him from everything because, like you said, it's just too painful seeing any updates.

Mine was a LDR too, he broke up with me in April so I totally get what you're going through.

Nowhere did I say that we should reject ""allyship"" (whatever that term means) or that we should reject social justice issues. I'm saying that for Asian Americans, our allyship and social justice issues should be oriented around New America, rather than around the ""Old America"" white-black axis. When I lived in the Bay Area, my neighbors were East / SE Asian, but also Indian, Brazilian, Russian, Iranian, Mexican, etc. I became friends with many of the people around me who were of different races - went to parties with them, dated them, talked about politics and social justice and our issues as immigrants with them.  But none of them were white American or black American - I was building allyship outside of the limiting white-black social justice axis and instead was building it along the ""New America"" axis.

You claim that Middle Easterners and South Asians are highly involved with social justice issues - and I'm sure you can find a few examples of groups of Middle Easterners and South Asians who are active in social justice. I can find examples of East and Southeast Asians active as such also. But those examples doesn't change the fact that if you were to walk around Sunnyvale, California and talk to a random Indian person there, or around Westwood in LA and talk to a random Persian person, they wouldn't care that much about America's black-white social justice issues.
 I'm saying this as someone who has many Indian immigrant friends in Sunnyvale and Iranian immigrant friends in Westwood - their attitudes are actually pretty damn similar to those of East / Southeast Asian immigrants.

Your entire axis is oriented around an ""old America"" social justice / privilege discourse. If we take a long term view, this discourse will become increasingly irrelevant as ""old America"" simply self combusts. If you look at any news coming from America these days, it's all insanely high CovId infection rate, protests and strife, economic inequality and poverty and drug addiction and an endless cycle of self destruction. I believe ""old America"" simply cannot sustain itself and is going through it's death throes at the moment. The current state of political polarization and social justice movements and reactionary alt-right bullshit are all just the last gasps of a dying culture fundamentally built on hate and racism - it's people who have lost all hope for a better future grasping desperately at some semblance of meaning, whether through ""social justice"" or through reactionary racist BS. As someone who never cared for ""old America"" and experienced plenty of its racism, I say let it all burn. Let Old America enjoy it's meaningless political sideshows and emotional masturbation protests while the reality of economic collapse and social chaos tear it all apart.

The embers of old America's destruction can become the rich soil from which new America can spring up and take root. Old America's values, rooted as they are in racism, have always contained the seeds of their own self destruction. New America, whether Asian, Middle Eastern, Latin, or Eastern European, are rooted in hard work and family and love - a much better and sustainable set of values.As Old America self destructs, their relevance economically and culturally will wane - leaving theatrical political sideshows as their only remaining avenue of power. Of course, without economic power, those political sideshows will be just that, sideshows, meaningless fights over nothing.

Meanwhile, new America will continue generating wealth in places like California, and very possibly shepherding that wealth away from America to greener pastures. How the various ethnic groups of New America collectively manages their political balance of power and maintains their ability to extract wealth from America seems like a much more salient topic to me than the social justice theatrics of old America. That's the allyship that interests me.

You make a good point about Asians who are ""stuck"" in Old America. As an Asian who personally spent a good chunk of my formative years in Old America, few people understand the pain of that experience as well as I do. It's part of the reason I can't help feeling somewhat gleeful at seeing the self destruction of Old America. But I'm also aware that as Old America burns, their anger could be directed at the Asians in their community. I believe the best thing the Asians of New America can do for the Asians of Old America is to help them move and resettle in New America. I have personally contributed in this area by helping many Asians throughout the mid-west and south get jobs in California, via various Asian professional groups and fraternity networks. 

I can see how the perspective of an Asian Australian might be very different. ""Old Australia"" may have its problems, but it isn't nearly on the cusp of complete immolation the way ""Old America"" is. In addition, the number of immigrants constituting ""New Australia"" isn't anywhere close to reaching the sort of critical mass that ""New America"" has. It makes sense then that a different strategy would apply to Australia.

&gt; 
&gt; Your own interests conflict with their own. This has created a system in which insurance companies spend large sums of money trying to avoid covering people that might need care, or avoid payng out claims in general.

The problem with this view is that you're arguing roughly the same thing as I am. If there was a competitive market, an insurer that did care about their customers would capture a lot more market share. It's clear, from the above that they don't have to do that, ergo you don't have a competitive market.

In the EU, the market is competitive, and that drives insurers towards caring for their customers. I'm happy with mine at the moment, given that I pay my taxes as usual, but get a 50 euro/year refund for my sports club membership (along with some additional coverage above the bare minimum). If my insurer would stop that, I can just switch to another one who just provides more coverage instead.

&gt;For example, hospitals in the US often have more administrative personnel than hospital beds. This is because hospitals have to navigate a massive tangled mess of insurance contracts, fight to get paid, and deal with insurance companies trying to deny claims.

I don't disagree that the US system sucks. I just want to point out that turning it into the NHS instead would be only a marginally better solution, while there are WAY better solutions, based on competition, available.

&gt;Banned refusing coverage for pre-existing conditions or future health needs.

In my own country it works differently. Basically pre-existing conditions are not an issue, since health insurance is mandatory from birth to death. If you switch insurer, but have a pre-existing condition, the previous insurer has to pay up for a while instead. This deals with the risk. 

&gt;Capped insurance payments to doctors/hospitals to control the costs.

Doctors work on a fixed fee per consult in my own country. The deal, struck at the time, was that the government would guarantee their work by only allowing a fixed number of doctors to graduate each year. Switzerland is similar, the Netherlands AFAIK doesn't have that (and thus doctors are paid better, but their healthcare is more expensive in return).

&gt;capped premiums and subsidized them to make insurance affordable.

This is what I meant with the government setting the rules. Basically most european countries pay for healthcare through taxation (so it's subsidized for those with low income) but distribute these taxes among all the insurers according to their share of the population they insure. It's a very good system, because it in essence guarantees quality through competition without leaving the weakest behind.",True,False,False,,,,0,1596399121,,False,0,{},g04yok3,False,t3_i17o94,False,True,t1_g04xh88,/r/Libertarian/comments/i17o94/kushner_covid19_plan_axed_because_virus_hit/g04yok3/,False,,1609139514,1,True,False,Libertarian,t5_2qh63,r/Libertarian,public,,0,[],

This distinction is baked into the very names of the parties: the *Democrats* wants as close a tie between public will and policy as possible, while the *Republicans* want a more moderated system, a democratic republic, or democracy with the breaks on if you prefer. One of the former US parties were the Federalists, who essentially wanted the US to be a loose confederation more like the EU. Obviously a lot has changed in the centuries since these names were chosen, but you'll find that a lot of policy can be traced back to these fundamental concepts. 

So the question isn't so much what's more fair as what kind of system you want to live in. Is a Monarchy less fair than a democracy? Of course it is, but no monarchist would ever say that fairness was the goal of a monarchy - it would be effectiveness or martial prowess or something.

1. Trade and Production. As an industrial powerful country like Germany you are going to build some expensive units, like tanks and planes. You will need to trade some ressources for that. In peacetime that's not a problem, but due to the allies control most of rubber and oil, you will have a problem if you are not prepared. So build refineries to keep your rubber and oil supply floating.
As a smaller country you can't afford to trade in 
too many civil factories for resources, so you have to work with what you got, so you mostly build less good equipped units.
Its a balance between manpower and industrial capacity which you will get used to.
2. Armys, templates and frontlines.
You are usually playing with 4 kinds of divisions. Infantry, armoured, some light units for garnisions and regions with bad infrastructure (keep in mind, heavier units require more supply) and special units. Try to build you division templates with combat wides of 10, 20 or 40. To keep things simple, you really don't to have such a diversity in your army, i don't like micromanagement, so I often play Infantry templates only. As Germany you start with a decent infantry template, add 1 inf unit to make it a 20 combat wide and you are fine. 
Next step is to train armys. You are going to assign generals to them and they only allow 24 units in one army. On field Marshall can manage 5 generals. This means you are going to build packages of 24 inf divisions and assign them to a field Marshall.
It depends on your manpower and your equipment stockpile, how many units you can deploy. In your logistics window you can so how much you need and how long it takes to produce that.
I like to start ww2 as Germany with one full army ground (5x 24 divisions) and 12 Armoured templates.
Before the war you need to exercise your units. Press shift and click on the exercise symbol to exercise them until they are fully ready. Then move your armies to your future enemies by making frontlines. Eg. 2 full trained armies are enough for the west front of Poland. You then draw attack orders, give your troops a little time to prepare them and when everyone is position, declare war and execute all orders. If you have done everything Allright, you should see your troops steamrolling Europe.

And don't be afraid of the complexity of hoi4, its much simpler than it looks. When you understand the most mechanics and all the buttons, you will see there's not so much micromanage than it seems.

I heard different opinions on which nations are good for beginners. Germany is always a good choice, others say its the USA, where nobody can really harm you, but i like to recommend nations with early wars. Like Japan for example.
Its a great source of frustration, if you build up your armies for 3 years and than loose all wars, because you didn't understood basic mechanics of fighting.

Just because I'm offended by your opinion doesn't mean it has no value. Maybe it has little value to me, but I understand that this is a film - a work of art - and is not objective. If that's your opinion, that's fine, because it's *your opinion*, and everyone's opinions have value and should be considered. I learned to love this film because I began to ask if I agreed with people like you who dislike it. Slowly I learned that no, I don't agree with you, and I don't believe that there's enough evidence to support your claims such as ""Luke's arc isn't consistent.""

So do you want me to explain myself? Okay, I will. I have fully expect you not to read it, and I doubt we'll have anything else to talk about. I've considered and studied these points carefully for years, and I'm entrenched in my view because of evidence that clearly supports my opinion. Have any further discussion would probably waste both of our time, but here it is.

&gt; If you’ve studied this film for years and this is the conclusion you’ve arrived at, I would suggest watching it again, and this time play attention to it and seperate your emotions from the facts.

This is me paying attention and looking at the facts:

Luke's arc is not sloppy writing, and I'm going to try to give a *small* bit of my reasoning.

I don't take issue with the fact that you didn't like how he was interpreted. If you didn't like it, you didn't like it. That's all there is to it, and it's your personal opinion. Personally, I strongly disliked about 95% of the EU - the Thrawn stuff is pretty cool, but Luke is.. uhh.. not handled very well.

If you're getting stuck on the fact that Luke ignites his lightsaber in front of Kylo and then ""isn't bothered to try and fix his mistake"", you're fucked; as in - no amount of people explaining Luke's arc to you is going to make sense, but: starting at the beginning of TFA, his arc is pretty much set up perfectly.

TLJ deals in large part with the myth of Luke Skywalker - how he views himself versus how others view him. TFA sets this up multiple times across multiple characters throughout the entire film. We see people's face light up when they hear about it. Some people can't even believe that he's real. It builds to Luke's ultimate struggle and his final act, which is that all that is said of him in TFA means truly nothing to him. That's his tragedy in TLJ and the obstacle he needs to overcome. We have all the context that we need - Luke Skywalker is Luke Skywalker until he's not, which is why we jump in to his story when we do. He's expected to be Luke Skywalker, Jedi Master (set up in TFA) but we learn that he currently sees himself as Luke, Failure (set up immediately in TLJ). Now that the audience has all this information, we can now see him resolve it.

Rian Johnson says on Luke's arc:

&gt; ""If you look at any classic hero's myth that is actually worth its salt, at the beginning of the hero's journey, like with King Arthur, he pulls the sword from the stone and he's ascendant — he has setbacks but he unites all the kingdoms. But then if you keep reading, when it deals with the hero's life as they get into middle-age and beyond, it always starts to get into darker places. And there’s a reason for that: It’s because myths are not made to sell action figures; myths are made to reflect the most difficult transitions we go through in life.""

King Arthur's life doesn't really get better when he pulls the sword from the stone. It is in the short term, but for the rest of his life and his rule he faces struggles. His wife cheats on him with his most loyal servant. He is killed by his son with his own ceremonial sword. The conversation starts and stops at this point: Luke's ""late life crisis"" is inevitable based on how George Lucas built him, which is around Joseph Cambell's Hero's Journey. This is how it ends:

From the Hero's Journey, one of the last sections, Rescue From Without, states: ""Just as the hero may need guides and assistants to set out on the quest, often he must have powerful guides and rescuers to bring them back to everyday life, especially if the person has been wounded or weakened by the experience."" (cough Rey and Yoda cough)

By the end, Luke achieves what Campbell calls Freedom to Live: ""In this step, mastery leads to freedom from the fear of death, which in turn is the freedom to live. This is sometimes referred to as living in the moment, neither anticipating the future nor regretting the past."" This is achieved in spades with his showdown on Crait with Kylo.

What I'm trying to get at is that this is very hardly slopping writing, you're just not a fan of it. There's logic and purpose to it. It ""rhymes"" with the rest of Star Wars. Johnson finishes the road that Lucas began Luke down almost to mathematical precision. Luke in ANH is called to adventure, step one of the hero's journey. By the end of TLJ, he becomes the master of two worlds and is granted the freedom to live, step 17 (and the final step) of the hero's journey.

In the end, it comes down to this: just because you face darkness once doesn't mean you won't have to face it again. The myth of Luke Skywalker, his hubris, his power, his investment in his own nephew. It's inevitable, it's tragic, but in the end he returns triumphant and demonstrates the true power of a Jedi. “A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack."" Luke finally learns his final lesson and that could only be learned by failing Ben, which he finally admits.

Luke's arc is a natural continuation of his story, and it speaks volumes that the audience is just as upset as Rey is that he won't come out of his exile to help. We have a hard time understanding why he won't save the universe, just as Rey does, and a lot of people just sit and then and never try to think why Luke is the way that he is because it actually makes a lot of sense.

Last point is obviously that Rian disagrees with Luke's mentality throughout the film, and also disagrees with Kylo's ""let the past die."" I feel like people use that as a rallying cry for this film, when Rian has pretty much explicitly said that Luke is wrong for hiding and Kylo is wrong for wanting to kill the past.

Just because you don't like something doesn't mean it's sloppy or bad or careless. There is a very obvious reason why TLJ was written the way it was. You just don't like it.

And that's okay.

But this strange narrative that TLJ is poorly constructed or that Johnson doesn't understand Star Wars seriously needs to stop. It's just not true.

I will not be taking any further questions because, again, I'm tired of explaining myself and it feel like I've been fighting this battle since I was SIX YEARS OLD.

TLDR; it makes perfect sense, it's okay if you don't personally like it, but stop trying to shit on everyone's parade. All I'm trying to do here is explain why people enjoy it and praise it, and I think it makes perfect sense in that regard. Again, you don't have to like it, but hopefully this can show you that people who think this way aren't nuts - we've come to our conclusions after a lot of thought and careful consideration, so now thanks to this essay that was not worth writing you won't be ""baffled"" next time you see someone praise Luke's arc.

The question was asking if the material reality of socialism can be achieved outside of the rigid system that European dogma puts it in.

They aren't asking if a society that identifies with a socialist label can exist in a non-industrial society, but rather if socialism can since these are two different things. 

I understand that the Zapatistas don't identify with any label other than Zapatistas, but I'm simply saying they exist in a libertarian socialist society because that's the best way to describe the material reality they live in, it's simply an easy way to understand what they do.

    * Most of them ask you to give a review about an app.
    
    * There are also many tasks that ask you to buy a product (They give you amazon code, so you dont spend anything), and evaluate it (Sometimes they let you keep the product!)
    
    * I also saw some simple task like voting something or share something on facebook.
    
    * There is also another type that consist on buying a item for cheap or free, but I just saw this type of task 1 time so, I dont know a lot about it!

You install it, switch on internet sharing as per your wishes and it will start collecting money. You can only get money after you earn $20, so it might take a while if you have only one device, but it should work. If you install it on android, you might be asked to provide a reference code. If you want to use mine it is URWIT3BE. You can also instal the app using the link below:

&gt; But why can't we just say ""colonizers did harmful things"" and instead say ""colonialism is harmful.""

I think the reason people default to the later is because most of us aren't aware of any colonial relationship that was symbiotic instead of parasitic.  I genuinely don't know of any place that benefited from being colonized.  If you know of any please post.  As Catholics we do understand conversion as a benefit, but in terms of material change the forced exchange of access to western education and medicine for one's sovereignty seems murky at best imo

&gt; Is colonizing and domesticating unused territories harmful?

We don't necessarily need to look at territory as something that needs to be turned from ""unused"" to ""used.""  Just because a piece of land is not operating at full efficiency according to the interest of markets does not make it unused.  

I'm reminded of Francis in Laudato si: "" In this sense, it is essential to show special care for indigenous communities and their cultural traditions. They are not merely one minority among others, but should be the principal dialogue partners, especially when large projects affecting their land are proposed. For them, land is not a commodity but rather a gift from God and from their ancestors who rest there, a sacred space with which they need to interact if they are to maintain their identity and values. When they remain on their land, they themselves care for it best. Nevertheless, in various parts of the world, pressure is being put on them to abandon their homelands to make room for agricultural or mining projects which are undertaken without regard for the degradation of nature and culture.""

&gt; Her point that the Fr. Damien statue is an outgrowth of white supremacy is wrong. It should be no surprise that, in a country whose origins and ethnic majority are rooted in European settlers, the majority of people honored with statues are of European descent. It would be nonsensical to decry a lack of black people statues in Japan, or Latino people statues in Zimbabwe.

While I do understand what you're getting at here, the national identities of Japan and Zimbabwe are inherently different than that of the USA; I don't know too much about them specifically, but I would argue that our identity is based more on being a nation of immigrants than theirs are.  Even conceding that the majority of statues could be of white men due to our nation's demographics, I don't believe we are even close to achieving proportional minority representation in the monuments in question.  But really it's not about distributing statues to ensure proportional representation.  The point is that venerated (in the secular, national sense) __only__ people like Fr.

Het artikel noemt een halvering van de verhuurderheffing als mogelijke maatregel. Logischer is het deze heffing geheel af te schaffen.

Bij de verhuurderheffing gaat het om een bedrag van €2 mrd op jaarbasis. Hiervan betalen de woningcorporaties circa 95%. De Woningwet staat toe dat woningcorporaties financiële reserves vormen, onder voorwaarde dat deze uitsluitend in het belang van de volkshuisvesting worden aangewend. Aan dit criterium voldoet de verhuurderheffing niet. De heffing is strijdig met de letter en geest van de Woningwet. Een heffing die de staatssteun ver overtreft, komt in geen enkel ander Europees land voor.

Provocatie

Dan de huurverhoging. Als die 0,5 procentpunt hoger is dan inflatie, levert dit verhuurders ongeveer €20 mrd per jaar extra op. Maar steeds meer huurders kampen met een huurschuld. Doorvoeren van een extra huurverhoging tijdens een coronacrisis zou een provocatie zijn, die in verkiezingstijd genadeloos kan worden afgestraft. Bovendien vergroot een extra huurverhoging het beroep op huurtoeslagen, en dat kost het Rijk geld. Daarover rept het FD-artikel niet. Een inflatievolgend huurbeleid lijkt een gulden middenweg.

De derde oplossing wordt gezocht in de ambities. Door tekortschietende nieuwbouw, hogere immigratiecijfers dan geraamd, en het langer zelfstandig wonen van ouderen, is het woningtekort toegenomen tot ruim 330.000 woningen, met name in de sociale huursector.

Why do you think humans are the exception? In terms of the gulls, coyotes and wolves are indeed capable of mating and breeding together ([cute fuckers actually](https://i.imgur.com/mepCHgp.jpg)).

No, I was more about setting up regulations on foreign companies so they cannot abuse or spy on your own citizens, but what you propose is not an awful idea either considering that manufacturing centralization is a huge problem we are currently dealing with in the US and Europe and the only reason labor in China is so cheap is because their dictator is ok with multiple kinds of human rights abuses.

They are becoming the largest force in the world right next to the US. They have everything to gain and they are already doing it.

Or the WHO advising against closing borders with China when the pandemic started? China already has almost every big company in their pocket.

First, there's the censorship problem. Tiktok changing the narrative in favor of China. It has been known for censoring and banning accounts for being pro-Hong Kong, and then, there is the problem with the fact that China basically owns any Chinese company including all their information.

A national public health insurance system that anyone can enroll in is a broadly popular idea in the US, with easily over 75% supporting the idea. Even a majority of Republicans support the existence of such a program.

The devil is in the details. It's less popular when you start talking about making that insurance mandatory, or making it replace private insurance. But even that still has a majority of Americans supporting it.

That said, an optional public health insurance system is an impractical idea for a number of reasons. First and most importantly--it does nothing to reduce health care costs. It's just a way to shift the cost of healthcare onto the government rather than structurally reducing those costs or giving the government a strong tool to collectively bargain costs down.

In terms of political likelihood, the plan that will probably eventually be enacted is some sort of automatic enrollment into Medicare for everyone (but *not* a Sanders-style expansion of what Medicare covers). People who desperately want private insurance can choose to switch to a private insurer via Medicare Advantage, and people who want additional coverage beyond what traditional Medicare provides could buy (or have their employer provide) Medigap coverage. This is the most legally and politically straightforward way to address American healthcare spending problems, and Medicare is already a well established and popular program with SCOTUS approval. At a ballpark guess, I would propose that some plan of this nature would be a likely outcome if Biden is elected, the Democrats take even a bare majority in the Senate, and coronavirus continues to create a massive unemployment crisis (which *also* kicks tens of millions of Americans off their health insurance).

&gt;Yet on a conservative subreddit you will see a vilification of Pakistani culture to show how Christians are discriminated against, but no attempt at rescuing the persecuted through immigration.

What? Do you want the US to be the World Super Hero and meddle in the affairs of each and every country and single out Christians and save them and deny everyone else? I'm not sure what your point is here. Should the US give special treatment to conservative people? Also, by the by, being ""conservative"" in the US and being ""convervative"" or ""tradtional"" in the rest of world aren't the same. First of all, the rest of the entire world is much more tradtional/conservative, especially compared to typical American conservatives.

&gt;Does it not seem like a strawman argument to say that since the left believes immigrants should get free things, immigration is bad.

It's not a strawman. I'm not misrepresenting a side.  I didn't even make an arguments; I just pointed out facts to try and change your mind. The US doesn't have a problem with immigration itself, but illegal immigration.

&gt;Should you not fight for immigrants while refuting the free handouts?

I would say no. It's not American's job to just help everyone, especially literally at all times. What kind of responsibility would that be for a country? American already helps out a ton of people anyways. Who helps Americans? There is no ""fighting for immigrants."" This is how it is: you become American, you join the team, and adopt American values, and we help each other out.

&gt;And when did one fall out of the settler label?

You don't fall out of the label. People are decedents of settlers. Settlers are what founded America.

I believe at least 90% of Americans are the decedents of the label ""immigrant"" rather than ""settler"".

Well what time in history are you talking? Where you getting those numbers from? You mean now? Yeah, people did immigrant to America. No one disputes that.

I would certainly label anyone who emmigrated here in the 1800s as an immigrant rather than a settler

No one disputes legal immigrants to America.

""Conservatives"" among the world are not the same in the US. Islamic conservatives, for example, want to turn where ever they live to their culture and under Islam. They do this in Europe and don't assimilate. That's what means to be conservative. So forth and so forth this is what conservatives among the world do, not to pick on Islamic people. They don't want to change. American Conservatives don't want change either, and they want to keep their values as well, and America is a western culture based on freedom of speech and individualism, which many cultures do not understand and don't care for.

It's the reason why China had to westernize. Because it remained stuck in it's ""inwards perfection"" for centuries until a few men with better weapon crushed it effortlessly and humiliated it for centuries, including their much smaller, less populated and much younger neighbor, Japan.

It's also the reason why China is still behind the US, Europe and most importantly Japan in just about every technological endeavor: Quite simply put, the Communist system stifles innovation. It's why the Occupied Territories of the Republic of China and their dictatorship depend on espionage and theft to such a large degree.

Rules will vary by country, but you shouldn't assume you can get an orientation year-type permt in every EU country.

Apart from a possible orientation year, in NL you would need to find a job that qualifies you as a higly skilled migrant- meaning, having a government recognized sponsor as an employer and making a salary above the threshold for this permit, see https://ind.nl/en/work/working_in_the_Netherlands/Pages/Highly-skilled-migrant.aspx

Your questions:

&gt;What would happen if I got a job for a bit, but then stopped working to travel while on a working permit? Would I lose it? 

Yes, you would lose it. Your permit is tied to your job. If you lose your job, you'll have a grace period of max 90 days to find another job that qualifies you for a highly skilled migrant permit. You and your employer are obligated to inform the immigration services that you stopped working that job.

&gt;When countries mention ""uninterrupted"" time frames in which one must reside in a country, does this mean you are not allowed to leave at all?

You can travel, but should remain a resident. There's norms for this: see https://ind.nl/en/Pages/main-residence.aspx

&gt;Some countries mention that you cannot leave for more than x% of time during the length of your residency, how do they keep track of the percentage or amount of time you are out of the country?

For starters, this is a pretty unlikely scenario. Most people have insurance of some sort, and they all have annual out of pocket maximums, usually in the range of just a few thousand dollars. Hospitals are extremely willibg to work out payment plans for these bills. I'm prett comfortable saying that most families can swing that, especially spread out over a few years. If you're actually uninsured, or you truly cannot afford that bill (both would likely be caused by unemployment), hospitals have indigency review boards with a lot of latitude to outright forgive the debt. 


&gt;I know conservatives hate the ideal of government run healthcare, but in all sincerity nobody has ever explained to me a practical reason why we can’t at least have basic medical care available to our citizens.

One of the most basic reasons for this is our constitution does not provide any basis of authority for establishing something like that. Another is that it is extremely difficult to find a solution that would work well for ~350 million people. Something like that would be better handled by the respective states. Think about it like a solution that has to work for all of Europe, versus one devised by each of the member countries. 

Lastly, I firmly believe that, while there a a few jobs that can only be handled by government, it is just about always the worst tool for any given job.

Now I bought a boat and unfortunately I now need money. Havent worked the fiest 2 1/2 years but now I have to. And I never felt so free. Because every job I turn up to I dont really need it. So I just do things my way, and if the bosses dont like it I quit at the most inconvenient times for them. I dont give a damn anymore. Whats the worst that can happen? I cant pay my mooring so I just sail away. 

Once I was working in a fruit company doing the packaging and I was basically doing 4 different tasks at once. I unloaded the heavy boxes of fruits and put them on the band, I folded the boxes, I also had to label the boxes and bring the empty packaging away. At the same time. If I labelled the boxes no one folded the boxes and no one could pack the fruit. If I folded the boxes there was no one to label them and youd quickly run out, if I didnt unload the heavy boxes then there would be no fruit to pack, and if I didnt bring the empty packaging away there was no room to move. 

So whenever I did something I was send to the other task. Whenever I did the labels the supervisor would come and push me away from the table and label a few boxes and told me to fold the boxes (instead of just letting me continue with the labelling and shed fold the boxes) which is okay until she leaves after 5 minutes to do something more interesting. 

I remember I motioned her to move through the gap so I can go the other direction and do my job, she stood there and motioned me to gpvthrough but stands in the middle of the way. So I tell her ""go through!"" and she insisted I walk through. Like what the heck. So I just walked right into her and bumped her out of the way. Dunno what she was expecting but she got hysteric. So I just took off my gloves, threw them at her and told her that Im off for the day and I am only sorry because I wont be able to see her struggle with the 20kg baskets of fruit. She can fuck right off. 

I knew there was no one else they could delegate to do my tasks.

So next day I got a call from my agency and they were furious. They said the entire ""team"" came to an halt because I walked out and the company didnt meet their deadline and lost a lot of money. 

Obviously expecting me to be apologetic. They were kinda shocked when I told them that I dont feel sorry at all and I do my best but I cant do everything at once and I would definitely do it again.

No really!!? Of course. And yet peple cherry pick which countries they want to generalize and which ones do not. 

&gt;As an aside, how can you say that about people when I’m one whining about people saying fuck Israel and everyone I know knows enough that the people in these countries are totally fine. It’s their governments that are the issue.

Because, (if you actually paid attention to the point I was making) I was making the important observation that the overwhelming people who type the exact same comment like you did love to be hypocrites and throwout their line of reasoning when it comes to cultures/ethnic groups/countries they vehemently despise (china/iran etc.).

Are you this kind of hypocrite? I don't know. But an overwhelming number of the people who upvote and agree with your point sure are these kinds of hypocrites.

&gt;This sounds like it’s coming from someone who hasn’t traveled outside their home state/country.

Well that was very ignorant and stupid of you to say. What does traveling have anything with what your original comment was about?

I have been to dozens of countries in Western/northern europe, I've been to East Asia, East Africa, Central America, the Caribbean dozens of times.

&gt;None of the travelers spoke like that

Nobodies cares at all if these ""travelers"" don't ""speak like that"". I am talking about a specific narrow group of people on social media who fervently hate certain countries and love to make generalizations but throw a fit when it comes to countries like Israel, Poland, Hungary, France etc.
