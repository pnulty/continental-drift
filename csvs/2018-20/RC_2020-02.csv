Think about how those countries are conduits for UK and US businesses to gain greater and greater wealth (and some are explicit tax havens).

I'm not sure what you're getting at by this.

I should add that Spaniards only ever made up a small percentage of the American populace during colonial times, with the majority being indigenous. And that while tactical intermarriage between elites happened as I described in that post, mixing was due more to rape and forced marriages in the conquest and early colonial periods; and to illicit relationships  (concubinage) during the colonial middle.

Is it common for Japanese women to use men for only English learning?

&gt; Dated this japanese girl I met at a party. We hit it off the first time we met, she was touchy and into me so then I asked her out. First date we had to reschedule so we met at a club for the second she was down to dance with me, I asked her if she was comfortable and liked it she said yes andi said if not she can tell me. Yet later in that night she dipped then blocked me on IG. 
&gt; 
&gt; Recently found her on tinder and says she’s looking for someone to teach her English as the bio lol. 
&gt; 
&gt; I’m wondering if maybe her whole intention was that and because I had no intention of being a teacher she ghosted me. I used to hang with more international japanese and noticed they were very keen on doing that to guys so is this just common?

&gt; For some reason I never experience this with Korean, Chinese or European internationals.

This explains literally nothing. You seem to think capitalism and sales are two interchangeable words they're not. Capitalism is an economic and political system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit, rather than by the state. If individuals didn't own any wealth or capitol there would be nothing to donate to charities.

You are aware that its the capitalist countries that give the most to charities universally right?

Not how CEO pay works. You don't understand what you are talking about so this is unsurprisingly a bad example.

Humanity isn't, and never was, all that predesposed towards monogamy.

Historically speaking, there have been a wide variety of cultures that handle family/romantic/child-rearing duties in ways other than a monogamous pair. That is a recent idea.


Historically in the west, for example, family units which included grandparents, aunts and uncles all lived on the same homestead and children were raised either by the direct family unit or collectively within the village.

Romantically speaking, in the west, true monogamous relationships hold a questionable majority. Prostitution is the oldest job in the world, that has survived every attempt to outlaw it. Everyone with political or economic power (from barons to Kings to merchants) used to keep mistresses - because for the overwhelming history of Christian Europe, marriages were transactional. People did not marry for pair ponding reasons. People married to consolidate land, power, and ensure family legacy via inheriting heirs. Marriage for the sake of maintaining a loving,.exclusive pair unit is historically very recent.


If you go past Christian history in Europe and look at Rome - monogamy was not the expected social practice for the overwhelming history of the Roman empire. Gay relationships were not frowned on so long as you were the ""top"" partner. I personally heavily dissaprove of.it, but Greek and Rome are known to have had an open mind/fandom for pedastry/gay relationships between male mentor and mentee, that had nothing to do with marriage.

And this doesn't even begin to touch on the Germanic tribe's (and several other European groups pre-christiandom) history with Polygamy.

There are a very wide number of historic cultures where polygamy were very much the norm, in the middle east, Africa and Asia, Greece and Rome - because women were viewed as chattel and you won their marriage in war.

The Bible literally includes polygamy and the marrying of the women of conquered enemy tribes in addition to keeping wives of your own. The Illiad and Oddesey mention polygamy as accepted practice by the warrior class as well. Historically, conquered women entering as a second or third wife is common.

Monogamy is *not* a historical truth for Western culture, much less world culture. Again, it's literally part of our formative Judeo-Christian texts.

[],,ILikeNeurons,1350619483.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_9cki6,False,True,[],"Well, regarding Main Point 1, I can say that [carbon pricing is widely regarded as the single most impactful climate mitigation policy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-019-0474-0.epdf?author_access_token=tst1A-oZnQ8zUO18wGGPQdRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0Nfy3PIgvrwnNXQzIbXH8z1Wkqhm6g5NiMnxMk__ebsKxGQNB0hMf1Vpo-ZiNplSt5LeLyks-Q3sdrpBdfxxHvAfQylqqwqHxgEml7GEGOxaQ%3D%3D), which is the opposite of a false solution. The IPCC states with [high confidence](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_summary-for-policymakers.pdf) that carbon taxes are effective, and you can see numerous examples (e.g. [here](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter15.pdf), [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069615000613), and [here](http://archive.economonitor.com/dolanecon/2013/07/08/why-progressives-should-love-a-carbon-tax-although-not-all-of-them-do/)) that [carbon taxes work](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/145038/1/cesifo1_wp6003.pdf). 

Regarding Main Point 2, I can agree that **low** carbon taxes are not as effective as **high** carbon taxes, but [they're not always low](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/31755/211435KeyFigures.pdf?sequence=5&amp;isAllowed=y), and if we want a higher carbon tax we need more political will, which [CCL volunteers create](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/about-ccl/). Fighting the policy is not a very good way to build political will for it. We know how to create political will, and [CCL offers free training](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/join-citizens-climate-lobby/?tfa_3590416195188=reddit-IAmA&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=IAmA) to volunteers willing to learn. 

Main Point 3 is not about carbon taxes. 

Regarding Main Point 4, while arguably true, is also arguably true of all technologies that claim lives (like cars, boats, trains, etc.) but as a society we have chosen to accept certain risks to gain certain benefits. The issue with fossil fuels is really that [the market is failing](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/10_Principles_of_Economics#Government_can_sometimes_improve_market_outcomes). 

Regarding Main Point 5, [the evidence suggests](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09644016.2018.1457287?journalCode=fenp20) racists are more likely to be climate deniers. I haven't seen evidence they are more likely to support carbon pricing.

It was their hatred of migrants and being overtaken that sparked the notion and then the narrative began to include and focus more on the fact that Europe is a “controlling force” and that Britain deserved to be “”free””.  The politicians and demographics that advocated it were &gt;are&lt; essentially harkening back to the glory days of an Empire that doesn’t exist anymore. 

Anyway. When it actually (for some inexplicable reason) started to become a reality we began to see just how detached a lot of Brits (not even just the Tories) were from reality and how clueless they were about the long-standing connection between our two countries. Because of their long-held grip over Ireland, Brexit was going to hit us hard and they didn’t even bother to care very much when we voiced our concerns over it. It was like they forgot they created this historic entanglement in the first place and they had the nerve to spend the last few years moaning about how much of a say the EU was giving us on the situation, considering the deep trade links and ties we have with them etc. Simply put. Jobs will be lost. A lot of our sectors will take a huge hit and the whole way through there hasn’t even been much curtesy and little acknowledgement of this economic interdependence, or how their decision would affect us. Brexit revived anti-Irish sentiment from their politicians and everyday people alike too. Time and time again, they threw Ireland under the bus for the delay of Brexit, particularly because of our concern with the Border and peace in Northern Ireland. Backstop became a dirty word in Westminster. They wanted it gone, even though it was there for a very good reason. For a long time it seemed as though they weren’t going to budge on something so vital for both English/Irish citizens in the North. It kinda felt that the Good Friday Agreement meant nothing to them. They treated the border like it was a small inconvenience that was in their way and not something that preserves a very delicate balance.

This is called an association fallacy. It's a typical cop-out of theism. 

&gt; Now think of the Worst 10 hellholes you'd never want to set foot in. Guaranteed 10/10 of them are Islamic or Communist-Atheist nations.

Islam and Christianity are practically the same religion, and western nations still struggle with the consequences of sexist, racism, homophobia, and patriarchal oppression no thanks to this (singular) cult. 

And communism is the language of religion without the gods. It's misinformation conveyed through shame, peer pressure, insinuations and appeals to emotion. Like any other snake oil. Which this is an example of. 

They even come from the same part if the world. Monotheism from the indo'european invasions outward from the Eurasian steeps, and communism from the same place, now south west Russia.

&gt; You have no idea how good you have it in countries with a strong Christian influence. 

Christian ideals are what brought slavery to America. We don't have freedom and democracy because of Christian ideals. You can thank a bunch of pagans, notable Plato, Aristotle and Socrates for that. 

&gt; Romans had certain taxes that specifically targeted widows and orphans (e.g., ""Aes Equestre"" and ""Aes Hordeariuma,"" taxes to maintain military horses).

Which makes all pagans bad? What a cheery picked excuse. 

&gt; So get out of here with the ""thousands of years of disparity and oppression"" nonsense. You have no idea what you're talking about

Leviticus 20:13 

‘If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be **put to death;** their blood will be on their own heads.

Just one example of oppression directly from the Bible. Lgbt were executed for hundreds if years because if the Bible. The Bible is why women couldn't own property or get a job. Taxing single women would be rediculous in a Christian state since they weren't allowed to own in the first place. And Christians are undoubtedly responsible for crusades, conquests and colonialism, which resulted in the genocides of millions. 

You're the one that's ignorant if the history of your own religion. Or even of the values of western society. Hell if you could even cite one you might learn better. But that's not how a theist reasons, is it. By supporting their claims with facts. Instead you rely on fallacies and qualifiers and obvious non specific bullshit. Christianity is responsible for a dark ages, hundreds of years of lost literacy and technology, and has poised itself as an obstacle to science and progress for even longer. Without Christianity we would certainly be better off. After all, it was the pagan religions and not Christianity that lead up to western values.

As a power move britain's prime minister calls out a referendum to the question ""should Britain remain in the eu"". He didn't expect it to actually be won by ""leave"", but of course as you know it won. He resigns so as to not deal with the mess. 

The leave campaign is rooted mostly in two issues: Immigration and regulation. Right Winged politicians claim (lying with all their teeth) that the European Union forces the Uk to give more money than they get back to Europe. One of the most striking images is the lie that Boris Johnson has about ""350 million pounds a week to the EU will now go to the NHS"" (national healthcare service). He later admitted that was total bogus by the way and as current prime minister he has actually slashed the NHS. I digress.

The other issue is Immigration. Under EU rules any citizen of any of the 28 members  can freely travel. It's feasible to go from Lisbon to Finland, and cross every country in its path with just your id without ever seeing border patrol. As an Island the British enjoyed a bit more autonomy in that they kept their borders patrolled and had more of a say in who could cross but even so a lot of british people felt that, in particular, Portugal gave citizenship to people from former colonies and those people didn't stay in Portugal and came to the Uk, where they - well it's pretty much the same as mexicans are claimed to do in the US. They ""took their jobs"".

So really though it's vastly more complex than that (and why it has been negotiated so very much) those are the main reasons ""close our borders"" and ""Don't give more money to Europe"" (as a note, economists estimate that EU economical benefits actually helped the British Economy - especially in terms of corporations.

A new coronavirus, designated 2019-nCoV, was identified in late 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, after people developed pneumonia without a clear cause and for which existing treatments were not effective. The virus can spread between people, and its transmission rate (rate of infection) appeared to increase in mid-January 2020. Several countries across Europe, North America and the Asia-Pacific have reported cases. The time from exposure to the development of symptoms is between two and 14 days and there is tentative evidence that it may be  contagious before the onset of symptoms.

Current estimates for the cost of Brexit run around £130billion. Projected to be more like £200billion by the time Brexit actually happens. True, these are estimates, but by all accounts so far they're at least ballpark-accurate. Another more conservative estimate has it as more like £100billion to-date. 

Total cost of all payments to the EU since 1974? £215 billion, adjusted for inflation. 

If payments to the EU were just a one-way street, then things might not seem so stupid. At worst, we would be losing -slightly- less than what we paid in 40 years. 

However, those payments aren't actually one-way. We receive a big ol' fuckton of money back from the EU through various projects. For example, there are around ~30 projects in Cornwall alone, that have been funded by EU grants, some of them in the scale of £300million to £400million. These projects will now no longer exist, as the funding isn't available. 

Unless you think the Tories are going to start funding these things? Like they said they would fund the NHS? Sorry, they're not doing that either. 

So our actual NET expenditure for being a member of the EU ends up being significantly less than the £215billion then. So all the people who voted because they were told that ""All their tax money was going to Europe and being spent on ...immigrants, or something"" were, at best, misinformed. (Lied to, lets be honest here, the whole campaign was a pack of lies. It's been proven, multiple times.)

So what do we GET from leaving the EU? What's the actual benefit? 

More money? Not really. We don't have to spend anything on Europe anymore, but that also means we no longer get all the trade benefits etc etc etc that we used to get, so at best we will be no better off than before, and at worst the UK will have to spend large sums of additional money just to end up with a similar trade situation. Net loss. Unless you think that the UK is such a 'strong economic power' that the world will be bending over backwards to give us favourable trade deals? In which case, you're delusional. 

The ability to set our own laws? We already could. The ability to fight against EU laws and parliament? We already did that too. Now we can't. 

Oh, here's a big one. Immigration. We can close our borders to those filthy immigrants, coming and taking all our jobs. Right? Right? Nope. Large numbers of those immigrants weren't even from the EU anyway, so nothing will change there. And any trade deals with the EU (which we need, see previous points) will require the UK agreeing to certain border agreements, because that's how the EU works and that's already been stated in all the EU deals that have been offered. So... yup, absolutely not changes to immigration either. 

So what do we get? Nothing much. Parliament gets to make the UK a tax haven, so rich people (oh look, the people in government and the media who lobbied for Brexit in the first place, remember those guys?) can keep their money tax free, while simultaneously increasing taxes for the people who can't afford it. And... that's about it, really. And what does it cost us? 

Somewhere in the region of £500million a week in lost growth.

EDIT: Wow, there are so many misconceptions here about the tipping system in the US, and from Americans, too.  I mentioned this in a reply below, but I'll say it again here.  Many states only require that tipped employees be paid 2.13 an hour.  Some states are $2.50.  Some have the same minimum wage for tipped and non-tipped employees (the lucky ones).  Employers are not ever responsible for paying more than the state minimum wage for tipped employees.  If you don't make the state minimum wage for non-tipped employees on your shift, you're SOL.  However, servers are required to report 10% of their total sales as tipped income, regardless of how much they actually received.  If you don't claim 10% after each shift, you will end up with allocated tips when you file taxes at the end of the year, and the IRS will force you to pay taxes on it.  Working in a state that paid 2.13 to servers, my paychecks from the restaurant were for $0, after taxes.

Yes, the system sucks big time.  I actually noticed that I received much better service in European restaurants because this ridiculous system isn't used.

I'd highly suggest going with one that covers anything medical related and can cover if your baggage goes missing or if flights get cancelled. I've never had it happen to me but the only insurance I swear by is travel insurance. They often have international numbers you can call as well if something happens on matter where you are. They usually have deals with airlines and direct contacts so you can avoid having those conversations. A travel agent would just be an extra person to call and a bit more money.

Places like STA prey on young and clueless travellers mainly because they're trying to test out their independence for the first time and it's like a stepping stone between that and using your own autonomy. You'd be surprised that there is a weird joy to planning out your own trip and just being as careful as you go. Making budgets, making lists and just being aware that doing your own bookings pose the same risks as if going through a travel agent.

Just remember at the end of the day with everyone you're dealing with that you're adults, you're human and you probably speak the same language.

Is the EU really undemocratic?

Unlike the United Nations or the World Trade Organisation, only democracies can join the European Union. In theory, EU member states that slide back on democratic standards can be sanctioned, although this is easier said than done.

But aren’t a bunch of unelected bureaucrats in charge?

Actually, they aren’t. When people talk about “the unelected bureaucrats of Brussels”, they usually mean the European commission. The commission is an organisation like no other: more than a civil service but less than a government. Composed of 28 commissioners – one from each country – the commission drafts, enforces and monitors EU laws. But it does not pass laws.

That does not mean the commission is not powerful: the EU competition commissioner can block mergers and fine multinational companies staggering sums computer chip maker Intel was fined a record €1.06bn (then £852m) for anti-competitive practices. But these powers rest on treaties and laws decided by EU governments. Similarly when it comes to striking trade agreements, the commission’s powers are restricted. The EU trade commissioner negotiates on a mandate drawn up by EU member states – the opening of controversial TTIP talks with the US was based on a unanimous decision by EU member states. If TTIP survives, it can only enter into force with the approval of governments and the European parliament.

The commission cannot foist laws upon EU member states. For example, the commission spent eight years trying to get EU countries to agree to a law on cleaning up Europe’s contaminated soils, but eventually withdrew the bill in the face of an immovable blocking majority, which included the UK.

One of the biggest gripes of Eurosceptics is the extension of qualified-majority voting, which allows the British government to be outvoted. A swathe of EU policies are now decided by these weighted-majority votes, such as environment, agriculture and transport. More sensitive policies, including tax, defence and foreign policy, have to be agreed by unanimity.

Under QMV, a law passes if it is backed by 16 out of 28 countries that make up at least 65% of the EU population. The UK has 13% of the EU population, so gets a 13% vote share.

Research by the London School of Economics found that the UK was on the winning side 87% of the time between 2009-15. So the British government does have to accept some EU decisions it didn’t vote for. One of the most high-profile losses in recent years, was when the chancellor, George Osborne, was outvoted on an EU law to restrict bankers bonuses. In this case, more than three quarters of the British public, including 68% of Conservative voters, supported the EU proposal.

National parliaments can also throw a spanner in the works if they don’t like an EU law. If one third of national parliaments oppose a draft law, the commission must review it, a procedure known as the yellow card. If more than half of national parliaments oppose a law, this could force a vote in the European parliament or council, (the orange card). In his February reform deal, the prime minister, David Cameron, persuaded EU leaders to introduce a red card, meaning the commission would be forced to adapt or drop the law if more than half of national parliaments objected. The yellow card has only been used twice, the orange card has never been used and the red card will only come into force if the UK votes to remain in the EU.",False,False,False,,,0,1580541376,,False,0,{},fg5w4wt,False,t3_ewwlpz,False,False,t1_fg5o9gb,/r/worldnews/comments/ewwlpz/the_united_kingdom_exits_the_european_union/fg5w4wt/,False,,1589049696,21,True,False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,r/worldnews,public,0,[],

But tariff trading is obviously fundamentally against the concept of the inner market as I'm sure you know, and the UK currently has made a brexit deal which keeps them as a member of the inner market and under the regulations put in place by the EU

The EU trades plenty with other countries outside the Schengen area, but in that case it of course includes tariffs. I must admit that I don't actually know if the Schengen was a specific requirement for the EU to allow Switzerland into the inner market, or if this was a mutual agreement, and Switzerland wanted to be part of the Schengen area. The schengen agreement do offer some advantages when it comes to trading, since it naturally makes trading between European nations faster and with less bureaucracy, oversight and border control.

Turkey isn't a member of the single market and never was. The only non-eu members part of the inner market so far is Norway and Switzerland. I do not know the specifics of the current EU-Turkish trade-agreement, but tariffs are very much in effect at the moment.

And yes regulations apply domestically for all members of the single market. The point the EU claims to be of the inner market when it comes to trade-deal negotiations is to have a uniform point of reference on what type and quality of goods the nations outside of EU can expect to buy and sell, and the point of restriction of independent trade-deals is the idea that the EU making deals collectively increases it's bargain power as the collective market is bigger and more powerful.

Storbritanniens EU-utträde innebär ett nytt kapitel i EU:s historia och dagens anföranden syftar till att blicka framåt mot de specifika inre och yttre utmaningar som måste hanteras under de kommande åren, och reflektera över hur man från EU:s håll ska bli bättre på att involvera medborgarna, civilsamhället och de nationella parlamenten i debatterna och beslutsfattandet som kommer att forma Europas framtid.

In reality, however, politics will determine this. The EU is actively courting the Scots regardless of the legal situation.

Strictly speaking the Scots are helpless captives of Westminster, but if the Scottish people are unified and determined to split from Downing St and return to the EU, who is to stop them? 

Even the Peter Pan of clowns isn't silly enough to start a Scottish war. They are a stubborn and stoic people; even the Romans couldn't subdue the Scots.

Another legal hurdle is that all EU States must agree to accept new member states. Theoretically, Scotland could go through the drama of leaving the UK, only to have Transylvania veto their re-entry to the EU.

Politics should and will determine the outcome of this. It's good to have rules but international diplomacy should not be defined by black letter legal niceties.

If a nation has a clear direction and purpose, and what they want to do will benefit peace and prosperity, I don't see that being prevented just because it isn't in the By-laws.

There's no precedent for this. It's going to be a fascinating thing to watch. Essentially the UK is the last remnant of the British Empire. Ireland Scotland and Wales have been loyal and constructive members, but they are colonies, conquered by force.

The distinction tends to be that Existentialism emphasizes individuals determining their own meaning in a world where there seems to lack any objective meaning or teleology. Absurdism is recognizing life, altogether, id ultimately meaningless, yet to keep going anyway. Some have critiqued it as just a more pessimistic existentialism, with Camus asserting value in rebelling against the Absurd. 

Honestly, I’d say some of the best examples for Existentialism are Kierkegaard (Either/Or is probably his best work) and, maybe, Heidegger (though he is notoriously hard to read; an introductory book will suffice).

Really, the Federation is no different from the EU -- but at a different scale. Sure, humanity has put aside its war and united under a common rule of law, and has likewise united with other species. 

But what still happens afterwards? Conflict with Klingons, Romulans, Cardassians, Borg, the Dominion, ec. Hell, humans still have conflicts with ourselves (e.g., Maquis).

Gene Roddenberry is not a prophet who's provided us with a holy text that unlocks how we should perceive Star Trek.

No, we all have critical minds, and we should exercise them sufficiently. For this reason, I examine the actual story, not St. Gene &amp; Co.'s interpretation of the story.

&gt; The point is that overall humanity will evolve to something better, despite problems and issues arising.

What actual evidence is there that humanity has evolved? On the contrary, what the actual *stories* of Star Trek tell us is that humanity has not changed. [Quark said it best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D2SHNqkjbY).

There are many accepted definitions, all closely interrelated.

A inversão de valores amplifica a voz da orgulhosa mulher de bandido que tem movimentação financeira imensa e sem justificativa, não quer fazer biometria e a digital na identidade está falsificada


Esta mulher está acima da sua convivência e conivência com o bandido, a mulher que comentou sobre isso, a curta e grossa, recebeu ataques machistas e racistas por ser branca. Chegaram a dizer que só bastava chamar de branca para desmerece-la

Sério

Ser negro não serve de nada quando uma multidão se une para derrubar você por motivos imbecil, apenas dirão que quero usar a cor da minha pele para não sofrer o justo castigo de ser uma pessoa de merda, pelos critérios lá deles, enquanto que a verdade dos fatos que o banco Itaú apresentou desde o primeiro segundo da notícia não vale de nada quando resolvem exaltar a narrativa de que somos um país racista mesmo que sejamos o mais miscigenado que jamais conheci.

O que torna negros criveis? O que faz com que pessoas brancas se sintam no poder de me chamar de portadora de vagina, me proibir de me chamar de mulher biológica e me escorraçar de diversos lugares e aceitar a palavra da mulher do dj dos bandidos?

Para acabar com o racismo criaram um conceito racista que pune vozes dissonantes negras e premia vozes alinhadas.

Obviamente, reforça o racismo.

Por fim, convêm também adicionar notas em passagens que tratam dalguns acontecimentos históricos, pois como que o autor o escreveu em 1922, este assume que o leitor àquela época teria bastante conhecimento do cenário pelo qual passava a Europa após a Grande Guerra, mas como que já se passaram quase cem anos até então, não são todos que conhecem a respeito de bolchevismo, do expansionismo da União Soviética pelo leste europeu e da Guerra Húngaro-Romena de 1919.

And yes: There are ""jumps"" in numbers every time you hit ""update""...

The virus has shown evidence of human-to-human transmission, and its rate of infection appeared to increase in mid-January 2020, with several countries across Europe, North America and the Asia-Pacific reporting cases. The incubation period is between 2 and 10 days. There is evidence that it can be contagious before the onset of symptoms.

I have no idea, I don’t run the country or the EU Commission. Nothing to say you couldn’t leave the UK the day before you join the EU, there’s a million ways to do it and it’s a fundamentally unique situation given we’ve already been in the EU (and the EU seems to be _very openly_ welcoming us back in).

We don’t have to take on any of the UK national debt, although we likely would as part of a trade/free movement deal with England. Even then it would be negotiable and this phobia of debt is a holdover from the financial crisis which wasn’t caused in any way, shape or form by debts in public finances. We may need to borrow for a while to make up the shortfall, big deal.

#WRONG. 

The framers of the Constitution knew full well that abuse of power was an impeachable offense..

&gt;Alan Dershowitz, has insisted that the Constitution’s “high crimes and misdemeanors” include only crimes found in the statute books, not abuse of power.

&gt;That’s obviously wrong. In 1725, in a case the framers knew, Thomas, Earl of Macclesfield, was impeached by the British House of Commons specifically for “Abuse of his Power” and “great Abuse of his Authority.” The House of Lords convicted him for it.

&gt;At the constitutional convention, on July 20, 1787, Edmund Randolph, the governor of Virginia who had introduced the Virginia plan, stated specifically that “the propriety of impeachments was a favorite principle with him” because “the Executive will have great opportunitys of abusing his power.”

&gt;In Federalist 65, Alexander Hamilton defined “high crimes and misdemeanors” as “those offenses which proceed 
from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust.”

Yuri Lutsenko, Ukraine’s prosecutor general said he told Giuliani that he would be happy to cooperate if the FBI or other U.S. authorities began their own investigation of the former vice president and his son Hunter but insisted they had not broken any Ukrainian laws to his knowledge.

**“I said, ‘Let’s put this through prosecutors, not through presidents,’ ” [Lutsenko told The Times.](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2019-09-29/former-ukraine-prosecutor-says-no-wrongdoing-biden) ""I told him I could not start an investigation just for the interests of an American official,” he said.**

#WRONG.

They started investigating **Burisma Holdings** for corruption prior to Hunter being on the board. They were not investigating Biden directly. 

Daria Kaleniuk, executive director of Ukraine's Anti-Corruption Action Center, told The Washington Post for a July article that Corrupt Ukraine Inspector General Viktor Shokin ""**was not investigating. He didn't want to investigate Burisma. And Shokin was fired not because he wanted to do that investigation, but quite to the contrary, because he failed that investigation.""
**
&gt;His mind is gone the only reason his handlers are forcing him to run is to cover up massive corruption

Not sure what you're trying to say here. Can you clarify your statement in English? 

The State Department claimed in 2014 that there was no conflict of interest with Hunter being on the board, noting Biden was a “private citizen.”

Shokin was widely seen -- by Ukrainian activists, US diplomats, European governments and the International Monetary Fund --[ as ineffective or corrupt.](https://www.ft.com/content/e1454ace-e61b-11e9-9743-db5a370481bc) In a speech in 2015, Geoffrey Pyatt, then the US ambassador to Ukraine, castigated Shokin's office for impeding the investigation of Burisma's owner Zlochevsky. [Pyatt called for people in Shokin's office to be fired, ""at minimum.""](https://voxukraine.org/en/remarks-by-us-ambassador-geoffrey-pyatt-at-the-odesa-financial-forum/)
""Rather than supporting Ukraine's reforms and working to root out corruption, corrupt actors within the prosecutor general's office are making things worse by openly and aggressively undermining reform,"" Pyatt said.

 [**Biden was acting in accordance with official US policy.**](https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/23/politics/fact-check-trump-ukraine-hunter-biden-joe-biden/index.html) 

Because of Shokin's reputation, the US and its allies believed that removing him would increase, not decrease, the chances of people like Zlochevsky being pursued.
[""What former Vice President Biden requested of former President of Ukraine, \(Petro\) Poroshenko, was the removal of a corrupt prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin,""](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2019/nov/12/who-george-kent/) George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, testified in the impeachment inquiry. Kent went on to say Shokin had ""undermined"" a US-funded program to try to investigate corrupt Ukrainian prosecutors.

What happened today, according to Salvini, ""is an important day for democracy, for Europe it remains to be seen. I have no prejudices, neither for nor against it""

&amp;#x200B;

Now some further considerations on italian politics, Europe and some international stances (I can't really find many articles in english so if you don't know italian you'll have to trust me, I didn't want to talk about stuff with no sources)

[Back in 2016 his opinion was quite different](https://twitter.com/matteosalvinimi/status/746422505892544514) (FREE! Now it's our turn!) as he praised the Brexit referendum and hoped something similar would happen in Italy and the other populist party (M5S) was for a referendum on the Euro, but when M5S has been in power in the last couple of years (both in the previous League+M5S and in the current PD+M5S government) they didn't talk about it and the **M5S appointed president has good relations with most European leaders and the EU** and [he feels very comfortable with the Euro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDhP6TIJpE&amp;t=1m10s), he sees it as the currency of his grandchildrens

(*for the ones who don't know recent italian politics from June 2018 to August 2019 there was a government lead by Giuseppe Conte supported by Lega (far-right anti-immigration eurosceptics) and M5S (anti-establishment populists, some say left-wing). Since September 2019 there's a new government supported by M5S and PD (center-left) but lead by the same president*)

&amp;#x200B;

While Salvini changed his view to ""let's improve the EU from the inside"" and it seems like he's trying to avoid the discussion about Itexit or whatever lately, I'm not really sure his supporters agree, at least judging by the comments on socials

In the past he also made a distinction between the EU and the Euro as a currency and in a [recent interview](https://www.ilfoglio.it/politica/2019/10/15/video/salvini-manda-in-crisi-borghi-e-bagnai-sull-italexit-280631/) he said that **Italy abandoning Euro on its own wouldn't make any sense** but if there will be discussions about changes in the EU monetary policy in the future he will be available, after in a [previous interview](https://www.ilfoglio.it/politica/2019/10/14/news/prove-di-salvini-2-0-280232/) **he said that Euro is irreversible** and he didn't want to get rid of it. He **corrected it by saying that the only irreversible thing in this world is death**, and he still thinks that the Euro didn't help Italy's economy at all so far, but that's what Italy is using so they have to work with what they have now

It seems like he's moving to slightly more moderate positions on the subject for now, although some sceptics may remember that the League plan to get rid of the Euro was to do it undercover, not talking about it, and then getting rid of it in the weekend or whatever when the stock market, banks or whatever are closed, although I don't think they would really be that crazy, and considering how much it took the UK to just leave the EU I don't think that Italy could get rid of the Euro overnight

&amp;#x200B;

The **other italian nationalist far-right party FDI** (Brothers of Italy, I know it may sound silly to non-italians but it's a phrase taken from the italian national anthem, it's probably meant to be patriotic) has **grown a lot last year** (from 3% to 11% in the polls, confirmed by the 9-10% they took in the last regional elections) and according to multiple [italian newspapers](https://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/times-giorgia-meloni-i-20-personaggi-che-potrebbero-plasmare-mondo-ACXoWT9) its leader (Giorgia Meloni) is considered one of the 20 people who may change the world in 2020 by the Times (I can't see the Times article as it seems like it's behind a paywall but some major italian newspapers covered the news so I don't think it's fake news or something). Changing the world is exaggerated imo, but **she will likely be quite important in italian politics from now on**

I'm not really sure about their exact stance on the EU, FDI is a eurosceptic party and they keep attacking EU institutions and stuff, but I don't know if they talked about Itexit or similar stuff. They're currently in the ECR group (European Conservatives and Reformists), which is about reforming the EU rather than abandoning it

It seems like she's favored among american conservatives as a key far-right figure in Italy as she [participated to the CPAC 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QgpqCfBg2E) (Conservative Political Action Conference) in the USA and she will be at the CPAC 2020 as well, and she will also attend a meeting in Washington Trump will take part in next week, while Salvini was not invited. According to [some articles](https://rep.repubblica.it/pwa/generale/2019/11/27/news/fdi_meloni_va_alla_casa_bianca_trump_punta_su_giorgia_e_salvini_ora_la_teme-242074556/) **Salvini is not favored by American conservatives due to its pro-Putin positions** and also due to a scandal about Lega receiving funds from Russians

&amp;#x200B;

In my personal opinion I think that FDI could potentially take the place of Lega as the main far-right italian nationalist party in the long run, either because it will keep growing or because Lega will rethink some of their extreme positions. An advantage of FDI is that it was born as a nationalist party from the ground up while Lega was born as an anti-South North-independence party and just recently became an italian nationalist party, so lots of people in the South still don't trust them (Salvini himself was recorded singing a known north italian stadium chant against people from Naples in 2009).

I have always recognised the benefits of being part of the EU,  however I do not believe in centralisation of power. Being from just outside Belfast I cannot see how a foreign government can effectively legislate for many diverse regions.

My vote came from a few points,

1 - distrust of politicians

I knew that there would be little to no truth in the campaigns or if there was it would be so swallowed in the mire that you wouldn’t be able to recognise it.

Because of this I chose to base my vote on the question to myself “am I a hypocrite?” 

Due to my dislike of centralisation of power I have always been Bock of my dislike of the EU, so I voted the way of my previous complaints

2 - Irish nationalism

With the current status quo and relatively stable political situation in the north of Ireland I know that no one would really chose a United ireland - grand political ideals are just that, they aren’t worth risking peace and stability (particularly in a place that has suffered so much)

My theory was that if the leave vote would be successful, all that binds Scotland to the union would be eroded and the would leave the UK. This hasn’t happened yet but it is clearly on the cards for the future.

If Scotland leave the UK then there is no longer a cultural tie with the UK from the north, after all the unionists mostly see themselves as Ulster Scots.

With this cultural tie gone, the case for a United ireland gets stronger.

3 - Brexit could be an economic disaster for the UK

This feeds into point 2, if the uk begins to falter without access to the single market the potential choice in a United Ireland referendum would be between a prosperous republic with access to the EU and a faltering uk, people tend to vote which way benefits their wallets

4 - Irish Passport

I am an Irish citizen so I retain my freedom of movement and right to work regardless of the outcome.

Now the substance of the issue.

&gt; EU had a flag, army, parliament, laws, currancy. All things that define a country.

None of those are the agreed determinative factors of being a country. If they were:

- Iceland, Panama and Costa Rica can't be countries (no standing army) but ISIS, the FARC and Beyonce could be (have armies);
- Ecuador, East Timor, El Salvador, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Togo, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and the Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines can't be countries (no own currency) but the IMF could be (uses SDR's);
- ISIS, ISIL, Al-Qaeda, Mujaheddin, PLO, Khalistani's and Fight Club could be countries (they have flags and/or laws); and
- Qatar, UAE, Kuwait, Brunei can't be countries (monarchies without independent parliaments),

also, the EU doesn't have an army NB: NATO is the EU's army) or, technically, a currency. The Euro-zone is separate from the EU.

&gt; Defined boarders, is Lithuania part of Russia? No. Its defined as part of eu not Russia. Can Lithuania leave eu? Yes, so can Scotland to UK. So your point is mute

Scotland cannot unilaterally choose to leave the UK. The PM has to first approve a referendum and then the referendum result is not decisive, it is merely suggestive. In contrast, any EU member can choose to leave the EU by sending the required notices. the notice is decisive of intent. None of he EU institutions can reject the Artilce 50 notice from an EU member. The UK can reject the equivalent notice from Scotland.

&gt; No sovergien authority? Yet EU law trumps all national law

It does not. Countries can choose to not apply EU law. They may get fined for doing so, but they absolutely don't have to. Moreover, it is always possible to (and the UK, Denmark and Poland always do) derogate from various parts of EU law they don't like. And this only applies to EU Regulations. EU Directives are nothing more than a statement of outcomes sought. Implementation, adjustments are all left to the individual EU countries.

It is important to note that ""EU Law"" is created by a process of taking the existing national law in all current member states and trying to determine an agreeable ""harmonsied"" minimum common denominator and that the powers of all the EU institutions are agreed on by the members from time to time in the treaties (most recently in 2009). There isn't some unchangable constitution that empower these bodies.

And another

&gt;If the Fascist ideology cannot be described as a simple response to Marxism, its origins, on the other hand, were the direct result of very specific revision of Marxism. It was a revision of Marxism and not a variety of Marxism or a consequence of Marxism…It was the French and Italian Sorelians, the theoreticians of revolutionary syndicalism who made this new and original revision of Marxism, and precisely this was their contribution to the birth of the Fascist ideology.

That does not mean they are not busy attempting to *control* the world's supply though.  Their new strategy (post anti-terror) has been called ""Great Power Competition"" where they want to isolate/weaken Russia and China.  [The Congressional Research Service released a paper on it.](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/R43838.pdf) (Sorry PDF).

They are now challenging the Chinese and the Russians at every turn.  From the doc:

&gt;""The shift to renewed great power competition was acknowledged alongside other considerations in the Obama Administration’s June 2015 National Military Strategy, and was placed at the center of the Trump Administration’s December 2017 National Security Strategy (NSS) and January 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS). The December 2017 NSS and January 2018 NDS formally reoriented U.S. national security strategy and U.S. defense strategy toward an explicit primary focus on great power competition with China and Russia.Department of Defense (DOD)officials have subsequently identified countering China’s military capabilities as DOD’s top priority.""

They are not lacking a strategy.  This is Wolfowitz's doctrine implemented.  They wish to control Russia's export of oil (note how they tried very hard to get the EU to drop Nord Stream 2?) and they patrol remote sea lanes and the Middle East because they still wish to *control* these places *including* the oil.

In response to this basic feature of world geography, U.S. policymakers for the last several decades have chosen to pursue, as a key element of U.S. national strategy, a goal of preventing the emergence of regional hegemons in Eurasia. Although U.S. policymakers do not often state explicitly in public the goal of preventing the emergence of regional hegemons in Eurasia, U.S. military operations in recent decades—both wartime operations and day-to-day operations—appear to have been carried out in no small part in support of this goal.""",True,False,False,,,0,1580572313,,1580573511,0,{},fg6n7hb,False,t3_evve6t,False,True,t1_fg3taht,/r/canada/comments/evve6t/aging_norad_warning_system_cant_detect_russian/fg6n7hb/,False,,1589062643,1,True,False,canada,t5_2qh68,r/canada,public,0,[],

There is a fear British farmers would either have to pressure the government to reduce our own regulations (which is bad) in order to compete, or just end up going out of business/getting bought by American corporations (which could arguably be even worse) - either way the average Brit is still stuck eating mostly bad food.

We could definitely get a trade deal with the EU. It is just that we have been trying to do that for ages now, and our government hasn't made much progress. The eventual trade deal we make with the EU isn't going to be lucrative as the one we had before (like I said earlier, the new deal with the EU is probably going to result in goods imported from the EU becoming more expensive than they are now) and we could be under pressure to make up the difference with a new trade deal, with a new partner (since we don't want our economy to shrink) - which has all of the possible negative outcomes listed above. 

And the USA has all the cards in this situation - we're the economy most at risk in this situation, not them. And the longer we go without a trade deal with the EU, the more hits our economy takes and the stronger the American position becomes.

Essentially, before Brexit, we were able to import relatively quality food from the EU pretty cheaply, and so that quality food could be sold for cheap within our borders. And because that food had to obey the same regulatory standards as our own food, plus pay for things like travel (despite their being no checks), it was easy for local produce to compete (since EU imported stuff would usually be slightly more expensive, just by virtue of being imported). And yet we still imported and sold tons of food from the EU, because it was cheap to import from there, and now that Brexit has happened we are either going to have to find a new source of 'cheap' imported goods or let all the businesses that were dependant on the EU (and the old EU prices) for that service flounder.

America, with their massive economy and international corporations, can easily provide those cheap goods. But we are a smaller power in need bargaining with a much bigger one, and so we don't have much leverage, and America has already made it clear that they are not going to increase their regulations to match our current health and safety standards. If we want to deal with them, they are saying, we're going to have to accept their food as it is, we're going to have to accept a whole bunch of other stuff, and there's even word that we're going to have to accept laws that make it harder to trace where food and other goods come from (so the consumer could be buying 'Prime British Beef!' thinking they're supporting the local economy, but the beef is actually imported from the US).

Essentially there is still going to be plenty of EU food in the stores after Brexit. The fear is that we're going to get a trade deal with the US that lets them flood our stores with cheaper, 'invisible' (since origin labelling will be banned), American food that neither British nor EU farmers could compete with (since British and EU farmers trying to sell food in the UK would still be growing their food according to the healthier, more humane, but more expensive regulations).",True,False,False,,,0,1580572980,,False,0,{},fg6o5ua,False,t3_ex21jt,False,False,t1_fg6d5rp,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/ex21jt/brexit_the_most_pointless_masochistic_ambition_in/fg6o5ua/,False,,1589063100,5,True,False,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,r/unitedkingdom,public,0,[],

Modern humans did not migrate out of Africa until around 70,000 years ago. Some humans who left Africa remained ""black,"" such as Australian Aborigines, who have been living there for at least 50,000 years.

Around 2 million years ago, some H erectus migrated out of Africa and spread out into Eurasia. By the time modern humans showed up, these people had evolved into other species of Homo: Neanderthals, Denisovans, and perhaps 2-3 others, yet undiscovered. When modern humans met these people, everybody got jiggy with everybody else, and modern human DNA contains as much as 4% Neanderthal DNA. Then the non-sapiens species died out, we don't know why.

As to the shallow traits we mistakenly call ""race,"" those are thought to develop almost overnight--in as little as 2500 years--in response to local environment, diet, and so on. Human races do not exist in biology, and grouping people by white/black/whatever does not produce any scientifically-meaningful groups.

Further, modern analysis of ancient human DNA shows that the old notion that people migrated out of Africa to some specific place (say, Asia or the Mideast) and then stayed put until modern times is wrong. People were bouncing around all over Eurasia all the time. So the notion that if you went back to Asia 20,000 years ago, people would look like modern Asians does not necessarily hold water.

Agreed - it would be easier to tax the rich (who can move wealth from country to country in seconds), if a country were part of some pan national organization with laws on Taxation....


&gt;work we can rejoin the EU

But never with the sweet heart deal that the UK had for so many years (and as was stated, goodbye pound, and entry into the Schengen region).

The blame will fall on the other party and the EU, because that's how politics works.

Jobs will move to Romania (Or China or to robots), since there is nothing any developed nation can do, other than to destroy wages entirely.

The real problem with muslims is less with Islam and more with Poverty+Fundamentalism. Eg, In Middle class Muslims, except for a very few people, ploygamy is looked down upon extremely.

Muslims are people, just like us, many share the same ideals of Liberty and freedom. But they wouldn't leave their culture in return for Europe. Because they shouldn't. If they are forced to, as I said, the ""cultural rights"" don't exist anymore.

Man, this feels like such a weird retroactive justification. Ostrogothic Italy, Visigothic Spain and even North Africa also have germanic pasts. The Vandals conquered what is now Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia and held it for about a century. But your germanic union doesn't include north africa, does it? And does it exclude Scotland, too?

&gt; They are all Protestant countries

I know *you're* specifically talking about the Nordics, but OP wasn't, so this doesn't really work. Speaking only for my own country, France is absolutely not protestant. According to Wikipedia it's 40 percent catholic, 2 percent protestant, and 20 percent atheist. And I'm betting the catholic numbers are exaggerated too because of people meaning their family background rather than practicing.

&gt; People really overstate the cultural diversity of Europe. For instance, there are more languages in individual countries in Asia and Oceania (and possibly Africa, but I'm not confident about that) then there are in the entirety of Europe.

Sure, but... people say Europe is culturally diverse **compared to America**. And even then, that's kind of a bad example, since India for instance has twice the population of the entire European union. Of course it has more languages. And a lot of them are similar or mutually intelligible. Number alone is not how you measure ""cultural diversity"".



Like overall I actually get your point. I've been to Denmark and found it very similar to the UK in terms of how manners work, what food they eat, etc. But then, if we put France on this list it's famous for being much colder than the others. 

Honestly stuff like that makes it so hard for me to take the rest of your comment at face value- the ""germanic"" thing is a nazi dogwhistle anyway (:c) so why even include this as a justification? How does both countries having germanic individuals in it 1500 years ago actually make us closer? Isn't there any other major events you can think of in the past millenium and a half that're more important than that? I can certainly think of some. And why bring up Germanic languages? English is a bastard language anyway and French isn't a Germanic language so you're clearly open to making exceptions?

I'd actually respect the point a lot more if you just said ""Because they're all wealthy nations, and I think it's more fair if we don't have to support impoverished regions that we have no political obligations to"" than to come up with weird pseudo-arguments to bolster things. The original poster made exceptions for countries that have Romance languages, and aren't Protestant, and aren't culturally similar to the others in the list, and drink wine instead of beer, but it's okay because they're rich, and we all know that's what you really mean, so why pollute your argument?

My Auntie is a small business owner. She voted leave due to the tariffs and constraints she feels the EU puts on her business when it comes to trade and business laws, and would like to be free to trade in a less rigid manner.

My Mum was unsure for a while and an example of a floating voter, but went for leave after feeling that the country shouldn't be dictated to by the EU anymore and we should get a greater say on our laws and regulations and systems. Her voting leave for me was an example of someone who shows that the leave campaign was effective in its job of getting people to support them, albeit through smearing, exaggerations and half truths.

My Grandad is of the generation that knows what happened back in the 1970s, when the country voted to join the EU. He voted to join the Union as he felt it would be better for our country. He ran a nationwide business, and is now retired, and has been for 16 years. He felt that the EU did more damage than harm in multiple facets (economically, business-wise and immigration), and would've preferred us to be back to the times where we weren't a part of it.

My Grandma....I'll just quote her....""I voted leave to kick the Muslims out of our country""....I don't need to explain that any further, only state that I condemn her islamaphobic views entirely and unequivocally.

What it shows is the facets of the leave voters. Some felt there was a future for them that was better for their lives and businesses outside of Europe, some felt disenfranchised in what they voted for 40 years ago, some were uncertain but just believed in the Leave campaign more than the Remain campaign (I should state, my Mum did go through a period of wishing she voted Remain instead of Leave) and some took the referendum as a chance to unleash pent up nationalist and racist ideologies in leaving the EU.

You brexiteers are radiating ignorance. Can't follow a basic Reddit comment chain.

&gt;You want to trample over distinct cultures and force foreign nations together in your federal fetish which will inevitably lead to bloodshed.

So you think I want to trample distinct cultures and I have a federal fetish. God forbid you have an IQ higher than my room temperature and ask yourself, why would this random guy over the Internet like a federation? Does he have a fetish? Or does he have legitimate arguments why a federation would be superior? You cannot go beyond your shitty nationalism to even ask those question because the moment something disagrees with your perception, you immediately call it with derogatory terms and use awful language like trample over cultures etc.

1. If you want to preserve cultures you need a strong country that could hold against outside influence, US with Hollywood already doing a good job of trampling the culture. If you have a strong country you subsequently have strong mechanisms to prevent other countries to destroy distinct cultures

2. The notion that you need a common culture to have a single country is incorrect. Many countries are multicultural, UK as well and many countries are multilingual, big (India, China) and small (Switzerland, Belgium)

3. Nothing will lead to bloodshed, the more interactions you make people have, the less likely you make them to have wars, EU already made a great progress in this area, a federal EU country would bring it on a whole new level

(Personal) I would be first to oppose the federalist movement if it meant the erosion of distinct cultures, I think distinct cultures make Europe great but I don't see a reason why all of these great cultures wouldn't be in a single country who would have much more power to protect those cultures. Federalism also is not something you fetishize about, it is something Europe needs if it is to survive in the world of big powers. US, China and India (soon), EU needs a similar structure to preserve it's interests in the world, if not for 1 European country, we will be the richest geopolitical battleground for those 3 big geopolitical powers, which could bring Europe once again to the new hostilities between us",True,False,True,,comment score below threshold,0,1580576351,,False,0,{},fg6t9ci,False,t3_ex59ho,False,True,t1_fg6r4xx,/r/europe/comments/ex59ho/eu_leaders_to_push_for_ever_closer_union_without/fg6t9ci/,False,,1589065546,-11,True,False,europe,t5_2qh4j,r/europe,public,0,[],

Children between 18 and 24 years of age consider anti-Semitic acts as a consequence of a widespread language based on hatred and racism with greater than average frequency: 67.6%, compared to values ​​around 60% in other age groups. Between 35 and 44 years of age there is the highest percentage of those who consider the anti-Semitic episodes that took place in Italy as stunts carried out by provocation or as a joke (41%); on the contrary, among the most mature, the lowest share was recorded (34.1%).

We have been together several years and we are raising a three years-old daughter together (four years in May).  We have been discussing marriage since we were seriously committed.

**In my opinion the courteous thing to do is to have two weddings, one in each country.  Not everybody has the means or the desire to travel to another country for a wedding.**

Many of our friends who are in international relationships share this opinion and practice.  Each wedding tends to be smaller, more personal, or less formal.  The most important question becomes one of formalities: In which country is the marriage legally registered?  Doing it in both countries is not necessarily a bad idea.  Obviously, registering the marriage where you intend to settle is a sensible idea.

My background: I am a naturalized UK citizen.  I moved here about 16 years ago from a non-EU country.  I am a dual citizen including the UK.  My previous serious relationship was with my girlfriend from the US.  We were planning to move to the US, marry, and settle there.  The fiance visa process took years.  Even though the visa application was successful by that time the relationship had fallen apart so I stayed in the UK.  I am also a marriage celebrant and have officiated at one wedding.

A long time ago I accepted that we would need to aspire to earn a good income if we wanted to afford to visit overseas relatives regularly.  Living an international life is not cheap.  When you add a child in the mix it become really tough.

Our families and friends are very supportive and they sometimes bend over backwards to make things financially easier for us.  **My aspiration is that our decision to maintain an international relationship and raise a child together should not impact our families and friends overseas.**",True,False,False,,,0,1580577443,,False,0,{},fg6uwvn,False,t3_ex5829,False,True,t3_ex5829,/r/weddingshaming/comments/ex5829/destination_weddings_are_selfish_except_when_its/fg6uwvn/,False,,1589066344,4,True,False,weddingshaming,t5_nhaha,r/weddingshaming,public,0,[],
