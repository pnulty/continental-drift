Think about how those countries are conduits for UK and US businesses to gain greater and greater wealth (and some are explicit tax havens).

I'm not sure what you're getting at by this.

I should add that Spaniards only ever made up a small percentage of the American populace during colonial times, with the majority being indigenous. And that while tactical intermarriage between elites happened as I described in that post, mixing was due more to rape and forced marriages in the conquest and early colonial periods; and to illicit relationships  (concubinage) during the colonial middle.

Is it common for Japanese women to use men for only English learning?

&gt; Dated this japanese girl I met at a party. We hit it off the first time we met, she was touchy and into me so then I asked her out. First date we had to reschedule so we met at a club for the second she was down to dance with me, I asked her if she was comfortable and liked it she said yes andi said if not she can tell me. Yet later in that night she dipped then blocked me on IG. 
&gt; 
&gt; Recently found her on tinder and says she’s looking for someone to teach her English as the bio lol. 
&gt; 
&gt; I’m wondering if maybe her whole intention was that and because I had no intention of being a teacher she ghosted me. I used to hang with more international japanese and noticed they were very keen on doing that to guys so is this just common?

&gt; For some reason I never experience this with Korean, Chinese or European internationals.

This explains literally nothing. You seem to think capitalism and sales are two interchangeable words they're not. Capitalism is an economic and political system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit, rather than by the state. If individuals didn't own any wealth or capitol there would be nothing to donate to charities.

You are aware that its the capitalist countries that give the most to charities universally right?

Not how CEO pay works. You don't understand what you are talking about so this is unsurprisingly a bad example.

Humanity isn't, and never was, all that predesposed towards monogamy.

Historically speaking, there have been a wide variety of cultures that handle family/romantic/child-rearing duties in ways other than a monogamous pair. That is a recent idea.


Historically in the west, for example, family units which included grandparents, aunts and uncles all lived on the same homestead and children were raised either by the direct family unit or collectively within the village.

Romantically speaking, in the west, true monogamous relationships hold a questionable majority. Prostitution is the oldest job in the world, that has survived every attempt to outlaw it. Everyone with political or economic power (from barons to Kings to merchants) used to keep mistresses - because for the overwhelming history of Christian Europe, marriages were transactional. People did not marry for pair ponding reasons. People married to consolidate land, power, and ensure family legacy via inheriting heirs. Marriage for the sake of maintaining a loving,.exclusive pair unit is historically very recent.


If you go past Christian history in Europe and look at Rome - monogamy was not the expected social practice for the overwhelming history of the Roman empire. Gay relationships were not frowned on so long as you were the ""top"" partner. I personally heavily dissaprove of.it, but Greek and Rome are known to have had an open mind/fandom for pedastry/gay relationships between male mentor and mentee, that had nothing to do with marriage.

And this doesn't even begin to touch on the Germanic tribe's (and several other European groups pre-christiandom) history with Polygamy.

There are a very wide number of historic cultures where polygamy were very much the norm, in the middle east, Africa and Asia, Greece and Rome - because women were viewed as chattel and you won their marriage in war.

The Bible literally includes polygamy and the marrying of the women of conquered enemy tribes in addition to keeping wives of your own. The Illiad and Oddesey mention polygamy as accepted practice by the warrior class as well. Historically, conquered women entering as a second or third wife is common.

Monogamy is *not* a historical truth for Western culture, much less world culture. Again, it's literally part of our formative Judeo-Christian texts.

[],,ILikeNeurons,1350619483.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_9cki6,False,True,[],"Well, regarding Main Point 1, I can say that [carbon pricing is widely regarded as the single most impactful climate mitigation policy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-019-0474-0.epdf?author_access_token=tst1A-oZnQ8zUO18wGGPQdRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0Nfy3PIgvrwnNXQzIbXH8z1Wkqhm6g5NiMnxMk__ebsKxGQNB0hMf1Vpo-ZiNplSt5LeLyks-Q3sdrpBdfxxHvAfQylqqwqHxgEml7GEGOxaQ%3D%3D), which is the opposite of a false solution. The IPCC states with [high confidence](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_summary-for-policymakers.pdf) that carbon taxes are effective, and you can see numerous examples (e.g. [here](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter15.pdf), [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069615000613), and [here](http://archive.economonitor.com/dolanecon/2013/07/08/why-progressives-should-love-a-carbon-tax-although-not-all-of-them-do/)) that [carbon taxes work](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/145038/1/cesifo1_wp6003.pdf). 

Regarding Main Point 2, I can agree that **low** carbon taxes are not as effective as **high** carbon taxes, but [they're not always low](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/31755/211435KeyFigures.pdf?sequence=5&amp;isAllowed=y), and if we want a higher carbon tax we need more political will, which [CCL volunteers create](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/about-ccl/). Fighting the policy is not a very good way to build political will for it. We know how to create political will, and [CCL offers free training](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/join-citizens-climate-lobby/?tfa_3590416195188=reddit-IAmA&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=IAmA) to volunteers willing to learn. 

Main Point 3 is not about carbon taxes. 

Regarding Main Point 4, while arguably true, is also arguably true of all technologies that claim lives (like cars, boats, trains, etc.) but as a society we have chosen to accept certain risks to gain certain benefits. The issue with fossil fuels is really that [the market is failing](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/10_Principles_of_Economics#Government_can_sometimes_improve_market_outcomes). 

Regarding Main Point 5, [the evidence suggests](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09644016.2018.1457287?journalCode=fenp20) racists are more likely to be climate deniers. I haven't seen evidence they are more likely to support carbon pricing.

It was their hatred of migrants and being overtaken that sparked the notion and then the narrative began to include and focus more on the fact that Europe is a “controlling force” and that Britain deserved to be “”free””.  The politicians and demographics that advocated it were &gt;are&lt; essentially harkening back to the glory days of an Empire that doesn’t exist anymore. 

Anyway. When it actually (for some inexplicable reason) started to become a reality we began to see just how detached a lot of Brits (not even just the Tories) were from reality and how clueless they were about the long-standing connection between our two countries. Because of their long-held grip over Ireland, Brexit was going to hit us hard and they didn’t even bother to care very much when we voiced our concerns over it. It was like they forgot they created this historic entanglement in the first place and they had the nerve to spend the last few years moaning about how much of a say the EU was giving us on the situation, considering the deep trade links and ties we have with them etc. Simply put. Jobs will be lost. A lot of our sectors will take a huge hit and the whole way through there hasn’t even been much curtesy and little acknowledgement of this economic interdependence, or how their decision would affect us. Brexit revived anti-Irish sentiment from their politicians and everyday people alike too. Time and time again, they threw Ireland under the bus for the delay of Brexit, particularly because of our concern with the Border and peace in Northern Ireland. Backstop became a dirty word in Westminster. They wanted it gone, even though it was there for a very good reason. For a long time it seemed as though they weren’t going to budge on something so vital for both English/Irish citizens in the North. It kinda felt that the Good Friday Agreement meant nothing to them. They treated the border like it was a small inconvenience that was in their way and not something that preserves a very delicate balance.

This is called an association fallacy. It's a typical cop-out of theism. 

&gt; Now think of the Worst 10 hellholes you'd never want to set foot in. Guaranteed 10/10 of them are Islamic or Communist-Atheist nations.

Islam and Christianity are practically the same religion, and western nations still struggle with the consequences of sexist, racism, homophobia, and patriarchal oppression no thanks to this (singular) cult. 

And communism is the language of religion without the gods. It's misinformation conveyed through shame, peer pressure, insinuations and appeals to emotion. Like any other snake oil. Which this is an example of. 

They even come from the same part if the world. Monotheism from the indo'european invasions outward from the Eurasian steeps, and communism from the same place, now south west Russia.

&gt; You have no idea how good you have it in countries with a strong Christian influence. 

Christian ideals are what brought slavery to America. We don't have freedom and democracy because of Christian ideals. You can thank a bunch of pagans, notable Plato, Aristotle and Socrates for that. 

&gt; Romans had certain taxes that specifically targeted widows and orphans (e.g., ""Aes Equestre"" and ""Aes Hordeariuma,"" taxes to maintain military horses).

Which makes all pagans bad? What a cheery picked excuse. 

&gt; So get out of here with the ""thousands of years of disparity and oppression"" nonsense. You have no idea what you're talking about

Leviticus 20:13 

‘If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be **put to death;** their blood will be on their own heads.

Just one example of oppression directly from the Bible. Lgbt were executed for hundreds if years because if the Bible. The Bible is why women couldn't own property or get a job. Taxing single women would be rediculous in a Christian state since they weren't allowed to own in the first place. And Christians are undoubtedly responsible for crusades, conquests and colonialism, which resulted in the genocides of millions. 

You're the one that's ignorant if the history of your own religion. Or even of the values of western society. Hell if you could even cite one you might learn better. But that's not how a theist reasons, is it. By supporting their claims with facts. Instead you rely on fallacies and qualifiers and obvious non specific bullshit. Christianity is responsible for a dark ages, hundreds of years of lost literacy and technology, and has poised itself as an obstacle to science and progress for even longer. Without Christianity we would certainly be better off. After all, it was the pagan religions and not Christianity that lead up to western values.

As a power move britain's prime minister calls out a referendum to the question ""should Britain remain in the eu"". He didn't expect it to actually be won by ""leave"", but of course as you know it won. He resigns so as to not deal with the mess. 

The leave campaign is rooted mostly in two issues: Immigration and regulation. Right Winged politicians claim (lying with all their teeth) that the European Union forces the Uk to give more money than they get back to Europe. One of the most striking images is the lie that Boris Johnson has about ""350 million pounds a week to the EU will now go to the NHS"" (national healthcare service). He later admitted that was total bogus by the way and as current prime minister he has actually slashed the NHS. I digress.

The other issue is Immigration. Under EU rules any citizen of any of the 28 members  can freely travel. It's feasible to go from Lisbon to Finland, and cross every country in its path with just your id without ever seeing border patrol. As an Island the British enjoyed a bit more autonomy in that they kept their borders patrolled and had more of a say in who could cross but even so a lot of british people felt that, in particular, Portugal gave citizenship to people from former colonies and those people didn't stay in Portugal and came to the Uk, where they - well it's pretty much the same as mexicans are claimed to do in the US. They ""took their jobs"".

So really though it's vastly more complex than that (and why it has been negotiated so very much) those are the main reasons ""close our borders"" and ""Don't give more money to Europe"" (as a note, economists estimate that EU economical benefits actually helped the British Economy - especially in terms of corporations.

A new coronavirus, designated 2019-nCoV, was identified in late 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, after people developed pneumonia without a clear cause and for which existing treatments were not effective. The virus can spread between people, and its transmission rate (rate of infection) appeared to increase in mid-January 2020. Several countries across Europe, North America and the Asia-Pacific have reported cases. The time from exposure to the development of symptoms is between two and 14 days and there is tentative evidence that it may be  contagious before the onset of symptoms.

Current estimates for the cost of Brexit run around £130billion. Projected to be more like £200billion by the time Brexit actually happens. True, these are estimates, but by all accounts so far they're at least ballpark-accurate. Another more conservative estimate has it as more like £100billion to-date. 

Total cost of all payments to the EU since 1974? £215 billion, adjusted for inflation. 

If payments to the EU were just a one-way street, then things might not seem so stupid. At worst, we would be losing -slightly- less than what we paid in 40 years. 

However, those payments aren't actually one-way. We receive a big ol' fuckton of money back from the EU through various projects. For example, there are around ~30 projects in Cornwall alone, that have been funded by EU grants, some of them in the scale of £300million to £400million. These projects will now no longer exist, as the funding isn't available. 

Unless you think the Tories are going to start funding these things? Like they said they would fund the NHS? Sorry, they're not doing that either. 

So our actual NET expenditure for being a member of the EU ends up being significantly less than the £215billion then. So all the people who voted because they were told that ""All their tax money was going to Europe and being spent on ...immigrants, or something"" were, at best, misinformed. (Lied to, lets be honest here, the whole campaign was a pack of lies. It's been proven, multiple times.)

So what do we GET from leaving the EU? What's the actual benefit? 

More money? Not really. We don't have to spend anything on Europe anymore, but that also means we no longer get all the trade benefits etc etc etc that we used to get, so at best we will be no better off than before, and at worst the UK will have to spend large sums of additional money just to end up with a similar trade situation. Net loss. Unless you think that the UK is such a 'strong economic power' that the world will be bending over backwards to give us favourable trade deals? In which case, you're delusional. 

The ability to set our own laws? We already could. The ability to fight against EU laws and parliament? We already did that too. Now we can't. 

Oh, here's a big one. Immigration. We can close our borders to those filthy immigrants, coming and taking all our jobs. Right? Right? Nope. Large numbers of those immigrants weren't even from the EU anyway, so nothing will change there. And any trade deals with the EU (which we need, see previous points) will require the UK agreeing to certain border agreements, because that's how the EU works and that's already been stated in all the EU deals that have been offered. So... yup, absolutely not changes to immigration either. 

So what do we get? Nothing much. Parliament gets to make the UK a tax haven, so rich people (oh look, the people in government and the media who lobbied for Brexit in the first place, remember those guys?) can keep their money tax free, while simultaneously increasing taxes for the people who can't afford it. And... that's about it, really. And what does it cost us? 

Somewhere in the region of £500million a week in lost growth.

EDIT: Wow, there are so many misconceptions here about the tipping system in the US, and from Americans, too.  I mentioned this in a reply below, but I'll say it again here.  Many states only require that tipped employees be paid 2.13 an hour.  Some states are $2.50.  Some have the same minimum wage for tipped and non-tipped employees (the lucky ones).  Employers are not ever responsible for paying more than the state minimum wage for tipped employees.  If you don't make the state minimum wage for non-tipped employees on your shift, you're SOL.  However, servers are required to report 10% of their total sales as tipped income, regardless of how much they actually received.  If you don't claim 10% after each shift, you will end up with allocated tips when you file taxes at the end of the year, and the IRS will force you to pay taxes on it.  Working in a state that paid 2.13 to servers, my paychecks from the restaurant were for $0, after taxes.

Yes, the system sucks big time.  I actually noticed that I received much better service in European restaurants because this ridiculous system isn't used.

I'd highly suggest going with one that covers anything medical related and can cover if your baggage goes missing or if flights get cancelled. I've never had it happen to me but the only insurance I swear by is travel insurance. They often have international numbers you can call as well if something happens on matter where you are. They usually have deals with airlines and direct contacts so you can avoid having those conversations. A travel agent would just be an extra person to call and a bit more money.

Places like STA prey on young and clueless travellers mainly because they're trying to test out their independence for the first time and it's like a stepping stone between that and using your own autonomy. You'd be surprised that there is a weird joy to planning out your own trip and just being as careful as you go. Making budgets, making lists and just being aware that doing your own bookings pose the same risks as if going through a travel agent.

Just remember at the end of the day with everyone you're dealing with that you're adults, you're human and you probably speak the same language.

Is the EU really undemocratic?

Unlike the United Nations or the World Trade Organisation, only democracies can join the European Union. In theory, EU member states that slide back on democratic standards can be sanctioned, although this is easier said than done.

But aren’t a bunch of unelected bureaucrats in charge?

Actually, they aren’t. When people talk about “the unelected bureaucrats of Brussels”, they usually mean the European commission. The commission is an organisation like no other: more than a civil service but less than a government. Composed of 28 commissioners – one from each country – the commission drafts, enforces and monitors EU laws. But it does not pass laws.

That does not mean the commission is not powerful: the EU competition commissioner can block mergers and fine multinational companies staggering sums computer chip maker Intel was fined a record €1.06bn (then £852m) for anti-competitive practices. But these powers rest on treaties and laws decided by EU governments. Similarly when it comes to striking trade agreements, the commission’s powers are restricted. The EU trade commissioner negotiates on a mandate drawn up by EU member states – the opening of controversial TTIP talks with the US was based on a unanimous decision by EU member states. If TTIP survives, it can only enter into force with the approval of governments and the European parliament.

The commission cannot foist laws upon EU member states. For example, the commission spent eight years trying to get EU countries to agree to a law on cleaning up Europe’s contaminated soils, but eventually withdrew the bill in the face of an immovable blocking majority, which included the UK.

One of the biggest gripes of Eurosceptics is the extension of qualified-majority voting, which allows the British government to be outvoted. A swathe of EU policies are now decided by these weighted-majority votes, such as environment, agriculture and transport. More sensitive policies, including tax, defence and foreign policy, have to be agreed by unanimity.

Under QMV, a law passes if it is backed by 16 out of 28 countries that make up at least 65% of the EU population. The UK has 13% of the EU population, so gets a 13% vote share.

Research by the London School of Economics found that the UK was on the winning side 87% of the time between 2009-15. So the British government does have to accept some EU decisions it didn’t vote for. One of the most high-profile losses in recent years, was when the chancellor, George Osborne, was outvoted on an EU law to restrict bankers bonuses. In this case, more than three quarters of the British public, including 68% of Conservative voters, supported the EU proposal.

National parliaments can also throw a spanner in the works if they don’t like an EU law. If one third of national parliaments oppose a draft law, the commission must review it, a procedure known as the yellow card. If more than half of national parliaments oppose a law, this could force a vote in the European parliament or council, (the orange card). In his February reform deal, the prime minister, David Cameron, persuaded EU leaders to introduce a red card, meaning the commission would be forced to adapt or drop the law if more than half of national parliaments objected. The yellow card has only been used twice, the orange card has never been used and the red card will only come into force if the UK votes to remain in the EU.",False,False,False,,,0,1580541376,,False,0,{},fg5w4wt,False,t3_ewwlpz,False,False,t1_fg5o9gb,/r/worldnews/comments/ewwlpz/the_united_kingdom_exits_the_european_union/fg5w4wt/,False,,1589049696,21,True,False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,r/worldnews,public,0,[],

But tariff trading is obviously fundamentally against the concept of the inner market as I'm sure you know, and the UK currently has made a brexit deal which keeps them as a member of the inner market and under the regulations put in place by the EU

The EU trades plenty with other countries outside the Schengen area, but in that case it of course includes tariffs. I must admit that I don't actually know if the Schengen was a specific requirement for the EU to allow Switzerland into the inner market, or if this was a mutual agreement, and Switzerland wanted to be part of the Schengen area. The schengen agreement do offer some advantages when it comes to trading, since it naturally makes trading between European nations faster and with less bureaucracy, oversight and border control.

Turkey isn't a member of the single market and never was. The only non-eu members part of the inner market so far is Norway and Switzerland. I do not know the specifics of the current EU-Turkish trade-agreement, but tariffs are very much in effect at the moment.

And yes regulations apply domestically for all members of the single market. The point the EU claims to be of the inner market when it comes to trade-deal negotiations is to have a uniform point of reference on what type and quality of goods the nations outside of EU can expect to buy and sell, and the point of restriction of independent trade-deals is the idea that the EU making deals collectively increases it's bargain power as the collective market is bigger and more powerful.

Storbritanniens EU-utträde innebär ett nytt kapitel i EU:s historia och dagens anföranden syftar till att blicka framåt mot de specifika inre och yttre utmaningar som måste hanteras under de kommande åren, och reflektera över hur man från EU:s håll ska bli bättre på att involvera medborgarna, civilsamhället och de nationella parlamenten i debatterna och beslutsfattandet som kommer att forma Europas framtid.

In reality, however, politics will determine this. The EU is actively courting the Scots regardless of the legal situation.

Strictly speaking the Scots are helpless captives of Westminster, but if the Scottish people are unified and determined to split from Downing St and return to the EU, who is to stop them? 

Even the Peter Pan of clowns isn't silly enough to start a Scottish war. They are a stubborn and stoic people; even the Romans couldn't subdue the Scots.

Another legal hurdle is that all EU States must agree to accept new member states. Theoretically, Scotland could go through the drama of leaving the UK, only to have Transylvania veto their re-entry to the EU.

Politics should and will determine the outcome of this. It's good to have rules but international diplomacy should not be defined by black letter legal niceties.

If a nation has a clear direction and purpose, and what they want to do will benefit peace and prosperity, I don't see that being prevented just because it isn't in the By-laws.

There's no precedent for this. It's going to be a fascinating thing to watch. Essentially the UK is the last remnant of the British Empire. Ireland Scotland and Wales have been loyal and constructive members, but they are colonies, conquered by force.

The distinction tends to be that Existentialism emphasizes individuals determining their own meaning in a world where there seems to lack any objective meaning or teleology. Absurdism is recognizing life, altogether, id ultimately meaningless, yet to keep going anyway. Some have critiqued it as just a more pessimistic existentialism, with Camus asserting value in rebelling against the Absurd. 

Honestly, I’d say some of the best examples for Existentialism are Kierkegaard (Either/Or is probably his best work) and, maybe, Heidegger (though he is notoriously hard to read; an introductory book will suffice).

Really, the Federation is no different from the EU -- but at a different scale. Sure, humanity has put aside its war and united under a common rule of law, and has likewise united with other species. 

But what still happens afterwards? Conflict with Klingons, Romulans, Cardassians, Borg, the Dominion, ec. Hell, humans still have conflicts with ourselves (e.g., Maquis).

Gene Roddenberry is not a prophet who's provided us with a holy text that unlocks how we should perceive Star Trek.

No, we all have critical minds, and we should exercise them sufficiently. For this reason, I examine the actual story, not St. Gene &amp; Co.'s interpretation of the story.

&gt; The point is that overall humanity will evolve to something better, despite problems and issues arising.

What actual evidence is there that humanity has evolved? On the contrary, what the actual *stories* of Star Trek tell us is that humanity has not changed. [Quark said it best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D2SHNqkjbY).

There are many accepted definitions, all closely interrelated.

A inversão de valores amplifica a voz da orgulhosa mulher de bandido que tem movimentação financeira imensa e sem justificativa, não quer fazer biometria e a digital na identidade está falsificada


Esta mulher está acima da sua convivência e conivência com o bandido, a mulher que comentou sobre isso, a curta e grossa, recebeu ataques machistas e racistas por ser branca. Chegaram a dizer que só bastava chamar de branca para desmerece-la

Sério

Ser negro não serve de nada quando uma multidão se une para derrubar você por motivos imbecil, apenas dirão que quero usar a cor da minha pele para não sofrer o justo castigo de ser uma pessoa de merda, pelos critérios lá deles, enquanto que a verdade dos fatos que o banco Itaú apresentou desde o primeiro segundo da notícia não vale de nada quando resolvem exaltar a narrativa de que somos um país racista mesmo que sejamos o mais miscigenado que jamais conheci.

O que torna negros criveis? O que faz com que pessoas brancas se sintam no poder de me chamar de portadora de vagina, me proibir de me chamar de mulher biológica e me escorraçar de diversos lugares e aceitar a palavra da mulher do dj dos bandidos?

Para acabar com o racismo criaram um conceito racista que pune vozes dissonantes negras e premia vozes alinhadas.

Obviamente, reforça o racismo.

Por fim, convêm também adicionar notas em passagens que tratam dalguns acontecimentos históricos, pois como que o autor o escreveu em 1922, este assume que o leitor àquela época teria bastante conhecimento do cenário pelo qual passava a Europa após a Grande Guerra, mas como que já se passaram quase cem anos até então, não são todos que conhecem a respeito de bolchevismo, do expansionismo da União Soviética pelo leste europeu e da Guerra Húngaro-Romena de 1919.

And yes: There are ""jumps"" in numbers every time you hit ""update""...

The virus has shown evidence of human-to-human transmission, and its rate of infection appeared to increase in mid-January 2020, with several countries across Europe, North America and the Asia-Pacific reporting cases. The incubation period is between 2 and 10 days. There is evidence that it can be contagious before the onset of symptoms.

I have no idea, I don’t run the country or the EU Commission. Nothing to say you couldn’t leave the UK the day before you join the EU, there’s a million ways to do it and it’s a fundamentally unique situation given we’ve already been in the EU (and the EU seems to be _very openly_ welcoming us back in).

We don’t have to take on any of the UK national debt, although we likely would as part of a trade/free movement deal with England. Even then it would be negotiable and this phobia of debt is a holdover from the financial crisis which wasn’t caused in any way, shape or form by debts in public finances. We may need to borrow for a while to make up the shortfall, big deal.

#WRONG. 

The framers of the Constitution knew full well that abuse of power was an impeachable offense..

&gt;Alan Dershowitz, has insisted that the Constitution’s “high crimes and misdemeanors” include only crimes found in the statute books, not abuse of power.

&gt;That’s obviously wrong. In 1725, in a case the framers knew, Thomas, Earl of Macclesfield, was impeached by the British House of Commons specifically for “Abuse of his Power” and “great Abuse of his Authority.” The House of Lords convicted him for it.

&gt;At the constitutional convention, on July 20, 1787, Edmund Randolph, the governor of Virginia who had introduced the Virginia plan, stated specifically that “the propriety of impeachments was a favorite principle with him” because “the Executive will have great opportunitys of abusing his power.”

&gt;In Federalist 65, Alexander Hamilton defined “high crimes and misdemeanors” as “those offenses which proceed 
from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust.”

Yuri Lutsenko, Ukraine’s prosecutor general said he told Giuliani that he would be happy to cooperate if the FBI or other U.S. authorities began their own investigation of the former vice president and his son Hunter but insisted they had not broken any Ukrainian laws to his knowledge.

**“I said, ‘Let’s put this through prosecutors, not through presidents,’ ” [Lutsenko told The Times.](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2019-09-29/former-ukraine-prosecutor-says-no-wrongdoing-biden) ""I told him I could not start an investigation just for the interests of an American official,” he said.**

#WRONG.

They started investigating **Burisma Holdings** for corruption prior to Hunter being on the board. They were not investigating Biden directly. 

Daria Kaleniuk, executive director of Ukraine's Anti-Corruption Action Center, told The Washington Post for a July article that Corrupt Ukraine Inspector General Viktor Shokin ""**was not investigating. He didn't want to investigate Burisma. And Shokin was fired not because he wanted to do that investigation, but quite to the contrary, because he failed that investigation.""
**
&gt;His mind is gone the only reason his handlers are forcing him to run is to cover up massive corruption

Not sure what you're trying to say here. Can you clarify your statement in English? 

The State Department claimed in 2014 that there was no conflict of interest with Hunter being on the board, noting Biden was a “private citizen.”

Shokin was widely seen -- by Ukrainian activists, US diplomats, European governments and the International Monetary Fund --[ as ineffective or corrupt.](https://www.ft.com/content/e1454ace-e61b-11e9-9743-db5a370481bc) In a speech in 2015, Geoffrey Pyatt, then the US ambassador to Ukraine, castigated Shokin's office for impeding the investigation of Burisma's owner Zlochevsky. [Pyatt called for people in Shokin's office to be fired, ""at minimum.""](https://voxukraine.org/en/remarks-by-us-ambassador-geoffrey-pyatt-at-the-odesa-financial-forum/)
""Rather than supporting Ukraine's reforms and working to root out corruption, corrupt actors within the prosecutor general's office are making things worse by openly and aggressively undermining reform,"" Pyatt said.

 [**Biden was acting in accordance with official US policy.**](https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/23/politics/fact-check-trump-ukraine-hunter-biden-joe-biden/index.html) 

Because of Shokin's reputation, the US and its allies believed that removing him would increase, not decrease, the chances of people like Zlochevsky being pursued.
[""What former Vice President Biden requested of former President of Ukraine, \(Petro\) Poroshenko, was the removal of a corrupt prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin,""](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2019/nov/12/who-george-kent/) George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, testified in the impeachment inquiry. Kent went on to say Shokin had ""undermined"" a US-funded program to try to investigate corrupt Ukrainian prosecutors.

What happened today, according to Salvini, ""is an important day for democracy, for Europe it remains to be seen. I have no prejudices, neither for nor against it""

&amp;#x200B;

Now some further considerations on italian politics, Europe and some international stances (I can't really find many articles in english so if you don't know italian you'll have to trust me, I didn't want to talk about stuff with no sources)

[Back in 2016 his opinion was quite different](https://twitter.com/matteosalvinimi/status/746422505892544514) (FREE! Now it's our turn!) as he praised the Brexit referendum and hoped something similar would happen in Italy and the other populist party (M5S) was for a referendum on the Euro, but when M5S has been in power in the last couple of years (both in the previous League+M5S and in the current PD+M5S government) they didn't talk about it and the **M5S appointed president has good relations with most European leaders and the EU** and [he feels very comfortable with the Euro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDhP6TIJpE&amp;t=1m10s), he sees it as the currency of his grandchildrens

(*for the ones who don't know recent italian politics from June 2018 to August 2019 there was a government lead by Giuseppe Conte supported by Lega (far-right anti-immigration eurosceptics) and M5S (anti-establishment populists, some say left-wing). Since September 2019 there's a new government supported by M5S and PD (center-left) but lead by the same president*)

&amp;#x200B;

While Salvini changed his view to ""let's improve the EU from the inside"" and it seems like he's trying to avoid the discussion about Itexit or whatever lately, I'm not really sure his supporters agree, at least judging by the comments on socials

In the past he also made a distinction between the EU and the Euro as a currency and in a [recent interview](https://www.ilfoglio.it/politica/2019/10/15/video/salvini-manda-in-crisi-borghi-e-bagnai-sull-italexit-280631/) he said that **Italy abandoning Euro on its own wouldn't make any sense** but if there will be discussions about changes in the EU monetary policy in the future he will be available, after in a [previous interview](https://www.ilfoglio.it/politica/2019/10/14/news/prove-di-salvini-2-0-280232/) **he said that Euro is irreversible** and he didn't want to get rid of it. He **corrected it by saying that the only irreversible thing in this world is death**, and he still thinks that the Euro didn't help Italy's economy at all so far, but that's what Italy is using so they have to work with what they have now

It seems like he's moving to slightly more moderate positions on the subject for now, although some sceptics may remember that the League plan to get rid of the Euro was to do it undercover, not talking about it, and then getting rid of it in the weekend or whatever when the stock market, banks or whatever are closed, although I don't think they would really be that crazy, and considering how much it took the UK to just leave the EU I don't think that Italy could get rid of the Euro overnight

&amp;#x200B;

The **other italian nationalist far-right party FDI** (Brothers of Italy, I know it may sound silly to non-italians but it's a phrase taken from the italian national anthem, it's probably meant to be patriotic) has **grown a lot last year** (from 3% to 11% in the polls, confirmed by the 9-10% they took in the last regional elections) and according to multiple [italian newspapers](https://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/times-giorgia-meloni-i-20-personaggi-che-potrebbero-plasmare-mondo-ACXoWT9) its leader (Giorgia Meloni) is considered one of the 20 people who may change the world in 2020 by the Times (I can't see the Times article as it seems like it's behind a paywall but some major italian newspapers covered the news so I don't think it's fake news or something). Changing the world is exaggerated imo, but **she will likely be quite important in italian politics from now on**

I'm not really sure about their exact stance on the EU, FDI is a eurosceptic party and they keep attacking EU institutions and stuff, but I don't know if they talked about Itexit or similar stuff. They're currently in the ECR group (European Conservatives and Reformists), which is about reforming the EU rather than abandoning it

It seems like she's favored among american conservatives as a key far-right figure in Italy as she [participated to the CPAC 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QgpqCfBg2E) (Conservative Political Action Conference) in the USA and she will be at the CPAC 2020 as well, and she will also attend a meeting in Washington Trump will take part in next week, while Salvini was not invited. According to [some articles](https://rep.repubblica.it/pwa/generale/2019/11/27/news/fdi_meloni_va_alla_casa_bianca_trump_punta_su_giorgia_e_salvini_ora_la_teme-242074556/) **Salvini is not favored by American conservatives due to its pro-Putin positions** and also due to a scandal about Lega receiving funds from Russians

&amp;#x200B;

In my personal opinion I think that FDI could potentially take the place of Lega as the main far-right italian nationalist party in the long run, either because it will keep growing or because Lega will rethink some of their extreme positions. An advantage of FDI is that it was born as a nationalist party from the ground up while Lega was born as an anti-South North-independence party and just recently became an italian nationalist party, so lots of people in the South still don't trust them (Salvini himself was recorded singing a known north italian stadium chant against people from Naples in 2009).

I have always recognised the benefits of being part of the EU,  however I do not believe in centralisation of power. Being from just outside Belfast I cannot see how a foreign government can effectively legislate for many diverse regions.

My vote came from a few points,

1 - distrust of politicians

I knew that there would be little to no truth in the campaigns or if there was it would be so swallowed in the mire that you wouldn’t be able to recognise it.

Because of this I chose to base my vote on the question to myself “am I a hypocrite?” 

Due to my dislike of centralisation of power I have always been Bock of my dislike of the EU, so I voted the way of my previous complaints

2 - Irish nationalism

With the current status quo and relatively stable political situation in the north of Ireland I know that no one would really chose a United ireland - grand political ideals are just that, they aren’t worth risking peace and stability (particularly in a place that has suffered so much)

My theory was that if the leave vote would be successful, all that binds Scotland to the union would be eroded and the would leave the UK. This hasn’t happened yet but it is clearly on the cards for the future.

If Scotland leave the UK then there is no longer a cultural tie with the UK from the north, after all the unionists mostly see themselves as Ulster Scots.

With this cultural tie gone, the case for a United ireland gets stronger.

3 - Brexit could be an economic disaster for the UK

This feeds into point 2, if the uk begins to falter without access to the single market the potential choice in a United Ireland referendum would be between a prosperous republic with access to the EU and a faltering uk, people tend to vote which way benefits their wallets

4 - Irish Passport

I am an Irish citizen so I retain my freedom of movement and right to work regardless of the outcome.

Now the substance of the issue.

&gt; EU had a flag, army, parliament, laws, currancy. All things that define a country.

None of those are the agreed determinative factors of being a country. If they were:

- Iceland, Panama and Costa Rica can't be countries (no standing army) but ISIS, the FARC and Beyonce could be (have armies);
- Ecuador, East Timor, El Salvador, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Togo, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and the Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines can't be countries (no own currency) but the IMF could be (uses SDR's);
- ISIS, ISIL, Al-Qaeda, Mujaheddin, PLO, Khalistani's and Fight Club could be countries (they have flags and/or laws); and
- Qatar, UAE, Kuwait, Brunei can't be countries (monarchies without independent parliaments),

also, the EU doesn't have an army NB: NATO is the EU's army) or, technically, a currency. The Euro-zone is separate from the EU.

&gt; Defined boarders, is Lithuania part of Russia? No. Its defined as part of eu not Russia. Can Lithuania leave eu? Yes, so can Scotland to UK. So your point is mute

Scotland cannot unilaterally choose to leave the UK. The PM has to first approve a referendum and then the referendum result is not decisive, it is merely suggestive. In contrast, any EU member can choose to leave the EU by sending the required notices. the notice is decisive of intent. None of he EU institutions can reject the Artilce 50 notice from an EU member. The UK can reject the equivalent notice from Scotland.

&gt; No sovergien authority? Yet EU law trumps all national law

It does not. Countries can choose to not apply EU law. They may get fined for doing so, but they absolutely don't have to. Moreover, it is always possible to (and the UK, Denmark and Poland always do) derogate from various parts of EU law they don't like. And this only applies to EU Regulations. EU Directives are nothing more than a statement of outcomes sought. Implementation, adjustments are all left to the individual EU countries.

It is important to note that ""EU Law"" is created by a process of taking the existing national law in all current member states and trying to determine an agreeable ""harmonsied"" minimum common denominator and that the powers of all the EU institutions are agreed on by the members from time to time in the treaties (most recently in 2009). There isn't some unchangable constitution that empower these bodies.

And another

&gt;If the Fascist ideology cannot be described as a simple response to Marxism, its origins, on the other hand, were the direct result of very specific revision of Marxism. It was a revision of Marxism and not a variety of Marxism or a consequence of Marxism…It was the French and Italian Sorelians, the theoreticians of revolutionary syndicalism who made this new and original revision of Marxism, and precisely this was their contribution to the birth of the Fascist ideology.

That does not mean they are not busy attempting to *control* the world's supply though.  Their new strategy (post anti-terror) has been called ""Great Power Competition"" where they want to isolate/weaken Russia and China.  [The Congressional Research Service released a paper on it.](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/R43838.pdf) (Sorry PDF).

They are now challenging the Chinese and the Russians at every turn.  From the doc:

&gt;""The shift to renewed great power competition was acknowledged alongside other considerations in the Obama Administration’s June 2015 National Military Strategy, and was placed at the center of the Trump Administration’s December 2017 National Security Strategy (NSS) and January 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS). The December 2017 NSS and January 2018 NDS formally reoriented U.S. national security strategy and U.S. defense strategy toward an explicit primary focus on great power competition with China and Russia.Department of Defense (DOD)officials have subsequently identified countering China’s military capabilities as DOD’s top priority.""

They are not lacking a strategy.  This is Wolfowitz's doctrine implemented.  They wish to control Russia's export of oil (note how they tried very hard to get the EU to drop Nord Stream 2?) and they patrol remote sea lanes and the Middle East because they still wish to *control* these places *including* the oil.

In response to this basic feature of world geography, U.S. policymakers for the last several decades have chosen to pursue, as a key element of U.S. national strategy, a goal of preventing the emergence of regional hegemons in Eurasia. Although U.S. policymakers do not often state explicitly in public the goal of preventing the emergence of regional hegemons in Eurasia, U.S. military operations in recent decades—both wartime operations and day-to-day operations—appear to have been carried out in no small part in support of this goal.""",True,False,False,,,0,1580572313,,1580573511,0,{},fg6n7hb,False,t3_evve6t,False,True,t1_fg3taht,/r/canada/comments/evve6t/aging_norad_warning_system_cant_detect_russian/fg6n7hb/,False,,1589062643,1,True,False,canada,t5_2qh68,r/canada,public,0,[],

There is a fear British farmers would either have to pressure the government to reduce our own regulations (which is bad) in order to compete, or just end up going out of business/getting bought by American corporations (which could arguably be even worse) - either way the average Brit is still stuck eating mostly bad food.

We could definitely get a trade deal with the EU. It is just that we have been trying to do that for ages now, and our government hasn't made much progress. The eventual trade deal we make with the EU isn't going to be lucrative as the one we had before (like I said earlier, the new deal with the EU is probably going to result in goods imported from the EU becoming more expensive than they are now) and we could be under pressure to make up the difference with a new trade deal, with a new partner (since we don't want our economy to shrink) - which has all of the possible negative outcomes listed above. 

And the USA has all the cards in this situation - we're the economy most at risk in this situation, not them. And the longer we go without a trade deal with the EU, the more hits our economy takes and the stronger the American position becomes.

Essentially, before Brexit, we were able to import relatively quality food from the EU pretty cheaply, and so that quality food could be sold for cheap within our borders. And because that food had to obey the same regulatory standards as our own food, plus pay for things like travel (despite their being no checks), it was easy for local produce to compete (since EU imported stuff would usually be slightly more expensive, just by virtue of being imported). And yet we still imported and sold tons of food from the EU, because it was cheap to import from there, and now that Brexit has happened we are either going to have to find a new source of 'cheap' imported goods or let all the businesses that were dependant on the EU (and the old EU prices) for that service flounder.

America, with their massive economy and international corporations, can easily provide those cheap goods. But we are a smaller power in need bargaining with a much bigger one, and so we don't have much leverage, and America has already made it clear that they are not going to increase their regulations to match our current health and safety standards. If we want to deal with them, they are saying, we're going to have to accept their food as it is, we're going to have to accept a whole bunch of other stuff, and there's even word that we're going to have to accept laws that make it harder to trace where food and other goods come from (so the consumer could be buying 'Prime British Beef!' thinking they're supporting the local economy, but the beef is actually imported from the US).

Essentially there is still going to be plenty of EU food in the stores after Brexit. The fear is that we're going to get a trade deal with the US that lets them flood our stores with cheaper, 'invisible' (since origin labelling will be banned), American food that neither British nor EU farmers could compete with (since British and EU farmers trying to sell food in the UK would still be growing their food according to the healthier, more humane, but more expensive regulations).",True,False,False,,,0,1580572980,,False,0,{},fg6o5ua,False,t3_ex21jt,False,False,t1_fg6d5rp,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/ex21jt/brexit_the_most_pointless_masochistic_ambition_in/fg6o5ua/,False,,1589063100,5,True,False,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,r/unitedkingdom,public,0,[],

Modern humans did not migrate out of Africa until around 70,000 years ago. Some humans who left Africa remained ""black,"" such as Australian Aborigines, who have been living there for at least 50,000 years.

Around 2 million years ago, some H erectus migrated out of Africa and spread out into Eurasia. By the time modern humans showed up, these people had evolved into other species of Homo: Neanderthals, Denisovans, and perhaps 2-3 others, yet undiscovered. When modern humans met these people, everybody got jiggy with everybody else, and modern human DNA contains as much as 4% Neanderthal DNA. Then the non-sapiens species died out, we don't know why.

As to the shallow traits we mistakenly call ""race,"" those are thought to develop almost overnight--in as little as 2500 years--in response to local environment, diet, and so on. Human races do not exist in biology, and grouping people by white/black/whatever does not produce any scientifically-meaningful groups.

Further, modern analysis of ancient human DNA shows that the old notion that people migrated out of Africa to some specific place (say, Asia or the Mideast) and then stayed put until modern times is wrong. People were bouncing around all over Eurasia all the time. So the notion that if you went back to Asia 20,000 years ago, people would look like modern Asians does not necessarily hold water.

Agreed - it would be easier to tax the rich (who can move wealth from country to country in seconds), if a country were part of some pan national organization with laws on Taxation....


&gt;work we can rejoin the EU

But never with the sweet heart deal that the UK had for so many years (and as was stated, goodbye pound, and entry into the Schengen region).

The blame will fall on the other party and the EU, because that's how politics works.

Jobs will move to Romania (Or China or to robots), since there is nothing any developed nation can do, other than to destroy wages entirely.

The real problem with muslims is less with Islam and more with Poverty+Fundamentalism. Eg, In Middle class Muslims, except for a very few people, ploygamy is looked down upon extremely.

Muslims are people, just like us, many share the same ideals of Liberty and freedom. But they wouldn't leave their culture in return for Europe. Because they shouldn't. If they are forced to, as I said, the ""cultural rights"" don't exist anymore.

Man, this feels like such a weird retroactive justification. Ostrogothic Italy, Visigothic Spain and even North Africa also have germanic pasts. The Vandals conquered what is now Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia and held it for about a century. But your germanic union doesn't include north africa, does it? And does it exclude Scotland, too?

&gt; They are all Protestant countries

I know *you're* specifically talking about the Nordics, but OP wasn't, so this doesn't really work. Speaking only for my own country, France is absolutely not protestant. According to Wikipedia it's 40 percent catholic, 2 percent protestant, and 20 percent atheist. And I'm betting the catholic numbers are exaggerated too because of people meaning their family background rather than practicing.

&gt; People really overstate the cultural diversity of Europe. For instance, there are more languages in individual countries in Asia and Oceania (and possibly Africa, but I'm not confident about that) then there are in the entirety of Europe.

Sure, but... people say Europe is culturally diverse **compared to America**. And even then, that's kind of a bad example, since India for instance has twice the population of the entire European union. Of course it has more languages. And a lot of them are similar or mutually intelligible. Number alone is not how you measure ""cultural diversity"".



Like overall I actually get your point. I've been to Denmark and found it very similar to the UK in terms of how manners work, what food they eat, etc. But then, if we put France on this list it's famous for being much colder than the others. 

Honestly stuff like that makes it so hard for me to take the rest of your comment at face value- the ""germanic"" thing is a nazi dogwhistle anyway (:c) so why even include this as a justification? How does both countries having germanic individuals in it 1500 years ago actually make us closer? Isn't there any other major events you can think of in the past millenium and a half that're more important than that? I can certainly think of some. And why bring up Germanic languages? English is a bastard language anyway and French isn't a Germanic language so you're clearly open to making exceptions?

I'd actually respect the point a lot more if you just said ""Because they're all wealthy nations, and I think it's more fair if we don't have to support impoverished regions that we have no political obligations to"" than to come up with weird pseudo-arguments to bolster things. The original poster made exceptions for countries that have Romance languages, and aren't Protestant, and aren't culturally similar to the others in the list, and drink wine instead of beer, but it's okay because they're rich, and we all know that's what you really mean, so why pollute your argument?

My Auntie is a small business owner. She voted leave due to the tariffs and constraints she feels the EU puts on her business when it comes to trade and business laws, and would like to be free to trade in a less rigid manner.

My Mum was unsure for a while and an example of a floating voter, but went for leave after feeling that the country shouldn't be dictated to by the EU anymore and we should get a greater say on our laws and regulations and systems. Her voting leave for me was an example of someone who shows that the leave campaign was effective in its job of getting people to support them, albeit through smearing, exaggerations and half truths.

My Grandad is of the generation that knows what happened back in the 1970s, when the country voted to join the EU. He voted to join the Union as he felt it would be better for our country. He ran a nationwide business, and is now retired, and has been for 16 years. He felt that the EU did more damage than harm in multiple facets (economically, business-wise and immigration), and would've preferred us to be back to the times where we weren't a part of it.

My Grandma....I'll just quote her....""I voted leave to kick the Muslims out of our country""....I don't need to explain that any further, only state that I condemn her islamaphobic views entirely and unequivocally.

What it shows is the facets of the leave voters. Some felt there was a future for them that was better for their lives and businesses outside of Europe, some felt disenfranchised in what they voted for 40 years ago, some were uncertain but just believed in the Leave campaign more than the Remain campaign (I should state, my Mum did go through a period of wishing she voted Remain instead of Leave) and some took the referendum as a chance to unleash pent up nationalist and racist ideologies in leaving the EU.

You brexiteers are radiating ignorance. Can't follow a basic Reddit comment chain.

&gt;You want to trample over distinct cultures and force foreign nations together in your federal fetish which will inevitably lead to bloodshed.

So you think I want to trample distinct cultures and I have a federal fetish. God forbid you have an IQ higher than my room temperature and ask yourself, why would this random guy over the Internet like a federation? Does he have a fetish? Or does he have legitimate arguments why a federation would be superior? You cannot go beyond your shitty nationalism to even ask those question because the moment something disagrees with your perception, you immediately call it with derogatory terms and use awful language like trample over cultures etc.

1. If you want to preserve cultures you need a strong country that could hold against outside influence, US with Hollywood already doing a good job of trampling the culture. If you have a strong country you subsequently have strong mechanisms to prevent other countries to destroy distinct cultures

2. The notion that you need a common culture to have a single country is incorrect. Many countries are multicultural, UK as well and many countries are multilingual, big (India, China) and small (Switzerland, Belgium)

3. Nothing will lead to bloodshed, the more interactions you make people have, the less likely you make them to have wars, EU already made a great progress in this area, a federal EU country would bring it on a whole new level

(Personal) I would be first to oppose the federalist movement if it meant the erosion of distinct cultures, I think distinct cultures make Europe great but I don't see a reason why all of these great cultures wouldn't be in a single country who would have much more power to protect those cultures. Federalism also is not something you fetishize about, it is something Europe needs if it is to survive in the world of big powers. US, China and India (soon), EU needs a similar structure to preserve it's interests in the world, if not for 1 European country, we will be the richest geopolitical battleground for those 3 big geopolitical powers, which could bring Europe once again to the new hostilities between us",True,False,True,,comment score below threshold,0,1580576351,,False,0,{},fg6t9ci,False,t3_ex59ho,False,True,t1_fg6r4xx,/r/europe/comments/ex59ho/eu_leaders_to_push_for_ever_closer_union_without/fg6t9ci/,False,,1589065546,-11,True,False,europe,t5_2qh4j,r/europe,public,0,[],

Children between 18 and 24 years of age consider anti-Semitic acts as a consequence of a widespread language based on hatred and racism with greater than average frequency: 67.6%, compared to values ​​around 60% in other age groups. Between 35 and 44 years of age there is the highest percentage of those who consider the anti-Semitic episodes that took place in Italy as stunts carried out by provocation or as a joke (41%); on the contrary, among the most mature, the lowest share was recorded (34.1%).

We have been together several years and we are raising a three years-old daughter together (four years in May).  We have been discussing marriage since we were seriously committed.

**In my opinion the courteous thing to do is to have two weddings, one in each country.  Not everybody has the means or the desire to travel to another country for a wedding.**

Many of our friends who are in international relationships share this opinion and practice.  Each wedding tends to be smaller, more personal, or less formal.  The most important question becomes one of formalities: In which country is the marriage legally registered?  Doing it in both countries is not necessarily a bad idea.  Obviously, registering the marriage where you intend to settle is a sensible idea.

My background: I am a naturalized UK citizen.  I moved here about 16 years ago from a non-EU country.  I am a dual citizen including the UK.  My previous serious relationship was with my girlfriend from the US.  We were planning to move to the US, marry, and settle there.  The fiance visa process took years.  Even though the visa application was successful by that time the relationship had fallen apart so I stayed in the UK.  I am also a marriage celebrant and have officiated at one wedding.

A long time ago I accepted that we would need to aspire to earn a good income if we wanted to afford to visit overseas relatives regularly.  Living an international life is not cheap.  When you add a child in the mix it become really tough.

Our families and friends are very supportive and they sometimes bend over backwards to make things financially easier for us.  **My aspiration is that our decision to maintain an international relationship and raise a child together should not impact our families and friends overseas.**",True,False,False,,,0,1580577443,,False,0,{},fg6uwvn,False,t3_ex5829,False,True,t3_ex5829,/r/weddingshaming/comments/ex5829/destination_weddings_are_selfish_except_when_its/fg6uwvn/,False,,1589066344,4,True,False,weddingshaming,t5_nhaha,r/weddingshaming,public,0,[],

How is that a statement. Okay Ive given plenty of examples why thats bullshit. How is that a debate?

&gt;With the exception of you, nobody has had any specific examples of any occasions where (other than government corruption) socio-capitalist policy has negatively impacted consumers, because by and large it doesnt.

Demonstrate how it doesnt. Show economic data to back up economic opinions. The onus of proof is on you.

&gt;It just relies on a clean government - not something most westerners think is possible.

How can self appointed dorks overseeing EU possibly coordinate the economic activities of millions of people as effectively as those people can do themselves? 

Government is not some abstract body. Its a collection of people with their own goals and their own incentives and inherit constrains on the amount of knowledge available to any given decision-maker or set of decision-makers. 


Why is it hard to picture a group of human beings functioning in a cohesive fashion without force? Just because you need a politician to make decisions for you because its hard for you to make personal decisions, doesnt mean its the same for everyone else. 

The fact that no given individual or set of individuals controls or coordinates all the innumerable economic activities in a market economy does not mean these things just happen randomly or chaotically. Each consumer, producer, retailer, landlord or worker makes individual transactions with other individuals on whatever terms they can mutually agree on. Prices convey these terms, not just to the particular individuals immediately involved but throughout the whole economic system- and indeed throughout the world. If someone else somewhere has a better product or service, that fact gets conveyed and acted upon through prices, without any elected official or planning commission having to issue orders to consumers or producers - indeed, faster than any planners could assemble the information on which to base their orders.


However overwhelming it might be for a government agency to try to keep track of 24 million prices, a country with more than a hundred million people can far more easily keep track of those prices individually, because no given individual or enterprise has to keep track of more than the relatively few prices that are relevant to their own decision-making. The over-all coordination of these innumerable isolated decisions takes places through the effect of supply and demand on prices and the effect of prices on the behaviour of consumers and producers. Money talks- and people listen. Their reactions are usually faster than central planners could get their reports together.

What is this guy? Some teenager coming from a bad breakup with his ex? Because it is exactly that sentiment: you are an idiot, i hate you and you should suffer! This is not how grown ups should handle a relationship and certainly not international diplomacy.

As an european i say we shuld do the exact opposite. While we do have to put us first and protect ur interests like the integrity of the single market and the rights of our citizens we should still keep good relations with the UK and hope they are going to do fine in the future. Not only because half of them actually wanted to stay in the EU but also because they are still there right next to us. The UK is still going to be an important partner in many different fields. Yes there are going to be tariffs but we are still going to sell a whole lot of stuff to the UK. Research funding is especially important as funding research usually also grants access to the results of said research.

As a side note and as a german like that guy who originally wrote it i might have to add that blocking sea routes didn't exactly work out last time either. You know, history. It would only make things worse and antagonize the UK which clearly won't get us any positive thing in return.

I highly doubt anyone would want to find themselves in the middle of a war zone, or suffering from famine etc. I think most of us just believe Britain will slowly suffer from economic decline and a loss of influence. I understand those things were happening before Brexit, but most experts believe it'll worsen now. 

Furthermore, even if some leavers don't believe the Tories *want* to lower standards etc, they may be forced to as our bargaining position in trade deals is pretty weak now. We'll see how that plays out though.

What you have to remember though, is that while we may have left the EU, we're still in the single market and customs union for now, and we still follow all the rules and regulations. We won't know what effect leaving the EU will have until the end of the transition period, and even then, that's just the beginning. We do know there have been plenty of negative effects already, and there's still the possibility we leave without a deal, which could have some pretty catastrophic consequences. The talk of violence and food shortages in that scenario were made by experts in the food industry, police, supermarkets etc. Even the governments own leaked analysis suggested those things, so you can't really write that of as remoaner fear. 

It might be irrelevant, as Boris could be lying again - as he was last time - and if Britain doesn't get a deal by the end of the year, he may accept an extension. It's hard to say now, as he does have that massive majority. If no deal does occur, it'll be a mess, but there won't be war and famine etc. For one thing, the EU said they'd be flexible and help us to make sure the effects were mitigated.

Also the EU is very susceptible to being used by big corporations to set legislation that shuts out competition. I've experienced this in my business.

The Nation: The US Government Under Both Obama And Trump Has Been Funding Nazis In Ukraine All Along - Congress Has Removed a Ban on Funding Neo-Nazis From Its Year-End Spending Bill Under Pressure From The Pentagon

Under pressure from the Pentagon, Congress has stripped the spending bill of an amendment that prevented funds from falling into the hands of Ukrainian neo-fascist groups.

By James Carden JANUARY 14, 2016

In mid-December 2015, Congress passed a 2,000-plus-page omnibus spending bill for fiscal year 2016. Both parties were quick to declare victory after the passage of the $1.8 trillion package. White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters “we feel good about the outcome, primarily because we got a compromise budget agreement that fought off a wide variety of ideological riders.” The office of House Speaker Paul J. Ryan touted the bill’s “64 billion for overseas contingency operations” for, among other things, assisting ”European countries facing Russian aggression.”

It would be safe to assume that one of the European countries which would stand to benefit from the omnibus measure—designed, in part, to combat “Russian aggression”—would be Ukraine, which has already, according to the White House, received $2 billion in loan guarantees and nearly $760 million in “security, programmatic, and technical assistance” since February 2014.

Yet some have expressed concern that some of this aid has made its way into the hands of neo-Nazi groups, such as the Azov Battalion. Last summer the Daily Beast published an interview by the journalists Will Cathcart and Joseph Epstein in which a member of the Azov battalion spoke about “his battalion’s experience with U.S. trainers and U.S. volunteers quite fondly, even mentioning U.S. volunteers engineers and medics that are still currently assisting them.”

Nothing terrifies Brussels more than the idea of real democracy, hence why they've never tried it and why they deliberately put their legislators beyond the reach of the ballot box.

This is not an accident, it is calculated policy that goes all the way back to Jean Monnet's first plans for a US of E. It was quite intentionally designed to be unaccountable to the European electorate - offering them just a fig-leaf of democracy, a pretence of democracy, with elections for MEPs, who are powerless to change the make up or direction of the EU institutions - or broader policy.

Those who'd watched the League of Nations fall apart (due to it having to allow for democratic decision-making) had learned a salutary lesson and were determined their new version would avoid such a mistake. Monnet and other architects of the European project all referenced the fact that building a pan-European entity to encompass such varied and disparate cultures would have been impossible if they'd stopped to ask the citizenry and so, quite deliberately, they didn't.

To say such a thing among European political scholars would not be at all controversial - it is only in the UK that EU zealots cling to the fiction that the EU is somehow a bastion of democracy - it simply isn't, really. Anyone who believes that the ""democratic"" affectation of elections for MEPs in any way represents actual democracy convicts themselves of frightening gullibility.

Yes, we are given the opportunity to vote for MEPs - but they have vanishingly little power (which is something most will cheerfully admit). They cannot propose or initiate legislation, merely amend. The power to initiate legislation - which is really the only genuine power - is held by the entirely unelected commission.

In the UK the reverse is true. The second chamber, the unelected House of Lords, has no real power beyond its ability to amend. It has no function in bringing about primary legislation. The House of Commons does that, and all the MPs in it are directly elected by the people they represent.

The biggest problems in this area are one, funding desired fertility control in poorer countries; and two, persuading patriarchal misogynistic religions and countries to change their stance on equality and birth control.

As regards resources, the reasons people don't have jobs or food, water, homes have nothing to do with actual shortages. It's greed.

&gt; Leading satellite mega-constellation companies SpaceX and OneWeb have met with astronomers in Europe to discuss the impact their operations could have on observations of the Universe.

&gt; Already, astronomers have talked of passing Starlink satellites producing streaks and &amp;quot;Ghosting&amp;quot; in telescope images; and of detectors becoming saturated in the glare from the satellites.

One of the reasons why they have been so successful is that they simply *are* religious people. The conservatives see the secularist rule as ""oppression against 'our Islamic culture' (*Arabic* culture),"" and AKP (the ruling party) reversed most of the hardline secularist rules to ""reverse"" the oppression. A good example is removing the ban of hijab placed for government employees. Back then the European media had criticized the secularists for being elitist and discriminating against Muslims, so they loved these changes.

However, once these secularist precautions were removed, Islam's putrid essence resurfaced. Women killings rose (iirc) 1600%. More families forced their kids into the hijab, because there was no rule against it. A so-called ""green industry"" emerged, promising Islamic business practices. These were heavily subsidized by the government, and later they indirectly controlled the gov via bribes. Heavy taxes on alcohol were put in place to discourage alcohol consumption. The Diyanet (a government administration put in place to control religion) turned more extremist, spreading their disgusting ideology to the Turkish diaspora in Western Europe.

Restart until Burgundy is friendly and rivaled with france, preferably Castile or Aragon too. Take all your estate bonus mana. Ally and RM Milan and try to RM scotland or austria too. Wait for HyW, keep your troops in two armies at 60% maintenance in northern france, build mercs to force limit. once war start move troops into anjou, and nantais if Brittany joins if not keep the other army adjacent.  Look at the desired peacedeal in peacedeal screen, find which nations will be pissed by holding over the coalition symbol next to the Green V and improve relations with them during the war.

If one year has passed since gamestart: Wait until an army is locked moving towards aquitaine. Pause the game, piss off Burghers and revoke aquataine. If not: wait and do this with Caen instead.  After this bring allies into war. You just siege and blockade. DO NOT FIGHT unless you can guarantee a win. Remember to improve relations.

After you win: If you forget to improve relations you need to wait for coalition to have a couple members then dow Brittany  and offer peace immediatly. They will just want provinces which will revolt back to you and france. Or you can reconquest them later for less AE than you lose from giving them away.

Now you just wait for manpower to go back up. If you have loans pay them down and try to hire some level 2 advisors followed by heavy ships. You want to own 11 heavies.  Do the mission to conquer scotland. Take 1 province bordering norway and vassal them, wait for AE to go down and take 3 irish provinces.  Dev up your capital to 30 dev.

From here you can go colonizer, hre or empire.

Colonizer: take  exploration, expansion, then admin and diplo. Colonize 5 provinces in every colonial region ASAP. Try to get CoT in Carribean. Take most of mexico. Colonize Ivory coast, Cape and the isles in the western indian ocean. Take madagascar and vijiyanigar. After this get as many trade company provinces as possible. This is the current easiest WC strat as GB  imo.

Hre: take diplo, admin, influence and exploration. Make a claim on norway and dow them. Take them as a vassal. If naples is still under Aragon do the same to them.  take some ideas in diplo for 20% warscore reduction and take sweden in the next war.  After this annex naples and sweden, vassalize novgorod and take livonian land.  Get all of the ivory coast and some of kilwas coast to get trading in ivory for +2 dip rep. After this do a humiliate war on emperor and improve relations with electors. You’ll become emperor and have the possibility to go protestant if needed. Take religious if you have to. Humanist if not.

Empire: take exploration, admin, influence, humanist. Ally aragon. Fabricate and declare on castile, take their coastal provinces. Do the same with portugal. If castile has PU with Ara check if france is stronger than ara first. You might wanna delay this war.

Claim norway and take norway + 3 swedish provinces in the war. Delete swedish forts. Now start working your way towards mexico, panama—&gt;inca, madagascar, java, india and Japan. Take all trade company land you can. Don’t explore more than you have to. If you take madagascar make sure you cant see india or indonesia. This will make it so you have no AE with the nations when you reach them. After this conquer asia, east africa, west africa and bully the other colonizers.

* Smalltalk. That the lady at the cash checkout or some random person in line would chat to you. At first I thought they were weird and sometimes if it happened at a bus stop I was seriously creeped out. Got used to it eventually. If you do that in Europe you are weird.

* The way people enjoy spending for the sake of spending. Germans are frugal and living above your means is so culturally taboo. Here spending and showing how much you can spend is people’s pride. For me I grew up feeling this way about saving. 

* Tips. Why the final price of something is not what is on the menue baffles me. How can people be paid through the goodwill and social norms instead of a simple salary. Include it in the price!!! Never got used to it and still find it revolting. Pay living wages ffs!!!!

* My friends calling their health insurance bankruptcy insurance. Blows my mind. 

* Lunch breaks being eaten at peoples desks. Here in Germany we all go together to a canteen and spend an hour or so socializing. 

* No vacation: lived there three years and almost burnt out due to the 2 week vacations I had. How do people do this long term? When do you recharge? My American colleagues seemed like burnt out zombies it was sad. Fetishization of workaholism does crazy things to people.

* Thing I love was how friendly people are to each other. At least where I lived. I tried to bring it back with me when I moved back but man we are grumpy in Europe

East Asian blepharoplasty, also known as ""double eyelid surgery"", is a type of cosmetic surgery where the skin around the eye is reshaped (blepharoplasty). The purpose of the procedure is to create an upper eyelid with a crease (i.e. ""double eyelid"") from an eyelid that is naturally without a crease (also known as a ""single eyelid"" or ""monolid"").Anatomically, there are a number of subtle differences in the upper eyelids of East Asians, compared with the eyelids of Europeans and Sub-Saharan Africans. While some East Asians have a double eyelid and some do not, there is also a large variation in the crease position (double eyelid size) of the East Asian upper eyelid.

Not entirely true, a few examples:

* I buy a lot of American goods and I like american cars and I expect the price of both to come down soon, what else, 
* there's been talk of FoM between some commonwealth countries, and those are things that'll benefit me personally (well besides the tampons lol),

* being able to negotiate trade deals without going through the commission and 27 other countries will benefit long term,

1. You can't visualize a supply and demand curve, with all its intricacies and details, without a pen and paper. Especially when it comes to modelling long-run shifts in the supply curve. Whereas the ""everything is labor"" heuristic can be quickly deployed in virtually any discussion on any medium.
2. Supply and demand curves treat supply shocks as exogenous variables that force you to re-draw a second supply curve; it's an extra layer of complexity. Whereas the ""everything is labor"" heuristic treats a shift in the supply curve as part of its simplistic reasoning; one can explain why training new people to do a job that was formerly done by a monopoly is a good idea.

Again, I'm bringing this up primarily in the context of discussions and rebuttals of a subset of left-wing ideas. Questions like ""why can't the government pay for everybody's education?"" or ""why can't the government pay for everybody's healthcare?"" or ""why wouldn't copying Europe's healthcare system lead to European healthcare results?"" can be answered expeditiously by seeing goods and services as transactions between profit-maximizing agents.

As the UK literally owns a major portion of the European Central Bank, due to massive investments over the years and then bailouts in return for shares during the financial crisis, and has the second seat on it's board, despite not even using the Euro, the EU can't even without a trade deal deny the Bank of England clearing facilities in Euros, not without breaking WTO law. 

It would be insane to do anyway, cut off your biggest investor? When growth is 0.1% in the EU? Why? British banks will happily invest anywhere, Africa and South East Asia is booming. 

&gt;**Reserves**
&gt;In addition to capital subscriptions, the NCBs of the member states participating in the euro area provided the ECB with foreign reserve assets equivalent to around €40 billion. The contributions of each NCB is in proportion to its share in the ECB's subscribed capital, while in return each NCB is credited by the ECB with a claim in euro equivalent to its contribution. 15% of the contributions was made in gold, and the remaining **85% in US dollars and UK pound Sterlings**

Infact the EU is so despite it signed a deal with the BoE to loan GBP directly to European financial firms if the zone enters recession again:

&gt;Bank of England will offer to lend euro to UK banks on a weekly basis

&gt;Bank of England to obtain euro from the ECB in exchange for pound sterling

&gt;**Eurosystem would stand ready to lend pound sterling to euro area banks, if a need arises**
The European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of England have decided to activate a standing swap line through which the Bank of England will offer to lend euro to UK banks on a weekly basis. The ECB will receive pound sterling from the Bank of England in exchange for euro. The activation marks a prudent and precautionary step by the Bank of England to provide additional flexibility in its provision of liquidity insurance, supporting the functioning of markets that serve households and businesses.

The swap line between the ECB and the Bank of England is part of a network of standing arrangements with four other central banks, including the Bank of Canada, the Bank of Japan, the Federal Reserve, and the Swiss National Bank. These standing swap lines were agreed in October 2013 and replaced a set of temporary arrangements. Liquidity providing arrangements contribute to global financial stability.

And none of this even takes into account the huge infrastructure investments the UK made in countries like Spain through the European Investment Bank, who estimates it will take 35 years to pay the UK back fully now they have left.

1. Remove member veto rights on foreign policy with an eye to further removal of veto on other issues. Ball currently rolling on that.

2.

So, I took a sharpie and outlined all the countries and coasts, then cut off the white border, put it in the middle of the back of another blank paper, shined a bright light behind it, and outlined everything in pencil. 

Because of the thick sharpie, I lost some details, so I had to manually go back to each line and edit the little details back in like islands, proper shapes of borders, etc, with a pencil, and that's why it doesn't look identical to the original map. 

To finish, I went over everything in pen and voila

They may be industrial areas but stations at those locations offer convenient one-transfer rides to a large variety of destinations.  With the right station layout I'd arrive on a Metro North train at Port Morris, step across the platform to a waiting NJT train and arrive in Newark less than an hour later.  Those transfers can be made at Penn today (or at least when MNRR Penn Station access is completed), but Penn Station as it exists today is awful for transferring.  Shunting the transfer of passengers to the periphery of the urban area with the termination of the commuter traffic reduces the interference between transfering and originating/terminating passenger trips.  That way vertical circulation can be reserved for passengers accessing the platform to begin or end their trips rather than those transferring from one line to another. 

&gt; Jersey City-Lower Manhattan-Downtown Brooklyn.

Lower Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn are certainly well outside the scope of the project, requiring another few dozen gigadollars in funding for tunnels before anyone might take it seriously. ReThink's proposal maximizes extant infrastructure, eliminates costly city-center terminals, and utilizes commuter rail to provide a rail transit trunk across region's core.  I would argue that the creation of the Secaucus transfer facility would at least open up the possibility of LIRR trains linking Jersey City directly to Downtown Brooklyn via Lower Manhattan some day in the far future when tens of billions of dollars are found to build a line past Atlantic Ave.

&gt; You also can't solve the entire network through one corridor without running into capacity issues...which is why the other proposes by the RPA , Alon levy and Transportation advocates call for multi-routes.

Again, if we had the tens of billions of dollars lying around to do that then that might contemplate multiple lines.  We barely have the funding in place to add another tunnel under the Hudson.  Trimming Penn Station South frees up a few billion, but it's hardly going to be sufficient to fund Alon Levy's pipe-dream network, even if we assume European construction costs.  Focusing on what is within the scope of the project will allow the creation of a network which maximizes passenger convenience while reducing costs.

&gt;The 7 to Secaucus seems to mainly developers instead if the 7 or L are extended over to NJ it should go through Hoboken and terminate somewhere in Jersey City to relieve the overcrowded PATH train system.

Why Hoboken?  Secaucus offers a more convenient transfer for almost all NJT commuter rail/bus passengers who might want to reach destinations along 42nd St.  Going via Hoboken results in a significant trip out of the way for those passengers, and eliminates the option of a single transfer ride to 42nd St for many NJT passengers.  Run the 7 to Secaucus, move the passengers currently transferring from NJT to PATH at Hoboken to the 7 train at Secaucus and those PATH trains will have much more room to transport passengers whose trips originated in Jersey City and vicinity.",True,False,False,,,0,1580599129,,False,0,{},fg7qsak,True,t3_exd3f7,False,True,t1_fg7o7hk,/r/transit/comments/exd3f7/every_plan_to_fix_penn_station_ranked/fg7qsak/,False,,1589081502,1,True,False,transit,t5_2qha9,r/transit,public,0,[],

Another reason is trying to unite such a disparate collection of cultures and economies under one roof. The US federation is different, in that all states speak the same language and, despite all states having individual characteristics, the 'American' identity is ubiquitous; you share the same flag, the same constitution, you are one country. 

Europe is not like that. Europe has, for centuries, been a morphing collection of groups that would become nations. The UK has always been somewhat removed from the rest, in part a consequence of geography.

This is phrased as though that support is something everyone is looking for. The whole argument is phrased as them looking down on ""inferior"" practices, instead of acknowledging that people have different spiritual needs (and that the corrupt infrastructure of the Catholic Church and others have in themselves *driven away* people who might have been content getting their spiritual needs met there). Not to mention how much of many meditation practices is also deeply culturally ingrained (it's just not European, Christianity-based culture, so obviously it doesn't count).

*Some* of the rise of those apps probably can be attributed to people seeking a different spiritual or moral framework, but the assumption that that's somehow misguided, and that meditation is inherently a substitute for prayer instead of a potentially parallel practice is bogus. It's not like meditators don't know Christianity and other major theistic religions exist. I grew up in a vaguely Catholic house (father was raised strictly Catholic but mostly lapsed, his sibling and parents were devout to the end). I could appreciate the cultural context and history around it, but that doesn't magically make me a believer.

I'm not opposed to the idea that there's an omnipotent creator, but I haven't seen sufficient evidence to say the specific deities worshiped by any of the major world religions is it. Saying I believed it would be a lie, and an omnipotent creator would *know* it was a lie, so why bother? I'm content to try to live a moral life based on reducing suffering in the world. I don't need the threat of eternal damnation to keep me in line, which seems to be the only thing stopping some Christians from doing what they actually want to be doing.

What he says about having to assess impacts on species that are not present in the UK is just wrong.  The example where a species is rare in the continent and common in the UK is also a misunderstanding. It is likely that op refers to great created newts. This species is rare in many places in the EU, but that isn't the reason it is protected. Great created newts' population in the UK has plummeted over the last 70 years or so, mostly due to agricultural intensification.  Something like 80% of ponds in farmland have been removed.  I know newts aren't sexy, and there are certainly other species facing greater extinction threat in the UK, but that are categorically not protected on British soil because of declines in the continent, they are protected due to population declines here.   They are still widespread, and so many developments with a large footprint will have to have surveys for them, and potentially mitigation and licensing.

It is also worth noting that the EU does not pass laws. It passes regulations, which UK MEPs debated and voted on before being passed on Brussels and which the UK parliament enact in laws that they wrote in London.   The legislation that the UK has written for species and habitat conservation is it's own doing, stems from pre-existing UK legislation that had nothing to do with the EU and widely considered poorly thought out. For example the legislation (not the EU regulation) protects individual animals rather than populations, so a single newt can cause project delays, whereas it would be much more sensible to focus mitigation on preserving and enhancing populations. In recent years DEFRA and Natural England have been unpicking this a bit to make things smoother, but it is the constraints set by our own legislation that they are unpicking.

Finally (maybe not, I'm on a roll) ... Leaving the EU will not mean that the OP doesn't have to conduct impact assessments. This is required under the UK town and country planning act. Countries world over have requirements for environmental impact assessments and this will not stop having left the EU.

Over time footballing tactics changed and such a top-heavy formation became impractical. Two of the half backs dropped back to become central defenders, with the other one staying in the middle of the pitch as a defensive midfielder. In England, this was normally the one with the 4, whereas in much of continental Europe it was the one with the 6 who stayed in midfield (though there are plenty of different traditional numbering schemes on the continent - the Hungarian one especially is pretty unique). The inside forward with the number 8 dropped back to become a box-to-box midfielders, and the inside forward with the 10 became and attacking midfielder or second striker, which is where the name of the 'number 10' role comes from.

Nu ma uit la CNN. Faptul ca esti obsedat de CNN si il aduci in discutie din neant este inca un exemplu ca esti copy/paste la fel ca ceilalti.

&gt;Ma intrebai de unde stiu eu ca retorica woke e pe moarte. Ti-am pus niste intrebari ajutatoare ca sa iti indic faptele care mi-au dat mie de inteles acest lucru. Se pare ca si tu cunosti aceste fapte.

Si aia din cercul tau sunt ""woke"". Folosesc alt termen in schimb, ""redpilled"". Inseamna aceeasi porcarie.

&gt;E absolut ireal cum l-am asociat pe Darwin cu Fox News si Info Wars pentru a te ridiculiza iar tu iei satira mea si incerci cumva sa o intorci pentru a da un fel de legitimitate foarte dubioasa argumentului tau inexistent. 

Tu i-ai adus pe toti aia in discutie. Nu eu. Eu doar am aratat cu degetul la termeni. E un semnal de alarma, atata tot.

&gt;Sintagma 'virtue signaling' nu este un concept nou

Stiu ca nu e noua sintagma. Ba chiar este valida. Dar este folosita in mod eronat in prostie, ca si in thread-ul asta de altfel. E una sa te prefaci ca iti pasa de chestii pt aplauze pe net, e alta sa condemni o atrocitate. Cand il vad folosit, in 90% din cazuri si asta lasat si de la mine, e folosit in mod eronat.

&gt;In schimb, pronumele 'ze' este exponent al unui concept nou, anume acela ca exista zeci de sexe. 

Si sa-mi bag piciorul daca l-am vazut folosit mai mult de 3-4 ori de 5 ani incoace. E folosit de 2-3 dezaxati, dar unii pretind ca e peste tot.

&gt;Ah, deci tu esti reabilitat. Ai un trecut de bigot pentru ca te uitai la PJW, dar CNN, Digi si USR ti-au deschis ochii.... Am inteles. 

Nu CNN, Digi si USR mi-au deschis ochii. Dar am observat treptat evolutia de la a rade de cativa colorati in cap care se comporta ridicol, la a ii hiperboliza de parca ei controleaza societatea si o distrug, la ""soia exista in mancare, pentru ca evreii vor sa feminizeze barbatii din vest ca sa ii faca slabi, ca musulmanii sa poata sa distruga vestul"". E un pas mare de la comportament adolescentin la teorii de conspiratie cu tema de extrema dreapta. Deja se intra in teritoriu agendelor extremiste.

&gt;Nu, deoarece, in caz ca nu era evident pana acum, si mie mi se pare o porcarie, alaturi de toate aberatiile ce stau sub semnul politicilor woke... Despre asta e vorba.... Esti ireal de confuz, jur.

Nu, deoarece nu exista asa ceva. Asta e raspunsul. Daca ii vedeai asa de des, macar retineai si tu cativa. Are sens?

&gt;Daca ar fi asa, utilizand logica ta stupida, ar insemna ca si USR sunt o mizerie pentru ca liceeni de pe roddit ii vad ca pe niste zei... nu?

I think that the cultural tide has already shifted on Christianity, and it's a lesser priority. Like, if there are a row of houses on fire, Christianity is one that the firefighters have mostly put out, and Islam is one still burning fiercely. Christianity, especially in the West, has gotten fat and lazy. I see an awful lot of ""christians"" who've never read the Bible and don't go to church, which I'd personally consider minimum requirements. So as much as Christianity is still full of things I don't like, I am the kind of person where, I am going to focus most of my energy on issues I see not a lot of other people addressing.

&gt;At the peak of the Ottoman Empire, it had more religious toleration than any of the other major European power.

And Baghdad was the scientific capital of the world for a while. Thing is, I'm very much a pragmatist. I don't care about what a thing was then, I care about *now*, because *now* is what I have to put up with. Same as I'm not impressed by when Republicans say, ""The Democrats used to support slavery!"" Yes. *Used to.* I know the rise in Wahhabiism is relatively recent. But I also know it is an extreme form of what was already shared among billions of believers. Most religions are subject to change based on current cultural values. They cherry-pick the parts that agree with what they want to believe. So, to an extent, I kind of don't care why Islam has ended up at this point. I just see it as a danger. I imagine my gay best friends in a Saudi jail, and I see red.

&gt;Of course many Muslims and Christians find a deeper meaning in their religions, find that they give them purpose in life, find that they make them more likely to be kind, find them to simply fulfill important social functions, feel like they provide a base of morality, and find them a comforting place to turn to in an often uncomfortable world.

I understand the need for spirituality. The need to believe in something more than just this life. My objection is to the enforcement of a shared belief. 'You have to take comfort in THIS book, or else your family will disown you'. I am fine with people questing to find their own meaning. But when it comes from an organization, it is too easy to train people to believe that morality is whatever authority figures say it is.",True,False,False,,,0,1580604336,,1580604631,0,{},fg7xydl,True,t3_exexo0,False,False,t1_fg7w1rd,/r/changemyview/comments/exexo0/cmv_i_am_islamophobic/fg7xydl/,False,,1589084891,25,True,False,changemyview,t5_2w2s8,r/changemyview,public,0,[],

- An official European Parliament (or similar, don't remember exactly) Twitter Account posted news articles strongly in favour of the Directive instead of remaining neutral as should be the case.
- Many parties of different countries in favour of the Directive, most notably the EPPs, disregarded protesters completely, leading all the way up to direct insults or attempted humiliation of specific people. Protesters writing passionate emails about the concerns about the Directive were ignored and called ""just Google's bots"".
- Valid criticism and the largest petition in European history were discarded by many parties, and seemingly no independent experts were asked on the ramifications on the Directive. Rather, large corporations were asked.
- After protests against the Directive were announced by many countries, the EPP tried to move the parliament vote on the Directive to an earlier date to circumvent any public outcry. Afterwards, they claimed no such thing was ever planned, despite clear evidence.

Il y a des dizaines de critères éliminatoires, cela ne vise pas exclusivement les LGBT. 


L’adoption n’est facile pour personne, présente moi un couple hétéro pour qui ça a été facile, je suis curieuse. Mis à par quelques célébrités qui vont acheter des bébés à l’autre bout du monde pour flatter leurs égos, TOUS les adoptants vivent un véritable parcours du combattant, des années d’attente, de faux espoirs, de douleurs et dans certains cas d’échecs. 


La majorité des couples aujourd’hui vivent maritalement, ne se marient jamais et ne vivent pas plus mal que leurs aînés qui se mariaient à 20/25 ans. Tu vas à contre courant de la “norme”, comme quoi ...


Si ton conjoint n’a pas de papier que tu sois homo ou hétéro, il a de grands risques d’expulsion et être mariés ne garantit pas des papiers, tu peux même être poursuivi pour mariage blanc. 


La plupart des flics diront à une femme qui s’est faite violer que c’est de sa faute, qu’elle l’a cherché parce qu’elle portait une jupe ou était “trop” apprêtée. Un homme hétéro se fait agresser, la police refusera de prendre la plainte dans plein de cas. On a vu le cas sur ce sub même. Une personne veut porter plainte pour violence familiale, la police essaie de faire passer ça en main courante ou de l’en dissuader, parce que c’est moins de boulot, ça ne demande aucune enquête. Ce n’est pas un traitement réservé au LGBT, la discrimination à la plainte touche tout le monde. 


Ce que tu penses être exclusivement une “oppression” envers les LGBT c’est en réalité les problèmes de monsieur et madame tout le monde. Le truc c’est qu’à force de ne regarder que les gens auxquels on s’identifie ou son nombril, on oublie que les autres peuvent aussi vivre la même chose et quand on se le fait dire, on trouve toujours une excuse pour tenter de prouver qu’on est différent.

The jet stream plays a significant role in whether or not we have warm or cold winters. The jet stream is a really fast high moving stream of air that flows around the northern hemisphere - all the way around Canada, Europe, and Asia. The jet stream separates the cold arctic air in the north from the hot warm air in the south. Its a very good barrier and keeps these two air masses separated.

[This video](https://youtu.be/37wcfLeZ9u8) and [this one](http://climatecrocks.com/2014/01/07/new-video-climate-jetstream-polar-vortex/) explain the jet stream phenomenon better than I can, I suggest watching the videos first. Video ELI5: Think of the jet stream like a meandering river, but in air. On one side of the river, the northern bank, you find a mass of cold arctic air. On the other side of the river, the southern bank, you find a mass of warm southern air. If you live on the northern bank, you are going to experience colder temperatures. If you live on the southern bank, you are going to experience warmer temperatures. The banks of the river will meander over time such that one season you might find yourself on the northern bank (cold winter) and the next season you might find yourself on the southern bank (warm winter). [Here is a video from NASA that visualizes what I mean.](https://youtu.be/BVUP9_Dms5Q).

Before we started messing with the climate the jet stream ran at a pretty good pace. Which meant that we weren't going to be stuck with cold weather (or warm weather) in the winter for very long. The weather would change more quickly in any given winter as the jet stream meandered back and forth over a season. So each winter you were likely going to experience both warm and cold temperatures as you shifted what side of the bank you lived on.

**Effect of Climate Change on Jet Stream**

As we pump more GHG's (e.g. CO2 and methane) into the atmosphere the jet stream is slowing down (videos explain this in greater detail). This results in the meanders getting bigger and slower. This means that in any given year we are more likely to be stuck with one kind of weather type (cold arctic air, or warm southern air) for longer periods of time. It also means that the cold arctic air, or warm southern air will penetrate further south or north respectively. So just expect more of the same really, but for longer periods of time. This can make our winters seem more harsh if we get stuck in a mass of cold arctic air that doesn't move because our jet stream is slowing. It can also make our winters seem more balmy if we get stuck in a mass of warm southern air that doesn't move.

**On Snow**

Warming causes more moisture in the air which leads to more extreme precipitation events. This includes more heavy snowstorms in regions where snowfall conditions are favourable. Far from contradicting global warming, record snowfall is predicted by climate models and consistent with our expectation of more extreme precipitation events, **t*****o a point,*** eventually [the atmosphere will warm to such a degree that more precipitation will fall as water than as snow](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-34450-3). Its possible that a century or more from now there will be significantly less snow, but it won't likely be for many centuries before no snow falls altogether. There have been indeed times it Earth's climatic past when very little to no snow would have fallen.

[There are \[also\] a variety of ways to measure snow](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/love-snow-heres-how-its-changing/)—the amount of snow that falls from the air, its depth on the ground, the amount of total water the snowpack contains, and the total surface area it covers on the earth. That’s just a few. Now add climate change. It has conflicting influences on snow. In many places, rising temperatures may increase the chances that snow will turn to rain before it hits the earth or that it will melt faster once it’s on the ground. On the other hand, warmer air is capable of holding more moisture and producing more precipitation. That means in some very cold climates, where there’s still plenty of room for temperatures to stay below freezing, warming could actually cause an increase in snow.

**We are already seeing the effects of a warming climate on snow cover:** here in [Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/climate-change/canadian-centre-climate-services/basics/trends-projections/changes-snow.html) we have snow on the ground for fewer days during the year, with the first snow dates coming later and the first snow melts coming sooner - overall winter is shortening in Canada. ""The number of days per season with snow cover has decreased by 5% to 10% per decade across most of Canada and during most seasons from 1981 to 2015. These decreases are due to later snow cover onset in the fall and earlier snow melt in the spring as a result of warming trends across most of Canada."" Here is more from the [Government of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/environmental-indicators/snow-cover.html) and [NOAA](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-spring-snow-cover) on current snow trends: Records from the last five decades show that on average, spring snow is disappearing earlier in the year than it did in the past, with the most rapid declines in snow-covered area occurring in June. Across the Northern Hemisphere, the total area covered by snow during March and April has also shrunk over time. Overall, warmer temperatures are shortening the amount of time snow is on the ground in the Northern Hemisphere. Recent temperature increases in the Arctic have also led to decreased snow and ice cover in many areas during parts of the year. And, they’ve also led to earlier melting of snow cover, which is changing when and how much water is available in some rivers and reservoirs as well as lengthening the growing season ([source](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/news/picture-climate-what%E2%80%99s-snow-cover-got-do-it)).

They absolutely are. In fact, they are relatively small fish at the very top, except for Ratcliffe. But for every Ratcliffe you have several Richard Bransons or Julian Marc Dunkertons. You can see why the likes of Branson, who benefits immensely from lobbying and getting his grubby hands in public infrastructure (transportation (airlines, railways), the music industry, mobile, etc) would absolutely love the EU. OTOH, people who are in stuff that the EU hurts more than helps like insurance, bookmakers, offshore finances - they have motives to be biased against the EU.

&gt;But clearly the Brexit movement was not something that swelled up from the masses. 

You'd be wrong. The UK has always been EU-skeptic, for many reasons going back a long time. For starters, it's seen as yet another European superstate project like the Austro-Hungarian empire, napoleonic France's sphere, the USSR and Nazi Germany and their annexed ""lebensraum"". We have a long history with those.

&gt;And wow, what a great example of how democracy that runs on private contributions is not at all democracy

Funding is one of the major challenges of democracy in modern times, the other being surveillance capitalism. It's not any better when politicians are funded publicly without much oversight (as in the EU) - as they become even less accountable and incentivised to growing their pie.

It's no wonder that EU institutions are designed in a way that raises massive suspicion by those here in the UK who appreciate our own system. Theirs is really antithetical to ours. At the popular level, there is a direct relation to the appreciation or lack thereof of our own institutions, and EU-skepticism. They are polar opposite schools of thought.

The average PoV of the over-40 is well encapsulated in this doco, which isn't particularly partisan but may appear so: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PD4sSFq_nWg

&gt; Beijing has hit back at countries which have placed travel restrictions on Chinese travellers, saying such measures go against the World Health Organization’s (WHO) recommendations.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Veiled criticism

&gt; A Saturday, Feb. 1 tweet posted by China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) on its official Twitter account noted the Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s remarks that a “certain country has turned a blind eye to WHO recommendations” by imposing “sweeping travel restrictions against China”.

&gt; In the same phone call, FM Wang noted certain country has turned a blind eye to WHO recommendations and imposed sweeping travel restrictions against China. This kind of overreaction could only make things even worse. It's not the right way to deal with the pandemic. — Spokesperson发言人办公室 (@MFA_China) February 1, 2020

&gt; The tweet further said such travel restrictions are “not the right way to deal with the pandemic” as they are a sort of “overreaction” that could “make things even worse”.

&gt; The South China Morning Post (SCMP) noted that the United States, the European Union, Russia, Australia and Singapore have banned or restricted the entry of Chinese citizens, and any foreigners that have recently visited China.

&gt; Other countries that have placed travel restrictions on visitors from China include Mongolia, Malaysia (residents from Hubei), the Philippines (residents from Hubei), and Japan (residents from Hubei).

&gt; Chinese state media has also criticised countries that placed travel restrictions on China, with a CGTN article citing Wang’s comments as saying that China “opposes certain countries’ actions that are creating tension and panic”.

&gt; WHO: Travel restrictions not necessary

&gt; While the WHO has declared the novel coronavirus a global public health emergency on Thursday, Jan. 30, it has yet to issue any advisory against travel to China.

&gt; The international organisation has also opposed any move to close borders with China or restrict Chinese travellers’ access, SCMP reported.

&gt; China, on the other hand, has banned all outbound group travel from Jan. 27, and placed 16 cities under lockdown indefinitely in an attempt to contain the spread of the virus.

&gt; In response to China’s MFA tweet, former Mexican Ambassador to the China (2007-2013) Jorge Guajardo said that China, against WHO’s recommendation, placed all Mexican nationals in China under quarantine and cancelled direct flights to Mexico during the swine flu epidemic.

&gt; In 2009 H1N1, against WHO recommendation, China: – Placed all Mexican nationals in China under quarantine.

&gt; – Cancelled direct flights to Mexico.

&gt; – Stopped issuing visas to Mexicans.

&gt; – Closed consulates in Mexico. China never admitted this was wrong, or apologized. https://t.co/5ytVSqOwRj — Jorge Guajardo (@jorge_guajardo) February 1, 2020

&gt; He later added, however, that US’s reaction (travel ban) is as bad as China government’s reaction on coronavirus.

&gt; The only thing that’s as bad as the Chinese government’s actions on coronavirus is the US reaction. Travel bans don’t accomplish anything and are not scientifically justified. They disincentivize transparency, as governments fear sanctions. Cooperation, not retribution. — Jorge Guajardo (@jorge_guajardo) February 1, 2020

&gt; Thanked some countries for their support to China

&gt; In yet another tweet a couple of hours later, the Chinese MFA thanked a number of countries, such as France, Germany, and Malaysia, saying that they have provided “assistance and support to China”.

&gt; To help China fight against #nCoV, Russia, Pakistan, ROK, Belarus, France, Germany, Malaysia and UNICEF and many others are providing assistance and support to China. Thanks to you all! A friend in need is a friend indeed. — Spokesperson发言人办公室 (@MFA_China) February 1, 2020

&gt; The tweet did not provide additional details as to how these countries helped China out.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Thanked Russia &amp; Malaysia

&gt; The post also mentioned Russia as one of the countries that supported China, despite Russia closing its land border with China to most passenger travel, and limiting visa issuance to Chinese citizens.

&gt; China also thanked Malaysia despite the local government of Sabah and Sarawak restricting travel of Chinese citizens into East Malaysia.

I think it's different in the USA though. Trump has revealed his party's true intentions on several occasions: tradition, America first, whites first. Put briefly.

In the US he's currently sacrificing much of his party's true interests in an attempt to get votes. Obviously necessary, as the demographic his party truly supports is too small to win by itself. But the USA is doomed by globalists if we don't change our political and government structure.

When this conversation happened then he was at the peak of recklessness. In those moments in Mizumono he was far from the meticulous cold controlled killer - even his hair and clothes were out of order, very different from the murder suit wearing gelled hair cool predator. If you notice he called Abigail after Will pointed out to him that 'I already did' .. it looked like a dare, as if an ego is hurt, 'so you want to tell me I changed ?' look I am so destructive. There was much more that wen to the killing of Abigail but this was there too. He reacted to what Will said.

As we saw from beginning to end - He was initially not willing to sacrifice his reputation, later he was and was ready to move out of Baltimore but still not ready to sacrifice freedom, later we see he surrenders, and finally we was fine with 'laying down his life for a bro-friend.' He seemed to have buried a part of his soul which sprung back with Will's entry. 

Like Gideon pointed out when he asked 'why am I allowing this ?'.. 'if only the company could be Will Graham'. He was happy single and busy killing eating partying but after meeting Will he just couldn't stay alone again, even Gideon for company, later Bedelia.. he was ok with surrender. ( In a way even Will - after meeting Hannibal he couldn't stay alone, first Alana even Margot, Chiyoh's kiss, finally a marriage)

The other part is he allowed himself to be influenced by Will. In season 2 he not only murdered for Will but he sort of settled with the kind of bad people Will would choose to hunt. After Will's 'I already did' when he was in Europe he tried his best to do a rebound - waltzing Bedelia and killing as aimlessly as possible to shrug off the influence. But he was finally back there again though killing Francis with Will. 

IMO the reason why he was so fascinated with Will was that he was attracted to his brand of righteous hunt. He thought it was powerful and purposeful.

Well - the Nazis easily surpassed them in every category. Medieval Europe tortured every heretic and suspected witch to death, so the scale was there. The Belgian Congo (plus a few other similar colonial/slave-labor ventures) is also comparable - not so modern in methods, but chopping the limbs off thousands and thousands in order to terrify them into compliance qualifies. CIA torture programs over the years are at least in the same ball park for numbers of victims and bizarre cruelty of methods.

&gt;Id rather die 10 times on a atomic blast then to be tortured

Do you know that tens of thousands of victims didn't die instantly? That they died over days, months, years, and decades from burns, radiation poisoning, cancer? All some of the most painful ways to die.

&gt;Let me remind you that the values that the americans have the public would NEVER let the government do such things

Uhhh. US government scientists famously let people die from syphilis ""for science"" in the Tuskegee experiments while pretending to treat them. They also [purposefully infected hundreds of people in Guatemala](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/39456324/ns/health-sexual_health/t/us-apologizes-guatemala-std-experiments/) (after overthrowing its democratic government) with syphilis and gonorrhea.

Look into the long history of CIA using things like genital electrocution on prisoners in Southeast Asia and Latin America - or training the local brutal regime to do it. Real American values right there.

Also - look into Abu Ghraib and enhanced interrogation and waterboarding and purposeful anal feeding in Guantanamo. Some of those were cold-blooded (as much good as that does), but a fuckload of it was sadistic for sure.

Some of these were punished, sure, but on the whole the torturers and abusers were directed and protected at the highest level of government and everyone involved retired and remained respected.

The US keeps Andrew Jackson on its money, a President who violated the Constitutional authority of the judiciary to commit brutal ethnic cleansing against the Cherokee and other Indians. Lots of monuments and places still named for slavers, imperialists, and proponents of White supremacy...

""And the world lets them go because they are some pathetic *fat clowns* hiding behind their *comic book movies* and spineless culture."" (The latter is sarcasm, because I don't think you can condemn every individual in a country for the past crimes of its leaders, but it's super easy to turn this around - Japanese culture has a lot more respect around the world than American culture does.)

I actually think government funded healthcare is largely a good thing (maybe not all aspects of healthcare - that is up for debate).  However, you can't do it at today's prices.  The US spends FAR more than anybody else on just about every aspect of care (well, maybe other than generic medicines, which are actually pretty reasonable in the US setting aside the epipen nonsense).  

One of the issues with healthcare (and education BTW) is that everybody wants to have all the savings come from somebody else.  Let's sock it to these one or two small groups that don't employ too many voters!  The problem is that inevitably those groups account for only a small percentage of the costs, and it isn't like you can completely reduce any of the costs to zero so you're only going to reduce it so much.  Maybe insurance companies are 5-8% of the costs, and you might replace it with government single payer administration at 3% of the costs.  That's a great start, but clearly you're not going to get us down to France levels (a very expensive country BTW) that way, since that requires reducing costs by something like 60%.  

Sooner or later if you want to make education/healthcare/etc cheaper you're going to have to make your neighbor the teacher/nurse/doctor/dentist/etc take a significant pay cut.  We're not talking minimum wage, but it is going to change their standard of living.  Oh sure, we'll also make the big corporations take a haircut, but a big chunk of the expense goes to salaries.  Your friend the single mother who works as a secretary booking appointments might get replaced by a government website that schedules every doctor in the country.

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**“The message should remain the same that this is a complex behavior that genetics definitely plays a part in,”** said study co-author Fah Sathirapongsasuti, a computational biologist at genetic testing company 23andMe in Mountain View, Calif., during a press conference. **The handful of genetic studies conducted in the past few decades have looked at only a few hundred individuals at most—and almost exclusively men. Other studies have linked sexual orientation with environmental factors such as hormone exposure before birth and having older brothers.**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The researchers found five single points in the genome that seemed to be common among people who had had at least one same-sex experience. Two of these genetic markers sit close to genes linked to sex hormones and to smell—both factors that may play a role in sexual attraction. But taken together, these five markers explained less than 1 percent of the differences in sexual activity among people in the study. When the researchers looked at the overall genetic similarity of individuals who had had a same-sex experience, genetics seemed to account for between 8 and 25 percent of the behavior. The rest was presumably a result of environmental or other biological influences. The findings were published Thursday in [*Science*](https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aay2726)*.*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Despite the associations, the authors say that the genetic similarities still cannot show whether a given individual is gay. “It’s the end of the ’gay gene,’” says Eric Vilain, a geneticist at Children’s National Health System in Washington, D.C., **who was not involved in the study.**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**The research has limitations: almost all of the participants were from the U.S. or Europe, and the individuals also tended to be older—51 years old on average in the 23andMe sample and at least 40 in the UK Biobank sample.**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**Rice and Vilain agree that the conclusion is unclear.** A more detailed questionnaire that looks at more aspects of sexuality and environmental influences would allow the researchers to better pinpoint the roots of attraction.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The authors say that they did see links between sexual orientation and sexual activity, but concede that the genetic links do not predict orientation. “I think it’s true we’re capturing part of that risk-taking behavior,” Sathirapongsasuti says, but the genetic links still suggested that same-sex behavior is related to attraction.

It sounds like you barely even read the article. Genetics is a complex field, and this article shows a shrivel of that. There is no concise consensus on either side. It's likely that there won't be for a long time. Plus, it mentions nothing about a panel of scientists even peer-editing it, yet you already take it as an acceptable theory. That is not the way of the scientific method.

It's sad to think someone who is on r/medicine doesn't even care about the science, but rather some message they wish to spread.

You can also look at individual cities. Here's Warsaw: [https://www.numbeo.com/crime/in/Warsaw](https://www.numbeo.com/crime/in/Warsaw)

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at the comparisons for London vs Warsaw/Krakow/Wroclaw, all three Polish cities score better on every safety metric than London does. The only metric they score sightly worse on is corruption but that doesn't have to do with personal safety. So if you've survived London, chances are very high that you'll survive those three cities as well.

You definitely don't have to sit in your hotel room for 6pm onward. I've walked with another female friend at 2 am in downtown Warsaw and we never felt unsafe.

Regarding the racism, of course there are racist people everywhere. But you have consider the history of racism and race relations in a given country. Poland didn't have colonies like England did. Poland didn't have slaves like the US did. Poland didn't really have any contact with non-caucasians until the 20th century (there was actually a black Jazz player in the Warsaw Uprising during WWII - the only black person in Warsaw then). So racism from Poland is more along the lines of ignorance and just never having seen a black person before. I can't speak for the UK, but in the US racism and race relations are mired with the tragic history of slavery, which then evolved into black Americans being second-class citizens and systematically oppressed, to now. The attitudes run deep and they run for generations from personal experience. In Poland there was no such thing. There weren't large groups of black people living in Poland, oppressed or not. There were no colonies on a different continent inhabited by black people whom native Poles actively subjugated. The history and baggage is just not there in Poland. It might be like fair-skinned, blue-eyed, blonde haired Polish person visiting Zimbabwe. I'm sure they would get stared at too, right? And some people might mutter something as well. But I wouldn't expect much or any racism or hatred against that Polish person, would you?

 A televisão tem o dom de entregar os olhos do personagem e, como diz o povo, eles espelham a alma. É por isso que, mesmo sem saber por quê, o espectador percebe quando o entrevistado mente, por mais razoáveis que pareçam os argumentos evocados por ele.

 [O tal João ](https://f5.folha.uol.com.br/celebridades/2018/12/festas-com-famosos-fazendas-carros-a-vida-terrena-de-joao-de-deus.shtml)que apregoava incorporar o espírito de um médico do além-túmulo, que lhe trazia a capacidade de curar enfermos, tinha o olhar em desencontro com a expressão piedosa que a fisionomia se esforçava para transmitir, fugidio, arisco, incapaz de se fixar nos olhos da repórter que o entrevistava.

 Nessa época, o homem que eu julgava safado já atraía multidões. Caravanas de crédulos do país inteiro e do exterior viajavam para [Abadiânia, no interior de Goiás](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2019/12/berco-espiritual-de-joao-de-deus-em-goias-abadiania-vira-cidade-fantasma-apos-prisao.shtml), em busca das proezas circenses que corriam de boca em boca, reforçadas por reportagens sensacionalistas que exaltavam seus vínculos extraterrenos.

 O prestidigitador que dizia curar doenças malignas com passes de mágica, que raspava córneas com o lado cego da lâmina do mesmo bisturi usado nos simulacros de cirurgias, transmitiu por décadas os vírus das hepatites B e C e sabe lá quantas infecções para os incautos, sem que a Vigilância Sanitária se dignasse a molestá-lo.

  Acreditaram que suas habilidades mediúnicas se estendiam aos vírus e às bactérias?

 [No auge da fama,](https://f5.folha.uol.com.br/celebridades/2018/12/oprah-tira-do-ar-entrevista-com-joao-de-deus-apos-acusacoes-de-abuso-sexual-contra-ele.shtml) o número de visitantes chegou a 2.000 por dia. A cidadezinha prosperou —tinha 80 pousadas que cobravam diárias de até R$ 200, restaurantes, lanchonetes, lojas que vendiam roupas brancas para os fiéis, imagens religiosas e suvenires bentos pelo santo que me passava a convicção de ser bandido.

Oncologista a vida inteira, vi surgirem vários tipos como esse, curandeiros que apregoavam trazer a saúde de volta aos desenganados, graças à intervenção de entidades extraterrenas que reencarnavam em seus corpos bem aventurados. Com a esperteza para enganar tanta gente por tanto tempo como esse tal João, entretanto, não soube de outro.

 Não faço ideia de quantos de meus pacientes caíram nesse engodo. Entendo que não se sentissem à vontade para contar ao médico descrente.

 Dos que admitiam ter ido boa parte se dizia decepcionada pela evidência dos interesses comerciais envolvidos no atendimento, enquanto outros se consideravam beneficiados pela paz emanada nas bênçãos e pela névoa de espiritualidade que acreditavam envolver o ambiente.

 O argumento de que personalidades estrangeiras, artistas de renome, intelectuais, políticos, juristas e até médicos também consultavam o benzedor travestido de médium ajudou a consolidar a fama e dar credibilidade ao golpista.

 Como é inevitável na carreira dos meliantes, no entanto, um dia a casa caiu. O jornalista Pedro Bial entrevistou [mulheres que afirmavam ter sido molestadas pelo espertalhão.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2018/12/mulheres-acusam-medium-joao-de-deus-de-abuso-sexual.shtml)

 A essas delações se juntaram centenas de outras. O ex-emissário de Deus não passava de um homem desprezível que se valia de sua posição para atacar mulheres fragilizadas por tragédias pessoais e dramas familiares.

 A credulidade, entretanto, é tão irracional que ainda há quem defenda separar o joio do trigo: de um lado, o homem e as fraquezas da carne, de outro, os poderes transcendentais das entidades que ele garantia encarnar.

 Depois de condenado a mais de 50 anos de cadeia por pequena parte de seus crimes, há devotas que teimam em visitar a hoje decadente Abadiânia, na esperança de captar eflúvios energéticos remanescentes nas instalações em que o vigarista as abençoava.

 Não me choco com a boa-fé das pessoas simplórias ludibriadas por vigaristas desse tipo, mas com os crédulos que desfrutaram o privilégio de estudar em boas escolas.

 Em pleno século 21, como podem crer em milagres, em curas mirabolantes e em personagens tão bizarros quanto esse senhor?

Amen. Thank you for also clarifying this for people. I recently saw a subreddit question that said something like ""What do you call white people who were born in Africa but moved to the United States? Are they called African Americans?"" Yes. That would actually be the correct term for them. That is not a term reserved for black Americans. It's always made me wonder why no one calls white people in the United States ""European Americans"" it's just assumed that if you're white in America you're an American no matter how many centuries or decades back your family history goes. For some reason when people ask me where I'm from the answer ""American"" doesn't suffice..doesn't matter that I was born and raised here. 

It's hard for people to understand that by ""Mexican"" the idea is that the person is of mixed Afro, indigenous and European heritage. I used to think that Sarah Shahi was indigenous but then I found out she's not. Mexico is her heritage and a big part of her culture but not necessarily her genetic makeup. It's hard for people to understand that in heavily colonized areas race and nationality are two very different things. There's a reason there's that little box  on applications and forms that says ""black hispanic"" and ""white hispanic""- being latin/hispanic isn't a race.

It makes everyone relatively wealthy very quickly (cf China as the latest example)

Once people are relatively wealthy they have fewer kids, particularly if they're no longer subsistence farmers, because you don't need children to help on the farm, but also because reduced child mortality means you need fewer children to be sure they'll take care of you in your old age. As a result the population ages.

TLDR - countries get richer then have fewer kids, not have lots of kids then get rich.

Speech in the Hague (""Europe’s Political Architecture"")

https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/108296

(It doesn't have nice soundbites like news for today so a few illustrative sentences)

Here we have a prime example of yesterday's solutions, becoming to-morrow's problems. You could extend this through the European institutions as a whole. They were meant to solve post-war problems, and did so in many ways extremely well. Looking at European institutions today, I am reminded of a remark made about political parties in the French Third Republic. **Some of them had names which reflected radical republican origins from the 1870's, but years later they had become conservative. These radical names, ran the remark, were like the light reaching Earth from stars that were long extinct.** 


A reuinited Germany can't and won't subordinate its national interests in economic or in foreign policy to those of the Community indefinitely. And sometimes Germany will be right, when the rest are wrong, as it was over the recognition of Croatia and Slovenia. Indeed, if the Federal Republic had led the way in recognising these countries earlier, Serbian aggression might have been deterred and much bloodshed prevented. Whether rightly or wrongly exercised, however, Germany's new pre-eminence is a fact. We will all be better off if we recognise that modern democratic Germany has come of age. Nevertheless **Germany's power is a problem — as much for the Germans as for the rest of Europe. Germany is too large to be just another player in the European game**, but not large enough to establish unquestioned supremacy over its neighbours. And the history of Europe since 1870 has largely been concerned with finding the right structure to contain Germany. It has been Germany's immediate neighbours, the French, who have seen this most clearly.

When the founders of the European Community drew up the Treaty of Rome, they incorporated features from two quite different economic traditions. From Liberalism they took free trade, free markets and competition. From Socialism (in guises as various as Social Catholicism and Corporatism) they took regulation and intervention. And for thirty years — up to the signing of the Single European Act — these two traditions were in a state of perpetual but unacknowledged tension. Now — with the Commission exploiting the Single European Act to accumulate powers of greater direction and regulation — Europe is reaching the point at which it must choose between these two approaches. **Is it to be a tightly-regulated, centralised bureaucratic federal state, imposing uniform standards throughout the Continent? Or is it to be a loose-knit decentralised free-market Europe of sovereign states, based upon competition between different national systems of tax and regulation within a free trade area?** Before the ink is even dry on the Maastricht Treaty, the President of the European Commission, who has always been admirably frank about his ambitions, is seeking more money and more powers for the Commission which would become the Executive of the Community, in other words a European Government. And this initiative comes on top of a Treaty that met the Commission's demand for a “single institutional structure” for the Community. **So there is no doubt what the President of the Commission is aiming at — it is a tightly centralised European federal state.**",False,False,False,,,0,1580635965,,1580638410,0,{},fg99fm1,False,t3_exiq23,False,False,t1_fg8rjh9,/r/The_Donald/comments/exiq23/leftist_subreddit_says_this_brexit_celebration/fg99fm1/,False,,1589107734,16,True,False,The_Donald,t5_38unr,r/The_Donald,restricted,0,[],

In the US, for example, 5 pounds lost doesn’t feel like much, and so when someone says they lost 5kg, it simply doesn’t instantly translate to an OMG reaction, although that’s more than 11 pounds.

Similarly, going from say 115 kilos to 99 kilos doesn’t sound dramatic to a North American, until we do the math and go, wow, that’s a nice 35 pounds lost. Any European (well, anyone using the metric system) would be suitably impressed by that change in weight, because it is a substantial number.

Starting weights, too. That 115 kilos number doesn’t instantly translate to “needs to lose weight”, because the number 115 followed by “pounds” is typically underweight unless you’re fairly short and fine boned. Again, that’s the North American perspective, anyone in the normal weight range used to thinking in metric gasps when they see a number even close to 90 kilos, far less above 100.

1. Russian economy. Most think it's awful and won't even do a cursory research on it. The truth: almost no national debt, large foreign currency and gold reserves, inflation is going down.
2. Europe's dependency on Russian natural gas. This will be a long term boon for Gazprom because the decision making IDIOTS in Europe refuse to accept nuclear power as a viable energy source (for instance, Germany is decommissioning nuclear power plants much faster than coal plants...). This leaves natural gas as more or less the only viable option. European natural gas reserves and production are shrinking, and LNG from USA can't compete in price with cheaply produced and transported russian pipeline gas.
3. Absolutely ridiculous valuation levels. The company is highly profitable even though natural gas prices are currently low. The P/E is, what, around 3? P/B something like 0.15. I also don't think that Gazprom's natural gas reserves (1/6 of the world's) are properly priced in. 
4. Many of their large pipeline projects are ready or soon to be ready. This means capital investments will be lower in the future, leaving more cash flows to be returned to investors. Gazprom has paid out a smallish dividend for a long time, but this is changing. The yield on current price will be over 10% with their new target payout ratio of 50% in a few years.
5. Sentiment. Because ""Russia is evil"" etc., the valuations are depressed. Much more so than would be sensible for any geopolitical risk present.

Ah yes, the old ""We did it before the EU/EEC existed, so we can do it again after brexit"" nonsense, which completely and utterly ignores or denies any and all changes to international arrangements which have happened over the past 30 or even 50 years. Yep, makes perfect sense. Oh wait, no - not really.....

You do have a fraction of a point: Yes, some Brits did holiday abroad before we joined the EU/EEC. Most of them were called the ""jet set"", and were composed of either the aristocracy, the idle rich, wealthy businesspeople, and perhaps part of the middle classes. All of them will still be able to do as they please, that much is true.

However, don't underestimate or ignore just how much easier travel within Europe became thanks to customs streamlining and many other transport efficiencies enabled by the EU. This didn't just make holidays easier to arrange, but a hell of a lot cheaper, which opened up the continent for a far bigger chunk of the UK population than ever before. It's no accident that demand for short and medium haul air travel skyrocketed in the 1990s.

Of course, not all of the difficulties will come flooding back straight away, but as the brexit process progresses (despite government announcements, it isn't even close to done), the EU will react to the changes we make and this will inevitably make cross-border transport more difficult Customs arrangements will become more complex, visas will be required, health insurance may become necessary - and this is a big one, because until now, filling out a simple form has effectively extended NHS provision to almost anywhere in Europe.

First of all, while we have people who are racist against black people just like everywhere else in the world, it's not as common as racism against Mexicans (or people who look Mexican). The racism isn't in your face either, if you walk in to a normal bar or something and drop the n bomb, someone will probably confront you about it and a lot of places will kick you out. However, Arizona created a bill called [SB1070](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_SB_1070#Arizona). If you take the bill at face value, it means that all immigrants must carry ID at all times and if an officer has reason to suspect someone is an illegal immigrant during a lawful stop or arrest, they can demand said ID. Now, what would lead an officer to expect someone might be an illegal alien? Could it be brown skin and an accent?  That's exactly what it was, Mexicans get treated, by policy, differently than other people by officers. So yeah, nobody will use slurs on you, but they will vote for politicians who don't mind treating minorities poorly. Looking at other states, you definitely get racists everywhere just by the law of large numbers. So I have a lot of family in Binghamton New York, which is a pretty conservative town in a pretty liberal state (very liberal, by our standards, but not by European standards). Man, I would not want to be a black person in Binghamton. I would focus all of my effort on moving away, actually. There, it's pretty open, unlike Arizona. The few black people I knew there, like my grandparent's neighbors, say they get called slurs so often, they don't even bother to engage people for it anymore. Even my grandparents (both dead) were pretty racist towards them. One time, they helped shovel snow from their driveway and, after they left, my grandma said something to the tune of ""turns out they are good for something."" My dad also came to NY from Arizona with a deeper than usual tan and my aunt said he looked like a pale \[I don't think I need to finish that sentence\]. New Orleans, since you've been there, is an odd issue. I don't know how much coverage Hurricane Katrina got where you are, but long story short, a devastating hurricane hit New Orleans and it hit black neighborhoods (yes, we still have those) the hardest. The federal government (under George W Bush) put on an absolute shit show of a recovery act and there are actually still areas that haven't fully recovered from a storm in 2005. Meanwhile, the topic of the city planning being shit became a news topic for a while and I remember a lot of people on social media (think it was MySpace around that time but I'm not positive, could have been AOL chats still) sharing a meme that says ""poor city planning? I think anyone who builds a city below sea level and fills it with \[slur\] is a damn genius!""

[],,lacertasomnium,1390890263.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_f0h74,False,False,[],"I guess since already came this far, I'll come full circle back to devilman. You said ""Delays in why a manga from the 80s wouldn't get an anime until 2010 would be because of popularity or demand for an anime of said series."" but Devilman already was popular enough to have five(!) anime adaptations and yet not a single one of them was well-known outside Japan. But now every single friend I have that has seen anime, has seen Devilman--it is literally Yuasa's most famous work despite 20+ years of him making series highly acclaimed in the anime community.

So why did this one Devilman become Netflix's biggest anime hit? Well, if you look at the changes Yuasa made, every single one is one that will make Devilman more cross-cultural. First and foremost he made Akira's adoptive father be a western man so that discrimination over being bi-racial will be a central theme to Miki's arc, in a story around humanity exterminates itself over mistrust of other humans being demons. He even placed a portait of Jesus Christ in their home so you know when the dad prays, he's praying to the western faith specifically. Internet in now central to how humanity realizes demons exist, and is also how humanity's condemn of Akira happens: internet is the literal thing that connects the world, to the point that it's how we're discussing an asian artform despite you probably being from the US and I from Mexico; in fact the majority of people read manga through the internet so it's how we can interact with asian art at all.

Finally only Yuasa's devilman has the ruffians with a heart of gold be rappers, which seems like a super random decision, until you realize that even wikipedia has an article on this: ""People who tan in order to get a darker skin complexion (especially the females, mainly those who are part of the [ganguro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganguro) subculture) are considered blackfacers. These Japanese men and women tend to embrace their assumed skin color and party with black people, especially African soldiers and Africans who have moved to Japan.[\[36\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_hip_hop#cite_note-36) The use of blackface is seen by some as a way to rebel against the culture of surface images in Japan.[\[37\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_hip_hop#cite_note-37) Blackface is used as a way to connect with African-Americans and the hegemonic racial structure that exists in the United States. Japan is seen as a homogenous and insular group, and the use of blackface shows that the youth of Japan are not only concerned with Japanese issues, but issues on a global level."" So there you go. Hip Hop in Japan is also an artform through which they announce multicultural empathy, and Yuasa made them rappers so both the western culture and the japanese culture can easily identify what they are: good people who suffer discrimination. It's a brilliant move I dare say, because they were already ""youth who is thought as evil but is just critical of their society"" in the manga 50 years ago, but this way they can not only be identified by such, but by being dedicated to an artform that is literally the defining musical artform of the USA right now despite being born out of ethnically and culturally discriminated people (black americans). That Yuasa wanted Netflix, a global distributor, and not a japanese one, just proves he was thinking about Devilman as an universal story before they even started drafting the new characters designs, and he was proven right because this is literally the only Devilman iteration out of 6 animes, a movie and multiple manga sequels to ever become mainstream.

So that is my ultimate point: shutting down discussions like this is disingenous, because it's not just ""something to humor"", it's something directors such as critical darling Yuasa sometimes think about--that ""hey, this is a story that could resonate with other cultures"", just like how Bleach which being honest kinda sucks still resonated with the west despite being panned by its own culture.

And by the way, **Pokemon is literally the highest selling franchise of not just Japan but any country to ever exist...** but here's the thing: Pokemon just stole its concept from Dragon Quest, which is drawn by Toriyama himself, so despite the fact that it's drawn by the guy who made Dragon Ball, that one didn't become a hit, because it's overtly coded in European mythos. So even being western-coded was limiting the potential of Pokemon of like I said, being the most popular thing in the entire planet, because swords and shields and knights aren't universal--but having and loving a mascot *IS* something that all cultures can identify with. Pokemon isn't just ""the most popular anime or manga"" or whatever, it literally just IS the most popular to exist on Earth, because children finding animals cute is just about the most universal thing, ever.

Here's the numbers if you want to see for yourself [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_highest-grossing\_media\_franchises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_media_franchises). Despite Disney now owning pretty much all western mainstream cinema, neither Star Wars, nor Marvel, nor any Disney Princess, is individually as globally appreciated as Pokemon is. They just had to take the western-inspired work of a japanese man and dilute both cultures so only the part about playing with cute/cool animals remained.

Mario is also a mascot that is more globally recognized than Mickey, so there you go--but the thing is that Mario is that universal neither for being italian nor for being made by japanese, but for the fact that he is a bridge between cultures: his original has him fighting Donkey Kong who is just King Kong, *despite* the fact that Japan already had their King Kong in the form of Godzilla. By putting King Kong, instead of Godzilla, it wasn't a japanese game, it was just some game about some dude who jumps and a monkey, and in consequence, that dude became the most recognizable mascot in the planet, after pikachu and hello kitty, both also japanese, neither japanese in aesthetic.",True,False,False,,,0,1580647077,,1580651614,0,{},fga5up2,True,t3_excgyh,False,True,t1_fga44qz,/r/manga/comments/excgyh/does_anyone_have_a_full_list_of_80s_manga_adapted/fga5up2/,False,,1589124490,1,True,False,manga,t5_2ql0i,r/manga,public,0,[],

It was literally a different civilization.

&gt;Did life change very much ... when the Soviet Union disbanded?

Yes, the devastation was comparable to losing in a large scale war, like a world war, and it's not even an exaggeration. The country had broken into 15 pieces, ethnic tensions emerged with some armed conflicts, people lost all of the savings they had, millions died because they couldn't adjust, life expectancy dropped from 70 to early 60s, law and order stopped working, mafia was in control of everything. Quality of life dropped to a below average third world country. At some point you had a period of 10000% yearly inflation. The average wage could be 20 dollars. Per month. In case you get lucky to actually get it, it was normal to have a delay in 2-6 month before a salary is finally paid. All of the wealth of the country that was build by generations or given by nature, like oil deposits or enormous factories, were basically given for free to a handful of questionable folks in a corruption scheme behind closed doors, which was called ""privatization"". They became billionaires and were called oligarchs. Education was of no value, high tech and most of other industries were closed, because they ""did not fit"" the market economy. A professor could work as a taxi driver, because as a professor you couldn't earn a living.

On the other hand, you could watch different kind of shows on the TV, like political shows, you were being flooded by western pop culture and cheap western goods. If you are an adventurer with flexible morals, hustling talent, willingness to take risks and ability to think outside the box and take decisions on the fly, it was a very inspiring time, unlike anything else. If you somehow had 1000 bucks in your pocket, you could do whatever you want and experience unlimited freedom (unless you upset the mafia). If you could fit, you'd be pumped up with adrenaline all day every day and feel like a king of the world, because every day everything is new again, and new opportunities open up everywhere.

It's like you are witnessing a creation of a completely new world, the world that is shit, but also has a lot of new cool stuff, and if you somehow managed to get into the swing of things, you can experience being a creator of this new world, which is quite the experience.

Maybe it was similar to how the Roman Empire collapsed, imagine a world of new opportunities.

&gt;Can you speak to have each leader of the USSR

Lenin was a political genius and started a whole thing. Via a civil war, which was a tragedy. He had innovative ideas, but didn't last long to implement all of it. Stalin was cruel, but smart in his own way, he but built a superpower and won the greatest war of all time. Khrushchev gave some freedoms, improved life of people, but had weird ideas, and was very extravagant, like Trump squared. Brezhnev was solid at start, but then became a mess (also physically). He gave stability and confidence and a period that was the best for the ordinary life, but later did nothing, the country was stagnating and there were mistakes like Afghan war. Then there was a period of old sick detached and demented rulers of which Andropov might have been competent, but was too sick. Then you have a reformer Gorbachev, who had very good intentions, but very little understanding of how the real world works, so he botched everything.

On the bright side now there is a market economy, a variation of democracy and no Iron Curtain. And no need to waste GDP and resources on supporting Eastern Europe and much of the rest of the world.

Firstly The larger the state - usually the less accountable the politicians that run it - given the fact that I haven't technically voted for the president of the EU or actually know their f*ing name without doing research on the issue is actually bizarre - Especially when they have power over us, Is direct democracy such a bad thing?

And Secondly The economy is a f*ing mess. I honestly believe the Euro to be the worst invention of the union, as it is the sole driver that has kept the big rich countries (U.k, France and Germany) in their positions of highest power - we all laugh at the racists as they say the immigrants took their jobs but did we actually stop and look at why?

United Kingdom, Germany, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands all have similar wage rates - which would be fantastic if they are the only ones in the Euro. But they are not, those mentioned have a wage of 1500-1600 EUR per Month, Look at the Eastern European countries and tell me if they are anywhere near that buying power - the short answer is nope. The highest is Poland I believe at 550 EUR. Good luck if you are buying anything in those countries from the internet - your wage is likely not going to cut it, this causes the migration.

This actually is a huge problem as most Eastern European countries are actually having decreasing populations (https://population.un.org/wpp/Maps/) 2015-2020 - the reason for this is due to the young working force doing an exodus out of those countries just to get a fairer wage - which is great if they did it by choice - but it's the system that forces them to do this.

The reason this exists is quite sinister, The more people you have to employ the less you can pay them. You could claim The Euro exists to syphon people to these countries for this reason only. 

And on another note while I'm not keyed up on economics there is another reason why you would want a lower power currency - it's better to export. If Germany was still on the Deutsche mark their currency would in my mind be stronger than the current Euro - which for a manufacturing country is bad as they want others to be able to afford their goods.

And while the last reason isn't bad per se - It isn't good either - being able to manipulate buying power isn't really an ethical decision but it's just more globalism at effect.",True,False,False,,,0,1580648845,,1580649317,0,{},fgaaeo5,False,t3_ex5633,False,True,t3_ex5633,/r/AskReddit/comments/ex5633/serious_the_uk_has_left_the_european_union_if_you/fgaaeo5/,False,,1589126746,2,True,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,r/AskReddit,public,0,[],

&amp;#x200B;

I think it helps to have a few perspectives. The first one is the comparison between a car rental, or say a construction equipment rental. 

&amp;#x200B;

Someone who buys a few cars and vans from a dealership, creates a website and office to meet customers, arranges for insurance, maintains the cars and provides a service to fix rental cars which break down, buys broken cars and repairs them to new to add value, and arranges to finance all of these activities by negotiating with various lenders, while taking on lots of personal financial risk... that's what we call an entrepreneur. And these people provide a very valuable service, short-term use of a car to people unwilling or unable, for whatever reason, to purchase a car. These could be tourists, it could be business people, people looking for a car to transport friends on a wedding, or furniture on moving day. There are many reasons why this company is valuable, and why it's a benefit to society to have these entrepreneurs. And yes, there may be shitty car rentals which you should criticise, but only because they are shitty, not just because they are car rentals.

&amp;#x200B;

Replace car rental with home rental, and nothing should change. The same can be said of stores which rent out equipment, like electric saws, nail guns, jackhammers, pumps etc. These are all valuable businesses.

&amp;#x200B;

The second perspective is that real estate investing is actually a relatively accessible field, especially in the US. In many poor countries, the finance industry is very small and unprofessional, and your financing options are loan sharks, friends or companies which charge 20% interest rates. In the US or say western europe, financing rates are very low, and there are many mortgage options backed by the government. You can get FHA loans for as little as 3.5% down. And there's real estate opportunities from $50k to $100k, needing only a few thousand dollars to start. That's money you can make driving uber in the evenings and weekends for a few months. A lot of people who criticise landlords for being a bunch of rich people extracting money from poor people, don't fully appreciate that really, virtually anyone can become a landlord, and everyone's playing roughly the same game on a level playing field. Yes there are many, many advantages to starting rich, but this is true in general, not restricted to RE, but many people started in RE being poor. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you combine these two facts: renting homes is a valuable service just like renting cars, and not just merely exploitation, and anyone can become a landlord, there's no permanent 'owner class' and 'renter class' that will forever remain the same, it's hard to feel guilty.

&amp;#x200B;

Third and last point, is that those who see landlords through a disproportionately negative light (exploiters, monsters etc), often propose policy measures which are detrimental to the renters long-term. There's a pretty strong economic consensus for example that far-reaching rent-control has many adverse effects, particularly to the extents these people propose. I'm certainly in favour of some rent-controlled real estate, tenant rights and landlord duties, but in general I think most states get this right, while those who are most vocal about their anti-landlordism, make policy proposals that go too far and actually hurt renters. As such, I don't think it is useful for anyone, even non-landlords, to be anti-landlord. For example, in my country there is a severe lack of construction despite huge housing shortages, in part because the government mandates a large portion of construction goes to rent-controlled units. By limiting the construction revenues by law, while not limiting the construction costs, it's becoming less interesting to build. This is hurting buyers and renters and creating bigger shortages. It also means that those with rent-controlled units got lucky, and are paying a subsidised below market-rate, while new entrants have to rent at now inflated market rates due to the shortage. Rent controlled units have become a lottery for the lucky few, while the rest are screwed. And no new construction is going up. Even if you think being anti-landlord is a proper view, it still typically wouldn't be lead to the best policy outcomes for regular citizens.",True,False,False,,,0,1580649505,,False,0,{},fgac3kr,False,t3_exc5ca,False,True,t3_exc5ca,/r/Landlord/comments/exc5ca/landlord_us_do_you_ever_feel_guilty_about_being_a/fgac3kr/,False,,1589127558,1,True,False,Landlord,t5_2qpqt,r/Landlord,public,0,[],

In europe transdermal estrogen is very common and trans women don't start out with oral estrogen but do just fine with it.

To answer your question, no it’s not xenophobic. With over a million people walking into Europe, where were the background checks? Were all of these people specifically from the war zone? Were all of them specifically from Syria? At the time nobody knew for sure - there was also a lot of folks coming over from North Africa at the time who were part of that migrant column and they were not fleeing anything.

Like I said before, context is everything and in the context of what had been happening in Europe a year or so before and then right after the migrant crisis I have zero criticism of people who didn’t want people from the Middle East showing up in Europe, whatever their reasons. 

I’m amazed you show absolutely no sympathy for the concerns of Europe’s citizens in this regard and only choose to demonise the ones who put their hand up to object, and at that for probably no other reason than virtue signalling.

A few years ago, there was a wave of hate crime hoaxes against Jewish centers.

Over 1,000 anti-Jewish threat phone calls were made. Bomb threats and other types of threats.

[JCC Threat-Makers: 2 Years, 1,000 Calls](https://www.timesofisrael.com/jcc-bomb-threat-suspect-reportedly-behind-over-1000-calls/)

Turns out that 2 Israeli Jews were paid in bitcoin to create this wave of hate crime hoaxes.

[JCC Threat-Makers “Paid with Bitcoin”](http://newobserveronline.com/jew-jcc-threat-makers-paid-bitcoin/)

No law enforcement has determined who paid them. But who benefited?

A very likely suspect is the ADL (Anti-Defamation League).

This wave of over 1,000 hate crime hoaxes was used by the ADL to raise huge amounts of money.

The ADL also used it as a pretext to pressure Amazon to ban a bunch of books on Holocaust Revisionism.

source:

https://codoh.com/library/document/5330/

When the Israeli Jews were caught, the ADL blamed the bomb threats on ""white hate"" rather than a Jewish hate crime hoax.

[ADL: Israeli Jew’s Bomb Threats against American Jews are “White Hate”](http://newobserveronline.com/adl-counts-jews-162-bomb-threats-against-jews-as-white-hate-crime/)

So that's the current world. There's so little **real** anti-Jewish hatred that the Jewish Supremacists have to manufacture it with fake ""anti-semetic"" hate crime hoaxes.

But what about the reverse? What's the state of Jewish hatred against whites?

Here's an American rabbi preaching that God has given Jews a mission to ""fix the world""? 

But what happens to people who don't want their country to be ""fixed"" by Jews? Exterminate! Every man, woman, child, and even the babies must be genocided.

This rabbi specifically states that the countries that must be genocided are America and most of europe (white majority countries)

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/dtx7zi/exterminate_an_american_rabbi_says_god_had_given/f6z9jbl?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x

Also, here's more Jewish Supremacists saying that

[white genocide of Europe is fullfillment of Jewish prophecy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrP9ysKbtIs)

and [when Israel has the Power...all Christians will be killed because they are idolator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJRZkqYkJOM)

Of course, these Jewish Supremacists pays no penalty for promoting genocide of white majority countries. Why not?

You aren't allowed to discuss or protest when Jewish Supremacists express genocidal hatred of white gentiles (non-Jews).

It's one of the many signs that we live under a SJS (System of Jewish Supremacy)

But most people don't know this, because the concept of [""White Supremacy"" is used as camouflage to cover up the fact that we actually live in a System of Jewish Supremacy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/d4al5e/why_do_universities_push_the_myth_that_black/f0alnsj/?context=3)

&gt;Then again, so are you in this very thread so it probably doesn't even need to be said.

I actually liked Bernie back around 2016. He wasnt that bad a guy and seemed sensible enough but he lost my respect the second he let BLM supporters kick him off his own podium at one of his events and proceeded to let everyone walk all over him ever since. He is a decent honest guy but he surrounds himself with lunatics and will bend to their will on every issue. He seemed great and now I just see his weakness. I would love to see if he could win but he wont be given the chance and thats what I said was sad. You can see that as attacking both if you want but ultimately Im far more against the DNC than I could be against Bernie. I see him more as a grandad being taken advantage of by his younger relatives with how his campaign is being run. And of course the DNC is the shifty developer trying to get him put in a home so he will sell his house to them.
