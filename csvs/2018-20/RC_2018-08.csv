And while the [EU is not perfect](https://theconversation.com/how-democratic-is-the-european-union-59419) it [provides value for people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union). 

Calling it a democratic deficit seems an understatement. 

While, Sure, it has some value, for instance, As a Norwegian i just last month enjoyed not needing my passport when driving to visit Sweden.

But at the EU grows, the corruption will grow with it, and there is no democratic way to counter that corruption, because the demos has no power over who writes the laws. And as pre-revolutionary France learned so painfully. What good is having representation in parlament, when only the king can propose laws?

The EU has also done a lot of harm, Take German coal. Because of EU rules, at a point through the year, German power plants are forced to stop using German coal, because German coal is so clean and efficient, using it is seen as unfair to other coal producing countries like Poland and Greece. So Germans are forced to stop using the coal they have on storage right next to the power plants, and spend a fortune transporting even more expensive coal all the way from Greece. 

That is just one example of the insane government bureaucracy that is the EU. [and it is getting worse. ](https://www.ft.com/content/658bd8e0-c91d-11e5-be0b-b7ece4e953a0)

More than once the EU commission, the only ones who can actually propose laws, [has been deemed so corrupt, the entire commission was forced to resign. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santer_Commission) And mind you, the Parlament wanted to make what they did a crime, but because said corrupt commission refused to write a law banning their blatant corruption, nothing will **ever** happen. As opposed to the US, where you could simply vote on a senator who would propose that bill, and then have the people vote out anyone who voted no. 

The EU does not just suffer from a democratic deficit, it is fundamentally undemocratic.

&gt;And while I'm in favor of the EU, I'm not advocating for it as a model for anything in America. Except to say that Trump is [definitely anti-EU](https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:eco,w_634/https://inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/farage-1.jpg) and therefore against internationalism and more in [favor of closing borders.](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/05/politics/donald-trump-border-wall-close-country-remark/index.html)

* [**Young Adult Psychological Outcome After Puberty Suppression and Gender Reassignment**](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958). A clinical protocol of a multidisciplinary team with mental health professionals, physicians, and surgeons, including puberty suppression, followed by cross-sex hormones and gender reassignment surgery, provides trans youth the opportunity to develop into well-functioning young adults. All showed significant improvement in their psychological health, and they had notably lower rates of internalizing psychopathology than previously reported among trans children living as their natal sex. **Well-being was similar to or better than same-age young adults from the general population.**

* The only disorders more common among trans people are those associated with abuse and discrimination - mainly anxiety and depression. Early transition [**virtually eliminates these higher rates of depression and low self-worth**](http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567%2816%2931941-4/fulltext), and [**dramatically improves trans youth's mental health**](https://thinkprogress.org/allowing-transgender-youth-to-transition-improves-their-mental-health-study-finds-dd6096523375#.pqspdcee0).

The Heir to the Empire trilogy reignited the EU in the 90s and because of the state of the galaxy post-ROTJ, a lot of the major stories had to be about our heroes “governing well” and the challenges that come with that. Imo these types of stories naturally gravitate more towards sci-fi and technical explanations than fantasy and space opera. After the 90s, we had the prequels, which had the same general setting. Our heroes are governing and the challenges that come with that are what a lot of the PT era EU is about. It makes sense. Its not a dark age of lost knowledge. It’s the Jedi at the height of their power (PT era) and the Jedi rebuilt into a formidable power (post-ROTJ Legends material).


The ST was a bit of a soft reboot to ANH Galactic status quo of Rebels vs Empire, complete with our heroes NOT governing, and a lost and forgotten Jedi order. So naturally, once the decision to make the ST a soft reboot (politically) was finalized, it makes sense that it would hew a lot more closely to the mystical fantasy/space opera than sci-fi.


That said, if Episodes 10-12 do ever happen, I doubt many people (myself included) would let slide a SECOND soft reboot back to Rebels vs Empire. 10-12 should be about our heroes governing, and that may make things a bit more like Star Trek, which I’m not totally opposed to.

The general instability of a number of countries in Latin America was an awkward problem, with several of them having recently gone through revolution, if not then caught in the middle of civil war themselves. Venezuela, Colombia, and Bolivia were all in the midst of political instability, with governments elevated by coup or revolution, and while having no desire to alienate them, for the US to recognize them might give unintended moral aid to the Confederacy. The biggest example is in Caracas. When the American Consul Henry T. Blow, arrived in Venezuela in November 1861, as instructed he declined to present his credentials to Gen. Paez, who recently had overthrown the legally elected President, but did his best to maintain good social relations. A year later, his replacement, Erastus D. Culver, however had no instructions and chose to recognize the Paez government, which forced Seward to repudiate his actions in a tip-toeing communication about the United States not 'intervening in domestic disputes', and creating a fairly tense situation between the Consul and the government, only finally resolved after a peace treaty, and eventual new constitution, was signed in 1864, allowing credentials to be (again) presented with Washington's blessing.

To be sure, some, at least, saw opportunities in Union weakness. Francisco Solano López, the dictator of Paraguay, for instance, put out feelers to France in 1862 about the possibility of French support for himself to be crowned, although this came to nothing when he in turn learned that French plans might be for monarchy, but most certainly excluded him. Likewise in Ecuador, Catholic Monarchists led by recently elevated President Gabriel García Moreno, had already been plotting with France since 1859, seeking a possible French protectorate over the country, and likely continued to do so through 1862, seeing their assistance as a necessary bulwark against the Liberals.

And further, while they might have been in the minority, and it is clear enough that practical concerns gave most of Latin America little reason for anything other than support of the Union, it can't be said that the support was *immediate*. In the first phase of the war, much of the press in South America was in fact not pro-Union, as the papers were heavily dependent on British/French dispatches, which were often quite sympathetic to the Confederacy. Both driven by popular Liberal sentiment, as well as the very real threats materializing from Spanish and French actions, news coverage would shift, and by 1863, was decidedly more pro-Union. Commendatory celebrations of the 4th of July appeared in a number of papers - unimaginable several years earlier - and further, the national bands of Argentina and Chile both performed outside the American embassies as well.

In final evaluation, it is likely that based on pure sentiment, Latin America would have, for the most part, found themselves more favorable towards the Union than the Confederacy. The traditions of Republicanism and Liberalism predisposed them towards the United States and its cause of Union, while strong anti-slavery sentiment additionally ensured support the cause of abolition, even prior to its establishment as a principle aim of the war. Nevertheless, the European powers, principally Spain and France, all but ensured that they would see no other choice but to root for American success, and following that, the resumption of American protection. Preexisting resentments were not entirely erased, to be sure, but no stronger case could be made for the *value* of a strong United States and the Monroe Doctrine than the brief view of just what it meant to lack those.

Why? Wikipedia distributes and ""consumes"" knowledge on a world-wide scale, without charging quid-pro-quo fees.

I'm challenging Adam Smith's assertion at the beginning of The Wealth of Nations that if Farmer A has a surplus of something Farmer B does not want to trade his goods for, there can be no exchange until you create a currency.

Why can't Farmer B give his surplus as Farmer A asks? That is what the Fed does for banks, supplying liquidity on demand without loss because they have an unlimited surplus and no personal profit motive. The Fed and the Board of Governors are working in the public interest ...

&gt; Are you arguing that large-scale trade is somehow bad?

I'm saying it can occur without money, or with unlimited money (as now, because finance allows unlimited funding sources). Best would be for individual to trade much as you and I are right now exchanging ideas, with no currency changing hands between us.

&gt; Wampum had some currency-like properties even before the Europeans arrived and it became more of a currency later.

I think you are imposing an interpretation on pre-settler Wampum. So am I, but why should your story be better than mine? I try to get away in nature, immerse myself in it as the native Americans of this region must have done, and the ability to live without thinking of costs is invigorating.

&gt; that doesn't mean that the precursor to money isn't there.

It doesn't mean it is there, either. A mountain stream is always on, no currency is needed to drink from it. You don't have to trade or labor under a boss for money to buy food, you get it yourself or others give it to you.

&gt; As outsiders, we might look at a small-scale society and fail to see explicit quid-pro-quo exchanges, but that doesn't mean that the underlying quid-pro-quo isn't implicitly there.

You are telling stories. I'm telling a different story. Why should I believe your story?

&gt; Small scale societies often have rituals for abandoning/sacrificing people who are not able to contribute to the good of the tribe.

You fail to account for the Jains, for whom self-starvation is the best death possible.

It all started with Ansel Keys. he was wrong. See Sources section. 


They can only ever show association, not causation. And they can't differentiate between people who eat low carb/high fat but live clean lives vs people who eat high fat/high carb and who smoke, drink, etc. 


Fat is incredibly important to the human body. You can live without carbs. You cannot live without fat. 

In general, vegans take pretty good care of themselves. The same cannot be said for the majority of people who eat a lot of saturated fat. 

But when you replace carbs with fat, what you're doing is swapping one energy source for another. You're using a different metabolic pathway (ketone bodies). There is no evidence that saturated fat is harmful in this context. 

And for most people, dietary cholesterol does not equal high cholesterol in the blood. 

BTW, cholesterol is extremely important for a number of reasons. Low cholesterol is *not* a good thing, and it can cause heart failure. The french have the highest average cholesterol in Europe, around 250, but the lowest incidence of heart disease. 

------

The vegan diet can be healthy *if* the person understands that they are likely to run into at least a few nutritional deficiencies down the road and plans accordingly. Now, to me, that doesn't sound like a good diet, but that's just me. B12, V2, Omega fatty oils, calcium etc can all become issues.

&gt; Silversun Pickups is a Grammy-nominated American indie rock band which formed in Los Angeles, California, United States in 2005. The band consists of Brian Aubert (vocals, guitar), Nikki Monninger (bass, vocals), Joe Lester (keyboards) and Christopher Guanlao (drums).  The band members are friends who had played together previously or in mutual friends' bands. 

&gt; The name Silversun Pickups refers to a liquor store across the road L.A. rock-scene hang Silverlake Lounge. One of the band’s friends would often arrive at the store late at night to buy liquor, and would be as such making the ""Silversun Pickup"". 

&gt; The band is signed to Dangerbird Records. They released their debut EP ""Pikul"" in July of 2005. The band has released four albums,  2006's ""Carnavas"", 2009's ""Swoon"", 2012's ""Neck of the Woods"" and 2015's ""Better Nature"". The band managed two Top 10 singles on Billboard's Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart in 2007: ""Lazy Eye"" (#5) and ""Well Thought Out Twinkles"" (#9). In 2009, they managed their third top 10 on the chart, ""Panic Switch"" (#1)  and a fourth song ""Substitution"" was also on that chart (#23).

&gt; Silversun Pickups have been compared to The Smashing Pumpkins (possibly due in part to Brian Aubert's vocal style) and 90's shoegazing bands like My Bloody Valentine, Lush, Ride, and Slowdive. Silversun Pickups claim they have been heavily influenced by Modest Mouse and The Velvet Underground as well as other lesser-known acts.

&gt; Their first break came when a friend mailed a boombox demo to CMJ and they were accepted. They got their start in many of the most important L.A. clubs and began to draw a strong following upon the release of the Pikul EP. This culminated in frequent touring, including a co-headlining stint with Viva Voce.

&gt; The band finished a three-week tour opening for Australian rockers Wolfmother on December 9, 2006, and have toured with OK Go and Snow Patrol on their U.S. spring tour, which ended on April 10, 2007. The Pickups played at the Coachella Music Festival in Indio, California on April 27, 2007.

&gt; The band supported Foo Fighters, along with Nine Inch Nails on August 21st 2007 as part of the 'T on the Fringe' music festival in Edinburgh, Scotland, and then on the 22nd in Marley Park, Dublin, Ireland. They also performed at the Carling Reading and Leeds festivals on the 25th/26th August 2007 and supported Kaiser Chiefs on their Autumn European tour and Snow Patrol on their tour of Australia (with Paolo from Snow Patrol joining them regularly to play guitar on Lazy Eye and Nikki guesting on vocals for Snow Patrol's Set The Fire To The Third Bar onstage). On some of these dates the band have been covering Joy Division's Shadowplay and Bjork's Big Time Sensuality, both of which have been recorded for web or radio sessions.

&gt; The second full studio album, entitled ""Swoon"", was released 14th April 2009 in both the US and UK.

&gt; The band was also part of Lollapalooza 2009 in Chicago, IL, Voodoo Fest 2009 and 2012  in New Orleans, and the 2009 Sasquatch! Festival.

&gt; In early 2010, they supported the UK anthem-rock superstars Muse for several of their North American dates for The Resistance tour. Read more on Last.fm.

After 18 months of anticipation, the Treasury Department released on Tuesday a seminal report examining the barriers to financial technology and innovation in the United States and proposing a sweeping set of recommendations designed to cut red tape and foster continued experimentation.


While the report only mentions cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies in passing, many of the current problems it highlights and recommendations it proposes are highly germane to the crypto industry and nonbank financial entities of all stripes.


These include calls for the streamlining of complex and convoluted financial regulation frameworks for activities such as money transmission and payments, and for further implementation of fintech regulatory sandboxes, such as those that have been successfully deployed in places like the United Kingdom, Singapore and Hong Kong internationally, as well as Arizona in the U.S. - which will officially launch on August 1.


“Financial regulation should be modernized to more appropriately address the evolving characteristics of financial services of today and in the future,” the report states, emphasizing:


It goes on to specifically recommend that “the states work to harmonize money transmitter requirements for licensing and supervisory examinations.”


Money transmission licensing rules have been a perpetual thorn in the side of cryptocurrency companies operating in the U.S., as the activity is regulated on a state-by-state basis and no license passporting structure exists as it does in places like the European Union.


Treasury also noted that blockchain, distributed ledger technologies and digital assets are being separately examined in interagency fashion by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a group which was established after the 2008 Financial Crisis as a forum for convening federal financial regulators around issues of systemic importance.


The report was commissioned via executive order by President Donald Trump shortly after he took office in February 2017 with the purpose of constructing a series of recommendations for making the U.S. financial system more nimble, competitive and capable of embracing and incubating new technologies.


Concerns Being Heard


The core theme of the 222 page report is that more governmental support for innovators and entrepreneurs is required across the board, and that Treasury is keen provide that push when necessary within the regulatory ranks


“Support of innovation is critical across the regulatory system — both at the federal and state levels,” the report states. “Treasury supports encouraging the launch of new business models … to pursue innovative technologies to lower costs, improve customer outcomes, and improve access to credit and other services.”


It introspectively reckons that many current financial regulation structures are outdated given the changing pace of technology, and that this dynamic could squeeze out innovation that could potentially benefit consumers and businesses:


Sandbox Solutions


Another carrying theme from the report is that of fostering “agile governance,” or an approach to regulation “that can evolve with innovation.” One battle-tested way of doing this internationally has been through the use of regulatory sandboxes that provide a safe space for companies to experiment with new products and allow regulators and entrepreneurs to learn side-by-side with one another.


“Treasury recommends that federal and state financial regulators establish a unified solution that coordinates and expedites regulatory relief under applicable laws and regulations to permit meaningful experimentation for innovative products, services, and processes,” the report states.


“Such efforts would form, in essence, a ‘regulatory sandbox’ that can enhance and promote innovation,” it continues, urging Congress to step in with a legislative solution if financial regulators and individual states are unable to achieve such an objective.


These types of laboratories will be critical for bringing the U.S. financial technology scene back to par with other countries that have been quicker out of the gate and have less inertia embedded in their regulatory schemes.


“Innovation has played a factor in making the U.S. capital markets the largest, deepest, and most vibrant in the world and has been of critical importance in supporting the U.S. economy,” the report finds, concluding:

I'm still trying to wrap my head around the ethical conundrum of sovereignty/independence for so many African countries, and how Europe doesn't seem to bear any explicit responsibility for the present condition of the continent.

On one hand, obviously a nation formed from imperialist slavery deserves independence way before it demands it. On the other hand, how do you ethically give a nation independence when the vast majority of its populace is uneducated (because the reigning powers intentionally left them uneducated)?

I have studied the history of the DRC pretty extensively. One fact that still leaves me floored is that–when the Democratic Republic of the Congo finally demanded and subsequently achieved independence in 1960, there were only a *handful* of natives with college degrees. I've read some sources which say 12 people, in the entire country, had college educations. Some say 30 people. Some estimate that it was about ~60 people. Regardless, how do you ethically hand power and democracy to such a population, especially with a staggeringly small amount of educated population?

Not to mention the meddling of USSR's KGB and USA's CIA–who are definitely on record as meddling with the political installment of the kleptocratic dictator that reigned for the following 37 years...

But let me give my rebuttal.

Many of those countries have some pretty strict consumer protection laws. Compare that to the states. Example is in that European countries have some strict privacy laws for consumers, making businesses protect consumer info. Here in the states, we rely on individual states to make laws doing that, with some states saying ""eh if the consumers info gets out there it's their own fault"".

That step by step would work in a perfect world, but we don't live in a perfect world where both sides of the aisle will work with one another. Maybe like 20 years ago we'd have an actual chance at that, but currently we don't. Hence why the Trump admin has been gutting the ACA where they can for no reason beyond the obvious ""because we can"". And that step by step would also work wonders if the price of care, both for visits, surgery, medication, etc wasn't constantly rising. But because prices constantly rise, the knee jerk reaction is ""NO YOURE DESTROYING THE MARKET"" when in reality the market is destroying itself.

I have no idea what you're talking about here, because I never mentioned any polls saying the majority want Medicare for all. Hell I didn't mention polls at all.

&gt;Venomous snakes generally dont try to hide the fact that they're venomous. They use bright colors and high contrast to warn other animals that they're dangerous, 

the vast majority of the most venomous snakes in Australia (the brown snakes, mulga snake, both taipans, lowland copperheads, death adder) are neither bright or high contrast, they vary from shades of brown to yellow, grey, reddish or black, colours that are unsurprisingly *suitable for their habitats*.  
same goes for rattle snakes. or the common European adder. or the four mambas (three of them are bright green, but they do live in bright green trees in tropical Africa).  
there's *a lot* of snakes that are hard to spot in their natural habitats. 

&gt;Also, more triangular/diamond shaped heads (vs the sleek shape of non-venomous snakes heads) are very good indicators of a venomous snake. Snakes venom glands are situated on the sides of their heads, giving them a distinct head shape. 

this statement is kinda true but also extremely problematic as it only addresses a part of the venomous snakes, i.e. vipers like rattle snakes. on the other hand, a non triangular head shape gives you *zero* information about a snakes venomousness.  
take a look at most of the Australian snakes I just mentioned, like the [eastern brown snake](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Eastern_Brown_Snake_-_Kempsey_NSW.jpg). or the [inland taipan](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Fierce_Snake-Oxyuranus_microlepidotus.jpg/800px-Fierce_Snake-Oxyuranus_microlepidotus.jpg). here's the [green mamba](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Dendroaspis_viridisPCCA20051227-1885B.jpg).

Yes, that's exactly what I mean with ""interested"". Able and willing. Maybe should have been more precise.

&gt; No, I'm not assuming there would be only one. But why exactly would another one want to fight with them--it would be far more convenient to simply join forces together. Because what is the second PMC getting by opposing them? Money? Because they would get that by joining up with other PMC group as well.

That's an unproven assumption on your part. You are assuming a cartel-like behavior, but there aren't many good practical examples of functional cartels. Just as union strikes are generally broken by scabs that stand to win if they do, cartels have deserters and competitors that stand to win if they don't adhere to the cartel. Most all known cases of cartel behavior did not work because of this. Other PMCs would have a lot to win, from simple reputation (which is terribly important in the market, see how yelp reviews can ruin a business reputation and force it out of the market), to lots of clients and money. Undercutting the competition is one of the main ways of winning clients.

So, based on history and how people are, I beg to differ.

&gt; There would be a vacuum of power in an ancap society which would encourage groups to come along and try to seize that power which would then effectively make them the state at that point.

A vacuum of power only emerges when a State apparatus is left headless. That's how Bolsheviks got to control Russia, by taking over the existing State apparatus created by the monarchy. One can look at Somalia to more or less see what happens if there is no functional State apparatus to take over. Is the more stateless parts there they don't have a power vacuum, instead they have tribal rule. And trying to impose a State over a group of people that don't have one already there is much harder that simply taking over an existing one as the Bolsheviks did. When the Spanish conquered the Inca, they also did exactly that. But they could not do that with the stateless mapuche people, in fact they could not conquer them. The mapuche resisted european (and later Chilean State) rule for some 400 years, all while being stateless, and likely because of it, as the would-be conquerors had no State apparatus to seize.

&gt; ...Ah yes, because the small towns of several thousand people are going to have tanks and warships at their disposal...jesus christ dude.

American Revolution. Many towns had cannons and military-grade weapons, privately owned. Many americans had privately-owned warships. All military-grade for the time. I don't see the difficulty there. Are you forgetting that they would have the money that would otherwise be taken as taxes at their disposal? That's a lot of extra money people right now don't have because the State takes it away. A quick estimate would be that people would have double the income or even more. In most countries the States deprive people of at least half of what they produce, usually more.

&gt; I don't have to explain why that is the case. Go look at history. Whenever their is a power vacuum groups always try and move in to grab said power.

I look at history and I don't see mercenaries trying to take over places like Venice or Florence or the Hanseatic League cities. On the contrary, I see mercenaries mostly honoring their contracts with them, and the more reputable companies having more financial success. I lots of other cases I don't see what you say.

Playing on Android

This should go without saying: I'm active every day and can deliver:

the maximum amount of tokens every season.

a finished prestige cup every season.

1.5m-3.0m RP/season (depending on my spare time and the usual struggle to play live races on android).

What critical thinking have you engaged in to separate propaganda by the victor against a belligerent in a war from objective fact?

&gt;Could you, as a challenge, justify the Nazi's extermination even if the number, as you claim, is inflated?

The evidence I've seen up to this time has not conclusively shown that the Nazis intended to exterminate the Jews.  There is plenty of evidence that many Germans intensely disliked Jews (like most Europeans)—and for understandable and in some cases perhaps justifiable reasons (diasporic people tend to be dishonest toward their hosts, because they continuously pick up and leave, similar to gypsy con artists)—and that the Nazis were going to deport them to another land where they could have their own nation, but there is not but the sparsest of evidence they intentionally genocided them, which is why the Nuremberg trials, the sham that they were, relied on the postulation that the Nazis engaged in euphemisms to carry it out.

What I think probably happened was the Germans were going to deport them, then a major war was forced on them and their economy and military were not entirely ready for it—and neither was the deportation program of the Jews.  The Allies bombed German supply lines to nothing and it had a significant effect on both German civilians and Jewish civilians.  There's testimony by one Jewish inmate that the Nazi camp officials didn't have much food either.

The Germans were in a tight spot (had continuously been in a tight spot since the close of WW1) and used forced labor as an expedient.  Along with many of the German civilians and soldiers who died from starvation and typhus, many of these Jewish inmates did as well, and the number was probably more around 200k-300k, not 1 million, 3 million, or 6 million.  The logistics of those camps could not process so high of numbers.

&gt;I feel like you're taking a very rosy eyed view of the Nazis

Not at all.  I'm sure a number of their leadership were psychopaths, as tends to be the case (tell me with a straight face Anglo-American leadership wasn't also filled with psychopaths, being that they just forced a war that would killing millions of people and all for marginal benefits to business) and I'm sure some Jews were in fact murdered, but those murders would be spontaneous events, like the suppression of resistance cells in Poland or revenge for the murder of a German official, and such events are quite common in history.

&gt;Maybe a simpler way to get at the heart of my confusion would be to ask from which standpoint are you making these arguments? Are you a Nazi sympathizer?

I'm primarily being a critical thinker with regard to Anglo-American culture.  I don't think we were the good guys at all.  We didn't know about concentration camps (and had our own concentration camps back home of the Japanese), even if you believe all the propaganda that's been written about them (much of it by Soviet liars).

The initiation of the war was based on paper-thin arguments and it's why there was a post-war indirect framing using the Holocaust that we were liberators and that the German people were oppressed by the Nazi regime (they were not, as postwar polling showed and which you're probably never told about in school).

It would be incredibly rare for these things to go from good guy-bad guy to bad guy-good guy.

While Syrians who have stayed in the country between 5 and 15 years don’t stand out as a singular case, they are still the fourth lowest-ranked country by employment rate for both men and women. The situation for Somalis looks particularly problematic, with only 32.03 % of working-age men and 23.06 % of working-age women being in employment after at least 5 years of residence in the country. Almost all Muslim-majority countries have very low female employment rates; this is even true for the groups with the longest presence in the country such as Pakistanis (34.56%), Morocco (41.27%), and Turkey (44.76%). Somali, Iraqi, Syrian, Lebanese, and Afghani women all have employment rates below 40 %. The most telling results are those where a group has a low employment rate combined with a high benefits rate. People may stay outside of the labor market for a range of reasons, and by doing so they are not eligible for benefits; many non-natives who marry a Dane fall into this category, for example.

I think Liverpool will be the toughest opponent, if we win the league again this year it won't be as easy as last season and definitely the margin will be less than 19 points. 
Liverpool had a problem a problem of fucking up against lesser team and waste a lot of easy points. The signing of Alisson and the comeback of Nathaniel Clyne will strengthen their defense alot. On the other hand the signing of Shaqiri will give them offensive depth as well as diversity on their style of play. Fabinho and Keita are very strong defensive and offensive options either in recovering the ball or building up the attack. Their midfield lacks a bit of creativity but is balanced with the high intensity and energy they use in their style of play and pressing 
Predicted league position: 2nd

2.*Chelsea*
My perception of Kanté as a player is he's amazing in any defensive style of play and he'd be amazing in any offensive team like Liverpool. But I'm never convinced he'll do good in Guardiola's team for example or -My guess- Sarri's team he's too slow on the ball, very bad passing range and not too much accuracy in passing or chance creation and that's why they signed Jorginho, if you play Kanté in a more advanced position you'll lose a big part of the chance creation. Honestly I don't know how this will end up for Kanté, you can't sell a player like that and you can't play him in a system like Sarri's. 
I think Chelsea will take a bit of time but they'll have an amazing season reaching a points tally north of 80 but not winning the league as they'll struggle against us and Liverpool and probably winning 50% against Arsenal and United. 
They're not going to sell any of their star players and Hazard/Barkley to shine and have a huge season. 
Predicted league position: 3rd-4th

3.*Arsenal*
Arsenal are going through an unexpected and a very interesting project. 
I really don't have much to say about Arsenal but if you play fantasy premier league I suggest you invest in AUBAMAYANG. The guy looks scary tbh probably scoring 20+ with Ozil And mkhitaryan supplying chance after chance. They have a very good squad but I'll wait to see them in our game which I really don't know how hard it will be on us
Predicted league position: 3rd-4th

4.*Man Utd*
I think the problem in Man United team is not the squad. They have a very good set of players that can play amazingly like we've seen in the world cup. But their problem will be in the tactics and style of play that mourinho chooses for the team. Last season they played 9 preseason games and started the season ln a very good form and that helped them edge the teams that started slowly and were not very ready in terms of fitness levels and united had a very good fixture list last season. One more thing is Wenger and Conte were pure fuckups last season which is not the case this one so I think this will be harsh on United
Predicted league position: 5th

5.*Spurs*
I hafe nothing to say😂
I don't think they'll go through the transfer season without signing a single player. There must be someone in their mind and they're waiting for the right moment to start negotiating. Tbh they have a fairly good squad which is capable of putting pressure on the league winner but never surpass him. Thing is everyone around them is evolving and they're still in the same place which will cause them problems this season unless they're going to sign someone or change their tactics a little they'll be the same as last season but everyone around them is not the same that's why they fall in position.
Predicted league position: 6th



Teams I think will show good character this season:

-Everton: good signings in Richarlison and Lucas Digne and they already have a good squad. Marco Silva can do us a surprise and reach European football this season.

-Westham: With the signing of Yarmolenko, Jack Wilshire and Filipe Anderson. Manuel Pellegrini have a very good squad in his hands to have a good season and finish in top 10 at least if not reach the Europa league.

-Fulham: What is really happening guys? They give me the impression they very easily convince De Bruyne to join them 😅
Top 10 finish expected.

Wall of text that may be interesting about jurisdiction

&gt;An individual is domiciled in England if they are (i) resident in the jurisdiction and (ii) the nature and circumstances of their residence indicate a substantial connection with the jurisdiction. The English Courts have held that an individual can be resident in multiple jurisdictions. This may be the case where a defendant has business interests in multiple jurisdictions and spends periods of time in each. The English Court will consider all of the circumstances when deciding whether an individual is resident in this jurisdiction. The fact that a defendant owns a property in England is, on its own, unlikely to be sufficient. The claimant must show that there is a good arguable case that the property is the defendant's settled or usual place of abode (i.e. where they live). A degree of permanency is required. The English Court is likely to take into account factors such as whether the defendant's family lives at the property and the number of nights the defendant has spent at that property in recent years, compared to nights spent in other jurisdictions. It is also likely to consider the portion of the defendant's business interests that are in this jurisdiction, compared to other jurisdictions.

&gt;The English Court will automatically have jurisdiction over a defendant who is domiciled outside the European Union if the defendant can be served with the claim form while in England. This includes where papers are served on an individual who is only visiting the jurisdiction. However, in these circumstances the defendant can argue that the English Court should not exercise its jurisdiction if there is a more appropriate forum (known as the doctrine of ""forum non conveniens"").

&gt; If the defendant cannot be served while in England, the claimant will need to obtain the English Court's permission to serve the claim form outside the jurisdiction.  In order to obtain permission, the claimant will have to show (in relation to each cause of action which forms part of the claim) that: (1) there is a serious issue to be tried in relation to the foreign defendant (i.e. the claim must have a real prospect of success); (2) there is a good arguable case that the claim falls within one or more of the ""jurisdictional gateways"" set out in the Civil Procedure Rules; and (3) England is clearly the appropriate forum for the case and the Court ought to exercise its discretion to permit service of the proceedings out of the jurisdiction.

&gt; One of the ""jurisdictional gateways"" relates to claims in tort where the damage was sustained within the jurisdiction or resulted from an act committed within the jurisdiction. For example, if an English bank is induced to lend money to a borrower abroad by misrepresentations, the damage can be said to have been sustained in this jurisdiction, as the loan was advanced in England.

&gt; Another gateway is where the dispute relates to a contract which is governed by English law or contains a term conferring jurisdiction on the English Courts to determine any claim in respect of the contract.

&gt; Another useful gateway in fraud litigation is the ""necessary or proper gateway"". If one defendant is served (either in England or with the Court's permission pursuant to one of the other jurisdictional gateways), then the claimant can obtain permission to serve the claim form on another person outside the European Union who is a necessary or proper party to the claim. This gateway can be very useful in fraud litigation where there are often a number of defendants based in different jurisdictions.

&gt; When considering if the English Court is clearly the appropriate forum for the dispute to be determined, the factors the English Court may consider are wide, and include: (i) the personal connections the parties have to the countries which are relevant to the dispute (ii) the factual focus of the dispute (i.e. in what country/countries did the relevant events occur) (iii) factors affecting convenience or expense, such as the location of witnesses and / or documents (iv) applicable law and (v) whether the matter would receive a fair trial in another jurisdiction.",True,False,False,,0,1533114234,,False,0,e3ei2ga,False,t3_93n3r4,True,t1_e3ehs0q,/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/93n3r4/can_bvi_company_use_uk_courts_against_a_nonuk/e3ei2ga/,,1536955512,1,True,False,LegalAdviceUK,t5_32g6u,r/LegalAdviceUK,public,

As for your current issue, I think there are several potential causes you might want to consider. 

\- Make sure you are using the signature series. The difference between the traditional and signature is massive. Once they release the European cut for sax, I would recommend that as well. 

\- Légère reeds have a similar strength to Vandoren reeds, thus making them harder than a typical Rico reed. Check [here](https://www.legere.com/strength-charts) to find a Légère that matches your current cane reed. 

\- Légère reeds must be placed perfectly on the mouthpiece and secured firmly. Attempting to use a heavily worn Rovner or a cheap generic ligature may move the reed around, causing response issues. 

\- Try different mouthpieces with your Légère and see if the tone/responsiveness changes. I currently use a Légère 3 on my baritone sax along with a Selmer C\* and have had excellent results. I'm not suggesting that you go and buy a $250 mouthpiece, but if the previous two steps do not help, try experimenting with other mouthpieces. 

\- When playing on a Légère, especially on baritone sax, loosen your embouchure slightly more than usual. This often helps with the added firmness of synthetic reeds. 

\- Finally, make sure to touch your tongue to the very tip of the reed. I know many bari players that tongue too low on their reeds and are able to get away with it. Not only is this extremely limiting and an example of poor technique, but it makes playing on synthetic reeds nigh impossible. 

After a couple years of heavy playing, I use Légère signature reeds almost exclusively on classical soprano, alto, tenor, and bari.  It will take some trial and error to find the best reed and setup though, so stay diligent.

TEHRAN, Iran –  Iran's parliament announced Wednesday it would hold a special session to question President Hassan Rouhani about the plummeting currency and struggling economy.

In the announcement on the parliament's website, lawmakers said Rouhani must appear within a month in an open session to answer questions, but no specific date was announced.

The rial has slipped since the U.S. pulled out of the nuclear deal in May and said it would restore sanctions that had been lifted in exchange for Iran curbing its atomic activities. The first of those renewed sanctions go into effect Monday.

Iran is negotiating with other world powers that are parties to the deal — China, Russia, Germany, France, Britain as well as the European Union — in a bid to salvage it with new incentives.

Lawmakers plan to separately question Labor Minister Ali Rabiei over the 12.5 percent unemployment rate. He already appeared before parliament in March, when they voted to keep him in office.

Pressure is building on Rouhani as Iran's economic woes mount. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has ordered Rouhani, the speaker of parliament and the head of the judiciary to work together and find a way to resolve the problems.

On Tuesday, 200 of 290 members of parliament signed a letter to Rouhani urging him to make changes to his economic team.

Rouhani's administration has already replaced the central bank governor and taken other measures to shore up the currency, which hit a new low this week.

Meanwhile, some hard-liners have called for new elections or for Rouhani's civilian government to be replaced by a military-led one.

The Fars news agency, believed to be close to Iran's hard-line elite Revolutionary Guard, in July distributed an op-ed from the Sobh-e No daily newspaper describing the government as too ready to ""bow down to foreign threats.""

False,ReadTheArticleBitch,1531801744.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_1sj151xm,"**Aloha to you, too, ungrateful mainlanders**

The Hawaiian dictionary defines “aloha” as “love, affection, compassion, mercy, sympathy, pity, kindness, sentiment, grace, charity.” It is a synonym for “sweetheart” or “loved one,” “hello,” “farewell” and “beloved, loving, kind, compassionate, charitable, lovable.” It is also a verb meaning “to love” or “to show kindness, mercy, pity, charity, affection.”

The word means a lot to those of us with Hawaiian roots. So we were upset to hear that a fast-food chain in Chicago called Aloha Poke Co. has been sending letters ordering companies in Hawaii and elsewhere to stop using “aloha” in their names. Aloha Poke sells food in bowls meant to resemble poke, a Hawaiian dish made of raw fish and seaweed and other seasonings. Nobody in Hawaii told these guys they couldn’t do this to our beloved poke, even though they are making it wrong, or that they couldn’t make commercial use of our greatest word.

The word is free, of course, and is used by us in a spirit that is open and welcoming to those who want to share. The reaction in Hawaii to the cease-and-desist “aloha” letters has been anger and disbelief. But the trouble, the pilikia, is for real. A native-Hawaiian poke-shop owner in Alaska  told The Washington Post that after getting the letter she abandoned the name “Aloha Poke Stop” and spent thousands of dollars removing “aloha” from her company’s signs and T-shirts and other materials.

The company claims it was misunderstood and meant no harm. Its claim on the word “aloha’’ is irritating and absurd, but since Aloha Poke chose to go down that road, maybe we should all think about this a little. Maybe we should all re-examine the world’s relationship with Hawaii with an eye to reciprocity and ownership and fair compensation.

It’s not that the mainland hasn’t given us things. Christianity, for which many (not all) of us say a heartfelt thank you. Western diseases and a colonial mindset, of which we are less appreciative. Spam, which all of us outside our cardiology community love. But the perspective from the islands is that for centuries we have been giving, giving and giving, while the rest of you have been taking, taking and taking.

Taking what? you ask.

Surfing. You may not realize that your ancestors found ocean waves terrifying. Mark Twain, visiting in 1866, saw islanders surfing and freaked out. We give him credit for trying it, though. People the world over have surf, but only the Hawaiians perfected surfing. It’s ours; please return it and find some other way to have fun in the water.

The hula. This is a dance of beauty and grace and spiritual power, a foundation of Hawaiian culture. That thing you do at parties with the plastic leis, grass skirts and flapping arms — could you stop calling it hula, or just stop doing it altogether?

The ukulele. This instrument has a European ancestor, the braguinha, brought to the islands by the Portuguese. But we refined it and gave it a new name, meaning “jumping flea,” and we still make the best ones, out of native koa wood, and our Hawaii-born musicians work wonders with them. We are very sorry, mainland hipsters, this isn’t your fault. But we would like our ukes back.

The steel guitar.  Back when Joseph Kekuku, a country boy from Laie, on Oahu, was a child, he slid a steel bolt along the strings of his guitar, making a lovely sound.  He trained himself and others on the new way to play, which spread to the mainland and into honky-tonk history. Please remove the twang from your country and western music and return it to us.

Cowboys. Speaking of country and western, the idea of men on horseback driving cattle to market — our paniolos did that first, in the 1830s, a few decades before your cowpokes and cowpunchers. If you could please rejigger your movies and rewrite your frontier mythology and have your guys chase those dogies on foot or with A.T.V.’s or drones or what have you. Thanks.

Sugar and pineapple. You liked those, all those years, didn’t you? You’re welcome.

“Over the Rainbow,” the soulful version.  Go ahead and keep Judy Garland’s song, but we would like Iz Kamakawiwo’ole’s back. His voice is the pure heart of Hawaii that contains all the sorrow and joy and aloha in the world, which is why you can’t stop listening to it. Please stop.

Casual Friday and aloha shirts. These floppy floral shirts were invented in Honolulu, as was the practice of wearing them once a week to unstiffen the workplace. Our “aloha Friday” became your “casual Friday,” and “aloha shirts” became “Hawaiian shirts.” You didn’t ask. You have polo shirts and baseball caps; use those.

Your superpower status. Who repaired and refloated all but two American warships destroyed in Pearl Harbor in 1941, so that the United States Navy could defeat the Japanese empire? Workers in Honolulu did. Where did those Japanese-American soldiers brave enough to give their right arms to protect democracy and freedom in Europe come from? You know where. Today you get to sleep well in places like Chicago, knowing that the United States is projecting its military might into the Pacific, the ocean we are in the middle of. Meanwhile, we are the ones who get spooked by reports of North Korean missiles. How fair is that?

Racial harmony. When civil-rights marchers were being shot in Mississippi, and before the Supreme Court, in the Loving case, struck down bans on interracial marriage, the state of Hawaii was sending its governor to Botswana, a new democracy in southern Africa hemmed in by racist regimes. A Honolulu newspaperman hailed the moment: “The Hawaii-Botswana relationship is a long-range friendship, designed to help the earth resound from pole to pole with one famous cry, ‘Aloha!’” Why? The two places are antipodes — exactly opposite each other on the globe — but they had in common a culture of racial harmony and peace. Interracial marriage was truly unremarkable in Hawaii then, and Botswana’s new president, Seretse Khama, was married to a white English woman. That was 1966. What took the rest of you so long?

Barack Obama. Are you through with him? A lot of you seem to have moved on. Please send him back to Kailua.

The aloha spirit. It’s easy to be cynical if you spend any time in Waikiki. But the spirit of aloha is a real thing in Hawaii. It’s what makes honeymooners all honeymooney; they can sense it in the scented air the moment they get off the plane. It’s what keeps us going, despite our many problems of homelessness, income inequality, environmental ruin, rat-race traffic —  the kindness of family and friends, the welcome to strangers, the warm, motley, mixed-up way our immigrant forebears and our Hawaiian host culture have blended. It’s the way we are when we are relaxing with poke and beer and ukuleles at the beach.

It’s aloha, and it’s not for sale. I say this with love, affection, compassion, mercy, sympathy, pity, kindness, sentiment, grace and charity.

Pra entender porque as coisas são como são é sempre bom ver o histórico da coisa, e no caso da teologia isso é FUNDAMENTAL, só a história da teologia explica porque as correntes atuais são como são.

Então recomendo procurar livros de história da teologia. Justo Gonzales talvez seja a fonte mais usada no meio evangélico brasileiro (No meio neopentecostal não sei, não tenho certeza se estes sabem ler). Se for católico recomendo IGNORAR a Editora Vozes (Feita pra riponga amigos do Lula, tipo o Leonardo Boff) e ir pra editora Paulus, não tem um condensado, nem um autor mais proeminente, justo por ter mais vendas o assunto é pulverizado em vários livros (E não é tudo tão católico assim, um clássico da história a.C. é John Bright, que é um presbiteriano dos EUA, mas é publicado justo pela Paulus! É simples questão de qualidade, autores como John Bright, Bengt Hägglund e Justo Gonzales transcendem sua denominação.

Se pular a história de como tudo ficou como ficou, e partir direto pra leitura interpretativa de texto bíblico, você provavelmente irá cair nos MESMOS erros que centenas de igrejotas caíram ao serem fundadas no passado. Evite isso, você não vai revolucionar o mundo, especialmente porque estamos falando de conteúdo estático, os livros-base pra teologia não mudam a muuuuitos séculos então não tem como tirar uma interpretação nova disso.

Fora a parte histórica, recomendo títulos de **teologia sistemática**. A sistematização é simplesmente a organização da coisa, definir que se o texto bíblico diz que A=B e que A=C, então só se pode concluir que B=C apesar do texto não citar isso. Todas as grandes correntes do cristianismo tem seus títulos de teologia sistemática, se for católico, metodista, luterano, batista, terá livros de teologia sistemática pra servir de base. Se for pentecostal terá menos títulos. Se for neopentecostal duvido que tenha alguma coisa que preste, nessa área tem muita encheção de linguiça, só conteúdo pastoral ou auto-ajuda, nada de sistematização e lógica que eu tenha visto.

Posso ajudar com os grandes autores de cada área, mas preciso saber qual sua denominação ou linha de igreja, não existe sistemática não-denominacional (História tem, porque no passado não tinha um milhão de denominações), afinal o que diferencia as denominações é justo os diferentes métodos de sistematizações e as diferenças resultantes na sistematização a partir de pequenas alterações nas bases de crenças (No exemplo dado, digamos que um entender que A=B e outro entende que A simboliza B, pra não cair nesses erros interpretativos TEM QUE fazer muita exegese de texto (Esse podcast evangélico dessa semana é sobre [exegese bíblica](http://bibotalk.com/podcast/exegese-biblica-btcast-256/)), e TEM QUE recorrer ao texto original as vezes, ou seja, aprender grego e hebraico (Eu aprendi. E foram **muito** úteis FORA da teologia!), mas também é bom ver como isso foi historicamente traduzido ao longo dos séculos (Pra isso se aprende latim, inglês, alemão, ou outro idioma por onde sua denominação andou no passado. Latim não é útil só pra católicos (Afinal por 1500 anos não tinha igreja católica, tinha só ""igreja""), mesmo as traduções romanas explicam muito sobre umas praxes pentecostais atuais, simples questão de manutenção vestigial de tradição que ninguém mais nota). Enfim, pra não cair em AINDA mais erros de interpretação TEM QUE saber esmiuçar um texto (Antes de ir pra faculdade eu já fazia ""exegese"" porque em TI o peso da diferença de IF e ELSE é grande num programa, ou um datasheet de componente a diferença entre VA e Watt resulta em ainda mais diferenças. Noobs não enxergam esses detalhes e vivem fazendo cagada), e pra isso precisa saber as bases da exegese, e as bases da tradução, pra você escolher qual usa, afinal com séculos de história não tem nada novo, tudo já foi discutido e esmiuçado ao máximo, é só você escolher o que pra sua visão é a interpretação correta, mas tem que basear isso não com chutometro, e sim com base no texto original e em coerência (Se A=B e A=C, não não dá pra fazer ginástica interpretativa pra dizer que B é diferente de C).

Again, I think this is a case of selectively choosing the correct forecasts of ""your side"". There were numerous outright lies made by politicians in the Remain camp. 

The Remain camp certainly had analyses for economic consequences on its side, and Leave may have indeed lied more, but I don't think this equates to the campaign being basically honest. 

&gt;I don't understand this statement

Do you treat a general election vote as a wholesale endorsement of a given manifesto?

&gt; would not have expected these things to have materialised yet because we have not left, the nature of negotiation means that we will not be able to exercise unalloyed sovereignty because we will still international agreements which will necessarily require the surrender of some degree of sovereignty

Sure, but I don't think this prevents you from making qualitative judgements about sovereignty pre- vs. post-Brexit. Take international agreements which keep us in the WTO or ILO; they may require a sacrifice of some degree of sovereignty, but given that such bodies are multilateral global organisations which tend to draft regulations on a consensus-basis, rather than being a supranational government which operates with majoritarian voting, I think you can absolutely make a value-judgement about which is superior with respect to sovereignty. 

Same goes for bilaterally creating trade deals with other countries rather than being in a custom's union.

Same goes for being under an activist [foreign court](https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/speech-131120.pdf): 

&gt;Third, the Strasbourg court’s approach to judicial lawmaking gives rise, as it seems to me, to a
significant democratic deficit in some important areas of social policy. This is a particular
problem given the inherently political character of many of the issues which it decides. Most of
the human rights recognised by the Convention are qualified by express exceptions for cases
where the national law or action complained of was “necessary in a democratic society” (or some
equivalent phrase). The case-law of the Strasbourg court provides a good deal of guidance about
how these qualifications are to be applied. The court must ask itself a number of questions [. . .] 
These questions have only to be stated for it to be obvious that they are questions of policy.
Most people would regard them as inherently political questions. But their inclusion in the
Convention to a considerable extent removes them from the arena of legitimate political debate,
by transforming them into questions of law for judges.

You're assuming that socialism means ""no private property."" Go meet with members of (or go to the websites of) just about any standard European socialist party (SPDs, Labor Parties, etc.) and you'll notice that none of them really call for the elimination of private property. You'll then be at a cross roads: are you wrong about socialism or are socialists wrong about socialism. I trust you to recognize that earlier road will be more fruitful for you.

What socialists might (and often do) think can be helpful and important is a more democratic control over essential industries and strategic resources. In the 19th century this was shorthanded as ""the means of production."" Sometimes this would mean seizure of an existing industry, other times it would mean the creation of a government-industry upon the discovery of new resources and possibilities. A great instance of the latter would be upon discovering oil in the North Sea, the socialist-led Norwegian government recognized that the territory and the resource belonged to the Norwegian people, not to a privately-held company. So the government (democratically elected by the Norwegian people) decided to set up and lead its own oil business and put all the revenue into social programs. Seems reasonable to me, and it's turned Norway from one of Europe's poorest countries to one of the world's wealthiest. Generally, socialists think that this more democratic ownership of strategic and essential industries can benefit entire nations of people in countless ways - provided that scrupulous and accountable systems and people are set up to lead.

Also - Marxist aren't universally constitutive of socialism. Marx has a place at the table in talking about Socialism in the same way that Roman Catholics have a place at the table when talking about Christianity - important but not all encompassing.

The UK is a net contributor to the EU financially, is one of the most important and powerful nations on the planet in terms of defence and soft-power projection, has the strongest navy in the EU (as bad as it may be these days), is the gateway to North America, uses the world language of business and trade (English) which it also helps retain as the core EU language (without us, it'd likely turn to French, which most of the world does not come close to understanding).

The UK also is a net importer of goods, particularly from the EU, as a result of which there is substantial leverage in the form of trade. As much as people on here will try to argue that the EU cares less about our purchases because they are 27 countries and overall more people/GDP etc. the underlying fact is that the UK is an incredibly important economical piece of the EU, Europe as a whole (which we're not leaving of course) and losing our purchasing power would be a difficult pill to swallow. This isn't to say that the UK would not enjoy losing plenty of the EU sourced imports it currently enjoys, so I'm not trying to say it's a one way street in favour of the UK, but it certainly isn't solely in favour of the EU either.

As the financial capital of the world, in the ideal timezone, using the ideal language, with the best infrastructure and supporting infrastructure and most crucially, English Common Law, it is unlikely that the UK is going to lose this crown.

All manufacturing is relocating to cheaper locations within the world as part of globalisation, the UK suffers from this just like all major developed nations suffer. The only reason Germany is so strong on this is because of its dramatic advantage gained by getting to use the heavily deflated currency of the Euro, pinned down far lower than a sovereign Germany's currency would be otherwise, allowing for a dramatic export advantage.

Big business always does what's best for big business and you will see that manufacturing in developed nations will continue to decline, it will be buoyed by the likes of automation and technological advances, but that won't save the jobs. Those jobs are going to decline, whether it be to foreign nations or robots, they are going.

No denying that the UK was the sick man of Europe in the decades following WW2, which by the way, the UK effectively sacrificed its entire empire and dominant status in the world to win alongside their major allies such as the USA, France, Russia and the rest of the commonwealth and other allied nations. With such sacrifice comes great decline and a war that was so costly to so many across the world was naturally deeply damaging to the nation which was at the top. You could also argue that the roots of WW2 were sewn during WW1, which was largely a war about Imperial Germany being envious of the dominant position the UK and France enjoyed over the seas and the world and wanting to have its turn.

The early days of the EU helped the UK go from being over-regulated and bogged down in bureaucracy, to a more streamlined nation which was more open and deregulated, modern and forward thinking, much more in line with the other members of the EEC (as it was then known). In those days the EEC was definitely the place to be and you'll find few British citizens who will deny that it was a good decision to join such a trading area and cooperate given the position we were in.

However, in recent decades it has been the EU that has started to get bogged down, overly bureaucratic and legislative, bloated and slow to evolve, the power hungry nature of those at the top of the EU has seen it expand too much and too quickly and there are great problems and division among so many of the member states. The EU suddenly isn't the most perfect place to be and the UK is in a position where it can realistically consider that a different path may be a better way to go (although this is up for debate).

Finally, with regard to these organisations, regulatory bodies, standards, rules and regulations that you mentioned. It is only natural for a deeply entwined and committed relationship spanning many nations, many decades and vast levels of complexity, to be immensely difficult to unravel and separate from in a sensible and rapid manner. This would be the most complex divorce in history that could take decades of unraveling before the deep roots are separated properly and fairly. Just because this fact exists and that it may be exceedingly difficult to leave, it doesn't mean it might not still be the better choice, or a valid option. Perhaps having such regulations and such links between nations is actually a problem and this process is exposing that so much regulation and so many organisations is actually too much?

This is a deeply complex subject and situation we find ourselves in, one which really cannot be summed up by a binary argument of yes/no, love/hate, leave/remain or wrong/right.

I believe we're stronger together, but also that there are some deep rooted issues in both the UK and the EU that require change for us to continue down the best possible path. It requires a lot more effort, critical thinking and open discussion than any politicians on either side has currently given it and I have very little faith they will ever do the situation justice.",True,False,False,,0,1533127856,,False,0,e3eqdyf,False,t3_93nl72,True,t1_e3epape,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/93nl72/people_want_a_proper_say_on_brexit_let_them_have/e3eqdyf/,,1536959409,-1,True,False,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,r/unitedkingdom,public,

False,ReadTheArticleBitch,1531801744.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_1sj151xm,"**Did Real Madrid Coach Julen Lopetegui Really Claim That Gareth Bale Was Going To Replace Ronaldo?**

As soon as the initial shock wore off, attention turned to who Real Madrid would sign to replace Juventus-bound Cristiano Ronaldo.


Robert Lewandowski, Harry Kane, Eden Hazard, Paulo Dybala, Mo Salah, Kylian Mbappé and the ever popular Neymar were all common picks.


Now, four weeks after the story of Ronaldo’s departure broke, there has been no move to splash-the-cash by Real Madrid.  Although the transfer window for Spanish clubs does not close until August 31, there is a growing feeling that the European Champions may opt to go with what they have.


At the press conference before their International Champions Cup game against Manchester United (Manchester United won 2-1), comments expressed by the new Real Madrid Coach reinforced the notion that the checkbook was under lock and key.


Not surprisingly, Lopetegui also fielded questions about the role that Gareth Bale might play for Real Madrid in the new season.  Manchester United has appeared increasingly keen to bring Bale back to the Premier League after he moved to Real Madrid from Tottenham Hotspur in the summer of 2012.


What Lopetegui said about Bale was then creatively edited and it turned into a story of how Bale was to be Ronaldo’s replacement.


Here’s Julen Lopetegui's quote from the press conference:


It is quite clear that Lopetegui views the filling of the void as a squad job and not a responsibility to be thrust on just one player.


Sticking with the existing squad is certainly good news for younger players such as Lucas Vázquez, new arrival Vinícius Júnior and the supremely talented Marco Asensio.


But does anyway really expect that any of these younger players are going to start filling the net on a consistent basis?  Furthermore, looking at the more experienced players it would be quite an achievement if Bale and Karim Benzema in tandem could get even close to the scoring heights hit by Ronaldo on a regular basis.


Since Bale moved to Real Madrid, his goals plus Benzema’s goals have never beaten or matched Ronaldo’s output.


A deeper dive into the statistics shows the scoring hole that the Ronaldo-less Real Madrid has to fill.


Over Ronaldo’s nine seasons at the Estadio Santiago Bernabéu, the Portuguese striker scored just under 33% of Real Madrid’s goals – 450 goals out of a total of 1,376. Ronaldo’s average goals per season were 50 and the team’s total goal output averaged just over 152.


In the three seasons, before he arrived, Real Madrid’s highest tally was 104 and the average was 98. It may be overly simplistic but deduct Ronaldo’s average goals per season from the team average and you get 102 – not far off the average tally of 98 that Real Madrid produced pre-#CR7.


So while Ronaldo was contributing one out of every three goals at an average of 1.03 goals per game for Real Madrid, what was the supporting cast delivering?


Gareth Bale’s best season for Real Madrid was 22 goals in 2013/14. His best goals per game performance came in an injury-scarred 2015/16 season when he scored 19 goals in 31 games – 0.6 goals per game.


It is worth noting that not only did Ronaldo score a lot of goals but he also played a lot of games and showed remarkable resiliency – an average of nearly 48 games per season. He only played less than 44 games in a season once and that was in his first season when he played 35.


Gareth Bale has never made more than 48 appearances in a Real Madrid strip and his average is 38 games a season – 26% less than Ronaldo.


Yes, but didn’t Karim Benzema once score 32 goals in a season for Real Madrid and isn't it possible that he might recover that sort of form?


Benzema did indeed score 32 goals for Real Madrid but it was six seasons ago. He did knock in 28 goals in 15/16 but that was followed by 31 goals in 95 games in his last two seasons.


Benzema comes close to matching Ronaldo’s appearances with 413 games over the same 9 seasons – they both arrived in the summer of 2009. However, his total goals (192) and his average of 0.48 goals per game are not in the same league.


As for the others, Gonzalo Higuaín scored 86 goals in four seasons from 2009 to 2013 before he was sold to Napoli. Alvaro Morata looked to be on verge of becoming a consistent scoring threat with 20 goals in 43 appearances (a good number as a substitute) but he was sold in the summer of 2017 to Chelsea.


If Real Madrid miraculously fills the scoring gap left by Cristiano Ronaldo it will be a phenomenal achievement. But as it stands I’m thinking that Real Madrid fans are going to have a lot fewer goals to cheer this season unless President Florentino Perez issues fresh orders to go forth and find the team another goal scorer.

First off: Frisch didn't set play in real world Andorra, despite the name. Andorra could be any European country/city/town, but in my and many others opinion it's probably heavily inspired by Switzerland and its role in WWII. 

Short introduction to the Plot (fictional), I tried not to spoil anything here: This story revolves around Andri, a boy in a fictional town called Andorra. He's one of few Jews there. The book describes his experiences with the townsfolk and their behavior, which on one hand differs between individuals but on the other hand has many similarities. Andorra at the same time is at the threat of a neighboring antisemitic nation, their members simply called 'blacks' (Frisch drawing on the fascist Italian [Blackshirts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackshirts)), thus kind of a save-haven for Jewish people like Andri, but at the same time he still experiences discrimination there. 

Had to read it in school many years ago, I think almost everyone in the german-speaking part of Switzerland does. Furthermore it's also well known in Germany, I'm not sure about other countries.  
In my opinion, the book is not just well written, but it also invites to reflect upon different things: history, *what if...* type of questions, parallels between things in the book and real world happenings, antisemitism, ostracism, society, ones own behavior as a part of society and more.",True,False,False,,0,1533130462,,False,0,e3esu0b,False,t3_93o16s,True,t3_93o16s,/r/books/comments/93o16s/literature_of_switzerland_august_2018/e3esu0b/,,1536960525,8,True,False,books,t5_2qh4i,r/books,public,

that's got nothing to do with a ""profit motive"" - a profit motive is natural in human beings - it absolutely is - it's just a matter of whether that profit motive is abused by doing very illegal things with politicians - or if it's not illegal, very politically unsightly and unpopular if word gets out 

&gt;Politicians therefore are a service that can help private actors in gaining profit

or they can do this *and* make unions much more powerful which can absolutely destroy certain industries for the sake and power of the bosses on the top...that's why the UK in the 1970s was called the sick man of europe - because their industrial trade unions had a huge grip over the government and it took a very right wing government to finally stop this being the status quo

&gt;This service can be bought in many forms: bribes, lobbying, donations, vote buying, manipulation of media to convince voters, and others that might've slipped my mind.

this can still be done under a socialist government - that's how all social governments in the past operated. 

&gt;I'm not saying that every capitalist state is engaged in crony capitalism, but I do think that crony capitalism is favoured in the same way that low entropy is favoured in closed systems.

I'll level with you - I think crony capitalism sadly exists in most capitalist regimes. in some more than others, of course, and it depends on how you define it; ""democratic corporatism"" in the nordic countries is where big business and trade unions, alongside the government, draft the laws that affect the economy - that's kind of crony capitalism as a matter of institution, but some prefer this than classical pluralism. however, it is a very difficult thing to uproot because money goes to the heart of party politics. but that's going to be the case in socialist democracy too because human beings are always after money. and there will be incentives in socialist governments to have some money concentrated in some hands too. again: all socialist regimes have been this way. they just had the bad faith to not do what they said they'd do. the thing question isn't a matter of ""is socialism better at getting rid of capitalism"" in my opinion, therefore. it's ""what can we do to best stop crony capitalism""? and in my opinion it's about making politics more local, making politicians more accountable (i.e. right to recall politicians who're involved in expenses scandals; we need this in the UK that's for damn fucking sure.), making electoral laws much more transparent (some countries already do this well) such as limits on donations and the publicity of those donations, etc",True,False,False,,1,1533132694,,1533132990,0,e3ev5lk,False,t3_93p0d5,True,t3_93p0d5,/r/changemyview/comments/93p0d5/cmv_i_think_capitalism_favours_crony_capitalism/e3ev5lk/,,1536961615,3,True,False,changemyview,t5_2w2s8,r/changemyview,public,

From the pen of Thomas Jefferson, Paris, 1/16/1787. 

&gt;The tumults in America, I expected would have produced in Europe an unfavorable opinion of our political state. But it has not. On the contrary, the small effect of those tumults seems to have given more confidence in the firmness of our governments. The interposition of the people themselves on the side of government has had a great effect on the opinion here. I am persuaded myself that the good sense of the people will always be found to be the best army. They may be led astray for a moment, but will soon correct themselves. **The people are the only censors of their governors: and even their errors will tend to keep these to the true principles of their institution**. To punish these errors too severely would be to suppress the only safeguard of the public liberty. **The way to prevent these irregular interpositions of the people is to give them full information of their affairs thro’ the channel of the public papers, and to contrive that those papers should penetrate the whole mass of the people**. The basis of our governments being the opinion of the people, the very first object should be to keep that right; and were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter. But I should mean that every man should receive those papers and be capable of reading them. I am convinced that those societies (as the Indians) which live without government enjoy in their general mass an infinitely greater degree of happiness than those who live under European governments. Among the former, public opinion is in the place of law, and restrains morals as powerfully as laws ever did any where. **Among the latter, under pretence of governing they have divided their nations into two classes, wolves and sheep**. I do not exaggerate. This is a true picture of Europe. Cherish therefore the spirit of our people, and keep alive their attention. Do not be too severe upon their errors, but **reclaim them by enlightening them**. If once they become **inattentive to the public affairs, you and I, and Congress, and Assemblies, judges and governors shall all become wolves**. It seems to be the law of our general nature, in spite of individual exceptions; and experience **declares that man is the only animal which devours his own kind, for I can apply no milder term to the governments of Europe, and to the general prey of the rich on the poor**.

Amsterdam is very international, but also very much a tourist city, as has been mentioned. It's a big city like many other so if you're looking to have a good impression of the country itself you won't find it just there. I recommend Maastricht, Nijmegen, Eindhoven and other smaller cities any time. Especially for engineering, Delft and Eindhoven are the places to be since you have the technical universities there. Maybe see if you can do a transfer there. If not, no big deal. What I do think is good is that most dutch people have a good understanding of english (&gt;90%), so you won't have much trouble with communication for your job.

As for your issues with US: from what I've seen I understand your worries, but keep it mind moving elsewhere won't magically make things go away. I think every place has problems of racist, greedy, self centered or just trashy people. It's not specifically a US issue. It's a human one.

The extend of it may differ perhaps. I can't really comment on personal experience so much as I've never lived in the US. Do keep in mind that NL is much more population dense so you won't find huge rural areas in the US where I can imagine some people don't have the best infrastructure or education. There is a 'bible belt', but afaik they don't bother people too much.

And I'm not going to mince words: there's plenty of arguments for migrant control ever since the 70s and this can particularly be taken to the extreme with some trashy people and form xenophobic sentiment. You won't find people in europe showing the same kind of discriminatory remarks as the US or show the same level of obsession with race, but it is there. So keep that in mind. 

Strangely enough, dutch people, despite being raised typically to be humble in their nationalism, do tend to have a kind of pride on the web. In my opinion, the many tales of NL being a super tolerant and highly liberal place are completely excaggerated. 

Feel free to ask anything specific. I'm just trying to not set you up to be dissapointed.

Not always true - it depends on the region and the period that you are looking at. In the case of Europe ex-UK, 57% of active managers (per Morningstar) have beaten the benchmark (after fees) so far this year, and it's been 50% over the last 10 years (after fees). So out of all of the active funds, quite a lot of them have beaten the index over that period.

edit: I forgot to subtract the fees for the Vanguard tracker for the benchmark. Assuming it tracked it perfectly and cost 12bps per year, 86% of active managers outperformed the Vanguard product over the last 10 years.


It's not my place to say whether active or passive is better for any individual. My point is that you cannot say automatically one is better than the other.


Woodford is actually a great example for why you need to do your research properly if looking for an active manager. Lots of people were wowed by his track record but anyone looking at the holdings should have run a mile - it shouldn't be an open-ended vehicle.

Cartilage is a resilient and smooth  elastic tissue, a rubber-like padding that covers and protects the ends of long bones at the joints, and is a structural component of the rib cage, the ear, the nose, the bronchial tubes, the intervertebral discs, and many other body components. It is not as hard and rigid as bone, but it is much stiffer and much less flexible than muscle.The matrix of cartilage is made up of chondrin.

Because of its rigidity, cartilage often serves the purpose of holding tubes open in the body. Examples include the rings of the trachea, such as the cricoid cartilage and carina.

**Stegosauria**

Stegosauria is a group of herbivorous ornithischian dinosaurs that lived during the Jurassic and early Cretaceous periods. Stegosaurian fossils have been found mostly in the Northern Hemisphere, predominantly in what is now North America, Europe and China, though one species (Kentrosaurus aethiopicus) is known to have lived in Africa. Their geographical origins are unclear; the earliest unequivocal stegosaurian, Huayangosaurus taibaii, lived in China.

Stegosaurians were armored dinosaurs (thyreophorans).

***

**Dinosaur**

Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles of the clade Dinosauria. They first appeared during the Triassic period, between 243 and 233.23 million years ago, although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event 201 million years ago; their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. Reverse genetic engineering and the fossil record both demonstrate that birds are modern feathered dinosaurs, having evolved from earlier theropods during the late Jurassic Period.

No, it's not opinion. It's what the statistics tell us. You're conflating objective and subjective interpretations/measurements.

&gt; If you are going to try and convince me of your opinion and I am completely open to being convinced

Again, it's not an opinion. All one has to do is look at numbers. I've been providing articles to source these things (you could even read the one posted by OP!) and yet you seemingly haven't tried to understand this. You keep relying on fantasy stats and 'eye test' and other old-school nonsense that doesn't hold up to empirical scrutiny. You claim you're here with an open-mind, but it doesn't seem it. We were lucky based off our performances. Liverpool/Spurs were better than us and outperformed us. They were/are better teams than us. 

&gt; I expect you to give me a logical estimate of how many points you think each of us should have finished with.

[Here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/soccer-predictions/premier-league/) is SPI which has us as the 6th best team in England (and 18th in Europe). [Here](https://understat.com/league/EPL) is based on xP (expected points) has us at 6th with 62 pts, which is too low and possibly too simplistic of a measurement which then discounts DDG.  However, what all this indicates is that we were lucky to finish where we did and we relied way too much on our GK; who had the highest save % in a [decade](https://objective-football.blogspot.com/2014/12/the-enlightened-era-2009-2014.html). 

&gt; This is your opinion and not exactly borne out by reality.

Uh, no this is fact based (I even sourced it but since you don't read what I post). Sorry to burst your bubble but you seem to constantly conflate opinion with facts. Goalkeeping is more volatile than striking. 

&gt; Only someone who lacks an argument will need to get personal to cover up for it.

Sorry, but it's frustrating to have my fact based arguments discounted and to hear your repeated ""RINGS ERNEH"" argument.

&gt; Yes, I do think we were better than them in 2017-18.

We definitely finished higher than them! However, we weren't better by an measurable statistic and if you replayed last season 1000x they would most certainly finish above us WAY more often than we finish above them based off performance. They were a better team unfortunately.  

&gt; I expect Liverpool to finish ahead of us this year, but that has no bearing on what happened last year.

They likely will, and we can in part forecast that because of how much better they performed than us last season.

Mini rant time - I get it people, some of the streets around uptown are small and dual sided parking makes things tight. However, driving through them countless times has made me realize, over 3/4 of people on the road have absolutely ZERO sense of how big their vehicle is and how to properly maneuver in tight spaces. 

Now I don't want to come off as some sort of Euro-snob, but the fact is Europeans are miles better than most all of us in the states at judging the size of their car and getting through tight squeezes as lets face it, their streets are nearly all tiny. I drove for a few weeks in Ireland and some of those one lane roads? Holy hell were they *TINY*. The thing was though, you come up to someone and it would end with you passing by tightly, but successfully.

Getting back to here, people who have more than enough room to make two cars abreast work here in uptown wander into the middle of the road because ""oh it's too tight I can't fit I might hit you"". I've gotten death glares for sticking tight to the parked cars on the right (always at a slow and steady rate of speed to be careful), when someone expects you to move over to let them through. No! You can make it, just have a better sense of your car and we both can get through just fine! It's just so annoying when you come up to someone who refuses to move over to allow two cars when they think their car is too big to fit. 

Again this is going to come off as ranty, but still I think more people need to have a better sense of the car around them - will lead to better drivers all around, better parkers, and less accidents. And not that I'm saying ""hurr durr Europeans are great we should be European"", I'm just pointing out that they're understandably much better at the small road thing than we are.

False,[deleted],,,,,,,dark,,,"Right, but by that logic they would say that you hate leaving your children with a functioning government that isn't bankrupt.

It isn't that you don't WANT a balanced budget, social programs are more important to you. I suspect in a world where budgets were balanced, there was a constant surplus and we didn't know what to do with money, they'd be perfectly happy to have a wealth of social programs. For a lot of them, they don't want to leave their children with a bankrupt future and no social programs at all.

Look at places like Greece, facing staggering austerity. A lot of that was caused by rampant spending and an unwillingness to reign in the deficits. That's what happens when spending goes unchecked forever. That's what most conservatives are trying to avoid.

You're being overly simplistic and combative. Consider a room of 20 people. 5 are die hard Liberal-voters, 5 are staunch Conservative-voters. You've got 10 votes to swing. Telling people if they vote Conservative they are heartless and want people to die won't win them over. Look at US or European politics as an example. People are digging trenches BECAUSE of this exact method of labeling and denigrating. If you want to win those 10 over, tell them WHY your policies are better, be prepared to conceded on some points and don't be afraid to reach a compromise. Reasonable people are swayed by reasonable arguments, not combative and immature namecalling.

We need civilized discourse, and that means treating people as human beings with empathy and feelings. Just because they don't prioritize the way you do doesn't mean they are heartless. And just because someone votes Conservative doesn't mean they are encouraging the suffering of people.

In a province with growing debt and a shrinking manufacturing base (which has long been it's largest industry), how do you propose avoiding austerity? Yes, we're fine now, our debt isn't at the point we're unable to function as a government... but we also aren't putting any aside for if those times come. Look at Alberta. They had a BOOMING economy. They were bringing in more money from oil than entire countries earn. They set up a fund to act as a safety net but then kept spending. 20 years later, Norway, earning a fraction from oil, started a fund too. Alberta's is almost empty while Norway has a pension for every man, woman and child. It's over $1 Trillion right now! Alberta could've had that! But they didn't, because they refused to ever tighten the belt. They should've kept a provincial tax and just saved their revenue.

Norway has a really good social policy, but it's also been fairly conservative in a lot of ways. In fact, if you follow their politics, they've been very conservative in the recent past. They've reigned in spending and either cut or didn't increase funding to programs if it meant accessing that fund early. You would have labels their voters as having no empathy, being heartless, enjoying people suffer... but now thanks to the conservative reigning in of spending, they literally never have to worry about it again. The interest on that one fund alone would provide UBI, ODSP, free tuition and pensions for everyone.

My point is you attract more bees with honey than with vinegar, and you'll be happier to boot if you see your fellow Ontarians and your fellow Canadians as peers, not heartless drones. They have a different outlook on how money should be spent RIGHT NOW, not a desire to see people suffer. The sooner you change to that paradigm, the sooner you'll find yourself able to accept their views while still disagreeing with them and finding compromises.

Do you know why the wartime economies of WWII were so strong and able to function? Because we all compromised for the greater good. And as a direct result, the western world saw the greatest growth economically and socially that it ever had in the aftermath. The war ended and for decades we still compromised, we still worked together, and we built stronger countries.

And now look... the West can't help but accuse each other of being traitors to humanity and all of our countries are in universal decline. Our economies are suffering, our politics are fractured....

Buddy Bolden was put down for not knowing enough music theory. The Creoles similarly put down Black musicians like King Oliver. I just don't think ""sophisticated"" is an accurate term for music that was played in bars and the streets, taught largely by oral tradition, oftentimes by men who could not read music.

You mention Jelly Roll Morton, and I want to point out that Morton was a Creole, so he was of a higher racial caste than say Buddy Bolden and King Oliver. Morton likely received more European training. Even so, here are some facts about Morton from wikipedia:

&gt; At the age of fourteen, Morton began working as a piano player in a brothel (or, as it was referred to then, a sporting house). In that atmosphere, he often sang smutty lyrics; he took the nickname ""Jelly Roll"", which was African-American slang for female genitalia, and by extension a lover of same.

just because it isn't new doesn't mean we need more of toxic kits. I wouldn't consider zed to be unfun to play against. there are still ways to deal with him (for example knowing exactly where he will land after pressing R) and seeing his shadows. also he fell of hard late. I agree tho that old nida was a bitch to play against because of her spear, her hitbox and her ability to escape. so now we have zoe. they made so she can fuck you up from even further behind, she has a slow, a long ass stun + damage amplifier, a dodge/gap closer and free random summoners and item actives popping up in lane at lvl 2... oh and unlike for nida, they made her Q an AOE. gragas actually needed to be fed to pop you. zoe can be behind and still do it. but so can others. ornn is another example of a champ being no fun to play against even when he's not complex for one bit. again, I'm not talking about winrates or possible counter picks. pyke is another overloaded champ. dude has so many escapes (and one escape even with some hard cc) that he doesn't even needs to go flash when played top. some champs are just bullshit to play against. 

example: ahri vs corki. ahri has uhm... I don't know... ludens. corki has trinity. both are at the same level and equally farmed. ahri misses Q and E (her bread and butter spells one might think) and corki lands his skills. ahri will fucking rape corki just by pressing R+W and it won't be close. that is the definition of unfun. people should get rewarded for dodging or hitting their shit. but both champs are as old as the problem itself.

I think one of the other big problems is, that everything deals damage. every keystone, every new item... they all just randomly give you extra damage or extra cc or an extra dash (while giving you damage). getting caught back then? there was a slight chance of getting out. getting caught now? you just pop. everything just suddenly has a huge burst.
ever played top as a melee vs no items poppy with aery? yea she just melts you without landing her spells. and she isn't complex either. it's just this random extra damage from all kinds of sources. there is so much shit applying damage that you don't even bother checking the death info because the stuff doesn't fit on it.",True,False,False,,0,1533141707,,False,0,e3f66d8,False,t3_93g9fd,True,t1_e3euy2g,/r/leagueoflegends/comments/93g9fd/experimental_modes_nexus_blitz/e3f66d8/,,1536966768,1,True,False,leagueoflegends,t5_2rfxx,r/leagueoflegends,public,

Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as communistic by its opponents in power? Where is the opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach of communism, against the more advanced opposition parties, as well as against its reactionary adversaries?
Two things result from this fact:
I. Communism is already acknowledged by all European powers to be itself a power.
II. It is high time that Communists should openly, in the face of the whole world, publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the Spectre of Communism with a manifesto of the party itself.
To this end, Communists of various nationalities have assembled in London and sketched the following manifesto, to be published in the English, French, German, Italian, Flemish and Danish languages.
Chapter I. Bourgeois and Proletarians(1)

[German Original]
The history of all hitherto existing society(2) is the history of class struggles.
Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master(3) and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.
In the earlier epochs of history, we find almost everywhere a complicated arrangement of society into various orders, a manifold gradation of social rank. In ancient Rome we have patricians, knights, plebeians, slaves; in the Middle Ages, feudal lords, vassals, guild-masters, journeymen, apprentices, serfs; in almost all of these classes, again, subordinate gradations.
The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones.
Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinct feature: it has simplified class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other — Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.

Totally. I've lived around the world, and I have yet to find a culture where working on yourself is valued outside of one very special culture I'll get to in a minute.

But the US values work first, people second. In the parts of the Middle East where I grew up, it was family/community first, work second. Seems to be the same in many other countries I've visited. Nowhere is ""yourself"" the first priority or a worthy priority.

That is, except with people who travel. This is the one exception I've seen to everywhere I've lived. People who prioritize traveling over work, over stability, over money. What can we call them? Journeypeople. People who go places and experience things as their primary mode of being. People on journeys.

They seek out people who are different from them, and then they seek out the parts of those different people that are similar to them. They make connections with others, they open up vulnerably about their histories, they validate each other.

Everyone who travels understands that in order to travel a lot, you sacrifice other things, that your parents/family/friends might find you strange, that you are breaking with the dominant paradigm of your culture, whatever culture that is.

because China stopping foreign investment is their problem, not ours. If China wants to pump their capital into Germany or Europe that's great news for us, it means that we're an attractive location to invest. 

That China closes off its own domestic market only hurts China. The Chinese government picking who gets to win and lose on their market just keeps uncompetitive business alive and robs Chinese people of opportunities.

I've lived in Europe for several years now (returning to C later this year), So I only get CNN international, Stream CBC, and watch UK, Dutch &amp; German news. As I see it North American news (even the ""good ones"") become more and more entrenched in their own narratives, its less on CBC but visible. (My realization of this was when Russia shot down MH17 and CNN provided a false translation that supported their narrative but when on Dutch TV it clearly stated something different.) And often I spot bias and falseness in the media on all sides. 


The problem isn't that people are listing to one source, its that sources are consolidating their narrative, reporting without researching and different echo chambers emerge which people stick within (so not one account, but a group that all say the same). So I dont think people take a singular source (but definitely they get stuck in echo chambers where multiple sources tell them the same thing) &amp; I don't think this is the case for this scenario. The twitterpage has a target on it, if it reports anything blatantly false (rather then the current Ford shook the PM's hand, then the policie chiefs hand, this is what i want to do...) then news/radio/tv outlets are going to call him out and people are going to know.

You see my point here, right? That's not all just puritanism. Yes, some countries are OK with exposed breasts. And I have no problem with that! France, Spain, the Scandinavian countries (if you're brave enough to go topless in the near-arctic), a number of African countries, some South American countries, a few places in Meso-America, some Southeast Asian countries... they exist. The culture there is a lot more open about that. Admittedly a number of those places are not great argument in this context, as the debate was about ""are breasts sexy"" which is still true in most of those places, but yes, even in some countries where breasts are seen as sexual, you can see them on TV, on beaches, in movies, etc. You won't see people walking around topless usually, but it is technically legal to do so.

If you live in America, though, that does not apply. The culture here is to remain covered. You may like that or not, but that's the way it is, and arguing ""well but other people do it differently in other places"" is arguing in bad faith. Obviously other people all over the world do things differently from us. That doesn't make us more right or them more right. All it means is that we're different and diverse.

Whether you think it is or not, this argument is about culture, it is about about taboo, and cultural relativism does apply.

As a side note:

I'm confused by how you can think a culture can be ""wrong"" on something like fashion or taste. That argument is always one I've heard from more right-wing people, and it's one I've always disagreed with. You, however, seem to be pretty left-wing yet still are coming from the same view: that somehow one culture's ideas can be superior to another's on issues as subjective as food, clothing, manners, or fashion.

I don't get it. Maybe you don't put toplessness in the same category, but it seems to me to be pretty cut and dry: that falls under the umbrella of social mores regarding appropriate fashion, and judging cultures' fashion to be ""right"" or ""wrong"" has strong imperialist, right-wing undertones.",True,False,False,,0,1533145923,,1533148075,0,e3fbkut,False,t3_93ebmv,True,t1_e3ew7cz,/r/SubredditDrama/comments/93ebmv/user_posts_a_photo_of_googlyeyes_pasted_above_a/e3fbkut/,,1536969283,1,True,False,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,r/SubredditDrama,public,

It is the people that voted for all these buffoons over the last 30 years (probably even more). It was completely obvious that SYRIZA wouldn't and couldn't keep their stupid preelection promises, and if people are that stupid to believe every lie that comes from the opposition (and every opposition that I have experienced), then they should refrain from voting.

Democracy works only when the voters think, self-reflect and self-criticize their choice before voting again, but this is not the case with the average Greek voter. Instead they just blindly vote for the one that promises more money. In the end people get the politicians that they deserve, politicians that will spew whatever lie gets them elected. It is the responsibility of the citizens to filter the liars, otherwise as we say in Greece only the crap and the corks stay afloat.

While SYRIZA did destroy the economic prospect of Greece by at least 5-10 years, due to the ridiculous macho negotiations with the EU, at least it seems to me that top level corruption is lower compared to previous governments. Do you really think that New Democracy would govern better, especially since they are at least half to blame for this mess that they created all these past years together with PASOK?

False,TheBassCave,1302368843.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_52wo2,"&gt;How do you think this season will go?

I think that any suggestion that we'll bother the European places is extremely premature and a bottom half finish is more likely. 

I have some sympathy with Manuel Pellegrini  -  the squad was in a terrible state when he arrived and he had little option other than to rip it up and start again - but changing so much in one go rarely works out well in the short term. Combine that with a radical shift in playing style for our existing players, the inevitable adjustment period of a new manager, and a relatively short pre-season and you've got a recipe for a very disjointed start.

The other concern is that, for all the money that spent in this window, we've not really addressed our major issues from the last two years. We had the worst defensive record in the league last season and that stemmed largely from both the lack of structure and the lack of a mobile destructive player in midfield which left our backline exposed on a regular basis. Rather than rectifying that, the club have instead signed three quarters of a new back four and a new goalkeeper, which feels like a case of treating the symptoms of a problem rather than the cause.

The spine of the team is still devoid of pace and quite limited in possession, so it's hard to see how we're going to play the type of possession-based football that Pellegrini wants -  it's nice to have players who are effective in the final third but they're not going to have much impact if we struggle to get the ball to them regularly. We're in a situation yet again where Mark Noble pretty much has to start as he's the only one of our current CM options who can reliably link midfield and defence. For all of his merits, if West Ham truly want to kick on to the next level, we can't be in a position where Nobes is an undisputed starter.

There are a handful of midtable clubs who have either recruited for their needs better than we have or are simply further along in their building process compared to us with an established manager and settled style of play. I think we'll need to be patient while Pellegrini instils his ideas on this team and essentially treat it as a transition year. As long as the football isn't utterly fucking miserable to watch and there are signs the groundwork is being laid for future success, I don't really care where we end up in the league table.

&gt;Which player is going to be star of the season and why?

Arthur Masuaku. There were glimpses of it last season, but his dribbling brings another dimension to this team and, if everything clicks, he could be a real difference maker on the overlap in a side that's otherwise a little short on width. The early signs of his link up with Anderson down the left have been encouraging and if he can help pin opposition wingers back with his forward runs, that'll help compensate for his defensive deficiencies.

&gt;How do you think the team will lineup

Based on the friendlies so far, it'll be a 4-3-3. The 3 in midfield will be quite fluid, with one player screening and one of the more advanced CMs pushing on to support the striker when we have the ball. The most likely starting XI atm seems to be:

Fabianski

Fredericks/ Balbuena/Ogbonna/Masuaku

Noble/Rice/Wilshere

Yarmolenko/Arnautović/Anderson

Balbuena appears to be favoured ahead of Diop for the time being and if Obiang sticks around he'll presumably play in games where we need to be robust/when Wilshere is unavailable. Javier Hernández is the wildcard - he's supposedly been promised a more significant role but he's been on holiday since the World Cup so no-one knows exactly how he fits in.

When Lanzini is back he'll slot into the midfield 3 and make this team an entirely different proposition. We'll miss him badly while he's out.

We give all our port traffic to the Netherlands. They give all their investment banking to the City of London. Fair, right? 

Except that the economist Paul Krugman was predicting as early as 1993 that this was going to cause serious political problems. He [wrote] (http://www.nber.org/papers/w4559):

&gt; The political difficulties posed by this adjustment problem are obvious. European nations may be enthusiastic about the benefits of economic integration in the abstract. But when it turns out that such integration involves losses as well as gains, and in particular that the **geographic consolidation of industries means that some national industries vanish**, the charges of ""social dumping"" are sure to fly. 

This explains why the North voted so heavily for Brexit. Their industries were given away so London could be the EU's equivalent of New York. 

Our decision to narrow our economy to financial services also means that when a financial crash occurs, as it did in 2008, we're especially screwed.

Maybe some don't know what CQ VT or CQ DX or CQ EU mean.

Along those thoughts, I went back and re-read the IARU's ""etiquette guide"" by ON4UN &amp; ON4WW, and found this (noting particularly the last bullet):

&gt;**II.8.2. What does ‘CQ DX’ mean?**.  
&gt;• If you want to contact long distance stations, call ‘*CQ DX*’.  
&gt;• What is **DX**?

&gt;• On VHF-UHF: stations located at more than approx. 300 km.  
&gt;• During a CQ you can insist that you only want to work DX stations, as follows: ‘*CQ DX, outside Europe, this is...*’.  
&gt;• Always be obliging; maybe the local station calling you after your CQ DX is a newcomer, and maybe you are a new country for him. Why not just give him a quick QSO?

It’s steady as she goes for the Fed this time around, as many investors had pretty much baked in. After a June hike of the benchmark  federal-funds rate to a range between 1.75% and 2%, the Fed concluded this week’s meeting Wednesday by standing pat and keeping rates right there.


The economy continues to look healthy by most measures, the Fed’s statement said, but rate policy remains “accommodative” to support what the Fed called “ strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2% inflation.” Still, the Fed arguably seems to be preparing investors for a possible rate hike by the time of its next meeting in September.


The Fed sees risks to the economy as “roughly balanced,” and said  that “further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term.”


The statement was relatively short, leaving the impression that the Fed doesn’t have much new to say, at least not this time around. Just two weeks ago Fed Chairman Jerome Powell testified to Congress and laid out a similar set of remarks. The vote to keep rates unchanged was unanimous.


There really wasn’t much new insight from the Fed on Wednesday, at least not much that we haven’t heard before. The market continues to look for direction, but didn’t get too much from Powell and company.


The S&amp;P 500 Index was down going into the Fed’s announcement and sank further after the news. Still, it remained above the 2800 level where technical analysts see psychological support. Meanwhile, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, which hit 3% earlier in the day, traded at 2.99% in the minutes after the Fed statement. The two-year yield gained slightly on the 10-year, narrowing the spread between them.


The question heading into the meeting was less whether the Fed would hike (the futures market pegged odds at below 2%) and more about where rates might ultimately be headed. The Fed continues to indicate that it plans to raise rates in a way that keeps pace with a strengthening economy but not to levels where they might weaken growth. Where that “neutral” level might be remains a subject of debate.


The Fed’s challenge is to raise rates and inflation back toward historical norms without steering the economy into a recession due to higher borrowing costs. Remember, the Fed has a “dual mandate” of full employment and monetary stability, and right now, unemployment has been quite low and inflation has stayed in check. Whether this positive mix can continue remains to be seen. The Fed has pointed out tariffs as one possible impediment to growth, and any sign of overheating in the economy that moves the inflation dial could put pressure on the Fed to hike rates more quickly.


In June, the Fed’s “dot plot” predicted rates of 3.1% by the end of 2019, up a bit from the Fed’s 2.9% median estimate of a so-called “neutral” rate which neither supports nor slows the economy. The same dot plot expected rates to rise to 3.4% by the end of 2020.


However, Fed Chair Powell signaled that if the economic ship sails into any rocks along the way, perhaps due to factors beyond the Fed’s control such as tariff policy, the Fed might slow the rate of increase. Analysts note it could work the other way as well, Bloomberg News reported, meaning if the recent tax cuts stimulate faster-than-expected growth, the Fed might have to tighten more quickly.


With Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) prices up 2.2% year-over-year as of June, inflation appears to remain just above the Fed’s stated 2% target. However, the Fed has signaled it might let inflation run a little hot in an effort to avoid choking economic growth. With the economy growing 4.1% in Q2, the current rate regime doesn’t appear to be cutting off demand as of yet. However, the housing sector has struggled lately as prices rise and mortgages get more pricey, possibly a sign of higher borrowing costs starting to have an impact. Other economic data, however, continue to look mostly strong.


Now that the Fed’s decision is out, futures prices at the CME point to 90% odds of a rate hike by the time of the Fed’s next meeting in September, and a 66% chance of a fourth rate hike by the end of the year. Those odds are little changed from before the conclusion of this week’s meeting.


Empty Podium: This is going to be one of the very last Fed meetings to conclude without a press conference. Earlier this year, Fed Chair Jerome Powell announced that starting in 2019, press conferences will accompany each Federal Open Market Committee meeting, and that could arguably cause more volatility. Every time a Fed chairman speaks, especially when it’s a Q&amp;A with the media or Congress, it raises the potential that he or she might say something market-moving. So enjoy the relative peace after this FOMC meeting, because someday you might look back fondly.


Target Practice: The Fed funds target rate is now between 1.75% and 2%, with the futures market expecting it to rise to between 2% and 2.25% by September. That puts rates at levels where the Fed historically has liked to see them, roughly between 2% and 5%. The question is how long this might last. It’s been a while since the Fed was able to keep rates in that range for long. For a year-and-a-half between late 2004 and mid-2006, rates climbed from 2% to 5%, but went over 5% in June 2006. Some people look back on the 1990s as a time of economic growth and strong stock markets, but rates were mostly above 5% for most of that period.


Some Fed watchers argue that the so-called “neutral” interest rate might be lower now than in the past, but where exactly that is remains to be seen. Somewhere around 3% (the Fed’s current estimate) might be in the realm of possibility. The Fed’s “dot plot” sees rates reaching that level in 2020, but a lot can happen in two years.


Foreign Cuisine: The U.S. economy weighs heavily in the Fed’s rate decisions, but the background drumbeat of foreign economic performance also plays a big role. At this point, China’s growth engine seems to be encountering some headwinds, and the Shanghai Composite index is down more than 14% year-to-date. The Euro Stoxx 50 Index is also treading water this year, barely up at all since Jan. 1. Both the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) voted to keep rates unchanged at their recent meetings. That means the strong U.S. economy is a bit of an outlier. With German 10-year bund rates below 0.5%, there’s a wide gap with the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which touched 3% Wednesday. The Fed probably doesn’t want U.S. rates to diverge too widely from rates abroad, but it also doesn’t want inflation to get a foothold here. As you can see, Chairman Powell and company have a narrow tightrope to walk.

False,PeeweeTheMoid,1328629929.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_6v2d1,"We need to draw distinction between Greek and Roman naming. Herodotus, as you say, exclusively uses the name Libya.
In book 2 of the *Histories*, he argued that the Nile Delta does not divide ""Asia and Libya"" by this argument:
&gt; ""If, then, my judgment is correct, the Ionians are mistaken in their opinions about Egypt; if, on the other hand, the Ionians are right, I am ready to prove that neither they not the rest of the Greeks know how to count: for they hold that the world consists of three parts – Asia, Europe, and Libya – whereas it is obvious that they should add a fourth, namely the Egyptian Delta, since they do not include it in either Asia or Libya. (2.16, trans. Aubrey de Selincourt, 1954)

Interestingly, this three continent notion persisted. Isidore of Seville, writing around AD 630, stated that 
&gt; For this surrounding Ocean flows around in a circle at all boundaries. However, it is divided into three parts: from which one part is Asia, another Europe, and a third called Africa. 

&gt; Vndique enim Oceanus circumfluens eius in circulo ambit fines. Divisus est autem trifarie: e quibus una pars Asia, altera Europa, tertia Africa nuncupatur. (Etymologiae 14)

But this isn't an apples to apples comparison by any means. When you look at contemporaries, you find that Greeks and Romans used different names for the same place for centuries.

The Romans used a term with varied etymological explanations, variously Latinate, Hebraic, or originating in a local name. The Romans associated it with the Carthaginians and the continent generally, according to [Lewis &amp; Short](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=Africa&amp;la=la&amp;can=africa0&amp;prior=in#lexicon). The Greeks' name derives from their ethnonym for the people living on the west bank of the Nile, according to the [Great Scott](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=*libu%2Fh&amp;la=greek&amp;can=*libu%2Fh0&amp;prior=h\(#lexicon).

When Polybius was writing his history of the Punic Wars in the 2nd century BC, he used the term Libya exclusively to describe activities taking place on that continent. But when the Romans added Carthage's territory to their growing empire, they named it Africa Proconsolaris (not Libya). And Cornelius Scipio's honorific agnomen was ""Africanus"" not based in ""Libya."" 

Furthermore, when Titus Livius described these same events in Latin one hundred years later, he described the same events using ""Africa"" exclusively. In the second and first century BC, we see Greeks using ""Libya"" for all land west of the Nile, and Romans using ""Africa"" to describe the same territory. Sallust used ""Africa"" for the continent as well, in his *[Jugurthine War](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Sal.%20Jug.%2089.7&amp;lang=original)*. Throughout antiquity from Africanus down to Diocletian's designation of Diocese Africa and Justinian's reassertion of the territory as Prefectura Africa. To the Romans, the territory west of Egypt was Africa.

The Greeks persisted in using ""Libya"" in their language. 
Claudius Ptolemy (d. AD 170), the Alexandrian founder of Geography, used the Libya name as well. ""First of all, therefore, let us set down Europe which we separate from Libya by the Straits of Hercules..."" ([Prologue](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Periods/Roman/_Texts/Ptolemy/2/Prologue*.html) to *Geography*). Procopius likewise used ""Libya"" in the *[Secret History](https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/basis/procop-anec.asp)* (c. AD 550). So while Justinian was reestablishing the province as Africa, Procopius was describing the event using the term Libya, parallel to Polybius describing the Romans' conquest of Carthaginian Africa. 

Muslim invaders adopted the Prefecture name, and it appears on maps consistently after the 7th century.

The links explicitly show how the US [**knowingly**](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-12-15/weapons-went-cia-isis-less-two-months-new-study-reveals) carried out a regime change operation that resulted in terrorists being armed as a result of the US and its allies arming the rebels. ISIS got a massive influx of **new weapons** thanks to US policies, this is not debatable, it's in the report.

That you try to equate this with the rebels having some Russian weapons they got through attacking government positions is beyond obtuse. The US armed terrorist linked rebels directly as a policy, US weapons didn't just happen to be found by them.

Furthermore, from the report:

&gt; Moreover, many of these transfers have violated the terms of sale and export agreed between weapon exporters—primarily EU Member States—and recipients in Saudi Arabia and the United States. These are clear cases of diversion, whereby government recipients have broken end-user agreements in which they undertook not to re-export weapons or ammunition without the prior consent of exporting governments. 

&gt; These non-retransfer clauses are explicitly designed to mitigate the risk of diversion and the subsequent use of weapons by insurgent and terrorist forces to the detriment of international peace and security. Their violation runs counter to a range of international and regional counter-diversion agreements, including specific aspects of the Arms Trade Treaty and the EU Common Position on Arms Exports.

While there are social fictions with utility (eg. money and language), race is more in the realm of abstract social fiction than utility.  But if instead you believe that they are all equal, you will have to consider race as important as money and language, and that would logically follow the belief that race is somehow a building block of civilization itself, considering the importance of money and language in that role.

TL;DR - That's the rebuttal that can be used.  Basically, there are constructs that have utility, but then there are those that are so abstract as to not have much utility outside of taxonomy.

There's too much mention of things like the Brightdroids and Subliming for the audience to form any sort of attachment towards. 

The other major issue is that you seem to have a need to explain every aesthetic detail of the OT in the Prequels. Nobody really cares about bulky data tapes versus technologically-advanced AI systems. If you had some backwater planets be more analog, and the Core Worlds more digital, then *maybe* it could serve as a symbol for classism or whatever, but as it stands, several writers just end up spending too much time on needless worldbuilding exposition than developing the characters. 

Other than that, it's a well-developed imaginative recreation of the prequels.

A lot has been said so far but here's my take

In 1798 Jeremy Benthem, a renowned philosopher posed the problem as such - “The question is not, Can they reason?, nor Can they talk? but, Can they suffer? Why should the law refuse its protection to any sensitive being?”

So I think the question is, considering animals feel pain, and considering the pain they feel is just as real to them as ours is to us, don't they deserve moral consideration? 

And if so, aren't their lives worth more than our taste buds?

Fundamentally this line of reasoning is why I myself avoid animal exploitation. 

I also HIGHLY reccommend this video - it's 18 minutes but it's a brilliant deconstruction of how societies relationship with food by a psychologist and activist, Harvard graduate Dr Melanie Joy

“There’s absolutely no reason to suppose that they (animals such as chimps, dogs, cows) feel less pain than we do”

* Environmental concerns - ""Avoiding meat and dairy products is the single biggest way to reduce your environmental impact on the planet, according to the scientists behind the most comprehensive analysis to date of the damage farming does to the planet.
The new research shows that without meat and dairy consumption, global farmland use could be reduced by more than 75% – an area equivalent to the US, China, European Union and Australia combined – and still feed the world. Loss of wild areas to agriculture is the leading cause of the current mass extinction of wildlife.""

I guess she kind of earned this self-cofidence by the prices she has won but it does not sound too sympatic in my ears.
I personally think that there are good ways to get known outside the classic publishing business IF you are brilliant. 
I prefer eurpean-based fantasy myself because i think that the structure of medival european society is a pretty good frame for telling engaging stories because of the personal relationships of feudalism. It is also easier for a reader to get used to a story if the backround is easily understandable. 
A fantasy story based on a more foreign mythologie has to explain its backround much more carfully to keep the focus of the reader. So it might be true that it requires a better author to write such a story.

The constant claim of racism does not help the cause although i personally believe that their is some racism still in modern societies i don`t believe that this is the reason for the focus on european based fantasy. I just think that the potential of a totally economic failure is bigger if you sell mediocore books about unknown cultures because weaker writing is much more obvious if you have to explain the base of your worldbuildung to the audience.

I just read a book about chinese history because i wanted to know the historic personalities in the three body problem but not you will need some interest to history to do that. Otherwise some passages of the book remain more mysterious than they should be just because the reader does not have enoguh knowledge of the backround.

I'm a firefighter/paramedic.   I consciously choose that career because i DIDN'T want to lay in bed at night wondering what the hell i was doing with my life.   Yeah I'll never live the high life, but I'll be ok. 

But in my work i see so many chronic diseases that are what some call diseases of despair.   They are caused by things like poor diet, smoking, drug abuse, unprotected sex, and other reckless behavior, etc that make no sense if you have a hope for a better life, but make a certain kind of sense if you expect your life is going to be one long miserable slide into the darkness. 

And i think I've seen a gradual expansion up the socioeconomic scale from people who have been on the dole for generations, to young college educated people. 

And on one level it makes a kind of sense.  Faith in the ""American Dream"" and institutions has fallen as more and more people don't trust those in power to play fair. 

Europe is a little way ahead of us on this.   After the two world wars destroyed the continent, people sort of gave up on most institutions.   That may not be a bad thing.   They focus more on trying to live good lives, and design societies that encourage that. 

We're in an awkward transition where we're going from being kings of the world to just one more disillusioned prodigal.  

But as George Carlin said, inside every cynic is a disappointed idealist.   And in a weird way, i hope your generation can find common cause in your disillusionment and use that to advance the human condition within our society.   Things DON'T have to be this way, NO ONE lives forever, and there's ALWAYS a better way. 

Good luck, hang in there, and don't be afraid to make a radical change to your life.   In a strange way, having so many options for finding happiness can make you unhappier.  It's like when you go to the grocery store and spend 30 minutes dithering about which of the fifty types of peanut butter is best.  You get into decision fatigue,  FOMO, that sort of thing.

*Europe had been overpopulated before the plague, and a reduction of 30 to 50 percent of the population could have resulted in higher wages and more available land and food for peasants because of less competition for resources [...] initial outbreak of the Black Death had a leveling effect that changed the ratio of land to labor, reducing the value of the former while boosting that of the latter, which lowered economic inequality by making landowners and employers less well off while improving the lot of the workers. He states that ""the observed improvement in living standards of the laboring population was rooted in the suffering and premature death of tens of millions over the course of several generations.""

It's always news about intolerance, war, racism or the absolute abandonment of the poor. While these may be unfortunate parts of the USA, there is much more to it. Thankfully, there are also shows that show the flipside. There's a show in my country about a young man cycling through the United States and talking to people about their country along the way. It's shows like these that hopefully help my fellow countrymen to realize that there are also many kind, level-headed and wonderful people in the USA.

&gt; Two examples that I saw were active recruitment in the streets of Gothenburg by the Nordic Front (nazis), and I was in Gothenburg when a synagogue was firebombed near my hotel.
&gt; I have also experienced situations where professionals have said bigoted things that would never be accepted in a US work environment.

These aren't relatable to me as a Belgian. There's obviously racism here, plenty of it. There's racism everywhere. Still, I don't think we take freedom of speech so literally. There's a political participation ban on hatemongering and racism. We had a fairly popular political party being accused of racism by a court and being prohibited from further political participation. Any kind of racism is big news here, especially if it's public. We even have an antiracism law since 1981 which can be condensed into three parts :

* It's punishable to encourage racism, racial segregation, hate or violence against a group of people based on their skin colour, heritage or nationality.
* It's punishable to publizice an intent towards discrimination, racial segragation, hate or violence against a group of people based on their skin colour, heritage or nationality.
* It's punishable to cooperate or participate with an organisation which repeatedly has announced or executed discrimination or racial segregation.

There are more laws like this, but that's the most important one. These type of laws aren't that uncommon in Western Europe or Scandinavia as far as I know. I honestly think that equality of all living beings and the secularisation of government are two values most heavily supported and seen as quintessentially European by Europeans themselves.

On the fundamental question? It doesn't seem that way, polling hasn't dramatically shifted one way or another if you ask whether the UK should or shouldn't be in the EU after all.

&gt;Practicality and efficiency of decision-making have always been wolf-whistles to dictatorship.

And they have been the basis of democracy too. 

&gt; (If May can call a needless general election for something as inappropriate and unhelpful as party politics then she can also call a second referendum.)

She can, but there is no particularly compelling reason I can see why she would want to, or why it'd be a good thing for her to do so, the calls are broadly coming from one side of the argument (unlike for the initial referendum) and it's questionable whether there is even anything close to majority support for an in/out referendum at all.

Moreover if we end up with a leave vote anyway (which seems fairly likely), all it does is increase uncertainty in the interim, if it leads to a remain vote, you still need parliament to accept it and act. Not to mention that to even run the referendum we'd need legislation, a campaign period and everything else that goes with it  At that point, and given that people are actively lobbying parliament anyway. it'd probably make sense just to let Parliament make any necessary decisions. 

&gt;If delaying or derailing the exit process is what the people want then they should be allowed to express those views. Not silenced by the Brexit 'majority'.

Absolutely, but it doesn't really seem like that is what a majority of people want. Again, before the EU referendum, support for having it went above 80%, I haven't seen a poll suggesting that even close to 50% want another in/out referendum..

&gt;But the Brexit crowd tried to say that Parliament needn't be involved and have consistently attempted to sideline it from any decision-making process or oversight.

I don't think anyone suggested that Parliament needn't be involved, because that'd be absurd. Parliament would need to legislate regardless.  There was an argument that the Government didn't need Parliamentary consent to start the exit process, but obviously that was shown to be wrong and Parliament has been involved..  And if Parliament wants to act on this it can.

&gt;Brexit is a process being imposed on the British people through a tyranny of a slim majority from over 2 years ago to satisfy the illusory desires of some and the very real unpatriotic desires of the upper classes.

The UK is leaving the EU because we had an advisory referendum which returned a slim majority for leave, which was followed by Parliament acting on that advice, followed by a General election that resulted in the election (by a slim margin) of a formally pro-Brexit government, and a formally pro-Brexit opposition. 

As to the motivations for the vote, you may not agree, and you may not like them, but I would be willing to bet that most people (leave and remain) voted for what they felt was best for the country, I'd be wary of labelling my opposition of being unpatriotic, and indeed of misunderstanding motivations to the point of assuming that they were illusory.

&gt; Shakatak is an English jazz-funk band, founded in 1980.

&gt; Shakatak scored a number of chart entries, including two Top Ten hits in the UK Singles Chart, ""Night Birds"" (1982) and ""Down on the Street"" (1984), plus a further 12 entries in the Guinness book of British Hit Singles. The group are still active and popular throughout the world, particularly in Japan and the Far East, and generally produce a new album every two years on JVC Records.

&gt; From their first release in August 1980, (the Bill Sharpe composition ""Steppin'"" on the Polydor record label), and their first album, Drivin' Hard, the band's singles and albums have entered the charts regularly.

&gt; It was the release of ""Easier Said Than Done"" that gave the band the radio exposure needed for their first top-twenty hit. This record introduced their instrumental-unison vocal sound to a much wider audience, and the track stayed in the UK chart for seventeen weeks. The follow-up, ""Night Birds"", was their first single to reach the top ten, and the album of the same name gave Shakatak their first gold album, entering at number four and remaining in the charts for twenty-eight weeks. By now a major international act, the success of the release gave them the number-one jazz album slot in Japan, and attracted interest across Europe and South America. Night Birds was used in the feature film ""Away We Go"" directed by Sam Mendes and was used as the demonstration song on many Casio Piano Keyboards such as the Casio CT-460.

&gt; Two more albums – Invitations and Out of This World – were recorded in 1982 and 1983, resulting in several more chart hits, and paving the way for the next major breakthrough in the band's career. With a subtle change in musical direction, yet still retaining the band's identity, Jill Saward (formerly of Fusion Orchestra, Brandy and Citizen Gang) became their lead singer to make Shakatak's fifth album, Down on the Street. The resulting single releases ""Down on the Street"" and ""Watching You"" had great success, and brought them attention in new parts of the world. The following year saw the release of the group's first live album, which was recorded in both Tokyo and London.

&gt; The seventh album, Day by Day, saw the development of songwriting by all of the band members. In 1986 Saward announced that she was expecting a baby later the same year. This news allowed the band to ease their hectic touring schedule for a while, and enabled them to concentrate purely on recording for a brief period. The band were in the top five foreign acts in Japan, and after winning the coveted Silver Award in the Tokyo International Song Festival, Shakatak were asked to produce an extra album each year exclusively for the Japanese market. By this time they had two extra albums released there entitled Into the Blue and Golden Wings. Both sold well, the latter winning the ""Best Instrumental Album 1987"" at the Japanese Phonograph Record Association Awards.

&gt; However, following this success the band felt it was time that they re-directed their efforts back to singles, and an album for release to the rest of the world. The result was Something Special, closely followed by the night club and chart hit ""Mr Manic &amp; Sister Cool"" from their next LP, Manic and Cool.

&gt; In the 1990s, the band had success in the US when they had two albums that went to No 1 in the contemporary jazz charts, and were also awarded the Japanese grammy for best international instrumental album six years running.

&gt; Shakatak continue to appear regularly throughout the world with recent festival performances at Jakjazz, the Jakata International Jazz Festival, Bangkok, Hua Hin and the Bratislava Jazz Day and they make annual appearances at the Billboard Clubs in Japan and the Pizza Express Jazz Room in London plus numerous other concert and club performances.

&gt; The band celebrated their thirtieth anniversary year in 2010.

&gt; Bassist George Anderson is to release his second solo album 'Expressions' on the 3rd September 2012 through Secret Records. Coming three years after his first album 'Positivity', this album again sees George writing, arranging and producing all of the tracks on it.

&gt; Keyboardist Bill Sharpe worked with American jazz pianist Don Grusin on a joint project called Geography released in 2007. Sharpe's second collaboration with Grusin, Trans Atlantica has been completed and is to be released on the 3rd September 2012. This is to be released through London label Secret Records and will also include their first album Geography as a special 2-CD package. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt;Oriental trousers differ very much in different countries. They are of all possible widths, from wide pantaloons, which are only drawn together at the bottom over the feet, to close-fitting shapes which look more like drawers and indeed are so-called by European travellers. The are also of very different lengths, from knee-breeches, especially for soldiers, to long trousers coming to below the feet. Colours were dependent not only on fashion (at times, only natural colours were considered chic, and artifical colours not at all)...As regards material, a famous Persian speciality was silken trousers; in Egypt and the adjoining lands, the white Egyptian linen was popular, trousers of red leather are mentioned as the dress of the women in the market of lights at Cairo, and so on.

If you go googling for more on sirwal, do *not* go to any site referring to Punjab, Pakistan, or India: those are all modern styles of sirwal, and are **not** period at all. Also, the ""poofy"" sirwal gathered at the ankle are almost all post-period; the only ""gray area"" ""poofies"" are Turkish. And ""harem pants"" are right out.

If you get something out of these books, then that's great - seriously.


*Hard Contact* is perfectly enjoyable, even though I'd have preferred something closer to the game. The characterisatation *actually works* in it because of the setting - they're all behind enemy lines and Etain hasn't had any forwarning of clones and leadership and so on. And there's a vilainous Mandolorian, which fits into the rest of the EU quite nicely and serves to bridge the gap to the Mando PoV a bit more gracefully. Oh, and all of the repetative 'as Skirata had taught them', 'as Skirata said' etc. lines actually work as the clones just have training and Geonosis to fall back on.



Then we get to *Tripple Zero*. I think the main issue with it is actually that the characters just don't fit the plot. (Terroist attacks on Coruscant? Call Jax Pavan, he'll sort it). *Hard Contact* could work as a mission in the game, with minor modification. *Tripple Zero*, though? Not so much.


*Tripple Zero* also, notably, is when Skirata appeared in the story himself. And he takes it over completely, to the point that the titular Republic Commandos are tertiary characters behind Skirata and his edgey 'private army'. And there are *so very many* clone main characters with the exact same personality - really ironic considering how much Traviss pushes the 'clones are individuals' line.


*Tripple Zero* also suffers from being set a year after *Hard Contact* in that no changes in characterisation seem to have ocurred over the interim - is Etain now a confident, self assured Knight? No, she's exactly the same as ever.


Traviss and her characters are at her best when away from authority, but the means by which they're placed there are often very clumsy. 

Her portrayals of other people's characters are universally awful, and any Jedi in her books frankly do not belong in the Order. 

Oh, and she's also proof that female authours can be really sexist (all authority figures in all her books are male).

Etain Tur-Mukan is again a primary example. The narrative (and Skirata) constantly comment on how surprising it is she can do anything considering how 'small', 'young' and 'inexperienced' she is (read: they're surprised a woman can do anything), despite the fact that everything she does is either because a male character has told her to (including *giving up her child* to be raised as a soldier, the *exact same* upbringing she says is 'wrong' when done to the clones) or because she's seeking male validation.

All her other female characters are either waitresses, dancers, secretaries or 'femme fatale' types.

False,gradeplg,1502306668.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_9y4piob,"&gt;The comment I replied to was not about all gun violence. Mass shootings were mentioned, specifically, as occurring far less in countries with stricter gun laws, which, although technically true, is a misguided statement that fails to understand what the statistics really mean. The fundamental problem with the statement, “These kinda of shootings don’t happen in other countries,” boils down to two things:
1.	⁠The US is fucking huge, far larger both geographically and by population than any individual nation in the EU. Regardless of what the numbers actually say, it should be obvious that the US experiences more deaths by mass public shootings than any individual EU nation.
2.	⁠When we compare deaths by mass shootings in individual countries in the EU to individual states in the US, we see that comparably-sized populations in Europe and in the US experience comparable levels of mass public shootings.

Well let's also not ignore some things.

1. Europe has been targeted much more by foreign terror attacks (partially due to the fact they are simply closer to the Middle East) so their statistics are inflated.

2. That doesn't address my criticism of deaths being a bad way to measure things. Certainly there are quite a few places in the US that are experts at saving victims of gun violence because of the frequency with which it occurs there. Certainly they are more likely to save a victim than doctor in Europe that could be considered relatively inexperienced. 

3. Most European nations have by far and away a greater population density than the United States.

&gt;First, I think gun violence is, inherently, a bullshit statistic in exception of mass public shootings. It immediately casts blame on firearms, which seems logical, at first. Guns are weapons designed to kill. However, violence is violence, regardless of the means of perpetration. Fundamentally, it makes no difference if gun violence decreases if general violence isn’t also reduced dramatically. There are no reputable or academic studies of which I’m aware that analyze this relationship, however, so we will be focusing on “gun violence” or “gun homicide”.

Gun violence isn't exclusive to people who intend to commit violence. Accidental discharges, toddlers shooting other kids (yes this happens), and suicide. You can argue maybe some of these incidents might have happened even if it wasn't a gun, but there's also cases where this definitely wouldn't have happened if there wasn't a gun involved (if it was a knife or other object). Also let's not pretend like it isn't easier to kill with a gun than a knife or other object.

&gt;Once we’ve adjusted for suicides and accidents, we still see around 12,000 gun homicides each year. More than half of these deaths are young men, the majority of whom are black. This shows us that gun homicide is most prevalent in low-income, disenfranchised areas and neighborhoods, where crime and gang-related activity is higher. While I’m not necessarily a proponent of, “But it’s gonna happen anyway,” I will argue that (thus far) no proposed gun control legislation will reduce these numbers.

That's not realistic. How many of those kids might not have committed suicide without a gun? How many might have attempted a different way and survived? To pretend like the gun has zero sway on suicide attempts is disingenuous. Also, how do you know that any proposed legislation would do nothing? The majority of legislation on the national level has been blocked by special interests.

&gt;We haven’t even scratched the surface of other issues, such as the sheer number of guns already in circulation, the rampant gun culture in the United States, approaching the issue in the face of the Second Amendment’s existence, or the positives to gun ownership (such as self-defense, defense of property/self against wildlife, etc). I don’t oppose gun control as a concept. It’s an ideology with noble intent that fails to put forth a pragmatic solution to the immensely complex issue that is American gun violence.

People have been brainwashed through partisan hacks that demonize gun control for their monetary interests, and that's why a lot of this stuff doesn't get through. Let's get that out of the way.  Also, nobody has been allowed to experiment with national gun control. It's easy to say ""nothing is going to work"" when nothing has been allowed to work. People need to stop being so uptight. We still don't have UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS. FFS. Even the most basic of legislation gets shot down by idiots screaming about having their guns taken away and politicians trying to grandstand on the issue because they know their voters support them/don't care.",True,False,False,,0,1533170705,,False,0,e3g4lki,False,t3_93r03p,True,t1_e3g2858,/r/MemeEconomy/comments/93r03p/versatile_format/e3g4lki/,,1536982839,3,True,False,MemeEconomy,t5_3gl3k,r/MemeEconomy,public,

http://berserk.wikia.com/wiki/Ys

&gt;Ys (pronounced /ˈiːs/ EESS) is an isolationist principality on the ""northern frontier"", surrounded by ocean. It has a history of shipbuilding and seafaring, and naturally one of the strongest navies in the known world.

this is the homeland of roderick, the man who arranges a marriage to farnese. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ys

To protect Ys from inundation, a dike was built with a gate that was opened for ships during low tide. The one key that opened the gate was held by the king


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradlon

&gt;Later, Dahut had a key role in the story of Ys, a city built below sea level and protected by a gate that kept the sea out. Dahut turned the city into a place of sin and debauchery. One night she stole the key to the gate from her sleeping father and drunkenly opened the gate. Gradlon awoke and rescued his daughter from the drowning city on his magical horse, but her sins kept dragging them into the sea before he could reach land. In the end Saint Winwaloe told him to drop his daughter. She was swallowed by the sea, becoming a form of siren or morgen, luring men to destruction

this last part is a bit ridiculous, and is marked ""needs citation""

&gt;At Gradlon's death, his son Salomon the 1st succeeded him, then his grandson, Aldrien.

&gt;The city of Ys was famed throughout Europe for its beautiful gardens and buildings but over time its reputation fell into disrepute. This came about through the pagan practices of Dahut.  Unlike her father who had been converted to Christianity by Saint Winwaloe, Dahut and many of the city dwellers retained their pagan ways and worshiped the old gods.  Dahut would swim naked in the sea around the walls of the city and preside at ceremonies dedicated to it which were attended by all of its citizens and people came from far and wide to participate.

&gt;It did not take long before  the city came to be seen as a safe haven for pagans to practice their rituals and beliefs and they flocked there.  The city grew rich and prosperous and many fine buildings and gardens were built and it became renowned as the most beautiful city in the world. 


&gt;Dahut was rumoured to take lovers to her bed and in a perverse sort of game made them wear a black satin mask.  Just after midnight springs fitted inside the mask would grip the victim’s throat strangling them.  Later, a dark figure would be seen leaving her chamber carrying a heavy bundle and placing it on a horse, then riding to the cliff tops and throwing it into the sea.  It was believed, rightly or wrongly, that the victim had been sacrificed to the sea who Dahut worshiped.  

&gt;One day, to the great excitement of Dahut, a handsome knight dressed all in red rode through the city gates and up to the palace.  Dahut was intrigued by the handsome stranger and went to great pains to introduce herself to him offering all the hospitality the city could provide.  She soon became besotted with him and he teased her asking what she would do to prove her love for him. The pair ate and drank and made merry and when night came Dahut took him to her bed chamber.  Because she was so besotted by the Red Knight she did not make him wear the mask.  That night a great storm rolled in from the sea and broke over the city.  Great waves battered the sea walls and gates but could not break through due to their strength and width.

she takes the key from her father at the red knight's behest

&gt;As soon as she gives him the key reveals himself as the devil.  In some versions of the story it is the devil who then opens the gates in others it is the drunken Dahut who does the deed.  Either way it is disastrous for the city as great waves flow, into the city drowning everything and everybody in its path.

it appears that there is a game series themed on this legend: (named Ys)

&gt;A feature of the early Ys games is the Darm Tower (or Dahm Tower in some translations). In the story, it is an unfinished and deserted tower, built with the intention of touching the sky. The tower houses a small annex, titled ""the Tower of Rado"" (or simply ""Rado's Annex""[3]) three quarters of the way up.

&gt;According to in-game lore, the normally immortal ancient Ys aged because humans overused the magic power of an ancient artifact, known as the Black Pearl. The result of this misuse was evil magical energy bringing forth millions of cruel demons. The people of Ys fled to the Palace of Solomon and used the Black Pearl to lift the palace into the sky, creating a safe haven. The demons, focused on controlling the Black Pearl for their own intentions, began building the Darm Tower, day and night, attempting to connect to the Palace of Solomon with their construction. As in-game-events transpired, however, the demons' efforts were thwarted.

There is nothing tangible supporting that view; it's been formed by attempts to whitewash the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

A sense of urgency? That would be absurd. Operation Downfall was theoretically 3 months away, and in reality probably more than a year away. 

The Japanese refusal to unconditionally surrender was a moot point by late summer of 1945 anyway(it's been a moot point since Yalta in fact, February 1945, when the USSR and the US secured the terms of the Soviet invasion of the Japanese Empire after Germany's surrender). 

Japan was unwilling to surrender because their Empire was still large by August 1945 so they had the leverage to demand lighter surrender terms. They pretty much lost only SWPA, but still had Korea, huge parts of China, and Indochina(and Japan itself of course). They didn't have a ""fight 'til the end"" mentality, they already knew they lost the war by then and were willing to admit defeat. They realized that they would have to give up the colonial possessions they captured from the European countries, like Indochina, but they were fighting on to maintain control over their core colonies; specifically Manchuria and Korea, where 1,500,000 Japanese settler-colonists were living and where the Japanese government was planning to send millions more. An unconditional surrender would have meant all of Japan's colonies being taken over by the Allies, not just the ones Japan captured during WWII.

They didn't turn their minds around and unconditionally surrender on 15 August because of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. They turned their minds around and unconditionally surrendered on 15 August because on 9 August, the Soviet Union declared war on the Empire of Japan and 89 Soviet divisions invaded Manchuria and wiped the floor with the million-strong Kwantung Army of Japan and other military units in Manchuria.

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Manchuria_1945-A.PNG
By 15 August, it became absolutely clear that the Japanese troops in Manchuria were incapable of putting up any sort of effective resistance. Manchuria was going to be lost within a week, and Korea would be lost in September after the Soviets' logistical trail caught up. Moreover, the bulk of the Japanese Army in the colonies was lost too. The Soviets stripped the Japanese of any leverage they held to negotiate a peace treaty and captured the colonies for which Japan was continuing to fight, making an immediate unconditional surrender the only option.

Hiroshima and Nagasaki did not play a significant part in it.

&gt; BRUSSELS - Brussels journalists covering the European Union have complained that Belgium is breaching media freedom after being told they will have to pay 50 euros to cover the next summit of EU leaders.

&gt; The Belgian journalists association AGJPB said close to 1,000 journalists would be affected and called it a breach of media freedom.

&gt; Journalists accredited to the EU institutions have free access to the headquarters of the Council and Commission in Brussels but special security for summits means journalists and other visitors need additional six-monthly vetting to attend.

As far as I know, there is no passage which abrogates Quran 9:5. 

The context of his time doesn’t change anything, in my opinion. Jesus was ahead of his time. In the same way, Muhammad, a prophet of god no less, should have been far ahead of his time. Not only that, but he evidently knew what he was doing was evil as he condemned it. He condemned owning slaves, but owned slaves himself. He preached tolerance and equality, but treated others as less than his Muslim self.

You can’t preach peace and commit violence. That makes you a hypocrite. Not practicing what you preach is exactly what being a hypocrite means. Muhammad was a hypocrite.

If you look at the second part of my title, you would see that I argue Islam is not only violent, but also violates human rights. 

Yes, not all Muslim countries have the death penalty for homosexuality. That doesn’t change the fact that most Muslim countries violate human rights and criminalize homosexuality. The death penalty argument just shows how extreme Islam authority is in many countries.

I do not know how many sharia courts are operating in America. America hasn’t allowed so many refugees in, so Islam hasn’t been able to spread like it has been in Europe.

I haven’t made this argument difficult on myself...whatever that means. When I argue that Islam is violent, it doesn’t mean it can’t be peaceful. It means that Islam is generally violent and commits human rights violations. If you want to change my mind you have to prove either that 1. Islam is not inherently violent, 2. Muhammad is not evil, 3. Islam authority does not commit human rights violations on a regular basis or 4. At a pace unalike any other religion.

No, I do not think all American muslims are violent. In fact, most Muslims I know personally are very kind people. I never said muslims were violent. I said Islam and Islamic authority is violent.

That only makes sense if you subscribe to two assumptions that one can be ahead on one's time and that the assertions of Islam are real. I don't subscribe to either. A person cannot be ahead of their time because without that person's contributions there's no guarantee that the values they subscribe to will be the values commonly subscribed to in the future.

&gt;You can’t preach peace and commit violence. That makes you a hypocrite. Not practicing what you preach is exactly what being a hypocrite means. Muhammad was a hypocrite.

Muhammad didn't preach complete peace and non-violence at all times. He preached a general idea of peace but that violence was ok in certain situations, e.g. self-defense and jihad.

But you would agree that if there are more than 2 Muslims in the US? And if there are more than 2 Muslims in the US and Islam was an inherently violent religion they would have to form a violent Sharia court to solve their disputes. 

&gt;I haven’t made this argument difficult on myself...whatever that means. When I argue that Islam is violent, it doesn’t mean it can’t be peaceful.

Yes it does. You can argue that Islam is a mostly violent religion or that it is an almost completely violent religion, but those are different arguments than we're having now. You say that it is violent which means that every iteration of it is violent. If I say a ball is blue when part of it is green I am wrong.

We can only name things we see, like meta, Wolf is subbed for Effort while he used to be the shotcaller, the toplaner, Untara not stealing shirts anymore,… 

And you have to admit that the identity of SKT changed completely, they went from complete experimenting (funnels that failed, Bang on ap, …) earlier this split when Faker was playing and thus frantically searching for a way to make it work to a more classic style with Pirean. Maybe they also would have lost a lot of those games with Pirean while having better teamsynergy.

Before Pirean was subbed in, against KT  with Faker, they also went back to that classic style and game 1 they crushed it and even game 2 it worked and they just lost on that baron. Game 3 they completely collapsed though. But if they played like that from the start of spring split they would have had a lot more wins with either midlaner.  
I honestly don't think this is player, or playstyle related but coaching, coachexperience, practice, pick and bans and yes, maybe burn outs from people or personal problems between them. (like Blossom was rated annoying people for being hyperactive and really noisy).

So with what they are doing now they are just trying to make due, regardless of what they will do after the split,  and trying to get play-offs any way they can while taking the storm of not playing Faker etc. Just imagine how demotivating it must be to have to carry the team in the jungle now while it's stated by your coaching staff, casters and the world, that you are the problem.

Europe PMC
Regular usage of cosmetic products and drugs in dermatological vehicles may cause irritant contact dermatitis. For example, aluminum chloride (AlCl3), the most efficacious antiperspirant salt to treat hyperhidrosis, shows high irritancy potential. To mitigate the irritant contact dermatitis caused by topical application of products containing AlCl3, we investigated the anti-irritating effects of aloe extract and taurine in vitro and in vivo. In an in vitro experiment, reconstructed human epidermis model, EpiDerm, was tested with AlCl3 in the presence or absence of taurine and aloe extract. In a human clinical study, 12 adult subjects were tested with two products, a commercial AlCl3 antiperspirant product and a prototype 12% AlCl3 formulation containing 0.1% taurine and 0.1% aloe extract. Skin irritation potential in vitro and in vivo was measured by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-1α, and chemokine, IL-8. Taurine and aloe extract significantly (p &lt; 0.05) reduced IL-lα and IL-8 production in vitro and in vivo after topical application of formulations containing AlCl3. The blend of taurine and aloe extract demonstrated boosted anti-irritation benefits on AlCl3 irritated skin both in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that the combination of these anti-irritating actives may possibly be effective in mitigating irritant contact dermatitis caused by other dermatological vehicles containing irritating agents, but further research is warranted to assess their effects.",True,False,False,,0,1533191402,,False,0,e3gkajs,True,t3_93wvva,True,t3_93wvva,/r/Hyperhidrosis/comments/93wvva/something_to_try_for_skin_irritation_from_topical/e3gkajs/,,1536990156,2,True,False,Hyperhidrosis,t5_2rhwk,r/Hyperhidrosis,public,

Regular beef is available at most chain retailers, but it can vary wildly in quality and is generally not particularly good. There's plenty of restaurants that know how to prepare beef if you're up for that as well, a personal favorite of mine is Crystal Steak House (they've got Angus beef from Bulgaria, Australia, the States, and Argentina if I remember correctly). I don't know if there are any steakhouses around that offer Wagyu/Kobe beef (in fact I believe it might be illegal to import into the EU because of slaughterhouse regulations which Wagyu/Kobe producers do not cover, but I'm not sure).

[You're under estimating launch cadence by about half](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_spaceflight)

We did fall to about one a week in the years after Columbia but have since picked up. In 2014 we hit 92 (the highest since the early 90s), though 2015 &amp; 2016 were down from that bit 2017 had 91.

This year we've had 63 so far - by comparison a number not reached until late September/Oct in recent years. We have somewhere in the neighborhood of 180 planned this year - though some will invetably be pushed to 2019 it represents something of a record and I would be unsurprised to see us hit 140ish 

The increase is being driven by declining lauch costs (thanks spaceX) with several rockets capable of 2-3k/kg compared to 10k/kg just a few years ago. The net result has been a shift from monolithic Geo stationary sats to large constellations in LEO/MEO which require far more launches.
 
We also have private start ups throwing their hat into the ring with rocket lab doing their small cube sat electron rocket at 5 million (actually really expesive on a per kg basis but a obtainable for those not wanting to wait for a ride share) add to that land space (chineese company), laucher one, vector ect.. all small lauchers.

We also have the chineese space agency maturing and reaching a respectable cadence. India with their PSLV and GSLV rockets, Japan's HII and even Europes Ariane all achieving sig reliability and cost reduction.

We should reach 1960s level cadence this year or next (120-150) and baring some large scale disaster should reach about 200/yr by the mid 2020s

If you're into museums, i might have some pointers :D

First of all: BUY A [BRUSSELS CARD](https://visit.brussels/en/sites/brusselscard/)! You can choose for how long (i think it's 24/48/72 hours), you can choose to combine with free public transport and discounts to lots of other stuff. Check the website for all info.

Museums:

\*\*1. Art &amp; History Museum\*\*

Of course everybody knows there is only one museum in Brussels you \*\*must\*\* see: the [Art &amp; History Museum](http://www.artandhistory.museum) (no, i am not biased, you're biased). It's located in Cinquantenaire Park, a really nice park to chill and picknick right next to the European quarter. You can get here by taking metro lines 1 (direction Stokkel) or 5 (Hermann-Debroux), get off at either Schumann or Merode.

It's a bit of a challenge to find the entrance to the Art &amp; History Museum (signalisation is not really good at the moment), but if you go to the esplanade in the centre of the parc, face the arch, go through the arch, stick to the left and walk around the building, you'll end up at the entrance (you'll pass the entrance for schools which will be closed, this doesn't mean the museum is closed. Just keep going, you'll see the entrance round the corner).

If you like history, you can easily spend a whole day in just the permanent collections of our museum. We go from prehistory right up to art nouveau and art deco, and cover almost all continents (only Africa is missing, you'll have to go to Tervuren for that). The architecture of our buildings alone is a reason to visit.

\*\*2. Musical Instrument Museum\*\*

[Right in the centre of Brussels](https://goo.gl/maps/scCWwsqWYBB2), not to far from the Grande Place/Grote Markt, in one of the most beautiful art nouveau buildings Brussels has to offer. It's dedicated to -who would have guessed- musical instruments and the history of music. Extensive collection, a visit of about 2 hours.

At the top there's a restaurant (you can visit without buying a ticket to the museum) with a really excellent view over Brussels.

\*\*3. Halle Gate\*\*

Last surviving gate of the Medieval walls of Brussels, it has a neat little museum inside. Not very well known, but a nice visit anyway (takes about an hour). Can be found [here](https://goo.gl/maps/yATW1YozeA42).

If you have deep pockets and no or medium DIY skills: go to Colora and get advise. They sell BOSS paints exclusively. You can get BOSS in other places, cheaper in some cases (not a lot). But Colora is very knowledgeable about their products. They will set you up with proper brushes, rollers and tape as well. You will pay A LOT, but the paint is totally worth it.

There are some edge cases where I'd prefer other brands (mainly varnishes or lacquer for wood like for instances stairs), but you get very good results with BOSS paints.

My father for instance did our ceilings with only 2 layers : primer and 1 layer of BOSS Top Mat. Which is absolutely bonkers if you look at the end result. If you don't paint for a living, you will need more layers.

Also, some colors just need A LOT of layers. We have a mustard yellow wall in our house and it needed three layers of BOSS's Bolatex paint. Which is one of the cheaper (older) latex paints from BOSS, still very good.

If you're on a budget :
Wait until GAMMA, HUBO, Brico, Brico Plan-it or one of your local shops runs a promotion on one of the brands. I'd advise Levis in a heartbeat, no problem with their paints. Other brands I have less experience with. Dulux is upper scale paint in the UK, but in mainland Europe it is considered a budget brand for instance. So I wouldn't be surprised if they use different formulas based on location.

SPS is a good dutch brand I recently used 20 liters of SPS resimat which is stupid strong but VERY mat paint.

If you need painting advise like : what tape, what brush go to Colora.

Oh and also, buying pre mixed colors that are in stock is always cheaper than letting them be mixed to spec.

I swear by the following products :

Tape : pink TESA tape for general purpose, yellow for lacquer or when it needs to stay for longer than a week. White 3M safe release tape to put on freshly painted parts.

Brushes and rollers :
ANZA all the way. Don't cheap out on a roller! You could paint a whole house with just 1 roller and 1 brush. I'd get a few brushes. Mostly round pointy ones. Bigger, flatter to put a lot of paint on, fine, round pointy if you want to get into corners. Get the universal ones for instance ANZA platinum.

Paint :
Too many to list here but I got great results with :
Levis Keuken &amp; Badkamer
SPS resimat
All BOSS paints
All Sigma paints

Dogma was a watch brand produced in the period 1860-1970 by the Fabr.d'Horl Clémence Freres &amp; Cie. (later - A. Dorsaz &amp; Cie.) in La Chaux de Fonds, Switzerland. This one is a well-known ""watch-city"", where local watch-making culture dates back to the 17th century and is still alive to this very day. It seems that the company started making watches as early as 1860 since in the 60's of the 20th century they celebrated their 100th anniversary (check the vintage ad in the uploaded photos). 

In 1909 the company struck a deal with a watch/gold retailer Siegmund Neumann who had several stores in Basel and Luxemburg. It's very likely that later on, during the World War II this cooperation helped them become one of the Swiss manufacturers making ""Dienstuhren"" or Service watches for the Wehrmacht and the Luftwaffe. Some of their watches from that period are Landeron movements, but they mostly used the Anton Schild (AS) 1130 movement as most of the other comparable German Service Watches providers did - Phenix, Freco, Bulla, Glycine, Helma, Choisi, Nisus, Midi, Era, Flora, Gala, Onda, BWC, Pront, etc. Their pieces during the war were with superb quality. After the war - in 1949, the company was re-registered and the brand was transferred to the Fabrique d'Horlogerie Arthus Dorsaz &amp; Co. They started selling Dogma on their own all over Western Europe. Not much additional info on them during the 50-60s except from October 1956 - the company filled a trademark infringement case agains a rival brand - Dog. Brand made by the Redia watch co. mainly for selling it in Tangier. The case was won by Arthur Dorsaz &amp; Co.

Overall during their whole lifespan the Dogma watches stand for fairly priced, decent quality pieces. Known movements they've used in the 30s, 40s and 50s are FHF 2124, Anton Schild (AS) 1130, Landeron (39, 47, 48, 149), Fleurier (FEF 290) and ETA (853). During the 60's the company was still on the market, but only a handfull of Dogma pieces with Valjoux 7733 have resurfaced, so it's very likely that the company has fallen a victim of the Swiss “Quartz Crisis”.
Last known info on the brand itself is from 1972 when Aubry Frères SA acquired the rights to it. In 2008 the brand reappeared in Madrid, Spain as a low-end designer pieces made by Brit Watch Internacional, S.L. The ""new Dogma"" is using the old logo and claiming to have inherited the old company (this time established in 1897). They are still around and making cheap Rolex and Hublot knockoffs with questionable quality and cheap ETA movements.

""Crise de la masculinité"" : après #Metoo, comment être un homme ?
Le Bailly, David

La déferlante féministe post-Weinstein a définitivement ébranlé le modèle patriarcal. Au fil des débats, c'est l'essence même de la virilité qui a été questionnée. Une crise identitaire provoquant une prise de conscience, et qui pourrait à terme rétablir l'équilibre entre les genres.

S'il fallait retenir un seul signe du malaise des hommes en Occident, c'est bien leur silence lors de la déferlante #Metoo. Alors que des milliers de femmes dénonçaient les abus de pouvoir et les agressions sexuelles dont elles disaient avoir été victimes, eux sont restés muets, tétanisés. On aurait pourtant aimé les entendre, nos philosophes, nos romanciers, nos cinéastes !

""L'Obs"" a d'emblée soutenu le mouvement #Metoo. Mais, lors des conférences de rédaction, les hommes préféraient passer leur tour quand le sujet venait sur la table. Dans toute la presse, les articles consacrés au mouvement étaient presque exclusivement écrits par des femmes. A coups de tribunes, des intellectuelles s'interpellaient sur la notion de consentement ou sur une possible ""liberté d'importuner""...

Au Festival international de Journalisme qui vient de se tenir à Couthures, un débat intitulé ""Faut-il se libérer de la virilité ?"" réunissait quatre femmes et un seul homme, le sociologue Raphaël Liogier, qui partage les arguments néoféministes. Dans ""Descente au coeur du mâle"" (Les Liens qui libèrent), écrit au moment de la vague #Metoo, ce dernier explore les racines de la domination masculine et expose son propre inconfort :

""A mesure que je me plongeais dans les témoignages de femmes harcelées, voire violées, j'éprouvais une sensation de dégoût. Le dégoût s'est progressivement transformé en malaise. Ces hommes sont dégueulasses, certes. Souvent pitoyables. Beaucoup sont des salauds sans vergogne. Mais surtout ce sont des hommes comme moi. [...] Même si je n'ai pas voulu l'avouer immédiatement, une partie de mon identité virile m'était renvoyée en plein visage.""

De façon générale, les hommes se retrouvaient auscultés comme des cas pathologiques, des personnes à rééduquer. Il aura fallu attendre plusieurs mois avant d'entendre des voix masculines à contre-courant du discours ambiant. Le réalisateur allemand Michael Haneke (deux fois palme d'or à Cannes) pouvait s'indigner contre ""un nouveau puritanisme empreint d'une haine des hommes : bien sûr, toute forme de viol ou de contrainte sexuelle doit être sanctionnée. Mais je trouve l'hystérie et les condamnations sans procès auxquelles on assiste aujourd'hui tout à fait dégoûtantes"".

Récemment, ce fut au tour de Jean-Pierre Le Goff de dénoncer sur France-Culture "" un climat de suspicion généralisée. [...] Le risque, c'est que les rapports hommes-femmes soient uniquement considérés sous l'angle de la domination et de l'aliénation avec un schéma comportementaliste : une innocente victime face à un pur salaud. Je pense que les choses sont plus compliquées que ça"". Et le philosophe de pointer du doigt ""la crise de la masculinité"" :

""Le patriarcat, je veux bien qu'il reste, mais il a quand même été bien entamé. On fait comme si on était toujours au XIXe siècle ! On ne peut pas raisonner comme si on était encore dans la situation de familles ordonnées autour d'un père. Quand vous voyez toutes les familles monoparentales ou recomposées... ""

""Crise de la masculinité"" : le sujet est dans l'air depuis longtemps. Le silence des hommes sur #Metoo est le signe d'un désarroi, mais plus encore d'une impuissance. C'est le paradoxe de ce mouvement : dénoncer une société patriarcale au moment même où celle-ci est pour le moins déstabilisée. Dans la sphère familiale, à l'intérieur du couple, et plus généralement dans l'ensemble de la société. La revue ""le Débat"", qui vient de consacrer un numéro spécial au ""Masculin en révolution"", ne s'y est pas trompée. Son rédacteur en chef, Marcel Gauchet, y proclame non sans provocation ""la fin de la domination masculine"". A le lire, elle serait ""morte dans son principe"". Parmi les explications de ce phénomène anthropologique selon lui majeur, il y a bien sûr l'explosion de la famille traditionnelle, organisée autour de la figure mythologique d'un père à l'autorité incontestable. Et les prochaines tentatives du gouvernement d'étendre la procréation médicalement assistée (PMA) aux femmes homosexuelles ou célibataires devraient encore raviver le débat autour de la place des hommes.

Autorité parentale conjointe

Tuer le père : le phénomène est loin d'être nouveau. Sur le plan juridique, cela fait près d'un demi-siècle que, dans le Code civil, la notion de ""puissance paternelle"" a été abolie au profit de celle d'"" autorité parentale conjointe "". Pour Marcel Gauchet, cet écroulement de la figure paternelle ""a été accueilli sans déplaisir par le plus grand nombre des intéressés. Jamais dominants ne se seront accommodés avec autant d'aisance de l'abandon de leurs prérogatives. La vérité est qu'il a été le soulagement d'un fardeau pour eux aussi"". Peut-être. Mais sans ces ""prérogatives"", longtemps présentées comme ""naturelles"", que reste-t-il aux hommes ? Quelles valeurs portent-ils ? Et surtout à quoi servent-ils ? Dans ""le Figaro"", l'écrivaine américaine Nancy Huston faisait remarquer :

""Au long des dizaines de milliers d'années de l'évolution de notre espèce, les femmes ont choisi les hommes forts pour protéger leur progéniture, et cette sélection sexuelle a eu pour effet d'augmenter la force et l'agressivité des hommes. On demande l'impossible aux hommes. On leur demande d'être forts et faibles, durs et attentionnés, puissants et sans pitié dans le monde du travail, et doux comme des agneaux à la maison. Comment être un homme face à toutes ces demandes contradictoires : c'est ce que j'appelle la virilité vrillée.""

Si la campagne #Metoo a mis en lumière la question du pouvoir et des abus sexuels, elle n'est pas allée jusqu'à remettre en question une représentation féminine de la virilité et de ses attributs (statut social, fortune, force physique) ni la répartition des rôles dans le jeu amoureux, comme l'illustre le débat autour du consentement féminin (qui, selon certains, revient à graver dans le marbre ce principe sexiste : ""l'homme propose, la femme dispose"".)

Ce qui fait dire au philosophe Gilles Lipovetsky, toujours dans la revue ""le Débat"", que #Metoo n'a rien d'une nouvelle révolution sexuelle. ""Il est très significatif qu'elle ne se soit pas accompagnée de la revendication égalitaire, de la part des femmes, à devenir aussi entreprenantes, aussi actives que les hommes en matière d'avance sexuelle. [...] Elle permettra sans doute de changer quelques comportements masculins, mais elle n'appelle pas les femmes à changer leurs propres manières de se conduire en matière de vie sexuelle et de séduction érotique.""

Examen de conscience

Dans la sphère intime aussi, la thèse de Pierre Bourdieu sur la domination masculine a du plomb dans l'aile. Lors de la dernière grande enquête sur la sexualité en France menée par le sexologue Philippe Brenot (2011), 44% des femmes en couple se disaient sexuellement très satisfaites, contre 33% des hommes. 70% d'entre elles jugeaient désormais les préliminaires suffisamment longs - tandis que 60% des hommes disaient craindre par-dessus tout de décevoir leur partenaire. Philippe Brenot résume :

""La majorité des hommes d'aujourd'hui sont très attentifs à des valeurs de séduction qui conviennent mieux aux femmes. Ils se livrent davantage par la parole, ils tentent d'écouter - même si c'est parfois difficile - et cherchent le dialogue. [...] Les hommes sont devenus plus ouverts, mais aussi plus fragiles. C'est d'ailleurs ce que beaucoup de femmes leur reprochent.

Now US cars have been big and heavy for a very long time, cars in the tailfin era were already in the 1,500-2,500kg range.

A first generation VW Golf from the 1970s weighed 800-900 kg, the modern version weighs 500kg more, is 20 cm wider and 70 cm longer.

&gt; 
&gt; Referring to ""some strange, weird incidents involving Tampere people"" at the games played in Coimbra, Manuel Machado said that in Turkey in April 2014, when it was learned that Coimbra had defeated Tampere, he noted that ""the environment was an excessive aggression "".
&gt; 
&gt; The leader of the local government even said that the defeated ""have been upset"" because Coimbra won, which will have been verified in loco by the mayor, the councilwoman of Culture and the Rector of the University of Coimbra.
&gt; 
&gt; We recall that the organization of the European University Games confirmed that ""After the complaint of the Finnish athlete, the case was immediately reported by the security of the organization to the police who arrived there 15 minutes later, having identified and questioned the alleged victim and aggressor.""
&gt; 
&gt; According to the European University Games ""The case is already in the DIAP and the Games Organization is collaborating with the Public Prosecutor's Office in order to obtain all the documentation about the case, such as the security report of the event and the procedures taken by the organization "".
&gt; 
&gt; The fourth edition of the European University Games took place between 15 and 28 July, in Coimbra, with the participation of some 3150 athletes, representing 295 universities from 40 countries, which were housed ""out there"".
&gt; 
&gt; EUG 2018 was organized by the Coimbra University, the Coimbra Academic Association, the Coimbra City Council and the Academic Sports University Federation.
&gt; 
&gt; Coimbra applied for the second time to receive this large European competition, having been defeated by the candidacy of Zagreb and Rijeka in Croatia for the 2014 EUSA Games organization.
&gt; 
&gt; In 2014, in Denizli, Turkey, Coimbra was luckier and managed to defeat the Finns of Tampere.
&gt; 
&gt; We would like to remind you that the announcement of the winner of the bid for the Games, which also took place in the Finnish city of Tampere, was made on 5 April 2014 during the gala of the annual meeting of the European association, attended by representatives of the Academic Association of Coimbra (AAC), the Coimbra Municipal Council (CMC) and the University of Coimbra (UC), leading institutions of the Portuguese candidature, as well as the then Secretary of State for Sport.

Yes. Rule of thumb is that you fall under the social security law of the country where you work. There are some exceptions, though, like postings or Beamte. As I said, for details it's best to check out the relevant EC Regulation No 883/2004. The general rule is in Article 11, and the special cases are in the following articles.

However, you still get your health and unemployment insurance benefits from an institution in your country of residence. The insurance carrier in your country of residence then charges the insurance carrier in the country where you work. So I pay my health insurance premiums to a Swiss insurer, but I also have a German health insurance card for use in Germany with a somewhat special status and I get the same benefits as any member of the German statutory health insurance in Germany. That card is only visually different from the usual German health insurance cards in that there is no EHIC on the back side - rather, the EHIC is printed on my Swiss insurance card and I have to use that one in any EU country other than Germany.

Thats just means a person knows what he is doing is criminal or what someone else is doing is criminal. Mens rea is intent. A person must be consenting and aware he is commiting a crime. Its irrelevant to this. 

&gt;&gt;Mens rea (/ˈmɛnz ˈriːə/; Law Latin for ""guilty mind""[1][2][3]) is the mental element of a person's intention to commit a crime; or knowledge that one's action or lack of action would cause a crime to be committed. It is a necessary element of many crimes.

Yes, certainly there’s a limit. If the UK was going to literally collapse and become a third world country then it obviously wouldn’t be worth it.

I don’t know exactly where I’d draw my own personal line - I can’t give you a precise number. The difficulty is that we’re all trying to predict the future with no real idea of what is going to happen. It is hard enough to predict 2 or 3 years into the future based on the current situation; it’s practically impossible when there are so many known unknowns. 

&gt; also on the point of soverignity, what would you say is a greater threat to our ability to govern our own laws, the European union, or pressure by large MNCs that exert pressure on our government to change laws to suit their own agenda?

I want our government to be able to pass a law which then governs our country. There are always lobbyists trying to influence those laws. I’d argue that the EU actually makes this far, far worse - as big MNCs can lobby Brussels and get one law passed which then affects all 28 member states. That’s much more “efficient” than lobbying 28 separate governments.

So they are now openly admitting it's not a matter of national security, but just a way to get leverage. Which means the tariffs break WTO rules. They probably broke the rules even if it really was about national security, but now that possible defense is gone.

I can't think of a much stupider idea. When other countries face tariffs they don't just throw their hands up and agree to whatever the US demands. They impose counter-tariffs, and will just say, 'well remove your tariffs and we'll remove ours'.  We know this, because China has already done it. Canada and the EU are also set to impose tariffs (and maybe already have?). And since the US is putting tariffs on every other country, the US doesn't have the option to turn to other countries to import goods and skirt the tariffs. China, Canada, Mexico, the EU, etc have dozens of countries they can turn to in order to skirt the US tariffs however.

Also, the entire mindset is just cruel. Trump is saying that it doesn't matter that other people in other countries are being hurt; all that matters is Americans. I know the racist members of his base might love that idea, but most people have empathy, and actually care if other people get hurt. I agree with the idea of trying to make more money.

Find a very stable relative, trusted friend or mail-forwarding service to use as your registered address. The address on your driver's license, registration and title shall match. Your credit/debit cards should also be at this address. To save a bit of trouble, if at all possible, register in a state that does not require annual inspections. Many RVer-centric mail-forwarding services are in Florida for this reason.  


The folks at your registered address can forward your annual registration which you update online to you via mail. This is a once-per-year headache.  


You will want to find an efficient, comfortable car, despite those factors tending to counteract one another, with service centers found in both rural and urban locations. If you have spent much time at travel centers over the last five years you will note the preponderance of Nissan Versas with distant plates. This should not be considered a recommendation. You should operate the car normally for at least half of its warranty period (in miles) so that you become familiar with its quirks before setting off.  


This car should be kept free of non-standard appearing parts, with the possible exception of a roof rack. No stickers, additional logos or fanciful graphics of any kind. Anything you intend to keep with you that isn't safety related shall be stowed obscured, ideally in the trunk. Get a distinct device to use as a sat-nav, and be certain you have a power bank to power your sat-nav, vehicle camera(s), phone, and any other daily use devices you may require which charge via USB and let the car keep the power bank charged. If you intend to have a laptop with you, an in-cabin desk might be warranted. Do not move the vehicle with the desk in use position or the laptop powered.

Have a fire extinguisher readily reached by the driver and invest in one of those larger first-aid kits. These are things better to have and not need than the other way around.

Carry spares of light bulbs/modules and the like. Do not set off without ""pre-flight"" on any journey more than 100 miles. You will want video cameras that can connect ""to the cloud"" for evidence. Document your journey on a daily basis in any form you fancy, but be certain to do so. In the however unlikely event you ""disappear"" a record of some kind may be required to commence a private or publicly sponsored investigation. Get a bottomless data-plan, even at 3G speed.

Have an explicit destination in mind. If an authority figure intervenes, they expect a quick, explicit answer to your ultimate destination and your purpose for heading there. (""I am on my way to Miami to visit my sister"") Not having this information can cost you weeks of your life and thousands of dollars. On the same token, never carry anything that might be considered contraband. This includes alcoholic beverages, firearms of any kind for any purpose, or persons who may appear to be under 27 years old who do not have identification documents with your last name on them. In rural areas of the south, midwest, southwest, mid-south, and eastern bits of the Pacific Northwest a car with people who appear to be of different races is an invitation to trouble. In the event this may come to be, stick religiously to the Interstates and be prepared to explain to authority the nature of your longstanding relationship with these people and why you are travelling together. In my experience, marriage is not a suitable excuse.

Work out which of the super-regional or national travel centers you like best and get their loyalty card. Pilot-Flying J has free wi-fi for loyalty card holders and those vacuum coffee machines that keep it fresh tasting. Establish a protocol for waste. Dispose of the waste in the car at least once per day or at every fuel stop. If you are over 40, fill the fuel tank when you get to half full. You'll be stopping about that time anyway. This is also a defense against contaminated fuel. Minimize or eliminate consumption of caffeine while traveling over the road.

And, in online discussions, it’s, unfortunately, far too common for someone to go “oh, well you believe this, so you’re an idiot”, to dismiss someone’s otherwise well articulated argument. 

People who think conservatives are idiots, or liberals are idiots, or libertarians are idiots, etc. Our *entire* 2-party, political system is basically run run this way. Why do you think there are “party line” voters? Because they reduce the intelligence of the opposing side based off of one argument they perceive is (or could actually be) wrong, then conclude the other side couldn’t possibly be right about anything else.

This is just one among *many* reasons this happens though. 

However, you’ll rarely see this opinion expressed as cleanly as shown in OP, though it still happens with surprising regularity. 

Instead, you’ll usually hear someone insult another person’s intelligence because of something else, then proceed to claim that person can’t have made a good point about something else. 

Example, and person me for picking on one side of this issue, i’m sure that you can find plenty of examples for the opposing side. 

A conservative makes a point about devising gun safety legislation that is actually effective, instead of blanket banning certain products based on metrics that people who don’t really understand guns have made up. 

A liberal comes in and says “oh, you’re a conservative, so you just want guns sold to everyone willy nilly!”

The implication is that “being a conservative” is “ben Carson the politician” (being an idiot) and therefore can’t have made a point about guns, an area where the person happens to be “Ben Carson the Neurosurgeon”.

A counter example (just in case) is when a liberal makes a point about how we can achieve universal health care, then cites basically all of europe and Canada, but a conservative chimes in “you’re just some communist/socialist liberal”.

Again, being a liberal = Ben Carson the politician = you couldn’t possibly have made a rational point. 

TL;DR: you will rarely ever see a cut and dry example like the above, where someone literally claims “well you were an idiot about this, therefore you have to be an idiot about everything else”. Usually, you’ll see people instead insult each other’s beliefs, implying they’re idiotic, then dismissing the argument, because an idiot can’t make any good points. Basically, wherever you see people resorting to ad hominem attacks, they’re employing this tactic.

Um pequeno texto sobre essa época fantástica que era o Estado Novo:

Denegação por anáfora merencória


&gt;""Eu nunca fui obrigado a fazer a saudação fascista aos «meus superiores». Eu nunca andei fardado com um uniforme verde e amarelo de S de Salazar à cintura. Eu nunca marchei, em ordem unida, aos sábados, com outros miúdos, no meio de cânticos e brados militares. Eu nunca vi os colegas mais velhos serem levados para a «mílícia», para fazerem manejo de arma com a Mauser. Eu nunca fui arregimentado, dias e dias, para gigantescos festivais de ginástica no Estádio do Jamor. Eu nunca assisti ao histerismo generalizado em torno do «Senhor Presidente do Conselho», nem ao servilismo sabujo para com o «venerando Chefe do Estado». Eu nunca fui sujeito ao culto do «Chefe», «chefe de turma», «chefe de quina», «chefe dos contínuos», «chefe da esquadra», «chefe do Estado». Eu nunca fui obrigado a ouvir discursos sobre «Deus, Pátria e Família». Eu nunca ouvi gritar: «quem manda? Salazar, Salazar, Salazar». Eu nunca tive manuais escolares que ironizassem com «os pretos» e com «as raças inferiores». Eu nunca me apercebi do «dia da Raça». Eu nunca ouvi louvar a acção dos «Viriatos» na Guerra de Espanha. Eu nunca fui obrigado a ler textos escolares que convidassem à resignação, à pobreza e ao conformismo; Eu nunca fui pressionado para me converter ao catolicismo e me «baptizar». Eu nunca fui em grupos levar géneros a pobres, politicamente seleccionados, porque era mesmo assim. Eu nunca assisti á miséria fétida dos hospitais dos indigentes. Eu nunca vi os meus pais inquietados e em susto. Eu nunca tive que esconder livros e papéis em casa de vizinhos ou amigos. Eu nunca assisti à apreensão dos livros do meu pai. Eu nunca soube de uma cadeia escura chamada o Aljube em que os presos eram sepultados vivos em «curros». Eu nunca convivi com alguém que tivesse penado no Tarrafal. Eu nunca soube de gente pobre espancada, vilipendiada e perseguida e nunca vi gente simples do campo a ser humilhada e insultada. Eu nunca vi o meu pai preso e nunca fui impedido de o visitar durante dias a fio enquanto ele estava «no sono». Eu nunca fui interpelado e ameaçado por guardas quando olhava, de fora, para as grades da cadeia. Eu nunca fui capturado no castelo de S. Jorge por um legionário, por estar a falar inglês sem ser «intréprete oficial». Eu nunca fui conduzido à força a uma cave, no mesmo castelo, em que havia fardas verdes e cães pastores alemães. Eu nunca vi homens e mulheres a sofrer na cadeia da vila por não quererem trabalhar de sol a sol. Eu nunca soube de alentejanos presos, às ranchadas, por se encontrarem a cantar na rua. Eu nunca assisti a umas eleições falsificadas, nunca vi uma manifestação espontânea ser reprimida por cavalaria à sabrada; eu nunca senti os tiros a chicotearem pelas paredes de Lisboa, em Alfama, durante o Primeiro de Maio. Eu nunca assisti a um comício interrompido, um colóquio desconvocado, uma sessão de cinema proibida. Eu nunca presenciei a invasão dum cineclube de jovens com roubo de ficheiros, gente ameaçada, cartazes arrancados. Eu nunca soube do assalto à Sociedade Portuguesa de Escritores, da prisão dos seus dirigentes. Eu nunca soube da lei do silêncio e da damnatio memoriae que impendia sobre os mais prestigiados intelectuais do meu país. Eu nunca fui confrontado quotidianamente com propaganda do estado corporativo e nunca tive de sofrer as campanhas de mentalização de locutores, escribas e comentadores da Rádio e da Televisão. Eu nunca me dei conta de que houvesse censura à imprensa e livros proibidos. Eu nunca ouvi dizer que tinha havido gente assassinada nas ruas, nos caminhos e nas cadeias. Eu nunca baixei a voz num café, para falar com o companheiro do lado. Eu nunca tive de me preocupar com aquele homem encostado ali à esquina. Eu nunca sofri nenhuma carga policial por reclamar «autonomia» universitária. Eu nunca vi amigos e colegas de cabeça aberta pelas coronhas policiais. Eu nunca fui levado pela polícia, num autocarro, para o Governo Civil de Lisboa por indicação de um reitor celerado. Eu nunca vi o meu pai ser julgado por um tribunal de três juízes carrascos por fazer parte do «organismo das cooperativas», do PCP, com alguns comerciantes da Baixa, contabilistas, vendedores e outros tenebrosos subversivos. Eu nunca fui sistematicamente seguido por brigadas que utilizavam um certo Volkswagen verde. Eu nunca tive o meu telefone vigiado. Eu nunca fui impedido de ler o que me apetecia, falar quando me ocorria, ver os filmes e as peças de teatro que queria. Eu nunca fui proibido de viajar para o estrangeiro. Eu nunca fui expressamente bloqueado em concursos de acesso à função pública. Eu nunca vi a minha vida devassada, nem a minha correspondência apreendida. Eu nunca fui precedido pela informação de que não «oferecia garantias de colaborar na realização dos fins superiores do Estado». Eu nunca fui objecto de comunicações «a bem da nação». Eu nunca fui preso. Eu nunca tive o serviço militar ilegalmente interrompido por uma polícia civil. Eu nunca fui julgado e condenado a dois anos de cadeia por actividades que seriam perfeitamente quotidianas e normais noutro país qualquer; Eu nunca estive onze dias e onze noites, alternados, impedidos de dormir, e a ser quotidianamente insultado e ameaçado. Eu nunca tive alucinações, nunca tombei de cansaço. Eu nunca conheci as prisões de Caxias e de Peniche. Eu nunca me dei conta, aí, de alguém que tivesse sido perseguido, espancado e privado do sono. Eu nunca estive destinado à Companhia Disciplinar de Penamacor. Eu nunca tive de fugir clandestinamente do país. Eu nunca vivi num regime de partido único. Eu nunca tive a infelicidade de conhecer o fascismo.""

On one hand the polymorph spell states:

&gt; The target’s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast.

Which should imply class features, as they are part of the target's game statistics.

This is confirmed by [this Tweet.](https://www.sageadvice.eu/2017/11/09/if-a-raging-barbarian-is-polymorphed-through-the-spell-polymorph-is-the-rage-still-ongoing-2/)

However, JCraw also ruled that [an Abjuration wizard keeps their Arcane Ward if polymorphed.](https://www.sageadvice.eu/2016/10/23/if-an-abjuration-wizard-with-arcane-ward-polymorphs-into-a-beast-does-he-retain-the-arcane-ward/) Which is also a class feature.

As the first tweet I quoted is from 2017, and the second is from 2016, I am inclined to rule that they can't smite.

Edit: The most recent [Rules Answered](http://media.wizards.com/2017/dnd/downloads/SA-Compendium.pdf) that I can find states:

&gt; Can you concentrate on a spell while transformed by polymorph? You can’t cast spells while you’re transformed by polymorph, but nothing in the spell prevents you from concentrating on a spell that you previously cast before being transformed.

~~As Smite is a form of spell casting (in that it uses a spell slot) I still would rule you can't Smite when polymorphed.~~

Edit:  I have spread a falsehood on the internet, I humbly apologize.

In the last chapter of his autobiography The World of Yesterday: Memories of a European (1942), Stefan Zweig lamented a lost world of freedom:

“Before 1914, the earth had belonged to all. People went where they wished and stayed as long as they pleased. There were no permits, no visas, and it always gives me pleasure to astonish the young by telling them that before 1914 I travelled to India and to America without passport and without ever having seen one. One embarked and alighted without questioning or being questioned… The frontiers which, with their customs officers, police and militia, have become wire barriers thanks to the pathological suspicion of everybody against everybody else, were nothing but symbolic lines which one crossed with as little thought as one crosses the Meridian of Greenwich… I, a case-hardened creature of an age of freedom and a citizen of the world-republic of my dreams, count every impression of a rubber stamp in my passport a stigma…”

Zweig’s lamentation evokes a sympathetic echo in many liberals today, when borders are springing back into view across the world. For Zweig, freedom meant the Hapsburg empire, where people could live securely without needing any particular national identity. This was the world in which he grew up, and without it he was homeless. When he became convinced that the liberal Europe represented by the Hapsburg empire had “committed suicide”, as he put it in letters to friends, it was too much to bear. On 22 February 1942, the day after he posted the manuscript of his memoirs to his New York publisher from Brazil, where his flight from Nazi Europe had ended, Zweig and his wife, Lotte, killed themselves.

Three quarters of a century later, Douglas Murray also thinks Europe is destroying itself. In the first sentence of his best-selling The Strange Death of Europe, published in 2017 and now reissued in an updated paperback edition, he declares: “Europe is committing suicide.” But whereas for Zweig it was nationalism that destroyed Europe, for Murray it is Europe’s loss of belief in itself. Murray – associate editor of the Spectator and founder of the right-leaning Centre for Social Cohesion think tank – criticises liberals for denying or diminishing the problems that come with sudden large increases in immigration, when the migrants come from other cultures. But the real problem, he is convinced, is an influx of Muslims.

Discussing the public response to the migrant crisis, he writes: “What very few people saw or mentioned was that the racial background of the incomers was an insignificant matter alongside the far greater issue of creed.” The most important fact about the crisis, Murray asserts repeatedly, is that it involves the encounter of Islam with a hollowed-out, guilt-ridden, faithless Europe. The consequence will be the Islamisation of the continent and the end of European civilisation. Citing the work of the French novelist Michel Houellebecq approvingly, he comments that when the protagonist of his novel Submission (2015) finally converts to Islam “he will be part of a community of meaning for the first time… the logic of Islam is practical, and, in a society ripe for submission, irrefutable”.

Murray’s evident admiration for Houellebecq is telling. Much of The Strange Death of Europe reads more like a sensational novel than an exercise in analysis. The book has the form of a narrative, comprising a succession of arresting vignettes – migrants burning down a camp in Lesbos, sexual assaults by immigrants on women and children in Germany, racism among migrant groups in Lampedusa, terrorist atrocities in France – and concluding with a dramatic denouement. The story is necessarily selective, and misses out a number of salient facts.

One of them is that the migrant crisis is global in its reach. It is not only Europe that shuts out Muslims. So do many Muslim countries. Saudi Arabia has built a 600-mile-long fence along its border with Iraq, and there are similar barriers between Turkey and Syria, and Iran and Pakistan. Beyond the Muslim world, Mexico deports larger numbers of migrants back to Central and Latin America than the Trump administration does. Elsewhere war and environmental collapse are powerful factors in population flows. Worldwide, large flows of people are a by-product of globalisation. Rapid movements of capital and production continuously destroy livelihoods, and uneven economic development gives workers an incentive to seek opportunities in richer countries where they may not be welcome. These are not clashes of civilisations, and where Islam is involved the conflicts are often intra-Islamic.

In Murray’s defence it might be argued that his narrative has to do with immigration in Europe, not throughout the world. Even so, it passes over key facts. The Schengen treaty is barely mentioned but it is this agreement that has made the migrant crisis intractable by removing internal borders from much of the continent. Empty chatter about a Europe-wide solution only highlights Europe’s incapacity to act.

Migrant numbers have fallen over the past year. But for the Visegrád Group – Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia –the optimum number is zero, while Austria and Italy are bent on deporting migrants that have already arrived. In Germany, the interior minister’s threat to close the country’s borders produced a compromise in which tighter controls will be instituted. Merkel’s coalition has survived for the time being, but it cannot be too long before the far-right AfD (Alternative for Germany) – whose mounting electoral threat triggered the political upheaval – enters government. Macron in France is holding out against the trend, but he is alone. In a paradox that Murray does not explore, the result of pursuing the stupendous liberal project of Europe-wide freedom of movement is the illiberal Europe we have today.

Writing in this magazine two years ago (“The age of hyper-terrorism”), I suggested that European institutions faced a trilemma they could not resolve: “Open borders, liberal democracy and highly developed welfare states are not simultaneously sustainable… A continent-wide process of Orbánisation is under way.” Pre-1914 Europe was able to be borderless because democracy was limited and the welfare state only beginning. Once they are enfranchised, popular majorities resist open borders because they fear the effects on welfare provision and wage levels and demand some say in the overall direction of society. When their protests are ignored by mainstream politicians, they turn to authoritarian leaders. The success of Viktor Orbán in Hungary, where he secured a “super-majority” in parliamentary elections in April, is only an incident in the march across Europe of what the Hungarian leader has described as illiberal democracy. The trilemma that has defeated European institutions is being resolved by events. Borders are being reinstated in a disorderly scramble. Liberal Europe is fading from memory.

As part of this process the European social democratic model is becoming extinct. Writing in the New York Review of Books in 2009, the historian Tony Judt – an impassioned social democrat – noted:

It is not by chance that social democracy and welfare states have worked best in small, homogeneous countries, where issues of trust and mutual suspicion do not arise so acutely. A willingness to pay for other people’s services and benefits rests on the understanding that they in turn will do likewise for you and your children: because they are like you and see the world as you do. Conversely, where immigration and visible minorities have altered the demography of a country, we typically find suspicion of others and a loss of enthusiasm for the institutions of the welfare state.

The force of Judt’s analysis will only be strengthened if, as could possibly happen, Sweden proves to be the next domino to fall to the far right.

There is nothing accidental in the demise of social democracy. It was always at odds with continent-wide labour mobility – a neoliberal project that presupposes the rollback of national welfare states and downward flexibility in wages. What is unexpected – at least for unthinking liberals – is that the far right has benefited most from social democracy’s demise. With the centre left shrunken and moribund, voters have flocked to fringe parties, many of which have links with interwar fascism.

Murray thinks there is little to fear from the rise of the far right. Indeed, except in a few fringe cases, he denies that anything of the sort is occurring. He admits that “truly fascist” parties have re-emerged – Golden Dawn in Greece and Jobbik in Hungary, for example – but takes a benign view of parties such as France’s Front National and Germany’s AfD. These “thoughtful and clearly non-fascist parties once described as ‘far right’” are simply instances of democracy in action. It is difficult to share his complacency. Marine Le Pen’s mask of moderation slipped when, in the closing stages of last year’s presidential election, she deployed her father’s hate-filled rhetoric in an attempt to rally her core supporters. The AfD may have begun as an association of Eurosceptic economists, but it has evolved into a party a sizeable number of whose members seem sympathetic to “revisionist” views of Germany’s 20th-century history, including the Nazi period.",True,False,False,,0,1533217642,,False,0,e3h14xr,True,t3_93ze95,False,t3_93ze95,/r/centerleftpolitics/comments/93ze95/how_deep_is_the_decline_of_the_west/e3h14xr/,,1536998012,4,True,False,centerleftpolitics,t5_3oilk,r/centerleftpolitics,public,

Iceland, which has the lowest violent crime rates in the world, has enough guns in country for 1 of every 3 Icelanders. The Czech Republic allows almost anyone to conceal carry a firearm in public, and they have some of the lowes

It is a matter of fact that having a gun increases the risk of suicide and murder and accidental deaths.

Regarding murders, the difference between say Switzerland and the US is that at least in Europe you have to do some background checks, guns are more regulated, whereas in the US it is actually legal to buy guns in private sales without any control, even if you are a criminal or mentally ill [edit: it is legal to sell to a criminal, but it is not legal for the criminal to buy]

That’s the big difference

He gave a foreign recruit's mother $6000 (not the mother of current player) and also involved in a booster paying someone $1000 a month to take care of a current player, which he misled investigators about. The recruit never signed with OSU because it turned out he had been playing pro in Europe earning money and was ineligible.

&gt; O’Brien was forced to disclose the payment to Radojevic because of a lawsuit by Kathleen Salyers.  The lawsuit centered on the improper benefits Boban Savovic received; however, the $6,000 payment to Radojevic was mentioned in the suit.  At this point O’Brien had no choice and had to come clean to Andy Geiger, the former Ohio State Athletic Director. 

&gt; On June 8th, 2004 Andy Geiger fired Jim O’Brien for violation of NCAA rules.  O’Brien file’s a lawsuit against Ohio State for wrongful termination and eventually wins a settlement of $2.2 million dollars plus interest in February of 2006.  Interesting enough, in the judgment the court ruled that O’Brien violated his contract; however, the violation was not serious enough to warrant his dismissal. 

&gt; Jim O’Brien claims he gave the money to Radojevic because the family just lost their father and the Radojevic’s mother was unable to provide for their 3 siblings. 

Whether that part was true or not he was still involved in paying someone to sponsor a foreign player (and apparently 2 others.) Which is why the NCAA also gave him a show cause, and forfeited your wins and final 4 run.

I also found his measured 7/10 position on the EU to be close to my own and the most reflective of the truth. Labour voters voted 60% for remain, and if you are blaming his campaign for the loss then you really are attributing him too much credit.

He brings the government to account regularly at Prime ministers questions and Labour does a lot to challenge the conservatives on a weekly basis. But again, the media doesn't report it with great pressure and I am not sure what else he can do. I see the efforts, but the public largely don't care or have be convinced not to listen if they are filtered through the mainstream.

Again mostly everything you say feeds back into the conservatives being in power and backed by those in the media. When surveyed the population is for many of his policies they just seem turned against the man. PR over good policy. His choice is to play the game and lose like Milliband or push past them to speak to voters directly. When he does that, 10 point bump and we can see that direct contact persists.

I have been listening to my rather large, mostly well educated and socially engaged Thai family members and friends and neighbors speaking on occasion about farang, or responding to my occasional complaints about time-consuming nasty visa related processes - always speaking only in Thai which I totally comprehend, for decades.  The essence is always:

1) they don’t like seeing scrubby tweaker looking folks walking around (ergo tourist police will
     Pay attention to these types more than well dressed visitors.   Thais like neat, tidy well dressed people.
     Hang out at any major Thai shopping venue or ride BTS and have a look.  How many slobbed-out
     Walmart type shoppers can you detect among Thai people, especially ladies.  They really care about
      their appearance.
2) they hate punters although they grudging accept that punters keep many of the prettier Esan types           
      employed
3). They hate old white pensioners living cheap and hanging around the beach.  This one is funny since
       The family owns a bunch of property in Hua Hin and rents cheap flats to many retired Swedes.   But
        they don’t like them except on rent due day.
4). They like wealthier well-behaved farang tourists (preferably couples or families) who come, look,
       enjoy, spend then get the Hell out.

These sentiments are not held by a few but by many thai I have listened to. Even (I think the majority) of bar girls prefer or keep a Thai husband/boyfriend).    For whatever reason not once have I heard any complaints regarding visitors from Japan or complaints about the nasty visa bureaucracy from a Japanese.  Every Japanese I know has a multi-entry B (business visa) which is a one year deal good for 90 days at a shot.

So many Americans and Europeans somehow get the idea that they are savored in Thailand.  The “Thai
Smile” can fool many.   Thais by nature are genial people and Buddhist practice teaches them from youth to be kind to all.  My point is don’t look to Thai citizens to demand an easier, more friendly visa system for long stay.   Seeing your face and wallet for a 30 day shot is more than enough for most of them

[How Germany Builds Twice As Many Cars As The U.S. While Paying Its Workers Twice As Much](https://www.forbes.com/sites/frederickallen/2011/12/21/germany-builds-twice-as-many-cars-as-the-u-s-while-paying-its-auto-workers-twice-as-much/#11d9df2a6b78)


&gt;**In 2010, Germany produced more than 5.5 million automobiles; the U.S produced 2.7 million**. At the same time, the **average auto worker in Germany made $67.14 per hour in salary in benefits; the average one in the U.S. made $33.77 per hour**. Yet Germany's big three car companies—BMW, Daimler DDAIY +0% ( Mercedes-Benz ), and Volkswagen—are very profitable.

&gt;How can that be? The question is explored in a new article from Remapping Debate, a public policy e-journal. Its author, Kevin C. Brown, writes that ""the salient difference is that, **in Germany, the automakers operate within an environment that precludes a race to the bottom; in the U.S., they operate within an environment that encourages such a race**.""

&gt;There are ""two overlapping sets of institutions"" in Germany that guarantee high wages and good working conditions for autoworkers. The first is IG Metall, **the country's equivalent of the United Automobile Workers**. Virtually all Germany's car workers are members, and though they have the right to strike, they ""hardly use it, because there is an elaborate system of conflict resolution that regularly is used to come to some sort of compromise that is acceptable to all parties,"" according to Horst Mund, an IG Metall executive. The second institution is the German constitution, which allows for ""works councils"" in every factory, where management and employees work together on matters like shop floor conditions and work life. Mund says this guarantees cooperation, ""where you don't always wear your management pin or your union pin.""


&gt;Mund points out that this goes against all mainstream wisdom of the neo-liberals. We have strong unions, we have strong social security systems, we have high wages. So, if I believed what the neo-liberals are arguing, we would have to be bankrupt, but apparently this is not the case. Despite high wages . . . despite our possibility to influence companies, the economy is working well in Germany.


&gt;As Michael Maibach, president and chief executive of the European American Business Council, puts it, **union-management relations in the U.S. are ""adversarial,"" whereas in Germany they're ""collaborative**.""

&gt;Does such a happy relationship survive when German automakers set up shop in the U.S.? No. As a historian observes in the article,  ""BMW is a German company and it has a very German hierarchy and management system in Germany,"" yet ""when they are operating in Spartanburg [in South Carolina] they have become very, very easily adaptable to Spartanburg business culture."" At Volkswagen's Chattanooga plant, the nonunionized new employees get $14.50 an hour, which rises to $19.50 after three years.

&gt;**The article's author, Kevin C. Brown, asked Claude Barfield, a scholar with the American Enterprise Institute, why the German car companies behave so differently in the U.S. He answered, ""Because they can get away with it so far.""**



[Want a raise? Join a union](https://money.cnn.com/2015/02/24/news/economy/union-wages/index.html)

&gt;**The typical union worker made $970 a week in 2014, compared to $763 for non-union workers, according to the latest Bureau of Labor Statistics data.**


&gt;That 27% spread has remained relatively constant at least since 2000, when the agency started tracking the data.

&gt;To be sure, not everyone wants to be stuck in a union contract, which dictates many work rules in addition to pay. Some prefer to bargain individually for their wage and annual raises.

&gt;Still, union workers continue to command a substantial wage premium in their fields, said Lance Compa, senior lecturer at Cornell's ILR School, which focuses on labor relations. Unionized registered nurses make an average of $75,000 a year, while their non-union peers make $60,000, for instance.



Your anecdotal experience will help to convince people to be against unions, and that will depress wages for many others.



I got a bad taco once. But not all tacos are bad.




But we have enough people like you in the US to make sure wages and union membership stay low.



To use your bad experience to say that unions are bad is very short-sighted considering the fact that the more unions we have, the better everyone gets paid.




But lots of people seem to be okay with everyone getting less so long as ""that guy"" doesn't  get more.




Kind of like people who are willing to pay [more for healthcare in the US](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/03/26/21-graphs-that-show-americas-health-care-prices-are-ludicrous/?utm_term=.784cc3996bb7), so long as they don't have to pay for some ""lazy freeloader.""

&gt;
&gt;I'd like to point out that you have done the exact same thing, using almost the exact same wording in your first comment.


No mate I was quoting you saying there was a million reasons for brexit.....is this how we are starting off....bodes great for what I'm about to read 


&gt;The EU may have conceded to the UK more than any other country because a) the UK has a large economic and political influence across the world (more so than any other EU member state and is considered a World Power therefore making sense for the EU to be flexible),  b) nationhood means a lot more to the UK than many others in Europe and studies show that UK MEPs are more rebellious when it comes to issues surrounding EU rulings over national parliaments. **The EU overruled the UK parliament 55 times and consistently finds itself out of step.**

The reason it did is irrelevant to this discussion. 

Now let me correct the fallacy of the UK parliament overruled 55 times


https://fullfact.org/europe/how-often-does-eu-overrule-british-ministers/

The UK votes no and vetos more things than any other country in the eu, so obviously it'll be outvoted in the council more because of that. 

It also completely disregards all the shit that goes on even before the vote where the UK is fully apart of and in alot of those 55 cases actually helped draft only for political government at the time to decide for publicity at home to vote against it.

The UK is fucking renowned for helping to craft directives and then voting against them when they know it will pass anyway so they can play politics at home 



&gt;[Here is an interesting read on the primacy of EU law over national parliaments.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primacy_of_European_Union_law)

-The Court of Justice does not, however, have any power to strike down national law; this is a task for the national courts. The national courts will, however, seek to resolve the conflict through interpretation. But UK courts are required not to enforce UK laws to the extent that they are incompatible with EU obligations.


And again you don't realise the UK parliament can literally overturn that tomorrow if they want. They helped create it and signed up to it and then the what the UK always did in the UK complain about it.

One of the previous links in the other comment already covered this fallacy, which goes to show how little you actually read of the sourced material



&gt;So when you say ""this is bullshit"" ... well, it really isn't. The EU in it's current form is supreme over national governments and I believe this is an inherent flaw in a supposedly democratic system.

No again that is bullshit as already pointed out in about 5 different sourced links in the last comment. Please read the material before replying. It's courteous and means I don't have to waste my time answering questions stemming from the same underlying ignornance 


&gt;Yes they were. The UK, as I said before, is a [net contributor](https://fullfact.org/europe/our-eu-membership-fee-55-million/) of £8.6 billion to the EU. Once the UK has left the EU, that money has disappeared... so where is it going to come from? Higher taxes in Germany? France? Spain? Or will Greece be used as the sacrificial lamb again, leading to the inevitable Greek departure from the EU (potentially followed by others). This is a genuine danger and you would have to be some kind of arrogant fool not to realise it. [Even Juncker himself has acknowledged that the EU is facing an existential threat after Brexit](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/13/jean-claude-juncker-eu-is-facing-existential-crisis)
&gt;So yes, Brexit does affect those things.

You fucked up this quote anyway it's no relation to what I said was not affected by brexit. Either way the other comment already has the sourced link that shows trade with the eu will cost **1.5 percent MORE** on a no deal WTO and **.5 percent MORE** with a soft deal. Meaning you will contribute MORE to the eu in brexit. And that's just in trade that doesn't include what you have to pay to have access to r&amp;d, regulation, programs like Erasmus etc etc that the government said they will be staying in 


So there will be NO REDUCTION in the money you send to the eu IT WILL INCREASE

Once again I can only ask to please read the sources already provided rather than ignorning them and then spewing out the same ignornat bullshit over and over. It's a waste of my time to have to repeat myself 

&gt;Your other point
&gt;
&gt;&gt; The UK had full control of all non EU immigration
&gt;
&gt;The fact that a nation doesn't have full control over **all** of it's own immigration is shocking in itself. By 2015, EU immigration was as high as non-EU immigration for the first time ever, both peaking at just under 200,000. Since the vote, EU immigration has dropped while non-EU has continued to rise... but I still don't see how people can be against having full control of their country's borders as opposed to just *sort-of half control.*


No it's not shocking it's a deal made to make the European Union work. If your shocked by that your a retard 


&gt;[Here's a full-fact on immigration if you want that too](https://fullfact.org/immigration/eu-migration-and-uk/)


Yea it says exactly what I said. Best part is the UK **has to increase eu migration** to keep it's economy going so as the government already admitted eu immigration will increase even after brexit 




&gt;I would also struggle to believe anything reported about Brexit in the Independent. 

You struggle to believe basic facts mate so nothing surprised me, copy and paste the headline it was in all papers regardless of bias


&gt;On trade though, there are currently 24 countries using WTO rules that are trading with Britain. The EU has agreed a number of better deals around those rules for the benefit of it's member states (I've never denied that). **However** now that the UK is leaving the EU, there will no longer have to be a waiting period of negotiations with every other member state. The UK will be able to trade with it's own interests front and centre (again I bring up the Wallonia fiasco that you so willfully ignored.) That is the theory behind it.





&gt;Also your 'source' comes from (and I quote directly from the Indy) ""pro-EU campaigners"" and ""Senior Remain-backing MPs"" that made some comments during a debate. Now you and I both know that is hardly an unbiased source.

https://www.ft.com/content/06c6ffc0-0cf9-11e8-8eb7-42f857ea9f09

Fine read your own government impact statement that said the same thing. Not that you will you haven't read any of the source material so far as you keep saying the same bullshit 



&gt;
&gt;The EU does not have a standing army. That's literally a lie. What they do have is the CDSP which is not the same thing. 
&gt;[This however, is deeply concerning.](http://uk.businessinsider.com/eu-countries-agree-mega-army-2017-11)


Great you aren't forced into it. If the rest of the EU wants an eu army so we aren't reliant on Trump's America who the fuck are you to say they can't? You aren't forced into like you claimed and this point you made is irrelevant to the initial discussion


&gt;The creation of a standing EU military will undermine NATO and is hardly going to ease tensions between the US and EU. Most of the EU countries in NATO don't even pay their fair share into NATO and are essentially scrounging defence from the UK, US and France.

Jesus Christ you reading from trumps Twitter now. You just demonstrated again your complete ignornance on another topic. There is no paying your fair share into NATO. What your confusing is the commitment of countries to spend a certain amount ON THIER OWN DEFENSE of course the UK us and France have bigger self defense budgets.....that's blatantly obvious. Either way it's again redundant as they've already agreed and already started getting everyone to pay more. 


&gt;
&gt;[Here is a nice remain supporting piece about how ""there will never be an EU army"" and how it was all a Brexiteer ""fantasy"" from 2016... whoops!](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/27/is-there-a-secret-plan-to-create-an-eu-army)


There will never be an eu army that the UK is forced into. They are correct 




&gt;
&gt;I've covered net contribution twice now too so I don't feel I need to reiterate you other points again.

No you didn't because what you said was bullshit and proven so 5 different ways now

&gt;And on the prospect of no-deal, it is undesirable. However, if the EU believes that the deal offered by the UK is unfit then so be it. It is better to take the 1.5% from a no-deal than to be made the EU's whipping boy and tied to the mast as a warning to other member states. There is absolutely no way the EU would say something along the lines of ""ohh it's ok, we forgive you!"" And frankly we wouldn't want them to. I just wish the UK's leadership had the balls to negotiate properly instead of proposing ridiculous deals they know will be declined.


Way to prove again your complete ignorance on economic realities. The links in the previous post already answered that I'm not repeating 


&gt;In any case, I suggest you take your hands, wrap them around your head and pull it as hard as you can to try and dislodge it from your arse. You've clearly had it up there far too long.


Great good finish.


Now let's try this again.

**Name one thing that will be factually better after brexit**

I love how you completely lost focus of that underlying point to just babble more opinion that was already disproven. 


Look mate I'm not going to waste my time with someone that is so ignorant that when presented with the factual evidence what they said is wrong they just put their hands on their ears and repeat the same thing over and over again ..

Children could legally be euthanized if they were in “great pain” — a subjective notion to stake someone’s life on — and if there was no available treatment. They do not need to be terminally ill. Sickeningly, the bill was pushed by Belgian politicians because children were already being illegally euthanized.

False,Prufrock451,1302188147.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_52l9x,"The D-Day landings bring hundreds of thousands of Allied soldiers to northern France. Among them is a force of 5,000 Ethiopian Imperial Guardsmen, tasked with guarding Allied supply lines after the initial invasion force moves inland. The Ethiopians serve as part of the British command, under Field Marshal Montgomery, who despite four years of combat partnership still refuses to put the Ethiopians on the front line. 

The failure of his plan in Operation Market Garden forces his hand. The Allied supply situation is critical, and the Germans refuse to let go of the vital Belgian port of Antwerp. Montgomery is stretched thin, his forces stripped by his failed attempt to encircle the Low Countries. In October 1944, Montgomery sends the Imperial Guard into action, alongside several Canadian divisions. 

The Ethiopians charge forward through flooded fields, braving the cold and withering enemy fire, to clear German pockets south of the Scheldt River. It is brutal work, house to house, against a numerically superior foe, and it continues for five weeks. At the end, the Canadian army is exhausted; of the 60,000 Allied troops, 6,000 are dead and another 6,000 wounded. (The Germans have lost a similar number of casualties and 40,000 German troops surrender.) The Ethiopians, often used callously and out of their element in the cold and damp, are more severely mauled; nearly 800 are dead and 2,000 wounded or sick. The remainder are so worn out that they are basically out of combat until the crisis of the Bulge forces them back into action. 

The Battle of the Scheldt is the only major engagement of the Ethiopian Army in World War II, but it makes heroes of thousands. The brave and skillful performance of the Imperial Guard makes headlines, and forces the United States Armed Forces to make its first cautious efforts towards desegregation. 

When the war ends in 1945, nearly 200,000 Ethiopians have served overseas. The country's GDP has more than doubled, and a modern infrastructure is in place. Ethiopian produce, bought on generous terms, continues to travel to Europe, now to feed refugees under the Marshall Plan instead of foreign armies. Ethiopia's Imperial Guard goes overseas again to fight under the UN flag in Korea, where it again distinguishes itself. 

Ethiopia gains a UN Trusteeship over Eritrea; Selassie is extremely aware of the potential for problems, and he cannot risk playing the colonizer while trying to extract his nation from entanglement in the British import-export system. He solves this by playing the model benefactor, building up Eritrea as Britain built up Ethiopia. Selassie becomes an avid proponent of free trade, in order to prevent borders from ever growing between the two nations, and to give a business-friendly face to the upheavals which he knows must accompany decolonization. Decolonization is coming, even more swiftly than in our world, because here an African nation stood up as an equal partner of the world's greatest powers, and it fought in the defeat of first the Italians and then the Germans. 

When Haile Selassie dies in 1975, Africa is far from free of problems. Ethiopia is not a paradise. His example does not inspire the end of racism in America, or the birth of new religions to rival Rastafarianism, although his visit to the United Nations and then to Harlem appears to herald a new era of worship. What he leaves behind, however, is not an unstable nation on the verge of brutal dictatorship, of mismanagement which will kill millions in famine and war, of secession and misery. He leaves behind a federal monarchy where the majority (of men, at least) are literate, where English is the language of science and business, where British and American money settled in 1945 and grew into a large banking industry. 

The laissez-faire philosophy required by Ethiopia's export-driven economy, reliance on foreign ports, and if we're being honest the still-developing ability of the Ethiopian state to manage the many ethnic groups on its rugged terrain, position the country well to serve as a financial center during the era of decolonization. Ethiopia prospers, and its developing service sector blunts the impact of export price shocks. Ethiopia's outreach to other developing nations includes the provision of skilled workers and financial services to the Arab states after the postwar discovery of vast oil reserves; early Ethiopian investment pays off, and the management of Arab oil wealth is the fuel of Ethiopia's modern economy. Ecotourism, unfortunately, is on life support due to the ongoing border crisis with the failed state of Somalia. The only nation which recognizes the Ethiopian puppet state of North Somaliland is faithful Eritrea, which depends on Ethiopian import/export fees for much of its economy.

Today, Ethiopia's population is around 90 million, and the rapidly dropping birth rate means it appears the population will stabilize around 100 million. It has a GDP of about $300 billion, on par with Egypt or Pakistan, although agricultural price fluctuations still mean this number swings greatly. It is closely allied with the United States, and hosts hundreds of U.S. soldiers from Africa Command. Emperor Zera Yacob has been on the throne since 1993, although that means very little these days as a growing insurgency forced him to cede nearly all of his powers to the elected Parliament. Ethiopia is at a crossroads. Its economy is not sustainable, as increased prosperity and thus domestic consumption has eaten up the exports it used to rely on. Ethiopia's service sector is still thriving but challenged by Arab states trying to pull their money back from African banks, and by the rise of other banking centers in Kenya, Nigeria, and Angola. Ethiopia's reputation is not as spotless as it was; many Africans are disillusioned by Ethiopian involvement in Somalia, especially the occupation of Somaliland. More were disappointed by the bald greed which drove Ethiopian involvement in the wars in Congo over the last two decades. Will the promise of Ethiopia's future remain bright?

A spectre is haunting Europe — the spectre of communism. All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre: Pope and Tsar, Metternich and Guizot, French Radicals and German police-spies.
Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as communistic by its opponents in power? Where is the opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach of communism, against the more advanced opposition parties, as well as against its reactionary adversaries?
Two things result from this fact:
I. Communism is already acknowledged by all European powers to be itself a power.
II. It is high time that Communists should openly, in the face of the whole world, publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the Spectre of Communism with a manifesto of the party itself.
To this end, Communists of various nationalities have assembled in London and sketched the following manifesto, to be published in the English, French, German, Italian, Flemish and Danish languages.
Chapter I. Bourgeois and Proletarians(1)

[German Original]
The history of all hitherto existing society(2) is the history of class struggles.
Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master(3) and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.
In the earlier epochs of history, we find almost everywhere a complicated arrangement of society into various orders, a manifold gradation of social rank. In ancient Rome we have patricians, knights, plebeians, slaves; in the Middle Ages, feudal lords, vassals, guild-masters, journeymen, apprentices, serfs; in almost all of these classes, again, subordinate gradations.
The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones.
Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinct feature: it has simplified class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other — Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.",True,False,False,,0,1533225226,,False,0,e3ha17o,False,t3_93xzus,True,t3_93xzus,/comments/93xzus/cat_heart_finger_ring_necklace_earrings_for_women/e3ha17o/,,1537002166,0,True,False,u_Artmartinfo,t5_mnpvj,u/Artmartinfo,user,

First off, as I just stated it's not a meme. Look at the video, and you'll see fights with 6-10k+ healing per second and more cleanses than FB. It's a niche, that you don't need 10 players on, but it's certainly a very strong build which outperforms FB in some areas. But yes, it's not fully accepted everywhere. Feel free to link them builds, videos or arguments to change their minds.

&gt; most organized groups probably won’t want to run with you. But they can’t kick you from the map, so fuck em and go zap it up. 

However, this is why you're a toxic rando asshat. It does not matter what organised groups want, need or ask for. If you want to run with them, you should respect them. If you don't, why do you even insist on following them? You're the kind of player that forces them to be extra toxic because truthfully, you have ZERO respect for the players you're literally playing with. You're just griefing them because you consider your own opinion more valid and important and won't even consider their wishes. 

And the result of that? Less commanders particularly for players like you. EU has lost virtually all its casual-oriented pugmanders on many servers. These comms can't lead the style they used to - laid back but trying, and were condemmed to full clownfiesta; until they gave up and quit. And public commanders in general are going down pretty quickly. Toxicity is going up, and the chances of you jumping into WvW and finding a group that'll let you play whatever you want is smaller than ever.

And it's because of your toxic attidue. You make it clear that you will stalk groups to do whatever you want no matter what they wish. No matter how nice they ask, howmany times they try, how they attempt to please you. It's irrelevant, only your opinion is. And you further promote this to others? Yet somehow I bet you believe you think you're the nice guy and they're elitist. 

You're the reason I kick every special snowflake in the game. Honestly, nobody wants to deal with this entitled hot garbage. 

The good attitude is to attempt to make (niche) builds which are viable, convince players to let you test them and improve through that. Like OP is doing; ask how they can be most useful within what they consider acceptable; and find a group that can live with that. 

Your attitude? Your attitude is what results in half the pugmanders quitting the game or becoming more elitist. You literally force them to; because of YOUR toxic unrespectful bullshit. 

You should focus on improving your understanding and gameplay and not your special rights and needs.

- Attack on Titan (2013) is a dark action series about fighting man eating giants. The anime has incredible animation and an awesome soundtrack I also think it has one of the best first two episodes in anime. One of the most popular anime out there. Lots of mystery and cliffhangers.

[Attack on Titan OP 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvpZHdC80lE)





- JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012) Generational action shonen that involves multiple characters throughout time. Adapted from an older manga that is still going after decades. Has a very unique sense of style with a really creative battle system that makes it standout from many action shonen. Would give it until episode 12 to know if its for you.

[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 1 OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_vux8N4dy4)

- One Punch Man (2015) This anime has some amazing animation done for it. One Punch Man I think has one of the best fight scenes in anime. It also kind of parodies the battle shonen (basically the tropes present in superhero movies and anime like DBZ).

[One Punch Man OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atxYe-nOa9w)

- Mob Psycho (2016) Similar to OPM in that it is an action comedy (same author) the fight scenes aren’t as great as in OPM (though still awesome) though I felt the characters and humor overall was better.

[Mob Psycho 100] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTvKNoru41Q)

- Death Note (2006) Supernatural crime/detective drama about a book that allows you to kill anyone in the world if you know their face and name. Main character plans to use it to create a utopia vs other main character and detectives who try to stop him. A story of psychological battles and tricks to gain an upper hand. A very well regarded anime.

[Death Note OP 1]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QE9cmfxx4s)

- Eureka 7 (2005) Definitely has a road trip vibe along with skaters fighting evil government with surfing robots. Does cover some heavy like religious persecution. Action/adventure with romance. 

[Eureka 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOE4Qfans9M)


- FMAB (Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood) (2009)A boy makes a Faustian bargain and has to revert the consequences by going on an adventure to find a mystical stone of alchemy the philosopher stone. Deals with imperialism, militarism, redemption, forgiveness, the value of human life and science vs faith and the pros and cons that both have when taken to extreme and not regulated. I would recommend the dub for this one I usually will say watch in subtitles but I like the dub for this anime better. 

[FMAB OP 1]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PusR3agGeio)




- Legend of the Galactic Heroes (OVA 1988-1997) Like Star Wars in a way but with more focus on space battles and politics pitting a corrupt democracy against a virtuous authoritarian state rather than a light vs dark battle with space magic. Some incredible characters and interesting conflicts regarding war, governance and human nature.  Overall a great epic space opera. My personal favorite anime of all time by a large margin. Remake for it is out not a bad adaptation space battles and some of the effects are more dynamic some of the archs were a little rushed (not heavily it could have used two more episodes basically). It also covers the first book only so far plus next year covering the second. The original has covered all 10. Watch the movies My Conquest is A Sea of Stars and Overture of War before starting the main show. (two geniuses battling it out with different ideologies)

[OP 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E2RvobUsHQ)
[ED 1]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFUndm3rTco)


- A Silent Voice (2016 movie release) Deals with redemption group think, bullying and suicide. Film has some awesome shots and a unbelievable soundtrack. One of my favorite redemption stories ever. I would also read the manga after finishing it though as the movie does exclude some side character development. It’s more of a low key romance and does have some comedy but the focus is on the inner turmoil and drama. (still awaiting a legal release of the film in NA manga is available though in NA.)

[Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfK6UgLra7g)


- Psycho Pass (2012) A cyberpunk detective story and one of the better villains I have seen in anime has some interesting views on society and creating a utopia with some good action as well. I would say it’s like Minority Report if you have seen that movie. 

[Psycho Pass OP 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWBDuVCuiUQ)


- Yona of the Dawn (2014) action/adventure with an Asian low fantasy setting. Lots of character development occurs regarding the main character throughout the series one of my favorite Female MC’s (her journey from spoiled princess to dashing rogue is wonderful). You might have to switch to the manga when you are done with the anime unfortunately. Manga is fairly successful but it’s been awhile since the last season. Author is a fan of LOTOR and it kind of has the epic adventure aspect of that.

[Yona of the Dawn OP 1]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfgNlVdDnxs)

- Haikyuu! (2014) If you want to see a sports anime that definitely keeps you hyped and engaged. Overall has a fairly good and wide range cast that receives some development. Even if you aren't a sports fan I think it’s a great watch. 

[Haikyuu! OP 1]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2---3Iysnqg)



 - 3-Gatsu no Lion (2016) Is also worth a shot it deals with a pro shogi player (Shogi is like chess though there are a few differences) dealing with depression and overcoming it. This one is another favorite but it’s a slower anime so just be open to the fact. It also has some wonderful side characters and can be quite funny at times. The shogi scenes are also really good even if you don’t know the rules since the focus is on the psychological battle between the two characters and Shaft really did a lot of great work on the imagery.

[3-Gatsu No Lion OP 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAUXh5BmjY)

- Code Geass (2006) Is another really popular anime deals with the moral complexities of revolution and rebellion. It takes place in an alternate history and it’s also a pretty good intro to the mecha genre. Some great character development and moral dilemmas that the characters face. (mecha shows that involve big giant robots think Transformers but people pilot them)

[Code Geass OP 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ7zQbMxm28)

- Cowboy Bebop (1998) An action space series animation holds up amazing well today also had one of the best endings in anime. Episodic mostly with a few overarching plot lines. One of the more well regarded anime out there and one of my favorites. There is some pretty good humor as well. It’s basically a space Western if you have seen Firefly it’s somewhat of like that. Also recommend the dub for this one.

[Cowboy Bebop OP]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI_8PUXx2A)

- Ghost in the Shell (Movie 1995) (SAC 2002) It’s a cyberpunk action/mystery story with a focus around what human consciousness is. SAC is more focused as a crime action drama. Both are highly praised.

[Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex 2nd GIG 2004 OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQIqgxeNtl0)


- Violet Evergarden (2018) Beautiful animation from Kyoto Animation. Mostly a slice of life series in a post war world (somewhat like post war Europe after world war 1). Focuses on an emotionally stunted child soldier who is learning more about human emotions and how to convey them in words. Mostly a slice of life series though there are more action segments towards the end.

[Violet Evergarden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lJIIBd5tXI)

- Barakamon(2014) A Pro calligrapher named Handa is exiled to an isolated bunch of islands away from Tokyo to reflect on his actions after attacking a well respected calligrapher after critiquing his work. Story is mostly a comedy/slice of life with various antics with the locals and Handa but can also be fairly introspective and heartwarming.

[Barakamon OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vvL3z3pAs0)



- Cells At Work (airing) Osmosis Jones the anime action comedy about the human body looks fairly fun and my most anticipated new non sequel show for the the summer season. Actually fairly educational with quite a bit of info that was packed into the first two episodes.

[Cells At Work Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-p6_-gNSrI)

A few upcoming shows to keep track of  (you can read the manga right now):



- Vinland Saga(manga only now but anime in production likely late 2019 early 2020) Takes place in the early 11th century towards the end of the Viking Age. A story that can be summed up in one world STRUGGLE. Not just the violence but living day to day in unstable world. Deals with the realities of war, slavery and political chaos that defined Europe after the Fall of the Western Roman Empire. If the anime can adapt it right it definitely will be up there something to keep an eye on. (studio doing it same as AOT)

[Vinland Saga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rwiua0hXOVo)


- The Promised Neverland (anime Winter 2019) Anime about children escaping an orphanage after discovering a horrifying secret. Battles of wits and of late has been my favorite Jump title (up to chapter 34 end of volume 4 of the manga). Has been dubbed the new Death Note battle of wits dark jump title etc.

Just curious, how do you define the words ""concentration camp"" and ""internment camp""?

I'm still not clear as to your point, it still sounds like you're trying to say ""I don't like the way we handle people crossing our boarder, so therefor eugenics can't work""... which again, sounds like a fallacy.

&gt;I genuinely don't understand why you don't seem to grasp how the Nazi's forced sterilizations and subsequent genocide is wholly relevant to the discussion.

I didn't say that it wasn't relevant, on the contrary, I think it has a place in the discussion. What I don't think is relevant is the constant accusations that all eugenics is somehow bad because the Nazi's also did it. If you want to talk about concerns about how eugenics could turn into genocide, that would be an acceptable point to make, but so far it seems like you've been trying to make the claim that ""the Nazi's did x, therefor x is bad"" which is not a valid argument.

&gt;I'm not saying ""The Nazis did it, therefore it's bad,"" I'm saying the Nazis followed your logic that thinning the gene pool would benefit society.

Oh, okay that's an acceptable claim. I do agree, I think thinning the gene pool would benefit society. However, I would like you to acknowledge that I have not been in favor of thinning the gene pool based on religious, ethnic, or orientation measures. Rather my measure would allow anyone from any group to be able to prosper. I also repeat the I believe that it is a god-given right to have a biological child. I do not think such a belief would fit with the Nazi's. What do you think?

&gt;Everything they did was justified up by the ""science"" of eugenics. 

I'm no so sure I agree with this claim. Again, I don't think that the average Nazi had any idea what an IQ bell curve was... and even today I don't think the majority really understands the concept. The Nazi's were fueling their eugenics program on ethnic and racial means, more-so than scientific means. In fact, the Jewish IQ is actually **higher** than the average white European IQ. This is actually something frequently noted when discussing the wage gap in America. The only two groups with higher IQ's than whites are Jewish and East Asians, and ""coincidentally"" those are the two groups which have higher average earnings than whites in America (I consider Jewish people to be white, personally, though i am aware that not all identify as white).

&gt;And, instead, it ultimately led to the extermination of over 17 million people. 

Okay, but can you please at least acknowledge that I have not promoted exterminating anyone?

&gt;Those are just facts. You might think your theory is more nuanced, but I don't see how.

I would like to rectify this, because I still think that you don't really have any clue as to what kinds of policies I am supporting. I don't really feel like you're willing to listen to my stance on the topic, I feel more like you're just trying to argue with me.

&gt;Even if the program starts off with good intentions, what's to stop it from spiraling out of control when xenophobia inevitably rears its ugly head?

I think a lot of xenophobia comes from the fact that people are concerned about other groups destroying whatever culture/system they had built up. If people could be confident that the future generations will be more intelligent than their own generation, it will make it far more difficult to justify the fears of xenophobia. How can the next generation be bad if they (as an aggregated group) are smarter than your generation (as an aggregated group)?

&gt;Do we exclude or include the mentally ill from your proposal?

Well first off, everyone is included. We would test all parents.

If a person is violent or in need of institutional help, they should be limited to one biological child. Otherwise, I see no reason to limit people... we all get stuff like anxiety from time to time, no need to limit people over petty issues.

&gt;Do we exclude people with diagnosable learning deficiencies?

Again, everyone is included, the question is whether or not they would be allowed more than one biological child. We would not limit people as long as they could pass a certain score on an IQ test, and as long as they do not need to be institutionalized/imprisoned with a felony and aren't violent.

&gt;Or are they on the chopping block too? They are obviously unfit for your utopian society, so what do we do with them?

""chopping block"", what do you mean by ""chopping block""? I've been quite clear to you that this is about preventing certain births, not executing anyone. Also the words ""utopian society"" are yours not mine. I don't go around calling every policy that I agree with ""a pathway towards utopia!"", because that would be hyperbolic nonsense. Obviously all societies will have crime and bad actors. This doesn't prevent that. What this does is provide a counter balance to the knowledge that we have found that lower IQ people have higher birthrates than higher IQ people.",True,False,False,,0,1533230081,,False,0,e3hg79b,False,t3_93moh2,True,t1_e3hcmrx,/r/pics/comments/93moh2/vietnam_war_lighter/e3hg79b/,,1537005050,1,True,False,pics,t5_2qh0u,r/pics,public,

False,backward_z,1268936212.0,,pint2,[],,,dark,text,t2_3y42r,"Craft beer is American style, post commodity adjunct lager.

It has to do with a mentality of innovation and experimentation.

See, Europe never had prohibition, so all the small, local/regional breweries that produce their local styles were never interrupted and therefore still exist very similarly to how they always have. Traditional European beer is not craft.

Here in the states, we had prohibition which fucked everything up. After it was repealed, a few large magnates bought up all of the beer market space (Adolphus Busch, et al) and began producing pilsner style lagers which came to completely dominate the market space where the source of competition didn't come from innovative styles or flavors, but rather cutting of production costs by introducing adjunct sugars, corn, rice, etc. So in the 1980's, American homebrewing took off as Americans visiting Europe kept asking the question, ""Why isn't our beer this good?""

So American homebrewers from the 80's started opening breweries, Sierra Nevada, Elysian, Buffalo Bill's, so on which kicked off the ""micro brewery"" trend. Fast forward a decade or two, suddenly those ""micro"" breweries aren't so ""micro"" anymore, so we substituted the word ""craft.""

To that end, ""craft"" meant a brewery that wasn't one of the big boys with the implicit understanding that craft breweries are producing more a third wave style of product--artisan quality with focus on flavor and the experience of drinking, not on the costs of production. I still think this is at the heart of ""craft.""

Again, European beer is doing what it has done for generations--that's not craft. Certain European (and elsewhere) brewers are emulating the American craft style (e.g. Mikkeller, To Ol, Cloudwater) and those I would consider ""craft."" Somebody like Weihenstephaner or Chimay, while they make very high quality, artisan products, not so much, as they're not really innovating or pushing their limits.

Nowadays with the large corporate takeovers of smaller breweries, the definition of ""craft"" has become very murky, with several actors (Brewers Association) trying to claim specific definitions for it--I think this is kind of a circle jerk.

What it comes down to, and I'll appropriate a Henry Rollins quote here. Rollins said that a band that makes the records that they want to make while making a bunch of money hasn't sold out. A band has sold out when they make the record their producer tells them to make. I think of craft beer similarly.  A brewery is craft when the brewer decides what to brew and the marketing department figures out how to sell it. A brewery is no longer craft when the marketing department tells the brewer what to brew.",True,False,False,,0,1533230146,,False,0,e3hga8l,False,t3_93ptg0,True,t1_e3gseam,/r/beer/comments/93ptg0/no_stupid_questions_wednesday_ask_anything_about/e3hga8l/,,1537005086,4,True,False,beer,t5_2qhg1,r/beer,public,

What is true however that the rare occasions where you get highly innovative individuals this happens more frequently among europeans than among other groups, just like the best Sumo Ringers tend to be Mongolian. Mongols are not generically better than anyone because of that. In this sense Europeans should not get preferential treatment by the state and they have no inherent higher ethical worth.


That being said, innovation is a useful quality (for everyone because white and non white people alike benefited massively from it the last 200 years), so I think dwindling population numbers of white people are somewhat disconcerting - if they become rarer, world innovation likely takes a hit, because the highly innovative individuals get proportionally rarer too, which likely would hurt the average life quality. I think we should try to  incentivise higher birth rates in western europe because of this, since those populations are shrinkng, but current policy is to make up for these dwindling numbers for importing foreigners.

False,[deleted],,,,,,,dark,,,"Grunden er jo at man ønsker fødevaresikkerhed. Fødevarer er det vigtigste for et samfund overhovedet.

Problemet er bare at den måde det er konstrueret på lige nu nærmest opfordrer landmændene til at være nogen tudeprinser der rækker hånden frem og forventer hjælp hver eneste gang der kommer et udsving i vejret.

Det er ikke fordi landmændende ikke ved at den slags kan ske. Men af en eller anden grund er det nærmest hvert eneste år at landmændende tuder over et eller andet!

""Vi må ikke sprede så meget gylle som vi vil!""

""Vi må ikke sprøjte alt det vi vil!""

""Det regner for meget!""

""Det er alt for tørt!""

""Forbrugerne driller!""

""Hvorfor skal jeg betale for at jeg har forurenet den lokale grundvandsboring!""

""Hvorfor falder priserne nu efter mig og alle mine kollegaer har fået lov til at tage millardlån til at udvide vores bedrift?""

""Vores korn er for ringe selvom både bryggerier og møllebranchen er uenige""


Samtidig kan man se landmænd køre rundt i Range Rovers til en halv million, indkøbe store nye traktorer til flere millioner. Bo i kæmpestore huse med nyt køkken, fladskærm på hvert værelse osv. osv.

Og nej, det handler ikke om at jeg er misundelig...

Så er jeg godt klar over at der er mange landmænd der skylder så mange penge væk at de aldrig nogensinde kan betale det tilbage, men så er vi netop tilbage til problemet! De her store lån bliver kun givet fordi bankerne ved at landmændende får millioner i støtte fra EU, og at politikerne nok skal ændre lovgivningen så landmændende får hvad de vil have, eller kaste penge efter dem i tilfælde af tørke/skybrud osv.

Vi overproducerer i forvejen så ekstremt meget at der er bjerge af mad der bare bliver destrueret hver eneste dag. Ikke kun efter produktionen, men også efter forarbejdning.

Min holdning er, at selvfølgelig skal vi have fødevaresikkerhed herhjemme, og selvfølgelig skal landmænd kunne klare sig. Men nu har vi efterhånden kørt med det her i rigtig lang tid uden at det nogensinde har fungeret ordenligt, og samtidig smadrer landbruget vores miljø på rigtig mange forskellige måder. Hvis ikke det er overdrevent brug af kvælstof der skaber iltsvind i fjorde, eller fiskedød i bække og åer, så er det forgiftning af grundvandet, oppumpning af vand fra bække og åer i tørre perioder hvilket smadrer den økologiske tilstand i bækken i de næste mange år.

Samtidig bliver over 80% af alt jord i hele landet brugt på landbrugt. Hovedparten bliver brugt på at gro majs til foder til grise. Så det er ikke engang fordi det bliver brugt på at dyrke grøntsager eller korn. Desuden eksporteres langt det meste til udlandet, hvis ikke det destrueres.

Problemet er at landmændende betales for hvor meget de kan producere, ikke udfra hvor stor efterspørgsel der er.

Jeg ved ikke hvad løsningen er. Men hvis vi brugte nogen penge på at støtte landmænd der formår at dyrke på en bæredygtig måde, uden at smadre miljøet, og uden et konstant incitament for at producere mere, bare for at producere mere, så tror jeg vi ville nå rigtig langt.",False,False,False,,0,1533236172,,1533237040,0,e3hnwae,False,t3_941n6x,False,t1_e3hmhts,/r/Denmark/comments/941n6x/dansk_landbrug_er_der_noget_om_snakken_eller_om/e3hnwae/,,1537008642,20,True,False,Denmark,t5_2qjto,r/Denmark,public,

Or was it a treaty between the same countries that had been together (minus germany, plus russia) as the Allies? Hmm, this is tough. Oh wait, it isnt. Its MAD. The world wars happened despite similiar treaties at work. In fact, those treaties are what turned them into world wars. But good job, keep trying to siphon the credit for the peace you have tried your hardest to destroy. 

In reality, NATO, while a useful organization with all kinds of perks, has done nothing to prevent a world war. It has also done nothing to keep the world safe or at peace, if anything it has hindered both in large parts of the world.

Keep trying to go ""oh, the US isnt worse than russia"". Im sure that will stop terrorism born from hatred of the country that destroyed their countries, killed their families and friends and ruined their future. Im sure if you tell them ""Oh we made the world safe and peaceful"", they will forget about those millions of civilians youve killed over the years.

Or, the western world continues to work with the US because A, our economies are too linked to quickly cut ties, B, allyships are notoriously hard to undo, especially without consequences and C, we know what the US does if its displeased, and they are afraid of it?

Yes, the greatest threat for germany and the UK is russia. In what bloody world do you live where that is a thing that can happen? Russia will never be at all a problem for the western parts of europe. We have nukes. MAD applies. Hell, recall that until Ukraine was invaded, there was no reason for anyone to fear russia, as they had been doing a fat load of nothing on the world stage. 

The only threats we could face from either are internally, in which case, well the US has committed various crimes against humanity all throughout europe, had major surveillance operations on numerous countries, and has been known to have meddled in several of our democratic procceedings. Russia has done some of those too (primarly the crimes against humanity parts, they had several assassinations after all), but once again, as far as what is the bigger threat to us, well, the US has done more to hurt us directly, but then there is also the terror crisis and the refugee crisis, which we both have to thank the US for. 

So please, get a reality check. Look in the mirror.

After discussing with a friend who had done it, I went to see a doctor who immediately said I should undergo breast reduction. In Belgium, it’s partially covered by healthcare if deemed “necessary” for medical reasons so I ended up paying around $1000, including a short hospital stay.

Procedure wasn’t painful except when they removed the blood drains after the operation. I wore heavy bandages during two weeks and felt a bit sore for a few days. I don’t remember when the scars completely healed but after a year or two, they were mostly unnoticeable unless I was lying on my back. I heard there is even less scarring now because the procedure is less invasive then 20 years ago.

I never regretted it. I went from a E/F to a decent C. They still look ok at 40 even after breastfeeding (it’s not always possible to breastfeed after a breast reduction but my surgeon had told me he had been “careful”). Maybe not as perky as they were after the operation but I can’t complain!

Basically, you have two tiers of care in these nations. One for the wealthy that matches US quality, and one for everyone else that does not.

And as far as it works: it works by force of the gun and the wealthy immensely enjoy these systems. You're staggeringly less likely to go from middle class to wealthy (top 20% by income) in nations that have socialized medicine.

Cheap isn't better, especially when it comes to you not dying. This myth that the US just needs to socializes and the quality of care will stay the same is absurdly wrong.

The reason we have to subsidize care so much is primarily due to the salaries doctors make and the amount of cutting edge drugs and treatments we deliver, then it's 20% administrative costs, which medicare accounts for over half by itself for compliance. Not because insurance companies are cackling about their profits (until 2012 insurance companies were operating at a 7% margin, your grocery store is north of 12% on average).

84% of hospitals are nonprofit in the US.

Only 4% of hospitals that are for profit have any public shareholders, and only six of them exist outside counties where the average income is north of $100k.

So I'm not sure where this nonsense comes from. Simply put, American care is expensive because we don't allow by law providing NHS/CA quality healthcare to the working class at a cheaper rate the way McDonald's gives you a shitty burger for $2 whereas a prime steakhouse nets you $20 for that same burger. We do for medicaid, which is cheaper and more effective than any socialized nation in its quality of care and results with factors held constant. 

So there's your socialism, why not medicAID for all? yeah, no one wants cheap healthcare in the US it turns out.

The crying constantly about how 'other nations are so much cheaper!' Yeah, they also have shittier homes, shittier jobs, much lower incomes, terrible wait times and death rates on the surgery table, miserable cancer survival rates compared to the US (especially stage 4), and are on average significantly poorer than the average middle class american over their lifetime.

Simply put, only working class Americans can dream of having independent retirement due to things like an IRA for a damn reason. Everyone relies on pensions (both private and gov) that are constantly cut and are eaten by inflation.

Depends on what you want your end goal to be, and what you are willing to do to negotiate to that end goal.

Sure. Just like we are correct in doing what is in our best interest.

The person negotiating from a position of power.

For example, the US sells about 115 billion into China a year, and china sells a little over 500 billion to the US.

The US is hands down the biggest customer they have. That is the power position in the negotiation. And the customer is always right.

Apply that out to the EU:

By accordance with the law, you are not a citizen of that country and therefore do not have the right to call yourself a national of that country. And that's perfectly reasonable. Immigration is a decision, and therefore does not necessarily bear with it the right to remain in the country forever if suddenly there is a decision to change the rules. If Spain decided that it wasn't taking any immigration outside of the EU, then that would be its decision, and you would be expelled. If your country did something to provoke that response, you would be screwed, right? While in the EU, you are actually kind of protected from that, but you're in the EU with decisions being made from your own country. And you are not a spanish national and therefore may be excluded from duties that it provides. And that's reasonable, because who should be provided for first? People who live here from birth and whose parents worked for their rights here, or people who aren't registered spanish nationals who are permitted to stay here and enjoy living here? 

You want representation, therefore, and because you're an immigrant, and not a spanish national, you want representation back home because that's what decides ultimately whether you have a right to remain.

I would argue that Spain is justified in not offering you voting rights. You are not of this country. If the country itself doesn't want immigration, then allowing immigrants to vote to loosen the laws on immigration actually acts against the people of that country. Spain ultimately must put Spanish nationals first. If you decided that you wanted to change nationality and lose your right to be represented in other countries and become Spanish, that's another matter.

Pigmentation *is* an inherent part of human biology, and because of it's physical prominence, it's often what race is constructed around, especially in North America. However, it's still a false box to ship people in. (However, this is not to be confused with ethnicity, which does have biological precedent) Like, sometimes Jews are considered white, sometimes not, the same as Roma, and south Indians, Sri Lankans, and Austrailian Aborigenese are often considered black, even though they're more distantly related to Africans than Europeans are. At one point even, I, a Gael, would be considered black! (It's very weird. And it was *sincerely* believed that they were 100% black but with pale skin) ContraPoints did a very good video on it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PY3lBKje46E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PY3lBKje46E)

Ok, to deconstruct the rest. The thing is, there's plenty of grey area. It frankly irks me terribly when people say the likes of Star Wars or Tolkien's Legendarium are childish, 'black and white', because they really aren't. Sure, they have the pure good and pure bad, and you could argue that that is even reductionist, but there's plenty in between. Frodo and Sam are nearly seduced by the ring. Gollum could have been redeemed. Boromir and Denethor both succumb to madness, and they come out at different ends afterwards (The former is redeemed, the latter not). Dwarves, Ents, and Elves all don't get along, even though they're nominally on the same side (A dynamic I wish was more played out in LOTR) There's *plenty* of moral nuance there. And this nuance could be applied to how the evil men could be redeemable and have redeemable qualities- if the Dundelings can be redeemed somewhat, then why not the non-white people?

Also, you are simply blatently incorrect in your assumption that the dark ages- especially around Alfred the Great- were not steeped in political intriuge.

False,TrekkieGod,1360799869.0,,CmdEnsign,[],,Ensign,dark,text,t2_alahn,"&gt;While I understand that Earth is under threat from Changelings and, by extension, the Dominion, it does not excuse what occurs next. President Jaresh-Inyo declares Martial Law (reasonable, given the circumstances)...but instead of a local defense force protecting the planet, Starfleet Security begins beaming into major cities all over the planet. Is there no local force capable of dealing with this threat?

I think this is a case of using a crisis to expand authority, which we see all the time (and is incredibly dangerous). If the Federation were truly about to be invaded by the Changelings, Starfleet would make sense. I would expect the US military to be out in the streets if we were being invaded by a foreign power, not local police to protect us. In fact, I would find it troubling if local security forces were supplied with the resources necessary to handle an invasion: the police shouldn't have laser-guided missiles.

The problem is that they weren't being invaded, and a section of Starfleet was using a false-flag operation to take over the government. Which is absolutely a huge red-flag for the stability of the government. Also, the violation of civil liberties beforehand was very troubling. Blood tests of high-ranking Starfleet officers is one thing. Their families are another thing entirely. I equate it to the Patriot Act, in how fear starts causing governments to infringe on people's rights, and a large segment of the population to actually support it. It's unfortunately a common occurrence.

&gt;Take Richard Bashir, the father of Dr. Julian Bashir. He pleads guilty to illegal genetic engineering. He pleads guilty to the Judge Advocate General of Starfleet. Why is he not tried in civilian court? Do they not exist within the Federation?

Because he went to Starfleet to work out a plea deal in an attempt to save his son's career. I think normally he would be tried in a civilian court, and Julian would be go through a Court Martial (lying on his Starfleet application), but Richard specifically contacted the JAG to take full responsibility. So, I'm sure they were in touch with the civilian system as well, but it's understandable why they were involved.

&gt;Now let's turn our attention to Tom Paris, convicted of Treason against the Federation because he was captured during a mission with the Maquis. He is sent to a penal settlement in New Zealand administered by...""Starfleet Rehab"". At this point he is no longer a Starfleet officer, so why is he sent to a Starfleet-administered facility?

I'll grant you this one. I think it's understandable if you serve your sentence after a court-martial and you're only dismissed after. However, in Paris's case, he had already been dismissed for another offense, before being found among the Maquis. So this is very troubling.

&gt;You also have to consider how other races and even individucal people react to the Federation. It is worth noting that the Federation is an expansionist power, similar in many regards to the Klingons and even the Cardassians in that way. Where the Klingons and Cardassians use hard power (military conquest) the Federation uses soft power (diplomacy) to get their way.

It's not evil to be an expansionist power. The problem is precisely the means. If races voluntarily and peacefully join the Federation, that's a testament to what they have to offer their members. The EU is not evil because countries can apply to join.

&gt;Michael Eddington summed it up best when he referred to the Federation as ""worse than the Borg"" in the episode ""For the Cause""

Michael Eddington and T'Kuvma are both arrogant narcissists. They're going after what they want, and everything they say is an after-the-fact justification:

T'Kuvma just wants to be the one to bring the Empire back together, and be the leader. His rants are on the same level as bigoted racists chanting ""they shall not replace us."" Oh no, another culture is having an influence on your culture, however will we deal? Cultures change, and they're meant to be shared. Adopting parts of others' cultures into our own enriches us, it does not diminish us. This is the concept the Federation is based upon, but closed societies like the Klingons see change itself as a threat. Their society is based around the concept that Klingons and their society are superior, and a successful melting-pot culture like the Federation is a reminder that it might not be the case: the Federation's very existence is seen as a threat when they can be pointed to by members of Klingon society advocating for change: 'the Federation is strong, without subjugating the other races in their Empire.'""

Eddington is much the same way. He doesn't care about the Maquis, he's not after making the lives of the settlers better. He wants to be a hero, he wants to be seen as the hero. When Sisko threatens to make Maquis planets uninhabitable, Eddington doesn't turn himself in because he cares about those people. He turns himself in because it's his chance to be a martyr. He does it for himself, to be seen as the noble hero.

His speech is a justification. The Federation is obsessed with the Maquis because they're Federation citizens. When they commit terrorist acts against the Cardassians, the Federation is the point of contact. Eddington might claim they've renounced their citizenship, but he wants to have his cake and eat it too: they're a bunch of poorly armed settlers, and if the Federation actually chose to accept that they're leaving the Federation, the Cardassians wouldn't have to sneak weapons around to their own colonists: they would be able to take their military on a full-out assault and completely end the Maquis problem in weeks. What stops them from doing so is a treaty with the Federation to allow Federation colonists to remain in what is now Cardassian territory. And if they just started orbital bombardment, the Federation would consider it a treaty violation, an attack on their citizens, and would retaliate. Eddington wants the Federation to keep protecting them, but at the same time to look away when they commit terrorist acts, which is exactly what the Maquis colonists accuse the Cardassians of doing when they arm their colonists in the region. He's a hypocrite.

The *extremely* troubling part about this event, and something I've written about in another post recently, is that Sisko and every member of the Defiant didn't get a court martial and weren't immediately jailed for using weapons of mass destruction to get *one* man. There is no justification to this, and it's simply extremely poor writing that it didn't become a huge diplomatic deal for the rest of the show's run. Federation allies everywhere should be isolating them after that.

EDIT: Another point about Maquis hypocrisy is where they get their supplies. Keep in mind that for all their talk about being independent from the Federation, their military supplies are exclusively supplied by stealing from Starfleet. Often using people on the inside, like Eddington himself, who didn't resign from Starfleet, didn't renounce his Federation citizenship, and instead used his position to provide illegal support to a terrorist organization right up until he was found out.

You can look at US Russian relations through many different lenses and they all make some sense (psychological, pragmatic, economic, ideological, etc).  The lens I prefer and I think makes the most sense is Energy politics.   For a variety of reasons the price of oil collapsed in 2014.  This put an enormous strain on Russia (and coincidentally Venezuela).  Their government is heavily funded on oil (oil production is still nationalized in Russia).  This initiated a flight or fight response from Russia.  Russia became much more aggressive in geo-politics at this point (they had and will always meddle... everyone does including the USA it's just a matter of degree).     This stress on their government funding gave Russia a serious need to increase exports to the European market.  Many of their actions abroad particularly in Syria and their support of Iran have been aimed at blocking alternative pipelines.             

Admittedly here a lot of the fine points start to devolve in less agreed upon ideas and implicate the US in some really nasty business as we have a strong desire to not see Russia be the primary supplier of natural gas to the region.

Interestingly enough, modern Europeans are the mix of three groups, western hunter gatherers, early european farmers and ancient north eurasians that were as distinct from each other as modern Europeans are from East Asians today: 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic\_history\_of\_Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_history_of_Europe)

In fact, western hunter gathers had black skin and blue eyes. Ironically,  it is Northern Europeans that have the highest percentage of hunter gatherer genes today. 

[https://www.ancient-origins.net/human-origins-science/dark-skin-and-blue-eyes-european-hunter-gatherers-did-not-fit-common-021813](https://www.ancient-origins.net/human-origins-science/dark-skin-and-blue-eyes-european-hunter-gatherers-did-not-fit-common-021813)

Early european farmers were brown-skinned also. It was only the last wave, which came as recent as 3000 years ago, that was already white-skinned when they arrived. 

Of course, skin color is one the fastest things to change depending on the environmental conditions in evolutionary timescales. Take a bunch of Africans and move them to Sweden and in ten thousand years, they will get white die off due to lack of Vitamin D. Take a bunch of Swedes and move them to Africa and a in ten thousands here they will get pitch black or die off due to skin cancer. 

Another fun fact. One can argue that Native Americans are more closely related to modern Europeans than East Asians. While the majority of native DNA is shared with East Asians, a good one third is shared with western Eurasians. Moreover, East Asians and the ancestors of Native Americans diverged genetically around 35000-25000 years ago while the introduction of north Eurasian DNA into Europe is much more recent with the third wave of ancient north eurasians.

Meanwhile, the Eastern Orthodox world didn't typically undergo such progressive leaps in development, things remained essentially static for centuries and it was really only with the fall of the Romanov Dynasty in Russia and the expulsion of the Ottomans from the Balkans that Eastern Europe fnally began opening and ""catching up"" to the rest of the West.

thats cool, I just didn't know where you were starting from.

&gt;I’m just trying to better understand the aversion to challenging/changing our current situation through a new, outside organization/party.

And I still don't really know. I think the ""Go ahead - THROW YOUR VOTE AWAY!"" argument is very real. But do you mean change the party itself?

&gt;(1) if you don’t like the two parties you should just be an Independent, vote Independent, etc., and (2) the only way to change the system/parties is from within the system/parties.

Sounds realistic, I think.

&gt;It’s Pavlovian

I disagree. It's utilitarian.

&gt; Where did the perceived invincibility of these two organizations come from and when?

basically the Civil War, when Republicans became a party from the ashes of the Whigs. I really meant that. It was when it happened.

&gt; Frankly, I’d expect Americans to be far more pissed off, but the only fire I see is on the wings, where they mostly only want to shit on the other guy and/or burn everything down.

So you come from a parliamentary system?

My limited knowledge of parliamentary systems is you get pretty much the same left vs. right - just broken into more groups.

&gt;Please help me get my head around this.

Love to.

&gt;There’s no Constitutional basis for parties. 

The constitutional basis is for consensus, not parties. It just so happens there are 2 parties, and that the ""Consensus line"" for most things is over the 50% mark, more like a 60% mark. So when you are in a society that is politically 50/50 split, the politicians must give and take to produce legislation.

The system was even designed to stagnate intentionally, feeling that the basic english law judicial system we are based on was pretty good and didn't need much tweaking... and that the government should have a tough time and require a large consensus while governing.

&gt;So it seems “the system” we have is one that was “designed” not only by the two parties, but for the two parties

Not really.

A lot of it really is popularity vs. unpopularity too. It's why I brought up pop culture. Lincoln was super famous. His noterity as a Whig who converted to Republican took the media and the nation by storm and many followed suit.

3rd partys rarely could do anything without a similar ""Famous name"" at the top. The Bull Moose party is the first to pop in my mind, Because he was super popular.

Likewise - the other side tends to super-hate the super-popular.

And then ultimately you have the most famous politicians willingly go into the big existing parties looking for that infrastructure and support.

It's kind of like wondering why we don't have a second NBA - because there are so many people who want to be NBA stars that don't make it. Competition is stiff, there is no law that outlaws another NBA... and we do slowly see them rise in college and even post college and EU leagues and whatnot.

&gt;Again, how does than not piss people off?

I'd say everyone is constantly pissed off that they don't get their way in politics. I also believe that is a universal human trait, not an American one.

&gt;Not to mention that THAT system, and THOSE two parties ultimately got us to where we are now.

I keep being told how horrible we have it here in the US, but the reality is we don't. Not by a longshot. In Mexico over 100 politicians were assassinated by Cartels. Over 100! ""Free Speech"" in the UK hasn't looked free to me since at least 9/11, and maybe it's always been like that I don't know.

Our quality of life is so good it's crazy.

&gt;Finally, would you then say that Ross Perot’s failure was essentially where people gave up on the idea of a third party?

No, just the last time it crested.

I'd say Trump may have been able to do it as a third party, but was smart enough to just take over the GOP and eliminate a possible competitor from that party all at once.

I think a 3rd party simply requires a big name that can draw from both sides of the isle.

Trump did that, hate him as people do. Many Obama voters voted Trump. And wouldn't have voted republican for anyone else.

94million eligible voters in the US didn't vote. 65million voted Hillary and 63 million voted Trump.

""Political Scholars"" will tell you that those 94 million are a waste of time. That the few million that flip back and forth are the only ones to target...

I don't think that is an accurate view.

I think many of those 94 million voted at one time, became disillusioned, and then gave up. Most probably live in a state where their vote goes the other way traditionally, so they don't want to vote.

But they are there. Either party gets 10% of that vote, and they win every election in a land slide. A 3rd party that can take some of the 130 million that do vote, and 2/3s of the 94 million that don't also will win in a landslide.

Yea but we used to have diets back before the epidemic we would consider bad nutrition these days. People used molten butter as salad dressing, steamed chicken breast was for the sick.

I do see it as a paradox. If less education and information about nutrition and richer foods produce leaner people... wtf is going on

&gt; I don't mean the grinder, I mean all the unnecessary food being thrown away.

Ooh i get you.

I sometimes think that's a convenient middle class lie btw. It's the same people who are upset about food being thrown away that also demand a rich variation of fresh veggies and fish and bio meat at arm's length of where they reside. God forbid buying frozen or even canned food, that's poison! In essence they are just outsourcing the throwing away part and responsibility for the fast and refrigerated delivery chain.

&gt; I agree with you, especially since as I said, I'm trained by my parents that wasting food is bad.

Yea me too. I always thought that was something historically related to shortages in war and hence a European thing. I will ask for a second American opinion when I get the chance.

&gt; Well yeah, but nobody is willing to admit that a lot of this feminist critique is just an excuse for meangirling.

I agree. But ""meangirling"" sounds like a character flaw. To be honest, I think in grown women it is. Is it really though? Is there ""meanboying"" as a counterpiece? I see the foundation in this in the inability of feminism to see intrasexual competition among females, while so joyfully dissecting it amongst males. Men compete with men and women compete with women and make up their own hierarchies. It is not a flawed system, it is almost mathematical certainty that you are not at the top of the hierarchy, but indeed have to negotiate very human emotions like not feeling adequate, feeling jealous of other people or the partners they scored, condescending remarks received or made ... and reacting to them by means of emotions or choices.

Be a feminist and have the balls to point that out!? You either go the Sarkeesian way and say ""what's good for you is not necessarily good to end patriarchy!"" and end up with the contradiction of feminism telling women they can't do what they want. Or you point it out bluntly and get accused of whatever zoo of insults they have for you (Lets see... Victim blaming, heteronormativity, rape(theory)-apologism, whataboutism, biologism, evolutionary-sex-determinism, alt right pandering, dogwhistling, gaslighting, makingupinsultism)

An approximation of how dumb you sound is like confusing Benelux to mean all of Western Europe. That's literally how clueless you are of North America.

Do you really not see the inherent contradiction in saying ""US companies focus on quantity over quality"" and ""smaller breweries suck""? Companies that aren't Anheuser-Busch and Coors exist because tons of people focus on quality over quantity.

You didn't find the right things because you were on the wrong side of the continent, and it sounds like you suck at traveling or haven't traveled here at all. The United States isn't a cultural monolith; it's an agglomeration of cultures mixing unevenly. You know so little about North America that my answers are going over your head.

You can generalize by region, but you have to get your regions right. You don't go to Spain and judge the quality of all European vodka by what they make there. You don't go to the Ukraine, try their whisky, then judge all European whisky on that. And you for sure don't do it in generic hipster bars that are casting a wide net at the expense of quality.

Also, you're truly a fool if you think everything has been discovered in regards to food, especially in a craft as intricate and complex as brewing. Such small-mindedness is never a valid opinion.

As a western convert practicing in a Tibetan lineage, with more familiarity with the Tibetan traditions than anything else...  


""True"" means different things in different systems; for the kinds of Buddhism I've been around, which includes the place where the OP's picture was taken, it's less about ""truth"" in a factual sense and more about whether the teachings can bring about realization. In other words--do they work? Buddhism--and any particular lineage within it--doesn't have a monopoly on useful teachings. But if you're attracted to it and think it might work, then you have to learn about it and see it in action, ideally by visiting real in-person communities (assuming you're in the US/Canada/Western Europe, most cities have some convert-oriented centers), but especially by seeing the practices in action inside you.  


The same applies to any other spiritual practice system, by the way. It's really valuable to explore widely and not try to rush it, but it's also valuable to eventually come to settle into someplace for a long time. Time-tested, legitimate spiritual lineages bring with them a bundle of practices that work well together. Working with a mutually-compatible bundle, under the guidance of legitimate teachers and mentors, means you can actually go deep into something; people who dabble at the surface of a lot of different things have greater difficulty going deep.  I really like the way \[Lama Lena\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb2NDSpqdKQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb2NDSpqdKQ)), a Westerner trained by a prominent Tibetan Buddhist leader in India, talks about this.

Whose parents are from Iran or Indonesia or whatever, even if they are born and raised Berliners, they will get asked about their origins in a way that ""white"" Germans just don't. It's just an observation and I just think it's odd/ironic because in many ways, those of us who are visibly different just want to be seen as where we were born and raised.

I found this to be a facinating long-form story and an excellent example of an ""insightful article"" for /r/TrueReddit. 

*The men who train sheep for combat belong to a lost generation of Algerians, now in their 20s and 30s, moulded by an era of fear, fighting, corruption and curfews. There are few jobs and no productive roles for them to play in society. They lack relevant skills and education. Most are unmarried. They are not poor by most standards, but they depend on state subsidies that allow them to buy fuel, food and housing for next to nothing. They feel disposable, purposeless, humiliated. Most feel the future lies elsewhere. For many, that means Europe.*

*Today, the promises of postwar Algeria lie unfulfilled. Daily life has become an endless sequence of demeaning interactions with a bloated and oppressive bureaucracy.* **An outdated, socialist-inspired system rewards loyalty and promotes mediocrity while obstructing innovation and individual talent.**

Limitations of opportunities via political systems combined with outdated ""cultural opinions"" equals a breeding ground for these types of activities or worse. 

Algeria is in desperate need of several hundred packs of Border Collies to herd these sheep back into the fold.

&gt;Ownership is wealth; a legal right to profit from property.

Under a capitalist system, ownership is not wealth. You can own something worthless, or even something that accumulates debt. 

&gt;What if every individual citizen was a true capitalist (owner)? Corporations would then in some sense be owned by society.

I don't see how this follows. If everyone owned capital, that does not mean that everyone would be a factory owner and no one would be a factory worker. This is silly. You can't have an army of generals.

&gt;This is what the Cold War was all about. USSR was government ownership, central control of production. USA elevated private property and individual ownership.

Not even close. The World Wars era was a time when empires tried to take over the world, assisted by modern military technology. The United States was already island hopping the pacific and taking over central and south american countries before WWI. Germany tried twice (unsuccessfully) to conquer all of Europe, and the newly industrialized Soviet Union, being the biggest actor in WWII, accumulated massive power and influence. Since the US has abandoned the USSR did the same. The Cold War was about two superpowers trying to collapse the other and become the hegemony of the world. To say that it was about capitalism vs communism COMPLETELY misses the point.

I am definitely looking forward to watching the ""100 Years of Olympic Films"".

Now, I'm not going to say that the ""100 Years of Olympic Films"" will be one of the rare box sets and will be come a ""Holy Grail"" item in the collection, but unlike the Kurosawa set, where superior Blu-rays were restored, remastered and release afterward, I can't say the demand is as high for the Kurosawa set as they once were.

""100 Years of Olympic Films"", part of the reason of purchasing, aside from watching it and having it in my collection is that I don't want to complain of ""How I wish I purchased it"" when it was available especially at the discount price.  I also don't think there is a chance we are going to see another release like this.  Nor do I see  a tremendous number of people purchasing this set either.

On March 9, 1933, House Joint Resolution No. 192-10 by the 73rd Congress, was voted into law, which is the Emergency Banking Act.  This Act declared the Treasury of the United States, ‘Bankrupt’, which is an impossible feat since the U. S. Treasury was secretly closed by the Congress twelve years earlier in 1921.  The Emergency Banking Act succeeded in abrogating America’s gold standard and hypothecated all property found within the United States to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank.

All Sovereign American Citizens residing within the Republic of States suddenly and falsely were expatriated from their Sovereign American status without their knowledge or consent and their labor, souls, children, property, sweat equity and credit became the financial collateral for the public debt, which had then been converted into a Public Trust, which had been scripted after the ancient Roman Trusts.

“Script” money or [negotiable debt instruments] was issued by a private corporation, which is owned by a group of Sabbatean European Jewish Bankers and which is known to everybody as: “The Federal Reserve System.” These promissory notes were called Federal Reserve Notes and our future treatment by the U.S. Government was to be redefined under USC Title 50, ‘The Trading with the Enemy Act’ in which American citizens are defined as, “an enemy of their government” and this is the reason why Lincoln’s Declaration of War is renewed yearly by Congress and the President!  In the same year President Roosevelt closed THE VIRGINIA COLONY CORPORATION and opened a new Government Corporation called: THE UNITED STATES, INC.

“The Federal Reserve Act” was designed and written by a German National who was repatriated into the United States in 1903 through Ellis Island of New York.  His name was Paul Warburg, and who was a carbon copy of Alexander [Levine] Hamilton.  Mr. Warburg was a Sabbatean German Jewish Banker and CFO of the Rothschild Banking Empire.  Mr. Warburg’s assignment was to craft a piece of legislation designed to control the finances of the United States Corporation from Europe.  The Federal Reserve Act is approximately 1500 pages and places the currency and finance for the United States Corporation under a private corporation called, “The Federal Reserve.”  The Federal Reserve is owned lock, stock and barrel, by the Sabbatean/Rothschild Banking Empire and not by the people or the corporate government of the United States.

The Great Depression of 1929, like so many other catastrophes before and after this date was actually a staged event, concocted by the Sabbatean/Rothschild and Rockefeller Banking Empires; the Queen and British Parliament; the US President and Congress; the Vatican and numerous Elite families to steal America’s gold and silver reserves and replace it with, “Negotiable Debt Instruments” or Script money.  Their theft was ingenious and by allowing the public to fall on hard times, the public soon began to demand that the government fix the problem by any means necessary!

This was like self mutilation being repaired with a band-aid!

NOTE:  While everyone struggled in this Country to survive, President Roosevelt and the Congress were making interest bearing loans to Foreign Governments, using the very money they publicly swore did not exist!  Germany used that money to enlarge their War Chest.  The American public however was so self-indulged about their own personal fate that they never considered or asked how it was possible that all of the above government individuals, never personally lost a dime during the Great Depression and how they all continued to enjoy their family estates and personal wealth!  Remember the term, “functional illiterates?”  Need I say more?

We all have been trained to believe that someone not born on American soil is an alien however we forget to consider that the Declaration of Independence was written completely by aliens and not one adult Colonist or Founding Father was born on American soil!  The Immigration Laws of the United States are contrary to the Declaration of Independence and the biggest Terrorist on the planet is now the United States Government!  This fact will be further discussed later on.

Following the 1933 bankruptcy; most American’s were not aware that HR 1491 or HR 4960 had been secretly passed, wherein the US Congress actually relinquished our right to have or accumulate gold and silver.  The Congress eventually repealed part of this legislation to accommodate jewelers but all Americans’ are still prohibited from having or accumulating solid gold and silver.  Hence, our coins are no longer solid gold or silver but are tin and nickel plated, carbon filled coins.  Pennies are tin and copper plated carbon filled coins.  These Acts also established the requirement of licensing and then with the enactment of ‘The Trading with the Enemy Act’ under War and National Defense; the Confiscation Act, the Reconstruction Act and the Lieber Code were all tied together to create the secret fascist government of the United States.

NOTE: The word ‘license’ is defined in all modern law dictionaries as:  “A permit to do something unlawful.”  Now think about that and consider all the Licenses you currently hold?  Those licenses are civil contracts that have been issued to you by the government only so that you may do something lawful but rather unlawful!

[e.g.]  When two people apply for a marriage license, the two of you enter into a binding contract and by applying for a license to marry, you now have voluntarily included the State as a third party to your marriage!  If things don’t work out in that marriage, the State is first to be satisfied.

[e.g.] Your right to travel is an unalienable right defined by the Declaration of Independence and not a privilege and yet the government demands that you apply for a driver’s license!  Google: Right to travel and read the millions of old Court rulings that cite our right to travel without a license!  PS/ The Courts now refuse to honor those old precedents of law since 1938 because of a Supreme Court case titled:  Erie Railroad v. Tompkins, 304 US 64 (1938).

Mr. Tompkins attempted to walk along a set of Railroad Tracks when he was struck by an appendage fastened to a mail train and he subsequently sued claiming negligence and damages on the part of the Railroad.  What Tompkins didn’t know was that the Railroads were in partnership with the Corporate United States Government and so to protect the Government, the Supreme Court ruled that: ‘Absent a ticket or license, Tompkins was trespassing on railroad property and therefore he was barred from any relief.’

This ruling wiped the slate clean by eliminating all previous Court precedents that occurred prior to the year 1938 concerning our unalienable right to travel and opened a floodgate for new State and Federal Government controls such as: The State Vehicle Codes and the requirement for licensing of everything and anything!

Prior to 1933, we all were proud and peaceful Sovereign inhabitants of America. The Trading with the Enemy Act, the Confiscation Act and the Lieber Code obligated the military government to, ‘peacefully interact with American citizens’ and prohibited them from ‘provoking us or to act belligerently toward us’ [or] they forfeit their ability to profit and loot [or] to securitize our property, equity and credit being held in a Public Trust.

‘Add in’ by ACS Editor

From Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars (pg 9)
“War is therefore the balancing of the system by killing the true creditors (the public which we have taught to exchange true value for inflated currency) and falling back on whatever is left of the resources of nature and regeneration of those resources.”

_____________________________________________________

When we voluntarily or involuntarily entered their Military Courts of Justice, one will frequently hear the prosecutor or defense lawyer argue that: ‘Your comment or actions are a belligerent response’ [or] ‘You are being combative.’  Key words to inform you that you or someone else, is about to be fleeced!  Lawyers will even attempt to provoke you or your witness’s anger in the Court, just so you or they behave belligerently toward them and this is why they do that!

Under Regulation 840-10 of the Military Code and sections of the Administrative Procedures Act and the presence of that Military [gold fringed] Flag on display in the Courtroom, instantly creates a state of emergency meaning that, the moment a police officer stopped you in the exercise of your right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, the police officer became a belligerent!  He is armed and you’re not!  He displays a military rank and you’re a civilian and he has now delivered you into a Military Court of Justice with the intent to ‘pillage and plunder’ within the Admiralty jurisdiction of that Military Court, which is also known as ‘The Law of Prize and Captured Property,’ as defined under Title 10, sections 7651 to 7681 of the Code of Military Justice, March 25, 1862.

As mentioned before, The Reconstruction Act included and changed all state officials into having ‘federal foreign standing.’ The 14th amendment deliberately forced and kept them there and section 2 of the Lieber Code instructs that: ‘A victorious army seizes all money and movable property and holds it in trust,’ and this is exactly what the Corporate United States Government and State Governments did and continue to do because they now perceive themselves to be, ‘a victorious army.’

&gt; I know it's most certainly not the perfect solution. 100% understand that, but how much free will can someone have when they have been forced and oppressed to the point where they are even brainwashed to think that they DESERVE to be oppressed?

How do you know they're oppressed? You've created a strawman(woman) and you're using it to justify a tyrannical law. Referring you to some other comments because they explain that very few women in Denmark wear the face veil and the ones wearing it aren't forced to do it.

This law is passed by the government to pander to their voter base. To make it seem like they're taking a stance against Islam, when it reality it's a non issue. The only thing this law will accomplish is to create a hassle for people who cover their faces for other reasons, like we saw happen in Austrai and to make the Danish muslims feel attacked.

&gt; It's two sides of the same coin, I agree. But I'm genuinely curious to hear of other arguments to combat oppression like this that doesn't involve a ban on burkas. I'm all ears because I would like to see other alternatives.

You believe this law combats oppression? Newsflash, it doesn't. The law itself is oppressive. You can't fight oppression with more oppression... It'd be like trying to put out a fire with more fire.

Who's to say that this is a problem? You assume they're being oppressed, but have you actually talked to women wearing the veil? Do you speak on behalf of Muslim women? I honestly don't think you'll understand that a lot of women choose to wear the veil themselves, because you've already made up your mind on the issue. They're either oppressed and are forced to wear it, or they're brainwashed idiots who can't speak for themselves or what they want.

OK from that perspective then, please explain to me how, from polls taken by the THES after the 2017 GE, over half of those students who voted Labour had their position on Brexit completely wrong?

&gt; Among the respondents, 55 per cent thought that Labour wanted the UK to remain in the European Union, and 58 per cent thought that this was Mr Corbyn’s position.

&gt; A further 32 per cent thought that Labour wanted to leave the EU but to remain in the single market and customs union (24 per cent thought the same of Mr Corbyn), when the party has made no such pledges

Yes that's right, over 80% of 18-21 students in this poll were completely wrong about Labour's position.

So you think we should entrust 16-18 year olds with a vote, when those at 18-21 are incapable of even reading a manifesto? Nah I don't think so.

&gt; I am a parent actually and it's exactly for the reasons you listed as to why I think a re run of the vote is needed before we leave.

You want your legacy of this country, that you hand down to your kid, to be a country where the outcome of national votes can be overruled by the minority when they are unhappy with the outcome, and the majority can be forced to 'think again' until they get it right? Personally I think that that is a very dangerous sentiment, and something you do not want to set a precedent for. Once you open that pandoras box, there is no going back.

&gt; My kids future is permanently altered for the worse (please tell me why I'm wrong otherwise, be specific on atleast a few points as to why he'll be better off out of the EU)

If your perspective is one of the EU being some sort of faultless messiah of a project, then yeah sure dream away. But let's look at actually what our kids will have lost at the end of all this: -

- Right to free movement across Europe to work without a work visa

Oh right that's it isn't it. A single piece of paperwork, that for most people takes around 30 seconds to complete. So now we can look at the things that our children may benefit from: -

 - fairer more inclusive immigration system, that allows global talent equal opportunity instead of a system that prioritizes predominantly white low skilled labour at the cost of others

 - reduction in tariffs for global purchases, with the removal of the common external tariff, reducing the costs of food clothing and footwear from outside of the EU by as much as 15%

 - reduction in annual influx of cheap labour, allowing for increases in wages from supply and demand, and higher prospects for work when still young and unemployed, just starting out

 - higher quality goods within the UK marketplace, due to increased competition by removing the unfair protectionist CET which prevents global competition on goods

 - lower cost of living through higher likelihood of accessing housing at a fair price, through changes to supply and demand

 - better access to emerging markets, increasing likelihood of stronger gdp growth

All the above are possibilities for the future, that are not currently possible within the EU.

Ambassador Monika Schmutz Kirgoz, who is one year into her posting, said her country is committed for the long haul, even amid fears that the international community is experiencing donor fatigue as the Syrian war drags into its eighth year.

The small European country has given Lebanon over $100 million in aid since the beginning of the Syrian war in 2011, and will give over $20 million this year. It has also, along with other European countries, increased aid to the United Nations relief agency for Palestinians in the wake of U.S. funding cuts, she noted.

Schmutz Kirgoz maintained that her country was ahead of the pack in understanding the necessity of funding projects that benefit the Lebanese communities that host the bulk of the 1 million-plus Syrian refugees living in the country.

Swiss investments have included rehabilitating schools in north Lebanon and implementing water projects in the Bekaa.

“I think we were the first country who was focusing on the host communities,” the ambassador told The Daily Star. “We were the first country saying, ‘Look, this is a small country with ... a fragile context regionally ... we have to invest in this country, which is welcoming these suffering people.’”

The ambassador said the Lebanese should not fear any downturn in support from her country.

“On the contrary – [aid] is increasing, and even now we are not only giving humanitarian aid, but we are working on long-term projects,” she said. “Because you cannot say after seven years this is still humanitarian aid – it becomes something much more systematic that we have to think about in the middle and the long term, and we are doing this.”

She added: “What Lebanon is doing is absolutely incredible. This is a unique act of humanity and solidarity to receive all these people who had to [leave] their country.”

Switzerland has some precedent for the situation in its own history, she noted: The country was one of the largest recipients of refugees from Kosovo in the 1990s.

Schmutz Kirgoz also addressed frankly one of the reasons that Switzerland and other European countries have poured resources into Lebanon amid the Syrian crisis.

“Some of the Lebanese political voices – sometimes very critically – state that we only stand with Lebanon because we don’t want all of these migrants to come to Europe,” she said. “It is not entirely wrong.”

But, she added, that fact should reassure the Lebanese that international support will continue.

Apart from the refugee issue, the ambassador said Switzerland has strong economic and cultural ties to, and a “mutual love and admiration” for, Lebanon. The two countries are similar in that they are “two small nations with no natural resources except the beauty of the landscape,” she said. “All we are is brain-driven.”

These qualities have resulted in an active banking and financial sector in both countries, as well as a keen appreciation of art and culture, she said.

Schmutz Kirgoz continued that the “intellectual freedom” of Lebanon was one of its most attractive qualities to her.

She said she had felt “immediately welcomed” when she arrived in the country.

“I think there’s really something unique about the human touch here, absolutely,” she said.

And she said the differences between the countries increase their mutual fascination. “We love them [the Lebanese] because they are warm-hearted, loud, hospitable, unorganized, they know how to party, they know how to invite, they eat so well and everything is always in abundance. And we are serious and not so funny and more on the stingy side. And I think each one wants to be like the other,” she said.

The ambassador, however, said that she hopes to find ways to support the country in developing a culture that respects rule of law.

Upon her arrival in Lebanon, she was “very surprised that each and every politician I met complained about the corruption. ... Everyone complains about it, but somehow I would suppose that someone has to be responsible.”

Emphasizing environmental regulations, she said, “Rule of law has to be implemented, and I don’t say [this] for me, I say it for the children of this beautiful country.”",True,False,False,,0,1533282153,,False,0,e3iwct5,True,t3_947mdl,True,t3_947mdl,/r/lebanon/comments/947mdl/swiss_envoy_pledges_ongoing_support_to_unique/e3iwct5/,,1537029371,1,True,False,lebanon,t5_2qzpg,r/lebanon,public,

Russia doesn’t affiliate themselves with too much with North Korea, but some speculate Russia helped North Korea obtain nuclear capabilities more quickly. They share a small border as well.

So the speculations revolved around [Russian scientists supporting DPRK's nuclear and missile programs in the 90's](https://www.businessinsider.com/russian-scientists-north-korea-newest-missile-designs-2018-1) and [DPRK's ICBM efforts being traced to a Ukrainian facility \(with ties to Russia through the Black Sea Fleet\)](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/14/world/asia/north-korea-missiles-ukraine-factory.html). The Russian government doesn't seem to have much to do with it, and has been fairly critical of DPRK's nuclear/missile programs. I think most importantly DPRK's nuclear program destabilizes the region and encourages proliferation, which harms Russia's national security and status as one of the few nuclear powers.

Russia does try to establish itself in others ways, like when it forgave 90% of DPRK in exchange for energy/education/health investments or [when it didn't enforce various sanctions on them](http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/2018/171&amp;referer=/english/&amp;Lang=E). But these are far from substantial ties that one would expect from allies (significant military cooperation, intel sharing, etc.). It appears more as bilateral cooperation on specific issues rather than an alliance, just like Russia+Iran.

&gt;They see an ally of theirs [N. Korea] get brought up to the world stage by meeting face to face with the leader of the free world. They get respect and confirmation from the American president and one of their biggest parties, the GOP, that the Crimea takeover was legitimate; and they get American soft power removed from the Korean peninsula.

Think this is jumping the gun. Russia is not an ally of DPRK and doesn't necessarily even want them to benefit from this whole fiasco. Russia wants to use this to make themselves relevant on the national stage, as if this were the Concert of Europe again. 

From this issue, little changes about the American perception of Russia. Russia intervening will have little effect on the outcome of the talks, barring some sort of extraordinary event. Even if they did, I think the non-Trump GOP would be reticent to improve their views on Russia, much less capitulate on Crimea and be seen as feckless and weak compared to the Democrats. Remember that even Trump disingenuously claims to be tougher on Russia than Obama (his base doesn't care, but NeverTrump GOPers and independents do).

I beg to differ especially on that one. At the time, around 1950, Germans still didn't know how history would develop and did not feel as separate countries like they did some decades later. Perhaps one might even say they felt less divided than they do today. Refugees from Silesia, Pomerania and East Prussia often didn't just flee across Odra and Nysa but further into the Western zones, so just like every other family has got ancestors from there (including my own grandma) there is a widespread attachment to these areas. Don't worry: a folkloristic kind of attachment, not the ""give it back!"" kind.

&gt; Both East Germany and Poland weren't sovereign.

Following that logic we should reset our border to the 1939 status and then start negotiating from scratch (what you do with Russia, Belarus and the Ukraine in the east would be your business).

Don't get me wrong. I'm not a fan of any irredentism. In our day and age if I have a sudden urge to see Wrocław or Słupsk I can just go and visit.

-------------------------------------------------

as someone who loves skating: let me point out a few things. ill also talk about the wheels, as i have one of those types

theres a lot to do with bearings. if you want to reach for the high end and anticipate not only using them well but using them for a long time, ceramics are a good buy. theyre expensive up-front, but theyre slightly better than steel bearings in terms of speed and energy retention. during my first skate on them i actually straight up overshot a corner i typically take at high speed because i was not expecting them to maintain as much speed as they did under cornering. ceramics also benefit from a longer service life for two reasons: the ceramic of the balls (and of the races in some bearings) is not only more durable, but theyre not metal, thus theyre immune to the damage and degradation brought about by rust. the bearings outer shell is made of steel still, but the bearings tend to sort of polish the metal under load if anything

if you dont want to shell out for ceramics, you can grab some standard grade abec 7s or something. however, you must be wary in water/mud unless you specifically purchase a bearing that was designed to resist water as best it can

as a final thought on bearings, you should still clean your current ones for practice of doing so if you never have. you can clean them with wd40 provided you rinse, dry, and relubricate them afterward. you can use other solvents (pretty sure i used naphtha once - i figured if its excellent at removing gunk out of the fretboards of bass guitars, itll do much the same to a bearing). theres citrus cleaners, isopropyl, blah blah

---------------------------------

wheels: i actually have seba luminous wheels on my skates at the moment (PINK MASTER RACE). ill break these wheels into pros/cons

PROS:
1) safety: these wheels are BRIGHT. you can see them well away at a distance. if you skate at dusk to midnight like i do, these can be a potential lifesaver
2) style: this is an excellent style accentuation and attention-getter if you desire it. ive been complimented literally every time ive ever gone skating. they come in a good range of colors
3) stability: the wheels are reliable. they degrade predictably/evenly and become softer, gripper, and faster (see con #1) once the outer glassy layer is worn off
4) construction: despite the abuse ive put through the wheels via torsion, impact of jumping, downhill sprints, etc., the wheels have exhibited no chunking, cracking, flat spotting (no, i dont do slides/power stops - i dont want to shred up my wheels by doing such a thing anyway), or any other anomalous defect
5) power consumption: since the wheels operate by magnets whizzing around some metal, theres no batteries required. you move, they illuminate, and thats all there is to it

CONS:
1) speed: the magnet spacers (would they technically be magnetos?) do naturally generate friction, as they rub against the inside of the wheel. though i have notice no damage to any of them, this does generate friction that will reduce your absolute top speed. when it comes to acceleration, since friction of the bearings is less important, theres no real difference. they will retain their energy almost as well as a standard wheel. i noticed the wheels to be substantially slower at first, but by the time i wore away the glassy ""im a new wheel :D"" layer, the wheels seemed faster - but they physically cannot be as fast as a normal wheel
2) shipping: usually have to be ordered overseas unless youre in europe, in which theyll have to clear customs. i actually had to sign for mine",True,False,False,,0,1533286920,,False,0,e3iys2x,False,t3_940tzy,True,t3_940tzy,/r/rollerblading/comments/940tzy/confused_about_what_kind_of_wheels_bearings_to_get/e3iys2x/,,1537030505,1,True,False,rollerblading,t5_2r7my,r/rollerblading,public,

Read an article a few months ago so the details are fuzzy but the german air force has few operational planes, most need repair or are not flightworthy, it was the same story with armor and other equipment, lots of disrepair and not functioning equipment. They would need to raise taxes a whole lot to make that a reality and be able to defend themselves without NATO intervention.

Well I would just go a different route. Leave Nato, dismantle the military even further and just build a few state of the art thermonuclear bombs as deterrence. Just don't have a active military aside from the maintenance and control of the nukes. Retrain military personal to police, intelligence agents, fire fighter and catastrophe protection. Maybe have a few highly trained special ops for any kind of foreign rescue missions, but that should be it in my opinion.

Lets be real, as the world is right now, no one is ever gonna actually attack europe or germany for that matter. Europe and Germany is way to important as a market for every global military power to even think of touching us. And everyone who is not a major benefactor of our markets doesn't have the military capabilities to actually go to war with Europe even if we would all dismantle our military completely.

So i think we actually could leave NATO and save a shit ton of money (at least in the long run after investing in some nukes).

&gt; I didn’t understand how little the government adds but adding a 7.5% tax on employees and employers wouldn’t work here.

Elect politicians who aren't influenced by money and woudln't leave open loopholes for certain benefactors. In the end you are paying the taxes anyway. Be it either through out of pocket private health costs, high cost of private insurance or lower wages since employers can over insurance as a benefit. I know it's a weird culture thing that as soon you hear taxes you start flipping your shit, but you really would benefit in the end when you overcome this stigma. You could often save a lot of money. Remember that there is no country in the world that spends so much for healthcare per capita then the US (private spending and government spending combined). You spend about 9500 int. $ per capita for your healthcare. That is 2000 int. $ more then Switzerland (famous for their unmatched highend quality of care) spend per capita and 4000 int.$ more Germany per capita. And that's PPP and inflation-adjusted.

I used six years old boys arm length since this was easier and it had less variability as say the head or height. (see the podcast for the ""Hiro 13,5 arms"" ;)) The calculation says, that the tree must be around 2000 Years old, which is bullshit. Cherry trees don't get that old, depending on the kind, they get around 100 years old. Especially, on a barren earth. But wait, there is more! 

We can use other ""numbers"" that the show gave us. Let's just use our timeline by starting and cutting 500 years of. We are now back into the late medieval 1518 anno Domini. Shit is all over the place, knights still exist, the church is kind of a dick, and we live kind of happy in Europe. It took us less than 500 years to come up with skyscrapers, and for this to happen, we kind of need to invent or drive math a significant portion forward. Things that the Children and immortals don't need to because they have the supercomputer, Dr. FranXX password, and energy to actually get the needed information out of the machine. 

Then there are still the immortals and all saved memory of every single human on this computer. There are still plantations, all the military tech, and one more VERY important thing: The Garden! With all his medical staff and since stuff and genetics and so on and so forth. So basically the children do not start from fucking 1518 anno Domini, they build alternative energy sources after very little years (USA is still not able to, what does THAT tell you? ;)). There is actually one more very important scientifically clue. After the explosion on the VIRM planet, Zero Twos Statue crumbles to dust and we see a small cherry seedling. RIGHT after that, the sky starts to glow, and it keeps glowing for two days. This is the clearest sign that Hir02 were not ""million of million lightyears away"". Nope, there were ""right around the space corner"". This light, the scientific progress we see in the background of the tree tells me, that around 100 to 300 years may have passed. You can agree or disagree, but keep my points in your head when you try to determine the ""time skip"". Consider all the existing technology, consider the Garden, the free love, the plantations that did not explode. Certainly, there were a lot more considering the Numbers behind the plantations.

Major Update: 
I’m rewatching the show right now, and I come to realize, that there is significantly more left on earth an even more people. We have the underground facilities where the spear was built, we still have the facilities where the FranXX have been build and one not so small thing the “farm”. Remember the food the children got. Fresh vegetables, eggs, meat, and honey. This stuff does not grow on trees ;). 
There are more plantations left, then gone! In episode 15, APE is saying that they have lost 40% of Squads. Assuming that every plantation has a squad plus a view extra squads exist like the 9s. I thus mean, that there are way more left. The Plantationsnumbers are also very hight, hinting again, that there are way more. These plantations, are gigantic, everyone could easily establish a city. Explaining the shot where we see the earth with multiple cities. 




In my podcast, I talked about how a new season could look like, and I try to analyze the outro, for all that I needed to establish a common ground, and I started by explaining how many time has passed.

False,FongDeng,1503339284.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_a215esk,"&gt;Russia punches above its weight, not in spite of geography, but *because* of geography. Invading from the west, Russian forces can retreat to the east and south. Invading from the east, Russian forces can retreat to the west and north. The western borders of the Soviet Union rapidly collapsed during the initial German offensive during World War 2, but Russia was able to draw the German army deeper into its territory, through the Russian winter, and make a stand at Moscow and Stalingrad. At the time, Russian strategic depth in Siberia was not as developed as it is today. In modern times, even with the fall of major cities in the west, Russia would still be able to draw strong military reserves from its eastern commands, and use its vast territory to wear down opponents.

This was true back when Moscow commanded an empire that encompassed all of Eastern Europe but now much of that vast buffer is gone. Many of their old buffer states have now gone over to NATO. If the Wehrmacht had started from where NATO is now they would have been in Moscow within a month. Part of why Russia is trying to expand now is because they want that buffer space back. And European Russia accounts for 77% of its population and more than 50% of its GDP. There is absolutely no way the Russians could survive losing its territory in the west and that's assuming an attack only occurs from that direction, which is by no means a guarantee. Without its nuclear deterrent, Russia would be dangerously vulnerable to conventional attack. 

&gt;Having a relatively smaller population, and less developed industries, actually helps in this regard, because an enemy wouldn't be able to move from victory to victory through capturing key Russian economic regions, or threaten Russians with total destruction with anything less than a nuclear winter's worth of missiles. As a result, Russia's nuclear deterrence is much more secure than that of its rivals, and its conventional deterrence is equally strong 

Actually Moscow alone accounts for more than 10 percent of its population and about one third of its GDP (in addition to being the capital) so just losing that city would be devastating. In contrast a nuclear strike on New York would take out less than 3% of the US's population and less than 10% if its GDP and you wouldn't have taken out the capital. For this reason I think Russia is more vulnerable to a nuclear attack than the US or China. 

&gt;It doesn't surprise me, in this respect, that Russia is one of the few powers in the world today that does not give much of a damn about the US's hegemonic status, but is completely willing to risk the US's retaliation in pursuit of its own interests, despite its vastly inferior economy. Outside of Russia, I can barely think of another country that, having seen what happened to Saddam in Iraq, would be willing to challenge the US's strategic goals around the world. Countries like Iran and even China do not have that luxury - they are immensely threatened by the prospect of an US military attack or resource embargo. 

China and Iran are willing to challenge US strategic interests and do so quite frequently. Look at Iran supporting proxies in Iraq, Syria and Yemen or China's claims in the South China Sea. I would say China, by attempting to undermine US naval supremacy, is actually challenging the one strategic goal the US holds most dear.   


Russia might be more blatant in its attempts to thwart US hegemony but I think that's more due to the fact that they are a fading power. Russia won't be stronger in the future so they have to act quickly. China on the other hand, can afford to wait and being patient will likely be to their benefit. Why overtly challenge the US now when later on you'll have a stronger economy and military?

But I'll bite. First of all I think there is a difference between mythologizing about the European or Aryan 'white' race and ""every post-colonial writer that craps on the legacy of Europe."" Firstly, I'm not even sure who you're talking about? The postcolonial writers I know critique the contingent basis of such a concept as Europe in the first place. Maybe you've read ones that do what you accuse them of but I know that it's not every single one of them

Secondly I don't think it's controversial to say that even though European civilizations had many cultures and ethnicities, it also had dominant oppressive institutions and powers which wielded control and often brutalized said cultures and ethnicities.

False,Flayed_Angel,1511407491.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_krpfs47,"This is silly for a few simple reasons.  

You can go back and watch Joanna's fights and it's obvious she has changed to be more defensively minded with girls trying to take her head off.  That's her coaches at ATT telling her to stop trying to stand and bang like she did vs Valerie and KK.  She will still explode into girls with technical counters if they give her an opening as Rose found out in their last fight and as Tecia found out in their 3rd round where JJ was just getting warmed up.

Also Pat and Rose's coaches had years to study Joanna and pick up on her mannerisms to exploit them while Joanna had to constantly prep for title defenses vs grapplers and pressure fighters.  Also there was really only one match to compare them.  The second.  You can't compare fighters when one is so medically compromised that they are missing punches by 4 feet and kicks by 6 feet.  So they had a poor example to build a rematch on.  It's not like Conor/Nate I where you can see both of their skills at their best so you can learn from it and coach from it.  Even that was a close fight for their second out.  So all things considered JJ didn't do too badly despite all of the disadvantages.

Rose has had virtually every possible advantage thrown her way, apart from the Tecia fight, including not having to deal with any grappler since Carla.  It's not even clear she will face Andrade at this point especially if Andrade gets injured.  Also lets not forget they actually began to psychologically fuck with Joanna way back at UFC 211 with Joanna pulling a Rose and ignoring it but everyone forgets that.  Why do people think Pat and Rose was there.  It wasn't by chance.

Also Joanna is big for the weight class but has an odd shape (narrow shoulders eliminating her reach advantage with big legs).  At 115 this puts her in an odd position where she has to stay in a calorie deficit throughout her camp.  A calorie deficit means you only have X amount of time in the gym and conditioning takes precedence over skill development.  They do work on skill but you won't ever see significant changes when they might only have a handful of skill development sessions throughout a 8-12 week camp.

EDIT:  

So I was watching Cody's videos for UFC 227 and [found this bit important.](https://youtu.be/ovHQQ9AfDrE?t=338)  The UFC's marketing team actively monitors and passively directs their top fighter's social media and no doubt it's the same for their other PR obligations.  Why does this matter in the context of Joanna's development.  

It's just something else fighters have to commit effort and more importantly mental energy and time to.  It's why Cyborg doesn't do her own social media and Rose doesn't do it at all.  Joanna on the other hand can't trust others to do her own social media after she has been scammed so many times in her career and has spent roughly 3-4 solid months out of a year doing PR outside of the US.  Commercials, photo-shoots, reality-tv style instagram stories (although she does those in the US as well).  People here don't really see it because the vast majority of that content isn't aimed at the US consumer but Europe and Poland specifically.

There are a few months out of a year outside of camp when Joanna does train at ATT doing skill development but she still has to maintain a very strict diet keeping her from spending more time in the gym.  It has nothing to do with her supposed lack of dedication.  In his latest podcast (fight strength podcast on itunes) her S&amp;C coach said they have had to tell Joanna no and keep her out of the gym.  The situation the two camps/fighters are in is just vastly different.  It's just a matter of calories and time and Rose has significantly more to spend with virtually zero media/pr pressure going nearly 5 years now.

Even this week Joanna closes out a whooping 4 days with her family and she is off doing PR for about 2 months.  She is the new face of Disney in Europe.  Then it's back to ATT and they hope to have her do skill development leading into her title fight.  Now they saw them fight for real and can develop programming to deal with it better.

Of course the UFC can sabotage this too by having Joanna fight someone else on a card in a few months then send her into a rematch with Rose with again nearly no time for skill development.

I would not be shocked if Rose magically recovers to face Andrade at the end of the year and defeats her in a decision especially if the UFC forces Andrade to face Rose at the end of the year without the necessary time for skill development then it's off to a 3rd fight vs JJ with nearly no chance of being dominated and so nearly no chance of losing the belt.",True,False,False,,0,1533294872,,1533301442,0,e3j2x4b,False,t3_943m0j,False,t3_943m0j,/r/WMMA/comments/943m0j/pat_barry_joanna_jedrzejczyk_fcking_herself_over/e3j2x4b/,,1537032432,7,True,False,WMMA,t5_2vpyi,r/WMMA,public,

I went back and re-watched the interview, and I concede this to be true and my statement to be false. That said, even that collection of evasions and deflections is closer to any indication of when the UK will benefit than anyone else has given.  
  
&gt;apparently it's all hard fact  
  
Oh *if only* it were all hard fact.  
  
&gt;And the remain side's 'playing fair' included using taxpayers money to campaign in a biased manner,  
  
Oh no. People spent money that they weren't supposed to spend. That's far worse than the heaps upon heaps of lies, smokescreens, hopeless optimism and cow-staring-at-an-oncoming-train levels of risk assessment. If this is the best Leave can come up with, and as far as I can tell it very much seems to be, then shit son this is not an argument you should be getting into.  
  
&gt; messing around with the voting registration deadline to get as many last minute remainers on board as possible  
  
The fucking [website crashed](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/07/eu-referendum-voter-registration-site-crashes-before-deadline) mate not everything is a conspiracy against you.  
  
&gt;telling us we'd face economic ruin, immediate recession and possibly even another European war.  
  
Well without the CAP subsidy for farmers, according to the most recent edition of Private Eye, only 8% of UK farms will be able to turn a profit, which means considerable farm closures which means less food. Without a trade deal of some kind we're already accepting massive delays on any imports coming in from the EU, a sizable chunk of which will be food. If people can't eat then people can't work, if people can't work then people don't earn money, currency ceases to be stimulated to the same extent causing devaluation as the lack of trading will be seen as a lack of consumer confidence. The pound took a hit the day the vote was announced, just talking about Brexit was enough to damage an economy that was meant to be *far* too fragile to be left to a Labour Government, much less Brexit. As for the recession, well shit we'll see if that happens in about eight months.  
  
As for the war thing, we're now one for one in terms of misquoting because Davey C didn't say that, what he said was: """"Can we be so sure peace and stability on our continent are assured beyond any shadow of doubt? Is that a risk worth taking?""  
  
&gt;So let's just chill out with this holier than thou moral crusade you think you're on  
  
Any crusade I'm on is highly unlikely to be very moral, mate, all I'm doing is calling bullshit on this sudden wave of ""hey let's be friends"" rhetoric. It's not just OP here, I personally have been offered a proverbial olive branch by a couple of Leavers on here, and this is becoming a trend. I think Leavers are starting to realise, with eight months to go, next to no progress on any issue regarding trade, relations, investment, borders or travel, with no guarantees, no deals, no uplifting optimism and no flocking of the Remainers to the Leave banner, that something somewhere has gone horribly horribly wrong and, shock horror, it might just be Leave's fault...so after two years of insults and abuse up to and including death threats, *now* Leave wants to be friends? Fuck all the way off.  
  
&gt;ecause the fact of the matter is that the remain, side have used as many underhand tactics as the people you're so determined to attack here.  
  
Yes I'm sure the data-mining, co-operation between campaigns, defying the campaigning suspension after the murder of Jo Cox, the piles upon piles of lies are entirely morally equivalent to a website crashing and a leaflet campaign.

Well no. Totalitarianism is what the Communist Parties in Eastern Europe applied, because the people in charge of the KPSS (who controlled all the other Communist Parties in the Eastern Bloc) were totalitarians, after Revolution + Civil War + Purges. They were not the only Communist Parties in Europe. The PCI in Italy also called themselves Communist yet they had a different ideology than Stalin. Heck, before the Bolsheviks came into power, in Russia there were a lot of socialist parties with many different views on how to achieve communism, but they were fucked after the October Revolution. Communism is the theoretical stage in which there is collective ownership of the means of production, and no state, in which people freely live sharing all their possessions and amicably solving their disputes. Of course if you ask me trying to reach this stage with a whole country is completely stupid. But that doesn't mean it cannot exist in small scale, in fact many Hippie communes exist where communism can be contemplated. How to reach that stage has one million variants, and one political though associated with each variant.

Totalitarianism means the almost absolute control of all parts of life by the state, which is contradictory of the objective of communism in the first place: getting rid of the state. I think anyway is the natural progression of trying to enforce communism to a whole country in a short period of time, this natural development doesn't negate the contradiction of having a totalitarian communism. Let's say that by trying to enforce communism by totalitarian means already transform your ideology from communism to something else, something bizarre and absurd that is which many countries sadly experienced in the last century. I call it Bolshevism.

Now, it is obvious that Hitler used the discontent of the working classes for the benefit of the Nazis. He used socialist rhetoric to gain votes and support. One of the things Nazis are famous for is lies, manipulation and propaganda, and they were masters of it. The average Hans in Germany had many friends on the Great War, and all his suffering only served to make Germany smaller and its economy suffer. Then the Great Depression hit and he lost his job or the inflation was so high that he could barely afford food. He was very pissed, and he knew his boss was a dick that abused his workers. Then suddenly Hitler came and told him that his suffering should be adressed, and he agreed. Then Hitler told him that the Jews were the one guilty of making Germany lose the war, and they were also the owners of many big banks in Germany and the World, being guilty of the bad economy. Hans remembered that when he was little people said all of bad things about the Jews, so he believed Hitler. Why would Hitler lie, he was a very convincing guy, and spoke with so much passion he could only be telling the truth.

After Hitler came to power he didn't create socialist policies. He simply refused to follow Versailles, confiscated many wealth of Jewish people, privatised public companies. With this the State had enough money to invest heavily in public spending like rebuilding the army, building infrastructure and giving some welfare to the poor guys (as long as they were not Jews, gypsies or the like), and still Germany was massively in debt just before the War started. But the Nazis didn't empower the unions or the working class in any way, he just gave them some welfare to keep them quiet and happy. Like the Romans did in the famous ""Bread and circuses"", like Bismarck did. ""If people have something to eat and their pleasures, then they have their socialism."" exemplifies exactly this thought. It means ""if you keep the working class happy with some welfare so they don't die, they hace the socialism they were looking for in that"". Real socialism would mean reduce wealth inequality, help the poor classes sustain themselves, give them a voice in their working place, help them get a good job and become better, etc. Which the Nazis didn't do.",True,False,False,,0,1533296188,,False,0,e3j3s0r,False,t3_93f4gv,True,t1_e3j0cl6,/r/europe/comments/93f4gv/what_do_you_know_about_the_soviet_union/e3j3s0r/,,1537032842,3,True,False,europe,t5_2qh4j,r/europe,public,

Anyway, if we ignore the monarchy requirement I do think the United States would be an empire, and here's why. The word empire is obviously from the Roman empire, where Julius Caesar used the title imperator once he basically had complete king-like control over things. Imperator just meant military commander, but Caesar and other later emperors used it because they couldn't call themselves king (rex) because Romelans generally hated the idea of having a king. They had become a republic after overthrowing a tyrannical king, so they didn't want a new one.

The end result there is basically that emperor is a fancy word for king. But there is more to the story. For most of European history, the term empire was reserved for something claiming to be Roman. The Holy Roman Empire, the Latin Empire, the Russian Empire, the French Empire. I think the German empire is where the Roman requirement ended. I'm also not sure how much it was used historically, but the word emperor was also used for foreign rulers of similar importance to a Roman emperor. So China which happened to have a similar story of someone inventing a new title above king had an emperor. There's the Persian empire, the Ottomans were an empire too.

Another point where it gets confusing is the word imperialism, and I think this is probably the worst part of it. Because there was a british empire, but Britain never had an emperor. Suddenly empire can just mean a lot of land you took over. This is where that multi-cultural requirement showed up I think. From this, suddenly anything can be an empire. Sweden can have an empire even. 

Anyway, point being the term empire is weird and cultural diversity isn't a requirement for it, so I think a country with land area significantly larger than the Roman empire can be an empire.",True,False,False,,0,1533297935,,False,0,e3j50t5,False,t3_93n4y1,True,t1_e3itcd8,/r/CrusaderKings/comments/93n4y1/when/e3j50t5/,,1537033423,1,True,False,CrusaderKings,t5_2tgic,r/CrusaderKings,public,

I'm surprised by hydro power/cost being worse than fossil or nuke? When GW order dams can last near to a century, you are well past paying back the capital cost, and operating cost/maintenance must be minimal. Is this due to load factors?       

Woudlnt you agree that hydro was such a no brainer for decades that for developed countries there just isn't any room for major development; you just need extra mountains?     

My main worry is that renewables haven't delivered anything comparable to what France did in the 80s. Sure, it would be good if it worked, but so far those who have put all their eggs in intermittent renewable (not talking to you Iceland and Norway) ended up filling their production with fossil.

At this pace ( (502-425)/(2014-2002)=6.5g/year) ), it would take them ( (502-35)/6.5=72 years) to reach the level of dirty nuclear France, who cut its CO2/kWh by 10 in 15 years at about -50g/year.

From the beginning of his Administration, President Trump has taken action to defend our election system from meddling and interference.
In May 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order to strengthen and review the cybersecurity of our Nation and its critical infrastructure.
This has included long-delayed modernization of our cyber security systems across the Government.
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has taken the lead in working with all 50 states, local governments, and private companies to improve election security and integrity.
Under President Trump, DHS has increased coordination and information sharing among all election partners, with nearly 1000 elections jurisdictions, including all 50 states, participating in the Election Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
34 States, 52 county or local governments, and 5 election companies receive cyber security scans from DHS, free of charge, on an ongoing basis.
DHS plans to provide on-site risk and vulnerability assessments to all States that request. Currently 18 States have requested this assessment and 16 are completed for the 2018 election cycle.
A new pilot program was launched to share information between State and local officials and the Election Assistance Commission to allow for rapid response on Election Day.
During the 2017 elections, the Trump Administration provided on-site cybersecurity support to States.
In March of 2018, Congress provided the Election Assistance Commission with $380 million in funding for election assistance grants to States.
While increasing our election security, the Trump Administration is also combatting actors that have already attempted to harm our election integrity.
In March 2018, the Administration imposed sanctions against 16 Russian entities and individuals for their roles in Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential election.
CONFRONTING RUSSIAN INFLUENCE IN THE UNITED STATES: President Trump has taken action to call out and confront Russian efforts that undermine the United States.

In March 2018, President Trump ordered the expulsion of 48 Russian intelligence officers from the United States and ordered the closure of the Russian consulate in Seattle, Washington.
This action was taken in coordination with American allies around the world in response to Russia’s use of a military-grade chemical weapon in the United Kingdom.
In March 2018, President Trump also expelled 12 Russian intelligence officers from the Russian Mission to the United Nations in New York for abusing their privilege of residence.
In September 2017, the Administration banned the use of Kaspersky Labs software on United States Government computers due to Kaspersky’s ties to Russian intelligence.
In March 2017, the Administration charged 3 Russians for the 2014 Yahoo hack, including 2 officers of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB).
The Trump Administration has maintained the closure of 2 Russian compounds and the expulsion of 35 diplomats in response to Russian interference in the 2016 election.
REINFORCING A STRONG SANCTIONS REGIME ON RUSSIA: The Administration has imposed the toughest sanctions against Russia to confront its destabilizing behavior.

President Trump’s Administration has consistently confronted Russian activities that threaten our institutions, our interests, or our allies.
In June 2018, President Trump’s Administration imposed sanctions against 5 Russian entities and 3 Russian individuals for enabling Russia’s military and intelligence units to increase Russia’s offensive cyber capabilities.
In April 2018, the Administration imposed sanctions against 7 Russian oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control, 17 senior Russian government officials, and a state-owned Russian weapons trading company and a bank it owns.
These sanctions ensure the Russian oligarchs who profit from Russia’s destabilizing activities face the consequences for doing so.
The sanctioned state-owned weapons trading company provides military equipment and support to the Government of Syria, enabling the regime’s continual attacks against Syrian citizens.
In February 2018, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network proposed a new rule to bar a Latvian bank involved in illicit Russia-related activity from opening or maintaining correspondent accounts in the United States.
In December 2017, new Russia-related sanctions were announced under the Sergei Magnitsky and Global Magnitsky programs.
In December 2017, the Administration imposed export controls against 2 Russian companies that were helping Russia develop missiles that violate the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF).
The Trump Administration sanctioned a total of 100 targets in response to Russia’s ongoing occupation of Crimea and aggression in Eastern Ukraine.
The Trump Administration has also designated Russian actors under Iran and North Korea sanctions authorities.
CONFRONTING RUSSIAN AGGRESSION: The President is strengthening our alliances and standing up to Russia’s malign influence across the globe.

The Trump Administration released a National Security Strategy that makes clear that Russia is undertaking actions that threaten our security and outlines steps to stop their interference.
The Trump Administration has increased funding for the European Deterrence Initiative, providing billions to increase United States troop readiness in Europe, deter Russian aggression, and help defend our NATO allies.
The Trump Administration has enhanced its support for Ukraine’s Armed Forces to help Ukraine improve its ability to defend itself.
The Trump Administration is working to pressure Russia back into compliance with the INF Treaty to ensure that Russia does not gain strategic advantage from its treaty violations.

Are you trying to say that 'diverse' is precisely anything non-male, non-white, and non-Christian?  Or are you still claiming that is what 'white people' think?  Even within the group of white-male Christians I can see lots of 'diversity', but that word has a different meaning now when talking about ethnicity- doesn't it?  Why?  Who is it that is claiming white-male Christians are not diverse, white-male Christians?  'Diversity', as it has been used lately, is a propaganda term.  You seem to be upset at the people who are using the term to mock it- they are not the ones who designed what that word implies (and you seem to know well what it implies).  The term is appearing casually and unironically in media mostly pertaining to 'white'-majority societies, so it has cast down into everyday conversation.  Are you aware enough to wonder why, or are you aware why and are happy with its use?

In *your* eyes, Ghana should not be a diverse country and Japan should not be a diverse country, but I'm not so sure you'd agree with that because they are non-white.  In *my* eyes, those countries have many small ethnic groups which together form the larger identites of Ghanaian and Japanese.  The same goes for 'white' people.  All of the races are already diverse, so why does Europe (even non-colonial countries) *need* 'diversity'?  Why/how is this subject so prevalent?

Do you *want* to live around white people?  If so, I can understand why.  If not, I am fully in support of 'your people' having a sovereign nation exclusive to themselves.

Why do you expect ordinary people on average salaries with no education past the age of 16 or 18 to be able to assess that?

I'm not blaming anyone here, but an authority can only govern with the will of the people, and the EU really failed to get the British public on board. 

You can blame the British media if you will, but the reality is that all media just prints what sells papers / advertising. The very fact that ordinary British people went out to vote against the EU really brings to light the failure of the EU to get people on side. 

Seeing the post-Brexit reaction across Europe has really driven that home the EU's inability to understand the British public. It's all ""Britain wants extra sausage"", ""Britain still thinks its an empire"". Nobody seems to legitimately consider the possibility that Britain's history and geography has, over the past few hundred years, has led to a significant divide between British and many continental European nations in a value-free way, and then supposed that this cultural divide might explain why the EU failed to garner the support the British public. The fact that much of mainland Europe fears a European war more than anything and sees the EU as a safeguard against that gives the EU a lot more popularity points in those countries. Britain, having been on the winning side of WW2, is not part of this cultural Zeitgeist. 

The EU's approach prior to Brexit was entirely based on the idea that they could ""rise above"" British internal politics and carry on as ever and nothing bad could happen. That approach has failed disastrously for the EU (even if the material consequences will be worse for the UK). 

From the perspective of a statesman, it's not about right or wrong, digging your nails in or having the moral high ground, it's about effective or ineffective leadership. Whatever the situation, the statesman has to adapt to it and make and turn it to the advantage of the organisation they are leading. In the case of the EU in the UK, it was a failure.

*Putin's Asymmetric Assault on Democracy in Russia and Europe: Implications for US National Security - A Minority Staff Report Prepared for the use of the Committee on Foreign Relations - US Senate, 115th Congress, 2nd Session, January 10, 2018*

&gt;The Nordic states continue to raise their populations’ awareness of and resiliency to Kremlin disinformation campaigns. In advance of a military exercise in Sweden, which also included the other Nordic states, the Baltics, **and the United States**, the defense ministries of Sweden and Denmark released a joint statement announcing their intention to team up to deter Russian government cyberattacks and disinformation operations. And **Sweden, which will hold elections in 2018, has begun ramping up its defenses against disinformation operations through its Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB)**. The agency has picked up on fake news stories that push narratives claiming that Sweden is a war zone and the rape capital of Europe, and that it has banned Christmas lights and the eating of bacon on trains.624 Echoing the U.S. experts hired by Finland, the head of MSB’s global analysis and monitoring section, Mikael Tofvesson, has emphasized that the MSB’s strategy is not to fight fire with fire, noting that:

&gt;‘‘It’s like mudwrestling a pig. You’ll both get dirty, but the pig will think it’s quite nice. This plays into their hands, whereas for us getting dirty is just a pain. Instead, we have to try to stay clean and focus on the part of our society that has to work: **democracy and freedom of expression, to make sure that giving the citizens correct information becomes our best form of resistance**.’’ (page 111)

O problema com qual sempre me deparo é de definir onde a hipocrisia e o desrespeito começam. A estória dos dreadlocks é um exemplo fácil por que as origens religiosas são bem antigas e não têm conotações fortes com eventos que afetaram o mundo. 

Por exemplo, quando eu tinha dreadlocks e todos (fora um pequeno grupo de Rastas) que conheci que tinham dreads eram por razões estéticas (eu acho que dreadlocks *look very cool*) e para projetar (pelo menos para mim) uma imagem de alguém conectado à natureza e ""selvagem"". O mesmo pode ser dito para pessoas usando o [samurai] *chonmage* ou *man bun* (faz um Google porque não tenho a mínima ideia de como traduzir) e não-carecas raspando a cabeça como monques budistas.

Mas coloca um bigode e corte de cabelo do Hitler e aí o bicho pega, não importa se você simplesmente gosta daquele estilo...

E esses exemplos são fáceis. Joga aí minha anedota da discussão com um negro dos E.U.A. que acha perfeitamente normal para negros usarem dashikis, mas não para outras raças. Ele sabia de alguns nomes de países africanos mas somente podia apontar para a Africa do Sul num mapa e não tinha resposta quando perguntei se meu primo, que nasceu no Egito (minha família materna é da diaspóra Armênia e nasceram por todo canto) e é indistinguível de um Europeu mediterrâneo, tinha mais ""direito"" de usar o dashiki do que ele.

O grande problema é que certas palavras e atitudes influenciam pessoas de diferentes maneiras. Acho que meu uso de ""negão"" e ""neguinho"" foram indicativos da minha falta de sensibilidade vinda do meu meio cultural. ""Neguinho"" em particular me faz sentir mal porque é uma descrição de cor de pele usada como insulto para qualquer outra raça - a palavra junta a raça com o comportamento -. Embora o resto das minhas interações com a população negra não tinham quaisquer presunções, eu contribui para manter aquela conexão negativa... Aquilo foi tão natural e sem nenhuma malícia que estou sempre me perguntando se continuo fazendo coisas do tipo. 

Eu creio que é impossível não fazer estereótipos.  Uma das características mais provada e evidente da mente humana é que nossos cérebros estão sempre automaticamente observando, identificando e agrupando padrões (*patterns*), e fornecendo explicações para o que está sendo experienciado. O problema é quando não podemos ou queremos utrapassar esses esterótipos iniciais.

False,JeffB1517,1508496655.0,,Israel,[],,Jewish Zionist American ,dark,text,t2_hzxewvo,"Interestingly enough your position was tried before the ICJ in 2003.  At the time there were parties that argued that an occupying power in Iraq (the USA) could not declare itself sovereign and establish a government.  All it can do with withdraw.  The ICJ found for the Americans.  The literal text of occupation law  explicitly encourages occupying governments to form civilian governments in territory they occupy.  The ICJ found that the vague prohibition on conquest does not override the literal text.  International law is designed to encourage occupations ending not discouraging it by making the bar impossibly high for occupying powers.  Quite simply the ICJ does not agree with you that the Soviet withdraw from Afghanistan was an ideal to be emulated in all situations.  It far preferred how the USA handled the occupation of Germany and Japan. 

International law does not want conquest.  It also does not want legal chaos.  Your position amounts to the belief that as we move forward from WWII an entity can act like a government and exist for generation after generation after generation and not be recognized as the government  because some time in the distant past there was a conquest of that the territory.  This is precisely the logic that was denied by international law multiple times. For example the idea that once a Catholic government is established over territory any non-Catholic government is illegitimate was rejected firmly in the 17th century.  The modern equivalent that once territory has Islamic government any Christian government can never be legitimate and thus Spain is occupied has also been rejected. That argument incidentally by the UN.  More recently Serbia made that case with regard to Kosovo, that the actions of occupiers as sovereign are permanently illigitimate and again it was rejected.  

Tibet is an almost perfect comparable case to Israel.   The conquest happened in 1949.  Are the EU and the USA violating international law by recognizing China as the government of Tibet?  Is the Dalai Lama's government in exile really the government of Tibet?  

The power you are granting the United Nations in your theory of international law is effectively the power to declare all borders arbitrarily  not allowing the population of the territory nor the governments involved any appeal to UN power.  Under your read of the law the UN could declare Missouri occupied territory and the USA nor the people of Missouri would have any ability to remain in the USA.  All the USA could ever do is withdraw.  Then a Missouri government totally independent of the United States would be the only one that could at a later date agree to unify with with United States.  And of course since that would never happen Missouri would remain ""occupied"" forever.  There are people who believe the UN possess that power, there are also plenty of people who disagree. The UN itself seems quite mixed on whether it possess that power.   Mostly however on balance the UN doesn't want entities with the powers of states existing totally outside international law.  A situation where the world could have dozens of entitles perfectly capable of administering law like states, conducting wars like states that would forever exist outside international law framework because they they can never legally be states is not something the the bulk of people even within the UN seeks to create.  

Your approach of permanent non-recognition has been tried multiple times and all of them were a disaster.  No one in Europe wants to go back to a situation where kings warred on one another and could claim that XYZ even though they looked in all respects like the government was not actually the government because 3 centuries ago there was some sort of error in succession.

100% wrong. Starting in the 70s an activist organisation called CEPTIA campaigned for bans on pay toilets, leading to most states banning them and the effective collapse of the US bathroom market.

_In June, 1976, with no one left to take the reins, CEPTIA issued a news release proclaiming victory: “There are so many anti-pay toilet bills being introduced around the country that [we] can no longer keep track of all of them. CEPTIA ... wasn’t making a bid for power: its end was its own elimination.”_

So all of your other points about ""niceness"" and ""mindset"" are moot, anyway if you were really so ""nice"" you would ~~stop bombing poor countries for fun~~ not need government legislation to force people to give away bathroom services for free, they would just do it.

&gt; Very few business will think you’re an asshole for using their bathroom

Irrelevant. I am happy to pay for decent services, and I enjoy having the opportunity to pay a modest fee for a clean, high-quality bathroom. I don't need men with guns forcing people to people to give it to me for free, nor would I wish the overall reduction of quality and availability that destroying pricing mechanisms causes to a marketplace. In my country in Europe you find 1+ large, clean, high quality paid bathrooms in any mall, train station, or major highway rest stop. There is no need to have to awkwardly hunt out some obliging business who are happy to let you tramp in and out to take a shit, or go to some filthy disgusting place lacking basic necessities - we have a quality product, convenient and available to purchase basically whenever we need it.

&gt; Regurgitator are an Australian alternative rock band from Brisbane, Queensland. The band was formed in late 1993 by core members Quan Yeomans (vocals, guitar, electronics) and Ben Ely (vocals, bass, electronics). Martin Lee played drums until departing in 1999 after recording ...art and the subsequent tour. He was replaced by current drummer Peter Kostic (Front End Loader, Hard-Ons). The band also featured Seja Vogel (Sekiden, Seja) on keyboards and backing vocals from 2006 to 2010; and was featured on their album Love and Paranoia. She also accompanied them on the Retrotech tour and various one offs when suitable.   The touring band has also been supplemented by various extra players over the years the most notable being their first additional keyboardist Shane Rudken (Ponyloaf, Emporium) for a few years in the late 90s.

&gt; They have released numerous EPs and albums that they have recorded in dubiously idiosyncratic scenarios: Tu-Plang (1996) in the remote jungle outside Bangkok; the triple platinum selling Unit (1997) in a condemned Fortitude Valley warehouse as wreckers waited outside; …art (1999) in a sun soaked Byron Bay beach house lapping up the waves; Eduardo &amp; Rodriguez Wage War on T-Wrecks (2001) in the thick cigar smoke of Andy Gill’s London lounge-room; the post Warner release of Mishmash (2004) done in a glass box in Federation Square as part of the disturbing Band in a Bubble parody of reality shows and it’s way before it’s time multiple streaming media mayhem; Love and Paranoia (2007) in a bullet riddled studio in Rio de Janeiro under the looming rock arms of Corcovado; SuperHappyFunTimesFriends (2011) in their home studios over a period of 3 weeks sparked after a debate about whether what they were doing constituted an album; to their most recent and possibly final twisted piece of mangled pop culture Dirty Pop Fantasy (2013) recorded high in an Hong Kong skyscraper and then mixed on the streets of Melbourne… all of this long with their first 2 EPs (Regurgitator and New), the Olympic induced Crush the Losers, the manic EPs Bong in my Eye and Distractions… and the Warner destroying Jingles compilation (2003). 

&gt; In the past 20 or so years they have toured all over Australia, New Zealand, Japan, UK, Europe, USA, Hong Kong, China, Vietnam, Laos and other parts of Asia. Late 2009 they played a small festival in the Japanese Alps with Hoodoo Gurus… before working with dance choreographer Gavin Webber on the live music/dance/theatrical project Rock Show at QPAC in Brisbane. In 2010 they performed a highly successful live soundtrack to Japanese anime film AKIRA at Sydney Opera House. They then decided to give up the album style of approach announcing they would just release tracks… with a batch coming out under the title Distractions as they toured Australia, played festivals and took off for shows in London, Dubai and Bahrain… returning for Festival of the Sun in Port Macquarie. 2011 started in Brisbane with a huge two night flood benefit show and a massive 3 song set at the Brisbane Soccer Grand final that they won in an exciting penalty shoot out. The seventh album SuperHappyFunTimesFriends released on vinyl, cassette, download and a playable badge (playbutton) which set them off on a trajectory of touring – the sold out national Annual Sail tour with NZ guest Disasteradio - possibly their most enthusiastically received tour and release for some years. Regurgitator’s UNIT was voted #10 on the Triple J Top 100 Australian albums coincided with performances of the album “UNIT” over Falls &amp; Southbound festivals for the end of 2011. 2012 kicked off with the Big Day Out tour – their 6th time around - plus performances at the Margaret River Surf Classic, Red Deer Festival in Qld before touring seminal albums Tu Plang and Unit – The Retrotech2012 tour (with special guests from Indonesia Senyawa and China Hedgehog) was highly successful with the majority of shows sold out. Following this with the hot spot on the sold-out 2012 Meredith Music Festival. 

&gt; The past few years have seen Regurgitator do some superfluous shit. It’s all pretty interesting – the costume changes, the gimmicky record and release strategies, the full-album live sets – but tonight they achieved something far more pure. In straight power-trio formation (no spandex onesies, no heavy metal wigs), they performed what could well be the set of their careers. Hearing thousands sing along to I Will Lick Your Arsehole never gets old. They’re a punk band at heart, and one of the finest this country has produced. (Beat Magazine Dec 2012)

&gt; In April 2013 they headed out on the rural Groovin’ The Moo festival tour and released album #8 Dirty Pop Fantasy September 2013… followed with national Dirty Pop Tour with guest from Portland Wampire… ending up playing their last show for who knows how long as part of a short Asia tour in Beijing mid December 2013 with friends New Pants.

&gt; TONEDEAF: “You might not even be aware of your inner dark pop fantasies, but Regurgitator’s sensational new opus will definitely awaken them. In 2013, Gurg’s raw authenticity is still in perfect condition” 8.5/10
BEAT MAG: Dirty Pop Fantasy soaks up forty years of pop from Austin to Zurich, wringing out familiar tunes strained of cliché. They're winking at you going ""Your kiss like a Caramel Twix,  sweeter than a Kinder Surprise”. The 'Gurge’s Dirty Pop Fantasy isn't simply a label – it's their bony fists banging like a gavel, demanding your ear. The nature of their fantasy is irrepressible! 

&gt; Never ones to compromise or shy away from the unusual, the untried, or any genre that infects their creative sensibility… more than ever they find themselves extending the vitality of their live performances, continuing to infuse them with exuberance, mania and their mashedup motion of rock, punk, electro, funk, pop, where it goes vibes.

So-called ""rationalists"" typically think that we can attain true knowledge by analyzing our ideas, using logic to reason from common notions, and through mathematical explanations. ""Rationalists"" also tend to see sense perception as the main sources of error and unclarity.

""Empiricism"" is a way of categorizing a set of thinkers located primarily in Britain. So-called ""empiricists"" tend to think the opposite. Sense perception is our main source of truth, and we fall into error when we turn our sense perceptions into vague, generalized abstractions. For empiricists, we can get at the truth by being very careful about distinguishing the actual content of our sense perception from various abstractions or ""beings of reason"" that emerge through abstractions or vague language.

While its true that ""rationalist"" thinkers like Descartes, Leibniz, and Spinoza tend to think that reasoning, rather than the senses, are a true source of knowledge, and that the senses often lead us into error, and it's also true that ""empiricist"" thinkers like Locke and Hume think the opposite, it's actually quite hard to draw a clear line between them.

Although these philosophers disagreed with each other on these and many other things, they all shared a similar commitment to mechanical and experimental philosophy (even in the case of thinkers like Leibniz, who introduces final causality, yet only as overlapping upon a closed series of mechanical, efficient causes).

""Anti-trans video"" – Mostly surrounds the ""Drag Tots"" cartoon that Ru Paul produced. AJ rants that this is part of the sexualization of children plot. He then shows a video of a drag queen twerking in front of kids and a child in drag stripping off a skirt in front of a crowd. The specific element of the video that I think had YouTube pull the video was when he referred to some drag queens as hideous.  
""Child Beating Video"" – This one is short and is basically a kid who keeps pushing and hitting an adult. After about 15-20 seconds the adult pushes the kid to the ground and the kid cries hysterically. A banner then comes down saying something to the effect of this is how you deal with liberals.  
""Anti-Muslim"" – He says that globalists have overthrown Northern Africa and Europe through pushing radical Islam. He claims that the Iraq wars were meant to radicalize the area. Now he says that he is against organized Islam but doesn’t elaborate why. After that he rants about demagoguery and the stacking of demographics disproportionately towards those dependent on the govt. dole. He then covers statements from Erdogan where Erdogan states that Europeans who are hostile towards migrants will not be safe in the street. AJ then talks about specific events of violence, etc. in Europe. He claims that ads aired in Germany telling German women to adopt the hijab (i’d like to see proof of this). Following AJ is like chasing a cat but in summary he says that Islam is radical, invading Europe, and they will change the country towards the extremist viewpoints and the Europeans will be forced to follow it or be bullied.

 We have been an advocate of sustainable movie ticket subscription offerings for last 4 years, and when we look at the details of the AMC plan we fear that this will devalue the movie experience and simply is not sustainable. We think that this plan may even result in the cannibalization of AMC's own customer base.


This from unemotional analysis from stock experts:

https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/06/26/will-amc-stubs-a-list-be-a-moviepass-or-amc-killer.aspx

AMC Stubs A-List is great, but now let's go over why it may hurt AMC and actually help MoviePass. For starters, it will champion MoviePass' crusade that a movie-going experience is worth less than current retail prices. A big win for Helios and Matheson is that folks may decide to sign up for both plans -- I know I will -- and it will reduce the monthly burden of ticket prices on MoviePass. The move also naturally validates the MoviePass model, and bargain seekers wooed by AMC Stubs A-List for $19.95 may be even more smitten by MoviePass at half that price. 

AMC is going to learn a few lessons the hard way here. It's going to realize that folks tend to go for pricier tickets when it's on someone else's dime, something that it probably already knows since it collected $2.24 per movie more from MoviePass than it did from its average movie goer in its latest quarter. The difference will be even higher here, as AMC Stubs A-List members will be encouraged to go for premium shows. AMC Entertainment has naturally thought this through, but the plan could be too good for its own good. 


The way you argue one could think you are heavily invested in AMC somehow.   MoviePass has been around since 2011. They officially launched their $35/month plan in 2013. They revised it up to $40, then $50.  When MoviePass was acquired they retained the two owners/founders to run the company.  You would have thought that they have plenty of data to know what they can and can't afford.  Alas...

AMC's $20 plan for 12 movies, all potentially and likely IMAX/3D, is not sustainable.  It was never meant to be. They'll wait until MoviePass is gone, then they revert to the plan they were working on when they partnered with MoviePass in 2014 and tested a $45 per month plan in 2 markets.

https://socialnewsdaily.com/46401/amc-theaters-to-offer-monthly-pass-in-denver-boston/

and even at $45 (or $35 for a plan that takes away IMAX/3D) that was seen as unsustainable:

https://www.dailydot.com/via/amc-unlimited-movie-pass-new-netflix/

AMC might think they are making more money, but for most moviegoers, spending $35 a month on movies when they could spend as much as $60 or more assuredly seems far more of a bargain for audiences. It seems certain AMC would be losing money with this approach that seems counterintuitive to their end goal. AMC is hoping the Unlimited Movie Pass will draw in moviegoers that ordinarily wouldn’t think about going to the movies, but it might end up hurting theater chains—especially independent ones—in the process.


I would say do some research yourself.  You don't seem to know that it was MoviePass itself, in 2014, that was asked to launch a subscription service for AMC at the $45 price point for all-inclusive and $35 for 2D only.  They even test marketed the idea in two markets in 2015, Boston and Denver, with additional rollouts planned into other markets if it was successful.  It never happened.

&gt;What do you think about the Canadian news regulation

Canadians are free to govern themselves with however much government interference they want.  We were not set up with the same government as them, and they are much more socialistic than we are and are closer to European style of democracy than the US which is styled much more libertarian and individual rights.

&gt;I'm wondering why you're ignoring real problems and real dangers in our modern unregulated news environment, while justifying this lack of regulation by citing a hyperbolic and paranoid conspiracy fantasy that is literally entirely theoretical?

This isn't a black and white issue.  This would squarely put us in the camp of the government deciding which information we can disseminate.  It would be like banning Mein Kamf or other ""dangerous"" media.  This dumbs down the person where the goverment gets to decide before I do that Fox News is absolutely ridiculously hypocritical.  Their narrative is stretched so biased and morally questionable, but I still will listen to get a different point of view, and would never ever take away a person's right to hear multiple viewpoints.  To remove that right is authoritarian and allows the government to call their citizens too stupid to disseminate right from wrong (ala China).  I see this for what it is, and not some hypothetical theory.  Even the ""do no evil"" Goggle is caving to censorship in China and enacting the muzzling of the media would have us follow suit.

This sub and the show has always been my silly escape - recently even more so than before.

I feel like  I am stuck in a rut in my professional life. Job is okay enough, but I feel the bureaucracy of academia slowly killing my love and passion for science.

Last year, I received a very lucrative offer to switch over to the private sector and make serious bank. However, in a perfect mix of snobbery and naivety, I decided to take on another post-doc position instead. 'Cause, you know - academia is such a 'worthy' sector and *ethics* and *research integrity* and \*'what if I'll want to be tenured one day'...\*Plus, being a such a well published researcher (especially for my age), I thought that *'they would HAVE to respect me and treat me right'* \- Especially knowing how well I can schmooze and pull grants.... Who cares about financial benefits when I have the respect of my colleagues and independence of mind, right?!

What a load of bullshit....

Man, you ever have those moments were you wish you could reach across the time continuum to slap your former self silly?

And to add insult to my self-inflicted injury, they gave my position to a former classmate of mine, who 1) I cannot stand 2) I have to interact with regularly 3) only made it through grad school by literally fucking at least 3 of the sup profs 4) tried to get with an ex of mine the DAY AFTER we broke up 5) pretends that I was passed over in her favour(in her dreams).

Does that sound like high school? Because that's what it feels like.

Personal life is nothing to write home about either - although it's not like  I am making any efforts to change that (as my mother likes to remind me). I just can't be bothered with a half-assed relationship right now. Random dates can be so much hassle and saying that you are not really interested in anything serious has a way of attracting the absolute duds of the dating world. (A couple weeks ago I was asked whether sleeping with me would mean that they'd get to cross off the Asian AND Black girl off their hit list and what else I am mixed with - cause I am just to 'fine' to be only a mix of that.)

And of course all my exes are either getting married or having babies or are globetrotting with their GFs. Bah.

So...eugenics?

&gt;Yes, but I am proposing accomplishing raising innovation rates by differential reproduction - we do not need to mimick evolution. I am proposing to do it via embryo selection.

More eugenics?

&gt;Not at all - as long as their kids are smarter than their parents they will improve, which we can ensure.

How?

&gt;Hundreds of them. No man has principles we all just have heuristics.

What? I have lots of principles. Not everyone believes in arbitrary values.

And frankly this isn't even true for you. You've decided that human ""improvement"" is a valuable goal...this is a principle, not some fundamental goal of reality or all people.

&gt;Generally it may or may not be in the normal policy debate. but raising factor productivity by the amount mean intelligence changes do changes the conditionals in this debate- as long as people use the service it is good enough and more people will if it is publically available.

I think you are giving a bit too much credit to IQ as far as advantages go. While IQ is certainly an advantage, especially over statistical averages, it is not as ubiquitous as it would need to be for this logic to hold.

And this doesn't hold anyway, because private healthcare is better quality than public healthcare, and could potentially be less expensive, so it's entirely possible that making it ""publicly available"" would actually reduce access to it overall. Public healthcare benefits are typically based on assumptions regarding opportunity costs that are not justified.

&gt;Bu this is not about criticism, this is about running away when shit hits the fan. Will happen.

How so? I'm not sure what this means.

&gt;Nah. Being a nasty totalitarian fuck results in genocide.

This is frankly ignorant of history. These things don't start out totalitarian, but they will necessarily become that way over time. This is like saying it's not the arsenic that is dangerous, it's only people *ingesting* arsenic that results in death! I mean, sure, technically, but this doesn't make eating arsenic a good idea.

&gt;Other kind of transformative ideals were actually pretty decent. United States for example.

The ideals of the United States were not utopian. They were based on a deep understanding of human nature and was *specifically designed* to handle disagreement between people. Democracy and utopia are inherently in conflict; you cannot have both, as utopia requires agreement with the utopian ideals, and people generally have their own ideals.

&gt;Not all change is bad change but you have to be careful and non radical in pursuit - hence all my propositions are sucht that most western european coutnries could implement them without radically changing their political system or some such, just gentle reform of a few aspects.

I agree with this in general principle, I'm just not convinced IQ eugenics is a positive thing.

&gt;This would mean that right wing totalitaarian states kill just as much as left wing ones. Nope, they kill less by orders of magnitude.

Depends on what you mean by ""right wing"" and ""left wing."" These terms get very murky outside of specific political systems. That being said, if we count theocracies as ""right wing,"" they've killed a **lot** of people throughout history. But I'm not sure if this distinction is particularly useful, as you are really having more of a ""authoritarian/libertarian"" differences than a ""left/right"" one.

&gt;I do not have a movement, I just have some simple non radical policy proposals. If you dont want public health care in the US, fine do not do it. But in europe it would be easy to do.

Eugenics isn't a radical policy proposal?

&gt;Nope. Innovation of a society strongly predicts its war making capability. Why was Willhelmean Germany about as strong as the other european powers combined eve 1913?

This is actually a great example that proves *my* point. Who won WWI? Spoiler: not Germany. Despite their ""IQ advantage."" What advantage did their opponents have?

Oh, right. Numbers.

&gt;Israel has mroe patents then the rest of the middle east combined and its warfare capabilities are are also higher, despite enormous population differences.

Israel would get annihilated by the rest of the Middle East in a direct conflict with no other influences. They do have a fantastic military, in large part due to U.S. support and training, but the main reason Israel could stand up to the entire Middle East is because they are protected by the U.S. and most of Europe, and everyone knows it.

&gt;Sure, but the conservatives are winning that fight. They are not winning against the grey tribe though. Not in the long run.

Um, we've always had a ""grey tribe."" The majority of people do not hold extreme political views. Frankly, the extremes are hard to rationally support, as they require you to ignore all the good arguments from the other side. Unfortunately, as much as we *wish* there to be a single perfect system for everything, there isn't. Reality is complicated, and fixing one problem creates five others.

This is why religion and utopia are popular, despite being hard to defend rationally; they give the illusion of a ""simple"" world. But our world is not simple, no matter how much we wish it was.

&gt;It is not a hope. If my philosophy is correct, deontological societies will not be the movers and shakers in the future. Unless you have strong priors for my proposals not working you should beleive so just the same.

My priors are the precipitously dropping birth rates among modern ""relativistic"" societies, such as Japan and western Europe. Also the higher suicide rates in both. Without a sense of meaning and purpose, human beings tend to not bother with children or, in many cases, living at all. And ""do whatever you want, every choice is just as good as any other"" is not a satisfying reason to live.

Deontology, on the other hand, gives someone principles and purpose, even if it's ultimately self-determined. As such it will always have appeal, likely for many of the same reasons religion is not going to die out.

&gt;My endstate is that some societies follow my prefered policies and they produce enough smart people to turn the world around.

There's a built-in assumption here that is *not* justified...smart people will turn the world around. There is no guarantee they will agree with your policy. I'm in the higher percentiles of IQ and I sure don't, for example.

The other assumption is that the world needs to be turned ""around."" What direction is that? I think our world has been steadily improving over time, and there's a lot of evidence this is the case. Poverty worldwide has [dropped precipitously](https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty) over time. Which way should we turn ""around?"" To a world with *more* extreme poverty?

Just as you (correctly) pointed out, not all change is bad. But the counterfactual is also true...not all change is *good*, either.

False,av4rice,1232677498.0,,instagram,[],,https://instagram.com/shotwhorephotography/,dark,text,t2_3cuz2,"&gt; Is shutter speed up to my finger or could it be automatically? 

It's only up to your finger in Bulb exposure mode. Otherwise the exposure usually changes pretty drastically based on small differences in fractions of a second so you need the camera to time that for you. To dictate the shutter speed and have the camera automatically determine the rest of the exposure, use Shutter Priority mode described on pages 76-77, and Auto ISO on pages 60-61 of [your manual](http://files.canon-europe.com/files/soft33601/manual/eos500d_en_flat.pdf). Or to set everything manually, including shutter speed, manual mode is on page 81.

Since a shorter exposure time (faster shutter speed) means less time for light to hit the sensor each frame, it's going to reduce your exposure brightness. You'll want your other exposure settings to compensate for that (camera will try to do that automatically in Shutter Priority mode) and they have their own limits as well so ideally you want plenty of light on scene.

&gt; Last week, when I try to take several photos at a time making sure one of them gets perfect exposure, my camera stopped working and says ""busy"" on the screen, is it a technical problem? 

It's a technical limitation. Image data from the photos you shoot first gets stored in temporary memory called the buffer. Then it gets written from the buffer to the memory card. The buffer operates very quickly and can keep up with your maximum continuous shooting rate, but it's also limited in size. The memory card has a much larger size but operates much slower. Once the buffer fills (after about 9 photos if you're shooting in raw), there's no place for new photos to go, so the camera has to slow down while it clears the buffer by moving photos one by one to the memory card. Depending on your memory card write speed, the rate has to slow down to something around 1 photo per second.

If you shoot in jpeg instead of raw, the files are much smaller so your buffer won't fill until 170 photos. But then you have less available data, quality, and editing latitude with each photo. Otherwise if you need a larger buffer, you need a better camera. That will increase the number of photos you can shoot at maximum framerate before dropping to the card write rate.

A faster memory card (in terms of write speed) may increase the rate at which you can shoot after the buffer is full, but it's still going to be relatively slower. And your camera will also bottleneck that, because it can only write so fast. I'm not sure the point at which faster cards have no further effect for that camera.

&gt; Cameras have a minimum distance with objects &amp; closer than that, it basically stops working 

Minimum focusing distance is a property of the lens, not the camera.

&gt; I never succeeded in taking close-ups with tiny objects. Is it adjustable or do I have to buy a more expensive lens? 

You need a lens with a closer minimum focusing distance. For macro in particular you're ideally looking for a high magnification factor or reproduction ratio. Or, for cheaper, you can use extension tubes, close-up filters, or reversing rings to focus closer with a lens you already have: [https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/wiki/index#wiki\_how\_can\_i\_shoot\_cheap\_macro.3F](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/wiki/index#wiki_how_can_i_shoot_cheap_macro.3F)",True,False,False,,0,1533318714,,False,0,e3jrsa1,False,t3_93nykm,True,t1_e3iqfme,/r/photography/comments/93nykm/official_question_thread_ask_rphotography/e3jrsa1/,,1537044053,2,True,False,photography,t5_2qh2a,r/photography,public,

False,JerrathBestMMO,1523018962.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_15handow,"I feel almost flattered for you to think that my opinion matters in that case because that is still such a hotly debated question.

With regards to Mongols, I can give you quite the definitive: impossible to say.

We have no idea how heavy Mongol bows were. It's a ridiculous tragedy. We got some very good evidence from archaeological finds of Turkic bows, and we have some textual evidence from Chinese bows with regards to draw weights but you can't really compare them to the bows that the Mongols used on horseback.

Until recently, let's say 10 years? There was still debate over the draw weights of the English warbows  used in the 100 Years War (when its use was at its peak). 

We have a pretty good idea now because of over a hundred bows which were found in a sunken ship from a time not too long after thr 100 Years War.

We got a lot of data and most of it rather bad of penetration tests. Usually some time of bow against some time of armor. Flawed tests in many ways, non-historical bows and arrows, or bows which were too weak, arrows that were too light. Badly made armor, wrong metal properties, no padding, too static of a frame.

A very good place to look for original testing to the greatest rigor is the underappreciated blog of Mark Stretton (bowyer and current record holder for strongest bow shot, 200 lbs).

He has tests on plate, too  and tests which vary quite a few things.

My favorite test he did is of armor on a zipline to emulate an incoming charge. That shows how many arrows you can loose during the time they charge while remaining somewhat accurate and whether the charge speed of the enemy adds to the impact.

But he hasn't and won't ever be able to jump on a horse and shoot a bow like the Mongols did. He can't make bows like the Mongols made (very few can...maybe he dabbled. I'm guessing he doesn't know). And he can't shoot any bow of sufficient weight while charging.

Even horsearchery legends like [Lajos Kassai](https://youtu.be/InWW_uhX_Ts) just use light bows.

Distance is a crucial component, too. 

Assuming immediate distance, high draw weight bows, bows as highly performing as some horse archer replicas, hardened arrow tip, heavy arrows... that's a recipe for penetration. Look at the results [Mark Stretton was getting](http://markstretton.blogspot.com/?m=1) and consider that a Mongol bow could potentially be  more deadly.

One question that is easier to answer is with regards to crossbows because the physics have been known for a long time and we now got good replica makers who empirically confirm the math. 

With European crossbows, you got inefficient bow limb design, the inefficient properties of steel and the short power stroke (how much the string travels backwards for loading). These combine to make a 900 lbs Medieval crossbow about as powerful as an average English Longbow of 140 lbs. 

Crossbows don't receive as much attention as bows, from me included. They can be scaled up to monstrous draw weights but we don't know how common these were and in what situations. I think that and their price is why people find more interest in bows.

If you are interested in learning about the differences between crossbows and bows, you can   check out [this video by Tod](https://youtu.be/TdB470lo6nM). He knows a lot about crossbow and how they are made (he makes them professionally). The whole crossbow stuff is impenetrable really. There is one book that is like 150 years old and that is basically all that your average historical archery enthusiast would know about. Tod and the crossbow community has been generating some new knowledge but they don't publish journal articles and write books unlike the bow building community.

I'm 28, been a fan since I was 6yo, my first SW film was Empire special edition and I've enjoyed a lot of what the EU brought to the table until very recently. Knights of the Old Republic, the Thrawn Trilogy, a lot of what happened with the Yuuzhan Vong, the stories about the solo children (except Chewie dying and the ridiculous amount of kidnapping), everything Rogue Squadron (because Wedge Antilles is GOAT), Shadows of the Empire, Jedi Academy. 

Anyway, what I'm saying is that I feel a lot of love for a lot of the material now labeled Legends but I'm also comfortable with the decision to make that not Canon and focus on what was on the highest level of Canon for Lucas, meaning the films and TCW.

Because of that, we've gotten plenty of quality material in the form of movies (Rogue One is a fan favorite, Solo has been praised for being fun instead of grim and I personally love TLJ), books (Lost Stars, Bloodlines, Leia: Princess of Alderaan, From a Certain point of View, Dark Disciple, Phasma, Tarkin, Thrawn), comics (Vader, Dr Aphra, Poe Dameron, Kanan, Han Solo, Lando) and animated shows (Rebels was amazing and Resistance is on its way).

In the 5 years since the franchise was sold to Disney, we've seen a ridiculous amount of content for pretty much any taste and age and I think that's just fantastic. Sure, I think they seriously need to up their game on the games department, I was personally really mad with the Battlefront 2 fiasco but otherwise, I'm really happy with what we've gotten and what's to come.

Super hyped for Rian's trilogy, the movie series by Weiss and Benioff, Jon Favreau's live action series, not to mention Episode IX.

Can't wait to go to Galaxy's Edge when it opens and that's comming from someone that has never been too much of a Disney or Disney world fan. I mean, we're talking about an actual Star Wars theme park here!

Who else If not Disney would be able to manage so much in so little time and with that level of quality? Not just that but to leave Lucasfilm work independently is simply what I love the most of all of this. Creative people coming from everywhere and being commissioned for material that explores new corners of the Galaxy Far Far Away is super exciting.

Finally, and this is mostly personal, it means everything that was super ridiculous is gone. Emperor's Clones? Gone. Vitiate? Gone. Triclops? Gone for good. The courtship of princess Leia? Gone and the world is a better place because of that. Crystal Star? Gone and the Galaxy thanks Disney for it.

&gt; Assessing the cost of non-EU - i.e. the trade-related gains from the Single Market or the long-run cost of its break-up - implies an evaluation of what proportion of actual trade is caused by the institutional arrangements currently in place.

&gt; Despite weaker data, we also find that the EU increases trade in services beyond what regular RTAs provide, albeit with an effect half as strong as that on trade in goods.

&gt; As an illustration, when French exporters get enhanced access to German markets, German consumers will likely consume more French goods but less US goods, so that preferential trade policies generate both trade creation and trade diversion effects.

Entendi. Faz sentido sim. Mas é que ainda me parece muito estranho... Eu entendo que é bom eu poder escolher entre netflix, amazon e hulu independente da operadora. Mas ao mesmo tempo eu acho ótimo eu não perder franquia pra ver netflix, caso eu tenha escolhido netflix. hahahahha

Tipo, vou tentar esmiuçar pra mostrar pq que pra mim tá complicado de entender:

Situação A:

Marco civil bombando. Todas operadoras tão cobrando franquia pra eu ver tanto netflix, quanto amazon, quanto hulu.

Situação B:

Não tão respeitando o marco civil. Todas operadoras não tão cobrando franquia pra netflix, mas estão pra amazon prime e pra hulu.

Situação C:

Não tão respeitando o marco civil. Uma operadora não cobra franquia pra ver netflix, outra não cobra pra ver amazon, outra não cobra pra ver hulu e outra cobra pra ver todos.

Situação D

Não tão respeitando o marco civil. Uma operadora não cobra franquia pra ver netflix, todas outras cobram franquia em todos serviços de streaming.

A situação ""A"" me parece ser a pior sempre. E o motivo é simples: em todas as outras a pior situação que eu posso ter é exatamente o que é apresentado na ""A"". 

Na B, se eu gosto de netflix eu vou ter vantagem, se eu não gosto e prefiro amazon prime, vou ter que gastar franquia - exatamente como gastaria em ""A"". 

Na C, se meu serviço de streaming é a coisa mais importante pra mim, eu posso escolher qual é a operadora que não vai me cobrar franquia nele! Se ele não é tão especial pra mim, eu posso ficar com minha operadora mesmo ela não dando franquia liberada pro meu serviço de streaming favorito e mais uma vez eu voltei à situação ""A"".

E na D a lógica se repete.

Sorry that I'm going totally off-topic from SLF, but do US schools (i'm guessing that you don't mean college or university) really begin the academic year at the start of August?

I just find that so incredible.

I'm British; my daughter, who lives with my ex-wife, finished her school year on July 20th and will start her next year (the British equivalent of US 6th Grade) on September 5th.

Do US schools really start during the hottest month of the year?  In most of Europe, all the schools are on holiday during August and that is the most expensive time to book a holiday.

Although I have noticed some US holiday places catering largely to families do offer some sort of discount in late August, which always surprised me as that is the prime family holiday period in Europe.

Lastly the US ""mass shootings"" are mostly gang violence and France is actually the world's leader in mass shootings.

Some people are good leaders, some people are good advisers, and the Venn diagram of those people has only a little bit of overlap. During war, a leader needs to convey confidence, competence and strength in order to lead. They need to make decisions and stick with them and to try to suppress widespread dissent or fracture in order to maintain overall cohesion among their faction. Advisers aren't under the same obligations, so they can play a more methodical game. They can listen to their doubts, and explore alternatives, and even lead in lesser situations, but their outlook is often fundamentally incompatible with successful war leadership.

An interesting thing about this dynamic is the very qualities that make an adviser good also allow them to identify their weaknesses when it comes to leading. This is why I think he would decline overall leadership. He knows on a fundamental level that he will be doing the most good trying to work behind the scenes to curb the worst tendencies of a despot like Sylvanas. His leadership may lead to a more honorable Horde, but that may be at the cost of any advantage the Horde may have in war.

Think Neville Chamberlain versus Winston Churchill before and during World War 2. There was nothing fundamentally wrong with Chamberlain's approach considering his goal of avoiding and curtailing war casualties, but it ended up only weakening his country's position in Europe, costing more lives.

Israel's come up with creative ways to deal with it, basically paying people to go home, because they recognize that people come mostly for economic opportunities, which touches on what I mean about anxiety

When I say anxiety, I don't mean that it is not true that people from the developing world are moving to the Western world, only that those patterns are not some conspiracy to end the existence of white people. So the anxiety comes in where people are afraid that these patterns of movement will change their way of life. 

People go where the opportunities for wellbeing are. Take the UK and India for example. It's not surprising that after centuries of coopting the south Asian economy for its own benefit lots of Indians and Pakistanis have moved to the UK.

In terms of 'maintaining whatever' as it relates to the right of movement, I'm talking about people maintaining their traditions and culture.

Speaking from an American perspective, white people should be allowed to maintain their own traditions, and culture, just like any other culture group. White Americans, are a large and diverse group, even within themselves, with an interesting history of combining various nationalities that did not necessarily get along in Europe to be one people to some degree.

Shunned by countries which organized a network of illegal torture prisons in EU I presume?

&gt; its military aggression

Here we go again. Which period you prefer - entire post WW2 or just post 1991?

&gt;  its cyber war and interference with the democratic processes

So just like US in regard to every single presidential/parliament  election in Russia?

Are you familiar with Nuland’s “Fuck EU” story?

&gt;  and its inability to be a part of a more harmonious and peaceful world order.

So Russia doesn’t bend over when US and EU supports violent coup on its border in attempts to drag Ukraine into NATO and force Russian navy base out of it. Or places bunch of hardened VLS across Europe. Is that what you mean?

&gt; Russia deserves to be a pariah, economically sanctioned and its aggressive stances towards its neighbors should be met with force.

In that case we all gonna die.

Not dragging its neighbors into NATO, not installing missiles on its borders and not throwing democratically elected governments out worked pretty well too IMO.

He was also the only Founding Father, so far as I recall, to have met the King.

John Adams's address to the King:

&gt;I think myself more fortunate than all my fellow-citizens, in having the distinguished honor to be the first to stand in your Majesty's presence in a diplomatic character; and I shall esteem myself the happiest of men if I can be instrumental in recommendingy country more and more to your Majesty's royal benevolence, and of restoring an entire esteem, confidence, and affection, or, in better words, the old good nature and old good humor between people who, though separated by an ocean and under different governments, have the same language, a similar religion, and kindred blood. I beg your Majesty's permission to add that although I have some time before been entrusted by my country, it was never in my whole life in a manner so agreeable to myself.

The King replied (""with more tremor than I had spoken with"" Adams said):

&gt;The circumstances of this audience are so extraordinary, the language you have now held is so extremely proper, and the feelings you have discovered so justly adapted to the occasion, that I must say that I not only receive with pleasure the assurance of the friendly dispositions of the United States, but that I am very glad that the choice has fallen upon you to be their minister. I wish you, sir, to believe, and that it be understood in America, that I have done nothing in the late contest but what I thought myself indispensibly bound to do by the duty which I owed to my people. I will be very frank with you, I was the last to consent to separation; but the separation having been made, and having become inevitable, I have always said, as I say now, that I would be the first to meet the friendship of the United States as an independent power.

In the 1920s, at height of Association Football's early popularity in the US, American sides routinely competed well against their European counterparts in friendlies, and the US made the semis in the inaugural FIFA World Cup. American sides, spared from much of the devastation to the young male population Europe had suffered in WWI, had a large talent pool at the time to recruit from and general interest in sports as a pastime in America was at a peak, bouyed by the strong economy. However in the late 20s the topflight league and the national sanctioning body had a schism, resulting in two leagues competing for talent and fan interest just before the great depression hit. With fan interest split and the quality of play being negatively affected, the depression eventually caused both organizations to fold.


Meanwhile, Baseball had been one of the first sports to professionalize in the 19th century, allowing it to become ""America's National Pastime"" as high quality play drew fan interest in the sport early on. Its cultural status allowed teams to stay solvent through the depression and attract top athletic talent.

At the same time, Basketball eventually took the role of ""working class sport anyone can pickup and play"" that Association Football takes in much of the rest of the world, especially in cities, largely in part to the growth of organizations like the YMCA that promoted indoor basktball courts to urban dwellers looking to stay fit, especially in the larger, but ultimately colder, northern cities like New York, Boston and Chicago. Much as football only requires posts to act as a goal, a space and a ball, basketball requires even less space, a hoop can be easily improvised when one isn't already available, giving the game incredible reach.

American Football on the other hand was an institution that had the backing of wealthy, prestigious universities, keeping interest alive through the depression, especially among the middle and upper class. With strong existing funding for the sport from up top to get things started, the gridiron game was able to grow into the financial juggernaut it has become today with the rise of television.

However, soccer is growing in popularity in the US with both the growing Hispanic population and generally higher interest among younger people. The internet has allowed International superstars like Neymar, Messi and Ronaldo to become commonly known, if not exactly household names, and more children are taking up the beautiful game as their first sport, especially as the issues with concussions in American Football are becoming better known. Immigrants and their children are driving US interest not only in the leagues from their country of origin, but also their local MLS and USL sides.

Soccer is especially becoming popular among girls thanks in large part to the  performance of the US Women's Soccer Team (who, as you may know, are the current reigning world champion). This is largely due to title IX protection that guarantees funding for women's athletics at the high school and college levels in a way not seen in most other countries around the world. The US also supports a professional Women's league in the NWSL that, while nowhere near the size of the juggernauts of the men's competitions worldwide or even in the US, nonetheless is still one of the most prominent women's professional leagues worldwide. 


As an aside, interestingly enough, prior to the civil war, Cricket was the most popular sport in the US, and the first ever International Cricket match was played between the US and Canada, predating the famous England vs Australia rivalry by some 30 odd years.

False,DiabolikDownUnder,1518422672.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_wnj7la6,"&gt;Secondly, it seems to me that you argue (and Matt too) as someone who has talked to many bible fundamentalists, which gave you certain impressions about Christians and believers. So I would like to share some background; I went to a Catholic elementary in central Europe where many of my teachers were priests and nuns, had theology classes at least every week until I was 14 and attended church regularly as well. I have stopped since then, but during that time I have always been taught that the Bible should not be taken word by word as it is, because that would be wrong and quite dumb. So there is my bias and there is yours. When you look at Peterson, at the core you see a delusional fundamentalist who desperately tries to make sense of one book at all costs, while I see a pretty normal guy trying to translate old values to accomodate modern standards.

I don't see Peterson as a fundamentalist but I do see him doing the same mental gymnastics most Christians do to explain the more problematic elements of the Bible. I can't speak to your experience not being taught to take the Bible word for word but certainly Peterson has made very clear he doesn't really seek to question any of the book's content. A very good critic of Peterson's on the YouTube channel Venaloid [included a clip of Peterson](https://youtu.be/R-m2ZuVCXgM?t=7m33s) in which Jordan basically said that any attempt to construct a different system of morality to the Bible would ultimately end in the same moral relativism he thinks led to the atrocities under atheists like Stalin and Hitler - the implication being that we shouldn't therefore stray from the morality laid out in the Bible. While the official audio of the first debate of his tour with Sam Harris hasn't been released yet, [a commenter](https://www.reddit.com/r/samharris/comments/8tf3m5/10_minutes_left/e179msa) who was at the event said that Peterson refused to concede that awful passages in the Bible, such as those condoning slavery or the stoning of those who've had sex before their wedding night, could be removed to make it a better moral work. No matter what you were taught about the Bible, Peterson certainly doesn't seem fond of people straying from any of it.

&gt;By the lightbulb example I did not mean that all the glasses would come from the Bible, quite the opposite, they are from modern philosophy, social sciences, and psychology as well. You can maybe say that he cherry picked, but A., it is a lot of material, and it was only his side project and B., on some level everyone is guilty of comfirmation bias. And many of those modern Western philosophies that you claim to be superior are actually rooted in Judeo-Christian values that the Bible collects. I meant to demonstrate that being a sceptic is easier than actually trying to combine various fields of thoughts into a single sensible narrative. And I did not find the alternative presented to be compelling as I will argue. So when you evaluate who did a better job objectively, you have to consider who did the more difficult one. I still wouldn't pick JP as the winner of this debate (not that it was about winning in the first place), but based on what I have seen from him so far, he underperformed.

But he and Dillahunty were exclusively debating Christianity, not any of these other 'shards of glass' you seem to associate with these ideas from ""modern philosophy, social sciences and psychology"". Dillahunty certainly thought Peterson was just discussing the moral superiority of a belief in God, so to suggest that by Dillahunty saying Christianity wasn't useful anymore that somehow he was also denying that Jung or Nietzsche for example were useful either is a strawman.

&gt;Regarding the morality of the Bible, you are partly right, it is somewhat all over the place and can be self contradictory even, and obviously were picked up from other places as well. But what we can see from the Bible clearly, is moral progression. The willingness to challenge our dogmas and when the morals don't make sense anymore, make sacrifices to replace them. Jesus' sacrifice is also a symbolic sacrifice of certain older dogmas. That was incredibly progressive at that time. So when MD claims that religion is so dogmatic that it cannot develop itself, he is simply ignoring the source material. And we see this progression in many controversial subjects:

It's such a stretch to say that Jesus' sacrifice somehow makes Christian culture more open to progress or the challenging of dogmas than any other religion. It's a basically unfalsifiable point. Your claim earlier about Western philosophers being influenced by 'Judeo-Christian values' is a similarly unfalsifiable point, but the the progress made in the Renaissance was inspired by pre-Christian Greece (which was full of philosophers who rebelled against established order) and the Enlightenment which was very secular doesn't lend much credence to this interpretation.

Your defences for the Bible's views on slavery, homosexuality and women's rights are the same mental gymnastics I've seen from Christians throughout my life. Of course things like keeping slaves and fearing homosexuals existed before the Bible, but the fact that thousands of years later Peterson is asking us to treat a book that still contains the values of this archaic era as the ultimate source of moral wisdom is ridiculous. The fact that the Bible expects 'self-sacrifice' from the husband does not in any way counter the fact it explicitly and repeatedly makes clear it considers the woman to be lesser to the man in a marriage. I certainly have no idea where your notion that having the Holy Spirit inside us somehow makes it Christian to question God or even to be a fucking *atheist* comes from.

&gt;So so far, this is not even really JPs Christian agnostic moral system, and not even the debate itself, it is just Christian canon as it is, already falsifying what MD has been claiming about it. And Peterson actually goes way beyond this, and he completely agrees with MD in that we cannot base our whole value system on just one book. He might say that if we absolutely had to choose one, it should be the Bible, but that is another question.

You're going to have to work a lot harder and somehow refute the works of every atheist intellectual in order to prove Dillahunty's criticism of the Bible as a moral code was false here. I don't think Peterson would say we don't need any books beyond the Bible either but he'd definitely say it should be our foundation for everything, seeing as he believes our civilisation is predicated on it. Dillahunty and I would highly disagree with this too.

&gt;So instead of arguing about the existence of God (since it cannot be proven or disproven), lets jump onto why do we need God? Do we need God? So far we can confidently say that there has been an overwhelming consensus in human societies that we need some higher order being. So what is your justification of abolishing the concept completely?

This is the same naturalistic fallacy Peterson uses. Just because a supernatural religious morality has been present throughout human history doesn't make this a good thing. I reiterate my reference to the UN World Happiness reports before which have consistently ranked secular countries as being the very happiest for the past decade as evidence that a liveable society doesn't need any kind of religion to survive contently. So no, we don't need a God.

&gt;Also, would you agree with the statement that we should accept something as truth if it is scientifically measurable, testable and demonstratable?

You're invoking one of Peterson's weakest arguments by far here. Yes I believe in accepting a realist interpretation of truth. I refer you to the Venaloid channel again for [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63dGW7UYwok&amp;t=134s) explaining why Peterson's non-realist pragmatic definition of truth can't work at all.

&gt;Finally, JP has been pretty successful and highly demanded in his projects so far, and manages them well, was an accomplished academic before all this shitstorm began so are you sure it's not envy talking when you call him a pseudo-intellectual? What in your view makes someone an intellectual to begin with? Not touching other fields?

He was an academic in a very specific field of clinical psychology. If you look at the scientific studies he's actually got his name on you'll find they have very little to do with any of the subjects he speaks about as a celebrity 'intellectual' now. He dealt primarily with alcohol addition. Whenever he's ventured out of this field into religion, philosophy, law, politics, history, art criticism and basically anything else he's clearly spoken with very little authority or insight into these disciplines. I'm not saying he couldn't be an expert on these topics as well (again an intellectual like Noam Chomsky does this), but Peterson's a pseudointellectual in my eyes because he sucks at all of them.
