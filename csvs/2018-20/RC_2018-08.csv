And while the [EU is not perfect](https://theconversation.com/how-democratic-is-the-european-union-59419) it [provides value for people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union). 

Calling it a democratic deficit seems an understatement. 

While, Sure, it has some value, for instance, As a Norwegian i just last month enjoyed not needing my passport when driving to visit Sweden.

But at the EU grows, the corruption will grow with it, and there is no democratic way to counter that corruption, because the demos has no power over who writes the laws. And as pre-revolutionary France learned so painfully. What good is having representation in parlament, when only the king can propose laws?

The EU has also done a lot of harm, Take German coal. Because of EU rules, at a point through the year, German power plants are forced to stop using German coal, because German coal is so clean and efficient, using it is seen as unfair to other coal producing countries like Poland and Greece. So Germans are forced to stop using the coal they have on storage right next to the power plants, and spend a fortune transporting even more expensive coal all the way from Greece. 

That is just one example of the insane government bureaucracy that is the EU. [and it is getting worse. ](https://www.ft.com/content/658bd8e0-c91d-11e5-be0b-b7ece4e953a0)

More than once the EU commission, the only ones who can actually propose laws, [has been deemed so corrupt, the entire commission was forced to resign. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santer_Commission) And mind you, the Parlament wanted to make what they did a crime, but because said corrupt commission refused to write a law banning their blatant corruption, nothing will **ever** happen. As opposed to the US, where you could simply vote on a senator who would propose that bill, and then have the people vote out anyone who voted no. 

The EU does not just suffer from a democratic deficit, it is fundamentally undemocratic.

&gt;And while I'm in favor of the EU, I'm not advocating for it as a model for anything in America. Except to say that Trump is [definitely anti-EU](https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:eco,w_634/https://inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/farage-1.jpg) and therefore against internationalism and more in [favor of closing borders.](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/05/politics/donald-trump-border-wall-close-country-remark/index.html)

* [**Young Adult Psychological Outcome After Puberty Suppression and Gender Reassignment**](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958). A clinical protocol of a multidisciplinary team with mental health professionals, physicians, and surgeons, including puberty suppression, followed by cross-sex hormones and gender reassignment surgery, provides trans youth the opportunity to develop into well-functioning young adults. All showed significant improvement in their psychological health, and they had notably lower rates of internalizing psychopathology than previously reported among trans children living as their natal sex. **Well-being was similar to or better than same-age young adults from the general population.**

* The only disorders more common among trans people are those associated with abuse and discrimination - mainly anxiety and depression. Early transition [**virtually eliminates these higher rates of depression and low self-worth**](http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567%2816%2931941-4/fulltext), and [**dramatically improves trans youth's mental health**](https://thinkprogress.org/allowing-transgender-youth-to-transition-improves-their-mental-health-study-finds-dd6096523375#.pqspdcee0).

The Heir to the Empire trilogy reignited the EU in the 90s and because of the state of the galaxy post-ROTJ, a lot of the major stories had to be about our heroes “governing well” and the challenges that come with that. Imo these types of stories naturally gravitate more towards sci-fi and technical explanations than fantasy and space opera. After the 90s, we had the prequels, which had the same general setting. Our heroes are governing and the challenges that come with that are what a lot of the PT era EU is about. It makes sense. Its not a dark age of lost knowledge. It’s the Jedi at the height of their power (PT era) and the Jedi rebuilt into a formidable power (post-ROTJ Legends material).


The ST was a bit of a soft reboot to ANH Galactic status quo of Rebels vs Empire, complete with our heroes NOT governing, and a lost and forgotten Jedi order. So naturally, once the decision to make the ST a soft reboot (politically) was finalized, it makes sense that it would hew a lot more closely to the mystical fantasy/space opera than sci-fi.


That said, if Episodes 10-12 do ever happen, I doubt many people (myself included) would let slide a SECOND soft reboot back to Rebels vs Empire. 10-12 should be about our heroes governing, and that may make things a bit more like Star Trek, which I’m not totally opposed to.

The general instability of a number of countries in Latin America was an awkward problem, with several of them having recently gone through revolution, if not then caught in the middle of civil war themselves. Venezuela, Colombia, and Bolivia were all in the midst of political instability, with governments elevated by coup or revolution, and while having no desire to alienate them, for the US to recognize them might give unintended moral aid to the Confederacy. The biggest example is in Caracas. When the American Consul Henry T. Blow, arrived in Venezuela in November 1861, as instructed he declined to present his credentials to Gen. Paez, who recently had overthrown the legally elected President, but did his best to maintain good social relations. A year later, his replacement, Erastus D. Culver, however had no instructions and chose to recognize the Paez government, which forced Seward to repudiate his actions in a tip-toeing communication about the United States not 'intervening in domestic disputes', and creating a fairly tense situation between the Consul and the government, only finally resolved after a peace treaty, and eventual new constitution, was signed in 1864, allowing credentials to be (again) presented with Washington's blessing.

To be sure, some, at least, saw opportunities in Union weakness. Francisco Solano López, the dictator of Paraguay, for instance, put out feelers to France in 1862 about the possibility of French support for himself to be crowned, although this came to nothing when he in turn learned that French plans might be for monarchy, but most certainly excluded him. Likewise in Ecuador, Catholic Monarchists led by recently elevated President Gabriel García Moreno, had already been plotting with France since 1859, seeking a possible French protectorate over the country, and likely continued to do so through 1862, seeing their assistance as a necessary bulwark against the Liberals.

And further, while they might have been in the minority, and it is clear enough that practical concerns gave most of Latin America little reason for anything other than support of the Union, it can't be said that the support was *immediate*. In the first phase of the war, much of the press in South America was in fact not pro-Union, as the papers were heavily dependent on British/French dispatches, which were often quite sympathetic to the Confederacy. Both driven by popular Liberal sentiment, as well as the very real threats materializing from Spanish and French actions, news coverage would shift, and by 1863, was decidedly more pro-Union. Commendatory celebrations of the 4th of July appeared in a number of papers - unimaginable several years earlier - and further, the national bands of Argentina and Chile both performed outside the American embassies as well.

In final evaluation, it is likely that based on pure sentiment, Latin America would have, for the most part, found themselves more favorable towards the Union than the Confederacy. The traditions of Republicanism and Liberalism predisposed them towards the United States and its cause of Union, while strong anti-slavery sentiment additionally ensured support the cause of abolition, even prior to its establishment as a principle aim of the war. Nevertheless, the European powers, principally Spain and France, all but ensured that they would see no other choice but to root for American success, and following that, the resumption of American protection. Preexisting resentments were not entirely erased, to be sure, but no stronger case could be made for the *value* of a strong United States and the Monroe Doctrine than the brief view of just what it meant to lack those.

Why? Wikipedia distributes and ""consumes"" knowledge on a world-wide scale, without charging quid-pro-quo fees.

I'm challenging Adam Smith's assertion at the beginning of The Wealth of Nations that if Farmer A has a surplus of something Farmer B does not want to trade his goods for, there can be no exchange until you create a currency.

Why can't Farmer B give his surplus as Farmer A asks? That is what the Fed does for banks, supplying liquidity on demand without loss because they have an unlimited surplus and no personal profit motive. The Fed and the Board of Governors are working in the public interest ...

&gt; Are you arguing that large-scale trade is somehow bad?

I'm saying it can occur without money, or with unlimited money (as now, because finance allows unlimited funding sources). Best would be for individual to trade much as you and I are right now exchanging ideas, with no currency changing hands between us.

&gt; Wampum had some currency-like properties even before the Europeans arrived and it became more of a currency later.

I think you are imposing an interpretation on pre-settler Wampum. So am I, but why should your story be better than mine? I try to get away in nature, immerse myself in it as the native Americans of this region must have done, and the ability to live without thinking of costs is invigorating.

&gt; that doesn't mean that the precursor to money isn't there.

It doesn't mean it is there, either. A mountain stream is always on, no currency is needed to drink from it. You don't have to trade or labor under a boss for money to buy food, you get it yourself or others give it to you.

&gt; As outsiders, we might look at a small-scale society and fail to see explicit quid-pro-quo exchanges, but that doesn't mean that the underlying quid-pro-quo isn't implicitly there.

You are telling stories. I'm telling a different story. Why should I believe your story?

&gt; Small scale societies often have rituals for abandoning/sacrificing people who are not able to contribute to the good of the tribe.

You fail to account for the Jains, for whom self-starvation is the best death possible.

It all started with Ansel Keys. he was wrong. See Sources section. 


They can only ever show association, not causation. And they can't differentiate between people who eat low carb/high fat but live clean lives vs people who eat high fat/high carb and who smoke, drink, etc. 


Fat is incredibly important to the human body. You can live without carbs. You cannot live without fat. 

In general, vegans take pretty good care of themselves. The same cannot be said for the majority of people who eat a lot of saturated fat. 

But when you replace carbs with fat, what you're doing is swapping one energy source for another. You're using a different metabolic pathway (ketone bodies). There is no evidence that saturated fat is harmful in this context. 

And for most people, dietary cholesterol does not equal high cholesterol in the blood. 

BTW, cholesterol is extremely important for a number of reasons. Low cholesterol is *not* a good thing, and it can cause heart failure. The french have the highest average cholesterol in Europe, around 250, but the lowest incidence of heart disease. 

------

The vegan diet can be healthy *if* the person understands that they are likely to run into at least a few nutritional deficiencies down the road and plans accordingly. Now, to me, that doesn't sound like a good diet, but that's just me. B12, V2, Omega fatty oils, calcium etc can all become issues.

&gt; Silversun Pickups is a Grammy-nominated American indie rock band which formed in Los Angeles, California, United States in 2005. The band consists of Brian Aubert (vocals, guitar), Nikki Monninger (bass, vocals), Joe Lester (keyboards) and Christopher Guanlao (drums).  The band members are friends who had played together previously or in mutual friends' bands. 

&gt; The name Silversun Pickups refers to a liquor store across the road L.A. rock-scene hang Silverlake Lounge. One of the band’s friends would often arrive at the store late at night to buy liquor, and would be as such making the ""Silversun Pickup"". 

&gt; The band is signed to Dangerbird Records. They released their debut EP ""Pikul"" in July of 2005. The band has released four albums,  2006's ""Carnavas"", 2009's ""Swoon"", 2012's ""Neck of the Woods"" and 2015's ""Better Nature"". The band managed two Top 10 singles on Billboard's Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart in 2007: ""Lazy Eye"" (#5) and ""Well Thought Out Twinkles"" (#9). In 2009, they managed their third top 10 on the chart, ""Panic Switch"" (#1)  and a fourth song ""Substitution"" was also on that chart (#23).

&gt; Silversun Pickups have been compared to The Smashing Pumpkins (possibly due in part to Brian Aubert's vocal style) and 90's shoegazing bands like My Bloody Valentine, Lush, Ride, and Slowdive. Silversun Pickups claim they have been heavily influenced by Modest Mouse and The Velvet Underground as well as other lesser-known acts.

&gt; Their first break came when a friend mailed a boombox demo to CMJ and they were accepted. They got their start in many of the most important L.A. clubs and began to draw a strong following upon the release of the Pikul EP. This culminated in frequent touring, including a co-headlining stint with Viva Voce.

&gt; The band finished a three-week tour opening for Australian rockers Wolfmother on December 9, 2006, and have toured with OK Go and Snow Patrol on their U.S. spring tour, which ended on April 10, 2007. The Pickups played at the Coachella Music Festival in Indio, California on April 27, 2007.

&gt; The band supported Foo Fighters, along with Nine Inch Nails on August 21st 2007 as part of the 'T on the Fringe' music festival in Edinburgh, Scotland, and then on the 22nd in Marley Park, Dublin, Ireland. They also performed at the Carling Reading and Leeds festivals on the 25th/26th August 2007 and supported Kaiser Chiefs on their Autumn European tour and Snow Patrol on their tour of Australia (with Paolo from Snow Patrol joining them regularly to play guitar on Lazy Eye and Nikki guesting on vocals for Snow Patrol's Set The Fire To The Third Bar onstage). On some of these dates the band have been covering Joy Division's Shadowplay and Bjork's Big Time Sensuality, both of which have been recorded for web or radio sessions.

&gt; The second full studio album, entitled ""Swoon"", was released 14th April 2009 in both the US and UK.

&gt; The band was also part of Lollapalooza 2009 in Chicago, IL, Voodoo Fest 2009 and 2012  in New Orleans, and the 2009 Sasquatch! Festival.

&gt; In early 2010, they supported the UK anthem-rock superstars Muse for several of their North American dates for The Resistance tour. Read more on Last.fm.

After 18 months of anticipation, the Treasury Department released on Tuesday a seminal report examining the barriers to financial technology and innovation in the United States and proposing a sweeping set of recommendations designed to cut red tape and foster continued experimentation.


While the report only mentions cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies in passing, many of the current problems it highlights and recommendations it proposes are highly germane to the crypto industry and nonbank financial entities of all stripes.


These include calls for the streamlining of complex and convoluted financial regulation frameworks for activities such as money transmission and payments, and for further implementation of fintech regulatory sandboxes, such as those that have been successfully deployed in places like the United Kingdom, Singapore and Hong Kong internationally, as well as Arizona in the U.S. - which will officially launch on August 1.


“Financial regulation should be modernized to more appropriately address the evolving characteristics of financial services of today and in the future,” the report states, emphasizing:


It goes on to specifically recommend that “the states work to harmonize money transmitter requirements for licensing and supervisory examinations.”


Money transmission licensing rules have been a perpetual thorn in the side of cryptocurrency companies operating in the U.S., as the activity is regulated on a state-by-state basis and no license passporting structure exists as it does in places like the European Union.


Treasury also noted that blockchain, distributed ledger technologies and digital assets are being separately examined in interagency fashion by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a group which was established after the 2008 Financial Crisis as a forum for convening federal financial regulators around issues of systemic importance.


The report was commissioned via executive order by President Donald Trump shortly after he took office in February 2017 with the purpose of constructing a series of recommendations for making the U.S. financial system more nimble, competitive and capable of embracing and incubating new technologies.


Concerns Being Heard


The core theme of the 222 page report is that more governmental support for innovators and entrepreneurs is required across the board, and that Treasury is keen provide that push when necessary within the regulatory ranks


“Support of innovation is critical across the regulatory system — both at the federal and state levels,” the report states. “Treasury supports encouraging the launch of new business models … to pursue innovative technologies to lower costs, improve customer outcomes, and improve access to credit and other services.”


It introspectively reckons that many current financial regulation structures are outdated given the changing pace of technology, and that this dynamic could squeeze out innovation that could potentially benefit consumers and businesses:


Sandbox Solutions


Another carrying theme from the report is that of fostering “agile governance,” or an approach to regulation “that can evolve with innovation.” One battle-tested way of doing this internationally has been through the use of regulatory sandboxes that provide a safe space for companies to experiment with new products and allow regulators and entrepreneurs to learn side-by-side with one another.


“Treasury recommends that federal and state financial regulators establish a unified solution that coordinates and expedites regulatory relief under applicable laws and regulations to permit meaningful experimentation for innovative products, services, and processes,” the report states.


“Such efforts would form, in essence, a ‘regulatory sandbox’ that can enhance and promote innovation,” it continues, urging Congress to step in with a legislative solution if financial regulators and individual states are unable to achieve such an objective.


These types of laboratories will be critical for bringing the U.S. financial technology scene back to par with other countries that have been quicker out of the gate and have less inertia embedded in their regulatory schemes.


“Innovation has played a factor in making the U.S. capital markets the largest, deepest, and most vibrant in the world and has been of critical importance in supporting the U.S. economy,” the report finds, concluding:

I'm still trying to wrap my head around the ethical conundrum of sovereignty/independence for so many African countries, and how Europe doesn't seem to bear any explicit responsibility for the present condition of the continent.

On one hand, obviously a nation formed from imperialist slavery deserves independence way before it demands it. On the other hand, how do you ethically give a nation independence when the vast majority of its populace is uneducated (because the reigning powers intentionally left them uneducated)?

I have studied the history of the DRC pretty extensively. One fact that still leaves me floored is that–when the Democratic Republic of the Congo finally demanded and subsequently achieved independence in 1960, there were only a *handful* of natives with college degrees. I've read some sources which say 12 people, in the entire country, had college educations. Some say 30 people. Some estimate that it was about ~60 people. Regardless, how do you ethically hand power and democracy to such a population, especially with a staggeringly small amount of educated population?

Not to mention the meddling of USSR's KGB and USA's CIA–who are definitely on record as meddling with the political installment of the kleptocratic dictator that reigned for the following 37 years...

But let me give my rebuttal.

Many of those countries have some pretty strict consumer protection laws. Compare that to the states. Example is in that European countries have some strict privacy laws for consumers, making businesses protect consumer info. Here in the states, we rely on individual states to make laws doing that, with some states saying ""eh if the consumers info gets out there it's their own fault"".

That step by step would work in a perfect world, but we don't live in a perfect world where both sides of the aisle will work with one another. Maybe like 20 years ago we'd have an actual chance at that, but currently we don't. Hence why the Trump admin has been gutting the ACA where they can for no reason beyond the obvious ""because we can"". And that step by step would also work wonders if the price of care, both for visits, surgery, medication, etc wasn't constantly rising. But because prices constantly rise, the knee jerk reaction is ""NO YOURE DESTROYING THE MARKET"" when in reality the market is destroying itself.

I have no idea what you're talking about here, because I never mentioned any polls saying the majority want Medicare for all. Hell I didn't mention polls at all.

&gt;Venomous snakes generally dont try to hide the fact that they're venomous. They use bright colors and high contrast to warn other animals that they're dangerous, 

the vast majority of the most venomous snakes in Australia (the brown snakes, mulga snake, both taipans, lowland copperheads, death adder) are neither bright or high contrast, they vary from shades of brown to yellow, grey, reddish or black, colours that are unsurprisingly *suitable for their habitats*.  
same goes for rattle snakes. or the common European adder. or the four mambas (three of them are bright green, but they do live in bright green trees in tropical Africa).  
there's *a lot* of snakes that are hard to spot in their natural habitats. 

&gt;Also, more triangular/diamond shaped heads (vs the sleek shape of non-venomous snakes heads) are very good indicators of a venomous snake. Snakes venom glands are situated on the sides of their heads, giving them a distinct head shape. 

this statement is kinda true but also extremely problematic as it only addresses a part of the venomous snakes, i.e. vipers like rattle snakes. on the other hand, a non triangular head shape gives you *zero* information about a snakes venomousness.  
take a look at most of the Australian snakes I just mentioned, like the [eastern brown snake](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Eastern_Brown_Snake_-_Kempsey_NSW.jpg). or the [inland taipan](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Fierce_Snake-Oxyuranus_microlepidotus.jpg/800px-Fierce_Snake-Oxyuranus_microlepidotus.jpg). here's the [green mamba](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Dendroaspis_viridisPCCA20051227-1885B.jpg).

Yes, that's exactly what I mean with ""interested"". Able and willing. Maybe should have been more precise.

&gt; No, I'm not assuming there would be only one. But why exactly would another one want to fight with them--it would be far more convenient to simply join forces together. Because what is the second PMC getting by opposing them? Money? Because they would get that by joining up with other PMC group as well.

That's an unproven assumption on your part. You are assuming a cartel-like behavior, but there aren't many good practical examples of functional cartels. Just as union strikes are generally broken by scabs that stand to win if they do, cartels have deserters and competitors that stand to win if they don't adhere to the cartel. Most all known cases of cartel behavior did not work because of this. Other PMCs would have a lot to win, from simple reputation (which is terribly important in the market, see how yelp reviews can ruin a business reputation and force it out of the market), to lots of clients and money. Undercutting the competition is one of the main ways of winning clients.

So, based on history and how people are, I beg to differ.

&gt; There would be a vacuum of power in an ancap society which would encourage groups to come along and try to seize that power which would then effectively make them the state at that point.

A vacuum of power only emerges when a State apparatus is left headless. That's how Bolsheviks got to control Russia, by taking over the existing State apparatus created by the monarchy. One can look at Somalia to more or less see what happens if there is no functional State apparatus to take over. Is the more stateless parts there they don't have a power vacuum, instead they have tribal rule. And trying to impose a State over a group of people that don't have one already there is much harder that simply taking over an existing one as the Bolsheviks did. When the Spanish conquered the Inca, they also did exactly that. But they could not do that with the stateless mapuche people, in fact they could not conquer them. The mapuche resisted european (and later Chilean State) rule for some 400 years, all while being stateless, and likely because of it, as the would-be conquerors had no State apparatus to seize.

&gt; ...Ah yes, because the small towns of several thousand people are going to have tanks and warships at their disposal...jesus christ dude.

American Revolution. Many towns had cannons and military-grade weapons, privately owned. Many americans had privately-owned warships. All military-grade for the time. I don't see the difficulty there. Are you forgetting that they would have the money that would otherwise be taken as taxes at their disposal? That's a lot of extra money people right now don't have because the State takes it away. A quick estimate would be that people would have double the income or even more. In most countries the States deprive people of at least half of what they produce, usually more.

&gt; I don't have to explain why that is the case. Go look at history. Whenever their is a power vacuum groups always try and move in to grab said power.

I look at history and I don't see mercenaries trying to take over places like Venice or Florence or the Hanseatic League cities. On the contrary, I see mercenaries mostly honoring their contracts with them, and the more reputable companies having more financial success. I lots of other cases I don't see what you say.

Playing on Android

This should go without saying: I'm active every day and can deliver:

the maximum amount of tokens every season.

a finished prestige cup every season.

1.5m-3.0m RP/season (depending on my spare time and the usual struggle to play live races on android).

What critical thinking have you engaged in to separate propaganda by the victor against a belligerent in a war from objective fact?

&gt;Could you, as a challenge, justify the Nazi's extermination even if the number, as you claim, is inflated?

The evidence I've seen up to this time has not conclusively shown that the Nazis intended to exterminate the Jews.  There is plenty of evidence that many Germans intensely disliked Jews (like most Europeans)—and for understandable and in some cases perhaps justifiable reasons (diasporic people tend to be dishonest toward their hosts, because they continuously pick up and leave, similar to gypsy con artists)—and that the Nazis were going to deport them to another land where they could have their own nation, but there is not but the sparsest of evidence they intentionally genocided them, which is why the Nuremberg trials, the sham that they were, relied on the postulation that the Nazis engaged in euphemisms to carry it out.

What I think probably happened was the Germans were going to deport them, then a major war was forced on them and their economy and military were not entirely ready for it—and neither was the deportation program of the Jews.  The Allies bombed German supply lines to nothing and it had a significant effect on both German civilians and Jewish civilians.  There's testimony by one Jewish inmate that the Nazi camp officials didn't have much food either.

The Germans were in a tight spot (had continuously been in a tight spot since the close of WW1) and used forced labor as an expedient.  Along with many of the German civilians and soldiers who died from starvation and typhus, many of these Jewish inmates did as well, and the number was probably more around 200k-300k, not 1 million, 3 million, or 6 million.  The logistics of those camps could not process so high of numbers.

&gt;I feel like you're taking a very rosy eyed view of the Nazis

Not at all.  I'm sure a number of their leadership were psychopaths, as tends to be the case (tell me with a straight face Anglo-American leadership wasn't also filled with psychopaths, being that they just forced a war that would killing millions of people and all for marginal benefits to business) and I'm sure some Jews were in fact murdered, but those murders would be spontaneous events, like the suppression of resistance cells in Poland or revenge for the murder of a German official, and such events are quite common in history.

&gt;Maybe a simpler way to get at the heart of my confusion would be to ask from which standpoint are you making these arguments? Are you a Nazi sympathizer?

I'm primarily being a critical thinker with regard to Anglo-American culture.  I don't think we were the good guys at all.  We didn't know about concentration camps (and had our own concentration camps back home of the Japanese), even if you believe all the propaganda that's been written about them (much of it by Soviet liars).

The initiation of the war was based on paper-thin arguments and it's why there was a post-war indirect framing using the Holocaust that we were liberators and that the German people were oppressed by the Nazi regime (they were not, as postwar polling showed and which you're probably never told about in school).

It would be incredibly rare for these things to go from good guy-bad guy to bad guy-good guy.

While Syrians who have stayed in the country between 5 and 15 years don’t stand out as a singular case, they are still the fourth lowest-ranked country by employment rate for both men and women. The situation for Somalis looks particularly problematic, with only 32.03 % of working-age men and 23.06 % of working-age women being in employment after at least 5 years of residence in the country. Almost all Muslim-majority countries have very low female employment rates; this is even true for the groups with the longest presence in the country such as Pakistanis (34.56%), Morocco (41.27%), and Turkey (44.76%). Somali, Iraqi, Syrian, Lebanese, and Afghani women all have employment rates below 40 %. The most telling results are those where a group has a low employment rate combined with a high benefits rate. People may stay outside of the labor market for a range of reasons, and by doing so they are not eligible for benefits; many non-natives who marry a Dane fall into this category, for example.

I think Liverpool will be the toughest opponent, if we win the league again this year it won't be as easy as last season and definitely the margin will be less than 19 points. 
Liverpool had a problem a problem of fucking up against lesser team and waste a lot of easy points. The signing of Alisson and the comeback of Nathaniel Clyne will strengthen their defense alot. On the other hand the signing of Shaqiri will give them offensive depth as well as diversity on their style of play. Fabinho and Keita are very strong defensive and offensive options either in recovering the ball or building up the attack. Their midfield lacks a bit of creativity but is balanced with the high intensity and energy they use in their style of play and pressing 
Predicted league position: 2nd

2.*Chelsea*
My perception of Kanté as a player is he's amazing in any defensive style of play and he'd be amazing in any offensive team like Liverpool. But I'm never convinced he'll do good in Guardiola's team for example or -My guess- Sarri's team he's too slow on the ball, very bad passing range and not too much accuracy in passing or chance creation and that's why they signed Jorginho, if you play Kanté in a more advanced position you'll lose a big part of the chance creation. Honestly I don't know how this will end up for Kanté, you can't sell a player like that and you can't play him in a system like Sarri's. 
I think Chelsea will take a bit of time but they'll have an amazing season reaching a points tally north of 80 but not winning the league as they'll struggle against us and Liverpool and probably winning 50% against Arsenal and United. 
They're not going to sell any of their star players and Hazard/Barkley to shine and have a huge season. 
Predicted league position: 3rd-4th

3.*Arsenal*
Arsenal are going through an unexpected and a very interesting project. 
I really don't have much to say about Arsenal but if you play fantasy premier league I suggest you invest in AUBAMAYANG. The guy looks scary tbh probably scoring 20+ with Ozil And mkhitaryan supplying chance after chance. They have a very good squad but I'll wait to see them in our game which I really don't know how hard it will be on us
Predicted league position: 3rd-4th

4.*Man Utd*
I think the problem in Man United team is not the squad. They have a very good set of players that can play amazingly like we've seen in the world cup. But their problem will be in the tactics and style of play that mourinho chooses for the team. Last season they played 9 preseason games and started the season ln a very good form and that helped them edge the teams that started slowly and were not very ready in terms of fitness levels and united had a very good fixture list last season. One more thing is Wenger and Conte were pure fuckups last season which is not the case this one so I think this will be harsh on United
Predicted league position: 5th

5.*Spurs*
I hafe nothing to say😂
I don't think they'll go through the transfer season without signing a single player. There must be someone in their mind and they're waiting for the right moment to start negotiating. Tbh they have a fairly good squad which is capable of putting pressure on the league winner but never surpass him. Thing is everyone around them is evolving and they're still in the same place which will cause them problems this season unless they're going to sign someone or change their tactics a little they'll be the same as last season but everyone around them is not the same that's why they fall in position.
Predicted league position: 6th



Teams I think will show good character this season:

-Everton: good signings in Richarlison and Lucas Digne and they already have a good squad. Marco Silva can do us a surprise and reach European football this season.

-Westham: With the signing of Yarmolenko, Jack Wilshire and Filipe Anderson. Manuel Pellegrini have a very good squad in his hands to have a good season and finish in top 10 at least if not reach the Europa league.

-Fulham: What is really happening guys? They give me the impression they very easily convince De Bruyne to join them 😅
Top 10 finish expected.

Wall of text that may be interesting about jurisdiction

&gt;An individual is domiciled in England if they are (i) resident in the jurisdiction and (ii) the nature and circumstances of their residence indicate a substantial connection with the jurisdiction. The English Courts have held that an individual can be resident in multiple jurisdictions. This may be the case where a defendant has business interests in multiple jurisdictions and spends periods of time in each. The English Court will consider all of the circumstances when deciding whether an individual is resident in this jurisdiction. The fact that a defendant owns a property in England is, on its own, unlikely to be sufficient. The claimant must show that there is a good arguable case that the property is the defendant's settled or usual place of abode (i.e. where they live). A degree of permanency is required. The English Court is likely to take into account factors such as whether the defendant's family lives at the property and the number of nights the defendant has spent at that property in recent years, compared to nights spent in other jurisdictions. It is also likely to consider the portion of the defendant's business interests that are in this jurisdiction, compared to other jurisdictions.

&gt;The English Court will automatically have jurisdiction over a defendant who is domiciled outside the European Union if the defendant can be served with the claim form while in England. This includes where papers are served on an individual who is only visiting the jurisdiction. However, in these circumstances the defendant can argue that the English Court should not exercise its jurisdiction if there is a more appropriate forum (known as the doctrine of ""forum non conveniens"").

&gt; If the defendant cannot be served while in England, the claimant will need to obtain the English Court's permission to serve the claim form outside the jurisdiction.  In order to obtain permission, the claimant will have to show (in relation to each cause of action which forms part of the claim) that: (1) there is a serious issue to be tried in relation to the foreign defendant (i.e. the claim must have a real prospect of success); (2) there is a good arguable case that the claim falls within one or more of the ""jurisdictional gateways"" set out in the Civil Procedure Rules; and (3) England is clearly the appropriate forum for the case and the Court ought to exercise its discretion to permit service of the proceedings out of the jurisdiction.

&gt; One of the ""jurisdictional gateways"" relates to claims in tort where the damage was sustained within the jurisdiction or resulted from an act committed within the jurisdiction. For example, if an English bank is induced to lend money to a borrower abroad by misrepresentations, the damage can be said to have been sustained in this jurisdiction, as the loan was advanced in England.

&gt; Another gateway is where the dispute relates to a contract which is governed by English law or contains a term conferring jurisdiction on the English Courts to determine any claim in respect of the contract.

&gt; Another useful gateway in fraud litigation is the ""necessary or proper gateway"". If one defendant is served (either in England or with the Court's permission pursuant to one of the other jurisdictional gateways), then the claimant can obtain permission to serve the claim form on another person outside the European Union who is a necessary or proper party to the claim. This gateway can be very useful in fraud litigation where there are often a number of defendants based in different jurisdictions.

&gt; When considering if the English Court is clearly the appropriate forum for the dispute to be determined, the factors the English Court may consider are wide, and include: (i) the personal connections the parties have to the countries which are relevant to the dispute (ii) the factual focus of the dispute (i.e. in what country/countries did the relevant events occur) (iii) factors affecting convenience or expense, such as the location of witnesses and / or documents (iv) applicable law and (v) whether the matter would receive a fair trial in another jurisdiction.",True,False,False,,0,1533114234,,False,0,e3ei2ga,False,t3_93n3r4,True,t1_e3ehs0q,/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/93n3r4/can_bvi_company_use_uk_courts_against_a_nonuk/e3ei2ga/,,1536955512,1,True,False,LegalAdviceUK,t5_32g6u,r/LegalAdviceUK,public,

As for your current issue, I think there are several potential causes you might want to consider. 

\- Make sure you are using the signature series. The difference between the traditional and signature is massive. Once they release the European cut for sax, I would recommend that as well. 

\- Légère reeds have a similar strength to Vandoren reeds, thus making them harder than a typical Rico reed. Check [here](https://www.legere.com/strength-charts) to find a Légère that matches your current cane reed. 

\- Légère reeds must be placed perfectly on the mouthpiece and secured firmly. Attempting to use a heavily worn Rovner or a cheap generic ligature may move the reed around, causing response issues. 

\- Try different mouthpieces with your Légère and see if the tone/responsiveness changes. I currently use a Légère 3 on my baritone sax along with a Selmer C\* and have had excellent results. I'm not suggesting that you go and buy a $250 mouthpiece, but if the previous two steps do not help, try experimenting with other mouthpieces. 

\- When playing on a Légère, especially on baritone sax, loosen your embouchure slightly more than usual. This often helps with the added firmness of synthetic reeds. 

\- Finally, make sure to touch your tongue to the very tip of the reed. I know many bari players that tongue too low on their reeds and are able to get away with it. Not only is this extremely limiting and an example of poor technique, but it makes playing on synthetic reeds nigh impossible. 

After a couple years of heavy playing, I use Légère signature reeds almost exclusively on classical soprano, alto, tenor, and bari.  It will take some trial and error to find the best reed and setup though, so stay diligent.

TEHRAN, Iran –  Iran's parliament announced Wednesday it would hold a special session to question President Hassan Rouhani about the plummeting currency and struggling economy.

In the announcement on the parliament's website, lawmakers said Rouhani must appear within a month in an open session to answer questions, but no specific date was announced.

The rial has slipped since the U.S. pulled out of the nuclear deal in May and said it would restore sanctions that had been lifted in exchange for Iran curbing its atomic activities. The first of those renewed sanctions go into effect Monday.

Iran is negotiating with other world powers that are parties to the deal — China, Russia, Germany, France, Britain as well as the European Union — in a bid to salvage it with new incentives.

Lawmakers plan to separately question Labor Minister Ali Rabiei over the 12.5 percent unemployment rate. He already appeared before parliament in March, when they voted to keep him in office.

Pressure is building on Rouhani as Iran's economic woes mount. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has ordered Rouhani, the speaker of parliament and the head of the judiciary to work together and find a way to resolve the problems.

On Tuesday, 200 of 290 members of parliament signed a letter to Rouhani urging him to make changes to his economic team.

Rouhani's administration has already replaced the central bank governor and taken other measures to shore up the currency, which hit a new low this week.

Meanwhile, some hard-liners have called for new elections or for Rouhani's civilian government to be replaced by a military-led one.

The Fars news agency, believed to be close to Iran's hard-line elite Revolutionary Guard, in July distributed an op-ed from the Sobh-e No daily newspaper describing the government as too ready to ""bow down to foreign threats.""

False,ReadTheArticleBitch,1531801744.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_1sj151xm,"**Aloha to you, too, ungrateful mainlanders**

The Hawaiian dictionary defines “aloha” as “love, affection, compassion, mercy, sympathy, pity, kindness, sentiment, grace, charity.” It is a synonym for “sweetheart” or “loved one,” “hello,” “farewell” and “beloved, loving, kind, compassionate, charitable, lovable.” It is also a verb meaning “to love” or “to show kindness, mercy, pity, charity, affection.”

The word means a lot to those of us with Hawaiian roots. So we were upset to hear that a fast-food chain in Chicago called Aloha Poke Co. has been sending letters ordering companies in Hawaii and elsewhere to stop using “aloha” in their names. Aloha Poke sells food in bowls meant to resemble poke, a Hawaiian dish made of raw fish and seaweed and other seasonings. Nobody in Hawaii told these guys they couldn’t do this to our beloved poke, even though they are making it wrong, or that they couldn’t make commercial use of our greatest word.

The word is free, of course, and is used by us in a spirit that is open and welcoming to those who want to share. The reaction in Hawaii to the cease-and-desist “aloha” letters has been anger and disbelief. But the trouble, the pilikia, is for real. A native-Hawaiian poke-shop owner in Alaska  told The Washington Post that after getting the letter she abandoned the name “Aloha Poke Stop” and spent thousands of dollars removing “aloha” from her company’s signs and T-shirts and other materials.

The company claims it was misunderstood and meant no harm. Its claim on the word “aloha’’ is irritating and absurd, but since Aloha Poke chose to go down that road, maybe we should all think about this a little. Maybe we should all re-examine the world’s relationship with Hawaii with an eye to reciprocity and ownership and fair compensation.

It’s not that the mainland hasn’t given us things. Christianity, for which many (not all) of us say a heartfelt thank you. Western diseases and a colonial mindset, of which we are less appreciative. Spam, which all of us outside our cardiology community love. But the perspective from the islands is that for centuries we have been giving, giving and giving, while the rest of you have been taking, taking and taking.

Taking what? you ask.

Surfing. You may not realize that your ancestors found ocean waves terrifying. Mark Twain, visiting in 1866, saw islanders surfing and freaked out. We give him credit for trying it, though. People the world over have surf, but only the Hawaiians perfected surfing. It’s ours; please return it and find some other way to have fun in the water.

The hula. This is a dance of beauty and grace and spiritual power, a foundation of Hawaiian culture. That thing you do at parties with the plastic leis, grass skirts and flapping arms — could you stop calling it hula, or just stop doing it altogether?

The ukulele. This instrument has a European ancestor, the braguinha, brought to the islands by the Portuguese. But we refined it and gave it a new name, meaning “jumping flea,” and we still make the best ones, out of native koa wood, and our Hawaii-born musicians work wonders with them. We are very sorry, mainland hipsters, this isn’t your fault. But we would like our ukes back.

The steel guitar.  Back when Joseph Kekuku, a country boy from Laie, on Oahu, was a child, he slid a steel bolt along the strings of his guitar, making a lovely sound.  He trained himself and others on the new way to play, which spread to the mainland and into honky-tonk history. Please remove the twang from your country and western music and return it to us.

Cowboys. Speaking of country and western, the idea of men on horseback driving cattle to market — our paniolos did that first, in the 1830s, a few decades before your cowpokes and cowpunchers. If you could please rejigger your movies and rewrite your frontier mythology and have your guys chase those dogies on foot or with A.T.V.’s or drones or what have you. Thanks.

Sugar and pineapple. You liked those, all those years, didn’t you? You’re welcome.

“Over the Rainbow,” the soulful version.  Go ahead and keep Judy Garland’s song, but we would like Iz Kamakawiwo’ole’s back. His voice is the pure heart of Hawaii that contains all the sorrow and joy and aloha in the world, which is why you can’t stop listening to it. Please stop.

Casual Friday and aloha shirts. These floppy floral shirts were invented in Honolulu, as was the practice of wearing them once a week to unstiffen the workplace. Our “aloha Friday” became your “casual Friday,” and “aloha shirts” became “Hawaiian shirts.” You didn’t ask. You have polo shirts and baseball caps; use those.

Your superpower status. Who repaired and refloated all but two American warships destroyed in Pearl Harbor in 1941, so that the United States Navy could defeat the Japanese empire? Workers in Honolulu did. Where did those Japanese-American soldiers brave enough to give their right arms to protect democracy and freedom in Europe come from? You know where. Today you get to sleep well in places like Chicago, knowing that the United States is projecting its military might into the Pacific, the ocean we are in the middle of. Meanwhile, we are the ones who get spooked by reports of North Korean missiles. How fair is that?

Racial harmony. When civil-rights marchers were being shot in Mississippi, and before the Supreme Court, in the Loving case, struck down bans on interracial marriage, the state of Hawaii was sending its governor to Botswana, a new democracy in southern Africa hemmed in by racist regimes. A Honolulu newspaperman hailed the moment: “The Hawaii-Botswana relationship is a long-range friendship, designed to help the earth resound from pole to pole with one famous cry, ‘Aloha!’” Why? The two places are antipodes — exactly opposite each other on the globe — but they had in common a culture of racial harmony and peace. Interracial marriage was truly unremarkable in Hawaii then, and Botswana’s new president, Seretse Khama, was married to a white English woman. That was 1966. What took the rest of you so long?

Barack Obama. Are you through with him? A lot of you seem to have moved on. Please send him back to Kailua.

The aloha spirit. It’s easy to be cynical if you spend any time in Waikiki. But the spirit of aloha is a real thing in Hawaii. It’s what makes honeymooners all honeymooney; they can sense it in the scented air the moment they get off the plane. It’s what keeps us going, despite our many problems of homelessness, income inequality, environmental ruin, rat-race traffic —  the kindness of family and friends, the welcome to strangers, the warm, motley, mixed-up way our immigrant forebears and our Hawaiian host culture have blended. It’s the way we are when we are relaxing with poke and beer and ukuleles at the beach.

It’s aloha, and it’s not for sale. I say this with love, affection, compassion, mercy, sympathy, pity, kindness, sentiment, grace and charity.

Pra entender porque as coisas são como são é sempre bom ver o histórico da coisa, e no caso da teologia isso é FUNDAMENTAL, só a história da teologia explica porque as correntes atuais são como são.

Então recomendo procurar livros de história da teologia. Justo Gonzales talvez seja a fonte mais usada no meio evangélico brasileiro (No meio neopentecostal não sei, não tenho certeza se estes sabem ler). Se for católico recomendo IGNORAR a Editora Vozes (Feita pra riponga amigos do Lula, tipo o Leonardo Boff) e ir pra editora Paulus, não tem um condensado, nem um autor mais proeminente, justo por ter mais vendas o assunto é pulverizado em vários livros (E não é tudo tão católico assim, um clássico da história a.C. é John Bright, que é um presbiteriano dos EUA, mas é publicado justo pela Paulus! É simples questão de qualidade, autores como John Bright, Bengt Hägglund e Justo Gonzales transcendem sua denominação.

Se pular a história de como tudo ficou como ficou, e partir direto pra leitura interpretativa de texto bíblico, você provavelmente irá cair nos MESMOS erros que centenas de igrejotas caíram ao serem fundadas no passado. Evite isso, você não vai revolucionar o mundo, especialmente porque estamos falando de conteúdo estático, os livros-base pra teologia não mudam a muuuuitos séculos então não tem como tirar uma interpretação nova disso.

Fora a parte histórica, recomendo títulos de **teologia sistemática**. A sistematização é simplesmente a organização da coisa, definir que se o texto bíblico diz que A=B e que A=C, então só se pode concluir que B=C apesar do texto não citar isso. Todas as grandes correntes do cristianismo tem seus títulos de teologia sistemática, se for católico, metodista, luterano, batista, terá livros de teologia sistemática pra servir de base. Se for pentecostal terá menos títulos. Se for neopentecostal duvido que tenha alguma coisa que preste, nessa área tem muita encheção de linguiça, só conteúdo pastoral ou auto-ajuda, nada de sistematização e lógica que eu tenha visto.

Posso ajudar com os grandes autores de cada área, mas preciso saber qual sua denominação ou linha de igreja, não existe sistemática não-denominacional (História tem, porque no passado não tinha um milhão de denominações), afinal o que diferencia as denominações é justo os diferentes métodos de sistematizações e as diferenças resultantes na sistematização a partir de pequenas alterações nas bases de crenças (No exemplo dado, digamos que um entender que A=B e outro entende que A simboliza B, pra não cair nesses erros interpretativos TEM QUE fazer muita exegese de texto (Esse podcast evangélico dessa semana é sobre [exegese bíblica](http://bibotalk.com/podcast/exegese-biblica-btcast-256/)), e TEM QUE recorrer ao texto original as vezes, ou seja, aprender grego e hebraico (Eu aprendi. E foram **muito** úteis FORA da teologia!), mas também é bom ver como isso foi historicamente traduzido ao longo dos séculos (Pra isso se aprende latim, inglês, alemão, ou outro idioma por onde sua denominação andou no passado. Latim não é útil só pra católicos (Afinal por 1500 anos não tinha igreja católica, tinha só ""igreja""), mesmo as traduções romanas explicam muito sobre umas praxes pentecostais atuais, simples questão de manutenção vestigial de tradição que ninguém mais nota). Enfim, pra não cair em AINDA mais erros de interpretação TEM QUE saber esmiuçar um texto (Antes de ir pra faculdade eu já fazia ""exegese"" porque em TI o peso da diferença de IF e ELSE é grande num programa, ou um datasheet de componente a diferença entre VA e Watt resulta em ainda mais diferenças. Noobs não enxergam esses detalhes e vivem fazendo cagada), e pra isso precisa saber as bases da exegese, e as bases da tradução, pra você escolher qual usa, afinal com séculos de história não tem nada novo, tudo já foi discutido e esmiuçado ao máximo, é só você escolher o que pra sua visão é a interpretação correta, mas tem que basear isso não com chutometro, e sim com base no texto original e em coerência (Se A=B e A=C, não não dá pra fazer ginástica interpretativa pra dizer que B é diferente de C).

Again, I think this is a case of selectively choosing the correct forecasts of ""your side"". There were numerous outright lies made by politicians in the Remain camp. 

The Remain camp certainly had analyses for economic consequences on its side, and Leave may have indeed lied more, but I don't think this equates to the campaign being basically honest. 

&gt;I don't understand this statement

Do you treat a general election vote as a wholesale endorsement of a given manifesto?

&gt; would not have expected these things to have materialised yet because we have not left, the nature of negotiation means that we will not be able to exercise unalloyed sovereignty because we will still international agreements which will necessarily require the surrender of some degree of sovereignty

Sure, but I don't think this prevents you from making qualitative judgements about sovereignty pre- vs. post-Brexit. Take international agreements which keep us in the WTO or ILO; they may require a sacrifice of some degree of sovereignty, but given that such bodies are multilateral global organisations which tend to draft regulations on a consensus-basis, rather than being a supranational government which operates with majoritarian voting, I think you can absolutely make a value-judgement about which is superior with respect to sovereignty. 

Same goes for bilaterally creating trade deals with other countries rather than being in a custom's union.

Same goes for being under an activist [foreign court](https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/speech-131120.pdf): 

&gt;Third, the Strasbourg court’s approach to judicial lawmaking gives rise, as it seems to me, to a
significant democratic deficit in some important areas of social policy. This is a particular
problem given the inherently political character of many of the issues which it decides. Most of
the human rights recognised by the Convention are qualified by express exceptions for cases
where the national law or action complained of was “necessary in a democratic society” (or some
equivalent phrase). The case-law of the Strasbourg court provides a good deal of guidance about
how these qualifications are to be applied. The court must ask itself a number of questions [. . .] 
These questions have only to be stated for it to be obvious that they are questions of policy.
Most people would regard them as inherently political questions. But their inclusion in the
Convention to a considerable extent removes them from the arena of legitimate political debate,
by transforming them into questions of law for judges.

You're assuming that socialism means ""no private property."" Go meet with members of (or go to the websites of) just about any standard European socialist party (SPDs, Labor Parties, etc.) and you'll notice that none of them really call for the elimination of private property. You'll then be at a cross roads: are you wrong about socialism or are socialists wrong about socialism. I trust you to recognize that earlier road will be more fruitful for you.

What socialists might (and often do) think can be helpful and important is a more democratic control over essential industries and strategic resources. In the 19th century this was shorthanded as ""the means of production."" Sometimes this would mean seizure of an existing industry, other times it would mean the creation of a government-industry upon the discovery of new resources and possibilities. A great instance of the latter would be upon discovering oil in the North Sea, the socialist-led Norwegian government recognized that the territory and the resource belonged to the Norwegian people, not to a privately-held company. So the government (democratically elected by the Norwegian people) decided to set up and lead its own oil business and put all the revenue into social programs. Seems reasonable to me, and it's turned Norway from one of Europe's poorest countries to one of the world's wealthiest. Generally, socialists think that this more democratic ownership of strategic and essential industries can benefit entire nations of people in countless ways - provided that scrupulous and accountable systems and people are set up to lead.

Also - Marxist aren't universally constitutive of socialism. Marx has a place at the table in talking about Socialism in the same way that Roman Catholics have a place at the table when talking about Christianity - important but not all encompassing.

The UK is a net contributor to the EU financially, is one of the most important and powerful nations on the planet in terms of defence and soft-power projection, has the strongest navy in the EU (as bad as it may be these days), is the gateway to North America, uses the world language of business and trade (English) which it also helps retain as the core EU language (without us, it'd likely turn to French, which most of the world does not come close to understanding).

The UK also is a net importer of goods, particularly from the EU, as a result of which there is substantial leverage in the form of trade. As much as people on here will try to argue that the EU cares less about our purchases because they are 27 countries and overall more people/GDP etc. the underlying fact is that the UK is an incredibly important economical piece of the EU, Europe as a whole (which we're not leaving of course) and losing our purchasing power would be a difficult pill to swallow. This isn't to say that the UK would not enjoy losing plenty of the EU sourced imports it currently enjoys, so I'm not trying to say it's a one way street in favour of the UK, but it certainly isn't solely in favour of the EU either.

As the financial capital of the world, in the ideal timezone, using the ideal language, with the best infrastructure and supporting infrastructure and most crucially, English Common Law, it is unlikely that the UK is going to lose this crown.

All manufacturing is relocating to cheaper locations within the world as part of globalisation, the UK suffers from this just like all major developed nations suffer. The only reason Germany is so strong on this is because of its dramatic advantage gained by getting to use the heavily deflated currency of the Euro, pinned down far lower than a sovereign Germany's currency would be otherwise, allowing for a dramatic export advantage.

Big business always does what's best for big business and you will see that manufacturing in developed nations will continue to decline, it will be buoyed by the likes of automation and technological advances, but that won't save the jobs. Those jobs are going to decline, whether it be to foreign nations or robots, they are going.

No denying that the UK was the sick man of Europe in the decades following WW2, which by the way, the UK effectively sacrificed its entire empire and dominant status in the world to win alongside their major allies such as the USA, France, Russia and the rest of the commonwealth and other allied nations. With such sacrifice comes great decline and a war that was so costly to so many across the world was naturally deeply damaging to the nation which was at the top. You could also argue that the roots of WW2 were sewn during WW1, which was largely a war about Imperial Germany being envious of the dominant position the UK and France enjoyed over the seas and the world and wanting to have its turn.

The early days of the EU helped the UK go from being over-regulated and bogged down in bureaucracy, to a more streamlined nation which was more open and deregulated, modern and forward thinking, much more in line with the other members of the EEC (as it was then known). In those days the EEC was definitely the place to be and you'll find few British citizens who will deny that it was a good decision to join such a trading area and cooperate given the position we were in.

However, in recent decades it has been the EU that has started to get bogged down, overly bureaucratic and legislative, bloated and slow to evolve, the power hungry nature of those at the top of the EU has seen it expand too much and too quickly and there are great problems and division among so many of the member states. The EU suddenly isn't the most perfect place to be and the UK is in a position where it can realistically consider that a different path may be a better way to go (although this is up for debate).

Finally, with regard to these organisations, regulatory bodies, standards, rules and regulations that you mentioned. It is only natural for a deeply entwined and committed relationship spanning many nations, many decades and vast levels of complexity, to be immensely difficult to unravel and separate from in a sensible and rapid manner. This would be the most complex divorce in history that could take decades of unraveling before the deep roots are separated properly and fairly. Just because this fact exists and that it may be exceedingly difficult to leave, it doesn't mean it might not still be the better choice, or a valid option. Perhaps having such regulations and such links between nations is actually a problem and this process is exposing that so much regulation and so many organisations is actually too much?

This is a deeply complex subject and situation we find ourselves in, one which really cannot be summed up by a binary argument of yes/no, love/hate, leave/remain or wrong/right.

I believe we're stronger together, but also that there are some deep rooted issues in both the UK and the EU that require change for us to continue down the best possible path. It requires a lot more effort, critical thinking and open discussion than any politicians on either side has currently given it and I have very little faith they will ever do the situation justice.",True,False,False,,0,1533127856,,False,0,e3eqdyf,False,t3_93nl72,True,t1_e3epape,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/93nl72/people_want_a_proper_say_on_brexit_let_them_have/e3eqdyf/,,1536959409,-1,True,False,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,r/unitedkingdom,public,

False,ReadTheArticleBitch,1531801744.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_1sj151xm,"**Did Real Madrid Coach Julen Lopetegui Really Claim That Gareth Bale Was Going To Replace Ronaldo?**

As soon as the initial shock wore off, attention turned to who Real Madrid would sign to replace Juventus-bound Cristiano Ronaldo.


Robert Lewandowski, Harry Kane, Eden Hazard, Paulo Dybala, Mo Salah, Kylian Mbappé and the ever popular Neymar were all common picks.


Now, four weeks after the story of Ronaldo’s departure broke, there has been no move to splash-the-cash by Real Madrid.  Although the transfer window for Spanish clubs does not close until August 31, there is a growing feeling that the European Champions may opt to go with what they have.


At the press conference before their International Champions Cup game against Manchester United (Manchester United won 2-1), comments expressed by the new Real Madrid Coach reinforced the notion that the checkbook was under lock and key.


Not surprisingly, Lopetegui also fielded questions about the role that Gareth Bale might play for Real Madrid in the new season.  Manchester United has appeared increasingly keen to bring Bale back to the Premier League after he moved to Real Madrid from Tottenham Hotspur in the summer of 2012.


What Lopetegui said about Bale was then creatively edited and it turned into a story of how Bale was to be Ronaldo’s replacement.


Here’s Julen Lopetegui's quote from the press conference:


It is quite clear that Lopetegui views the filling of the void as a squad job and not a responsibility to be thrust on just one player.


Sticking with the existing squad is certainly good news for younger players such as Lucas Vázquez, new arrival Vinícius Júnior and the supremely talented Marco Asensio.


But does anyway really expect that any of these younger players are going to start filling the net on a consistent basis?  Furthermore, looking at the more experienced players it would be quite an achievement if Bale and Karim Benzema in tandem could get even close to the scoring heights hit by Ronaldo on a regular basis.


Since Bale moved to Real Madrid, his goals plus Benzema’s goals have never beaten or matched Ronaldo’s output.


A deeper dive into the statistics shows the scoring hole that the Ronaldo-less Real Madrid has to fill.


Over Ronaldo’s nine seasons at the Estadio Santiago Bernabéu, the Portuguese striker scored just under 33% of Real Madrid’s goals – 450 goals out of a total of 1,376. Ronaldo’s average goals per season were 50 and the team’s total goal output averaged just over 152.


In the three seasons, before he arrived, Real Madrid’s highest tally was 104 and the average was 98. It may be overly simplistic but deduct Ronaldo’s average goals per season from the team average and you get 102 – not far off the average tally of 98 that Real Madrid produced pre-#CR7.


So while Ronaldo was contributing one out of every three goals at an average of 1.03 goals per game for Real Madrid, what was the supporting cast delivering?


Gareth Bale’s best season for Real Madrid was 22 goals in 2013/14. His best goals per game performance came in an injury-scarred 2015/16 season when he scored 19 goals in 31 games – 0.6 goals per game.


It is worth noting that not only did Ronaldo score a lot of goals but he also played a lot of games and showed remarkable resiliency – an average of nearly 48 games per season. He only played less than 44 games in a season once and that was in his first season when he played 35.


Gareth Bale has never made more than 48 appearances in a Real Madrid strip and his average is 38 games a season – 26% less than Ronaldo.


Yes, but didn’t Karim Benzema once score 32 goals in a season for Real Madrid and isn't it possible that he might recover that sort of form?


Benzema did indeed score 32 goals for Real Madrid but it was six seasons ago. He did knock in 28 goals in 15/16 but that was followed by 31 goals in 95 games in his last two seasons.


Benzema comes close to matching Ronaldo’s appearances with 413 games over the same 9 seasons – they both arrived in the summer of 2009. However, his total goals (192) and his average of 0.48 goals per game are not in the same league.


As for the others, Gonzalo Higuaín scored 86 goals in four seasons from 2009 to 2013 before he was sold to Napoli. Alvaro Morata looked to be on verge of becoming a consistent scoring threat with 20 goals in 43 appearances (a good number as a substitute) but he was sold in the summer of 2017 to Chelsea.


If Real Madrid miraculously fills the scoring gap left by Cristiano Ronaldo it will be a phenomenal achievement. But as it stands I’m thinking that Real Madrid fans are going to have a lot fewer goals to cheer this season unless President Florentino Perez issues fresh orders to go forth and find the team another goal scorer.

First off: Frisch didn't set play in real world Andorra, despite the name. Andorra could be any European country/city/town, but in my and many others opinion it's probably heavily inspired by Switzerland and its role in WWII. 

Short introduction to the Plot (fictional), I tried not to spoil anything here: This story revolves around Andri, a boy in a fictional town called Andorra. He's one of few Jews there. The book describes his experiences with the townsfolk and their behavior, which on one hand differs between individuals but on the other hand has many similarities. Andorra at the same time is at the threat of a neighboring antisemitic nation, their members simply called 'blacks' (Frisch drawing on the fascist Italian [Blackshirts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackshirts)), thus kind of a save-haven for Jewish people like Andri, but at the same time he still experiences discrimination there. 

Had to read it in school many years ago, I think almost everyone in the german-speaking part of Switzerland does. Furthermore it's also well known in Germany, I'm not sure about other countries.  
In my opinion, the book is not just well written, but it also invites to reflect upon different things: history, *what if...* type of questions, parallels between things in the book and real world happenings, antisemitism, ostracism, society, ones own behavior as a part of society and more.",True,False,False,,0,1533130462,,False,0,e3esu0b,False,t3_93o16s,True,t3_93o16s,/r/books/comments/93o16s/literature_of_switzerland_august_2018/e3esu0b/,,1536960525,8,True,False,books,t5_2qh4i,r/books,public,

that's got nothing to do with a ""profit motive"" - a profit motive is natural in human beings - it absolutely is - it's just a matter of whether that profit motive is abused by doing very illegal things with politicians - or if it's not illegal, very politically unsightly and unpopular if word gets out 

&gt;Politicians therefore are a service that can help private actors in gaining profit

or they can do this *and* make unions much more powerful which can absolutely destroy certain industries for the sake and power of the bosses on the top...that's why the UK in the 1970s was called the sick man of europe - because their industrial trade unions had a huge grip over the government and it took a very right wing government to finally stop this being the status quo

&gt;This service can be bought in many forms: bribes, lobbying, donations, vote buying, manipulation of media to convince voters, and others that might've slipped my mind.

this can still be done under a socialist government - that's how all social governments in the past operated. 

&gt;I'm not saying that every capitalist state is engaged in crony capitalism, but I do think that crony capitalism is favoured in the same way that low entropy is favoured in closed systems.

I'll level with you - I think crony capitalism sadly exists in most capitalist regimes. in some more than others, of course, and it depends on how you define it; ""democratic corporatism"" in the nordic countries is where big business and trade unions, alongside the government, draft the laws that affect the economy - that's kind of crony capitalism as a matter of institution, but some prefer this than classical pluralism. however, it is a very difficult thing to uproot because money goes to the heart of party politics. but that's going to be the case in socialist democracy too because human beings are always after money. and there will be incentives in socialist governments to have some money concentrated in some hands too. again: all socialist regimes have been this way. they just had the bad faith to not do what they said they'd do. the thing question isn't a matter of ""is socialism better at getting rid of capitalism"" in my opinion, therefore. it's ""what can we do to best stop crony capitalism""? and in my opinion it's about making politics more local, making politicians more accountable (i.e. right to recall politicians who're involved in expenses scandals; we need this in the UK that's for damn fucking sure.), making electoral laws much more transparent (some countries already do this well) such as limits on donations and the publicity of those donations, etc",True,False,False,,1,1533132694,,1533132990,0,e3ev5lk,False,t3_93p0d5,True,t3_93p0d5,/r/changemyview/comments/93p0d5/cmv_i_think_capitalism_favours_crony_capitalism/e3ev5lk/,,1536961615,3,True,False,changemyview,t5_2w2s8,r/changemyview,public,

From the pen of Thomas Jefferson, Paris, 1/16/1787. 

&gt;The tumults in America, I expected would have produced in Europe an unfavorable opinion of our political state. But it has not. On the contrary, the small effect of those tumults seems to have given more confidence in the firmness of our governments. The interposition of the people themselves on the side of government has had a great effect on the opinion here. I am persuaded myself that the good sense of the people will always be found to be the best army. They may be led astray for a moment, but will soon correct themselves. **The people are the only censors of their governors: and even their errors will tend to keep these to the true principles of their institution**. To punish these errors too severely would be to suppress the only safeguard of the public liberty. **The way to prevent these irregular interpositions of the people is to give them full information of their affairs thro’ the channel of the public papers, and to contrive that those papers should penetrate the whole mass of the people**. The basis of our governments being the opinion of the people, the very first object should be to keep that right; and were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter. But I should mean that every man should receive those papers and be capable of reading them. I am convinced that those societies (as the Indians) which live without government enjoy in their general mass an infinitely greater degree of happiness than those who live under European governments. Among the former, public opinion is in the place of law, and restrains morals as powerfully as laws ever did any where. **Among the latter, under pretence of governing they have divided their nations into two classes, wolves and sheep**. I do not exaggerate. This is a true picture of Europe. Cherish therefore the spirit of our people, and keep alive their attention. Do not be too severe upon their errors, but **reclaim them by enlightening them**. If once they become **inattentive to the public affairs, you and I, and Congress, and Assemblies, judges and governors shall all become wolves**. It seems to be the law of our general nature, in spite of individual exceptions; and experience **declares that man is the only animal which devours his own kind, for I can apply no milder term to the governments of Europe, and to the general prey of the rich on the poor**.

Amsterdam is very international, but also very much a tourist city, as has been mentioned. It's a big city like many other so if you're looking to have a good impression of the country itself you won't find it just there. I recommend Maastricht, Nijmegen, Eindhoven and other smaller cities any time. Especially for engineering, Delft and Eindhoven are the places to be since you have the technical universities there. Maybe see if you can do a transfer there. If not, no big deal. What I do think is good is that most dutch people have a good understanding of english (&gt;90%), so you won't have much trouble with communication for your job.

As for your issues with US: from what I've seen I understand your worries, but keep it mind moving elsewhere won't magically make things go away. I think every place has problems of racist, greedy, self centered or just trashy people. It's not specifically a US issue. It's a human one.

The extend of it may differ perhaps. I can't really comment on personal experience so much as I've never lived in the US. Do keep in mind that NL is much more population dense so you won't find huge rural areas in the US where I can imagine some people don't have the best infrastructure or education. There is a 'bible belt', but afaik they don't bother people too much.

And I'm not going to mince words: there's plenty of arguments for migrant control ever since the 70s and this can particularly be taken to the extreme with some trashy people and form xenophobic sentiment. You won't find people in europe showing the same kind of discriminatory remarks as the US or show the same level of obsession with race, but it is there. So keep that in mind. 

Strangely enough, dutch people, despite being raised typically to be humble in their nationalism, do tend to have a kind of pride on the web. In my opinion, the many tales of NL being a super tolerant and highly liberal place are completely excaggerated. 

Feel free to ask anything specific. I'm just trying to not set you up to be dissapointed.

Not always true - it depends on the region and the period that you are looking at. In the case of Europe ex-UK, 57% of active managers (per Morningstar) have beaten the benchmark (after fees) so far this year, and it's been 50% over the last 10 years (after fees). So out of all of the active funds, quite a lot of them have beaten the index over that period.

edit: I forgot to subtract the fees for the Vanguard tracker for the benchmark. Assuming it tracked it perfectly and cost 12bps per year, 86% of active managers outperformed the Vanguard product over the last 10 years.


It's not my place to say whether active or passive is better for any individual. My point is that you cannot say automatically one is better than the other.


Woodford is actually a great example for why you need to do your research properly if looking for an active manager. Lots of people were wowed by his track record but anyone looking at the holdings should have run a mile - it shouldn't be an open-ended vehicle.

Cartilage is a resilient and smooth  elastic tissue, a rubber-like padding that covers and protects the ends of long bones at the joints, and is a structural component of the rib cage, the ear, the nose, the bronchial tubes, the intervertebral discs, and many other body components. It is not as hard and rigid as bone, but it is much stiffer and much less flexible than muscle.The matrix of cartilage is made up of chondrin.

Because of its rigidity, cartilage often serves the purpose of holding tubes open in the body. Examples include the rings of the trachea, such as the cricoid cartilage and carina.

**Stegosauria**

Stegosauria is a group of herbivorous ornithischian dinosaurs that lived during the Jurassic and early Cretaceous periods. Stegosaurian fossils have been found mostly in the Northern Hemisphere, predominantly in what is now North America, Europe and China, though one species (Kentrosaurus aethiopicus) is known to have lived in Africa. Their geographical origins are unclear; the earliest unequivocal stegosaurian, Huayangosaurus taibaii, lived in China.

Stegosaurians were armored dinosaurs (thyreophorans).

***

**Dinosaur**

Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles of the clade Dinosauria. They first appeared during the Triassic period, between 243 and 233.23 million years ago, although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event 201 million years ago; their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. Reverse genetic engineering and the fossil record both demonstrate that birds are modern feathered dinosaurs, having evolved from earlier theropods during the late Jurassic Period.

No, it's not opinion. It's what the statistics tell us. You're conflating objective and subjective interpretations/measurements.

&gt; If you are going to try and convince me of your opinion and I am completely open to being convinced

Again, it's not an opinion. All one has to do is look at numbers. I've been providing articles to source these things (you could even read the one posted by OP!) and yet you seemingly haven't tried to understand this. You keep relying on fantasy stats and 'eye test' and other old-school nonsense that doesn't hold up to empirical scrutiny. You claim you're here with an open-mind, but it doesn't seem it. We were lucky based off our performances. Liverpool/Spurs were better than us and outperformed us. They were/are better teams than us. 

&gt; I expect you to give me a logical estimate of how many points you think each of us should have finished with.

[Here](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/soccer-predictions/premier-league/) is SPI which has us as the 6th best team in England (and 18th in Europe). [Here](https://understat.com/league/EPL) is based on xP (expected points) has us at 6th with 62 pts, which is too low and possibly too simplistic of a measurement which then discounts DDG.  However, what all this indicates is that we were lucky to finish where we did and we relied way too much on our GK; who had the highest save % in a [decade](https://objective-football.blogspot.com/2014/12/the-enlightened-era-2009-2014.html). 

&gt; This is your opinion and not exactly borne out by reality.

Uh, no this is fact based (I even sourced it but since you don't read what I post). Sorry to burst your bubble but you seem to constantly conflate opinion with facts. Goalkeeping is more volatile than striking. 

&gt; Only someone who lacks an argument will need to get personal to cover up for it.

Sorry, but it's frustrating to have my fact based arguments discounted and to hear your repeated ""RINGS ERNEH"" argument.

&gt; Yes, I do think we were better than them in 2017-18.

We definitely finished higher than them! However, we weren't better by an measurable statistic and if you replayed last season 1000x they would most certainly finish above us WAY more often than we finish above them based off performance. They were a better team unfortunately.  

&gt; I expect Liverpool to finish ahead of us this year, but that has no bearing on what happened last year.

They likely will, and we can in part forecast that because of how much better they performed than us last season.

Mini rant time - I get it people, some of the streets around uptown are small and dual sided parking makes things tight. However, driving through them countless times has made me realize, over 3/4 of people on the road have absolutely ZERO sense of how big their vehicle is and how to properly maneuver in tight spaces. 

Now I don't want to come off as some sort of Euro-snob, but the fact is Europeans are miles better than most all of us in the states at judging the size of their car and getting through tight squeezes as lets face it, their streets are nearly all tiny. I drove for a few weeks in Ireland and some of those one lane roads? Holy hell were they *TINY*. The thing was though, you come up to someone and it would end with you passing by tightly, but successfully.

Getting back to here, people who have more than enough room to make two cars abreast work here in uptown wander into the middle of the road because ""oh it's too tight I can't fit I might hit you"". I've gotten death glares for sticking tight to the parked cars on the right (always at a slow and steady rate of speed to be careful), when someone expects you to move over to let them through. No! You can make it, just have a better sense of your car and we both can get through just fine! It's just so annoying when you come up to someone who refuses to move over to allow two cars when they think their car is too big to fit. 

Again this is going to come off as ranty, but still I think more people need to have a better sense of the car around them - will lead to better drivers all around, better parkers, and less accidents. And not that I'm saying ""hurr durr Europeans are great we should be European"", I'm just pointing out that they're understandably much better at the small road thing than we are.

False,[deleted],,,,,,,dark,,,"Right, but by that logic they would say that you hate leaving your children with a functioning government that isn't bankrupt.

It isn't that you don't WANT a balanced budget, social programs are more important to you. I suspect in a world where budgets were balanced, there was a constant surplus and we didn't know what to do with money, they'd be perfectly happy to have a wealth of social programs. For a lot of them, they don't want to leave their children with a bankrupt future and no social programs at all.

Look at places like Greece, facing staggering austerity. A lot of that was caused by rampant spending and an unwillingness to reign in the deficits. That's what happens when spending goes unchecked forever. That's what most conservatives are trying to avoid.

You're being overly simplistic and combative. Consider a room of 20 people. 5 are die hard Liberal-voters, 5 are staunch Conservative-voters. You've got 10 votes to swing. Telling people if they vote Conservative they are heartless and want people to die won't win them over. Look at US or European politics as an example. People are digging trenches BECAUSE of this exact method of labeling and denigrating. If you want to win those 10 over, tell them WHY your policies are better, be prepared to conceded on some points and don't be afraid to reach a compromise. Reasonable people are swayed by reasonable arguments, not combative and immature namecalling.

We need civilized discourse, and that means treating people as human beings with empathy and feelings. Just because they don't prioritize the way you do doesn't mean they are heartless. And just because someone votes Conservative doesn't mean they are encouraging the suffering of people.

In a province with growing debt and a shrinking manufacturing base (which has long been it's largest industry), how do you propose avoiding austerity? Yes, we're fine now, our debt isn't at the point we're unable to function as a government... but we also aren't putting any aside for if those times come. Look at Alberta. They had a BOOMING economy. They were bringing in more money from oil than entire countries earn. They set up a fund to act as a safety net but then kept spending. 20 years later, Norway, earning a fraction from oil, started a fund too. Alberta's is almost empty while Norway has a pension for every man, woman and child. It's over $1 Trillion right now! Alberta could've had that! But they didn't, because they refused to ever tighten the belt. They should've kept a provincial tax and just saved their revenue.

Norway has a really good social policy, but it's also been fairly conservative in a lot of ways. In fact, if you follow their politics, they've been very conservative in the recent past. They've reigned in spending and either cut or didn't increase funding to programs if it meant accessing that fund early. You would have labels their voters as having no empathy, being heartless, enjoying people suffer... but now thanks to the conservative reigning in of spending, they literally never have to worry about it again. The interest on that one fund alone would provide UBI, ODSP, free tuition and pensions for everyone.

My point is you attract more bees with honey than with vinegar, and you'll be happier to boot if you see your fellow Ontarians and your fellow Canadians as peers, not heartless drones. They have a different outlook on how money should be spent RIGHT NOW, not a desire to see people suffer. The sooner you change to that paradigm, the sooner you'll find yourself able to accept their views while still disagreeing with them and finding compromises.

Do you know why the wartime economies of WWII were so strong and able to function? Because we all compromised for the greater good. And as a direct result, the western world saw the greatest growth economically and socially that it ever had in the aftermath. The war ended and for decades we still compromised, we still worked together, and we built stronger countries.

And now look... the West can't help but accuse each other of being traitors to humanity and all of our countries are in universal decline. Our economies are suffering, our politics are fractured....

Buddy Bolden was put down for not knowing enough music theory. The Creoles similarly put down Black musicians like King Oliver. I just don't think ""sophisticated"" is an accurate term for music that was played in bars and the streets, taught largely by oral tradition, oftentimes by men who could not read music.

You mention Jelly Roll Morton, and I want to point out that Morton was a Creole, so he was of a higher racial caste than say Buddy Bolden and King Oliver. Morton likely received more European training. Even so, here are some facts about Morton from wikipedia:

&gt; At the age of fourteen, Morton began working as a piano player in a brothel (or, as it was referred to then, a sporting house). In that atmosphere, he often sang smutty lyrics; he took the nickname ""Jelly Roll"", which was African-American slang for female genitalia, and by extension a lover of same.

just because it isn't new doesn't mean we need more of toxic kits. I wouldn't consider zed to be unfun to play against. there are still ways to deal with him (for example knowing exactly where he will land after pressing R) and seeing his shadows. also he fell of hard late. I agree tho that old nida was a bitch to play against because of her spear, her hitbox and her ability to escape. so now we have zoe. they made so she can fuck you up from even further behind, she has a slow, a long ass stun + damage amplifier, a dodge/gap closer and free random summoners and item actives popping up in lane at lvl 2... oh and unlike for nida, they made her Q an AOE. gragas actually needed to be fed to pop you. zoe can be behind and still do it. but so can others. ornn is another example of a champ being no fun to play against even when he's not complex for one bit. again, I'm not talking about winrates or possible counter picks. pyke is another overloaded champ. dude has so many escapes (and one escape even with some hard cc) that he doesn't even needs to go flash when played top. some champs are just bullshit to play against. 

example: ahri vs corki. ahri has uhm... I don't know... ludens. corki has trinity. both are at the same level and equally farmed. ahri misses Q and E (her bread and butter spells one might think) and corki lands his skills. ahri will fucking rape corki just by pressing R+W and it won't be close. that is the definition of unfun. people should get rewarded for dodging or hitting their shit. but both champs are as old as the problem itself.

I think one of the other big problems is, that everything deals damage. every keystone, every new item... they all just randomly give you extra damage or extra cc or an extra dash (while giving you damage). getting caught back then? there was a slight chance of getting out. getting caught now? you just pop. everything just suddenly has a huge burst.
ever played top as a melee vs no items poppy with aery? yea she just melts you without landing her spells. and she isn't complex either. it's just this random extra damage from all kinds of sources. there is so much shit applying damage that you don't even bother checking the death info because the stuff doesn't fit on it.",True,False,False,,0,1533141707,,False,0,e3f66d8,False,t3_93g9fd,True,t1_e3euy2g,/r/leagueoflegends/comments/93g9fd/experimental_modes_nexus_blitz/e3f66d8/,,1536966768,1,True,False,leagueoflegends,t5_2rfxx,r/leagueoflegends,public,

Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as communistic by its opponents in power? Where is the opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach of communism, against the more advanced opposition parties, as well as against its reactionary adversaries?
Two things result from this fact:
I. Communism is already acknowledged by all European powers to be itself a power.
II. It is high time that Communists should openly, in the face of the whole world, publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the Spectre of Communism with a manifesto of the party itself.
To this end, Communists of various nationalities have assembled in London and sketched the following manifesto, to be published in the English, French, German, Italian, Flemish and Danish languages.
Chapter I. Bourgeois and Proletarians(1)

[German Original]
The history of all hitherto existing society(2) is the history of class struggles.
Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master(3) and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.
In the earlier epochs of history, we find almost everywhere a complicated arrangement of society into various orders, a manifold gradation of social rank. In ancient Rome we have patricians, knights, plebeians, slaves; in the Middle Ages, feudal lords, vassals, guild-masters, journeymen, apprentices, serfs; in almost all of these classes, again, subordinate gradations.
The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones.
Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinct feature: it has simplified class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other — Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.

Totally. I've lived around the world, and I have yet to find a culture where working on yourself is valued outside of one very special culture I'll get to in a minute.

But the US values work first, people second. In the parts of the Middle East where I grew up, it was family/community first, work second. Seems to be the same in many other countries I've visited. Nowhere is ""yourself"" the first priority or a worthy priority.

That is, except with people who travel. This is the one exception I've seen to everywhere I've lived. People who prioritize traveling over work, over stability, over money. What can we call them? Journeypeople. People who go places and experience things as their primary mode of being. People on journeys.

They seek out people who are different from them, and then they seek out the parts of those different people that are similar to them. They make connections with others, they open up vulnerably about their histories, they validate each other.

Everyone who travels understands that in order to travel a lot, you sacrifice other things, that your parents/family/friends might find you strange, that you are breaking with the dominant paradigm of your culture, whatever culture that is.

because China stopping foreign investment is their problem, not ours. If China wants to pump their capital into Germany or Europe that's great news for us, it means that we're an attractive location to invest. 

That China closes off its own domestic market only hurts China. The Chinese government picking who gets to win and lose on their market just keeps uncompetitive business alive and robs Chinese people of opportunities.

I've lived in Europe for several years now (returning to C later this year), So I only get CNN international, Stream CBC, and watch UK, Dutch &amp; German news. As I see it North American news (even the ""good ones"") become more and more entrenched in their own narratives, its less on CBC but visible. (My realization of this was when Russia shot down MH17 and CNN provided a false translation that supported their narrative but when on Dutch TV it clearly stated something different.) And often I spot bias and falseness in the media on all sides. 


The problem isn't that people are listing to one source, its that sources are consolidating their narrative, reporting without researching and different echo chambers emerge which people stick within (so not one account, but a group that all say the same). So I dont think people take a singular source (but definitely they get stuck in echo chambers where multiple sources tell them the same thing) &amp; I don't think this is the case for this scenario. The twitterpage has a target on it, if it reports anything blatantly false (rather then the current Ford shook the PM's hand, then the policie chiefs hand, this is what i want to do...) then news/radio/tv outlets are going to call him out and people are going to know.

You see my point here, right? That's not all just puritanism. Yes, some countries are OK with exposed breasts. And I have no problem with that! France, Spain, the Scandinavian countries (if you're brave enough to go topless in the near-arctic), a number of African countries, some South American countries, a few places in Meso-America, some Southeast Asian countries... they exist. The culture there is a lot more open about that. Admittedly a number of those places are not great argument in this context, as the debate was about ""are breasts sexy"" which is still true in most of those places, but yes, even in some countries where breasts are seen as sexual, you can see them on TV, on beaches, in movies, etc. You won't see people walking around topless usually, but it is technically legal to do so.

If you live in America, though, that does not apply. The culture here is to remain covered. You may like that or not, but that's the way it is, and arguing ""well but other people do it differently in other places"" is arguing in bad faith. Obviously other people all over the world do things differently from us. That doesn't make us more right or them more right. All it means is that we're different and diverse.

Whether you think it is or not, this argument is about culture, it is about about taboo, and cultural relativism does apply.

As a side note:

I'm confused by how you can think a culture can be ""wrong"" on something like fashion or taste. That argument is always one I've heard from more right-wing people, and it's one I've always disagreed with. You, however, seem to be pretty left-wing yet still are coming from the same view: that somehow one culture's ideas can be superior to another's on issues as subjective as food, clothing, manners, or fashion.

I don't get it. Maybe you don't put toplessness in the same category, but it seems to me to be pretty cut and dry: that falls under the umbrella of social mores regarding appropriate fashion, and judging cultures' fashion to be ""right"" or ""wrong"" has strong imperialist, right-wing undertones.",True,False,False,,0,1533145923,,1533148075,0,e3fbkut,False,t3_93ebmv,True,t1_e3ew7cz,/r/SubredditDrama/comments/93ebmv/user_posts_a_photo_of_googlyeyes_pasted_above_a/e3fbkut/,,1536969283,1,True,False,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,r/SubredditDrama,public,

It is the people that voted for all these buffoons over the last 30 years (probably even more). It was completely obvious that SYRIZA wouldn't and couldn't keep their stupid preelection promises, and if people are that stupid to believe every lie that comes from the opposition (and every opposition that I have experienced), then they should refrain from voting.

Democracy works only when the voters think, self-reflect and self-criticize their choice before voting again, but this is not the case with the average Greek voter. Instead they just blindly vote for the one that promises more money. In the end people get the politicians that they deserve, politicians that will spew whatever lie gets them elected. It is the responsibility of the citizens to filter the liars, otherwise as we say in Greece only the crap and the corks stay afloat.

While SYRIZA did destroy the economic prospect of Greece by at least 5-10 years, due to the ridiculous macho negotiations with the EU, at least it seems to me that top level corruption is lower compared to previous governments. Do you really think that New Democracy would govern better, especially since they are at least half to blame for this mess that they created all these past years together with PASOK?

False,TheBassCave,1302368843.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_52wo2,"&gt;How do you think this season will go?

I think that any suggestion that we'll bother the European places is extremely premature and a bottom half finish is more likely. 

I have some sympathy with Manuel Pellegrini  -  the squad was in a terrible state when he arrived and he had little option other than to rip it up and start again - but changing so much in one go rarely works out well in the short term. Combine that with a radical shift in playing style for our existing players, the inevitable adjustment period of a new manager, and a relatively short pre-season and you've got a recipe for a very disjointed start.

The other concern is that, for all the money that spent in this window, we've not really addressed our major issues from the last two years. We had the worst defensive record in the league last season and that stemmed largely from both the lack of structure and the lack of a mobile destructive player in midfield which left our backline exposed on a regular basis. Rather than rectifying that, the club have instead signed three quarters of a new back four and a new goalkeeper, which feels like a case of treating the symptoms of a problem rather than the cause.

The spine of the team is still devoid of pace and quite limited in possession, so it's hard to see how we're going to play the type of possession-based football that Pellegrini wants -  it's nice to have players who are effective in the final third but they're not going to have much impact if we struggle to get the ball to them regularly. We're in a situation yet again where Mark Noble pretty much has to start as he's the only one of our current CM options who can reliably link midfield and defence. For all of his merits, if West Ham truly want to kick on to the next level, we can't be in a position where Nobes is an undisputed starter.

There are a handful of midtable clubs who have either recruited for their needs better than we have or are simply further along in their building process compared to us with an established manager and settled style of play. I think we'll need to be patient while Pellegrini instils his ideas on this team and essentially treat it as a transition year. As long as the football isn't utterly fucking miserable to watch and there are signs the groundwork is being laid for future success, I don't really care where we end up in the league table.

&gt;Which player is going to be star of the season and why?

Arthur Masuaku. There were glimpses of it last season, but his dribbling brings another dimension to this team and, if everything clicks, he could be a real difference maker on the overlap in a side that's otherwise a little short on width. The early signs of his link up with Anderson down the left have been encouraging and if he can help pin opposition wingers back with his forward runs, that'll help compensate for his defensive deficiencies.

&gt;How do you think the team will lineup

Based on the friendlies so far, it'll be a 4-3-3. The 3 in midfield will be quite fluid, with one player screening and one of the more advanced CMs pushing on to support the striker when we have the ball. The most likely starting XI atm seems to be:

Fabianski

Fredericks/ Balbuena/Ogbonna/Masuaku

Noble/Rice/Wilshere

Yarmolenko/Arnautović/Anderson

Balbuena appears to be favoured ahead of Diop for the time being and if Obiang sticks around he'll presumably play in games where we need to be robust/when Wilshere is unavailable. Javier Hernández is the wildcard - he's supposedly been promised a more significant role but he's been on holiday since the World Cup so no-one knows exactly how he fits in.

When Lanzini is back he'll slot into the midfield 3 and make this team an entirely different proposition. We'll miss him badly while he's out.

We give all our port traffic to the Netherlands. They give all their investment banking to the City of London. Fair, right? 

Except that the economist Paul Krugman was predicting as early as 1993 that this was going to cause serious political problems. He [wrote] (http://www.nber.org/papers/w4559):

&gt; The political difficulties posed by this adjustment problem are obvious. European nations may be enthusiastic about the benefits of economic integration in the abstract. But when it turns out that such integration involves losses as well as gains, and in particular that the **geographic consolidation of industries means that some national industries vanish**, the charges of ""social dumping"" are sure to fly. 

This explains why the North voted so heavily for Brexit. Their industries were given away so London could be the EU's equivalent of New York. 

Our decision to narrow our economy to financial services also means that when a financial crash occurs, as it did in 2008, we're especially screwed.

Maybe some don't know what CQ VT or CQ DX or CQ EU mean.

Along those thoughts, I went back and re-read the IARU's ""etiquette guide"" by ON4UN &amp; ON4WW, and found this (noting particularly the last bullet):

&gt;**II.8.2. What does ‘CQ DX’ mean?**.  
&gt;• If you want to contact long distance stations, call ‘*CQ DX*’.  
&gt;• What is **DX**?

&gt;• On VHF-UHF: stations located at more than approx. 300 km.  
&gt;• During a CQ you can insist that you only want to work DX stations, as follows: ‘*CQ DX, outside Europe, this is...*’.  
&gt;• Always be obliging; maybe the local station calling you after your CQ DX is a newcomer, and maybe you are a new country for him. Why not just give him a quick QSO?

It’s steady as she goes for the Fed this time around, as many investors had pretty much baked in. After a June hike of the benchmark  federal-funds rate to a range between 1.75% and 2%, the Fed concluded this week’s meeting Wednesday by standing pat and keeping rates right there.


The economy continues to look healthy by most measures, the Fed’s statement said, but rate policy remains “accommodative” to support what the Fed called “ strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2% inflation.” Still, the Fed arguably seems to be preparing investors for a possible rate hike by the time of its next meeting in September.


The Fed sees risks to the economy as “roughly balanced,” and said  that “further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term.”


The statement was relatively short, leaving the impression that the Fed doesn’t have much new to say, at least not this time around. Just two weeks ago Fed Chairman Jerome Powell testified to Congress and laid out a similar set of remarks. The vote to keep rates unchanged was unanimous.


There really wasn’t much new insight from the Fed on Wednesday, at least not much that we haven’t heard before. The market continues to look for direction, but didn’t get too much from Powell and company.


The S&amp;P 500 Index was down going into the Fed’s announcement and sank further after the news. Still, it remained above the 2800 level where technical analysts see psychological support. Meanwhile, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, which hit 3% earlier in the day, traded at 2.99% in the minutes after the Fed statement. The two-year yield gained slightly on the 10-year, narrowing the spread between them.


The question heading into the meeting was less whether the Fed would hike (the futures market pegged odds at below 2%) and more about where rates might ultimately be headed. The Fed continues to indicate that it plans to raise rates in a way that keeps pace with a strengthening economy but not to levels where they might weaken growth. Where that “neutral” level might be remains a subject of debate.


The Fed’s challenge is to raise rates and inflation back toward historical norms without steering the economy into a recession due to higher borrowing costs. Remember, the Fed has a “dual mandate” of full employment and monetary stability, and right now, unemployment has been quite low and inflation has stayed in check. Whether this positive mix can continue remains to be seen. The Fed has pointed out tariffs as one possible impediment to growth, and any sign of overheating in the economy that moves the inflation dial could put pressure on the Fed to hike rates more quickly.


In June, the Fed’s “dot plot” predicted rates of 3.1% by the end of 2019, up a bit from the Fed’s 2.9% median estimate of a so-called “neutral” rate which neither supports nor slows the economy. The same dot plot expected rates to rise to 3.4% by the end of 2020.


However, Fed Chair Powell signaled that if the economic ship sails into any rocks along the way, perhaps due to factors beyond the Fed’s control such as tariff policy, the Fed might slow the rate of increase. Analysts note it could work the other way as well, Bloomberg News reported, meaning if the recent tax cuts stimulate faster-than-expected growth, the Fed might have to tighten more quickly.


With Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) prices up 2.2% year-over-year as of June, inflation appears to remain just above the Fed’s stated 2% target. However, the Fed has signaled it might let inflation run a little hot in an effort to avoid choking economic growth. With the economy growing 4.1% in Q2, the current rate regime doesn’t appear to be cutting off demand as of yet. However, the housing sector has struggled lately as prices rise and mortgages get more pricey, possibly a sign of higher borrowing costs starting to have an impact. Other economic data, however, continue to look mostly strong.


Now that the Fed’s decision is out, futures prices at the CME point to 90% odds of a rate hike by the time of the Fed’s next meeting in September, and a 66% chance of a fourth rate hike by the end of the year. Those odds are little changed from before the conclusion of this week’s meeting.


Empty Podium: This is going to be one of the very last Fed meetings to conclude without a press conference. Earlier this year, Fed Chair Jerome Powell announced that starting in 2019, press conferences will accompany each Federal Open Market Committee meeting, and that could arguably cause more volatility. Every time a Fed chairman speaks, especially when it’s a Q&amp;A with the media or Congress, it raises the potential that he or she might say something market-moving. So enjoy the relative peace after this FOMC meeting, because someday you might look back fondly.


Target Practice: The Fed funds target rate is now between 1.75% and 2%, with the futures market expecting it to rise to between 2% and 2.25% by September. That puts rates at levels where the Fed historically has liked to see them, roughly between 2% and 5%. The question is how long this might last. It’s been a while since the Fed was able to keep rates in that range for long. For a year-and-a-half between late 2004 and mid-2006, rates climbed from 2% to 5%, but went over 5% in June 2006. Some people look back on the 1990s as a time of economic growth and strong stock markets, but rates were mostly above 5% for most of that period.


Some Fed watchers argue that the so-called “neutral” interest rate might be lower now than in the past, but where exactly that is remains to be seen. Somewhere around 3% (the Fed’s current estimate) might be in the realm of possibility. The Fed’s “dot plot” sees rates reaching that level in 2020, but a lot can happen in two years.


Foreign Cuisine: The U.S. economy weighs heavily in the Fed’s rate decisions, but the background drumbeat of foreign economic performance also plays a big role. At this point, China’s growth engine seems to be encountering some headwinds, and the Shanghai Composite index is down more than 14% year-to-date. The Euro Stoxx 50 Index is also treading water this year, barely up at all since Jan. 1. Both the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) voted to keep rates unchanged at their recent meetings. That means the strong U.S. economy is a bit of an outlier. With German 10-year bund rates below 0.5%, there’s a wide gap with the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which touched 3% Wednesday. The Fed probably doesn’t want U.S. rates to diverge too widely from rates abroad, but it also doesn’t want inflation to get a foothold here. As you can see, Chairman Powell and company have a narrow tightrope to walk.

False,PeeweeTheMoid,1328629929.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_6v2d1,"We need to draw distinction between Greek and Roman naming. Herodotus, as you say, exclusively uses the name Libya.
In book 2 of the *Histories*, he argued that the Nile Delta does not divide ""Asia and Libya"" by this argument:
&gt; ""If, then, my judgment is correct, the Ionians are mistaken in their opinions about Egypt; if, on the other hand, the Ionians are right, I am ready to prove that neither they not the rest of the Greeks know how to count: for they hold that the world consists of three parts – Asia, Europe, and Libya – whereas it is obvious that they should add a fourth, namely the Egyptian Delta, since they do not include it in either Asia or Libya. (2.16, trans. Aubrey de Selincourt, 1954)

Interestingly, this three continent notion persisted. Isidore of Seville, writing around AD 630, stated that 
&gt; For this surrounding Ocean flows around in a circle at all boundaries. However, it is divided into three parts: from which one part is Asia, another Europe, and a third called Africa. 

&gt; Vndique enim Oceanus circumfluens eius in circulo ambit fines. Divisus est autem trifarie: e quibus una pars Asia, altera Europa, tertia Africa nuncupatur. (Etymologiae 14)

But this isn't an apples to apples comparison by any means. When you look at contemporaries, you find that Greeks and Romans used different names for the same place for centuries.

The Romans used a term with varied etymological explanations, variously Latinate, Hebraic, or originating in a local name. The Romans associated it with the Carthaginians and the continent generally, according to [Lewis &amp; Short](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=Africa&amp;la=la&amp;can=africa0&amp;prior=in#lexicon). The Greeks' name derives from their ethnonym for the people living on the west bank of the Nile, according to the [Great Scott](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=*libu%2Fh&amp;la=greek&amp;can=*libu%2Fh0&amp;prior=h\(#lexicon).

When Polybius was writing his history of the Punic Wars in the 2nd century BC, he used the term Libya exclusively to describe activities taking place on that continent. But when the Romans added Carthage's territory to their growing empire, they named it Africa Proconsolaris (not Libya). And Cornelius Scipio's honorific agnomen was ""Africanus"" not based in ""Libya."" 

Furthermore, when Titus Livius described these same events in Latin one hundred years later, he described the same events using ""Africa"" exclusively. In the second and first century BC, we see Greeks using ""Libya"" for all land west of the Nile, and Romans using ""Africa"" to describe the same territory. Sallust used ""Africa"" for the continent as well, in his *[Jugurthine War](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Sal.%20Jug.%2089.7&amp;lang=original)*. Throughout antiquity from Africanus down to Diocletian's designation of Diocese Africa and Justinian's reassertion of the territory as Prefectura Africa. To the Romans, the territory west of Egypt was Africa.

The Greeks persisted in using ""Libya"" in their language. 
Claudius Ptolemy (d. AD 170), the Alexandrian founder of Geography, used the Libya name as well. ""First of all, therefore, let us set down Europe which we separate from Libya by the Straits of Hercules..."" ([Prologue](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Periods/Roman/_Texts/Ptolemy/2/Prologue*.html) to *Geography*). Procopius likewise used ""Libya"" in the *[Secret History](https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/basis/procop-anec.asp)* (c. AD 550). So while Justinian was reestablishing the province as Africa, Procopius was describing the event using the term Libya, parallel to Polybius describing the Romans' conquest of Carthaginian Africa. 

Muslim invaders adopted the Prefecture name, and it appears on maps consistently after the 7th century.

The links explicitly show how the US [**knowingly**](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-12-15/weapons-went-cia-isis-less-two-months-new-study-reveals) carried out a regime change operation that resulted in terrorists being armed as a result of the US and its allies arming the rebels. ISIS got a massive influx of **new weapons** thanks to US policies, this is not debatable, it's in the report.

That you try to equate this with the rebels having some Russian weapons they got through attacking government positions is beyond obtuse. The US armed terrorist linked rebels directly as a policy, US weapons didn't just happen to be found by them.

Furthermore, from the report:

&gt; Moreover, many of these transfers have violated the terms of sale and export agreed between weapon exporters—primarily EU Member States—and recipients in Saudi Arabia and the United States. These are clear cases of diversion, whereby government recipients have broken end-user agreements in which they undertook not to re-export weapons or ammunition without the prior consent of exporting governments. 

&gt; These non-retransfer clauses are explicitly designed to mitigate the risk of diversion and the subsequent use of weapons by insurgent and terrorist forces to the detriment of international peace and security. Their violation runs counter to a range of international and regional counter-diversion agreements, including specific aspects of the Arms Trade Treaty and the EU Common Position on Arms Exports.

While there are social fictions with utility (eg. money and language), race is more in the realm of abstract social fiction than utility.  But if instead you believe that they are all equal, you will have to consider race as important as money and language, and that would logically follow the belief that race is somehow a building block of civilization itself, considering the importance of money and language in that role.

TL;DR - That's the rebuttal that can be used.  Basically, there are constructs that have utility, but then there are those that are so abstract as to not have much utility outside of taxonomy.

There's too much mention of things like the Brightdroids and Subliming for the audience to form any sort of attachment towards. 

The other major issue is that you seem to have a need to explain every aesthetic detail of the OT in the Prequels. Nobody really cares about bulky data tapes versus technologically-advanced AI systems. If you had some backwater planets be more analog, and the Core Worlds more digital, then *maybe* it could serve as a symbol for classism or whatever, but as it stands, several writers just end up spending too much time on needless worldbuilding exposition than developing the characters. 

Other than that, it's a well-developed imaginative recreation of the prequels.

A lot has been said so far but here's my take

In 1798 Jeremy Benthem, a renowned philosopher posed the problem as such - “The question is not, Can they reason?, nor Can they talk? but, Can they suffer? Why should the law refuse its protection to any sensitive being?”

So I think the question is, considering animals feel pain, and considering the pain they feel is just as real to them as ours is to us, don't they deserve moral consideration? 

And if so, aren't their lives worth more than our taste buds?

Fundamentally this line of reasoning is why I myself avoid animal exploitation. 

I also HIGHLY reccommend this video - it's 18 minutes but it's a brilliant deconstruction of how societies relationship with food by a psychologist and activist, Harvard graduate Dr Melanie Joy

“There’s absolutely no reason to suppose that they (animals such as chimps, dogs, cows) feel less pain than we do”

* Environmental concerns - ""Avoiding meat and dairy products is the single biggest way to reduce your environmental impact on the planet, according to the scientists behind the most comprehensive analysis to date of the damage farming does to the planet.
The new research shows that without meat and dairy consumption, global farmland use could be reduced by more than 75% – an area equivalent to the US, China, European Union and Australia combined – and still feed the world. Loss of wild areas to agriculture is the leading cause of the current mass extinction of wildlife.""

I guess she kind of earned this self-cofidence by the prices she has won but it does not sound too sympatic in my ears.
I personally think that there are good ways to get known outside the classic publishing business IF you are brilliant. 
I prefer eurpean-based fantasy myself because i think that the structure of medival european society is a pretty good frame for telling engaging stories because of the personal relationships of feudalism. It is also easier for a reader to get used to a story if the backround is easily understandable. 
A fantasy story based on a more foreign mythologie has to explain its backround much more carfully to keep the focus of the reader. So it might be true that it requires a better author to write such a story.

The constant claim of racism does not help the cause although i personally believe that their is some racism still in modern societies i don`t believe that this is the reason for the focus on european based fantasy. I just think that the potential of a totally economic failure is bigger if you sell mediocore books about unknown cultures because weaker writing is much more obvious if you have to explain the base of your worldbuildung to the audience.

I just read a book about chinese history because i wanted to know the historic personalities in the three body problem but not you will need some interest to history to do that. Otherwise some passages of the book remain more mysterious than they should be just because the reader does not have enoguh knowledge of the backround.

I'm a firefighter/paramedic.   I consciously choose that career because i DIDN'T want to lay in bed at night wondering what the hell i was doing with my life.   Yeah I'll never live the high life, but I'll be ok. 

But in my work i see so many chronic diseases that are what some call diseases of despair.   They are caused by things like poor diet, smoking, drug abuse, unprotected sex, and other reckless behavior, etc that make no sense if you have a hope for a better life, but make a certain kind of sense if you expect your life is going to be one long miserable slide into the darkness. 

And i think I've seen a gradual expansion up the socioeconomic scale from people who have been on the dole for generations, to young college educated people. 

And on one level it makes a kind of sense.  Faith in the ""American Dream"" and institutions has fallen as more and more people don't trust those in power to play fair. 

Europe is a little way ahead of us on this.   After the two world wars destroyed the continent, people sort of gave up on most institutions.   That may not be a bad thing.   They focus more on trying to live good lives, and design societies that encourage that. 

We're in an awkward transition where we're going from being kings of the world to just one more disillusioned prodigal.  

But as George Carlin said, inside every cynic is a disappointed idealist.   And in a weird way, i hope your generation can find common cause in your disillusionment and use that to advance the human condition within our society.   Things DON'T have to be this way, NO ONE lives forever, and there's ALWAYS a better way. 

Good luck, hang in there, and don't be afraid to make a radical change to your life.   In a strange way, having so many options for finding happiness can make you unhappier.  It's like when you go to the grocery store and spend 30 minutes dithering about which of the fifty types of peanut butter is best.  You get into decision fatigue,  FOMO, that sort of thing.

*Europe had been overpopulated before the plague, and a reduction of 30 to 50 percent of the population could have resulted in higher wages and more available land and food for peasants because of less competition for resources [...] initial outbreak of the Black Death had a leveling effect that changed the ratio of land to labor, reducing the value of the former while boosting that of the latter, which lowered economic inequality by making landowners and employers less well off while improving the lot of the workers. He states that ""the observed improvement in living standards of the laboring population was rooted in the suffering and premature death of tens of millions over the course of several generations.""

It's always news about intolerance, war, racism or the absolute abandonment of the poor. While these may be unfortunate parts of the USA, there is much more to it. Thankfully, there are also shows that show the flipside. There's a show in my country about a young man cycling through the United States and talking to people about their country along the way. It's shows like these that hopefully help my fellow countrymen to realize that there are also many kind, level-headed and wonderful people in the USA.

&gt; Two examples that I saw were active recruitment in the streets of Gothenburg by the Nordic Front (nazis), and I was in Gothenburg when a synagogue was firebombed near my hotel.
&gt; I have also experienced situations where professionals have said bigoted things that would never be accepted in a US work environment.

These aren't relatable to me as a Belgian. There's obviously racism here, plenty of it. There's racism everywhere. Still, I don't think we take freedom of speech so literally. There's a political participation ban on hatemongering and racism. We had a fairly popular political party being accused of racism by a court and being prohibited from further political participation. Any kind of racism is big news here, especially if it's public. We even have an antiracism law since 1981 which can be condensed into three parts :

* It's punishable to encourage racism, racial segregation, hate or violence against a group of people based on their skin colour, heritage or nationality.
* It's punishable to publizice an intent towards discrimination, racial segragation, hate or violence against a group of people based on their skin colour, heritage or nationality.
* It's punishable to cooperate or participate with an organisation which repeatedly has announced or executed discrimination or racial segregation.

There are more laws like this, but that's the most important one. These type of laws aren't that uncommon in Western Europe or Scandinavia as far as I know. I honestly think that equality of all living beings and the secularisation of government are two values most heavily supported and seen as quintessentially European by Europeans themselves.

On the fundamental question? It doesn't seem that way, polling hasn't dramatically shifted one way or another if you ask whether the UK should or shouldn't be in the EU after all.

&gt;Practicality and efficiency of decision-making have always been wolf-whistles to dictatorship.

And they have been the basis of democracy too. 

&gt; (If May can call a needless general election for something as inappropriate and unhelpful as party politics then she can also call a second referendum.)

She can, but there is no particularly compelling reason I can see why she would want to, or why it'd be a good thing for her to do so, the calls are broadly coming from one side of the argument (unlike for the initial referendum) and it's questionable whether there is even anything close to majority support for an in/out referendum at all.

Moreover if we end up with a leave vote anyway (which seems fairly likely), all it does is increase uncertainty in the interim, if it leads to a remain vote, you still need parliament to accept it and act. Not to mention that to even run the referendum we'd need legislation, a campaign period and everything else that goes with it  At that point, and given that people are actively lobbying parliament anyway. it'd probably make sense just to let Parliament make any necessary decisions. 

&gt;If delaying or derailing the exit process is what the people want then they should be allowed to express those views. Not silenced by the Brexit 'majority'.

Absolutely, but it doesn't really seem like that is what a majority of people want. Again, before the EU referendum, support for having it went above 80%, I haven't seen a poll suggesting that even close to 50% want another in/out referendum..

&gt;But the Brexit crowd tried to say that Parliament needn't be involved and have consistently attempted to sideline it from any decision-making process or oversight.

I don't think anyone suggested that Parliament needn't be involved, because that'd be absurd. Parliament would need to legislate regardless.  There was an argument that the Government didn't need Parliamentary consent to start the exit process, but obviously that was shown to be wrong and Parliament has been involved..  And if Parliament wants to act on this it can.

&gt;Brexit is a process being imposed on the British people through a tyranny of a slim majority from over 2 years ago to satisfy the illusory desires of some and the very real unpatriotic desires of the upper classes.

The UK is leaving the EU because we had an advisory referendum which returned a slim majority for leave, which was followed by Parliament acting on that advice, followed by a General election that resulted in the election (by a slim margin) of a formally pro-Brexit government, and a formally pro-Brexit opposition. 

As to the motivations for the vote, you may not agree, and you may not like them, but I would be willing to bet that most people (leave and remain) voted for what they felt was best for the country, I'd be wary of labelling my opposition of being unpatriotic, and indeed of misunderstanding motivations to the point of assuming that they were illusory.

&gt; Shakatak is an English jazz-funk band, founded in 1980.

&gt; Shakatak scored a number of chart entries, including two Top Ten hits in the UK Singles Chart, ""Night Birds"" (1982) and ""Down on the Street"" (1984), plus a further 12 entries in the Guinness book of British Hit Singles. The group are still active and popular throughout the world, particularly in Japan and the Far East, and generally produce a new album every two years on JVC Records.

&gt; From their first release in August 1980, (the Bill Sharpe composition ""Steppin'"" on the Polydor record label), and their first album, Drivin' Hard, the band's singles and albums have entered the charts regularly.

&gt; It was the release of ""Easier Said Than Done"" that gave the band the radio exposure needed for their first top-twenty hit. This record introduced their instrumental-unison vocal sound to a much wider audience, and the track stayed in the UK chart for seventeen weeks. The follow-up, ""Night Birds"", was their first single to reach the top ten, and the album of the same name gave Shakatak their first gold album, entering at number four and remaining in the charts for twenty-eight weeks. By now a major international act, the success of the release gave them the number-one jazz album slot in Japan, and attracted interest across Europe and South America. Night Birds was used in the feature film ""Away We Go"" directed by Sam Mendes and was used as the demonstration song on many Casio Piano Keyboards such as the Casio CT-460.

&gt; Two more albums – Invitations and Out of This World – were recorded in 1982 and 1983, resulting in several more chart hits, and paving the way for the next major breakthrough in the band's career. With a subtle change in musical direction, yet still retaining the band's identity, Jill Saward (formerly of Fusion Orchestra, Brandy and Citizen Gang) became their lead singer to make Shakatak's fifth album, Down on the Street. The resulting single releases ""Down on the Street"" and ""Watching You"" had great success, and brought them attention in new parts of the world. The following year saw the release of the group's first live album, which was recorded in both Tokyo and London.

&gt; The seventh album, Day by Day, saw the development of songwriting by all of the band members. In 1986 Saward announced that she was expecting a baby later the same year. This news allowed the band to ease their hectic touring schedule for a while, and enabled them to concentrate purely on recording for a brief period. The band were in the top five foreign acts in Japan, and after winning the coveted Silver Award in the Tokyo International Song Festival, Shakatak were asked to produce an extra album each year exclusively for the Japanese market. By this time they had two extra albums released there entitled Into the Blue and Golden Wings. Both sold well, the latter winning the ""Best Instrumental Album 1987"" at the Japanese Phonograph Record Association Awards.

&gt; However, following this success the band felt it was time that they re-directed their efforts back to singles, and an album for release to the rest of the world. The result was Something Special, closely followed by the night club and chart hit ""Mr Manic &amp; Sister Cool"" from their next LP, Manic and Cool.

&gt; In the 1990s, the band had success in the US when they had two albums that went to No 1 in the contemporary jazz charts, and were also awarded the Japanese grammy for best international instrumental album six years running.

&gt; Shakatak continue to appear regularly throughout the world with recent festival performances at Jakjazz, the Jakata International Jazz Festival, Bangkok, Hua Hin and the Bratislava Jazz Day and they make annual appearances at the Billboard Clubs in Japan and the Pizza Express Jazz Room in London plus numerous other concert and club performances.

&gt; The band celebrated their thirtieth anniversary year in 2010.

&gt; Bassist George Anderson is to release his second solo album 'Expressions' on the 3rd September 2012 through Secret Records. Coming three years after his first album 'Positivity', this album again sees George writing, arranging and producing all of the tracks on it.

&gt; Keyboardist Bill Sharpe worked with American jazz pianist Don Grusin on a joint project called Geography released in 2007. Sharpe's second collaboration with Grusin, Trans Atlantica has been completed and is to be released on the 3rd September 2012. This is to be released through London label Secret Records and will also include their first album Geography as a special 2-CD package. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt;Oriental trousers differ very much in different countries. They are of all possible widths, from wide pantaloons, which are only drawn together at the bottom over the feet, to close-fitting shapes which look more like drawers and indeed are so-called by European travellers. The are also of very different lengths, from knee-breeches, especially for soldiers, to long trousers coming to below the feet. Colours were dependent not only on fashion (at times, only natural colours were considered chic, and artifical colours not at all)...As regards material, a famous Persian speciality was silken trousers; in Egypt and the adjoining lands, the white Egyptian linen was popular, trousers of red leather are mentioned as the dress of the women in the market of lights at Cairo, and so on.

If you go googling for more on sirwal, do *not* go to any site referring to Punjab, Pakistan, or India: those are all modern styles of sirwal, and are **not** period at all. Also, the ""poofy"" sirwal gathered at the ankle are almost all post-period; the only ""gray area"" ""poofies"" are Turkish. And ""harem pants"" are right out.

If you get something out of these books, then that's great - seriously.


*Hard Contact* is perfectly enjoyable, even though I'd have preferred something closer to the game. The characterisatation *actually works* in it because of the setting - they're all behind enemy lines and Etain hasn't had any forwarning of clones and leadership and so on. And there's a vilainous Mandolorian, which fits into the rest of the EU quite nicely and serves to bridge the gap to the Mando PoV a bit more gracefully. Oh, and all of the repetative 'as Skirata had taught them', 'as Skirata said' etc. lines actually work as the clones just have training and Geonosis to fall back on.



Then we get to *Tripple Zero*. I think the main issue with it is actually that the characters just don't fit the plot. (Terroist attacks on Coruscant? Call Jax Pavan, he'll sort it). *Hard Contact* could work as a mission in the game, with minor modification. *Tripple Zero*, though? Not so much.


*Tripple Zero* also, notably, is when Skirata appeared in the story himself. And he takes it over completely, to the point that the titular Republic Commandos are tertiary characters behind Skirata and his edgey 'private army'. And there are *so very many* clone main characters with the exact same personality - really ironic considering how much Traviss pushes the 'clones are individuals' line.


*Tripple Zero* also suffers from being set a year after *Hard Contact* in that no changes in characterisation seem to have ocurred over the interim - is Etain now a confident, self assured Knight? No, she's exactly the same as ever.


Traviss and her characters are at her best when away from authority, but the means by which they're placed there are often very clumsy. 

Her portrayals of other people's characters are universally awful, and any Jedi in her books frankly do not belong in the Order. 

Oh, and she's also proof that female authours can be really sexist (all authority figures in all her books are male).

Etain Tur-Mukan is again a primary example. The narrative (and Skirata) constantly comment on how surprising it is she can do anything considering how 'small', 'young' and 'inexperienced' she is (read: they're surprised a woman can do anything), despite the fact that everything she does is either because a male character has told her to (including *giving up her child* to be raised as a soldier, the *exact same* upbringing she says is 'wrong' when done to the clones) or because she's seeking male validation.

All her other female characters are either waitresses, dancers, secretaries or 'femme fatale' types.

False,gradeplg,1502306668.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_9y4piob,"&gt;The comment I replied to was not about all gun violence. Mass shootings were mentioned, specifically, as occurring far less in countries with stricter gun laws, which, although technically true, is a misguided statement that fails to understand what the statistics really mean. The fundamental problem with the statement, “These kinda of shootings don’t happen in other countries,” boils down to two things:
1.	⁠The US is fucking huge, far larger both geographically and by population than any individual nation in the EU. Regardless of what the numbers actually say, it should be obvious that the US experiences more deaths by mass public shootings than any individual EU nation.
2.	⁠When we compare deaths by mass shootings in individual countries in the EU to individual states in the US, we see that comparably-sized populations in Europe and in the US experience comparable levels of mass public shootings.

Well let's also not ignore some things.

1. Europe has been targeted much more by foreign terror attacks (partially due to the fact they are simply closer to the Middle East) so their statistics are inflated.

2. That doesn't address my criticism of deaths being a bad way to measure things. Certainly there are quite a few places in the US that are experts at saving victims of gun violence because of the frequency with which it occurs there. Certainly they are more likely to save a victim than doctor in Europe that could be considered relatively inexperienced. 

3. Most European nations have by far and away a greater population density than the United States.

&gt;First, I think gun violence is, inherently, a bullshit statistic in exception of mass public shootings. It immediately casts blame on firearms, which seems logical, at first. Guns are weapons designed to kill. However, violence is violence, regardless of the means of perpetration. Fundamentally, it makes no difference if gun violence decreases if general violence isn’t also reduced dramatically. There are no reputable or academic studies of which I’m aware that analyze this relationship, however, so we will be focusing on “gun violence” or “gun homicide”.

Gun violence isn't exclusive to people who intend to commit violence. Accidental discharges, toddlers shooting other kids (yes this happens), and suicide. You can argue maybe some of these incidents might have happened even if it wasn't a gun, but there's also cases where this definitely wouldn't have happened if there wasn't a gun involved (if it was a knife or other object). Also let's not pretend like it isn't easier to kill with a gun than a knife or other object.

&gt;Once we’ve adjusted for suicides and accidents, we still see around 12,000 gun homicides each year. More than half of these deaths are young men, the majority of whom are black. This shows us that gun homicide is most prevalent in low-income, disenfranchised areas and neighborhoods, where crime and gang-related activity is higher. While I’m not necessarily a proponent of, “But it’s gonna happen anyway,” I will argue that (thus far) no proposed gun control legislation will reduce these numbers.

That's not realistic. How many of those kids might not have committed suicide without a gun? How many might have attempted a different way and survived? To pretend like the gun has zero sway on suicide attempts is disingenuous. Also, how do you know that any proposed legislation would do nothing? The majority of legislation on the national level has been blocked by special interests.

&gt;We haven’t even scratched the surface of other issues, such as the sheer number of guns already in circulation, the rampant gun culture in the United States, approaching the issue in the face of the Second Amendment’s existence, or the positives to gun ownership (such as self-defense, defense of property/self against wildlife, etc). I don’t oppose gun control as a concept. It’s an ideology with noble intent that fails to put forth a pragmatic solution to the immensely complex issue that is American gun violence.

People have been brainwashed through partisan hacks that demonize gun control for their monetary interests, and that's why a lot of this stuff doesn't get through. Let's get that out of the way.  Also, nobody has been allowed to experiment with national gun control. It's easy to say ""nothing is going to work"" when nothing has been allowed to work. People need to stop being so uptight. We still don't have UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS. FFS. Even the most basic of legislation gets shot down by idiots screaming about having their guns taken away and politicians trying to grandstand on the issue because they know their voters support them/don't care.",True,False,False,,0,1533170705,,False,0,e3g4lki,False,t3_93r03p,True,t1_e3g2858,/r/MemeEconomy/comments/93r03p/versatile_format/e3g4lki/,,1536982839,3,True,False,MemeEconomy,t5_3gl3k,r/MemeEconomy,public,

http://berserk.wikia.com/wiki/Ys

&gt;Ys (pronounced /ˈiːs/ EESS) is an isolationist principality on the ""northern frontier"", surrounded by ocean. It has a history of shipbuilding and seafaring, and naturally one of the strongest navies in the known world.

this is the homeland of roderick, the man who arranges a marriage to farnese. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ys

To protect Ys from inundation, a dike was built with a gate that was opened for ships during low tide. The one key that opened the gate was held by the king


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradlon

&gt;Later, Dahut had a key role in the story of Ys, a city built below sea level and protected by a gate that kept the sea out. Dahut turned the city into a place of sin and debauchery. One night she stole the key to the gate from her sleeping father and drunkenly opened the gate. Gradlon awoke and rescued his daughter from the drowning city on his magical horse, but her sins kept dragging them into the sea before he could reach land. In the end Saint Winwaloe told him to drop his daughter. She was swallowed by the sea, becoming a form of siren or morgen, luring men to destruction

this last part is a bit ridiculous, and is marked ""needs citation""

&gt;At Gradlon's death, his son Salomon the 1st succeeded him, then his grandson, Aldrien.

&gt;The city of Ys was famed throughout Europe for its beautiful gardens and buildings but over time its reputation fell into disrepute. This came about through the pagan practices of Dahut.  Unlike her father who had been converted to Christianity by Saint Winwaloe, Dahut and many of the city dwellers retained their pagan ways and worshiped the old gods.  Dahut would swim naked in the sea around the walls of the city and preside at ceremonies dedicated to it which were attended by all of its citizens and people came from far and wide to participate.

&gt;It did not take long before  the city came to be seen as a safe haven for pagans to practice their rituals and beliefs and they flocked there.  The city grew rich and prosperous and many fine buildings and gardens were built and it became renowned as the most beautiful city in the world. 


&gt;Dahut was rumoured to take lovers to her bed and in a perverse sort of game made them wear a black satin mask.  Just after midnight springs fitted inside the mask would grip the victim’s throat strangling them.  Later, a dark figure would be seen leaving her chamber carrying a heavy bundle and placing it on a horse, then riding to the cliff tops and throwing it into the sea.  It was believed, rightly or wrongly, that the victim had been sacrificed to the sea who Dahut worshiped.  

&gt;One day, to the great excitement of Dahut, a handsome knight dressed all in red rode through the city gates and up to the palace.  Dahut was intrigued by the handsome stranger and went to great pains to introduce herself to him offering all the hospitality the city could provide.  She soon became besotted with him and he teased her asking what she would do to prove her love for him. The pair ate and drank and made merry and when night came Dahut took him to her bed chamber.  Because she was so besotted by the Red Knight she did not make him wear the mask.  That night a great storm rolled in from the sea and broke over the city.  Great waves battered the sea walls and gates but could not break through due to their strength and width.

she takes the key from her father at the red knight's behest

&gt;As soon as she gives him the key reveals himself as the devil.  In some versions of the story it is the devil who then opens the gates in others it is the drunken Dahut who does the deed.  Either way it is disastrous for the city as great waves flow, into the city drowning everything and everybody in its path.

it appears that there is a game series themed on this legend: (named Ys)

&gt;A feature of the early Ys games is the Darm Tower (or Dahm Tower in some translations). In the story, it is an unfinished and deserted tower, built with the intention of touching the sky. The tower houses a small annex, titled ""the Tower of Rado"" (or simply ""Rado's Annex""[3]) three quarters of the way up.

&gt;According to in-game lore, the normally immortal ancient Ys aged because humans overused the magic power of an ancient artifact, known as the Black Pearl. The result of this misuse was evil magical energy bringing forth millions of cruel demons. The people of Ys fled to the Palace of Solomon and used the Black Pearl to lift the palace into the sky, creating a safe haven. The demons, focused on controlling the Black Pearl for their own intentions, began building the Darm Tower, day and night, attempting to connect to the Palace of Solomon with their construction. As in-game-events transpired, however, the demons' efforts were thwarted.

There is nothing tangible supporting that view; it's been formed by attempts to whitewash the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

A sense of urgency? That would be absurd. Operation Downfall was theoretically 3 months away, and in reality probably more than a year away. 

The Japanese refusal to unconditionally surrender was a moot point by late summer of 1945 anyway(it's been a moot point since Yalta in fact, February 1945, when the USSR and the US secured the terms of the Soviet invasion of the Japanese Empire after Germany's surrender). 

Japan was unwilling to surrender because their Empire was still large by August 1945 so they had the leverage to demand lighter surrender terms. They pretty much lost only SWPA, but still had Korea, huge parts of China, and Indochina(and Japan itself of course). They didn't have a ""fight 'til the end"" mentality, they already knew they lost the war by then and were willing to admit defeat. They realized that they would have to give up the colonial possessions they captured from the European countries, like Indochina, but they were fighting on to maintain control over their core colonies; specifically Manchuria and Korea, where 1,500,000 Japanese settler-colonists were living and where the Japanese government was planning to send millions more. An unconditional surrender would have meant all of Japan's colonies being taken over by the Allies, not just the ones Japan captured during WWII.

They didn't turn their minds around and unconditionally surrender on 15 August because of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. They turned their minds around and unconditionally surrendered on 15 August because on 9 August, the Soviet Union declared war on the Empire of Japan and 89 Soviet divisions invaded Manchuria and wiped the floor with the million-strong Kwantung Army of Japan and other military units in Manchuria.

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Manchuria_1945-A.PNG
By 15 August, it became absolutely clear that the Japanese troops in Manchuria were incapable of putting up any sort of effective resistance. Manchuria was going to be lost within a week, and Korea would be lost in September after the Soviets' logistical trail caught up. Moreover, the bulk of the Japanese Army in the colonies was lost too. The Soviets stripped the Japanese of any leverage they held to negotiate a peace treaty and captured the colonies for which Japan was continuing to fight, making an immediate unconditional surrender the only option.

Hiroshima and Nagasaki did not play a significant part in it.

&gt; BRUSSELS - Brussels journalists covering the European Union have complained that Belgium is breaching media freedom after being told they will have to pay 50 euros to cover the next summit of EU leaders.

&gt; The Belgian journalists association AGJPB said close to 1,000 journalists would be affected and called it a breach of media freedom.

&gt; Journalists accredited to the EU institutions have free access to the headquarters of the Council and Commission in Brussels but special security for summits means journalists and other visitors need additional six-monthly vetting to attend.

As far as I know, there is no passage which abrogates Quran 9:5. 

The context of his time doesn’t change anything, in my opinion. Jesus was ahead of his time. In the same way, Muhammad, a prophet of god no less, should have been far ahead of his time. Not only that, but he evidently knew what he was doing was evil as he condemned it. He condemned owning slaves, but owned slaves himself. He preached tolerance and equality, but treated others as less than his Muslim self.

You can’t preach peace and commit violence. That makes you a hypocrite. Not practicing what you preach is exactly what being a hypocrite means. Muhammad was a hypocrite.

If you look at the second part of my title, you would see that I argue Islam is not only violent, but also violates human rights. 

Yes, not all Muslim countries have the death penalty for homosexuality. That doesn’t change the fact that most Muslim countries violate human rights and criminalize homosexuality. The death penalty argument just shows how extreme Islam authority is in many countries.

I do not know how many sharia courts are operating in America. America hasn’t allowed so many refugees in, so Islam hasn’t been able to spread like it has been in Europe.

I haven’t made this argument difficult on myself...whatever that means. When I argue that Islam is violent, it doesn’t mean it can’t be peaceful. It means that Islam is generally violent and commits human rights violations. If you want to change my mind you have to prove either that 1. Islam is not inherently violent, 2. Muhammad is not evil, 3. Islam authority does not commit human rights violations on a regular basis or 4. At a pace unalike any other religion.

No, I do not think all American muslims are violent. In fact, most Muslims I know personally are very kind people. I never said muslims were violent. I said Islam and Islamic authority is violent.

That only makes sense if you subscribe to two assumptions that one can be ahead on one's time and that the assertions of Islam are real. I don't subscribe to either. A person cannot be ahead of their time because without that person's contributions there's no guarantee that the values they subscribe to will be the values commonly subscribed to in the future.

&gt;You can’t preach peace and commit violence. That makes you a hypocrite. Not practicing what you preach is exactly what being a hypocrite means. Muhammad was a hypocrite.

Muhammad didn't preach complete peace and non-violence at all times. He preached a general idea of peace but that violence was ok in certain situations, e.g. self-defense and jihad.

But you would agree that if there are more than 2 Muslims in the US? And if there are more than 2 Muslims in the US and Islam was an inherently violent religion they would have to form a violent Sharia court to solve their disputes. 

&gt;I haven’t made this argument difficult on myself...whatever that means. When I argue that Islam is violent, it doesn’t mean it can’t be peaceful.

Yes it does. You can argue that Islam is a mostly violent religion or that it is an almost completely violent religion, but those are different arguments than we're having now. You say that it is violent which means that every iteration of it is violent. If I say a ball is blue when part of it is green I am wrong.

We can only name things we see, like meta, Wolf is subbed for Effort while he used to be the shotcaller, the toplaner, Untara not stealing shirts anymore,… 

And you have to admit that the identity of SKT changed completely, they went from complete experimenting (funnels that failed, Bang on ap, …) earlier this split when Faker was playing and thus frantically searching for a way to make it work to a more classic style with Pirean. Maybe they also would have lost a lot of those games with Pirean while having better teamsynergy.

Before Pirean was subbed in, against KT  with Faker, they also went back to that classic style and game 1 they crushed it and even game 2 it worked and they just lost on that baron. Game 3 they completely collapsed though. But if they played like that from the start of spring split they would have had a lot more wins with either midlaner.  
I honestly don't think this is player, or playstyle related but coaching, coachexperience, practice, pick and bans and yes, maybe burn outs from people or personal problems between them. (like Blossom was rated annoying people for being hyperactive and really noisy).

So with what they are doing now they are just trying to make due, regardless of what they will do after the split,  and trying to get play-offs any way they can while taking the storm of not playing Faker etc. Just imagine how demotivating it must be to have to carry the team in the jungle now while it's stated by your coaching staff, casters and the world, that you are the problem.

Europe PMC
Regular usage of cosmetic products and drugs in dermatological vehicles may cause irritant contact dermatitis. For example, aluminum chloride (AlCl3), the most efficacious antiperspirant salt to treat hyperhidrosis, shows high irritancy potential. To mitigate the irritant contact dermatitis caused by topical application of products containing AlCl3, we investigated the anti-irritating effects of aloe extract and taurine in vitro and in vivo. In an in vitro experiment, reconstructed human epidermis model, EpiDerm, was tested with AlCl3 in the presence or absence of taurine and aloe extract. In a human clinical study, 12 adult subjects were tested with two products, a commercial AlCl3 antiperspirant product and a prototype 12% AlCl3 formulation containing 0.1% taurine and 0.1% aloe extract. Skin irritation potential in vitro and in vivo was measured by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-1α, and chemokine, IL-8. Taurine and aloe extract significantly (p &lt; 0.05) reduced IL-lα and IL-8 production in vitro and in vivo after topical application of formulations containing AlCl3. The blend of taurine and aloe extract demonstrated boosted anti-irritation benefits on AlCl3 irritated skin both in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that the combination of these anti-irritating actives may possibly be effective in mitigating irritant contact dermatitis caused by other dermatological vehicles containing irritating agents, but further research is warranted to assess their effects.",True,False,False,,0,1533191402,,False,0,e3gkajs,True,t3_93wvva,True,t3_93wvva,/r/Hyperhidrosis/comments/93wvva/something_to_try_for_skin_irritation_from_topical/e3gkajs/,,1536990156,2,True,False,Hyperhidrosis,t5_2rhwk,r/Hyperhidrosis,public,

Regular beef is available at most chain retailers, but it can vary wildly in quality and is generally not particularly good. There's plenty of restaurants that know how to prepare beef if you're up for that as well, a personal favorite of mine is Crystal Steak House (they've got Angus beef from Bulgaria, Australia, the States, and Argentina if I remember correctly). I don't know if there are any steakhouses around that offer Wagyu/Kobe beef (in fact I believe it might be illegal to import into the EU because of slaughterhouse regulations which Wagyu/Kobe producers do not cover, but I'm not sure).

[You're under estimating launch cadence by about half](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_spaceflight)

We did fall to about one a week in the years after Columbia but have since picked up. In 2014 we hit 92 (the highest since the early 90s), though 2015 &amp; 2016 were down from that bit 2017 had 91.

This year we've had 63 so far - by comparison a number not reached until late September/Oct in recent years. We have somewhere in the neighborhood of 180 planned this year - though some will invetably be pushed to 2019 it represents something of a record and I would be unsurprised to see us hit 140ish 

The increase is being driven by declining lauch costs (thanks spaceX) with several rockets capable of 2-3k/kg compared to 10k/kg just a few years ago. The net result has been a shift from monolithic Geo stationary sats to large constellations in LEO/MEO which require far more launches.
 
We also have private start ups throwing their hat into the ring with rocket lab doing their small cube sat electron rocket at 5 million (actually really expesive on a per kg basis but a obtainable for those not wanting to wait for a ride share) add to that land space (chineese company), laucher one, vector ect.. all small lauchers.

We also have the chineese space agency maturing and reaching a respectable cadence. India with their PSLV and GSLV rockets, Japan's HII and even Europes Ariane all achieving sig reliability and cost reduction.

We should reach 1960s level cadence this year or next (120-150) and baring some large scale disaster should reach about 200/yr by the mid 2020s

If you're into museums, i might have some pointers :D

First of all: BUY A [BRUSSELS CARD](https://visit.brussels/en/sites/brusselscard/)! You can choose for how long (i think it's 24/48/72 hours), you can choose to combine with free public transport and discounts to lots of other stuff. Check the website for all info.

Museums:

\*\*1. Art &amp; History Museum\*\*

Of course everybody knows there is only one museum in Brussels you \*\*must\*\* see: the [Art &amp; History Museum](http://www.artandhistory.museum) (no, i am not biased, you're biased). It's located in Cinquantenaire Park, a really nice park to chill and picknick right next to the European quarter. You can get here by taking metro lines 1 (direction Stokkel) or 5 (Hermann-Debroux), get off at either Schumann or Merode.

It's a bit of a challenge to find the entrance to the Art &amp; History Museum (signalisation is not really good at the moment), but if you go to the esplanade in the centre of the parc, face the arch, go through the arch, stick to the left and walk around the building, you'll end up at the entrance (you'll pass the entrance for schools which will be closed, this doesn't mean the museum is closed. Just keep going, you'll see the entrance round the corner).

If you like history, you can easily spend a whole day in just the permanent collections of our museum. We go from prehistory right up to art nouveau and art deco, and cover almost all continents (only Africa is missing, you'll have to go to Tervuren for that). The architecture of our buildings alone is a reason to visit.

\*\*2. Musical Instrument Museum\*\*

[Right in the centre of Brussels](https://goo.gl/maps/scCWwsqWYBB2), not to far from the Grande Place/Grote Markt, in one of the most beautiful art nouveau buildings Brussels has to offer. It's dedicated to -who would have guessed- musical instruments and the history of music. Extensive collection, a visit of about 2 hours.

At the top there's a restaurant (you can visit without buying a ticket to the museum) with a really excellent view over Brussels.

\*\*3. Halle Gate\*\*

Last surviving gate of the Medieval walls of Brussels, it has a neat little museum inside. Not very well known, but a nice visit anyway (takes about an hour). Can be found [here](https://goo.gl/maps/yATW1YozeA42).

If you have deep pockets and no or medium DIY skills: go to Colora and get advise. They sell BOSS paints exclusively. You can get BOSS in other places, cheaper in some cases (not a lot). But Colora is very knowledgeable about their products. They will set you up with proper brushes, rollers and tape as well. You will pay A LOT, but the paint is totally worth it.

There are some edge cases where I'd prefer other brands (mainly varnishes or lacquer for wood like for instances stairs), but you get very good results with BOSS paints.

My father for instance did our ceilings with only 2 layers : primer and 1 layer of BOSS Top Mat. Which is absolutely bonkers if you look at the end result. If you don't paint for a living, you will need more layers.

Also, some colors just need A LOT of layers. We have a mustard yellow wall in our house and it needed three layers of BOSS's Bolatex paint. Which is one of the cheaper (older) latex paints from BOSS, still very good.

If you're on a budget :
Wait until GAMMA, HUBO, Brico, Brico Plan-it or one of your local shops runs a promotion on one of the brands. I'd advise Levis in a heartbeat, no problem with their paints. Other brands I have less experience with. Dulux is upper scale paint in the UK, but in mainland Europe it is considered a budget brand for instance. So I wouldn't be surprised if they use different formulas based on location.

SPS is a good dutch brand I recently used 20 liters of SPS resimat which is stupid strong but VERY mat paint.

If you need painting advise like : what tape, what brush go to Colora.

Oh and also, buying pre mixed colors that are in stock is always cheaper than letting them be mixed to spec.

I swear by the following products :

Tape : pink TESA tape for general purpose, yellow for lacquer or when it needs to stay for longer than a week. White 3M safe release tape to put on freshly painted parts.

Brushes and rollers :
ANZA all the way. Don't cheap out on a roller! You could paint a whole house with just 1 roller and 1 brush. I'd get a few brushes. Mostly round pointy ones. Bigger, flatter to put a lot of paint on, fine, round pointy if you want to get into corners. Get the universal ones for instance ANZA platinum.

Paint :
Too many to list here but I got great results with :
Levis Keuken &amp; Badkamer
SPS resimat
All BOSS paints
All Sigma paints

Dogma was a watch brand produced in the period 1860-1970 by the Fabr.d'Horl Clémence Freres &amp; Cie. (later - A. Dorsaz &amp; Cie.) in La Chaux de Fonds, Switzerland. This one is a well-known ""watch-city"", where local watch-making culture dates back to the 17th century and is still alive to this very day. It seems that the company started making watches as early as 1860 since in the 60's of the 20th century they celebrated their 100th anniversary (check the vintage ad in the uploaded photos). 

In 1909 the company struck a deal with a watch/gold retailer Siegmund Neumann who had several stores in Basel and Luxemburg. It's very likely that later on, during the World War II this cooperation helped them become one of the Swiss manufacturers making ""Dienstuhren"" or Service watches for the Wehrmacht and the Luftwaffe. Some of their watches from that period are Landeron movements, but they mostly used the Anton Schild (AS) 1130 movement as most of the other comparable German Service Watches providers did - Phenix, Freco, Bulla, Glycine, Helma, Choisi, Nisus, Midi, Era, Flora, Gala, Onda, BWC, Pront, etc. Their pieces during the war were with superb quality. After the war - in 1949, the company was re-registered and the brand was transferred to the Fabrique d'Horlogerie Arthus Dorsaz &amp; Co. They started selling Dogma on their own all over Western Europe. Not much additional info on them during the 50-60s except from October 1956 - the company filled a trademark infringement case agains a rival brand - Dog. Brand made by the Redia watch co. mainly for selling it in Tangier. The case was won by Arthur Dorsaz &amp; Co.

Overall during their whole lifespan the Dogma watches stand for fairly priced, decent quality pieces. Known movements they've used in the 30s, 40s and 50s are FHF 2124, Anton Schild (AS) 1130, Landeron (39, 47, 48, 149), Fleurier (FEF 290) and ETA (853). During the 60's the company was still on the market, but only a handfull of Dogma pieces with Valjoux 7733 have resurfaced, so it's very likely that the company has fallen a victim of the Swiss “Quartz Crisis”.
Last known info on the brand itself is from 1972 when Aubry Frères SA acquired the rights to it. In 2008 the brand reappeared in Madrid, Spain as a low-end designer pieces made by Brit Watch Internacional, S.L. The ""new Dogma"" is using the old logo and claiming to have inherited the old company (this time established in 1897). They are still around and making cheap Rolex and Hublot knockoffs with questionable quality and cheap ETA movements.

""Crise de la masculinité"" : après #Metoo, comment être un homme ?
Le Bailly, David

La déferlante féministe post-Weinstein a définitivement ébranlé le modèle patriarcal. Au fil des débats, c'est l'essence même de la virilité qui a été questionnée. Une crise identitaire provoquant une prise de conscience, et qui pourrait à terme rétablir l'équilibre entre les genres.

S'il fallait retenir un seul signe du malaise des hommes en Occident, c'est bien leur silence lors de la déferlante #Metoo. Alors que des milliers de femmes dénonçaient les abus de pouvoir et les agressions sexuelles dont elles disaient avoir été victimes, eux sont restés muets, tétanisés. On aurait pourtant aimé les entendre, nos philosophes, nos romanciers, nos cinéastes !

""L'Obs"" a d'emblée soutenu le mouvement #Metoo. Mais, lors des conférences de rédaction, les hommes préféraient passer leur tour quand le sujet venait sur la table. Dans toute la presse, les articles consacrés au mouvement étaient presque exclusivement écrits par des femmes. A coups de tribunes, des intellectuelles s'interpellaient sur la notion de consentement ou sur une possible ""liberté d'importuner""...

Au Festival international de Journalisme qui vient de se tenir à Couthures, un débat intitulé ""Faut-il se libérer de la virilité ?"" réunissait quatre femmes et un seul homme, le sociologue Raphaël Liogier, qui partage les arguments néoféministes. Dans ""Descente au coeur du mâle"" (Les Liens qui libèrent), écrit au moment de la vague #Metoo, ce dernier explore les racines de la domination masculine et expose son propre inconfort :

""A mesure que je me plongeais dans les témoignages de femmes harcelées, voire violées, j'éprouvais une sensation de dégoût. Le dégoût s'est progressivement transformé en malaise. Ces hommes sont dégueulasses, certes. Souvent pitoyables. Beaucoup sont des salauds sans vergogne. Mais surtout ce sont des hommes comme moi. [...] Même si je n'ai pas voulu l'avouer immédiatement, une partie de mon identité virile m'était renvoyée en plein visage.""

De façon générale, les hommes se retrouvaient auscultés comme des cas pathologiques, des personnes à rééduquer. Il aura fallu attendre plusieurs mois avant d'entendre des voix masculines à contre-courant du discours ambiant. Le réalisateur allemand Michael Haneke (deux fois palme d'or à Cannes) pouvait s'indigner contre ""un nouveau puritanisme empreint d'une haine des hommes : bien sûr, toute forme de viol ou de contrainte sexuelle doit être sanctionnée. Mais je trouve l'hystérie et les condamnations sans procès auxquelles on assiste aujourd'hui tout à fait dégoûtantes"".

Récemment, ce fut au tour de Jean-Pierre Le Goff de dénoncer sur France-Culture "" un climat de suspicion généralisée. [...] Le risque, c'est que les rapports hommes-femmes soient uniquement considérés sous l'angle de la domination et de l'aliénation avec un schéma comportementaliste : une innocente victime face à un pur salaud. Je pense que les choses sont plus compliquées que ça"". Et le philosophe de pointer du doigt ""la crise de la masculinité"" :

""Le patriarcat, je veux bien qu'il reste, mais il a quand même été bien entamé. On fait comme si on était toujours au XIXe siècle ! On ne peut pas raisonner comme si on était encore dans la situation de familles ordonnées autour d'un père. Quand vous voyez toutes les familles monoparentales ou recomposées... ""

""Crise de la masculinité"" : le sujet est dans l'air depuis longtemps. Le silence des hommes sur #Metoo est le signe d'un désarroi, mais plus encore d'une impuissance. C'est le paradoxe de ce mouvement : dénoncer une société patriarcale au moment même où celle-ci est pour le moins déstabilisée. Dans la sphère familiale, à l'intérieur du couple, et plus généralement dans l'ensemble de la société. La revue ""le Débat"", qui vient de consacrer un numéro spécial au ""Masculin en révolution"", ne s'y est pas trompée. Son rédacteur en chef, Marcel Gauchet, y proclame non sans provocation ""la fin de la domination masculine"". A le lire, elle serait ""morte dans son principe"". Parmi les explications de ce phénomène anthropologique selon lui majeur, il y a bien sûr l'explosion de la famille traditionnelle, organisée autour de la figure mythologique d'un père à l'autorité incontestable. Et les prochaines tentatives du gouvernement d'étendre la procréation médicalement assistée (PMA) aux femmes homosexuelles ou célibataires devraient encore raviver le débat autour de la place des hommes.

Autorité parentale conjointe

Tuer le père : le phénomène est loin d'être nouveau. Sur le plan juridique, cela fait près d'un demi-siècle que, dans le Code civil, la notion de ""puissance paternelle"" a été abolie au profit de celle d'"" autorité parentale conjointe "". Pour Marcel Gauchet, cet écroulement de la figure paternelle ""a été accueilli sans déplaisir par le plus grand nombre des intéressés. Jamais dominants ne se seront accommodés avec autant d'aisance de l'abandon de leurs prérogatives. La vérité est qu'il a été le soulagement d'un fardeau pour eux aussi"". Peut-être. Mais sans ces ""prérogatives"", longtemps présentées comme ""naturelles"", que reste-t-il aux hommes ? Quelles valeurs portent-ils ? Et surtout à quoi servent-ils ? Dans ""le Figaro"", l'écrivaine américaine Nancy Huston faisait remarquer :

""Au long des dizaines de milliers d'années de l'évolution de notre espèce, les femmes ont choisi les hommes forts pour protéger leur progéniture, et cette sélection sexuelle a eu pour effet d'augmenter la force et l'agressivité des hommes. On demande l'impossible aux hommes. On leur demande d'être forts et faibles, durs et attentionnés, puissants et sans pitié dans le monde du travail, et doux comme des agneaux à la maison. Comment être un homme face à toutes ces demandes contradictoires : c'est ce que j'appelle la virilité vrillée.""

Si la campagne #Metoo a mis en lumière la question du pouvoir et des abus sexuels, elle n'est pas allée jusqu'à remettre en question une représentation féminine de la virilité et de ses attributs (statut social, fortune, force physique) ni la répartition des rôles dans le jeu amoureux, comme l'illustre le débat autour du consentement féminin (qui, selon certains, revient à graver dans le marbre ce principe sexiste : ""l'homme propose, la femme dispose"".)

Ce qui fait dire au philosophe Gilles Lipovetsky, toujours dans la revue ""le Débat"", que #Metoo n'a rien d'une nouvelle révolution sexuelle. ""Il est très significatif qu'elle ne se soit pas accompagnée de la revendication égalitaire, de la part des femmes, à devenir aussi entreprenantes, aussi actives que les hommes en matière d'avance sexuelle. [...] Elle permettra sans doute de changer quelques comportements masculins, mais elle n'appelle pas les femmes à changer leurs propres manières de se conduire en matière de vie sexuelle et de séduction érotique.""

Examen de conscience

Dans la sphère intime aussi, la thèse de Pierre Bourdieu sur la domination masculine a du plomb dans l'aile. Lors de la dernière grande enquête sur la sexualité en France menée par le sexologue Philippe Brenot (2011), 44% des femmes en couple se disaient sexuellement très satisfaites, contre 33% des hommes. 70% d'entre elles jugeaient désormais les préliminaires suffisamment longs - tandis que 60% des hommes disaient craindre par-dessus tout de décevoir leur partenaire. Philippe Brenot résume :

""La majorité des hommes d'aujourd'hui sont très attentifs à des valeurs de séduction qui conviennent mieux aux femmes. Ils se livrent davantage par la parole, ils tentent d'écouter - même si c'est parfois difficile - et cherchent le dialogue. [...] Les hommes sont devenus plus ouverts, mais aussi plus fragiles. C'est d'ailleurs ce que beaucoup de femmes leur reprochent.

Now US cars have been big and heavy for a very long time, cars in the tailfin era were already in the 1,500-2,500kg range.

A first generation VW Golf from the 1970s weighed 800-900 kg, the modern version weighs 500kg more, is 20 cm wider and 70 cm longer.

&gt; 
&gt; Referring to ""some strange, weird incidents involving Tampere people"" at the games played in Coimbra, Manuel Machado said that in Turkey in April 2014, when it was learned that Coimbra had defeated Tampere, he noted that ""the environment was an excessive aggression "".
&gt; 
&gt; The leader of the local government even said that the defeated ""have been upset"" because Coimbra won, which will have been verified in loco by the mayor, the councilwoman of Culture and the Rector of the University of Coimbra.
&gt; 
&gt; We recall that the organization of the European University Games confirmed that ""After the complaint of the Finnish athlete, the case was immediately reported by the security of the organization to the police who arrived there 15 minutes later, having identified and questioned the alleged victim and aggressor.""
&gt; 
&gt; According to the European University Games ""The case is already in the DIAP and the Games Organization is collaborating with the Public Prosecutor's Office in order to obtain all the documentation about the case, such as the security report of the event and the procedures taken by the organization "".
&gt; 
&gt; The fourth edition of the European University Games took place between 15 and 28 July, in Coimbra, with the participation of some 3150 athletes, representing 295 universities from 40 countries, which were housed ""out there"".
&gt; 
&gt; EUG 2018 was organized by the Coimbra University, the Coimbra Academic Association, the Coimbra City Council and the Academic Sports University Federation.
&gt; 
&gt; Coimbra applied for the second time to receive this large European competition, having been defeated by the candidacy of Zagreb and Rijeka in Croatia for the 2014 EUSA Games organization.
&gt; 
&gt; In 2014, in Denizli, Turkey, Coimbra was luckier and managed to defeat the Finns of Tampere.
&gt; 
&gt; We would like to remind you that the announcement of the winner of the bid for the Games, which also took place in the Finnish city of Tampere, was made on 5 April 2014 during the gala of the annual meeting of the European association, attended by representatives of the Academic Association of Coimbra (AAC), the Coimbra Municipal Council (CMC) and the University of Coimbra (UC), leading institutions of the Portuguese candidature, as well as the then Secretary of State for Sport.

Yes. Rule of thumb is that you fall under the social security law of the country where you work. There are some exceptions, though, like postings or Beamte. As I said, for details it's best to check out the relevant EC Regulation No 883/2004. The general rule is in Article 11, and the special cases are in the following articles.

However, you still get your health and unemployment insurance benefits from an institution in your country of residence. The insurance carrier in your country of residence then charges the insurance carrier in the country where you work. So I pay my health insurance premiums to a Swiss insurer, but I also have a German health insurance card for use in Germany with a somewhat special status and I get the same benefits as any member of the German statutory health insurance in Germany. That card is only visually different from the usual German health insurance cards in that there is no EHIC on the back side - rather, the EHIC is printed on my Swiss insurance card and I have to use that one in any EU country other than Germany.

Thats just means a person knows what he is doing is criminal or what someone else is doing is criminal. Mens rea is intent. A person must be consenting and aware he is commiting a crime. Its irrelevant to this. 

&gt;&gt;Mens rea (/ˈmɛnz ˈriːə/; Law Latin for ""guilty mind""[1][2][3]) is the mental element of a person's intention to commit a crime; or knowledge that one's action or lack of action would cause a crime to be committed. It is a necessary element of many crimes.

Yes, certainly there’s a limit. If the UK was going to literally collapse and become a third world country then it obviously wouldn’t be worth it.

I don’t know exactly where I’d draw my own personal line - I can’t give you a precise number. The difficulty is that we’re all trying to predict the future with no real idea of what is going to happen. It is hard enough to predict 2 or 3 years into the future based on the current situation; it’s practically impossible when there are so many known unknowns. 

&gt; also on the point of soverignity, what would you say is a greater threat to our ability to govern our own laws, the European union, or pressure by large MNCs that exert pressure on our government to change laws to suit their own agenda?

I want our government to be able to pass a law which then governs our country. There are always lobbyists trying to influence those laws. I’d argue that the EU actually makes this far, far worse - as big MNCs can lobby Brussels and get one law passed which then affects all 28 member states. That’s much more “efficient” than lobbying 28 separate governments.

So they are now openly admitting it's not a matter of national security, but just a way to get leverage. Which means the tariffs break WTO rules. They probably broke the rules even if it really was about national security, but now that possible defense is gone.

I can't think of a much stupider idea. When other countries face tariffs they don't just throw their hands up and agree to whatever the US demands. They impose counter-tariffs, and will just say, 'well remove your tariffs and we'll remove ours'.  We know this, because China has already done it. Canada and the EU are also set to impose tariffs (and maybe already have?). And since the US is putting tariffs on every other country, the US doesn't have the option to turn to other countries to import goods and skirt the tariffs. China, Canada, Mexico, the EU, etc have dozens of countries they can turn to in order to skirt the US tariffs however.

Also, the entire mindset is just cruel. Trump is saying that it doesn't matter that other people in other countries are being hurt; all that matters is Americans. I know the racist members of his base might love that idea, but most people have empathy, and actually care if other people get hurt. I agree with the idea of trying to make more money.

Find a very stable relative, trusted friend or mail-forwarding service to use as your registered address. The address on your driver's license, registration and title shall match. Your credit/debit cards should also be at this address. To save a bit of trouble, if at all possible, register in a state that does not require annual inspections. Many RVer-centric mail-forwarding services are in Florida for this reason.  


The folks at your registered address can forward your annual registration which you update online to you via mail. This is a once-per-year headache.  


You will want to find an efficient, comfortable car, despite those factors tending to counteract one another, with service centers found in both rural and urban locations. If you have spent much time at travel centers over the last five years you will note the preponderance of Nissan Versas with distant plates. This should not be considered a recommendation. You should operate the car normally for at least half of its warranty period (in miles) so that you become familiar with its quirks before setting off.  


This car should be kept free of non-standard appearing parts, with the possible exception of a roof rack. No stickers, additional logos or fanciful graphics of any kind. Anything you intend to keep with you that isn't safety related shall be stowed obscured, ideally in the trunk. Get a distinct device to use as a sat-nav, and be certain you have a power bank to power your sat-nav, vehicle camera(s), phone, and any other daily use devices you may require which charge via USB and let the car keep the power bank charged. If you intend to have a laptop with you, an in-cabin desk might be warranted. Do not move the vehicle with the desk in use position or the laptop powered.

Have a fire extinguisher readily reached by the driver and invest in one of those larger first-aid kits. These are things better to have and not need than the other way around.

Carry spares of light bulbs/modules and the like. Do not set off without ""pre-flight"" on any journey more than 100 miles. You will want video cameras that can connect ""to the cloud"" for evidence. Document your journey on a daily basis in any form you fancy, but be certain to do so. In the however unlikely event you ""disappear"" a record of some kind may be required to commence a private or publicly sponsored investigation. Get a bottomless data-plan, even at 3G speed.

Have an explicit destination in mind. If an authority figure intervenes, they expect a quick, explicit answer to your ultimate destination and your purpose for heading there. (""I am on my way to Miami to visit my sister"") Not having this information can cost you weeks of your life and thousands of dollars. On the same token, never carry anything that might be considered contraband. This includes alcoholic beverages, firearms of any kind for any purpose, or persons who may appear to be under 27 years old who do not have identification documents with your last name on them. In rural areas of the south, midwest, southwest, mid-south, and eastern bits of the Pacific Northwest a car with people who appear to be of different races is an invitation to trouble. In the event this may come to be, stick religiously to the Interstates and be prepared to explain to authority the nature of your longstanding relationship with these people and why you are travelling together. In my experience, marriage is not a suitable excuse.

Work out which of the super-regional or national travel centers you like best and get their loyalty card. Pilot-Flying J has free wi-fi for loyalty card holders and those vacuum coffee machines that keep it fresh tasting. Establish a protocol for waste. Dispose of the waste in the car at least once per day or at every fuel stop. If you are over 40, fill the fuel tank when you get to half full. You'll be stopping about that time anyway. This is also a defense against contaminated fuel. Minimize or eliminate consumption of caffeine while traveling over the road.

And, in online discussions, it’s, unfortunately, far too common for someone to go “oh, well you believe this, so you’re an idiot”, to dismiss someone’s otherwise well articulated argument. 

People who think conservatives are idiots, or liberals are idiots, or libertarians are idiots, etc. Our *entire* 2-party, political system is basically run run this way. Why do you think there are “party line” voters? Because they reduce the intelligence of the opposing side based off of one argument they perceive is (or could actually be) wrong, then conclude the other side couldn’t possibly be right about anything else.

This is just one among *many* reasons this happens though. 

However, you’ll rarely see this opinion expressed as cleanly as shown in OP, though it still happens with surprising regularity. 

Instead, you’ll usually hear someone insult another person’s intelligence because of something else, then proceed to claim that person can’t have made a good point about something else. 

Example, and person me for picking on one side of this issue, i’m sure that you can find plenty of examples for the opposing side. 

A conservative makes a point about devising gun safety legislation that is actually effective, instead of blanket banning certain products based on metrics that people who don’t really understand guns have made up. 

A liberal comes in and says “oh, you’re a conservative, so you just want guns sold to everyone willy nilly!”

The implication is that “being a conservative” is “ben Carson the politician” (being an idiot) and therefore can’t have made a point about guns, an area where the person happens to be “Ben Carson the Neurosurgeon”.

A counter example (just in case) is when a liberal makes a point about how we can achieve universal health care, then cites basically all of europe and Canada, but a conservative chimes in “you’re just some communist/socialist liberal”.

Again, being a liberal = Ben Carson the politician = you couldn’t possibly have made a rational point. 

TL;DR: you will rarely ever see a cut and dry example like the above, where someone literally claims “well you were an idiot about this, therefore you have to be an idiot about everything else”. Usually, you’ll see people instead insult each other’s beliefs, implying they’re idiotic, then dismissing the argument, because an idiot can’t make any good points. Basically, wherever you see people resorting to ad hominem attacks, they’re employing this tactic.

Um pequeno texto sobre essa época fantástica que era o Estado Novo:

Denegação por anáfora merencória


&gt;""Eu nunca fui obrigado a fazer a saudação fascista aos «meus superiores». Eu nunca andei fardado com um uniforme verde e amarelo de S de Salazar à cintura. Eu nunca marchei, em ordem unida, aos sábados, com outros miúdos, no meio de cânticos e brados militares. Eu nunca vi os colegas mais velhos serem levados para a «mílícia», para fazerem manejo de arma com a Mauser. Eu nunca fui arregimentado, dias e dias, para gigantescos festivais de ginástica no Estádio do Jamor. Eu nunca assisti ao histerismo generalizado em torno do «Senhor Presidente do Conselho», nem ao servilismo sabujo para com o «venerando Chefe do Estado». Eu nunca fui sujeito ao culto do «Chefe», «chefe de turma», «chefe de quina», «chefe dos contínuos», «chefe da esquadra», «chefe do Estado». Eu nunca fui obrigado a ouvir discursos sobre «Deus, Pátria e Família». Eu nunca ouvi gritar: «quem manda? Salazar, Salazar, Salazar». Eu nunca tive manuais escolares que ironizassem com «os pretos» e com «as raças inferiores». Eu nunca me apercebi do «dia da Raça». Eu nunca ouvi louvar a acção dos «Viriatos» na Guerra de Espanha. Eu nunca fui obrigado a ler textos escolares que convidassem à resignação, à pobreza e ao conformismo; Eu nunca fui pressionado para me converter ao catolicismo e me «baptizar». Eu nunca fui em grupos levar géneros a pobres, politicamente seleccionados, porque era mesmo assim. Eu nunca assisti á miséria fétida dos hospitais dos indigentes. Eu nunca vi os meus pais inquietados e em susto. Eu nunca tive que esconder livros e papéis em casa de vizinhos ou amigos. Eu nunca assisti à apreensão dos livros do meu pai. Eu nunca soube de uma cadeia escura chamada o Aljube em que os presos eram sepultados vivos em «curros». Eu nunca convivi com alguém que tivesse penado no Tarrafal. Eu nunca soube de gente pobre espancada, vilipendiada e perseguida e nunca vi gente simples do campo a ser humilhada e insultada. Eu nunca vi o meu pai preso e nunca fui impedido de o visitar durante dias a fio enquanto ele estava «no sono». Eu nunca fui interpelado e ameaçado por guardas quando olhava, de fora, para as grades da cadeia. Eu nunca fui capturado no castelo de S. Jorge por um legionário, por estar a falar inglês sem ser «intréprete oficial». Eu nunca fui conduzido à força a uma cave, no mesmo castelo, em que havia fardas verdes e cães pastores alemães. Eu nunca vi homens e mulheres a sofrer na cadeia da vila por não quererem trabalhar de sol a sol. Eu nunca soube de alentejanos presos, às ranchadas, por se encontrarem a cantar na rua. Eu nunca assisti a umas eleições falsificadas, nunca vi uma manifestação espontânea ser reprimida por cavalaria à sabrada; eu nunca senti os tiros a chicotearem pelas paredes de Lisboa, em Alfama, durante o Primeiro de Maio. Eu nunca assisti a um comício interrompido, um colóquio desconvocado, uma sessão de cinema proibida. Eu nunca presenciei a invasão dum cineclube de jovens com roubo de ficheiros, gente ameaçada, cartazes arrancados. Eu nunca soube do assalto à Sociedade Portuguesa de Escritores, da prisão dos seus dirigentes. Eu nunca soube da lei do silêncio e da damnatio memoriae que impendia sobre os mais prestigiados intelectuais do meu país. Eu nunca fui confrontado quotidianamente com propaganda do estado corporativo e nunca tive de sofrer as campanhas de mentalização de locutores, escribas e comentadores da Rádio e da Televisão. Eu nunca me dei conta de que houvesse censura à imprensa e livros proibidos. Eu nunca ouvi dizer que tinha havido gente assassinada nas ruas, nos caminhos e nas cadeias. Eu nunca baixei a voz num café, para falar com o companheiro do lado. Eu nunca tive de me preocupar com aquele homem encostado ali à esquina. Eu nunca sofri nenhuma carga policial por reclamar «autonomia» universitária. Eu nunca vi amigos e colegas de cabeça aberta pelas coronhas policiais. Eu nunca fui levado pela polícia, num autocarro, para o Governo Civil de Lisboa por indicação de um reitor celerado. Eu nunca vi o meu pai ser julgado por um tribunal de três juízes carrascos por fazer parte do «organismo das cooperativas», do PCP, com alguns comerciantes da Baixa, contabilistas, vendedores e outros tenebrosos subversivos. Eu nunca fui sistematicamente seguido por brigadas que utilizavam um certo Volkswagen verde. Eu nunca tive o meu telefone vigiado. Eu nunca fui impedido de ler o que me apetecia, falar quando me ocorria, ver os filmes e as peças de teatro que queria. Eu nunca fui proibido de viajar para o estrangeiro. Eu nunca fui expressamente bloqueado em concursos de acesso à função pública. Eu nunca vi a minha vida devassada, nem a minha correspondência apreendida. Eu nunca fui precedido pela informação de que não «oferecia garantias de colaborar na realização dos fins superiores do Estado». Eu nunca fui objecto de comunicações «a bem da nação». Eu nunca fui preso. Eu nunca tive o serviço militar ilegalmente interrompido por uma polícia civil. Eu nunca fui julgado e condenado a dois anos de cadeia por actividades que seriam perfeitamente quotidianas e normais noutro país qualquer; Eu nunca estive onze dias e onze noites, alternados, impedidos de dormir, e a ser quotidianamente insultado e ameaçado. Eu nunca tive alucinações, nunca tombei de cansaço. Eu nunca conheci as prisões de Caxias e de Peniche. Eu nunca me dei conta, aí, de alguém que tivesse sido perseguido, espancado e privado do sono. Eu nunca estive destinado à Companhia Disciplinar de Penamacor. Eu nunca tive de fugir clandestinamente do país. Eu nunca vivi num regime de partido único. Eu nunca tive a infelicidade de conhecer o fascismo.""

On one hand the polymorph spell states:

&gt; The target’s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast.

Which should imply class features, as they are part of the target's game statistics.

This is confirmed by [this Tweet.](https://www.sageadvice.eu/2017/11/09/if-a-raging-barbarian-is-polymorphed-through-the-spell-polymorph-is-the-rage-still-ongoing-2/)

However, JCraw also ruled that [an Abjuration wizard keeps their Arcane Ward if polymorphed.](https://www.sageadvice.eu/2016/10/23/if-an-abjuration-wizard-with-arcane-ward-polymorphs-into-a-beast-does-he-retain-the-arcane-ward/) Which is also a class feature.

As the first tweet I quoted is from 2017, and the second is from 2016, I am inclined to rule that they can't smite.

Edit: The most recent [Rules Answered](http://media.wizards.com/2017/dnd/downloads/SA-Compendium.pdf) that I can find states:

&gt; Can you concentrate on a spell while transformed by polymorph? You can’t cast spells while you’re transformed by polymorph, but nothing in the spell prevents you from concentrating on a spell that you previously cast before being transformed.

~~As Smite is a form of spell casting (in that it uses a spell slot) I still would rule you can't Smite when polymorphed.~~

Edit:  I have spread a falsehood on the internet, I humbly apologize.

In the last chapter of his autobiography The World of Yesterday: Memories of a European (1942), Stefan Zweig lamented a lost world of freedom:

“Before 1914, the earth had belonged to all. People went where they wished and stayed as long as they pleased. There were no permits, no visas, and it always gives me pleasure to astonish the young by telling them that before 1914 I travelled to India and to America without passport and without ever having seen one. One embarked and alighted without questioning or being questioned… The frontiers which, with their customs officers, police and militia, have become wire barriers thanks to the pathological suspicion of everybody against everybody else, were nothing but symbolic lines which one crossed with as little thought as one crosses the Meridian of Greenwich… I, a case-hardened creature of an age of freedom and a citizen of the world-republic of my dreams, count every impression of a rubber stamp in my passport a stigma…”

Zweig’s lamentation evokes a sympathetic echo in many liberals today, when borders are springing back into view across the world. For Zweig, freedom meant the Hapsburg empire, where people could live securely without needing any particular national identity. This was the world in which he grew up, and without it he was homeless. When he became convinced that the liberal Europe represented by the Hapsburg empire had “committed suicide”, as he put it in letters to friends, it was too much to bear. On 22 February 1942, the day after he posted the manuscript of his memoirs to his New York publisher from Brazil, where his flight from Nazi Europe had ended, Zweig and his wife, Lotte, killed themselves.

Three quarters of a century later, Douglas Murray also thinks Europe is destroying itself. In the first sentence of his best-selling The Strange Death of Europe, published in 2017 and now reissued in an updated paperback edition, he declares: “Europe is committing suicide.” But whereas for Zweig it was nationalism that destroyed Europe, for Murray it is Europe’s loss of belief in itself. Murray – associate editor of the Spectator and founder of the right-leaning Centre for Social Cohesion think tank – criticises liberals for denying or diminishing the problems that come with sudden large increases in immigration, when the migrants come from other cultures. But the real problem, he is convinced, is an influx of Muslims.

Discussing the public response to the migrant crisis, he writes: “What very few people saw or mentioned was that the racial background of the incomers was an insignificant matter alongside the far greater issue of creed.” The most important fact about the crisis, Murray asserts repeatedly, is that it involves the encounter of Islam with a hollowed-out, guilt-ridden, faithless Europe. The consequence will be the Islamisation of the continent and the end of European civilisation. Citing the work of the French novelist Michel Houellebecq approvingly, he comments that when the protagonist of his novel Submission (2015) finally converts to Islam “he will be part of a community of meaning for the first time… the logic of Islam is practical, and, in a society ripe for submission, irrefutable”.

Murray’s evident admiration for Houellebecq is telling. Much of The Strange Death of Europe reads more like a sensational novel than an exercise in analysis. The book has the form of a narrative, comprising a succession of arresting vignettes – migrants burning down a camp in Lesbos, sexual assaults by immigrants on women and children in Germany, racism among migrant groups in Lampedusa, terrorist atrocities in France – and concluding with a dramatic denouement. The story is necessarily selective, and misses out a number of salient facts.

One of them is that the migrant crisis is global in its reach. It is not only Europe that shuts out Muslims. So do many Muslim countries. Saudi Arabia has built a 600-mile-long fence along its border with Iraq, and there are similar barriers between Turkey and Syria, and Iran and Pakistan. Beyond the Muslim world, Mexico deports larger numbers of migrants back to Central and Latin America than the Trump administration does. Elsewhere war and environmental collapse are powerful factors in population flows. Worldwide, large flows of people are a by-product of globalisation. Rapid movements of capital and production continuously destroy livelihoods, and uneven economic development gives workers an incentive to seek opportunities in richer countries where they may not be welcome. These are not clashes of civilisations, and where Islam is involved the conflicts are often intra-Islamic.

In Murray’s defence it might be argued that his narrative has to do with immigration in Europe, not throughout the world. Even so, it passes over key facts. The Schengen treaty is barely mentioned but it is this agreement that has made the migrant crisis intractable by removing internal borders from much of the continent. Empty chatter about a Europe-wide solution only highlights Europe’s incapacity to act.

Migrant numbers have fallen over the past year. But for the Visegrád Group – Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia –the optimum number is zero, while Austria and Italy are bent on deporting migrants that have already arrived. In Germany, the interior minister’s threat to close the country’s borders produced a compromise in which tighter controls will be instituted. Merkel’s coalition has survived for the time being, but it cannot be too long before the far-right AfD (Alternative for Germany) – whose mounting electoral threat triggered the political upheaval – enters government. Macron in France is holding out against the trend, but he is alone. In a paradox that Murray does not explore, the result of pursuing the stupendous liberal project of Europe-wide freedom of movement is the illiberal Europe we have today.

Writing in this magazine two years ago (“The age of hyper-terrorism”), I suggested that European institutions faced a trilemma they could not resolve: “Open borders, liberal democracy and highly developed welfare states are not simultaneously sustainable… A continent-wide process of Orbánisation is under way.” Pre-1914 Europe was able to be borderless because democracy was limited and the welfare state only beginning. Once they are enfranchised, popular majorities resist open borders because they fear the effects on welfare provision and wage levels and demand some say in the overall direction of society. When their protests are ignored by mainstream politicians, they turn to authoritarian leaders. The success of Viktor Orbán in Hungary, where he secured a “super-majority” in parliamentary elections in April, is only an incident in the march across Europe of what the Hungarian leader has described as illiberal democracy. The trilemma that has defeated European institutions is being resolved by events. Borders are being reinstated in a disorderly scramble. Liberal Europe is fading from memory.

As part of this process the European social democratic model is becoming extinct. Writing in the New York Review of Books in 2009, the historian Tony Judt – an impassioned social democrat – noted:

It is not by chance that social democracy and welfare states have worked best in small, homogeneous countries, where issues of trust and mutual suspicion do not arise so acutely. A willingness to pay for other people’s services and benefits rests on the understanding that they in turn will do likewise for you and your children: because they are like you and see the world as you do. Conversely, where immigration and visible minorities have altered the demography of a country, we typically find suspicion of others and a loss of enthusiasm for the institutions of the welfare state.

The force of Judt’s analysis will only be strengthened if, as could possibly happen, Sweden proves to be the next domino to fall to the far right.

There is nothing accidental in the demise of social democracy. It was always at odds with continent-wide labour mobility – a neoliberal project that presupposes the rollback of national welfare states and downward flexibility in wages. What is unexpected – at least for unthinking liberals – is that the far right has benefited most from social democracy’s demise. With the centre left shrunken and moribund, voters have flocked to fringe parties, many of which have links with interwar fascism.

Murray thinks there is little to fear from the rise of the far right. Indeed, except in a few fringe cases, he denies that anything of the sort is occurring. He admits that “truly fascist” parties have re-emerged – Golden Dawn in Greece and Jobbik in Hungary, for example – but takes a benign view of parties such as France’s Front National and Germany’s AfD. These “thoughtful and clearly non-fascist parties once described as ‘far right’” are simply instances of democracy in action. It is difficult to share his complacency. Marine Le Pen’s mask of moderation slipped when, in the closing stages of last year’s presidential election, she deployed her father’s hate-filled rhetoric in an attempt to rally her core supporters. The AfD may have begun as an association of Eurosceptic economists, but it has evolved into a party a sizeable number of whose members seem sympathetic to “revisionist” views of Germany’s 20th-century history, including the Nazi period.",True,False,False,,0,1533217642,,False,0,e3h14xr,True,t3_93ze95,False,t3_93ze95,/r/centerleftpolitics/comments/93ze95/how_deep_is_the_decline_of_the_west/e3h14xr/,,1536998012,4,True,False,centerleftpolitics,t5_3oilk,r/centerleftpolitics,public,
