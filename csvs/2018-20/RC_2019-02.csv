The headline-making births last November of the world’s first gene-edited babies (twin girls) was unsurprising in one way: The scientist involved was from China. As part of its effort to dominate scientific spheres including biotechnology, China has taken the lead in testing uses of Crispr, a tool newly available to researchers enabling them to alter DNA codes simply and inexpensively. Chinese scientists were the first to test Crispr in monkey embryos, in non-viable human embryos, in adult humans, and now in creating designer babies. Now China is confronting accusations that its regulatory system is overlooking the ethical considerations and medical risks.
1 Did China approve genetic altering of the babies?

The scientist who altered the genes of the twin girls as embryos, He Jiankui, says he had approval from the medical ethics committee at Harmonicare Women and Children’s Hospital in Shenzhen. An investigation by the Chinese government found that He deliberately evaded government regulations and forged ethical review documents, the Xinhua government news agency reported on Jan. 21. The result of that investigation prompted He’s employer, Southern University of Science and Technology, to fire him.


2 What explains the uproar over this case?

Altering the genes of an embryo changes DNA in every cell, including the eggs or sperm, of the resulting person, alterations that will be passed on to progeny. The technique works by making cuts in DNA, some of which may be unintended and bring unknown effects. Normally, participants in clinical research must give their informed consent, something embryos obviously cannot do. The scientist, He, says his goal was to produce babies immune to HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, by altering a gene in the embryos that makes a protein called the CCR5 receptor, which HIV uses to enter cells. To some researchers, that’s insufficient grounds to justify such high risks, since HIV infection is relatively uncommon in China, there are other ways to prevent it and it’s treatable. Even if the gene-editing worked, the twins won’t be invulnerable to HIV, which can also invade cells via a receptor called CXCR4. What’s more, studies suggest that CCR5 deficiencies increase vulnerability to West Nile virus and influenza.
3 What rules does China have in place?

Under guidelines issued by the National Health and Family Planning Commission in 2003, gene editing of embryos isn’t banned, but the use of genetically modified eggs, sperm or embryos for reproduction is prohibited. These guidelines are not laws, and they are enforced through the commission’s ability to withdraw the licenses of fertility clinics.
4 What are the rules elsewhere?

Twenty-nine of the 47 member states of the Council of Europe human-rights organization, including France, Denmark, Switzerland and Spain, have ratified the 1997 Oveido Convention, which prohibits genetic modification of reproductive ""germline"" cells. The U.S. Congress has banned the Food and Drug Administration from considering germline-editing trials. A 2002 Australian law calls for imprisonment for 15 years for anyone who purposely makes heritable alterations in a human cell. Reports by the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine in 2017 and the U.K.’s Nuffield Council on Bioethics in 2018 concluded that human trials of editing germline cells should be used only to fill unmet medical needs and benefit those whose genes are altered.
5 What explains China’s approach?

China wants to be a leader in the defining technologies of the 21st century and has poured billions into funding research. As a participant chosen for its prestigious Thousand Talents scheme -- a plan to lure back talented Chinese from overseas -- He would have received at least a starting bonus of about $143,000 for his research, with the possibility of additional research grants of roughly $700,000. He also founded a startup called Direct Genomics that makes DNA-sequencing equipment, which also received government funding, according to its website. According to the database clinicaltrials.gov, China has 12 human trials involving the Crispr method. One of these is active, with eight in the recruiting stage. In the U.S., there are eight Crispr-related trials, six of which are recruiting and none of which are active.
6 How is China responding?

The country’s biotech companies and universities have worked hard to counter suspicions that their endeavors are rife with fraud and minimally supervised experimentation. The Genetics Society of China, the Chinese Society for Cell Biology and other groups were quick to condemn He’s gene-editing work, calling it a serious ethical violation. A Chinese branch of the World Health Organization pulled an application to register the gene-editing project in a clinical database.

* The technical advantages that are required to establish new UHP GE capacity, is worth digging into. This [reference on graphite properties](https://acs.omnibooksonline.com/data/papers/2007_D031(K).pdf) is worth a read, if you want to understand the physics and chemistry that make UHP electrodes better. The nightmarish scenario during operation of a graphite electrode is disintegration or breakup of the electrode in the furnace. Since graphite electrodes have to handle high temperatures, while simultaneously handling high voltage, steel mills with high capacity furnaces prefer graphite of higher diameter (24-inch diameter or UHP electrodes - large diameter electrodes handle high voltages better), with low CTE (coefficient of thermal expansion) resulting in high thermal stress resistance (TSR, to handle high temperatures or temperature shocks due to cooling and reheating of the furnace). China makes a significant number of electrodes with coke sourced from coal tar pitch (not even petroleum coke), instead of needle coke. High TSR GEs require needle coke over other the two forms. Producing high quality needle coke in large quantities also requires technical know-how, especially since [such technology is licensed from some player, like Chevron Lummus Global](https://www.mcdermott.com/CLG/Bottom-of-the-Barrel-Upgrading/Coking), hence the emphasis on pricing done by Phillips 66 (who would license such the proprietary technology or have something similar). So, quite a significant fraction of Chinese electrodes tend to have lower TSR, and hence the reason why they aren't export-quality. The newer UHP capacities that are being developed are therefore the more credible threat to the GE market. Adverse reactions to new Chinese capacity are not warranted, as long as established players can retain a technical edge and sustain realizations for their products.
* The stock market (at least in India) didn't efficiently price in graphite electrode stocking done by steel mills, when they were faced with a supply shock. Most Western steel producers (US/EU) have long-term contracts to manage GE requirements, and have 6-9 months of inventory. Steel producers like Outokumpu (the second largest stainless steel manufacturer in the Americas) and AK Steel, imposed an electrode surcharge on their monthly price contracts, to pass on higher input costs. Manufacturers like them, believed the short-term electrode prices were not representative of actual costs, and thus, the imposed surcharge reflected what the steel prices in an environment with a electrode supply-shock. You can visit their [Americas pricing page](https://www.outokumpu.com/en/surcharges/stainless-steel-alloy-surcharges-americas), and download the monthly price list to see the surcharges in effect from [April](https://secure.outokumpu.com/das/aaf/openReport3PDF.aspx?format=pdf&amp;type=AAS&amp;prodType=0&amp;mode=default&amp;lang=EN&amp;cult=en-US&amp;uom=ton&amp;xz=0.64d9e0afe52c3&amp;aafPeriod=201804) to [Dec](https://secure.outokumpu.com/das/aaf/openReport3PDF.aspx?format=pdf&amp;type=AAS&amp;prodType=0&amp;mode=default&amp;lang=EN&amp;cult=en-US&amp;uom=ton&amp;xz=0.b5fc413cdc3fa&amp;aafPeriod=201812) 2018.

Lack of a surcharge doesn't necessarily mean that GE electrode prices have crashed to 2017 levels, considering the surge in needle coke prices which accounts for 40% of an electrode cost; it's possible but less unlikely. The \~80$/t surcharge imposed by Outokumpu, implies that GE prices were abnormal in a certain period, and may have dropped to a more reasonable level. This new level may not as high as $80/t, but also not as low as pre-supply shock price of around $9/t, so the GE prices are effectively being absorbed by the steel mill or efficiently passed on to the steel buyer [at some price in between 9 and 80](https://www.steelonthenet.com/cost-eaf.html) ($21-24 based on electrode pricing at $10k/tonne).

The Smash community is bigger and have more influence over esport media than the entire FGC. It has more people in it, more community-based tournaments, etc. They have 3 EVO-sized tourneys during the year, and all those 3 never put any FGC scene in main stage. While the biggest FGC tourneys of the year all put Sm4sh and Melee on main stage in some forms. And in Europe alone, there's 3 times more Smash regionals and majors than FGC's regionals and majors.

The grassroots of both scenes are fundamentally different, coming from totally different places. Smash grew in livingrooms and small gatherings in highschools and colleges, while the FGC grew in the Arcades. To this day, there's very little overlap between the two communities.

People saying that Smash is not a fighting game are either trolls or in total denial. This is a legit fighting game series, just like For Honor. And both of those series are fighting games that are not supported by the FGC. I'm sick and tired of people accusing us of ""Gatekeeping"", intolerance and other bullshit, just because we want to protect and support what made the FGC what it is. Some Smash players (not all, but still) are asking respect from us, when they don't give us the respect we deserve.

PLAYER NAME: Maximilian Faber

TEAM: Krefeld Pinguine/Löwen Frankfurt

REASON HE SHOULD RECEIVE A HIGHER OVR CARD: Maximilian Faber is hands down my second favorite card in EA SPORTS NHL 19 Ultimate Team, however there are a few problems with his base card that do not reflect him as a player in real life.

He currently leads the DEL2 in scoring as a defenseman with 15 goals for Löwen Frankfurt, yet his card in HUT is a lowly 55 OVR with 37 WSA and 43 WSP. On top of that, he's the only Bronze Common skater in the game with players like David Vaysberg having a 59 OVR base despite having only 1 point in his Major Junior career with the Shawinigan Cataractes of the QMJHL.

This is not a joke when I say that Faber's card is criminally underrated in EA SPORTS NHL 19 Hockey Ultimate Team. He has the skills in real life to play with some of the best in Europe yet as mentioned prior players with almost no experience in pro hockey are rated higher than him.

Attached is a screenshot of my experience with Faber's 55 OVR across 21 games of Division 1. He has 4 goals and 13 assists, which is incredible for a player who on paper shouldn't be able to exist.

DontMentionWombats,1454377190.0,,knowswiki,[],,,dark,text,t2_uc6ci,False,"That's where you are wrong - free markets cannot continue to exist without regulation, and without government/taxation to pay for the infrastructure required for markets to function.  It is not possible.  Already Adam Smith understood this, viz. his example of roads.

""Free market"" does not mean free-for-all anarchy, corporate oligarchy, or statist control, whether right or left.  For a market to be free it must follow consistently applied and reasonable rules and laws, and allow equal access to the market for all.  I noticed that you mentioned Plan Condor - I assume you're from Chile or Argentina.  The fact that shitheads like Pinochet and Videla invited the Chicago Boys does nothing to change the positive aspects of a system of free trade - for anyone who claims otherwise, I just have to mention Stalin or Hitler.

You can be in favor of free trade and exchange while accepting that things like shitty Chinese labor practices, African raw materials exploitation, and European pollution are a filthy disgrace.  Getting rid of these is absolutely compatible with free markets and trade.  This is why rules exist, and these rules are why we no longer have things like institutionalized child labor in Europe, leaded gasoline, and many other awful things.  

Regarding your Coltan example, it's not relevant.  Free trade has been the major catalyst behind the drastic and increasing fall in extreme poverty around the world, mostly in developing nations in recent years, over the past century and a half.  There has always been injustice, and there will always be injustice, regardless of what sort of economic or political system you have; the point of the kind of regulation that allows free markets to continue existing is that it will gradually try to fix these flaws because people like you and I put pressure on both our governments and the companies to buy from to fix it.

What model phone do you have, by the way?  Where are your clothes made?

Free markets and capitalism are not a panacea.  They are not a ""system"".  They just are.  People want to trade, it is natural.  Like any activity in any society, it needs rules so people and companies do not abuse each other.  Anyone who claims otherwise is not worth listening to - and I say the same to anyone who claims to have a better idea without objective proof that it works.

&gt; Al Stewart (born in Glasgow, Scotland on 5 September 1945) is a British songwriter and musician. He is best known for his 1976 single Year of the Cat and its 1978 follow-up Time Passages (both produced by Alan Parsons). Stewart's inspiration for his songs primarily comes from the past; indeed, he is credited with creating his own genre, ""historical folk rock"". At one time in his life, Stewart took guitar lessons from King Crimson guitarist Robert Fripp.

&gt; Stewart grew up in the coastal resort town of Bournemouth, Dorset. According to  Songfacts, in days of youthful folly Stewart played in a beat group with later BBC DJ Tony Blackburn before moving to the capital to seek fortune and fame.

&gt; Having bought his first guitar from future Police guitarist Andy Summers, Stewart traded in his electric guitar for an acoustic guitar when he was offered a weekly slot at Bunjies Coffee House in London's Soho in 1965. From there, he went on to compete at the Les Cousins folk club on Greek Street, where he played alongside Cat Stevens, Bert Jansch, Van Morrison, Roy Harper and Ralph McTell

&gt; Although he had his share of the breaks, including a tenure at Bunjees coffee house and a record deal with CBS, life wasn't always easy for the young troubadour; his first serious love affair ended in disaster, and he experienced all the usual insecurities of the stranger in the big city trying to find his way.

&gt; In January 1970, Melody Maker named his second release Love Chronicles its Folk Album Of The Year, but in spite of his obviously carving out quite a name for himself, it was not until Year Of The Cat  - the single and even more so the monster album - that he really shot to fame.

&gt; He emigrated to the United States as his career took off in the mid 1970s, and still lives in California. While studio albums are now few and far between, he still tours extensively in the United States, and, most years, in Europe. Recordings of concerts are often made available through his fan clubs.

Or the psyche of straight men.  It created all types of insecurities that caused you to feel the need to overcompensate for the sake of others and as a result become toxic.

In the 1950s something happened in American and European culture which resulted in the socially normal male identity becoming rather toxic.  What triggered this major paradigm shift is not agreed upon but was possibly tied to WW2 causing widespread PTSD in most of America and Europe's male populations.  These men who suffered from the truly horrible emotional scars of WW2 then went on to become role models for their sons.  A man being emotionally withdrawn, callous, brooding, avoiding physical human contact, and regularly exhibiting aggressive outbursts lines up rather well with this timeline.

&gt;&gt; On Thursday, intelligence police and National Guard officials threatened to board a tanker docked at PDVSA’s Cardon port, on Venezuela’s western coast, to pressure the vessel’s crew to discharge diesel that had not been paid for by PDVSA and was sold by U.S. refiner Citgo Petroleum, according to four sources.
&gt;
&gt;Refineries in the United States have started to reduce crude processing, and Valero said Thursday that it had stopped buying Venezuelan crude.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; The tanker carrying diesel arrived in Venezuelan waters on Jan. 25 before sanctions were issued, and finished unloading a first parcel of diesel at Puerto la Cruz refinery’s dock earlier this week, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; European refiners and oil firms including PDVSA’s partner Nynas AB and Spain’s Repsol have put on hold cargoes that were scheduled to be shipped from Venezuela until the U.S. Treasury clarifies if oil swaps will be allowed and European countries announce any sanctions to come, according to sources and Refinitiv Eikon data.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; U.S. sanctions do not prohibit Europe from receiving Venezuelan oil or trading houses, including Europe-based ones like Trafigura or Vitol, from acting as intermediaries for Venezuelan cargoes to be ultimately sold to refineries around the world.

The advice I'm about to give you is not standard in the EU/NA community so it'll seem weird to many people here, but it's worth thinking about. This is not cookie-cutter newbie advice.

Adrenaline Hammer Guy is a pretty common archetype in the Chinese BB community. You give him a weapon with the stagger effect (e.g. 2-handed mallet), which will knock enemies to the end of the turn queue. It will also lower their initiative in the next turn, as well. Your bro's high initiative means he will tend to go before enemies and stagger them, ensuring that the staggered target can be hit by all of your guys before he gets to respond.

This pairs well with other 2-handers, double-grippers, and DPS bros in general, as the damage-dealers can swarm the staggered target and kill them without being in much danger.

I personally would give him Colossus (or Student if you're confident you can keep him alive), Dodge, Adrenaline, Recover, and Backstabber (because he has crap melee skill). He will need to rely on surround bonuses to hit reliably, which is unfortunate but unavoidable on this particular bro. He is a flanker and will usually move in to attack guys who are already engaged.

Keep in mind that initiative drops as fatigue builds in a counterintuitive way (https://www.reddit.com/r/BattleBrothers/comments/afqgij/have_i_been_misunderstanding_how_fatigue_effects/), so you will need to be careful with his fatigue. He will need melee skill, melee defense, fatigue, and a sprinkling of initiative when he low-rolls in other stuff. Gifted would be good here. Eventually going Colossus-&gt;Nimble will also do wonders for his survivability while keeping his fatigue low and his initiative high (with mid-range lightish armour).

This guy will be useful in this role from the early game through to the end game, but he will survive much better in early levels with Colossus and Dodge.

Nations of Europe and Asia have already developed extensive high speed rail lines in their country. States like Germany, France, and China have created systems that efficiently move people across their countries. These high speed rail lines have cut down on traffic congestion, and have been good for the environment. Even the United States has some high speed rail lines within its borders. 

Unfortunately, Canada has not gotten around to this. As of this moment, we are the only G7 country without high speed rail. This is not because Canada is unsuitable for high speed rail. The Quebec-Windsor Corridor and Edmonton-Calgary Corridor are well positioned for this technology to be implemented. 

As Prime Minister, I am proud to say that I began the process of finally bringing High Speed Rail to this Country. I am even more proud to stand here today and present a concrete plan that will deliver Canada's first true High Speed Rail Line. 

The benefits of this plan are obvious. Travel by train is more environmentally friendly than having everyone drive in a car. Given the ever present threat climate change poses, it is important that we consider this fact when making our transport policy. 

The rail line would also generate money for the country. Such a project would spur investment in the region, bringing in new sources of tax revenue. The plan would also likely result in more ridership on trains in the area, leading to increased revenue from fares. 

Further, the plan will reduce the stress places on the 401, the 417, and Autoroute 20. This will reduce traffic on these roads, and reduce the stress they are under. I'm sure we all know that the 417, just a few blocks away from this House, is under a lot of stress, and any reduction to the number of cars on it would be a great benefit. 

I urge all in this House to vote for this bill. This is an important infrastructure investment, and a major step for Canada into the 21st century. We are already behind other countries in this respect, a delay will just push us back further. Let us not let that happen.

He is not making that claim in the slightest.

He’s saying that the facts underlying those incorrect viewpoints are not controversial, in that they are not contested. He is also saying the *conclusions* drawn from those facts by the alt-right are absurd and incorrect because the people coming to those conclusions lack the tools to understand the data and interpret it correctly.

He gives the example “African Americans commit more violent crimes than European Americans.” That statement is statistically correct. It is not a controversial statement in and of itself. He even invites you to view the data on the Department of Justice website to verify that it is true. Please do so if you doubt the accuracy of that statistic.

He then explains how the alt-right, lacking the tools to understand the reasons *why* that is the case, make the erroneous claim that it must be so becasue African Americans are *genetically predisposed to violence*, which is a conclusion one cannot draw from the premise without support, of which there is none.

So it goes with gender essentialism. The statement “Men and women have different priorities” is true. Acknowledging that statement as true does not mean you, by necessity, must believe that to be true because men and women are intrinsically different. 

The fact that you don’t understand Pinker’s position here suggests you don’t have much experience with his work outside of youtube clips and critiques of his work that support your presuppositions.

Moreover, as the human body does not differentiate fructose absorption, whether it comes from HFCS, cane or beet sugar, or from an intrinsic source such as that present in fruits or fruit juices( 19 , 46 , 47), would this reduction also be necessary for fruits that contain relatively large amounts of fructose such as apples, apricots and ripe bananas? Should honey also be removed from our diet( 48 )? These questions have confused the typical consumer of sweet (and sweetened) food products( 49 ). This confusion may have been intensified by the issuing of a scientific opinion on fructose by EFSA in 2011. With this, European food manufacturers can claim that ‘consumption of fructose leads to a lower blood glucose rise than consumption of sucrose or glucose’( 50 ). Having evaluated the scientific literature at their disposal(47 , 51 – 57 ), the EFSA panel assumed that, when fructose replaces sucrose or glucose in foods or beverages, the claimed effect will be obtained. The panel took into account two human intervention studies(51 , 52 ) that showed a consistent significant reduction in postprandial glycaemic responses. This occurred without disproportionally increasing postprandial insulinaemic responses. Further, the panel noted that the mechanism by which fructose (when replacing sucrose or glucose) in food or beverages could exert the claimed effect was well established.
The panel did note that high intakes of fructose (set at ≥ 25 % of total energy) was shown to lead to metabolic complications such as dyslipidaemia, insulin resistance and increased visceral adiposity, based on several review articles( 47 , 53 – 56 ). With this scientific opinion, and related health claim, the panel clearly took a different position from the opinion that fructose is toxic and should be treated as alcohol

EtadanikM,1470441942.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_105wcs,False,"Look, people are going to complain that it's not fair, not merit based, etc. But this was obvious from the start: to be all merit based, you can't have developers and organizers deciding anything at all. ALL positions have to be based on merit. Since you can't have regions playing each other constantly in qualify, the way it has to be done then is:

* Season should start with 3 teams for every region = 18 total for the first major tournament. This is the season kick off. The reason not to use the international is because teams usually change players right after.
* Teams finish where they will. Now, you determine 15 region slots by average team placement: top region = 4, 2nd region = 3, 3rd region = 3, 4th region = 2, 5th region = 2, 6th region = 1.
* Each major tournament after, repeat the process based on the previous major tournament's results.
* Using *average* placement ensures regions aren't penalized for having fewer teams in a tournament. In fact, they are rewarded for doing so since there is a higher chance of that team doing better and raising the regional average. But this advantage quickly goes away in the event that their next best team can't cut it.
* Break ties with highest finishing team, then lowest finishing team, then previous major tournament placement, until there is no tie

Using this system, after the last major tournament, we'd have the following:

* Europe - 4 slots with average finish of **7.0**
* Southeast Asia - 3 slots with average finish of **7.0**
* China - 3 slots with average finish of **7.25**
* Russia - 2 slots with average finish of **7.5**
* North America - 2 slots with average finish of **8.3**
* South America - 1 slot with average finish of **9.0**

Which it sounds like, is what everybody wants, right?

**EdF**: had his time getting us to the semi finals last season and while I'm grateful for the magical evening that saw us knock Barcelona out, I don't think he's ready yet. He's like, just slightly better than Enrique for us at this point and that's not what we need. That said, whenever we talk about firing a manager, we have to talk about his replacement. Is there anyone out there who would be an improvement whom Pallotta will pay for? I can't think of anyone if one exists.

**Monchi**: I'm done with this guy. I can't deny his results at Sevilla, but maybe he was just lucky with investments there. His transfer record with us has been poor at best, and he's not even better than Sabatini. Way overrated and I wish him luck.

At one point there were three teams after him (Real Madrid, Liverpool, Chelsea), and Chelsea ended up paying even more for Kepa than Liverpool did for Alisson. I don't remember the last time a team overhauled a roster, bringing in 10 new players after reaching the semifinals of the Champions League.

I get it, we need money, and our players were getting old. That said, selling players can only get you so much money each year, while building on what we had as a squad for sustainable success is more of a long-term solution. Of course I'm not saying we'll reach the semifinals every year, but even the knockout stages would've been nice. Now we risk not even making the Champions League at all. 

Okay fine, let's say he had to sell, but how about reinvesting that money wisely? Who are some of his better investments? Kolarov, Zaniolo, Under... that's it? Maybe Olsen (despite that horror show vs Fiorentina)? What about guys like Bianda, Coric, Marcano, Rui, Karsdorp? Schick has been an absolute disappointment, and the veterans like Cristante and NZonzi haven't been spectacular by any means. Remember Jonathan Silva and Hector Moreno? Gregoire Defrel and Maxime Gonalons? Those guys barely lasted over a year and were garbage during their stay here. Make no mistake: he has downgraded our roster at every single position by a significant margin.

And guess what, because of these downgrades and failure to go far in Europe, we'll be going back to selling players again for half their worth now that we're an established ~~supermarket~~ bargain bin.

Because of this I have relatives in Washington and California, which creates a cultural connection to those states. I have several Chinese Canadian friends who have a similar family history of migration along the coast, so it's a common pattern. 

If you look further back, in the early days our province was populated by British supporters from Oregon territory who fled when the Americans took over Oregon. These people brought some of their (mixed) culture with them, as did the next wave from California. At this time, Chinook language was commonly spoken in communities in BC, Wash &amp; Oregon, contributing to a shared culture. Even if we don't speak it today, the diversity it allowed in trade and social interactions must have contributed to our culture, as does the Salish cultures that cross today's border.

As a rule, if someone asks ""what PHP framework should I use for a project"" and they're asking for a project that I'm not personally involved in architecting, the fact that they're asking generally means they're the market segment Laravel works nicely for. This includes solo developers (again, not my personal choice, but using it for a solo project means if you ever have to hand it off to someone else they'll kind of know what's going on). Plus Laravel has a strong ecosystem all the way to the shallow end of the pond, so to speak.

By contrast, Symfony (Laravel uses a number of Symfony components, but in a quite different way) has made huge strides in getting the framework to a point where it's easier to set up, but they'll admit that they're playing catch-up to Laravel.

Cnut the Great (; Old English: Cnut se Micela; Old Norse: Knútr inn ríki; c. 995 – 12 November 1035), also known as Canute, whose father was Sweyn Forkbeard (which gave him the patronym Sweynsson, Old Norse: Sveinsson), was King of Denmark, England and Norway; together often referred to as the North Sea Empire.

Yet after the deaths of his heirs within a decade of his own, and the Norman conquest of England in 1066, this legacy was lost. He is popularly invoked in the context of the legend of King Canute and the tide, which usually misrepresents him as a deluded monarch believing he has supernatural powers, contrary to the original legend which portrays a wise king who rebuked his courtiers for their fawning behaviour.

As a Danish prince, Cnut won the throne of England in 1016 in the wake of centuries of Viking activity in northwestern Europe.

As for protected. Take a German doctor licensed to practice medicine in Germany. Personally I’d be  perfectly fine with giving him my money to be my doctor, because I trust the German government medical licensing procedures. Same thing with most OECD licensed doctors. But what does it take for those doctors to come here and practice medicine, it is a monumental undertaking and they have to complete another six years of residency. Nursing is not easy either it’s very difficult for foreign trained  nurses to come to United States. Just those two facts right there severely limit medical labor thus raising costs. The reason US doctors are paid so much more isn’t because they’re better....it’s becusse there’s fewer of them.

Funnily enough in the 1920s that’s exactly what happened European doctors were flocking in mass to the United States because of a recession in Europe. American doctors were getting upset they were facing downward pressure and wages the lobby Congress in the mid to late 1920s the AMA gained a monopoly power over licensure.

 The same is true of hospitals. If you’re in the city and you want to open a hospital you need permission from all the other hospitals in your region first. Think about opening a restaurant but before you can do that need permission from all your other competing restaurants. This is the federal certificate of need. 

 Let’s not even go into pharmaceuticals in that shit show. there’s also massive barriers on medical equipment, robotics and basic tools.  I work in ERP consulting. That’s enterprise resource planning, I help large firms implement incredibly complex software suites that manage everything from finance to CRM to internal IT etc. etc. 

Hospitals for all there mounds of money they are insanely slow in implementing new ERP systems. Slower than any other industry I’ve ever seen. Part of this is regulatory compliance but a much larger part is a mix of government regulations causing a distortion in price signals and a complete and total lack of competition.  Large firms constantly implement new systems and get rid of old systems to upgrade and become more efficient to save costs and generate revenue. When firms do this and they’re in competition with other firms it creates a downward pressure on prices despite regular inflation. Alternatively you keep prices stable and wages in those industries rise, see big tech as a perfect example.  but in the medical industry this does not happen. Some of the ERP tools they use look like shit straight out of the 80s it’s so bad it’s revolting and somewhat insulting. I’ve seen some of these hospital groups and what’s their financial statements, the kind of money they could throw around on cutting-edge systems that would drastically enhance patient management, patient outcomes And drastically reduce overhead costs.

Pre-Order/ Devolpment funding. There an old joke in the table top gaming industry. How do you make a small fortune in the gaming? Start with a larger fortune. Profit margin for games, are incridibly tiny. After publishing, shipping, warehouse, retial cut most games have are floating int he low double digit to single digit profits. Games only start making money, when they are ever green, and when they get to mass retail.

Release Date: Pretty much impossible to gauge. Very few board games folks, are doing this full time, and even if they were, the amount of time actually making games is a fraction of the time. Adminstration time, community management time are much more time expensive and almost always more time critical. Then there are third party, who the dev doesnt have much control over when they deliver. 

Shipping confirmations, tracking, notifications. This is also, pretty fucking hard. A lot of games are manufactured over seas, and sent over in as large bundle as possible in bulk freight shipping. Like my copy of Red Market was printed, I think in Hong Kong. Shipped in a boat, from there to California, from California shipped over to Las Vegas and then shipped back to me in Mojave california. The only point in that chain where my inddivual tracking infomration comes into it, is when it hits the regional distributor to me. But that when its done like 85 to 90 percent of its travel. Its all slow bulk freight. 

And this just assuming things just go fine. Red Market as an example again, all their european customers almost didnt get their books because of EU toy shipping regulation and choking hazzards. After weeks of delay, talking to other industry vetrans, talking to EU trade regulators over skype at shit ass in the middle night hours. It looked like they were going to have to pay for custom packaging and pay for it to be ceritfied by the EU to be shipped in Europe. Entirely unexpected, and incridibly expensive process.

One player I would love to have is:

Jarno Kärki

Liiga, Porin Ässät

Ässät has been horrible this year but Kärki was having a great career year before he was sold to switzerland so ässät could save some money.

One thing for the content team, and mostly for anyone who is in charge of the player overalls of european players:

Many of the player overalls are super random, good example here:

We have these two Kärpät players: Jasper Lindsten and Sami Anttila

Lindsten had 2 30ish point seasons in a row and is on track for another one this season.

Anttila is career high 7point player

Their overalls, as you would guess are 60 and 69, Lindsten being the lower overall here.

Another example; Antti Suomela, last year he won scoring in Liiga with 60points in 55gp. And Suomela is now NHL-player for the Sharks, yet his overall is only 67, that makes him the 14 highest base card overall player on the collection of JYPs players(his team last season)

Random silver players from european leagues are of course not that popular to use on your ultimate team.  But just little more recognition for the euros could mean something for someone.

I do remember Tomi Kallio getting a Milestone card in nhl 14 or 15, maybe for becoming like the highest scoring foreign player in SHL(not 100% sure what was the milestone, and at the time everyone else was confused also). So in Finnish Liiga Canadian Eric Perrin became last year the highest scoring foreign player and this season he achieved the status of having most games played by foreigner.

&gt; The Police were a new wave band which formed in 1977 in London, England. The band consisted of Sting (vocals, bass), Andy Summers (guitar) and Stewart Copeland (drums).  The band released five albums -- ""Outlandos d'Amour"" (1978), ""Reggatta de Blanc"" (1979), ""Zenyatta Mondatta"" (1980), ""Ghost in the Machine"" (1982) and ""Synchronicity"" (1983) -- before entering a hiatus in 1984 and ultimately disbanding in 1986

&gt; The band reunited in January 2007 for a reunion tour that lasted until August 2008. 

&gt; Biography 

&gt; The Police formed in early 1977 in London by Stewart Copeland (drums), Gordon Sumner, better known as Sting (bass and lead vocals), and Henry Padovani (guitar). Andy Summers later joined the group, and after a very short stint as a quartet, Padovani left the band. The Police became one of the most popular bands in the late 70s and throughout the 80s.

&gt; The Police are notable as one of the first mainstream white pop groups to adopt reggae as a predominant musical form and to score major international hits with reggae-styled material. (The first all-white reggae band with permanent members and frequent recording in Europe was Peps Blodsband, lead by Peps Persson from south Sweden who changed from blues to reggae 1974/75). Although reggae was already very popular in the United Kingdom (due to the large number of Caribbean immigrants) and a number of Western European countries, reggae was little known in the United States and rejected by most black artists in U.S, and prior to the emergence of the Police only a handful of reggae songs had enjoyed any significant chart success. The Police, UB40, The Clash and Bob Marley (Jamaican, partly living in England after being shot in Jamaica, are considered with a number of new wave, rock and ska bands as one of the leaders of the Second British Invasion of the U.S.

&gt; The Police were strongly influenced by reggae (especially reggae drumming and base lines), jazz and, in the beginning, punk rock – something that came to be shifted more and more towards pop during the 80s. Their lyrics also changed from challenging, but yet somewhat politically restrained punk- and new wave lyrics, to after 1982 in some songs emphasize environmental awareness and human oneness. The biggest hits, however, had romantic or sexual themes. The Police met together with other ""white"" British bands which played reggae, as UB40,  criticism from black English rastafarian reggae bands like Aswad (in a BBC documentary on TV) and Steel Pulse, for being accomplices in the music industry of ""Babylon"", stealing the Caribbean slave descendants' musical treasure. This criticism has later been withdrawn. Aswad has even made the covers of Police songs like ""Roxanne"".

&gt; Tension grew between the band members, because unlike most other bands, they did not share songwriting credits. They released their last album, Synchronicity, in 1983, selling over 8 million copies. Synchronicity is critically regarded as their best album, with hits such as Synchronicity II, King of Pain, and probably their best known song, Every Breath You Take. In 1984, after touring in support of Synchronicity, The Police went on hiatus while Sting pursued his acting and solo music careers. Two years later, The Police reformed and played a few concerts for Amnesty International.  Soon after the band went into the studio. Sting wanted to re-record their old songs but Andy and Stewart wanted to leave the originals alone and only two songs were re-recorded during these studio sessions. Although the group is considered to have disbanded in 1984, 1986 was the last time The Police engaged in any musical activity. 

&gt; In 1992 the band released ""Message in a Box"", their 4 CD box set, and performed at Sting's wedding to Trudie Styler.  A live CD was released in June 1995. On March 10, 2003 The Police were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  and performed Message in a Bottle, Roxanne and Every Breath You Take.

&gt; The Police reformed in 2007 and opened the Grammy award ceremony of that year with a performance of Roxanne. Towards the end of May the band began a world tour.  In  2008  the tour ended at Madison Square Garden, New York on August 7, and The Police disbanded for good.  Sting was quoted towards the end of the tour that he had achieved closure with the band and revealed that The Police would never tour or record again. 

&gt; Sting has said that the material on the album Ghost in the Machine were inspired by the writings of Arthur Koestler, and that the Police's final studio album Synchronicity was influenced by the writings of Carl Jung. Sting also peppers his songs with literary allusions: the song ""Don't Stand So Close to Me"" mentions Vladimir Nabokov's  novel Lolita; ""Tea in the Sahara"" alludes to the novel The Sheltering Sky by Paul Bowles; and ""Wrapped Around Your Finger"" refers both to the sea monsters Scylla and Charybdis, from Greek mythology, and to Mephistopheles, from the German legend of Faust .

Shadie777,1395157491.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_fqzib,False,"I wouldn’t say extreme, but I would say hard remainers are those who can’t accept a compromise brexit. You can usually see some comments saying that they wouldn’t go for customs union with single market integration (which is only a starting point in negotiations of course) because it’s worse than EU membership.

This is true, but constantly shitting on the only compromise brexit measure we have with the EU on this matter will lead to a bad outcome. Only campaigning for remain will cause societal destabilisation through ignoring the 52%. Never realising they are doing the same thing hard brexiteers doing by ignoring remainers and going for the hardest possible brexit.  

The argument should have always been that a soft brexit is what was mandated with the opportunity to join in the future if we want.

Now I understand that Russia’s interference has made an impact. I’m of the opinion that they exploited what was already there. There was always a divide in Britain over the EU, and I’m worried that just cancelling brexit without listening to the 52% will destabilise us.  Just like how not listening to the 48% has fucked us over the last 2 years.  

I said this before, and I will say it again, this lack of compromise has fucked us over. Just like the hard brexiteers lack of compromise fucked over brexit negotiations from the very start. This total divide has totally played into Russia’s hands.

The best way out of this situation is a soft brexit, and for me the added caveat of another referendum on the proposed deal at the end of this.

&gt; The Institute of Directors warned that 29% of firms in a survey of 1,200 members believed Brexit posed a significant risk to their operations in the UK and had either moved part of their businesses abroad already or were planning to do so.

&gt; Large companies such as Sony and Panasonic have relocated their European headquarters from the UK to the continent, but the IoD said smaller companies were also enacting plans.

&gt; The survey of company directors found that 11% had already executed relocation plans and 5% were planning to relocate in connection with Brexit, while a further 13% were &amp;quot;Actively considering&amp;quot; a move out of the UK. Exporters were more likely to consider a move, with two-thirds looking to shift overseas.

And I love arguing with atheists because they have no knowledge whatsoever about history especially after a sentence like this "" This sounds like something written by someone who has gotten most of  their knowledge of history from The History Channel post 2004 or so. "" 

Buddy it seems that you got that from history 101. 

"" Sure it is, buddy. I'm not the one arguing that a benefit that results to  a very-few for a very-short time qualifies as ""good"", but knock  yourself out in your incomprehension. ""

You are making a claim with no backup whatsoever and you say I'm knocking myself out ? Unemployment was dropped from over 30% to under 10. Even after the war when Germany was completely destroyed which would other countries take years and years to get to a certain level o social standard Germany is now the biggest power house in the EU and of the biggest in the world. Don't be irritated I'm not German and I oppose every aspect of their politics during the nazi regime  

Regarding Dostoevsky, where have I given you the implication that I find it hard disagreing with you regarding that matter ? In your first response you haven't said anything about it. Cool buddy you agree with them, I never heard of them except Immanuel Kant whom I also very much respect and I heard about Hume but never read anything about him or let's say much. What I saw the others are comedians, authors and doctors of medicine. But whatever fits your agenda.  Dostoevsky was praised by Kafka, Einstein and even Nietzsche (I don't need to say anything else). But you are right of course not universally correct, everyone needs to make his own decisions

""No, my moral values are a lot more broad-based than that, as I've shown. ""

No they are not. Ok well maybe not yours but the values of western civilazation are based on it. And it really doesn't matter if you point out that there have been prior to Judaism similiar moral values. The fact is that todays western civilazation is based on the Judeo-Chrisitan values. Even atheists acknowledge that. Of course not all especially Anti-Theists because they oppose everything what has to do with christianity and they'd rather link their moral values with values of mesopotemia than Judeo-Christian ones but with no link to them. Again you can't deny the past just because it doesn't fits your agenda.  (coming back saying love arguing with people with history 101 knowledge...note you started with this mocking so don't get mad at me) 

"" Because it reduces the value of the testing and puts you into a position  wherein you achieve grades that you cannot back-up in a practical  environment. ""

This isn't an argument because there is no point in the value of testing if it doesn't bring someone forward who has no moral values because it makes no sense to have it for someone who believes that there is no god

"" Because it breaks the possibility of trust and lowers your sense of accomplishment in your abilities."" 

A man with no morals or the need to be moral doesn't need trust and accomplishment is not directly linked with theft. Some of the biggest thieves have accomplishement more than the ones they are stealing from. 

"" As I said much earlier, I don't require a ""highground"" from which to  preach, because I don't subscribe to the ""from authority"" framework that  religious people need for their sense of self. ""

No you don't require one from which to preach but why should anybody listen to you ? Just because you said ? What is the point or the base of it ? Why is right right and wrong wrong ? In christianity line between right and wrong is a straight one that links directly to God. But you could jump around those line as you please and make it up for yourself which fits and benefits you the most. If you want to do it like that you can of course. You have free will and can do anything what you want. I'm not talking about YOU, I'm talking about the western civilization and his foundation. 

"" I can answer the main question there, but the more-important element is  your admission right there: Why do you require someone to *know* about how good you were or were not? Why do you care whether or not someone will remember your acts? ""

Is this really a question ? You are talking to someone who believes in the christian God. Think about that for a moment.

""Society"" doesn't decide anything; it's an abstract concept used to talk about the *result* of a shit-ton of individuals living their lives in close-contact with one another.""

Well...yes it actually does. They decide if you action are right or wrong and this concept they have again (talking about western civilization) from Judeo-Christian values. If you think like this Hitler could have also said I don't care what the rest of the world says those are my values and I need no moral highground like you said to tell you in my opnion what is right or wrong

""Because we're not them, don't live in their situation, and it's  functionally-impossible for one people to ""take"" the society of another  like putting on clothes.""

Exactly...you live (I think at least) in a western society with those moral values that's why your's (even if you claim that they are not linked to the Judeo-christian ones) match them so I don't know what you point here is...

 ""Except ""why"" isn't a counter for any of it. It's a chance to examine and elucidate, and is not something to be feared.

And  you haven't actually done that. You've instead tried to push a  short-term racist theory of benefit, which falls apart on its face.

Additionally,  literally no-one here has claimed moral high ground, or perfection.  That's a reaction you're having because of your need for morality to  descend from authority.""

Except it is if you can't back it up with anything. You are just saying those are my believes and that's it with no backup whatsoever.

You can say that you think that this is and that is good or wrong but you get your concept of good and wrong from Judeo-christian values and you can't deny that. And although some other societies have similiar moral values your's don't derive from them of course I say again if you live in a western society. And I'm not saying Atheist can't have moral values but there is no reason to be moral if there is no God because there is not a standard what moral is without God and what it should be like. It is basically pointless to have moral values rationally thinking and that what this argument is about. Why was it not moral what Hitler, Stalin, Mao Tse Tong and many other evil dictators did when you have no backup of morality. The best you could say is I don't think it's good but this is not universally correct so their moral vaules can be quite as good or bad as mine and by not saying that you indeed claimed moral highground. 

"" When morality doesn't descend from authority, this childish need to  jockey for moral position (""higher"" vs ""lower"", ""better"" vs ""worse"",  ""perfect"" vs ""imperfect"", etc)  ""

Here you said it yourself. You don't need this ""childish jockey for moral position"" so this shuts down your own argument that you need morals at all because it doesn't make sense to have some if there is no God.

""Including, of course, God. ""

Right buddy...

""Pro-tip: more exclamation points do not make your argument stronger. They just make you look desperate. ""

Pro-Tip #2: Sorry I didn't know we are writing on the New York Times rather than reddit.

PS: haven't even seen your comment from you post before: "" (and we're left in the fun position of having the religious people argue *in favor* *of Hitler*, which is always a good time for all concerned.) ""

Again I must say almost ""pathetic"" attempt...Where have I argued in favor of Hitler ? This post is about why was it wrong what Hitler did without the concept of God and all you did was sounding like a good christian but dismissing that your moral values come from God. Why is it so hard to acknowledge that your perception of good and wrong come from Juedeo-Christian values ? As I said above you can live and acknowledge those values as your own without believing in God this is you right to do. But this is just Anti-theism you are preaching trying desperatly to prove that they are not coming from those values.

Says you. But what a lot of the uppity portion of Northerners don't understand is its subjective. I think Pro 14 is utter dogshit as a spectacle, but I know it does the job just fine for many people.

&gt; Is it any wonder that you can't retain players if you play half as many games

If you honestly think that is the reason why a lot of players leave to Europe or Japan, you have failed at basic economics.

&gt; NZRU neglects every opportunity to maximise revenue (or get anywhere close) by playing in places like Nelson, population 3 men, 5 sheep, and a dog.

You do understand ticket sales at venues make up a very small portion of what NZRU rakes in? And evidently, they care more about their fan base than what you're accustomed to by playing in smaller locations.

Honestly after that rant and all the effort you put into suggesting ns on ""fixing"" someone else's shit, you should take a long hard look at yourself before providing that advice.

Have a car?  


In 2014 I drove down from Chicago in the dead of winter.. 30 days of freezing temps in a row.. down to Miami.. 


I was thinking it would be about a month trip..


Then went on a couple of cruises.. 


Got into sailing..


Decided to go to Disney World.. then New Orleans.. then Texas.. then LA.. then more sailing all over the Caribbean.... more cruises..


I ended up driving to around 35 states.. ALL car camping 
( r./urbancardwelling r/vandwelling r/priusdwelling )


More sailing in Europe.. and even more cruises 


Now I've spent the past 7 months in 7 countries backpacking around Asia with 
a small 21l backpack and plan to go to around 6-10 other countries the rest of this year..  here in Vietnam now and headed to the Philippines tomorrow.


I don't have any plans on stopping to be honest..  next obtainable goal is to visit 100 countries.. and then maybe try and see all 195 in the world.  But I don't take that seriously until I get to 100 first. 


Also debating on circumnavigating the world by sailboat .. but idk - it's also a huge undertaking..


I started off just going on a month long ""road trip"" .. and the rest..  just kinda happened..


Almost got killed by a deer about 6 years ago.. since then my thoughts on life and what's important changed even more.. you never know when it's your time..


""  Twenty Years From Now You Will Be More Disappointed By The Things You Didn’t Do Than By The Ones You Did Do  ""    


I quit a business making around $350K a year.. working 100 hours a week and I hated my life.. money isn't everything.. 

Now I stay in the cheapest hostels available, eat cheap street food, take the bus over a flight even if it only saves me $10.. 

I know this doesn't make sense to some, but $1 I save today is $1 I can spend tomorrow..  

I'm way happier living this way and out there seeing the world living my frugal life than I was driving around one of my luxury or exotic cars trying to impress others.  

I've had an amazing life ever since.. and it's just getting better.. 

Only been traveling 5 years but it's been the most fun and incredibly rewarding.

Shortly : you are kind of** wrong because you are looking from a wrong perspective and possibly don't know much about Turkey.

Long version : I mean, 4 million people from any parts of the world would have some kind of effects unfortunately. Though you are probably right in a sense, general sentiment towards refugees have become worse. Though I also think Turkish people have proven how accepting they are and even with raising tensions I wouldn't call them hateful or xenophobic. Name me a country that can take 4 million refugees while having a economic crisis and not have major riots. Europe is quite strong economically and even they lost their shit for few thousand refugees. Most of the negativity in Turkey are still localized and pretty mild.

I wouldn't call it a war between seculars and non-seculars because those definitions have become inadequate to understand people long time ago. It is only foreigners who only follow Turkey from western media who think that way. There are many other dynamics within Turkey right now and secularism is only a small part of it. I would say recent issues are mostly oriented around freedom of expression, law, media etc.

Speaking about western media: I wouldn't call Turkish became hateful towards Europe but I would say they have become more disillusioned. That is due to everyone from every demographic in Turkey realizing how Europeans(media, politicians) don't understand Turkey at all. I think this is a good thing because ultimately it is the peoples job to make things right. I think it is best people in Turkey realize they aren't gonna get any free help from EU/US/Russia or any other parts of the world.

I don't think the UK gets a good return on investment from primary and secondary education. I think 18 year olds in Ireland have a better basic skill set than their counterparts in the UK. I base this on the quality of school leavers and graduates from NI as compared to primarily Dublin.

Secondly - there are no hard right or hard left political parties in Ireland of particular note. We have two main centre parties, we have Sinn Fein which is somewhat left and a bit populist and we have labour who are centre left and not populist.

We have proportional representation instead of first passed the post so parliament is full of independents. We have independent government ministers.

We have no history of Euroscepticism as a political platform.

We do not have right or left wing popular press. We have rags, but broadsheet media in Ireland is neither right nor left nor leans obviously to one party.

The Irish edition of the mail and the UK version of the mail are a good example of the differences. Both total rags but the Irish mail is just full of lowest common denominator stuff - the dailymail is total propaganda.

Try living in Britain and working in what is technically unskilled labour, watching your wage stagnate, or skilled labour with an influx of competition able to work more cheaply then you because their family is back in Poland so supporting them costs less.

Travelling through a place is awesome, but it doesn't give you enough experience to start making judgement calls on the country, or the decisions made by the people living and working there effected by EU membership in their everyday life.

Your ease of travel plays second fiddle to that.

The problem is that servers stops accepting new players from matchmaking after changing map. So you are forced to leave the server and find a new match or continue playing in a match that probably ends up in a draw because of the time limit. This seems to start happening when the amount of players starts dropping (around 21:30-22:00 CET here in Europe). 


This is a good thing since they can shut down servers during the night (costs less money) and focus the player base into a smaller amount of servers. But it also sucks for us players since we have to leave the server and search a new match. Our record is switching server 5 or 6 times during a Friday night because of this. And if you are unlucky you end up playing the same maps over and over again. And if you are more than 4 people playing together... have fun.

tdzida26,1420477918.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_kiyiq,False,"&gt;Yea dude get fucked with your “Muslims are the victim” nonsense. Muslims invaded and nearly conquered all of Spain. They wiped out Byzantine Christianity not to even mention what they did to Jews.

Byzantine Empire was weakened by fighting against the Muslim Turks, other European christian countries and by civil wars, the Ottomans were the one who managed to conquer Constantinople in the end, and the downfall of the Byzantine Empire didn't occur in just 1 year it has gradually falling for hundreds of years, most notably it has never recovered from the forth crusade.

Most conquests of the early muslim Empire were due to economic reasons not religious. Most people could keep their religion but that meant that they needed to pay taxes for it. When the crusades conquered Jerusalem there was a large chrisitian and jewish population living there, and if I'm not mistaken Jews had it much better in the Muslim Empire than in Europe. The Roman population that was conquered was allowed to keep their faith and a lot of Roman administrators worked for the Umayyad Calipate after thhe conquest.

&gt;Islam is an ideological plague. I’m not even Christian but look at Mohammed. He was a conquering warlord who enslaved women and turned them into sex slaves. He married a fucking six year old. But don’t worry. He didn’t fuck her till she was 9. Women aren’t even fertile at 9 so don’t come at me with “people were different back then”.

Unlike Christianity which also had the biggest slave trade in the world, but whatever my feelings as a Chrisitian are hurt so I need a scapegoat. I know that Muhamed was a shitty person, but so were most of the Christian figures and leaders. Religion is irrational and causes people do to stupid shit no matter Christianity or Islam. You also love to forget that Christians spread their religion by the sword as well, but I guess you are biased so that doesn't matter.

Obviously no one knows the kind of trade deal the UK will have with the EU post Brexit - the tariffs may be low or there may be none at all, like the Canada deal. In my opinion, unless tariffs are high, Scotland would absolutely be better off in the SM&amp;CU - though even with high tariffs, there's an argument to be made that hitching our wagon to the EU, instead of an economically diminishing UK, would be better for us in the long term. I've been following reaction to Brexit on the island of Ireland and, let's face it, there's a growing chance the UK might not even contain Northern Ireland in a few years, so we'd be damaging our European and world trade (including our £5 billion a year whisky industry) for the sake of inner trade with just England and Wales. Maybe that is the better option short term, but I can't see that being good for our economy in the long run, though these are all things that will be fiercely debated. Obviously Ireland's trade is currently quite heavily tied to the UK (though Belgium, as I understand, is a bigger export market for you). If you had to choose between a deal with the UK at the (potential) expense of tariff free trade with the EU and the guaranteed loss all of all the deal's the EU has struck with other countries/trading blocs, what would you do? What do you think would be best for Ireland?

While you're here, can I just apologise for the absolutely atrocious arrogance and ignorance the UK is displaying towards your island. I had no idea people were so clueless about Irish history. I like to think people are just so uncomfortable and ashamed with Britain's role that they stick their heads in the sand, but when you see how unfathomably proud some people are of the British empire - the exploitation, the famine, the slavery, the genocide - you realise it's probably not that. I'm absolutely fed up to my back teeth of having to explain to my English family why the GFA is a delicate balancing act and why the border absolutely jeopardises that.

Here is TW:3k, a soon to be released aaa title.

https://steamdb.info/app/779340/
Indian Rupee	₹ 1999	$28.02 (cheapest at 28.02 usd) 
U.S. Dollar	$59.99 $59.99 (usd is the baseline) 
Euro	59,99€	$68.80 (EU price)

What higher consumer protection for games via steam does India lack and Euro have? No really, there could be some regulations so I wouldn't be surprised if there is a difference but I'm unaware.

Following that, EU price is 245% more expensive. Pray tell how paying more than twice the price actually is protecting the customer more. Is whatever higher level of consumer protection worth paying two and a half times more? For the same product byte by byte.


Myself, I remember WarCraft3 coming out many years ago and it was priced at about 30% my country minimum wage.
Using usa min wage as a baseline at uss7.25, its akin to newly release war3 (or a new aaa game) costing usd365.40 today (7.25 x 8hr x 21days *30%). So yes, lower pricing is a thing that is gonna break Epic if they dont do regional pricing.

unrasierterphilosoph,1523631665.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_16s79mtd,False,"The footsoldiers of the Wehrmacht were tough cookies (unlike the imperial stormtroopers, the ones of the FO are actually made of stronger stuff), and they had a couple of excellent generals.

But not only did they have ten stuffed uniforms for every really good one at least, Hitler overrode their decisions and forced them to do all kinds of useless and counterproductive stuff, in various situations for no other reason than to remind them that he was in charge.

I think you are wildly inaccurate about a whole lot of historical facts, but it's probably better not to get bogged down in a discussion that would probably turn too political soon.

I think it is worth remembering that the Resistance is not a real army though, and it was never capable nor supposed to fight and defeat the FO in a real war.

Strictly speaking they were a small paramilitary terrorist group, operating ouside of Republic law, trying to disturb operations of the FO on a small scale, to slow them down a bit, and at the same time finding proof of their plan to invade the Republic, to stirr the Republic up to make itself ready for battle, and give it some more time for preparation.

But is was not by itself a serious military threat in the eyes of the FO.

They had destroyed SKB, yes, but that did nothing to make them more of an opponent in a regular war.

Besides Hux's desire to punish them for that offense, the Resistance itself was relevant to Snoke only for two reasons, namely Leia and her status as a legendary hero and symbolic figure, and still more important, through her, the connection to Skywalker.

The Resistance is the equivalent of a small partisan group, not the french or much less soviet army.

Which reminds me that Hitler is on record saying that he hoped that there would be partisans and occasional uprisings for decades to come in conquered eastern europe, so that generations of german soldiers and officers would be able to gain combat experience and learn to be ""real men"" there, also of Moff Jejerrod in the original RotJ novelisation, who quite liked the Rebellion, likening it to a small boy he could torment to his heart's content, until the boy suddenly broke his chains, and suddenly the game was no longer fun.

That was by the way one of the many big blunders as well, that the Nazis were so insanely cruel and racist that they managed to turn even people who hated the Soviets with a burning passion against themselves.

Of course the Rebellion was also just a pretty small partisan movement, even if much larger and more widespread than the Resistance, but still, seeing as such movements have rarely achieved very much without massive outside assistance by a greater outside power, which was not the case with the rebels of course, the Empire being the only galactic super power, it was always very unrealistic that they won, much less the way it was portrayed.

But in the end the Nazis never had a real chance to win the war, because their opponents had many times the amount of human reserves, natural resources and industrial capacities, even capturing some russian oil fields would never have been enough to change that.

They had fine weapons, but only the resources and capacity to build and field a comparatively tiny amount of them, the Wehrmacht had far to little equipment from day one, and the german generals knew exactly that they would run out of pretty much everything very soon, but the fanatical ideologues were convinced that the Soviet System would quickly collapse like a house of cards. They were wrong, and the rest is history.

This is a problem that I suspect the FO will be confronted with as well.

I'm sorry, don't want to offend your father, but I cannot take anyone seriously who unironically uses the term ""emo"" the way you described.

But in any case, it is just factually wrong. Considering that Kylo could have quite easily killed Rey if he had chosen to do so, even in his severly weakened state, until the Cosmic Force intervened to give her a power boost, there is just no logical reason why he would not be able to beat her (and he almost certainly will, but spare her).

One is tempted to say that that is not how the Force, or even fighting in real life, works.

You are right that Kylo's position in the story is a bit murky, he is after all a character that is only in the process of fully coming into his own, after all.

Which among other things includes finding his own balance and realizing the full extent of his power.

Yes, I think he will almost certainly come down on the side of anti hero eventually, but that does not prevent him from acting as opponent as first, and mark my words, he will turn out to more dangerous than Snoke and Vader together.

We will follow his journey and his struggles, because the narrative will treat him not as an obstacle to Rey and co, but as the protagonist of his own story, even if on the oposing side, as TLJ as already started to do, something that will only be intensified in episode IX.

And that process of coming into his own of a Kylo eager to prove himself, will of course involve crushing various enemies into the ground (both inside and ourside the FO) and gaining increasing power, politically, militarily and in the Force, free of masters that belittled him and held him back.

But in the end, the tension will not primarily come from a fight scene.

After all, the confrontation between Luke and Vader in RotJ drew nothing of it's intensity from the question of who the better fighter was (though one could argue that Vader pretty much ""went down like a bitch""), and the Emperor died without much fanfare after Anakin Skywalker had won his much more significant internal struggle.

Kylo and Rey have been portrayed as equals in the Force, but at their strongest when they are on the same side, and it has been hinted that the Cosmic Force does not want them to kill each other, probably because there is something important that it wants them to do, that they can only achieve working together.

So while I think they will fight one more time, with probably Rey the aggressor and the one who wants to kill, and Kylo being the winner and the balanced one, in the end it will probably be more about finding a way to avoid and minimize the fighting and killing.

CreeperCooper,1409668403.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_i6v8v,False,"&gt; If she doesn't like being in this position then she should fucking resign. Nobody is making her.

&gt;She called an election to strengthen her majority and it failed. She should have resigned then.

Resigning wouldn't do her any favors, either. The hate she gets is unbelievable right now, wait till she 'abandons' her position. 

Who would replace her that would do a better job? Who would replace her that makes sure one side doesn't goes into a rage? Who would even WANT that job? No one. 

""This **candidate** ofcourse, the one that has *my* opinion!"", yes. Exactly... That's what everyone thinks.

She is not the prime minister you want, but she is most certainly the only one able to do the job. 

&gt;She revoked Article 50 without any plan whatsoever.

She was hated for waiting too long on invoking Article 50. Remember, the referendum results were announced **24 June, 2016**. Article 50 was invoked on **29 March 2017**.

Damned if you do, damned if you don't. You hate her for not taking enough time and form a plan (with a government divided and unwilling to make one at all!) and someone else hates her for taking too long to invoke the article (""We won the vote! Get on with it already! Traitor!""). 

Again, it doesn't matter what she does. The United Kingdom has a population of 66 million babies, all throwing a tantrum because they don't get it exactly how they want it, when they want it.

&gt;You say she is trying to please both remainers and leavers whereas the only people happy right now are people who want to see the EU fail? IE. Russia and America.

No one is happy in the UK, I never said that remainers and brexiteers were *happy*. I said she is trying to please both sides, which she has been doing with every step she makes. 

The Brits can't be made happy, they are British after all. 

&gt;You think democracy will be kept if we follow the advice from a non-binding referendum in which both sides cheated nearly two years ago now?

The referendum is 'non-binding' in a legal sense, not a political one. That's the entire problem with 'non-binding' referendums. The political parties can't ignore a referendum without being called out by everyone who voted leave. Going against the referendum vote would literally anger half of the UK and make sure their party crashes and burns. 

There is no such thing as a 'non-binding' referendum. The parties will have to act out the results anyway. Not because of legal reasons, but because they will (permanently) lose a majority of their voters. 

&gt;Do you know what democracy is?

Yes, I do. The people voted to leave, and the government will try anything they can to accomplish that wish so they will not be punished in the elections or get a sign with permanent marker: 'undemocratic' on their necks. 

Want to be angry about the result? Be angry at politicians who lied, be angry at the media for lying. Be angry at the masses of British adult babies voting the most stupendous option they had available. 

If you believed leaving was going to be a good choice at the time of the referendum, you might need to open your goddamn eyes. Anyone looking at the situation objectively in 2015/2016 would've been able to tell that leaving was dumb.

Don't be angry at May, she didn't want to leave in the first place.

J'ai le même modèle chez moi. Super médecin de manière générale, mais systématiquement en retard. J'ai tout tenté : prendre rendez-vous pour être le premier, pour être juste après l'heure de table, rien à faire. Tu as rendez vous à 14h, il te fait entrer a 14h45, les jours ou ça va bien. 

J'ai pris le pli, si je dois aller chez le médecin, j'y vais tout de même pour l'heure convenue - sait-on jamais - mais je prend mes dispositions : mon smartphone chargé, mes écouteurs, ou un livre. 

J'ai aussi pris conscience que je préférais un médecin systématiquement en retard qui prend le temps de bien faire/dire/expliquer que d'en avoir un qui expédie chaque patient pour ne pas prendre de retard.

&gt; Et c'est en partie le pourquoi d'être chez mon médecin aujourd'hui. Il y a des hauts, et des bas.

J'ai eu la même démarche il y a quelques mois. J'ai fini par trouver un équilibre en m'organisant mieux que précédemment. C'est un effort qui n'est pas toujours facile mais qui s'avère payant sur le moyen terme.

From your very post comment in this thread:

""Anti-zionism is the belief that **Jews do not have land ownership rights. It's one of the oldest versions of anti-semitism with a new name.**""

Is that not an argument that old Europeans were antisemities for not giving the Jews in Europe full rights to own lands? I.e. they were denied jus soli? Or did you just stumble on to that by accident? If so, look up the Jewish emancipation.

If the language has modern descendants or relatives, we can compare those languages to reconstruct the sound system of the ancient language. (For example, Proto-Indo-European is the common ancestor of most European and many south Asian languages. Although there are no written records, it has been reconstructed by comparing modern and knowm Ancient languages. It started a few centuries ago when people noticed that Latin, Ancient Greek, and Sanskrit are so similar they must be related.) Sometimes, we can look at words borrowed from a known language into an ancient language. This is how we know what Sumerian and Proto-Basque sounded like. Also, just looking at the writing system can tell you roughly how many sounds the language had, which is also helpful to know.

I don't know the specifics for Phoenician, but it has modern relatives such as Hebrew and Arabic, so those were probably good to look at.

My point is that only 2 (maybe 3) countries on the planet have complete single-payer primary care with no private options and the biggest are us and Taiwan. And we're not leading the world in healthcare. The UK, most of Europe, Australia, etc... all have either hybrid tiers or private options that still fund the public one. (The difference in USA is that private options do not fund the public ones, which is why the US approach to healthcare is so broken and expensive).

When you have private options it can take some of the load off the public system, and those using private options are still funding public healthcare. It can (and does in those examples) lead to improved healthcare for everyone - but I do admit it's still a moral issue of allowing different levels of access. However I think the pragmatic approach is best, and also it's important to define what can be done privately. There shouldn't be different levels of access for serious things/conditions. But something like waiting to see an ENT because I have a cyst or something. That already sucks, I had to wait 18 months to see one here, and if people who are rich pay extra to see one shorter, and in turn the public system has less load and things improve, I'm all for it.

Unfortunately in these kinds of discussions Canadians seem to refuse to look past the for profit examples in the US as if they're the only other approach than what we're currently doing. All they do is fear monger and we'll never go beyond our status quo of being near the bottom of all developed countries.

And for the record I am (usually) a NDP voter, I believe Canada should have universal pharmacare, dental care, visioncare, etc..., even that feminine hygeine products should be covered for low income people.

Trump würde ich jetzt alles zutrauen. Sind also noch UK und FR als wesentliche atomare Freunde übrig. UK verabschiedet sich aber momentan schon ein wenig von uns, wobei die Zusammenarbeit im verteidigungs- und sicherheitspolitischen Bereich hoffentlich erhalten bleibt. Mit Frankreich sieht es gut aus, aber Le Pen ist jetzt auch nicht ausgeschlossen, und wie es dann aussähe, weiß ich nicht.

Ich bin für weitere Zusammenarbeit bei der Verteidigung (auch mit Le Pen o.ä., und auch nach dem Brexit), aber wenn die andere Seite das nicht mehr möchte, stehen wir doof da. Daher wäre ich dafür, dass wir uns auch atomar bewaffnen. Gern so, dass die Waffen auch zusätzlich unter Kontrolle der EU stehen und somit garantiert auch zur Verteidigung Estlands oder Polens eingesetzt werden könnten.

\&gt; Of course we don't know exactly what would have happened 

Yes we do, Yes just like to maintain this false hope.  Here are some of requirements for membership of the EU.  I draw your attention to Criteria section, part 2; Government budget deficit.  It clearly states EU members annual deficit must not exceed 3% of GDP in the current year or for the 2 preceding years.

Here are Scotlands figures

[https://www.gov.scot/publications/government-expenditure-revenue-scotland-2017-18/](https://www.gov.scot/publications/government-expenditure-revenue-scotland-2017-18/)

See Table S.5 - Current budget balance.

In 2014 during the indyref, our budget deficit was running at -8.9%.  8.9 &gt; 3.  Even now, we're running at -6.8%.  We do not meet and have never came close to meeting the entry requirements for budget deficit because we spend more than we earn.  People lie, numbers don't.  Sturgeon may stand up and tell you it'll be fine, we'd be members, she'll negotiate it.  Just like May said it's fine, we'll negotiate a Brexit deal.

&amp;#x200B;

That's just one of the criteria, we don't pass multiple of them.  It's why they gloss over it with ""it'll be fine, we'll figure it out.  I'll get us membership"".  Aye, just like May promised to negotiate a good deal on Brexit.  When will we finally learn we can't vote based on empty promises.  Fact and figures should steer the country.

The only hope first time round was maybe, from the goodness of their heart, the EU would allow us a rolling membership due to being previous members with the UK.  However, Spain would likely piss all over that to try to not give Catalonia any ideas about Indy too.

""a **persistent organic pollutant** that is readily adsorbed to soils and sediments, which can act both as sinks and as **long-term sources of exposure** affecting organisms.""

""Because of its lipophilic properties, **DDT can bioaccumulate**, especially in predatory birds.""

""DDT is **toxic to a wide range of living organisms, including marine animals such as crayfish, daphnids, sea shrimp and many species of fish**.""

""In the United States, these chemicals were **detected in almost all human blood samples** tested by the Centers for Disease Control in 2005, though their levels have **sharply declined since most uses were banned.**""

""The chemical and its breakdown products DDE and DDD **caused** eggshell thinning and **population declines in multiple North American and European bird of prey species**.  
DDE-related eggshell thinning is **considered a major reason for the decline of the bald eagle, brown pelican, peregrine falcon and osprey.**""

[\[source: literally just wikipedia, it was that easy.\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDT#Environmental_impact)

---

Importantly, for those that don't care about the environment and have no understanding of the value of birds of prey to the larger ecosystem:  

""Although DDT is generally not toxic to human beings and was banned mainly for ecological reasons, **subsequent research has shown that exposure to DDT at amounts that would be needed in malaria control might cause preterm birth and early weaning, abrogating the benefit of reducing infant mortality** from malaria.""  
[\[source: The Lancet\]](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(05\)67182-6/fulltext)

""Indirect exposure of mothers through workers directly in contact with **DDT is associated with an increase in spontaneous abortions**""  
[\[source: Center for Reproductive Medicine\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3527168)

DDT/DDE is also an endocrine disruptor, and consequently associated with endocrine disorders. It is also considered carcinogenic.  
Its presence in breast milk is thus cause for concern.

&gt; They actually don't, because Egyptians are actually honest and say that Egypt is their homeland. I don't think you know what ""homeland"" means.

Because egyptians have better things to do, point is still standing: they had control over the land way before the jews formed a collective identity. And longer as well. They have a very good case to call it their homeland.

&gt; ""Zionist terrorists"" are Jews, and Jews are indigenous to Palestine. Unlike Arabs.

According to your own rhetoric, so arab jews are not indigenous? The jewish palestinians that married non-jewish palestinians are not indigenous (and their kids)?

I can't actually believe that you think people from europe have more claim to the land then people who actually lived their all their lives (or at least an equal claim). Jew or not.

&gt; Jews don't have the right of self-determination in their ancient homeland? Thanks for finally indicating the anti-Jewish rights nature of the pro-Palestine movement.

What does this mean?
So if present day other semitic tribes like the Jebusites, Amorites, Girgasites, Hivites, Arkites, Sinites, Arvadites, Zemarites, and the Hamathites were still alive (and not genocided or extinct) and for example they lived in america or europe they now could all go on a mass conquest to Palestine/Israel and declare that its their land? (Out of self determination).

Stop this victim complex act of making it all about the jews, when you know darn well that taking over land based on historical nonsense is ridicilous indepedent of the ethnicity of the people. Like I said earlier, 90% of the people would now suddenly have a claim to foreign land that they never have been to.

&gt; Poor poor Palestinians who started the war to drive the Jews into the sea and lost. If they hadn't started the war, they wouldn't have lost a single solitary thing. Palestine wasn't their land, it was British land, and before that it was Ottoman land. For the first time in centuries the Arabs could have self-determined in Palestine, but they threw it away because they, like you, would prefer Jews be denied self-determination than have self-determination themselves.

I mean the zionists started that war in every aspect possible when they decided to make 3% minority into a 32% of the entire population within less than 30 years, were actively terrorizing the people, stealing the land and then got 56% of the land in a unfair partition plan. Any people would've rejected that and defended themselves, there is absolutely zero reason for the majority of the inhabitants to give the bigger part of the land to a small minority + immigrants. I wouldn't call 'offering' 44% of the land to the majority any form of self determination, I would call it a big sham and a con deal, just like your founding father said by the way. And you guys call the UN biased? Biased in your favor yeah, lol.

&gt; I haven't murdered any children. Reported.

You called me an antisemite, denied the Nakba and other bs. Reported.

All 3 don’t rely on other countries for military: they are a part of NATO. They just don’t waste money on waging expensive wars. 


Yes, NATO with it's pathetic 2% GDP mandate is what's keeping them from needing to spend realistic amounts of money on their defense. 


&gt;Home ownership rates of Norway are at 83%. 77% of Icelanders. The US is comparable with Denmark at 63/64%. What are you talking about?

Sorry it's been quite some time since I last had this discussion. Got some figures jumbled. 

&gt;And car ownership is not a sign of wealth, but debt.

No. Car ownership is something which can be achieved with debt, but to state that people are too poor to buy cars and have to deal with staggering &gt;200% ""luxury"" taxes on cars but that's okay because they don't buy them on credit is a facile argument. 

&gt;Lastly, the very same OCED you use as an example for dispense income pitches Denmark as one of the happiest countries in the world. Is that a facile propaganda with an tends to push? If so, your own stats don’t hold up.

UnableFaithlessness,1535386132.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_22pv39zg,False,"&gt; I'm not comparing that. The population of the United States all came from groups that were assimilated into an American identity. There was no pre-existing American identity from which it emerged. Regularly large groups of people are taken in and assimilated.

There was a preexisting American identity: the post-British Empire Anglo identity. This eventually transitioned towards a ""white Christian"" identity and is currently transitioning towards something new. An empire can assimilate many small minority populations over generations; this takes a long time and small discrete minority groups.

&gt;The Yishuv had groups of people with almost nothing in common who had strong ethnic tensions between them. Russian Jews and Polish Jews fought. Lithuanian Jews had separate institutions which still exist. Yet within a few decades they had almost no distinctions. The Israeli identity is vastly stronger.

This is similar to the transition from the American Anglo identity to the white Christian one, which occurred due to the twin factors of (1) immense antiblack institutional racism and (2) significant German and other white European immigration during the 19th century.

Israel isn't a Mizrahi or Ashkie or whatever society. The different Jewish groups in Israel could not fully dominate any other; as such, it is a new kind of Jewish society. But the incorporation of a 40% Palestinian Arab minority *will* end the Jewish nature of Israel by this same process.

&gt;I've read the people around Rivlin Federal plan based on the Brazil model. I haven't read his confederation plan you are talking about.

[""Rivlin proposes Israeli-Palestinian ‘confederation’: President floats idea of two states with borders including land swaps, as well as separate parliaments, but only one army.""](https://www.timesofisrael.com/rivlin-proposes-israeli-palestinian-confederation/) Etc.

&gt;What happens if the first act of the Pennsylvania legislature is to dissolve itself into the wider New York legal system? The answer is it isn't possible. Pennsylvania doesn't have that power over New York. If it dissolves itself then it just becomes an unincorporated territory of the United States which means residents can't vote at the national level. That's all. These things can happen gradually so that the types of bad faith acts you propose are impossible or if they are done they are simply countermanded by a higher checking authority.

Sure, let's diminish Israel's sovereignty in the same way that American states have lost their sovereignty. What could possibly go wrong? It's not like the Supremacy Clause of the Federal government is a thing or anything. /s

You're still forgetting that all citizens of the US (whether they live in a state or a territory) have the Constitutionally guaranteed right to citizenship in any state depending on their residency. There is literally nothing stopping the entire population of any state (or unincorporated territory) from moving to another state to change that state's politics. [It's actively being advocated for in some circles.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_State_Project) 

""I would like to end Zionism and Jewish national self-determination because the whole world should look like America"" is ... insane. You're not advocating for a Zionist position. This is American anti-Zionism in its purest form.

&gt;States within the federal system don't have citizenship that's national. When it dissolves itself the residency laws are dissolved.

What does this statement even mean. The people born in an American unincorporated territory have federal citizenship.

&gt;You are ignoring the new aspects like the focus on economics. You are mixing the quotes freely together. The new attitudes are what's interesting. 

You are continuing to ignore that this new ""focus on economics"" is, in the 'new attitude', coterminous to their desire for Palestinian Arab dominance in a future state, and that Palestinian advocates for one single state see their economic integration as a step towards said domination. It's very explicit in the report.

I am not mixing quotes freely together. I quoted specific sections of the report that you are intentionally ignoring. 

&gt;I'm not advocating for a binational state. I don't support binationalism. I support assimilation. The grandchildren or great grandchildren of today's Palestinians are Hebrew speaking Jews.

&gt; Ariana Grande (born Ariana Grande-Butera, June 26, 1993 in Boca Raton, Florida, United States), is an American Grammy award-nominated actress, singer, and songwriter.

&gt; She was born to graphic designer Edward Butera and Joan Grande (the CEO of Hose-McCann Communications), Grande began singing and acting at an early age, appearing in local theater productions. In 2008, when she was 15 years old, she landed the role of Charlotte in the Broadway production of 13; her performance was well-received, winning a National Youth Theatre Association Award. Following an appearance in the 2010 Desmond Child-written musical Cuba Libre, Grande was cast as Cat Valentine in the Nickelodeon television program Victorious. The show ran until 2012, at which time Grande's Cat Valentine was spun off into a show called Sam &amp; Cat, which also starred Jennette McCurdy of iCarly.

&gt; As she kept herself busy with television, Grande began to pursue a musical career. She frequently made appearances at sporting events and with symphonies, and she made her first appearances on record via the soundtracks to Victorious. In 2011, she released the single ""Put Your Hearts Up,"" which was cut during sessions for a teen-oriented pop album; she later disowned the single due to its kiddie feel. Grande felt much more comfortable with ""The Way,"" her 2013 single featuring Mac Miller. This signaled a mature direction and audiences responded, taking it to the Top Ten in the U.S., where it was eventually certified triple platinum. It was the first single from her 2013 debut, Yours Truly, which also featured hits in ""Baby I"" and ""Right There.""

&gt; At the end of the year she released a seasonal EP called Christmas Kisses, but her real efforts went into the recording of her second album, My Everything. Preceded by the single ""Problem"" -- a song that featured a guest spot from Iggy Azalea, the ""it girl"" of the summer of 2014; it peaked at two on the U.S. charts and was certified double platinum -- the album featured a host of different producers, including Max Martin, Shellback, Ryan Tedder, and Benny Blanco. It was released at the end of August 2014, hitting number one on charts across the globe. Subsequent singles featured assists by Zedd (""Break Free""), Jessie J and Nicki Minaj (""Bang Bang""), and The Weeknd (""Love Me Harder""). At one point in 2014, three of her songs were in the Billboard Top Ten at the same time, a feat matched only be Adele. By the time fifth single ""One Last Time"" charted in early 2015, My Everything had sold nearly 600,000 copies.

&gt; As that album's cycle wound down, Grande guest-starred on Ryan Murphy's campy slasher series Scream Queens and she also recorded another holiday EP, Christmas &amp; Chill. In October 2015, Grande released the single ""Focus,"" which debuted at number seven on the Hot 100 and was certified platinum the following January. That February, she announced her third album, Dangerous Woman, and released the album's title track as a single in March. The song hit number eight on the Hot 100, making Grande the first artist to have the lead single from each of her first three albums debut in the Top Ten. Featuring collaborations with Macy Gray, Future, and Nicki Minaj, the album appeared in May 2016 and debuted at number two. It eventually went platinum, helped by a trio of Top Ten hits and a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album. Grande began 2017 by duetting with John Legend on ""Beauty and the Beast,"" the title track for Disney's live-action remake of their 1991 animated classic. She then mounted her Dangerous Woman Tour, performing across North America and Europe during the first half of 2017.

&gt; Tragedy struck on May 22, 2017, when a suicide bomber attacked Grande's concert at the Manchester Arena in Manchester, England. Grande returned to performing on June 4, when she held a star-studded charity concert called One Love Manchester to aid the victims of the bombing. Following the show, she resumed the Dangerous Woman Tour, which concluded in Hong Kong that September.

&gt; In April 2018, Grande kicked off promotion for her fourth album, Sweetener, by issuing the single ""No Tears Left to Cry,"" which debuted at number three on the Hot 100. She then collaborated with several other artists like Nicki Minaj and Troye Sivan before releasing Sweetener. She released the single ""Thank U, Next"" for her 5th studio album later that year in November. The single became Grande's first #1 on the Hot 100 subsequently, and also broke many streaming records.

CytheYounger,1476480354.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_124gtn,False,"&gt;So you're essentially saying human corruption and desire for power and all of the injustices that come with it are only attributable to an individualistic society and not a community-based one?

No, I'm not.

&gt;If that was the case, then individualistic societies would never have  been created in the first place. **And communism in all of it's examples  would have worked out.**

What are you talking about? Communism is quite literally based off of the village or tribe, small communities that owned their means of production, like commons. Complex and Nomadic foraging was basically the default mode of human social organization for most of of our history.

&gt;This is why Marxists argued that “primitive communism” was the original  form of property ownership, i.e. socialism. Historically, this is  correct. The problem was that this was predicated upon extended kinship  networks and not large, industrial, nation states, composed of  strangers. That is, *primitive communism does not scale*, which is why market economies came to supplant them over time.

There is a big difference between **Communitarianism** and **Collectivism.** The Communism you're thinking of, is industrial powered, centralized and Authoritarian. It's got the masses and the elites, it's Collectivist. That's not what I'm talking about.

&gt;All it takes is one influential individual with a lust for power and  control and you get what you have here today - regardless of the system  the individual was brought up in.

In our society yes, but that shit doesn't fly in certain tribal societies, who were fiercely egalitarian. You didn't become leader because you wanted to, you were followed. And if people chose to, they would simply stop following you if they didn't like it. If you wanted to lead a hunt, fine, but people only would follow you if you were considered a good hunter, not because you thought you were a good hunter. I mean look at the Big Man feast in complex foraging societies, that was all about status and power, but they achieved that by redistribution of resources, the Potlatch. And it could easily be taken away if they turned into selfish petty assholes. In Anthropology this is called leveling mechanisms.

Anyways I'm too lazy to write anymore so here's a good take down of the Pop Anthropology that gets bandied about when shit like this comes up.

&gt;At it’s heart, it is an attempt to “erase” or “rewrite” the past for  the sake of present circumstances. As one of it’s earliest descriptions [had it](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/retcon-history-and-meaning), *“retroactive continuity ultimately means that history flows fundamentally from the future into the past.”*  
&gt;  
&gt;What’s any of this got to do with history? It strikes me that much of  what we learn about history are attempts to “retcon” the past.  
&gt;  
&gt;What do I mean by this? It seems that history often adopts a “modern”  point of view to explain past events. In this narrative, we were always  heading to exactly where we are: globalized free-market corporate  monopoly capitalism. This is done to depict our present circumstances not  as deliberately engineered, or contingent on any historical  circumstances, or political choices, but rather as something “natural”  and just an expression of unchanging human nature. With this retconning,  we are unable to think of different ways of organizing things, because  those ways—even in the very recent past—have been retconed out of  history. Even things in recent living memory—such as not going into debt  for an education, or being able to afford a single family house on 25  percent of your income—are retconned to make it so that they never  happened.  
&gt;  
&gt;*2. The individual has always been the basic unit of social  organization. People have always thought of themselves primarily as  citizens of territorial nation-states (British, German, French,  Canadian, etc.) with well-defined borders. The* [*neolocal*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolocal_residence) *monogamous nuclear family is the only natural and logical form of human social organization.*  
&gt;  
&gt;None of these statements are true, of course. Such arrangements are  very contingent upon time and place and culture, and often very recent.  For most of human history, the nation-state did not exist. There is  nothing “natural” about it–it was created from above by oligarchic  elites, just like the One Big Market. They are artificial creations.  
&gt;  
&gt;And while families are, indeed, “natural,” the form they take varies  widely. Most families were extended, and consisted of many generations  living either on the same land or under the same roof, together with  agnatic relations. Who was or was not considered a part of the family  had to do with kinship structures, typically encoded into the language  and culture.  
&gt;  
&gt;Extended kinship networks were the primordial form of human social  organization (as Lewis Henry Moran discovered). Religion, too, played a  significant role, especially ancestor worship, collective rituals, and  food-sharing meals and feasts ([even bonobos do it](https://www.sapiens.org/evolution/bonobos-meal-sharing/)).  
&gt;  
&gt;This was the conclusion made by Henry Sumner Maine by studying  ancient legal structures and comparing to them to surviving village  communities in India, Java, North America, and elsewhere. He writes, *“We  have the strongest reason for thinking that property once belonged not  to individuals nor even to isolated families, but to larger societies  composed on the patriarchal model.”* Concerning private property, he concludes,  
&gt;  
&gt;“…\[P\]rivate property, in the shape in which we know it,  was chiefly formed by the gradual disentanglement of the separate rights  of individuals from the blended rights of a community. Our  studies…seemed to show us the Family expanding into the Agnatic group of  kinsmen, then the Agnatic group dissolving into separate households;  lastly the household supplanted by the individual; and it is now  suggested that each step in the change corresponds to an analogous  alteration in the nature of Ownership.”“…if it be true that far the most important passage in the history of  Private Property is its gradual elimination from the co-ownership of  kinsmen, then the great point of inquiry…what were the motives which  originally prompted men to hold together in the family union? To such a  question, Jurisprudence, unassisted by other sciences, is not competent  to give a reply. The fact can only be noted.” (p. 159)  
&gt;  
&gt;This is why Marxists argued that “primitive communism” was the  original form of property ownership, i.e. socialism. Historically, this  is correct. The problem was that this was predicated upon extended  kinship networks and not large, industrial, nation states, composed of  strangers. That is, *primitive communism does not scale*, which is why market economies came to supplant them over time.  
&gt;  
&gt;Regarding the “lone individual” posited by Classical Liberals as the  primordial atomic unit of society, this, too, is ahistorical. Like the  primitive barter economy, anthropology has failed to turn it up anywhere  it has looked for it:  
&gt;  
&gt;It is here that archaic law renders us one of the  greatest of its services, and fills up a gap which otherwise could have  only been bridged by conjecture. It is full, in all its provinces, of  the clearest indications that society in primitive times was not what it  is assumed to be at present, a collection of \*individuals\*. In fact,  and in the view of the men who composed it, it was an \*aggregation of  families\*. **The contrast may be most forcibly expressed by saying  that the \*unit\* of an ancient society was the Family, or a modern  society the individual.** We must be prepared to find in ancient law all the consequences of this difference.\[Archaic Law\] is so framed as to be adjusted to a system of small  independent corporations. It is therefore scanty, because it is  supplemented by the despotic commands of the heads of households. It is  ceremonious, because the transactions to which it pays regard resemble  international concerns much more than the quick play of intercourse  between individuals.**Above all…it takes a view of \*life\* wholly unlike any which appears in developed jurisprudence.**  Corporations never die, and accordingly primitive law considers the  entities with which it deals, i.e. the patriarchal or family groups, as  perpetual and inditinguishable…Ancient Law pp. 134-135  
&gt;  
&gt;Surveying continental Europe and much of the colonial world, French scholar Emile de Lavaleye came to the same conclusion:  
&gt;  
&gt;Originally the clan, or village, is the collective body  owning the soil ; later on, it is the family, which has all the  characteristics of a perpetual corporation. The father of the family is  merely the administrator of the patrimony: when he dies, he is replaced  by another administrator. There is no place for the testament, nor even  for individual succession…Such was also the law everywhere where these  communities have existed; and, probably, every nation has passed through  the system.  
&gt;  
&gt;The point of all this, of course, is not to advocate a rewind to the  past. Rather, it is to show us that social forms change over time; and  what may adaptive in one context (say, [Fordism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Fordism)), will not work in another (say, an information economy). Lavaleye points this out himself:  
&gt;  
&gt;“…the object of this book is not to advocate a return to  the primitive agrarian community; but to establish historically the  natural right of property as proclaimed by philosophers, as well as to  show that ownership has assumed very various forms, and is consequently  susceptible of progressive reform.”

Your parents and many others might be social ladder climbers, one could argue all generations do this, however that doesn’t mean that they believe in destroying the environment to do it. There are man social structures and ladders to climb.

To your first points. The current generation has been in an era of war, but not conscription. So unless like me you were a volunteer- or a family member, war was something distant and different. The previous 3 generations lived through wars where the draft was normal. Roughly 5600 died in Iraq and Afghanistan. The odds of knowing even one for an average American are quite low. I worked in the Wounded Warrior facility, I lost 3 friends on 9/11, my views and that of a person that was in school are very different.

But let’s not discount the impact war has on society. It changes us for sure. But my point in my long stated above is basically that life sucks. We however get to choose to sit back and bitch about it or to go and make it different. It was meant not to demean but to inspire - I used sarcasm to show the dichotomy between generations and maybe that is lost, but the point is the same. Life. Is. Hard.

That depends. While racism in Russia certainly works a bit differently then in America, and even if you are ""white"", you will be regarded as foreigner....

Since most of the white nationalist ideology has similar roots and similar ideologues that have been influencing each other ofr cneturies, Russian white nationalists share similar beliefs to Western white nationalists, more often then not

For example, a white American will have a lot easier time then black American, because white privilige is definately a thing in Eastern Europe.

In cazul budistilor, nu se aplica in totalitate contra-argumentele, doar o parte.

&gt;Ce parere ai despre faptul ca religia isi  schimba anumite reguli pe masura ce evoluam ca societate? De exemplu  actualul papa promoveaza o atitudine diferita fata de ce era in trecut  in privinta persoanelor gay, divort, avort, celibatul preotilor, etc.?  Nu e asta un semn ca etica si filosofia morala influenteaza religia si  nu invers?

Adaptarea o consider un must-have si cred ca trebuie chiar sa fie asa. Religia o consider ca un indrumator, nu ca un ghid complet asupra felului de a trai. Religia, in modul cum as dori sa fie de fapt, ar trebui sa sustina libertatea fiecarui individ in parte. Inainte, persoanele de culoare au fost date de cel de sus drept slujitori ai celor alesi. Dupa un timp s-a modificat. Persoanele LGBTQ+ erau destinate iadului, acum se modifica treaba, si ei sunt oameni si tot asa. Eu vad religia ca si un indrumator spre o viata morala care sa fie buna si acum si pe viitor iar asta fara adaptarea asupra mediului social si etic este imposibila.

&gt;Doar in cateva situatii, prin spovedanie.  Dar daca esti din categoria LGBT, membru al unei alte religii, faci  avort, divortezi, etc. atunci nu prea.

Asta este doar in cazul crestinismului/musulmanilor in principal. Budistii nu au o viziune asupra avortului, persoanelor LGBTQ+, divort. La iudaism este acceptat avortul/divortul in situatiile in care se considera ca este in folosul familiei/persoanelor. 

&gt;Eu percep religia mai degraba ca un factor  ce dezbina la nivel global. Si fiecare religie uneste membrii impotriva   membrilor altor religii, care sunt identificati ca ""dusman"" comun. La  ce scop comun te referi?

Acceptarea comuna. Viziunea mea asupra religiei este una idealista, nu una realista din pacate. Este adevarat, dar cu timpul religiile se pot uni pentru un scop comun. Din ce am observat (fara multa cercetare, din pacate, ca na, nu ma intereseaza asa mult religiile moderne acum), romano-catolicii incearca aceasta unire.

&gt;Presupun ca te referi la nunta si botez.  Partea religioasa ""pentru ca asa se face"" si o sa te critice rudele daca  nu le faci. Momentele astea s-au sarbatorit si se vor sarbatori  intotdeauna, cu sau fara nevoia de factorul religios.

Ma refer si la craciun, paste in principal, nu la petrecerile de nunta/botez. Nici eu nu le suport astea, nici nu ma gandesc sa le fac vreodata. Am copilarit intr-o familie mai plina de certuri si de probleme iar craciunul/pastele erau printre singurele momente cand chiar eram uniti si incercau toti sa fie buni fata de restul. Legat de sarbatorirea ocaziilor mentionate si ale altora, da, nu consider o necesitate.

&gt;Desi raportat la cati bani gestioneaza si cat ajuta, as zice ca ONG'urile ajuta mai mult.

True, si mare dreptate. Dar orice ajutor conteaza. Totodata, sunt biserici la care preotii trimit 80% din bani catre orfelinate si azile de batrani, un preot dintr-un sat din apropiere a cumparat un microbuz pentru ca copii din sat sa poata merge la scoala iar exemplele pot continua.

E adevarat ca s-ar putea mai bine, ca astea sunt o exceptie de la majoritatea care exista, mai ales in tara noastra, dar cand nici macar un ONG nu vine de ani buni, asta poate ajuta mai mult decat iti imaginezi.

Another antipsychotic, Geodon, was side effect friendly, but couldn't 100% cut the mustard at controlling my mania, and after 5 years it started giving me akathisia. 

The two Seroquels are the only antipsychotics that I have tried that gave me neither EPS or hyperprolactinemia. It, unlike a few antipsychotics I tried, can control/ease/prevent all of my bipolar symptoms fully under usual circumstances. It is also helpful for curbing my anxiety.

The two Seroquels have been both sedating and weight unfriendly in the past, but not as weight unfriendly as some other antipsychotics I've tried. Seroquel XR can be weight neutral for me at doses of 450 mg and below. Above that is a bit of a challenge, but my weight gain has not been extreme. Last spring and summer, I managed to lose 10 lbs while at 500 and 600 mg between April and the end of July (with a two-week European vacation in between), but have since regained the loss, plus four pounds because of the holidays, etc.

I found sedation harder on regular Seroquel than Seroquel XR mostly because I usually took regular Seroquel in the morning as well as at night.

These new pushes are to remove all limits including those that prevent a doctor from going through with an abortion if the baby is delivered.  

The United States has legal abortion.  There is already a common ground.  The ""women's rights"" claims are not to ensure the middle ground but to permit everything including infanticide.  As you can see in the videos, they don't hide this.

The game autosaves frequently, but you can also save manually in the menu.  Press + to open inventory, then press R to switch to system menu.  

Basic gameplay is walk around and kill stuff.  Complete shrines to increase your hearts and stamina, and complete divine beast quests to make the final boss weaker (you can go fight the final boss at any point).

You're right about gangrene not requiring an infection, but there's still a very plain association between the two, particularly in wet gangrene involving injuries. The Celsus model of understanding it would be open wounds &gt; exposure to water contaminated by other humans or sewage &gt; infection spreads within the wound.

Big business wasn't to blame, David Cameron was, he tried to solidify the power of the conservative government and silence his right wing by winning the vote, he really messed up!

 **""It should have been easy from the start. Leave, and work a plan for that scenario, instead of begging the EU oligarchs to give you an easy way out.""** \- That's just bad planning. We cant negotiate the trade deal with the EU until after we leave, as that would effectively be the EU negotiating with the EU. In the mean time why damage the potential GDP's or forecast growth of the countries you wish to trade with. We also have a massive trade deficit and 70% (circa) of our trade with the EU comes through the ports, you need something for that to keep going. Then there is people.

**"" I'd argue the single biggest reason why Britain should want to leave, is in order to leave the single market. Yet, for some reason, it's what paralament is trying to protect the most.

Once we leave we loose those trade deals and have to start again as a solo state trading in mostly services. No wonder parliament is trying to protect it. It will take circa 2 years to get a trade deal with the EU let alone the other countries, none of which have yet signed up. The US is sniffing around and the next thing we know, TTIP. Then there is standards etc.

EndTorture,1485260262.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_14qfjr,False,"&gt; unstable

When you use the personal attack ""unstable"" *YSK this is often used against TTI victims.*

- YSK calling someone ""unstable"" is also not an excuse to attack them or assume guilt about them.

- YSK (just like with the private TTI) the accused may be claiming they were innocent of the allegations.

  (ie, never were ""unstable."")


&gt; The only time schizophrenics are actually hospitalized in the US, is if they either have committed a violent crime, or if they are having an acute psychotic episode or have attempted suicide.

That's assuming guilt.  Really, just like the private TTI industry an abusive family member could just lie, so a parent can accuse a kid of a crime and without any actual evidence/conviction of the crime (and no real trial, eg with a defense attorney and conviction) the person can be locked up.


&gt; receive therapy while inpatient. 

The type of therapy in the USA is not the legitimate type I mentioned in Europe which leads to recovery.

*It's more like management of the drugs with the goal of keeping the person on the drugs as much as possible.*

Anyways, in the early 1990s psychiatrists still considered gays to be mentally ill, then trans people, and so on as morality changes.

We look back at that as totally wrong, and in not very long (as the USA slowly shifts towards the UK model of therapy) we will look back at the current system similarly in shock at how such a bad system could exist for so long.


&gt; and everybody who gets psychiatric drugs also gets therapy.

You're asserting without evidence, like they're facts, like I don't know lots of people who get psychiatric drugs and don't get therapy.


&gt; Literally nobody is just drugged until they're a vegetable and shoved into a room somewhere to be ignored; 

You're assuming this, but really practically all the long-term inmates (often innocent/unconvicted people) in these 'hospitals' are given a serious/scary sounding label and drugged for it.  To be clear, they are given ""major tranquilizers"" (aka ""anti psychotics"".)

They are (without any evidence/conviction) violently abducted, forcefully injected with tranquilizers, and locked up for as long as the psychiatrists want even if there is nothing but accusations made against them that never lead to conviction based on evidence.

Disease is the only thing directly affecting OP, if one exists. Her habits? Are these European romps weekly? Monthly? Yearly? Is she EVER going back to Europe again? We don't know. Likely not.

Personality? You hear one thing about someone's life and you can judge their personality from that? Or are you assuming a single lie damns someone forever? She's a liar for the rest of time now, right? How do you know if she was brought up conservative and just let everything go during this trip? It's not unheard of.

[Australian Federation of Aids organizations](http://www.afao.org.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/4528/BP0709_Circumcision.pdf) They state that circumcision has ""no role"" in the HIV epidemic.
The [German Association of Pediatricians](http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/10/10/14347482-german-cabinet-approves-controversial-circumcision-bill) called for a ban recently.

The [German Association of Child and Youth Doctors](http://www.kinderaerzte-im-netz.de/bvkj/kinpopup/psfile/pdf/70/121126_Ste50aa5e211e6a6.pdf) recently Attacked the AAP's claims, saying the benefits they claim, including HIV reduction, are ""questionable,"" and that ""Seen from the outside, **cultural bias reflecting the normality of non-therapeutic male circumcision in the US seems obvious, and the report’s conclusions are different from those reached by doctors in other parts of the Western world,** including Europe, Canada, and Australia."" (scroll to page 7 for the English translation.)

The AAP was recently attacked by the [President of the British Association of Paediatric Urologists](http://www.nature.com/news/doctors-back-circumcision-1.11296) because the evidence of benefit is weak, and they are promoting **""Irreversible mutilating surgery.""**

[The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Saskatchewan](http://www.cmaj.ca/content/167/5/532.2.full) has taken a position against it, saying it is harmful and will likely be considered illegal in the future, given the number of men who are angry that it was done to them and are becoming activists against it. 

The President of the Saskatchewan Medical Association has said the same (link above).

The [Central Union for Child Welfare](http://www.childcentre.info/10595/) “considers that circumcision of boys that violates the personal integrity of the boys is not acceptable unless it is done for medical reasons to treat an illness. The basis for the measures of a society must be an unconditional respect for the bodily integrity of an under-aged person… **Circumcision can only be allowed to independent major persons, both women and men, after it has been ascertained that the person in question wants it of his or her own free will and he or she has not been subjected to pressure.**”

[Royal College of Surgeons of England]( http://www.rcseng.ac.uk/publications/docs/male_circumcision.html) 
&gt;""The one absolute indication for circumcision is scarring of the opening of the foreskin making it non- retractable (pathological phimosis). This is unusual before five years of age.""...""The parents and, when competent, the child, must be made fully aware of the implications of this
operation as it is a non-reversible procedure."" |

[British Medical Association]( http://bma.org.uk/-/media/Files/PDFs/Practical%20advice%20at%20work/Ethics/Circumcision.pdf)
&gt; **it is now widely accepted, including by the BMA, that this surgical procedure has medical and psychological risks.** .... **very similar arguments are also used to try and justify very harmful cultural procedures, such as female genital mutilation or ritual scarification.** Furthermore, **the harm of denying a person the opportunity to choose not to be circumcised must also be taken into account, together with the damage that can be done to the individual’s relationship with his parents and the medical profession if he feels harmed by the procedure.** .... parental preference alone is **not sufficient justification for performing a surgical procedure on a child.** .... The BMA considers that **the evidence concerning health benefit from non-therapeutic circumcision is insufficient for this alone to be a justification for doing it.** |

[Australian Medical Association](http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2/) Has a policy of discouraging it, ad says ""The Australian College of Paediatrics should **continue to discourage the practice of circumcision in newborns.**""

[Australian College of Paediatrics](http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/acp1996/): 
&gt;""The possibility that routine **circumcision may contravene human rights** has been raised because circumcision is performed on a minor and is **without proven medical benefit. Whether these legal concerns are valid will probably only be known if the matter is determined in a court of law** .....**Neonatal male circumcision has no medical indication.** It is a traumatic procedure performed without anaesthesia to **remove a normal and healthy prepuce.**""|

[Royal Australasian College of Physicians](http://www.racp.edu.au/index.cfm?objectid=65118B16-F145-8B74-236C86100E4E3E8E) 
&gt;Some men **strongly resent having been circumcised as infants. There has been increasing interest in this problem,** evidenced by the number of surgical and non-surgical techniques for recreation of the foreskin.|

ON that note, [74% of Australian doctors overall believe circumcision should not be offered, and 51% consider it abuse](http://www.australiandoctor.com.au/news/latest-news/strong-opposition-to-newborn-circumcision). Circumcision used to be common in Australia, but the movement against it spread faster there than America, where rates continue to drop.

A letter by the [South African Medical Association](http://www.icgi.org/Downloads/SAMA-NOCIRC-2011-06-25.pdf) said this:
&gt;The matter was discussed by the members of the Human Rights, Law &amp; Ethics Committee at their previous meeting and they agreed with the content of the letter by NOCIRC SA. The Committee stated that it was unethical and illegal to perform circumcision on infant boys in this instance. In particular, the Committee expressed serious concern that not enough scientifically-based evidence was available to confirm that circumcisions prevented HIV contraction and that the public at large was influenced by incorrect and misrepresented information. The Committee reiterated its view that it did not support circumcision to prevent HIV transmission.

This one is a detailed evaluation of the arguments in favor of circumcision, They note that during one of the recent trials in Africa, the researchers claimed there was no loss of sexual satisfaction, when in fact there was. But the RACS called them out: 
&gt;""**Despite uncircumcised men reporting greater sexual satisfaction, which was statistically significant,** Kigozi et al (2008) concluded that adult male circumcision does not adversely affect sexual satisfaction or clinically significant function in men."" In general, they discuss how there's no evidence to support it.

[The Norwegian Council of Medical Ethics](http://www.cirp.org/library/ethics/gulbrandsen1/) states that ritual circumcision of boys is not consistent with important principles of medical ethics, that it is without medical value, and should not be paid for with public funds.

The [Norwegian Children’s Ombudsman](http://www.crin.org/resources/infodetail.asp?id=25991) is opposed as well. 

The [Denmark National Council for Children is also opposed.](http://www.crin.org/violence/search/closeup.asp?infoID=19016)

And recently, the politically appointed Health minister of Norway opposed a ban on circumcision, yet [the ban was supported by the Norwegian Medical Association, the Norwegian Nurses Organization, the Norwegian Ombudsman for Children, and the University of Oslo.](http://www.thelocal.no/page/view/minister-says-no-to-circumcision-ban-)

Swedish Association for Sexuality Education published [this guide](http://www.rfsu.se/en/Engelska/About-rfsu/Resources/Publications/Dicktionary/) that talks about circumcision, in a pretty negative way. not an official advocacy policy but it makes it fairly clear. it also mentions the frenulum is sexually sensitive, and helps prevent infection by blocking fluid from the urethra; the frenulum is often removed in an infant circumcision, yet easier to leave intact if an adult is circumcised.

In ten chapters (covering Russia; China; the USA; Latin America; the Middle East; Africa; India and Pakistan; Europe; Japan and Korea; and the Arctic), using maps, essays and occasionally the personal experiences of the widely traveled author, Prisoners of Geography looks at the past, present and future to offer an essential insight into one of the major factors that determines world history.  


**Dream Cities: Seven Urban Ideas That Shape the World**\- Dream Cities explores our cities in a new way—as expressions of ideas, often conflicting, about how we should live, work, play, make, buy, and believe. It tells the stories of the real architects and thinkers whose imagined cities became the blueprints for the world we live in.

From the nineteenth century to today, what began as visionary concepts—sometimes utopian, sometimes outlandish, always controversial—were gradually adopted and constructed on a massive scale in cities around the world, from Dubai to Ulan Bator to London to Los Angeles. Wade Graham uses the lives of the pivotal dreamers behind these concepts, as well as their acolytes and antagonists, to deconstruct our urban landscapes—the houses, towers, civic centers, condominiums, shopping malls, boulevards, highways, and spaces in between—exposing the ideals and ideas embodied in each. Illustrated with 59 black-and-white photos throughout the text

**Beyond the Map: Unruly Enclaves, Ghostly Places, Emerging Lands and Our Search for New Utopias-** In Beyond the Map, Bonnett presents stories of the world’s most extraordinary spaces—many unmarked on any official map—all of which challenge our assumptions about what we know—or think we know—about our world. As cultural, religious, and political boundaries ebb and flow with each passing day and the messy maps of human and physical geography overwhelm us, traditional maps unravel and fragment. With the same adventurous spirit he effused in the acclaimed Unruly Places, Bonnett takes us to thirty-nine incredible places from around the globe that explore these changing boundaries and stimulate our geographical imagination. Some are tied to disruptive contemporary political turbulence, such as the rise of ISIL, Russia’s incursions into Ukraine, and the Brexit vote in the United Kingdom. Others explore the secret places not shown on Google Earth or reflect fast-changing landscapes. Natural processes such as hurricanes and rising sea levels continue to remake the world, as do human pollution and the relentless construction that destroys habitable land.

Beyond the Map journeys out into a world of mysterious, daunting, and magical spaces. It is a world of hidden cultures and ghostly memories; of uncountable new islands and curious stabs at paradise. From the phantom tunnels of the Tokyo subway to a stunning movie-set recreation of 1950s-era Moscow; from the caliphate of the Islamic State to virtual cybertopias—Beyond the Map serves as an imaginative guide to the farthest fringes of geography.

You can say a lot about socialism and it’s failures in the 20th century but that’s not one of them.

The reason why some communist countries had trouble with food are varied, some countries had famines before communism and had some after but generally the spread of communism improved people’s food intake drastically. Improving infrastructure and removing all of the famines that happened in China and Eastern Europe forever. 

With North Korea, it was a bit different. They really began to suffer when the ussr fell, for those that don’t know, the soviets and Chinese fell out so China went its own way, North Korea stayed very friendly with the ussr and received ample amounts of aid, so much so that like others have said, until the 80’s it was a better place to live than the south. When the ussr failed all that aid disappeared overnight, and so not even fiver years later, a country that was doing so well just a decade or two before found itself with an economic model that was based on aid and the only person that was giving it any had just left the show and so famine ensues.

montyprime,1537845697.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_2a7b4ye7,False,"&gt; but why would they be shipping so many cars to Europe and not doing any production for the US at all? 

Because they are going to delay US deliveries to make room for a initial burst of european and chinese deliveries.  Then presumably have a set production split between the markets which will change when the chinese factory opens.

As of now all that matters is that they are selling every car they make.  If customers are willing to wait for delivery, they can take advantage of that and ensure they sell 100% of their production.

Say they increase production to 10k a week for the model 3.  That would let them sell 5k in the US and 5k in china and europe.  But what if demand drops back down to 5k worldwide? 2019 is supposed to see a decrease in demand across the auto market.  They would have lost a ton of money expanding their production for a peak demand that wasn't sustainable.

If they keep production at 5k-6k and demand at those levels is sustainable, then they won't generate losses. The only downside is that customers will wait longer for delivery.

Tesla can survive having crappy service and longer delivery times as long as they are the only long range EV in town.  It is what it is and it would be silly not to take advantage of a market without competitors to protect yourself from losses. (argue all you want but none of the other EVs around $40k can charge fast enough to be considered long range and the US lacks a charging infrastructure for them).

&gt;means that unlimited demand is....very limited.

Unlimited demand is really just sustainable demand that you know you will get each week going forward with no stop date in sight.  They may have unlimited demand at 5k a week for the foreseeable future(many car companies enjoy this with even much higher weekly numbers).   That doesn't mean they can produce 10k a week, it means as long as they stick to 5k they won't have to halt production lines and lose money on investments in production.

We are just getting into a nuance about words even though it is clear what is going on.  I think musk just wants to indicate they have no reason to believe the 5k a week cannot be fully sold.

From what I understand (for if the player has not been signed to a contract). If the player is an international under contract overseas, the team retains the right for one year after that contract ends and if they're not under contract, the team retains their rights for one year and then the player will have to enter one more draft essentially wasting 2 years.

If the player is under contract, a standard contract agreed on in the CBA means players are supposed to demonstrate sportsmanship and not damage the image of the team (which refusing to play does). The contract will give the team the right to not pay him or sue him for breaching his contract. Injuries however, give the players the right to refuse if they are diagnosed by team doctors.

The young Maharaja Piyush was a kind and charitable man, and soon after his coronation he [converted from Hindu to the pacifist Jain faith](https://i.imgur.com/339Hbac.jpg). At the time, most of the nobility was Hindu but about half of the realm's subjects were Jain. Piyush's family and several of his vassals also converted at his request. Meanwhile, his Hindu vassal Rajas continued their wars of expansion and the [kingdom's borders reached the east coast of the subcontinent](https://i.imgur.com/3uUlYcD.jpg). 

As India's most eligible bachelor, Piyush had many potential brides to choose from. After a lengthy search, [he married the beautiful young princess Maya of the Licchavi Raj](https://i.imgur.com/o5NKWRQ.jpg) to the north. (Maya's in-game portrait is not that flattering but she has the ""attractive"" trait which makes her significantly more liked by men.) Piyush married for love; not only was Maya the fairest of them all, she also shared many of Piyush's virtues. He had little to gain from an alliance with the Licchavi Raj, and to the disapproval of his Hindu vassals, she was a member of the wrong caste. (In the game, Jains allow inter-caste marriages but Hindus don't; I assume this reflects religious values of the time.) Not wanting religious differences to pull apart the kingdom, Piyush set out to peacefully convert the rest of the nobility to Jainism by using diplomacy to persuade vassals with a favorable opinion of him, and sending priests to convert the rest.

In 800 AD, the [Viking age began in the game](https://i.imgur.com/zl31RAy.jpg), which modifies stats for Norse characters and begins a period of turmoil in western Europe. Maharaja Piyush's appropriately scripted response: ""I do not see how this concerns us."" lol

CarlTheFarmer,1528678191.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_dt3g98,False,"If you mean deeper meaning, then not always. But, they mostly aren't just ""normal names"" - they are almost always a reference to something, or something SIU came up with. I'll stick to the irregulars only, since listing everything is too much.

Confirmed is: ""Viole"" from ""violet"" - prolly because he is wearing violet when he is first introduced, ""Khun"", should be ""Kun"" and is from ""Sergio Kun Aguero"", a footballer. ""Urek"" is from the korean word for rockfish - because, acording to SIU, he's gray. ""Mazino"" is from the Maginot line.

Stuff that hasn't been stated but I'm confident in presuming(although I don't speak Korean - names can be easy to decipher):

""Arie"" should be ""Arieh"", which is a Hebrew name meaning lion, and Hon in Korean means spirit, ghost. So, literaly it's ""lion spirit"" - refering to the sword style. ""Ari Han"" is named in a way to express similarity to this(since they are related).

""Arlen"" is a name meaning oath, pledge - refering to the use of spells.

""Ha"" could be explained by [this](https://www.ancestry.com/name-origin?surname=ha), since the clan branches into two(assuming the info is trustworthy). Yurin means something like violate in Korean, which is due to her agressive nature.

""Gustang"" is from ""Ford Mustang"", because he is suposed to be the American idea of a gentleman, elegance, etc.

""Yeon"" means ""lotus flower""(among other things) in Korean, which could refer to the Zygaena emblem Ehwa always wears. Hana means something like elegant, graceful in Korean(or atleast is the root for words that do), which is due to her gentle personality.

""Eurasia"" is the landmass consisting of Europe and Asia(although the significance is unclear), and ""Blossom"" is probably reference to her liking to wear flamboyant clothes.

keystorm,1374477808.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_cgvdq,False,"&gt;	In 2017, following the referendum crisis of October, the Spanish government forced Catalonia into regional elections. The PDeCat ran a joint ticket with ERC - partly in fear of making their own weakness apparent - which thereafter only managed to make the ERC realise that their support of the CDC’s mishaps (in the form of running with Puigdemont for the presidency) has become more a liability than an advantage. Once again, the CUP refused to run along; which combined with their great growth in votes, has made regional parliamentary politics ever more chaotic and fruitless.

Nope. The joint ticket was Mas’ and Junqueras’ from 2015 called Junts pel Sí, only CUP refused to join; who utlimately forces the rwmocal of Mas and the inauguration of an unknown Carles Puigdemont. They succeeded and had a combined majority which allowed to organise the 2017 referendum, unopposed in parliament.

However, after the referendum and the detention of the soon to become political prisoners, ERC refused to run a joint ticket with PDeCat this time around; Junqueras being in prison and Puigdemont in exile. A whiff of treason reached the ERC lines (even though it is still unknown whether they all knew each other’s intentions) and they thought they could play the martyr card during campaing, while Puigdemont, from Belgium, still had to decide if he was going full on with PDeCat or he’d just try to cover the name under yet another coalition. He finally created a new umbrella called Junts per Catalunya and they finally beat ERC in the forced elections (forced by a more than dubious application if the constitution art. 155), achieving yet again a parliamentary majority in favour of independence.

The Junts x Catalunya ticket was formed by several members of a new generation of PDeCat, but also by the minority party Reagrupament and several other unaligned candidates. Oddly enough, Reagrupament is a small party that split from ERC several years ago. They were a harder branch seeking unilateral independence at any cost. Torra was a member of that party, before being sucked into JxCat. So Torra is neither a leader nor a member of PDeCat. He’s head of a government formed by a mixed cabinet of PDeCat and ERC, who are now competing against each other in European and municipal elections. smh

Puigdemont is still part of PDeCat, but has since refused to be a part of its leadership and instead runs rogue in Belgium. ERC refused to swear him in alleging presidents cannot be inaugurated unless defending their candidacy in the parliament, in person (ERC’s own candidate Companys was sworn in by telegram some 80 years ago, but that’s a story for another time).

It would seem however that, while “Crida Nacional per la República” a brand new party seeking to finally crystallise what JxCat intended to become (a brand that was stolen by PDeCat from under Puigdemont’s nose, but again that’s a story for another time), ERC has taken it upon itself to become the opportunistic pragmatical center-left party not too much inspired by independence. Flirting with Podemos and Comuns, left parties. Both are unaligned in regards of independence, but are timidly for an official referendum they know is indefensible in Madrid.

PDeCat has no other choice but to be completely absorbed by Crida. They might not survive the blow if they don’t follow president Puigdemont, blindly. This doesn’t mean Crida is neceassarily liberal center-right, but with the radical opposition of ERC (which is strategical rather than political) the leftist forces inside Crida are rather weak. Their manifesto is mainly realpolitik in pursuit of independence, though.

Some say ERC has abandoned its pursuit for the Catalan independence, some other think they just want to broaden its supports while trying to allure less invested independentists or turning to  those supporting Catalan’s right to self-determination, but less clearly about independence. Some even say they are just playing the sheep and try to win over more votes from the loyalist side by moderating their speech.

Then there’s Primàries, a new party lead by the non-partisan, former philosophy professor at Princeton Jordi Graupera. It’s a party that roots in radical democratic participation. The ticket is decided by a series of voting, and anyone can join. The prospects are unclear, but they seek to declare unilateral independence and are campaigning fiercely against both ERC and PDeCat/Crida (smh...). They only run in the bigger cities, and don’t run for the European elections at all.

All in all, pro-independence politics has become more sparse and atomised: 

-	Many leftists and rightists still stand behind Puigdemont, after all it was he who took it upon himself to organise and take the full responsibility for the referendum. Never in recent history had Catalonia been so close to independence. hia determination back then seems a proof of further action.
-	Many support how Junqueras will represent them in an ultimate trial to prove that Spain is not a state of right, but an autoritarian, repressive and undemocratic state. Many ”new” independentists (after the police brutality in 2017) feel confortable with this approach. He is a simple, generous, peaceful and traditional man who embodies the concept of innocence. Him being jailed is just a time bomb for Spain.
-	Many feel betrayed by both of them because they consider the referendum was won and the leaders did not apply the results as they should. They are instead just playing power games instead of doing realpolitik in favour of independence. They see in Graupera and his new vision a breath of air and a new bet for courage to finally break free from Spain, whatever the cost at this point.",True,False,False,,0,1549062294,,1549066438,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",efk0aoj,False,t3_alq6c0,True,t1_efgg2ii,/r/catalunya/comments/alq6c0/questions_about_catalan_political_parties/efk0aoj/,False,,1553410174,3,True,False,catalunya,t5_2s049,r/catalunya,public,,

HaricotsDeLiam,1518656498.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_x3bc9ln,False,"&gt;Why is this,

Wiktionary shows *light* as in ""bright"" as coming from a different PIE root than *light* as in ""lightweight"". The former comes from [PIE \*lewk-](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/lewk-) meaning ""bright"" or ""to shine"", and from this we get a ton of other cognate nouns and adjectives such as Latin *lux* ""light"", German *licht* ""light"", Russian луч *luč* ""ray"", and Greek λευκός *leukós* ""white \[figuratively\], blank, clean"" (can also mean ""white person""). Meanwhile, the latter comes from [PIE \*h₁lengʷʰ-](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/h%E2%82%81leng%CA%B7%CA%B0-), and from this we get cognates like German *leicht* ""light, easy, low-calorie, slight""; Albanian *lehtë* (similar to German); and Sanskrit लघु *laghú* ""light, nimble, easy, healthy, short, young, clean, soft, \[etc.\]"".

&gt;and does the relationship hold in other languages?

Some but not all. Here are some languages (both IE and non-IE) where the terms differ

&gt; # [Presidente de Colombia prevé caída de la ""dictadura"" venezolana en pocas horas](https://www.americaeconomia.com/politica-sociedad/politica/380)
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt; **Bogotá**. A la dictadura de Venezuela le quedan pocas horas, dijo este viernes el presidente de Colombia, Iván Duque, quien pidió estrechar el cerco diplomático contra Nicolás Maduro para facilitar el regreso de la democracia al país petrolero.
&gt; 
&gt; Colombia, que es parte del Grupo de Lima, reconoció al líder opositor Juan Guaidó como presidente interino de Venezuela.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Hoy es digno de aplaudir lo que está viendo el mundo y es que a la dictadura de Venezuela le quedan muy pocas horas, porque hay un nuevo régimen institucional que se está creando gracias al trabajo que ha jugado Colombia y otros países"", sostuvo Duque en un acto de gobierno, en el departamento del Huila, al suroeste del país.
&gt; 
&gt; Si bien Guaidó tiene el respaldo de Estados Unidos y los gobiernos de la Unión Europea probablemente lo reconocerán, Maduro sigue aferrado al poder con el respaldo de la cúpula militar, además de Rusia y China, en medio de la agudización de la lucha por el poder en el país petrolero.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Yo espero que en los próximos días el cerco diplomático continué"", dijo Duque, al insistir en unas elecciones libres en Venezuela como parte de un proceso de transición para recuperar la democracia.
&gt; 
&gt; Colombia se ha convertido en el principal destino de más de un tercio de los tres millones de venezolanos que abandonaron su país huyendo de la crisis.

Claiming that anyone is against essential resources being stripped from our country for next to no value because of xenophobia or emotional responses is ludicrous.

It's very simple to explain: we live in NZ, not any other country. We need certain resources to survive. If another country takes our resources then our survival is threatened. 


Historically, this is very similar to the Europeans coming into NZ. They paid off a very small group of native people so they could appropriate vital resources (land). Fast forward 150 years or so and the native people sit at the bottom of most statistics. 

Similarly, people have clearly either been paid off, or influenced to bring about the current legislative mire we have found ourselves in.

[deleted],,,,,,,dark,,,,"&gt; It's less than perfect here in the UK but everyone is going in the same direction

How is the US going in that direction?

&gt;You have a right to self defence here but the right to bear arms isn't a right in almost anywhere except the US and funnily enough there is pretty much zero requirement to be armed for self defence here. 

Rights are not granted by government. You inherently have them as a human. So yes, the UK *does* have the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, but your government fails to respect it.

As for self defense specifically, it is far more restricted in the UK. For example, what you are allowed to do when a burglar enters your home.

&gt;What taxes are obscenely high? I pay 31% on my income and that includes a hell of a lot more for my money than the US will. 

Personal income and VAT/sales taxes, for starters. Highest income tax bracket in the UK is 45% (46% in Scotland), highest (federal) tax bracket in the US is 37%. VAT for most goods in the UK is 20%, sales taxes in the US vary by state from a max of 7.25% in California to 0% in others.

&gt;Certain parts are but the majority of the country isn't.

Where is it not?

&gt;Can you elaborate on this?

Much of the UK lacks things which (should be) considered basic necessities in a first world country. Like air conditioning. [Hopefully](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_European_heat_wave) that never bites you in the [ass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_European_heat_wave).

&gt;America also has a rigid class system, you may be blind to it but it's true. Social mobility is greater in the UK than in the US

[Nope.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/The_Great_Gatsby_Curve.png)

We also (for the most part) do not force people to wear a uniform for the first 18 years of their life. I guess we are just not as obsessed with comparing classes.

&gt;Don't disagree but don't see how that corresponds to 3rd world countries.

I didn't say it did, but you asked what makes the UK so bad.

&gt;Don't really get this as a reason to not live here. The US isn't particularly great at this either

Because I don't like being around people who are apologetic about crimes against humanity. I have a friend from India, and there's a reason he doesn't have much nice to say about your country.

 In what way is the US bad about this?

Fresherty,1350751605.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_9d138,False,"&gt; How often is it that you can't predict when and where you will need something? 

Personally I can't. I'm MD and, among other things, part of my job are home visits which sometimes come at moments notice. That means I have basic kit of ""stuff"" including laptop and mobile printer in a trunk of a car. With tradesmen I'd imagine similar principle applies, although more along the line of them needing tools in place A and going with said tools to place B where those are needed without delay.

&gt;I'm assuming the courier car services would not need standard cars, but be vehicles built for this type of purpose. Yes, you'd need to make sure you get the right size storage.

That's kinda the point I'm making with issues of delay. Courier services (could) work efficiently because they drop off ""stuff"" along the pre-planned route. If I'm at place H (home) and need the same box at places A, B and C in relatively rapid succession it's going to be a problem. If on top of that I can't really realibly predict exact times I'll need it at A, B and C so the worse. It would mean there has to be pool of ready-to-go carriers pre-positioned around the city. What's even worse is quite often the times I need stuff moved might be exactly the same time some other people want their stuff moved (which I'll get back to a bit later).

&gt;With that said, I think you're heavily underestimating the influence of big city and non-American lifestyles.

I live in big city (well, in TOP50 by population) in Europe, and quite honestly looking from my own POV, as well as people I know and interact with (which come from ALL kind of backgrounds mind you) I still don't see it happening.

&gt;It's already cost-prohibitive in many big cities if you are being frugal.

Really depends on a city, your use and how you value your time... Big part of why it's cost-prohibitive is because of subsidies. Vast majority of public transit systems are ran at significant loss, and money to cover it comes from - you guessed it - car owners via taxation and things like parking rates. The less cars there are, the more expensive public transport will be and at some point you'll run into the issue of costs... and you can't increase cost of public transport because that in turn would reduce mobility those on bottom of wealth scale, which in turn will completely mess up basically everything... and we'll run into topic of taxation etc., and that's massive discussion in itself.

&gt; These types of services - if they can be more cost effective than public transportation - will flourish there.

As supplement to existing public transport network, sure. As replacement? Not really. There are several fundamental issues here that really need to be covered. First, people who use cars here generally speaking need them for good reason. Some of those reasons will be covered within the 'car as a service' system, sure, but quite a few will not. Second, car as a service will really not be that much more efficient. That's what I mentioned again - people generally speaking want to move stuff and themselves around at specific times. That's why you have rush hours in the morning and afternoon. Replacing that with a service will decrease number of cars (assuming we keep buses), but it will not be dramatic decrease simply because amount of people 1 car can serve to get from ""we work here"" area to ""I live here"" area will not be significantly higher than 1. Depending on exact layout of a city and general habits that can obviously change a bit, but for most time you'll end up with massive amount of cars being parked somewhere anyways, just like you do today, and in the end of such ""total replacement"" service might end up being so close to owning a car that with additional issues it brings it turns out to be unpractical.

&gt;I'm talking about how many European and Asian countries are comparatively smaller, and many people go without cars anyway. 

The thing about European-style cities is I really don't need a car for anything else other than going to various workplaces, and that applies to most people. Everything I need daily is within at worst 100 meters from my apartment and that again applies to every semi-urban area here. Groceries? Multiple supermarkets and small convienience stores. Fitness? There are two fitness centers I literally see from my windows I can go to, and probably more within the distance I mentioned. There's swimming pool next to school again around 100 meters from where I live. There's bunch of specialist stores around as well, variety of affordable restaurants etc. Only reason for me to actually go to city center other than work is to meet someone in a pub, go to a theater or for fine dining etc.

To put it simply the trick is not to add a service that makes people go around, it's to stop people from going around in first place. That's why I think the future is telecommuting for those that can do it, focusing on delivery services and other ways to keep people in homes.

&gt;Yes, but these are details that can and will be worked out.

That's lovely stance but again, how would you want to solve the issue of ""we have 1 million people that we need to move around at EXACTLY SAME TIME"" without violating fundamental freedoms and literally forcing them to stagger travel times? That's basically what we're trying to do for what, 70 years now? And yet we still have rush hours, we still have traffic jams and so on.

&gt;Once you're an established company in the big city you pay analysts to figure out the questions you are asking using the data you've already collected on a big city.

Again lovely idea... Except data you get from City A will not apply to City B 100 km away that's the same size, except different culturaly. It will surely not apply to smaller city because oh surprise people's daily routine you need to work around (or attempt to influence) is completely different. Issue here is something so fundamental as mobility is really REALLY hard nut to crack for many reasons, and people are and will be resistant to the very concept. I mean, hell, thing like Uber is functionally a taxi in a way you interact with it and yet there's massive resistance to the very notion here.

&gt;Which is why the service will come to where it is dense enough to support it and won't move until it is not.

IMHO it simply will not move out at all... and you can expect a lot of self-driving cars being devastated ""in protest"" by taxi drivers.

&gt;Cars by definition are mobile, it'll be very hard for a single company to ""own"" a town

Lets say you have a town A. To properly service the town using self-driving cars you need infrastructure: automated charging stations (or manual ones + labour cost, I'm assuming we're going electric here), vehicle maintenece facilities, vehicle storage facilities and some initial pool of vehicles to start working service with. For the sake of discussion lets assume you don't need to park your vehicles during operation, you just keep driving in circles, so there's no need for anything like taxi stops. What happens? Well first of all you get massive resistance from taxi drivers, so you'll need to somehow make your service better... and realistically only thing you can compete with is cost, assuming you maintain same availability of a service, responsiveness etc. which means you really can't start with 5 cars, you need much more (depending on size of a population). Alternatively you can be a taxi company itself and try to wiggle your way via replacing the inventory successively. Lets assume you successfully do that, now you have a service that works in a city and you removed taxis. Now you need to lower your costs to start expanding and compete with normal cars, so you expand your system, introduce more cars etc. and successfully start your regular service, everyone is happy!

Except you're company A in town A. What's the issue here? Well, the issue here is there's absolutely no incentive for company B to also enter town A at the same time. Barrier of entry is too high, and realistically nobody will gain from that. What will happen is company B will enter town B. Basically what you'll end up with is a system similar to how USA cable TV market works... except the ""internet"" provided by company A is not compatible with internet from company ""B"", so idea of getting automated car and going from town A to B will be impossible, because company A will not have practical access to town B, and company B to town A... unless you force some standards and allow interchangability of vehicles between those companies. Or even better, create a monopoly. First option will require government intervention, and that realistically will force subsidies... and that's quite honestly best option. Second option is terrifying because the monopoly means we'll be absolutely shafted with pricing, and you'll put something as essential as transport in hands of private monopoly. And no, that's not something we already have - mega-corporation of today provide some relatively important services, but something like transportation is critical. Think ""it stops working for a couple days and society collapses"" critical. 

Alternative option is government monopoly, and quite honestly I can see that happening as extension of already existing public transport networks here.

Oh, and the thing I mentioned before - pricing. R&amp;D and adoption costs are massive issue. All companies that dabble in automation are well north of $1 bn. in red so far, and that's just making the damn thing work on small scale. That number will increase exponentially from now on because vehicles themselves will be expensive and very likely to be initially unreliable, local infrastructure needs to be built, and as I mentioned before you need to compete on price in already very competitive market. All those costs will be eventually moved on people using the system, and there's only so much money investors will want to pump until they want to see some return.",True,False,False,,0,1549067223,,1549067710,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",efk67bn,False,t3_am2056,True,t1_efk17n9,/r/science/comments/am2056/selfdriving_cars_will_cruise_to_avoid_paying_to/efk67bn/,False,,1553412920,1,True,False,science,t5_mouw,r/science,public,,

europeanhousesparrow,1536356388.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_25uade7e,False,"(Long) Story time! Technically this is neither a disappointment nor a success for me, but it's been such a ride that I just have to share.  
Sometime in early December, I applied to a public sector position in a company owned by the provincial government. It was the usual ""upload your resume, then type it out again three times"" platform deal. There was an area for expected salary, which was annoyingly required. Usually, I'll leave it empty if I'm able; if it validates for any type of content, I'm a fan of ""TBD"". Unfortunately, it was unexpectedly efficient and wanted a number. 

HERE'S WHERE I FUCKED UP. I put in a number that I figured was low enough not to get the application tossed out immediately, but close enough to the general range of my current salary that we could bang it out later in a screening call. Oddly, salary was not disclosed in the job description, which is usually required for a government position, as I understand it.

I heard nothing in the following weeks so I figured RIP and moved on.

Early in January, on the Friday before I was set to return to work after a two-week holiday, I get a call from an unknown number. I ignore it and let it go to voicemail, because of who I am as a person. Turns out it's the government company, and can I come in first thing Monday morning for an interview? 

I decide I'll respond over the weekend as I was busy doing other things. Then I get an email from the same HR rep, letting me know that my interview was at 11am on Monday. Wow, OK. Then she calls AGAIN. This is all in the span of two hours. 

Over the weekend I shoot her an email to let her know that while it probably wouldn't be appropriate for me to ditch work the morning of my first day back for an interview (worded it a little differently, obviously), I'd be eager to come in later in the week if they can accommodate. 

I hear back and we set something up for Wednesday. Keep in mind that I have not had so much as a phone screen yet; this will become important. But I figure, government agency, probably a little old-fashioned.

I go in for the interview. The building is old and decrepit; the unionized receptionist is super salty. I too, am salty. The woman from HR is late; something something subway trouble.

Anyway, I go in for this interview. It's a panel interview with three individuals, one of whom being the hiring manager. Somehow, I hit it out of the park. The role does sound pretty interesting. Hiring manager and I seem to have a good rapport. 

Afterwards, HR woman leads me back out of the secure area and into the lobby to wait for an elevator back down to the ground floor and exit. I press the button. I wait for about five minutes. There is no elevator. I see a sign that says ""Elevator maintenance on \[date\]."" The date is not today, but this is the government. The elevators are not working, and there are no stairs. I cannot get back into the offices as they're passcard-protected. I am trapped in the lobby.

But wait! Here is the hiring manager from the interview! Thank God! He opens the door and pokes his head into the lobby. ""Hello!"" I say. ""The elevators are not working and I am stuck in the lobby!""

""Ha ha!"" he replies jovially. ""Oh no, I am late for a meeting with my boss!"" And he closes the door and walks down the hallway, out of sight.

After about another five minutes, I email the HR rep about my predicament. Thankfully, she comes and scans me in so that I can take a nearby stairwell and make my escape.

But wait! It gets better!

About a week later, I get an email from the HR rep saying they'd like to move to the ""next step"", which is, apparently, a background and reference check. It seems highly unusual that they would spend money on such a thing before an offer is even mentioned, but whatever, I have nothing to hide. I give them the details they need and figure it will be at least a couple of weeks before I hear anything else, since background checks can take a while.

But no! After less than a week, the hiring manager calls and is happy to tell me that I have the position! Only now are all details revealed, including a salary that's $15k lower than my current, along with a mandatory pension that will siphon off an additional 10%. Plus! This offer is at the END of the salary range, which means there is NO room for annual raises unless I apply for and receive a higher internal position. Exciting!

Anyway, I keep it positive and tell him that it's very exciting news; I have a few concerns about the salary, but I'll reach out to the HR rep about it when she emails me the offer.

Only I do not get an offer. I get an email with the subject line ""WELCOME TO \[GOVERNMENT AGENCY\]"". There is no offer letter inside, nothing to sign, no mention even of salary enclosed. Just a bunch of brochures about the pension and health benefits along with the code of conduct and instructions to swing by with my passport and a blank cheque within two weeks.

This is fun. I sit on it for a day, then email back a counter-offer, hoping to clear things up: ""Dear XXX, thank you very much for this OFFER, I am very excited to CONSIDER this OFFER...""

Now, admittedly, the counter-offer was quite aggressive. The tone was professional enough, but I asked for the world, and keep in mind that at this point, I was 100% ready to walk away. I had already 99.9% decided that this wasn't going to be the role for me. My current workplace is toxic as hell, but it was really fun for the first few years until new management came in, and so I am willing to stick it out for long enough to find the RIGHT job. I am not willing to apply a bandaid solution only to be miserable and looking again in six months.

A day goes by with no answer to my counter-offer. A few more. Okay, I think, maybe they are looking into whether what I asked for is possible. I don't think they can do it, but it takes time to go through the motions.

A week ticks by. I figure, it's definitely rescinded—I'm comfortable with that—and they're using the rare and exotic Ghost Method to do it. Well, one less uncomfortable conversation for me.

But then! Today! A week and a half after I sent the counter-offer, I receive an email from an HR rep I haven't spoken with before that basically says:

""Dear europeanhousesparrow, we are not able to amend the original offer, which expired on January 30th. We wish you the best of luck in your search.""

I'm sure it doesn't bear mentioning that there was no ""expiry"" date anywhere in the package they sent me, but that's neither here nor there.  
So that's a new one for the books! A twist on the Ghost Rescind: Make Up An Expiry Date And Then Wait Until After It.  
My only regret is that they obviously didn't keep a backup candidate—it would have been nice for some good to have come of this for someone else. But I don't regret my decision, because I know there's something better waiting for me, and hopefully their elevators work.",True,False,False,,0,1549068646,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",efk7usn,False,t3_akmfy6,True,t3_akmfy6,/r/jobs/comments/akmfy6/success_and_disappointment_megathread_for_the/efk7usn/,False,,1553413683,1,True,False,jobs,t5_2qhnd,r/jobs,public,,

Parliamentary elections were held in Venezuela on 6 December 2015 to elect the 164 deputies and three indigenous representatives of the National Assembly. They were the fourth parliamentary elections to take place after the 1999 constitution, which abolished the bicameral system in favour of a unicameral parliament, and the first to take place after the death of President Hugo Chávez. Despite claims from the opposition of a possible last-minute cancellation, the elections took place as scheduled, with the majority of polls showing the Democratic Unity Roundtable (MUD) holding a wide lead over the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) and its wider alliance, the Great Patriotic Pole (GPP).

The political landscape leading up to the elections was heavily influenced by the severe economic crisis faced by the country, as well as a series of protests that took place in 2014, after which former Chacao mayor and leader of Popular Will, Leopoldo López, was detained and sentenced to 14 years in prison.

**2013 Venezuelan presidential election**

Presidential elections were held in Venezuela on 14 April 2013 following the death of President Hugo Chávez on 5 March 2013. Voters gave Nicolás Maduro—who had assumed the role of acting president since Chávez's death—a narrow victory over his opponent Henrique Capriles Radonski, the Governor of Miranda. Capriles had run in the previous election less than a year before, losing to Chávez by an 11-point margin. This time the margin of victory was much smaller (being 1.49%), and thus became the closest Presidential Election of the country since the 1968 election.

**2018 Venezuelan presidential election**

Presidential elections were held in Venezuela on 20 May 2018, with incumbent Nicolás Maduro being re-elected for a second six-year term. Considered a snap election, the original electoral date was scheduled for December 2018 but was subsequently pulled ahead to 22 April before being pushed back to 20 May. Some analysts described the poll as a show election, with the elections having the lowest voter turnout in the country's democratic era.Several Venezuelan NGOs, such as Foro Penal Venezolano, Súmate, Voto Joven, the Venezuelan Electoral Observatory and the Citizen Electoral Network, expressed their concern over the irregularities of the electoral schedule, including the lack of the Constituent Assembly's competencies to summon the elections, impeding participation of opposition political parties, and the lack of time for standard electoral functions.Because of this, European Union, the Organization of American States, the Lima Group and countries such as Australia and the United States rejected the electoral process. However, countries such as China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia, Syria, Turkey and others recognized the election result.The two leading candidates opposing Maduro, Henri Falcón and Javier Bertucci, rejected the results, saying that the election was critically flawed by irregularities.

&gt; WASHINGTON - The United States announced on Friday it will withdraw from the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia in six months unless Moscow ends its alleged violations of the landmark 1987 arms control pact.

&gt; The announcement may aim to pressure Russia to come to terms during the next six months but it also raised fears of a new U.S.-Russian nuclear arms race in Europe as well as one between the United States and China in Asia.

&gt; &amp;quot;If Russia does not return to full and verifiable compliance with the treaty within this six-month period by verifiably destroying its INF-violating missiles, their launchers, and associated equipment, the treaty will terminate,&amp;quot; Pompeo told reporters.

This is how it started in Europe and they are trying to do the same here. Muslims want to normalize themselves as candidates, so it won't seem unusual to see their names on ballots. 

They can be stopped by outing them for what they are and what they represent. Every candidate must be *publicly* and *repeatedly* confronted and asked where they stand on Sharia:

* ""Do you condemn and reject Sharia, which abolishes the first amendment and freedom of speech?""

* ""Do you condemn and reject Sharia, which abolishes equal justice under the law?""

* ""Do you condemn and reject Sharia law, which allows wife-beating?""

* ""Do you condemn and reject Mohammed's advise to use deception when dealing with non-Muslims? Yes or no?""

* ""What is the highest law in the United States? Is it *your* Sharia or *our* Constitution?""

*Hang Sharia and Mohammed around the neck of each and every Muslim candidate and elected official.* Make Sharia a constant political issue.

Yes, the Muslims will lie. It doesn't matter because **the goal is to educate every voter who is watching and listening.**

Sabe aquela história de que brasileiro não desisti nunca. Bem isso. Se era para morrer, morreria tentando ser eu mesma. Também tinha certeza absoluta que nunca passaria de um homem de saia. Que me tornaria um pária social. Que perderia amigos e família. Não poderia estar mais errada. A cada dia que passa me apaixono mais pela pessoa que vejo pelo espelho. Não só não perdi amigos e família como tenho recebido um apoio e aceitação das pessoas ao meu redor que jamais poderia ser concebido.

Title: **Online Relationship - Can we meet before her divorce is completed?**

Original Post: 

&gt; I've been talking with a woman online. I'm from Europe, she's from USA. She has been separated for years, but not legally divorced. She has stuff in both their names and has been dealing with that.  For me to move there and be with her, we need to marry  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;  So the question is: is there any problem at all if we met before her divorce is finalized? Because we'll need later to show evidence that we met and it would be while she's still technically married. If yes, what would be the issues?

What we're speaking about is how much smaller the UK's GDP is compared to what it would be if the Brexit vote had gone the other way. So the point isn't that growth had stopped, but that it has slowed down. Since the referendum the UK's economy grew by about 3.7%. But the estimate is that it would have grown about 6% otherwise.

Anyone who holds onto that belief is a certified moron. Especially in America, 'white' people is an oxymoron because most white people there are actually mutts of some kind. If you believe in white race you're just as stupid as those fuck-nuggets that keep dishing out this 'anti-white male' propaganda.

I mean if you want to play this retarded ethno-race game, the only people that truly qualify as 'white' would be the nordic European folk and people that can trace their lineage back to the caucasus mountains, and have a spotless family tree that supports this. This is more or less nonexistant in America. Almost every white Person over there can probably find some sort of mediterranean roots in their DNA, or other non-White lineage in it.

Just because your skin is 'white' doesn't mean there's such a thing as 'white race'. Nah, chances are you're a genetic mutt already. Not because of some grand genocide plan, but because your ancestors couldn't keep their dick out of that hot piece of spanish or italian ass. 

And before you start moaning; The same principle applies to black people. or whatever other race people believe in. Black people as they exist nowadays across the West aren't 'pure blacks' either. Because there's no such thing as a 'black race'. There's Africans, There's Caribbeans, There's the Island people, There's Jamaicans, so on and so forth. All of these folk have different genetic material, which destroys the idea of 'white/black' race entirely.

Besides, you would actually have to specifically define white race. Just having 'bright' colored skin isn't enough. Italians in that sense aren't 'white', they're Mediterranean. It's an entirely different genotype. Russian/Slavic Folk could be considered white, but at the same time even they have massive differences between Balkan people and Slavic people. Likewise, Balkan and Slavic people have massive genetic differences towards the Nordish folk.

So really, if you want to believe into this white-race conspiracy nonsense and pretend you're some victim of a large conspiracy against your 'own race', Do yourself a favor and get a genetic screening done. Chances are you're a Mutt (especially if born in America) That will have plenty of genomes in there that aren't even remotely Nordic or Aryan.

Our closest ally started taxing canadian steel and aluminum, while threatning to obliterate auto manufacturing. Their lobbies refused to expand pipelines, forcing canadian crude to become worthless. 

Meanwhile, trade negotions with China are going nowhere, because trudeau refused to compromise on a fair deal, in exchange for access to an overhyped chinese market. If they agreed to a deal, chances are, it wouldnt have been fair.

Even worse, Canada is getting flak for follow due process in the arrest of the Huawei CFO. There has been threats of economic consequences. 

Saudi literately issued a royal decree, boycotting Canadian companies on complaints of their abysmal human rights record. As such, Canadian companies like SNC Lavalin lost a third of their value. In return, Canada utilized their strong ties with Turkey to put Saudi in the spotlight in the murder of that journalist. (Seriously, there are so many turkish imports to Canada, especially when it comes to firearms).

I didn't said that, I said I don't trust western news sources about the USSR when they had a long history of anti-communism. Even the most left leaning newspaper had spewed anti-communist propaganda.

&gt; They did it because they were sick of famine and to emulate other Asian nations.

No they did it because Khruschev was a lying opportunist and an embarasment to all socialists worldwide.

&gt; We have the actual documents, signed by Stalin, that prove it was NKVD. Who would try to carry out an easily disproved forgery conspiracy? You're delusional.

Who would carry out a massacre with a stash of foreign weapons for no reason just before a war to try to make it look like they were the Germans when in reality the Germans had plenty of dirt on them, where was absolutely no reason to stage this. You'd think they had better things to spend their money on when they were barely prepared for WW2. They barely had an air force by 1941.

However the Holocaust was already in place by 1940, and the SS had plenty of reasons and they did actually carry out random massacres all the time.

Its much more plausible that it was the SS, just look at what they did to the Warsaw Ghetto. It was definitely the Nazis doing it.

Besides if it was somehow the NKVD can you actually give me a solid reason why would they have done it, instead of just 'Stalin was bad' when they haven't done it anywhere else?

They haven't done it in Ukraine despite them having plenty of right-wingers, and even by your own beliefs the so called 'Holodomor' only affected random peasants.

So why would have Stalin do that when he had no precedent of doing that?

He could have just imprisoned them like any other enemy soldiers. It makes no sense whatsoever.

Please think before you post, swallowing the propaganda is really embarrassing.

&gt; Who would try to carry out an easily disproved forgery conspiracy?

Khruschev.

&gt;  that he never killed one person.

Nobody believes that, he was a revolutionary after all.

&gt; Utterly preposterous, and there is literally no other historian who believes what Furr believes.

This is interesting because even more moderate right-wing historians from Europe question the Holodomor heavily, and have doubts about a lot of things surrounding Stalin. No to mention in China and elsewhere.

Un exemple que j'ai en tête qui illustre plutôt bien ma pensée c'est une loi de 1965 sur les régimes matrimoniaux. C'est une loi préparée par le Doyen Carbonnier.

Si tu ne sais pas qui il est, Carbonnier était l'un des meilleurs juristes français.

Il a fait précédé cette loi d'une étude sociologique poussée pour établir les attentes des français et les effets possibles d'un nouveau régime légal (la communauté réduite aux acquêts est devenue le régime légale par cette loi).

Cette loi est tellement bien rédigée qu'elle pose encore  les fondations des régimes matrimoniaux à ce jour.

A l'inverse, la loi d'introduction du PACS de 1999 a été tellement mal rédigé que de nombreux auteurs de la doctrine souhaitaient qu'elle soit annulée par le Conseil constitutionnel. Elle ne prévoyait même pas la publicité du PACS.

C'est pour moi la différence entre les lois ""politiques"" et les lois ""juridiques"", l'une a dû être introduite le plus rapidement possible sans réelle préparation, l'autre est le fruit d'une très longue préparation conduite par des juristes hors-pair.

Un autre exemple plus récent, la majorité des règlements Européens majeurs (règlements succession, obligations alimentaires, régimes matrimoniaux...) ont tous eu au moins 10 ans de préparation. Leur qualité est très largement supérieure aux textes par exemples des conventions de La Haye qu'ils remplacent.

Todos nós sabemos sobre isso, e todos nós vemos isso. É obvio. Ninguém quer admitir isso, mas está lá.

As pessoas neste subreddit odeiam Buck Allen.

A primeira pergunta a fazer: por quê? Por que vocês todos o odeiam? A resposta óbvia: você não assistiu ele em seu auge.

Explicação provável: Eu sei que a maioria de vocês tem cerca de 14 ou 15 anos de idade. Isso significa que você só entrou no futebol nos últimos dois anos. Então você nunca assistiu Buck em seu auge.

E porque você não assistiu ele em seu auge, você tenta compensar isso mergulhando nas folhas de estatísticas e analisando as pontuações das caixas. Mas aqui está a coisa: o futebol não é jogado em planilhas do Excel. No momento em que alguém menciona ""jardas por transporte"" ou ""classificação QB"", sei que eles não sabem nada sobre futebol.

O jogo de Buck não pode ser encapsulado por um stat. Ele é o segundo maior RB de todos os tempos e um dos 5 melhores jogadores a jogar o jogo.

Então, quando ouço alguém dizer que Todd Gurley é melhor que Buck Allen, eu rio, porque sei que qualquer um que tenha observado Buck em seu auge não pensaria isso. Ao contrário de vocês, eu tenho assistido futebol por um tempo significativo, então eu sei que Buck é melhor.

Você pode estar com ciúmes dos cinco TDs de Buck nesta temporada, ou com inveja de seu status como o maior corredor da história de Ravens, ou o que quer que seja. A menos que você seja um fã de Ravens que assistiu ao futebol em 2000, ou um fã de Ravens que assistiu ao futebol em 2012, você não sabe como é o verdadeiro instinto assassino de sangue frio que vencerá o futebol. E não há nada de errado com isso.

Esse subreddit faria você pensar que Buck não é nem um dos 100 melhores jogadores de todos os tempos.

Portanto, não vá falar besteira sobre jogadores que você não assistiu. Fale sobre seus ""grandes"" como Todd Gurley, o Melhor RB do Mundo ™, mas deixe o Buck falar com os adultos.

Jizo, for example, is seen as the karmic emancipator of children who die before adulthood. One of our national chain grocery stores, Loblaws, was selling Jizo plastic statues as ""lawn ornaments"", which I found expressly distasteful.
2. Some uses are colonial in nature. Buddha heads, for example, tended to get around because the British and other Europeans looted them from Asian archaeological sites, temple grounds, etc. To that end, I generally feel like the Buddha head thing is tied too closely to ignorance and western imperialism, and needs to be addressed more broadly before we can say if it's appropriate or not.

Ultimately, it looks unlikely that the UK could actually be forced to pay the money. Of course, the real cost to this would be a loss of goodwill, I'd argue that if we do end up leaving without an agreement there won't be much goodwill to lose.

I also wonder whether, if a member state that was a net recipient of EU spending and investment were to leave, the EU would insist that it continue to receive funds to the end of the current budgetary period?

The EUs hubris failed to envisage any member state actually deciding to leave, that's why A50 is such an inadequate mechanism for doing this. It makes no provisions for what should happen in respect of a financial settlement. 

On the Gibraltar thing, if the EU want to maintain good relations with the UK and (in particular) if they actually want us to depart with a withdrawal agreement  in place, then they should realise that capitulating to belligerent Spanish demands on a sensitive issue at this stage is unnecessarily inflammatory. It hampers and undermines the goodwill and good faith needed to come to an agreement. It is inherently disrespectful. 

This is the main problem with the EU and why it is incapable of bargaining in good faith. None of the individual member states can be relied upon to bargain in good faith whilst they have the cover of the EU as a whole to shield them, and the facility to essentially blackmail their partners for stupid and controversial concessions. The Commission and the Council have done a remarkable job of keeping quiet and covering up the various fissures between all the member states over the terms of our departure, but rest assured that the supposed unity presented by the Council is a facade erected and maintained for the sole purposes of these negotiations. All sorts of governments are actively, selfishly, steering the debate in way that works towards their benefit, but not that of the EU as a whole. This jeopardises the chance of coming to an accord with the UK. 

The closer we get to no deal, the more the fractures begin to show. For example, there is a willingness amongst a majority of the council (and in particular Germany and France) who are willing to allow a time limit to the backstop. However, so much political capital was invested in backing the RoI on this issue (weaponising the NI border for negotiating leverage) that EU cannot simply roll over them.

In reality, a vocal minority in Ireland are anti-israel, mostly Sinn Fein supporters and their ilk. 

The author, Melanie Phillips, appears to be the one with the obsessional hatred for Ireland and the EU.

She's a british journalist who is supports brexit and thinks only Britain, the US and Israel are special.. one of her claimed reasons for britain being unique in the EU is that it is an island.. which ignores the fact that ireland is an island as well and very much benefits from being part of the EU.

Being apparently pro-brexit already marks her out as being a feckin idiot. 

""Ireland doesn’t understand what it means to be an independent nation."" she says.. typical attitude of the racist, colonialist, dinosaur.

""Ireland itself has a tenuous claim to nationhood"" because the Irish Free State was only established in 1922... another of her nonsensical claims. Apparently ignoring the fact that Israel was founded decades later but somehow has a better claim to nationhood in her twisted mind.

[Racisim against the irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Irish_sentiment) was very common in Britain for centuries and still exists.. perhaps she is cut from the same cloth. 

She is apparently also against gay rights, an anti-vaxer, denies global warming science, publicly opposed an independant ireland, thinks the war on drugs worked wonderfully, calls obama an islamist and thinks the sun shines out of trumps arse.

EU gives airlines deadline for no-deal Brexit
Plan would potentially force sales of shares for carriers to stay in the air
Brussels is to give airline groups such as IAG, owner of British Airways and Iberia, a seven-month deadline to overhaul their shareholder make-up in order to retain full flying rights within the EU if Britain crashes out of the bloc without a deal next month.
The tight adjustment period for airlines, which must show they are majority owned and controlled by EU nationals in order to have full rights to fly through the continent, is outlined in revisions to a draft law seen by the Financial Times.
EU member states are broadly supporting the approach ahead of Britain’s scheduled departure on March 29.
Aviation is a closely-regulated sector that faces a double blow from Brexit, since an abrupt UK departure from the EU would disrupt not only flying schedules but the licenses that carriers currently use to operate, which are administered based on the nationality of shareholders.
Senior EU officials say the proposed seven-month grace period is coupled with exacting requirements and deadlines, which would force carriers such as IAG and Ryanair, which also has a large number of UK shareholders, to potentially trigger forced-sales of shares by non-EU investors.
Plans by airline groups to maintain existing licenses must be presented to regulators within two weeks of the draft law being adopted, which could come later this month.
“That plan shall set out, in a complete and precise manner, the measures intended to achieve full compliance with the [EU] ownership and control requirements as from the 27 October 2019 at the latest,” the draft legislation states. “Where the air carrier has not presented a plan within the [two-week] time limit, the competent licensing authority shall revoke the operating license.”
While Ryanair and Luton-based easyJet say they have contingency plans in place to ensure 50 per cent of their shareholders are EU nationals, potentially by using forced sales of shares, IAG has been reticent in explaining its proposals to cope with a no-deal Brexit.
Independent estimates suggest IAG faces the biggest challenge of all, with some analysts putting its current EU ownership as low as 25 per cent.
Brussels has warned IAG its favoured plan to continue flying freely around Europe would not comply with EU laws, according to senior officials.
At a press conference on Friday, IAG chairman Willie Walsh declined to comment on the work IAG was doing with its Spanish airlines to make them ready for Brexit. He added that he expected the UK and EU to reach “a comprehensive agreement” on Brexit.
An IAG spokesperson said the group was “confident” they would comply with EU ownership rules post-Brexit.
José Luis Ábalos, Spain’s minister of public works, told parliament this week that Iberia and other airlines were “working intensively” to adjust their ownership and control structure to be ready for Brexit.
The enforcement arrangements for the EU’s airline ownership rules are part of a package of emergency laws that aim to keep basic transport services running if Britain leaves without a deal next month.
Spain, France, Finland and Poland led calls to offer far more generous arrangements for hauliers and airline groups, so levels of disruption were reduced in the aftermath of a no-deal Brexit. Spain particularly called for a more relaxed approach to enforcing airline ownership rules.
By contrast the European Commission has pursued a less forgiving approach, arguing future negotiations with Britain would be undermined by offering single market benefits to UK transport groups in a no-deal scenario, even for a temporary period.
The compromise discussed by ambassadors from the other 27 member states extends more operating freedoms to cargo carriers, with a cap on flight numbers. Passenger flights are limited to point-to-point journeys, potentially causing considerable disruption for non-EU airlines operating from the UK.
French calls for hauliers to enjoy full single market rights for a limited period after Brexit was rejected by other member states.
Germany and the Netherlands were among countries calling for a more disciplined approach to contingency measures for a no-deal Brexit, according to a diplomatic note of the meeting.
In its original proposal, the commission avoided giving airlines a period to adjust. At this week’s meeting it noted “the concerns” of several member states over airlines’ ownership and control, including Spain, France, Cyprus, Hungary and Ireland. But EU officials noted “we should not give an uncompetitive advantage to those which did not plan in advance”.

Just to preface by saying obviously I dont know anything about you personally, but by the tone of what you say you have some rather strong preconceived (and a touch dissonant) ideas about local european geopolitics. As an expat living in the EU for 10 years+, I can say that the images being invoked here about new Franco/Germanic empires remind me of listening to my racist granddad around the Christmas dinner table.

Growing up in the Home Counties, I saw plenty of gently insular British conservatives mask their inherent opinions under their classically mild mannered English sensibilities by just ""smiling and walking the dog"". In my experience they tend to look beyond the border wistfully whenever the need to point the finger arises. Different cultures express these things differently.l, let's just say the eastern European conservative is a lot more... passionate.

But forget that, let's just bring a few facts in: Europe has now seen the longest and most profitable peace in its history, and the UK has directly benefited from that by being a part of it. We have most definitely grown stronger as a result. I speak to a wide variety of Europeans regularly and there is more anger towards the politicians who were ""too liberal"" with the migrant crisis than towards whole nations like France or Germany. I agree with the former, but I think its childish to a fault to paint with such broad strokes during this age of complex nuanced economies.

We can talk also about the large scale disinformation campaign online around Brexit too if you like. It was shown recently that older conservatives tend to believe fake news a lot more than other demographics.

It's worth differentiating between two styles (genres, periods) of jazz composition: **tonal** and **modal**.  

Up to 1960 (or thereabouts), jazz tunes were almost entirely the popular standards and show tunes of the previous few decades.  As such, they were composed according to principles any classically-trained composer would understand - albeit with injections of blues here and there.  I.e. there would be plenty of chromatic harmony, mainly secondary chords of various kinds (mainly dominants), substitutions for those, and the occasional borrowed chord - especially (in major keys) the minor iv7, vii^o7 and half-dim ii7 from the parallel minor key.  (7ths of all kinds were the standard chord form.)    
Melodies were usually written first (maybe lyrics before that), and then set to various standard kinds of chord sequence: tonal, key-based, but with those frequent chromatic deviations, modulations in bridges, etc.   
I.e., chords would be chosen to (a) harmonise the melody, (b) follow tonal sequences and cadences, (c) add some jazzy/bluesy chromatic voice-leading here and there.

In the late 1950s, a few forward-thinking jazz musicians and composers sought an escape from that increasingly complex system, into a freer, more open kind of system - more ""impressionistic"".   (A subtext to this among some was the notion that all that tonal harmony was essentially *European* - DWEMs - and jazz was *African-American* - and so deserved a different kind of foundation, a different set of principles.  While classical impressionism was one influence, with some avant garde inspiration from composer/theorist George Russell, bigger (deeper) influences came from Africa, from gospel music, and the blues.)

This produced the style known (rather inappropriately) as ""modal jazz"".  It distinguished itself from the earlier style essentially by (a) the use of quartal harmony and (b) the avoidance of functional changes.   
One ""mode"" would be maintained for some time (often 16 bars or more), and any changes would be to a different mode - rather like a direct modulation to a different key, except that within each mode there were no appreciable chord changes, no harmonic movement.  It was all about the ""mood"", a meditative, experimental approach to melodic improvisation - not bound by chord changes, only by the scale material of the mode.   

There were still ""compositions"" in this style, of course;  often following the old 32-bar AABA form (the so-called ""chorus"" of the popular standards), with written melodies to bookend the improvised choruses in the middle (as with ""standard"" jazz practice).   But because the harmony was static (shifting abruptly from one stasis to another rather than leading through a ""progression"") the melodies were simple, often little more than riffs.

Some examples:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylXk1LBvIqU  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwmRQ0PBtXU  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtB8dEuEmNM  (NB: some chromatic vamping on the piano in this one)

It was this style of jazz that led to the ""chord-scale theory"" beloved of many jazz academics.  This style of jazz was focused on one chord at a time (not sharing a scale with the chord before or after), and so it made sense that a new kind of theory was invented to describe it.  

But in neither of these styles (tonal or modal) was it the case that you would ""choose a scale that fits the underlying chord"".  The theory might imply that (if you misread it anyway), but it's not really how jazz composition works.  (It's even debatable how useful it is for improvisation.)

In ""modal jazz"", scale and chord are really the same thing.  So it makes no sense to say you choose a scale that fits the chord.  If you choose to write in (say) dorian mode, then that's your scale, and the chords used could be almost random quartal voicings from the mode. The melody would obviously also come from the same set of notes.  Chromaticism would not generally be used, except (very occasionally) in solos.  
There would be no ""chord progressions"" within the mode - just occasionally two discrete voicings would be used in alternation, a primary chord and a contrasting one (as in the head of 'So What' above).; but often not even that.  This is crucial:  *modal harmony (at least in jazz) does not work like tonal harmony*, with full sets of chords for each one.   One mode = one chord, or (in effect) none.

In old-fashioned tonal jazz, the chord sequence comes from the key to begin with, and chromatic harmonies may be introduced to produce more interesting voice-leading.  No chord has its own scale, just alterations to the key scale.  

In *improvisation* (as opposed to composition), it's quite common to talk about individual chord-scales, but that's just a system of short-cuts for learning the material available.  E.g., the idea of the ""altered scale"" on a V7 chord derives from the various chromatic alterations to the chord which assist the voice-leading.  Players who might find that flexible functionality (varying with context) confusing can just ""play the altered scale"" and get all the correct notes automatically.   IOW, chord-scale theory is a cookie-cutter approach to improvisation.  It has no useful role in composition (you don't even need it to understand modal jazz).",True,False,False,,0,1549106643,,1549108064,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",efl3gfw,False,t3_am7b92,True,t3_am7b92,/r/musictheory/comments/am7b92/jazz/efl3gfw/,False,,1553428458,1,True,False,musictheory,t5_2qrjj,r/musictheory,public,,

crabbone,1512048131.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_e3qdk15,False,"Well, usually, all the praise of Unicode comes from people who know very little about it, and are really very superficial thinkers.  There are many problems with this standard.

Chauvinism
----------

This standard declares that Latin alphabet is better than all those creepy moonspeek languages.  Therefore it will have an encoding that makes storing information in Latin languages more efficient than in other languages.  Yes, I know, it's ""only"" UTF-8 encoding, but, imagine for a second, there was a different encoding which would say, make Georgian alphabet use 1 byte and everyone else 2+ bytes.  Well, nobody would support that, and you would be back in square one with the same problem Unicode was supposed to solve.  However, now Unicode made it so that full implementation of the standard is about 100 times more difficult than what it would cost you to implement ANSI standard.  Effectively gatekeeping national industries from ever getting ahead in this competition.

Stagnation
----------

There are technical problems with certain languages and Unicode.  Languages evolve, some add characters, some remove them, but as long as there is a single body which has to coordinate the change, it means now that the change can no longer be local.  Every time Ukrainian language decides they want to add a new letter, like Ґ, Chinese publisher must update.  Oh, but not prior to Unicode standardizing the change.  Another example of this problem: Hebrew subset of Unicode is lacking its own punctuation, while, Arabic, for example, does have its own codepoints for commas, dots etc.  So, what happens when you write in Hebrew is like this: you type a word in Hebrew, then you type ""comma"", and the line is flipped from RTL to LTR order, or something even more bizarre happens, usually things get shuffled around and it takes a while for you to figure out if you made a typo, or it's supposed to be like that.  And then you need to employ all sorts of tricks when sending emails in Hebrew so that your peer could understand what the fuck you are trying to say.  Now, suppose Hebrew would be given its own punctuation: what happens to all of the texts already existing in digital form, where punctuation is broken?

Oh, but if you thought that Arabic has it easier... Arabic Unicode has its own set of digits.

&gt; Matching Mole was an English progressive rock band associated with the Canterbury scene. Robert Wyatt formed the band in October 1971 after he left Soft Machine and recorded his first solo album The End of an Ear. He continued his role on vocals and drums and was joined by David Sinclair, of Caravan, on organ and piano, Phil Miller on guitar, and Bill MacCormick, formerly of Quiet Sun, on bass. The band name is a pun on Machine Molle, the French translation of the name of Wyatt's previous group Soft Machine. 

&gt; Their first, eponymous album was released in April 1972, the bulk of which was composed by Wyatt himself, with the exception of the lush mellotron-laced ""O Caroline"" (a Dave Sinclair composition with lyrics by Wyatt about his recent breakup with girlfriend, Caroline Coon) and Phil Miller's ""Part of the Dance"". For their second album, Matching Mole's Little Red Record, released in November 1972 and produced by Robert Fripp, Sinclair was replaced by New Zealand-born keyboard player and composer Dave MacRae who had already played a guest role on the first album. This album was more of a team effort, with Wyatt concentrating on lyrics and vocal melodies and leaving the composing to his bandmates.

&gt; Matching Mole disbanded in late September 1972 immediately upon completion of a European tour supporting Soft Machine, with Sinclair and Miller going on to form the more successful Hatfield and the North. A new lineup consisting of Wyatt, MacCormick, ex-Curved Air keyboardist Francis Monkman, and jazz saxophonist Gary Windo - was due to record a third album in 1973, but this was cancelled when Wyatt fell from a window and was paralyzed from the waist down and was therefore unable to continue drumming. He later recovered and embarked on a celebrated solo career, but Matching Mole was no more. In early 2000's, Cuineform Records reissued some of the band's archived live recordings as two live albums, Smoke Signals (2001) and March (2002). Read more on Last.fm.

My partner and bestie had conspired to get me a Christmas present, which was really nice of them. (My partner doesn't know much about 40K, so he enlisted help.) My bestie knew that I wanted Mortarion, but probably wouldn't get around to buying him. Unfortunately my bestie suggested that my partner get it from Wayland Games, as opposed to somewhere cheaper and better, like Dark Sphere, Eastern Fringe, or Triple Helix.

I've had really long wait times from Wayland Games in the past due to restocking (I think I once waited more than two months for a restock) and dispatch issues, and their customer support is *terrible*. After we reported that it hadn't arrived two weeks after the stated dispatch, they made us wait another two weeks to report it lost, during which time they *closed the support ticket* due to ""inactivity"". After we'd done that they dragged things out for another week, including making my partner sign a form for their insurance claim.

I'd already resolved never to buy from Wayland Games again previously, but now I want to encourage others to do the same. They might be Europe's biggest models retailer, but that doesn't mean they're *good*.

Edit: Another thing, they've made any goodwill gestures that you'd expect from a large company when their service is substandard. The most I ever got was them to ship part of my order separately after more than a month waiting for them to get some parts of the order in stock. (As noted above, I waited more than a month for the rest to come in, during which time I was completely left in the dark about the status because they blanked the details.) Even worse is the fact that as a larger retailer, they can order more than once a week from GW (smaller ones are limited to one a week).

[deleted],,,,,,,dark,,,,"Honestly, you will find people on here that dislike Islam to various degrees for various reasons, ranging from casual suspicion to irrational hate. I believe most of us stick to the American ideal of being welcoming to those who would not just accept, but embrace America for all that it is though.

We range here (in TD) from atheists, to agnostics, to the devout. The religious here have abandoned the parts of their books that are cruel and/or violent, and when looking to the world stage at Islamic countries you do not see that so much and that gives rise to suspicion and fear. I must admit I have certain qualms.

Seeing parallel societies spring up in Europe of people who do not adopt the values of their adopted land is disconcerting. The problem with rape gangs in the UK being let run free for fear of being perceived as ""racist"" is especially alarming.

But Europe acted irresponsibly with their immigration policy and many places it seems were overzealous in their desire to be progressive, demanding their citizens adapt rather than having a policy which would allow the newcomers to adapt in a smooth transition. Immigration to a new land is a privilege, not a right as so many progressives believe. The problems in Europe, I believe, are something that can be avoided in the US by having better policy, whatever that may be, so as to avoid a massive culture shock and allowing people to acclimate to each other.

Anyway, if you are a Trump supporter, are generally centrist to conservative, and believe in America First you will find a home here among us pedes.

I understand that the LCK definitely appeals to a different audience than say the EU and NA and I appreciate there will be differences. I just think the LCS and LEC have gone too far down the production side of things, I think they could take a leaf out of the LCKs book here.

I told you in my previous reply, you can easily get a higher up source to confirm something like this, and we already knew as others had written similar things before. This isn't new. Getting someone high up to confirm information that's already out there is easy. Having a source willing to let you break that information is entirely different. I've never seen Hughes do that, yet further down in the article he attempts to - although not citing any sources then. Citing one source in an article doesn't mean everything in it is confirmed by that source. It means the specific thing the source is said to have confirmed is confirmed by the source, and nothing else. I hate arguing from authority, but I'm a journalist and I know how it works. 

&gt; This isn't strictly true, as recently as under Conte, Abramovich visited the manager and the players during a bad patch of form, he was well known for attending senior as well as youth games too before his visa troubles. Whilst he most likely wasn't sat at Marina's desk with her going over the day to day issues at the club it's unlikely he isn't told what's going on as he is the owner and he doesn't have to be in the UK to receive phone calls or emails.

That was Conte's first season iirc. Abramovic was nowhere to be seen last season, and his situation has only gotten worse since. Issues with his visa, underlying issues with Russian - British relations he's directly involved in and being investigated over, a divorce still going on, as well as all the other business he's got to take care of. Nobody has mentioned any involvement from Roman in recent months, and the last instance of him actually interacting with a manager was reportedly when he met Sarri after his appointment was confirmed. Nothing about contacts with managers. And again, nobody else has talked about it. And do you honestly think Hughes is the only person who knows about it? Because everyone else would specifically include it in their pieces if they did. 

&gt; So which is it? Is it only a reasonable and trustworthy source when it says positive things about Sarri? What Law has written there is in line with what Hughes has written, and there's zero reason why both journalists need to have the exact same sources when it comes to getting information for articles.

It's not fully in line with Hughes, though. Hughes writes Sarri's job isn't in danger. In fact, I find Law's information here very interesting, because it goes against what Fifield, Johnson and Kinsella have written - which is that the club remain fully behind Sarri. 

I've also read conflicting information on whether Sarri's approach is under scrutiny from the board. Some are going as far as saying they're demanding a 'Plan B', then others come out and say that's wrong. I honestly don't know what's true here. 

The third paragraph is a list of players who wanted to leave this winter. CHO handed in a transfer request, of course he wanted to leave. That doesn't say anything about whether the dressing room wants him to play more. There's a difference. And the dressing room rumor I've seen shot down by someone, although I can't for the life of me find the damn thing or remember who it was. 

And Law, Johnson, etc. drop his name a lot when management decisions are involved, yet once a decision actually happens, they always report that it's Marina making them. My guess is that Abramovic is simply dropped because he's the owner of the club and used to make decisions previously. 

There are definitely some true things in there, but Hughes also interprets and changes context, like I said. And I definitely don't consider him the most reliable Chelsea source there is.

Then Maastricht transfers monetary policy to the ECB behind barriers completely untouchable by political dialogue, therefore removing from national hands further instruments of shaping their social reality but leaving them that responsibility, and upping the tax and social competition between members to new levels.

Then the widening of Europe in the 2000's introduced countries with much lower fiscal and social requirements in their policies, that's again added competition.

Then comes TSCG in 2012 after the crisis with coordination around ""fighting deficits and debts"" to stifle countercyclical spending. The only point of light is perhaps the renewed attention for the latter.

&gt;We need data. My suppositions and anyone's doubts don't mean anything. The reason why I bring this up is because I've heard it mentioned by practicing medical doctors. 

The reason I didn't cite any data is because you're the one making claims - the burden of proof is on you. I'm just addressing your claims based on my own direct experience as a healthcare provider. 

&gt;If someone is dead before the ambulance shows up, the medical expenses may not cost too much (though ambulances are expensive). But many people get in accidents and don't die, but instead required emergency surgeries etc.. 

Heart disease: 635,260

Cancer: 598,038

Accidents (unintentional injuries): 161,374

Chronic lower respiratory diseases: 154,596

Stroke (cerebrovascular diseases): 142,142

Alzheimer’s disease: 116,103

Diabetes: 80,058

Influenza and Pneumonia: 51,537

Nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and nephrosis: 50,046

Intentional self-harm (suicide): 44,965

That's from the CDC data you linked. I was surprised to see accidental deaths so high up, but it's still less than 200k annual deaths, while the two leading causes constitute over 1.2mn. Also note that the two leading causes are chronic illnesses which cost the healthcare system a ton annually. While you're correct that not all accidental deaths are ""free"" for the healthcare system, it's obvious that accidents and injuries are less chronic and more acute than all the other causes of death on that list, and from there it's not a stretch to say they're the cheapest thing on the list to deal with per person affected. 

&gt; Respectively, this is so far from a correct description of the situation, that no reasonable person could take your opinion seriously. The US medical system is a mix of private and public and has massive amounts of government involvement at every step. And most developed countries around the world have a mix of private and public healthcare. 

The USA spends vastly more per capita on healthcare than any other developed nation - we know that, it's the basis of our discussion. Pointing the finger at small-scale differences which may or may not exist like road traffic accidents without data to back it is clearly not what constitutes such a huge difference. There is one glaring difference which is that, unlike the US, almost every other developed country with mixed public and private healthcare to varying degrees still has universal access to basic care as a cornerstone of their system. The US has historically never had this or even anything resembling it until recently. It's easy to say ""It could be this, it could be that"" but the reality is that the one most glaringly obvious difference between the US and the rest of the world is a good place to start on the topic of ""Why does the US pay so much for healthcare?"" 

&gt;Double edit: US murder rate is over 5 times greater than the rates of most Europe (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate#United_States)

Again, this is a drop in the ocean. Good discussion point about what's wrong with the US but it is better placed in another context.

&gt; 
&gt; “Hay que encontrar una salida dialogada”. La frase suena bien, agradable al oído. Simpática para el oyente. Agustín Rossi, jefe político de los diputados kirchneristas, la pronuncia en una entrevista radial, mientras habla de lo que ocurre en Venezuela.
&gt; 
&gt; En ese espacio también hay lugar para voces un poco más duras. Como la del diputado Andrés Larroque, que propone ""tener una postura firme y clara con respecto a lo que está pasando en Venezuela"", al tiempo que pide “respetar la voluntad popular” y hacer los “esfuerzos para lograr instancias de acuerdo”.
&gt; 
&gt; Los hechos, obstinados, se encargan de poner límites a la propuesta que enarbolan Rossi, Larroque y el bloque de diputados del FpV.
&gt; 
&gt; Este jueves por la mañana, [a 72 horas de que EE.UU. decretara un brutal embargo petrolero](https://www.laizquierdadiario.com/Sancion-norteamericana-a-PDVSA-un-salto-en-la-ofensiva-imperialista-contra-Venezuela), el Parlamento Europeo decidió reconocer a Juan Guaidó como presidente de Venezuela.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Ante la situación en curso, la **“salida negociada”** –que impulsan países como México y Uruguay- carece de realidad material. Por un lado, porque la avanzada golpista se desarrolla [apostando al colapso económico de Venezuela y al quiebre al interior de sus Fuerzas Armadas](http://www.laizquierdadiario.com/Las-presiones-imperialistas-y-la-catastrofe-economica-elevan-la-incertidumbre-en-Venezuela). Por otro, porque una ""salida negociada"" implicaría concesiones a los sectores que hoy impulsan esa salida golpista.
&gt; 
&gt; A la ofensiva imperialista se la debe enfrentar activamente, con la denuncia permanente, pero también con la acción en las calles. El martes pasado el **Frente de Izquierda** se movilizó a la Cancillería argentina. Lo hizo para denunciar la política del imperialismo norteamericano y el apoyo a la misma que dan gobiernos como el de Macri y Bolsonaro.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; En sentido contrario, ante la avanzada golpista, **el kirchnerismo**  repite el _modus operandi_ utilizado frente al ajuste macrista. Palabras fuertes, calles vacías y acciones esencialmente simbólicas. Este jueves se llamó a una Vigilia Antiimperialista en la Embajada de Venezuela, pero no hay ningún nombre y/o corriente de peso entre sus convocantes.
&gt; 
&gt; Sin embargo el kirchnerismo podría actuar con una potencia mucho mayor. Tiene, como se sabe, lugar central en dirección de gremios como Suteba, Foetra, Subte o ATE Capital. Esa fuerza, junto a las sus agrupaciones juveniles como La Cámpora, podría ser puesta en las calles para rechazar el intento golpista. Sin embargo, lo que prima es la moderación.
&gt; 
&gt; ### El silencio y las urnas
&gt; 
&gt; El comunicado y las declaraciones de los diputados kirchneristas contrastan vivamente con el silencio ensordecedor que -ante la avanzada golpista- transita Cristina Kirchner.
&gt; 
&gt; La ex mandataria prefiere omitir el tema. Su mutismo se explica por simple cálculo electoral. Aquel relato de la “patria grande” está guardado bajo siete llaves, en aras de no incomodar a eventuales votantes. Los discursos (tibiamente) anticolonialistas pertenecen a un pasado remoto que, en tiempos de elecciones, es mejor no sacar a relucir.
&gt; 
&gt; Esa **mecánica del silencio** no es nueva. Durante la discusión por el derecho al aborto que cruzó al Congreso y al país en 2018, CFK prolongó por meses su definición sobre un tema que compromete la vida de las mujeres. Luego vendría el pedido de “no enojarse” con la Iglesia y el llamado a “unir pañuelos celestes y verdes”. Es decir, a poner límites al reclamo por el aborto legal para no espantar votos “pro-vida”.
&gt; 
&gt; La actual ausencia de pronunciamientos acompaña las negociaciones internas que recorren al peronismo. Entre esas filas surgieron a velocidad luz los pronunciamientos de apoyo a Guaidó y la avanzada imperialista. [Massa, Urtubey y Pichetto fueron las caras más visibles del  _**trumperonismo**_](https://www.laizquierdadiario.com/Trumperonismo-Massa-Pichetto-y-Urtubey-saludaron-la-embestida-golpista-en-Venezuela). Los llamados a la unidad que brotan desde las filas kirchneristas se encuentran con ese obstáculo, nada menor.
&gt; 
&gt; ### Aquella olvidada “patria grande”
&gt; 
&gt; Latinoamérica presenció un veloz avanzada de la derecha en los últimos años. Si la vía electoral fue una de sus variantes, los golpes institucionales fueron otro. Ahí están Macri y Bolsonaro como ejemplos patentes para ilustrarlo.
&gt; 
&gt; Pero esa avanzada dejó al desnudo los límites de las transformaciones proclamadas por los gobiernos posneoliberales, también llamados populistas. La “unidad” latinoamericana se limitó a la construcción de espacio políticos como la Unasur y la producción de múltiples declaraciones de solidaridad.
&gt; 
&gt; ### &gt; Te puede interesar: [Patria Grande, ilusiones chicas](http://www.laizquierdadiario.com/ideasdeizquierda/patria-grande-ilusiones-chicas/)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Bajo gestiones como las de **Lula, CFK o Chávez**, las naciones del Cono Sur no se sustrajeron a la dominación del gran capital imperialista. La avanzada de la derecha en Brasil, Argentina y Venezuela tiene el aval de un poder económico, judicial y mediático que pisa en terreno firme dentro de las fronteras nacionales. La “lucha contra las corporaciones” tuvo un alto grado de retórica.
&gt; 
&gt; Allí también habrá que buscar una cuota de las razones que explican el silencio de la ex presidenta. En la Argentina, el kirchnerismo se postula como fuerza gobernante nuevamente. Esa postulación supone y obliga a una moderación que evapore los temores empresarios ante el “retorno del populismo”. Temores que siempre es preciso relativizar porqué, como ya fue dicho, entre 2003 y 2015, el gran capital “se la llevó en pala”.
&gt; 
&gt; Eso y no otra cosa es lo que buscan los mensajes conciliadores del [ex ministro Kicillof](http://www.laizquierdadiario.com/Kicillof-confirmo-que-no-romperia-con-el-FMI-luchas-por-trabajo-y-preparativos-para-el-G20) y [de la ex presidenta](http://www.laizquierdadiario.com/Cristina-Kirchner-recrea-su-relato-y-le-habla-al-empresariado-como-mejor-garante-de-sus-ganancias) hacia el gran capital y el FMI.
&gt; 
&gt; Así las cosas, el kirchnerismo se debate entre un llamado impotente “al diálogo” y un silencio basado en el puro cálculo electoral. Mientras tanto, en la “patria grande”, el imperialismo norteamericano avanza con su ofensiva golpista.

Das ist eher der Verdienst der deutschen Tarifautonomie, die - mit einem gewissen time-lag - Deutschland wieder wettbewerbsfähig machte.

&gt; Von vielen Politikern werden die Arbeitsmarkt-Reformen der Agenda 2010 als entscheidende Faktoren für Deutschlands „wirtschaftlichen Erfolg“ angeführt.[7]
&gt; 
&gt; Nach Ansicht der Ökonomen Christian Dustmann, Bernd Fitzenberger, Uta Schönberg und Alexandra Spitz-Oener würden die Deutschland zugeschriebenen „wirtschaftlichen Erfolge“ im Anschluss an die Agenda-Reform dieser jedoch fälschlicherweise zugeschrieben. In ihrem Aufsatz im Journal of Economic Perspectives argumentieren sie, dass nicht die Hartz-Reformen und auch nicht die Handelsbilanzen in der Euro-Zone die Grundlagen des wirtschaftlichen Erfolgs Deutschlands seien.[8]:S. 184.[7] Ökonomen sehen seit der Deutschen Wiedervereinigung eine Verschlechterung der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit Deutschlands, da sich die Deutsche Bundesbank aufgrund Inflationsdrucks und steigender Staatsverschuldung zu einer restriktiven Geldpolitik veranlasst sah, was den Wechselkurs der DM steigen ließ. Auch der Euro-Beitritt erfolgte zu einem überhöhten Wechselkurs. Um das Preisniveau zu korrigieren, sei eine Innere Abwertung insbesondere durch Reallohnverluste erforderlich gewesen.[9][10][11] Diese notwendige Verbesserung der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit sei aber nicht der Reformpolitik, sondern der Unabhängigkeit der Lohnverhandlungen von der staatlichen Gesetzgebung und dem im internationalen Vergleich einzigartigen Zusammenspiel der deutschen Tarifpartner bei der Entscheidung über Löhne und Tarifverträge mithilfe der Tarifautonomie zuzuschreiben. Die typisch deutschen Arbeitsmarktinstitutionen der Arbeitgeberverbände, Gewerkschaften und Betriebsräte seien die Voraussetzung dafür, dass flexibel auf außergewöhnliche ökonomische Situationen reagiert werden könne, wie sie die Deutsche Wiedervereinigung und die Osterweiterung der EU darstellten. Die Tarifpartner könnten so bei der Lohnfindung auf die konjunkturelle Lage je nach Branche, Region oder sogar innerhalb der Unternehmen selbst Rücksicht nehmen, unabhängig von gesetzlichen Regelungen wie etwa Mindestlöhnen oder den Arbeitszeiten, und sich im gegenseitigen Einvernehmen einigen.[8]:S. 168.

&gt; DUBAI - Iran displayed a new cruise missile with a range of 1,300 km on Saturday during celebrations marking the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution, state television reported.

&gt; Iran has expanded its missile program, particularly its ballistic missiles, in defiance of opposition from the United States and expressions of concern by European countries.

&gt; Amirali Hajizadeh, head of the Revolutionary Guards&amp;#039; aerospace division, said at the event Iran had overcome initial problems in producing jet engines for cruise missiles and could now manufacture a full range of the weapons.

For example, we can’t say that Europeans are on average taller than African Americans for genetic reasons, because the variance between the European and African American samples is on a similar scale to the variance within both groups. 

The same has as far as I am aware applied to the structural brain differences, and considering how little we know about how brain structure affects psychological and cognitive measurable, beyond extreme cases such as pre-frontal vortex damage, we could never claim that these differences cause any particular variation in other factors between men and women.

As for the IQ differences, I’m again very sceptical. I accept the greater male variability hypothesis on a trait level, but I’m not sure about how it propagates forward. It’s not clear that the greater variance in genetics and gene expression should propagate to a similar level of greater variation in highly composite and abstract measures like IQ.

And I’m even more sceptical about how it would apply to something like schooling ability. In the developed world, women are doing better at the lower levels of education (school and undergraduate), and then suddenly much worse at higher levels. It reeks more of social factors than anything else. I’m not aware of any correlates beyond social factors, nothing physiological that would cause this change without simultaneously affecting males as well, like nutritional differences would. If this was a matter of greater male variability, then we would observe some men consistently underperforming against women and some proportion consistently over performing against women, and while this is true to some extent, the proportion performing better against women is considerably smaller than the proportion underperforming in comparison, which simply doesn’t match a greater variability profile.",True,False,False,,0,1549119688,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",efle6ts,False,t3_amahfo,True,t1_eflc1h1,/r/slatestarcodex/comments/amahfo/large_preregistered_experiment_of_stereotype/efle6ts/,False,,1553433482,-4,True,False,slatestarcodex,t5_30m6u,r/slatestarcodex,public,,

Its frustrating. Sometimes I wish we'd just pass a hard and heavy Carbon Tax on a federal level and dare Albertan oil interests to do something about it. So I see the appeal in voting Green, especially as a protest vote. I actually might still do that in my ultra-safe Liberal riding.

&gt;A Russian woman who schemed to build back-channel ties between the Russian government and the Trump campaign pleaded guilty in federal court on Thursday to conspiring to act as a clandestine foreign agent.

&gt;Maria Butina also sought to connect Moscow unofficially with other parts of the conservative establishment, including the National Rifle Association and the National Prayer Breakfast.

&gt;...**""The diplomacy project""**

&gt;Butina worked in concert with her boyfriend, GOP fundraiser Paul Erickson, and a Russian handler, Alexander Torshin, who also cultivated his own relationships with important conservatives in the United States.

&gt;...Butina and Torshin moved in gun rights circles in the United States and, according to court documents, she and other Russians also arranged to host NRA members in Moscow in late 2015.

&gt;""During the trip, the gun rights organization members met with high-level Russian government officials as arranged by"" Torshin, according to court documents in the Butina case.

&gt;...**The back channel**

&gt;Butina's work with her compatriots, meanwhile, continued. Erickson, for example, sent an email to the office of then-Sen. Jeff Sessions, working as a Trump campaign booster, offering to use his NRA connections to establish a back channel between the Trumps and the Russian government.

&gt;...Although Torshin later met Donald Trump Jr. at an event during an NRA convention, Butina and her colleagues were not able to broker a conference between then-candidate Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

&gt;The work ran through Election Day 2016 and into the following year, when Torshin instructed Butina about which Russian attendees to arrange to become part of a delegation to the National Prayer Breakfast on Feb. 2, 2017.

&gt;Later, Erickson said in an email message on which Butina was cc'd:

&gt;""Reaction to the delegation's presence in America will be relayed DIRECTLY [emphasis in original] to the Russian President and Foreign Minister.""

That, where the new revolutionary ideas had resulted in disillusionment and resentment against the French hegemony, this had by and large not resulted in a return of the leadership and of the masses towards the previous models of government and social organization, outside of the formal structure of the Restoration States. And this not only for the material impossibility of achieving such an integral restoration, but also for the fact that the same men who had arranged for the Italian return to the *status quo ante* - Metternich, Castlereagh, Tayllerand, Hardenberg, Kapodistrias – were not of the opinion that such integral restoration was possible or even advisable. And their model of government for the Italian States was a moderate application of the same principles they had been using in their own domains – and that's without even considering that in large part the concept of legitimacy was to be tempered with that of equilibrium (hence the substantial alterations to the Italian borders taking place in a few states), while the Prince Metternich made no secret of the fact that he intend to develop a system of indirect political hegemony over the Italian States. 

The restoration of the Bourbon of Naples in 1815 had been negotiated during the Summer – beyond the public Treaty of Casalanza and the two Conventions (which already stipulated for the Neapolitan Army to be led by an Austrian general and for the Kingdom to provide the Austrians with troops for the “defense of Italy”), with the addition of a secret clause stating:

&gt; il est entendu entre les hauts parties contractantes que S. M. le roi des Deux Sicilies, en retablissant le governement du royaume, n'admettra aucun changement qui ne pourrait se concilier, soit avec les anciennes institutions monarchiques, soit avec les principes adoptes par S. M. Imperiale et Royale Apostolique pour le regime interieur de ses provinces italiennes.

&gt; the contraent parties mutually agree that H. M. the king of the Two Siciles, in reestablishing the government of his kingdom, won't allow for any chance that would be in disagreement, both with the ancient monarchical institutions, and with the principles employed by H. M. Imperial and Royal Apostolic for the internal administration of his Italian provinces. [my translation from French]

A clause that was explicitly directed to prevent the introduction of a constitution within the Kingdom of Naples, or of any reforms that had not been previously introduced by the Austrians in their Italian dominions – and the Austrians had indeed attempted to establish similar provisions for the Kingdoms of Piedmont (the Piedmontese king Victor Emmanuel I, who had a reputation for being anti-Austrian, could leverage on the natural reluctance of the British and French to the idea of a Piedmontese satellite of Austria, which also contributed to the decision to add the former Republic of Genoa to the Kingdom) and for the Papal States (where they had nonetheless gained the right to maintain military forces within the “legation states”, the provinces subject to the Papal administration across the Apennines). 

In Naples, the restoration had brought therefore to a moderate-conservative Monarchical regime, cautiously inspired to the principles of absolutism – but also careful not to antagonize the Church, both for internal reasons and because good relations with the Holy See appeared instrumental to stabilize those with Vienna. The two most significant personalities of the new Government were Luigi de'Medici, the Minister of Finances, and Donato Tomasi, the Minister of Justice, while the position of Secretary of State had been assigned to the mediocre (and more reaction oriented) Marquis of Circello. The most violent aspects of the transition from Murat to Ferdinand I had been avoided thanks to the conciliatory policy of Medici who favored an “amalgamation” of the monarchical forces loyal to Murat with those loyal to the Bourbon, in a conscious effort to isolate the democratic-republican groups; and also thanks to the explicit opposition of Metternich and Castlereagh, who had witnessed the results of the first short lived restoration of 1799. For this reason (sanctioned with an express stipulation in the secret portion of the Convention of June 12^th ) the state functionaries and members of the military who had served under Murat and Giuseppe Bonaparte were allowed to maintain their positions as well as continuing to develop a political action. It is worth noting that those forces: monarchical conservative, moderate constitutional (identified with the model of the French Charter of 1814, with one elective Chamber and one Chamber of the Lords), democratic constitutional (identifying with the Spanish Constitution of 1812, with one elective Chamber), republican – they all operated in a sort of contiguity, transitioning from the proper national leadership to clandestine groups, in a network of complex relations, intrigues, combinations and conflicts of ideas and practical developments. So that, at the moment when some of those plans were about coming to fruition, men of different orientations would often move forward with their own version of what had to be done, and for what ultimate end.

In this pattern of confusion – common to other regions but perhaps more marked in the Kingdom of Naples – the most clear cut alternative view within the Government was represented by Antonio Capece Minutolo, the Prince of Canosa, who advocated for a complete removal of all the public functionaries employed during the ten years of the Napoleonic Kingdom (something we'll be able to return to later) and the introduction of energetic measures against any “subversive” organization. Canosa – who was far from the most “enlightened” of the Italian reactionaries, and lacked the elegant prose and natural talent for polemic arguments of De Maistre, but not his relentlessness – took charge of the Ministry of Police in January 1816. A place he held until June 1816, when his attempts to build a “counterweight” to the constitutional-democratic groups by supporting and recruiting reactionary elements among the fractions of the population more susceptible to his “encouragements” culminated in a generalized climate of social tension that brought the Austrian and Russian Ambassadors to intervene, together with Medici, urging the King to dismiss him. Canosa left the Kingdom of Naples for Tuscany. 

His departure coincided with the opening of the phase of attempted reorganization of the Kingdom in a moderate absolute monarchy made by Medici along the lines of the aforementioned principle of the *amalgama*. To restore some degree of social peace, Medici immediately passed legislation (August 8^th 1816) forbidding all secret societies – the law, which made all secret societies illegal was more effective against (and at least partly tailored to) the reactionary society of the *Calderari*, which had been supported and – allegedly – directed by Canosa. While the other, widespread secret society – the *Carboneria* - was left largely untouched, both because of its large diffusion and popularity among the middle classes and the protective action of various prominent figures (among which rumors wanted Medici himself).

Yes.

&gt;I wasn’t aware of that. Are you sure that no ST studies have correctly shown a lack of invariance?

Yes. I am absolutely sure of this, as Wicherts and Flore have been hammering on it for a long time ([Paulette's dissertation is great. It proposes, oddly, the first actual psychometric model for sex ST](http://www.iops.nl/concluded-iops-projects/paulette-flore-3/)). One of the funny things about how ST is analysed is that it uses ANCOVA while implicitly assuming equal covariates and residual invariance. However, if ST is a thing affecting one group, there will obviously not be equal covariates, and the residuals for any of the factors under examination cannot be equal. 

To believe in ST as a meaningful part of sex or race differences, you have to really show conviction about how something which *cannot be correct,* is.

[Flore &amp; Wicherts (2015)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022440514000831) found a small effect size and evidence of publication bias. This study prompted [the large, pre-registered OP study.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23743603.2018.1559647)

[Wicherts has conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of ST for Blacks](http://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/?p=7534), but he has had it in review for a very long time (*A meta-analysis of the effects of
stereotype threat on the cognitive test performance of African Americans.* with de Haan). It's kind of appalling how long this thing has been sitting in review (since at least 2011). I'll reproduce the abstract below:

&gt;Numerous laboratory experiments have been conducted to show that African Americans' cognitive test performance suffers under stereotype threat, i.e., the fear of confirming negative stereotypes concerning one's group. A meta-analysis of 55 published and unpublished studies of this effect shows clear signs of publication bias. The effect varies widely across studies, and is generally small. Although elite university undergraduates may underperform on cognitive tests due to stereotype threat, this effect does not generalize to non-adapted standardized tests, high-stakes settings, and less academically gifted test-takers. Stereotype threat cannot explain the difference in mean cognitive test performance between African Americans and European Americans.

That last sentence, bolded: **""Stereotype threat cannot explain the difference in mean cognitive test performance between African Americans and European Americans.""** In his analysis, the only clear predictor of publication of an ST study was if there was a significant effect. This is unsurprising to those of us who understand ANCOVA and have read, e.g., [Sackett, Hardison &amp; Cullen (2004)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14736315).

KalleMP,1410171091.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_iatqb,False,"&gt;Pipe running up is probably a reservoir to compensate for intermittent dispensing and continuous pumping.  
&gt;  
&gt;Interesting. So there is some reservoir tank above that isn't in the picture? How would it compensate for the dispensing and why is it needed?

It could just be a length of hose that is used to gravity fill the bottles, perhaps a small header tank.  However on looking at it further perhaps it is a return line back into the top of the kettle to prevent settling and maintain a homogeneous mix of sauce.  It would also allow the transfer pump to run a full speed and the overflow to go back in the pot when the bottle is filling.

&gt;You can see the manual override handle on the valve body (cubic unit ) and forked piston attachment. This is used to open and close the dispensing valve. Dispensing pump is either the cylinder behind cubic valve body or a diaphragm pump under stainless steel plate at the back.  
&gt;  
&gt;What is a forked piston attachment? I looked closely but I don't see what you are referring to.

Look to the left of the cubic valve.  There is a white fork (two prongs) with the black handle attached.  This fork would be slipped over the cylindrical peg slightly above and behind it that is driven by the dosing system.  I am thinking the dosing may have been managed with a cam follower for the dispensing piston and some kind of other cam to control the valve.  The rotating cam plate is probably under that stainless steel cover I mentioned might hide a diaphragm pump (I did not like that idea much as they are not positive displacement).  However as I could not see any pneumatic lines it was not obvious how the dispensing piston would be actuated.  I have seen others that use a pneumatic piston for that task and another to control the valve.  Here it looks like they use a motor and gearbox to rotate a cam and use that to operate the dispensing pump.

With viscous product you often use an active valve for the dispenser because you need to direct the product into the dispensing piston (with the transfer pump) and then switch the valve over to eject the product from the dispensing piston into the bottle.  The valve is cycled again and this prevents dripping from the fill nozzle and directs the product into the dispensing piston again while it is pulling back.

&gt;Cylindrical unit on lower hose connected to kettle is likely a strainer.  
&gt;  
&gt;Also interesting. Straining pepper mash is very common so it makes sense. I don't see a strainer discharge though and I imagine it would clog pretty quickly with pepper skin and seeds. Any idea how the strainer works?

The strainer is likely to just be a safety feature to prevent foreign objects reaching the pumps or valve which would be expensively damaged by a random nut or screw.  It is not intended to split the product stream and this has likely been done elsewhere.

While composing this comment I have come to the following conclusion:

The reason for the elaborate pumping loop is probably to maintain a predictable temperature that serialisation requires.  The whole operation is run up to some temperature to ""kill all known bugs dead"" and then there is no question that the product in the hose waiting to be filled has cooled down because it is continuously circulating.  When priming the system or doing a clean in place (CIP) the valve would get locked into position and the dispensing pump would continuously replace the product or wash water in the dispensing cylinder.  This would bring it all up to sterilisation temperature and also provide maximum cleaning.  The valve would then be manually activated a few times to flush the dispensing nozzle as well, either with product or water.  When filling is started the fork would be engaged to the automatic valve control peg.

&gt;  
&gt;Any recommendations for large equipment vendors that I could send this picture to for quotes on the various parts? I am in Eastern Europe and this type of equipment is not easy to come by.  
&gt;  
&gt;Many thanks again for all the help!

I do not know of any specific equipment vendors.  My exposure to the such machines is making repairs to them and personal research for possible projects.  Look up filling machines on YouTube and Google images search and go crazy.  There are dozens of machine vendors.  There are also used production machine  brokers that may have name brand gear you can get spares for at less than the price of new Chinese gear that can be harder to maintain.

Here is a link to a video showing a pneumatically operated unit.  They do not have the continuous pumped product loop that your photo seems to show.

Firstly, cars have got too expensive.  I bought a 3 year old used car in 2012 for £7000.  The 2015 version of the same model, with today's equivalent spec and virtually identical mileage?  £8600.  Both came from official dealerships and the brand in question have increased their servicing costs by 12% since 2012.

If I wanted my 2012 car brand new it would have been £11000.  Today's new model, again, with a *lesser* spec?  £13000.  Getting the same spec as the 2012 model would take it close to £15000.

Brand new cars in the UK are also being brutally pummelled with new VED rates.  Older ones, not so much.

The other thing is nobody knows what on earth is going on with diesels.  If I buy a brand new Euro 6 now, how long will that be ""okay"" until Euro 7 comes along?  Meanwhile I won't be buying that perfectly good 2015 car because it's only a Euro 5 and I can barely take it anywhere without being pummelled with ULEZ charges.  The Euro 5 owner can't sell his car and its value plummets, so a perfectly good 3 year old car has gone to waste and may even just be broken up.

Why bother with that nonsense?  This all feeds into why bangernomics is well worth a look.  That 2006 Ford Focus with 90k miles on the clock, for £3000?  I'll bet you there's naff all wrong with it.

If you have the stomach for it and really know about cars (or know someone who does) then you can get old Jags for sub-£1000.

*The EU’s Working Time Directive regulates employees’ working hours, annual leave, and rest break allowances. The UK’s transposition contains many examples of gold-plating. For example, the directive stipulates 20 days of annual leave, while the UK regulations require 28. Moreover, the record-keeping rules are much more onerous than necessary and the exemption for workers who set their own hours has been transposed so vaguely that it fails to be of use.*

Exactly. Introducing an additional official language almost nobody speaks would way more difficult.

&gt;We can declare Rusyn as an official language, but it's not really going to take off since it is not a lingua franca. English, however, I agree has a better chance, but if the goal is to only have a lingua franca then... what is the purpose of turning it official if it is already the lingua franca?

Because it would give people more freedom. At the moment we have to rely on the good-will that officials in other EU-countries also try to communicate in English. It's just giving people the right to use English in communication (at least with official government institutions). 

&gt;Who in the Netherlands needs this? Why would we spend money on this? Not just that, why would we risk Dutch even more than we already do?

But we are the EU, not just tiny isolated countries. Cross-Country-Communication is necessary. We have too much of local political discussions, but little pan-european public discussion - also due to the different languages. This weakens us. 

&gt;Well, that I can see, but I think that then it would not be an official language. 

Wrong. Many countries have multiple official languages. We have 4 in Austria: German at federal level plus 3 others on regional level. For example in the region where Croatian is an additional official language, people have the right to get their paperworks done either in German *or* Croatian. 

&gt;am not a language fetishist either, however, languages provide a HUGE socio-economic role in European affairs. For example, immigrants (like me) that come to the Netherlands and don't learn Dutch are not really considered well enough integrated because, well, they miss a crucial step: language.

Exactly... because they would not be able to communicate in the Netherlands (despite dutch people usually speak other languages very well). But it probably very much depends on which native language they have. 

&gt;I disagree that it doesn't make local languages fade away, because there are hundreds of thousands of examples, both historical and contemporary, of that exact event happening. If we take a look at how Belarusian is doing in Belarus itself, well, would you seriously tell me that nothing's wrong?

I think it would not happen. The languages will just go hand in hand as they do now. Many people already use English in order to workaround the language barrier. And even if: What would be so terrible about it? 

&gt;Language plays a key role in society, 

Yes, and that's why I support the idea of a English as second, pan-european language. This way we are more like a society instead of just little regional societies.

Fixed that for you.

&gt;nuclear is by far the cheapest power on earth.

There has never been a time in all of recorded history where that was true. During the heyday of buildout in the late 1960s and early 70s, [large-scale hydro was more than three times cheaper](https://books.google.ca/books?id=qfxtbDt7ddQC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;lpg=PA111&amp;dq=electricity+prices+hydro+vs+nuclear+1975&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=R7B-AVcfOP&amp;sig=ACfU3U3dT8eNgUNftbLcx5Z8f6l3L1rrHg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjTsNKqxp3gAhWCxIMKHT1bAWU4ChDoATADegQIAxAB#v=onepage&amp;q=electricity%20prices%20hydro%20vs%20nuclear%201975&amp;f=false). Today the cheapest form of power is wind and solar.

&gt;south korea's apr-1400s tend to cost around 3.5 billion... look to shin hanul or shin kori for numbers, by example

So you want us to look at these examples? OK...

""According to documents about the construction and operating costs for each APR1400 nuclear reactor produced by Korea Hydro &amp; Nuclear Power (KHNP) and released on Oct. 9 by Woo Won-sik, a lawmaker for the Democratic Party, the construction cost on the initial contract for Shin-Kori reactors 3 and 4, on which construction began in 2007, was 5.57 trillion won (**US$4.89 billion**), while the construction cost on the initial contract for Shin-Kori 5 and 6 was 8.63 trillion won (**US$7.58 billion**) – with the cost of construction increasing by 54.9% over nine years.""

These prices are largely in-line with the rest of the world. Darlington B was quoted at $10.80, Vogle is currently around $10, the EPRs in Europe are all over $10/Wp, including [Hinkley Point C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPR_(nuclear_reactor)#Hinkley_Point_C_(United_Kingdom)) which is currently estimated to be 22 billion Euro.

While some sources put the cost much lower, that's because they're quoting the overnight figures, not the all-in costs. This is a  little trick used to bamboozle people who are not familiar with how the financing side works.

&gt;by contrast, ivanpah cost about 2.2 billion

Cherry picking old data. Ivanpah started construction in 2010 and was completed in 2013. It is also a CSP, which is not representative in any way of modern plants. Between 2010 and 2018, the cost of PV has dropped about 5 to 8 times. That drop is even larger compared to a heliostat CSP solution like Ivanpah.

A modern large-scale PV plant like Kamuthi generates 648 megawatts and has a all-in cost of 679 million USD. This is typical of systems in the US as well, at [least in 2017](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy19osti/72399.pdf). This makes it over seven times cheaper than Shin-Kori 5/6.

These prices are already out of date; systems in the US today cost less than $1/Wp.

&gt;95+% of the non-legal cost for base load plants like coal and nuclear is the fuel.

Nuclear fuel represents about 10% of the LCoE. [Typically 60% is the CAPEX payments](http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/economic-aspects/economics-of-nuclear-power.aspx).

&gt;&gt; [Opposition National Assembly President Juan Guaido greets supporters upon his arrival to the Venezuelan Central University for a conference on economic plans for reviving the country in Caracas, Venezuela, Thursday, Jan. 31, 2019.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Bolton’s comments come after opposition leader Juan Guaido said late Thursday that he would defy the government aid ban and receive large convoys of medicine into Venezuela with the help of neighboring nations.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Bolton tweeted on Friday: “Pursuant to the request of Interim President Juan Guaido, and in consultation with his officials the US will mobilize and transport humanitarian aid\_medicine, surgical supplies, and nutritional supplements for the people of Venezuela.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Venezuelan exiles who fled their homeland are telling U.S. Vice President Mike Pence that the moment has come to intervene and overthrow President Nicolas Maduro.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Pence told Venezuelans in Miami that Washington was working toward a “peaceful transition” so that opposition leader Juan Guaido comes to power, and he reassured them the Trump administration would continue to weaken Maduro.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; U.S. Vice President Mike Pence has arrived in Miami for a meeting with people who have fled Venezuela as Washington heightens its efforts to oust Nicolas Maduro from the presidency.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; A prominent Venezuelan lawmaker says that a group of European Union and Latin American countries aiming to solve the political crisis in Venezuela should support the ouster of President Nicolas Maduro without negotiations.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; “There is no possible discussion here, Maduro has to leave,” Sucre told The Associated Press on Friday in Madrid, where he is wrapping up a three-day European tour to enlist support for opposition leader Juan Guaido.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido says he’s respectfully declining offers from the presidents of Mexico and Uruguay to negotiate with President Nicolas Maduro.

_Steamed_Hams,1520384189.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_109jzthf,False,"A no-deal Brexit could quickly overwhelm Whitehall, the government has admitted in papers leaked to The Times.

A document drawn up as part of a contingency plan, codenamed Operation Yellowhammer, also says the government might have to go on emergency round-the-clock footing for months after a hard Brexit.

The immediate priorities in the event of no deal will be “welfare, health, transport and security of UK citizens at home and abroad, and the economic stability of the UK”, the document says.

It is a 37-page guide to working in the Department for Transport 24/7 operations centre. “The scale of the operation is potentially enormous. If there is no deal, the impacts could be felt [and] could fall across every transport mode [and possibly each sector within wider government], and could grow exponentially as . . . the capabilities of responders at all levels decrease or become overwhelmed,” it warns.

The government is worried about consequences they cannot foresee, it adds. “Critically, it has to be understood that . . . there will be issues of unanticipated impacts that arise, or impacts which had not been fully understood.”

There will be a series of 24/7 operation centres in the event of no deal which will report to the Cabinet Office. The centres go live from March 18 after a practice run on February 27 or 28.

The document says that the Department for Transport will not be able to cope with more than two emergencies at once. The Labour MP Owen Smith said: “This report lays out in brutal detail the impact of a no-deal Brexit: it’s an economic catastrophe, and the prime minister must rule it out as an option. It would damage our country for generations.”

Eloise Todd, chief executive of Best for Britain, said: “These documents are shocking and should be a wake-up call for MPs to take no-deal off the table.”

Theresa May is also being warned by Greg Clark, the business secretary, that she must secure approval for her Brexit deal in the next fortnight or millions of pounds worth of British exports may be stuck in “limbo-land”.

Ships going to the Far East take six weeks to arrive and must label their consignments before they go, so at present they will be travelling under the EU free-trade agreements.

If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, those agreements will fall and it is unclear what the status of the goods will be. Businesses might suddenly be liable for huge tariffs, or find them in quarantine for weeks. Mr Clark says this means that a deal must be agreed within two weeks, not by March 29, to avoid disaster.

• A majority of Britons oppose leaving the EU without a deal, with less than one in five saying that it would represent a good outcome. A new YouGov poll for The Times reveals that 51 per cent think a no-deal Brexit would be a bad outcome, 18 per cent think that it would be a good outcome and 17 per cent call it an “acceptable compromise”.",True,False,False,,0,1549128219,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",efloeol,True,t3_amg5rn,True,t3_amg5rn,/r/thenewcoldwar/comments/amg5rn/brexit_whitehall_wont_cope_with_nodeal/efloeol/,False,,1553438263,3,True,False,thenewcoldwar,t5_3i0a4,r/thenewcoldwar,public,,

That's why May's been leaving conferences etc over there early - she can't attend meetings to negotiate, since we're leaving.

I looked up your point on railways and found [this](http://theconversation.com/fact-check-do-new-eu-rules-make-it-impossible-to-renationalise-railways-61180), which I'll admit doesn't leave me convinced that staying in the EU would mean we couldn't nationalise our railways. The wording seems like it could be implied, but that would be a worst case scenario, and considering Germany's intervention to prevent nationalised railways being broken up, I doubt it would happen.

I should say, I acknowledge there are issues with the EU - nothing's perfect, and there are a lot of legit issues that could be raised. But Brexit's not really about that. I mean, the main issue that gets talked about by your everyman is immigration - which we were in charge of anyway.

MingauMatador,1546357217.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_2wi9vwfl,False,"Creio que o tempo seja mais do que o suficiente, se tiver alguém pra guiar. Claro que você não irá se tornar um mago da programação, mas acho que dá e sobra pra criar uma implementação que resolva o problema. Eu fiz algo parecido para o meu TCC, mas com plantas.

Por outro lado, acho que você também pode abordar o problema de outra forma sem ser machine learning. Pode tentar primeiro separar a íris da imagem, e depois analisar a distribuição de tons para classificação. Nesse caso, o mais esotérico seria a separação da íris, a classificação poderia se basear em métodos estatísticos comuns.

Eu conheço mais a fundo python, então para os dois casos recomendo a linguagem. Para o primeiro caso, sem machine learning, tenta usar as bibliotecas opencv e scikit-image. Como a íris parece ser uma das únicas coisas realmente redondas na imagem, não deve ser muito difícil separá-la. Olha a transformada de Hough para círculos, [tutorial nos docs do scikit](http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/edges/plot_circular_elliptical_hough_transform.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-edges-plot-circular-elliptical-hough-transform-py). Para saber qual método usar, temo que só testando mesmo. Depois disso, pode-se fazer uma análise estatística comum nos valores da íris, e.g., média, histograma, desvio padrão, etc. Creio que nessa parte você saiba mais do que eu! Pode-se também utilizar outros algoritmos de aprendizado de máquinas, não redes neurais, que funcionam bem para casos assim: kd-trees, uma SVM (Support-vector machines). Só precisa entrar com a íris e a classificação correspondente. Todas essas coisas já estão prontas, basta chamar a função e formatar os dados direito.

A solução via aprendizado de máquinas seria mais moderna e é por aí que as coisas estão se encaminhando. Nesse caso, busque criar uma CNN (rede neural convolucional) para analisar as imagens. Ainda, creio que você precisaria anotar a região da íris nas imagens, i.e., dizer que é essa a região importante para a classificação para a rede. Isso significa trabalho manual, mas não custa tanto tempo assim e é só pra treinar a rede. Eu já utilizei coisas como o Mask R-CNN e o YOLO, que são CNNs. Eles servem pra segmentar uma imagem em várias categorias. Não sei se são bons para o problema de classificação de imagens que você tem. Tenta procurar por algoritmos de classificação de imagens com CNNs ou redes neurais.

A resolução via machine learning talvez seja mais complicada. De novo, essas coisas já estão implementadas, o que dificulta é que as redes neurais tem um grau de abstração maior, que dificulta um pouco o entendimento rápido. Além disso, a rede requer mais recursos computacionais e demora mais pra treinar. 

Enfim, acho que se sente seguro com computação, vá com as redes, nem tanto pelo resultado, mas sim pelo aprendizado. Acho que os dois métodos retornarão resultados bastante similares.

There's more to piracy than first worlders are willing to understand or admit.

It is drawn from Tour of the Americas shows in the US in the summer of 1975, Tour of Europe shows in 1976 and performances from the El Mocambo nightclub concert venue in Toronto in 1977.

I don't think you really have to worry about the prices in Vienna, lol. You could do this on 1/3 of the amount ($100/day) while staying more than comfortable, in private rooms, eating out, etc. It would be a bit more modest in Germany and Austria, but still perfectly fine and doable. 

If you have the time, adding Amsterdam is totally possible, but it wouldn't be too sensible logistics-wise. Berlin-Prague-Vienna-Budapest is a more than established route, and adding Salzburg and possibly Krakow would be easy as well. 

I disagree about cutting Dresden, however you can check out the main attractions in a day. So leave Berlin early, stop in Dresden for sightseeing and take the last transport to Prague in the evening. Should be fine. 

Budapest is best done in 4 days, and Prague in 2 will only be enough for the usual sights - if you want off the beaten path, obscure museums, party a lot (and recuperate the next day), add a 3rd. Same for daytrips, Kutna Hora is a popular one. 

If you include Salzburg (and Hallstatt ofc), stay a night in Cesky Krumlov on your way there. And the Schladming-Dachstein area has lots of outdoor programs, hikes, ice caves, sky walk, suspension bridge and a superb cable car that takes you up to nearly 9000ft elevation. It could be a good day to mix up your urban-cultural itinerary. 

If you have the time, do add Krakow as well. With everything thrown in, Berlin (5) - Dresden (1) - Prague (3) - Cesky Krumlov (1) - Salzburg (1) + area (2) - Vienna (2-3) - Budapest (4) - Krakow (2-3), you would need about 3 weeks for this. $4k would still be excessive even if you do all this.

WeinerGmbh,1502897810.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_aqf0mjh,False,"1. Where I would get the most money (brutto - taxes - rent - food) ?

Both NL and Germany have pretty high taxes.
You can expect to pay 51% in the Netherlands and 42% in Germany. Germany additionally charges 5% solidarity surcharge, which is expected to be scrapped in the next years.

Berlin and Amsterdam are also very expensive cities. 

As a guide:
According to numbeo.com, living in Berlin for a single person is 780.74 € without rent.
Living in Amsterdam is 855.39 € without rent.

Decent one bedroom apartments for under 1000€ are rare in either city.

Keep in mind, that rents are predicted to rise in most major European cities.


2. Is it possible for a Junior UI/UX Designer to find a job in either Netherlands or Germany ?

The job prospects for web designers are decent.

For Amsterdam or Berlin in particular, they might be better than elsewhere, because these are both very young cities with tons of digital start-ups.

If you're fine with working for a start-up for a slightly lower salary, head to Berlin.
There is internet businesses everywhere!

If you want to try and get into the big players (like Netflix), Amsterdam has the big digital companies.
But don't assume you're going to get a job with them. The companies you mentioned are almost all very competitive.

Regarding university,
if you decide to opt for this option, then Germany is the cheaper choice.
Public universities don't charge international students at all.
Dutch universities are around 2000€ for EU students and range from around 5000€ to 20000€ for internationals.
Both countries' higher education is very reputable.


3. Which city is more friendly to expats, where it's easier to find friends ?

These are very international environments.
There are a lot of expats in both cities and it won't be harder to find friends than anywhere else.

As long as you participate in activities to meet people and make an effort, you'll be fine.


Both countries are very well developed, safe, educated and provide you with good future prospects.
It is really a question of personal preference.

Good luck!

&gt; LONDON: Britain would permanently regret leaving the European Union without a deal, and parliament needs to reach a decision to stop this in the next two weeks, business minister Greg Clark said in a newspaper interview on Saturday.

&gt; Britain is due to leave the EU on Mar 29, but lawmakers last month comprehensively rejected the exit deal Prime Minister Theresa May reached with Brussels, and Brussels this week turned down May&amp;#039;s request for renegotiation.

&gt; Without a deal Britain risked major disruption to trade with the EU, cutting British business out of pan-European supply chains, Clark warned.

Democracy isn't what's at stake, national sovereignty is.

Nevermind that imperial japan modeled their ideology and military on the british and the germans, but ""cultural genocide""? Okay? Surely you are not equating exterminating of entire people's with forcing people to learn japanese? Using your logic, we are committing cultural genocide since so many people are learning english.

&gt; You seem to be hellbent on that and mentioned Nazi Germany a few times as well,

Because germany is a european country and nazism is a european ideology and nazi germany is the purest form of the only original european idea ( racial genocide ).

&gt; Imperial Japan basically committed cultural genocide on the Koreans and tried to eliminate the Chinese as well because they believed they were racially/ethnically superior.

In other words they learned well from the europeans. Apparently not well enough since they didn't exterminate the koreans or chinese. 

&gt; I agree with you that the Mongols were somewhat better at assimilating than the European colonists in America, but this racial or ethnic superiority doesn't only pertain to Europeans.

Stop with your bullshit straw man. Of course everyone had a sense of superiority. The mongols felt themselves superior. So did the romans. So did the greeks. The difference between them and the europeans/nazis is that one decided the ""inferior"" deserved extermination. 

The mongols didn't say you are inferior and we are superior and therefore you don't deserve to exist like the europeans/nazis did. You certainly can understand that. And there is a difference between ""us japanese are superior and hence you should learn japanese"" vs ""us europeans are superior and hence you natives, aborigines, etc should be exterminated.""

&gt; Gorilla Biscuits is a New York straight edge hardcore punk band on Revelation Records. They formed in 1987. They picked the name under pressure to have a name when Token Entry got them a stage appearance unexpectedly. Ironically (due to their straight edge status), the name came from a big quaalude known as a ""gorilla biscuit"" which was popular in their neighborhood. The intent was to change the name later, but it stuck. However the name was used effectively in one of their early songs which is titled Biscuit Power with the lyrics ""Gorilla Biscuits in your fucking head, one more time and you'll be dead...""

&gt; Guitarist Walter Schreifels' later musical endeavors include Quicksand, Rival Schools, and Walking Concert. Frontman Civ became the singer for eponymic hardcore punk group CIV and is currently the owner of a New York City tattoo studio called Lotus Tattoos.

&gt; Gorilla Biscuits disbanded around 1991. They reformed for a benefit show at CBGB's, New York, in 1997 and August 14,2005.

&gt; They did a nationwide reunion tour in 2006, playing almost every song they wrote at every show. In 2007 they did a month-long European tour. Read more on Last.fm.

They have terrible security (80 million accounts were exposed last week)  
They have terrible customer service (just google it)

You can’t play games offline  
Limited social features  
No screenshots  
No controller support  
They broke EU laws (and still do)  
Scummy tactics (you had to tick a box to opt out of emails etc)  
They are partially owned by Tencent (a company that sells user data to the Chinese government)  
No achievements  
No cloud saves  
No game forums (many people went to steam for subnautica support)  
Epic make you pay the transaction fee when purchasing games (Like this)  
They are anti-consumer (They pay for exclusive rights to games to try and force you to use their store)  
They can refuse refunds even if you meet the criteria  
No reviews  
No Linux support  

Besides that, they just advertised steam on their retail boxes and announced the game for months to be available on steam and then pulling it out 3 weeks before release.  

No games library sorting  
No broadcasting  
No wish list (not that the Epic Store had many games to begin with, but still)

&gt; MOSCOW Russia has suspended the Cold War-era Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, President Vladimir Putin said on Saturday, after the United States said it would withdraw from the arms control pact, accusing Moscow of violations.

&gt; Trump has confirmed the U.S will leave an arms control treaty with Russia dating from the cold war that has kept nuclear missiles out of Europe for three decades.

&gt; During the meeting with Putin, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused the United States of violating the INF and other arms deals, including the non-proliferation treaty.

To impliment changes you first have to decide what youre doing and make those changes. Then you create a test build and test it yourself for any bugs. This takes a few days or until they are confident in how it performs. So lets give it a week.

Thats one week to even make the new patch. Next is certification. Sony requires about a week and thats split between Sony America, Sony Europe, and Sony Japan. All 3 are different companies that need to certify the game and its patch individually.

Xbox has the same thing only if you fail at any point during certification you start the whole process over again.

Its main message is that although automation causes unemployment by turning labour tasks into machine tasks, it might also ignite a mechanism that reduces unemployment. Automation requires rising wages, and that requires increasing the set of labour tasks. This increase reduces the rate of unemployment. Hence, automation leads to a continuing reduction in unemployment by its own adoption mechanism.

Imagine Trump in Russia. For the first couple of months its the biggest story in the world. He does interviews on Russian State TV, talking about how the Deep State caused him to flee the Country. Insisting he's still the President.

But then, slowly but as sure as the changing tide, fewer journalists are calling. Fewer requests for an interview. For a couple months he can still call up reporters and have what he says to them be newsworthy. But eventually they stop returning his calls. America and the world has moved on. He was a blip, a flash in the pan. He exposed deep wounds that the American people need to address. But he was a complication, not the original infection.

He's stuck in a golden prison of his own making. He lives next to Yanukovych. But Viktor, being Ukrainian knows the culture and the language. Trump is never able to master anything but the ability to mumble some words that border on the incomprehensible in the language. 

His days are spent in a unexceptional (in his eyes), dacha on the black sea. He's never far from the ever present sight of Russian Security Services. He lives off a modest Kremlin funded stipend. But domestic pressure is building on the United Russia Party to scale it back. He has no income of his own anymore. His assets are frozen and seized around the World.

His children are indicted. He didn't tell them of his plans to flee beforehand and they were as surprised as anyone. But, perhaps for the first time in their lives, Ivanka, Don Jr. and Eric feel the curious absence of a pressure they can't explain. At first they can't figure it out. They each face years in prison yet they have never felt more free. They confide in each other and they soon realize that the weight lifted from their souls is that of their father.

Free from his domineering presence they all plea to lesser charges. Putting the blame squarely on the narcissistic father whose ""Stockholm Syndrome"" like grip on them is slipping. They are sentenced. Don Jr. gets 18 months in Federal Prison. Ivanka and Jared are sentenced to staggered 12 month sentences. Eric cooperates fully and is not charged.

They are forbidden from contacting their father as part of their plea agreements. But they have no such desires. They don't care.

Melania files for divorce almost immediately after his flight. She gains full custody of Barron in uncontested hearings. Her and her son are slowly spending more and more time in Slovenia. Eventually they relocate permanently. Melania and Barron split their time between Ljubljana and the French Riviera. Very sparingly visiting the States anymore. Her autobiography detailing the mental, emotional, and at times physical abuse she suffered becomes an international best seller. Trump's American passport has long since been revoked and the Slovene Government, as well as the EU, bans him from entry into the Schengen Area. He never sees, much less talks to them, again

Trump becomes increasingly paranoid. He frequently tears his dacha apart looking for listening devices planted by Mossad, the Democrats, CIA, MI6 or whatever globalist conspiracy is hunting him this week. Soon he has no use for the teenage sex workers he has always fancied. Never having been a drinker, food becomes his only vice. He begins to put on weight. A lot of weight. As he slips into morbid obesity he nears 355 pounds. 

He very often rants and raves at his bodyguards. His tenuous grip on reality is slipping. Some days he doesn't seem to know where he is. He is borderline catatonic on occasion. Spending days in his bedroom suite without leaving, only to eventually emerge in a fresh, albeit cheap and ill-fitting, suit. His wispy hair, long kept alive by the marvels of modern hair care technology, perfectly coiffed. During these fleeting moments of seeming sanity, he doesn't seem to remember much of the last decades. Believing himself to still be a pompous fixture of the New York real estate scene. He once even asked his handlers how the New Jersey Generals were fairing this season. 

But within two or three days he is once again disheveled and ranting about the Deep State. His speech becoming more slurred and incomprehensible by the year. A series of strokes leaves his body partially paralyzed on one side. He now requires round the clock nursing. Incontinence soon follows.

Eventually he's found on the floor of his dacha, face down in a puddle of his own vomit. He is discovered by the morning nurse as she begins her shift. His breathing is slow, his heart rate is faint. He never again regains consciousness. He looks to have collapsed at some point in the night. During a mad, partially paralyzed slog to the bathroom in a vain attempt to avoid soiling his bed once again.

The official cause of death is a heart attack. Which is likely true but having outlived his usefulness, the Russian government has long since seen him as an embarrassing liability. His asylum has been a sticking point in relations with the West for years and conspiracy theories alleging his assassination at the hands of the FSB or CIA abound.

The Russians offer to repatriate his remains. Although his family, while not outright refusing, is lukewarm to the prospect. They have moved on. Barron and Tiffany don't even use his surname anymore. Unable to find a solution, the Russians bury him in a modest grave. It was originally planned to be temporary but a long term solution never comes to fruition. Before too long everyone has forgotten.

In death he remains infamous. His name uttered in the same breath as other embarrassing episodes of American History. Although more as the butt of ridicule and scorn. After all, it's not like he was even competent enough get the country into a real disaster such as Vietnam or the Iraq War. 

In US History textbooks he is relegated to a few paragraphs. Not more than half a page. He's brought up in conjunction with a wider discussion on the Political gridlock of the late 2000s, 2010s and early 20s. In the end, he is nothing more than the answer to a few multiple choice questions on an 11th Grade History Final. His legacy once seemed destined to be that of a pompous, arrogant game show host and real estate fraudster. Nothing but a textbook example of that which one would describe as ""tacky"". 

Now he is simply: ""What was the name of the President who's often xenophobic campaign and subsequent election highlighted the deep political divisions of the late 2010s?""

The answer is ""(C) Donald J. Trump""

Hace 20 años, el líder socialista Hugo Chávez tomó el poder en Venezuela y fundó la “revolución bolivariana”. Hoy, el país petrolero sufre una de las peores crisis política y socioeconómica de su historia, y aislamiento internacional, bajo el gobierno de su sucesor Nicolás Maduro.

Aquí los momentos más relevantes en estas dos décadas:1992 - 1999: Chávez al poder El 4 de febrero de 1992, el teniente coronel Hugo Chávez fracasa en un golpe de Estado contra el presidente Carlos Andrés Pérez, quien había impuesto un severo paquete económico y reprimido violentamente un estallido social. Tras dos años en prisión, Chávez es amnistiado y en diciembre de 1998 gana la presidencia. El 2 de febrero de 1999 se posesiona y convoca a una Asamblea Constituyente para crear una nueva Constitución que rebautiza al país como “República Bolivariana de Venezuela”.2000- 2002: El golpe de EstadoEn 2000, Chávez es reelegido en comicios convocados bajo la nueva Carta Magna. Su política de confiscaciones comienza a enfrentarlo con empresarios y trabajadores. El 2 de diciembre de 2000, la estatal petrolera PDVSA inició una huelga que buscaba sacarlo de la Presidencia, pero tras dos meses fracasa. El 11 de abril de 2002, una multitudinaria manifestación, convocada por empresarios y la mayor central de trabajadores, exige la renuncia de Chávez; se desvía al Palacio de Miraflores y tras un enfrentamiento que deja 19 muertos, el alto mando militar lo derroca y es encarcelado en un cuartel.  El empresario Pedro Carmona asume la presidencia y anula la Constitución, pero el 13 de abril Chávez es restituido por militares leales y la movilización de sus seguidores.2003 - 2013: Radicalización y muerte Tras lo que llamó el “golpe petrolero”, Chávez radicaliza la revolución. En 2004 gana un referendo revocatorio convocado en 2003 por la oposición, que en 2005 boicotea los comicios parlamentarios y los oficialistas toman el control del Congreso. En 2005 impulsa el 'Socialismo del siglo XXI'. Es reelegido en 2006, pero en 2007 pierde un referendo sobre una reforma constitucional que permitía la reelección indefinida. Ésta es finalmente aprobada en 2009 en una nueva consulta. Con la bonanza de los precios del petróleo, que llegaron en 2008 a USD 100 el barril, Chávez logró lealtades en países de América Latina e impulsó programas sociales. En 2011, el mandatario revela que tiene cáncer y se somete a tratamiento en Cuba. En octubre de 2012, es reelegido (2013-2019) , pero dos meses después unge como sucesor a Nicolás Maduro. Muere el 5 de marzo de 2013 a los 58 años.2013 - 2018: El gobierno turbulento de Maduro Maduro gana por estrecho margen al opositor Henrique Capriles las presidenciales en abril de 2013. En 2014, manifestaciones opositoras lideradas por Leopoldo López exigen la salida de Maduro, con saldo de 43 muertos. El opositor es encarcelado y condenado a casi 14 años de prisión. La economía cae en recesión. Se agrava la escasez de alimentos y medicinas. Los precios y la producción de petróleo -que genera 96% de los ingresos- se derrumban. En diciembre de 2015, la oposición asesta al chavismo la mayor derrota electoral al ganar la mayoría del Parlamento. Se desata un fuerte choque de poderes que dura hasta hoy. En 2016, el poder judicial, de línea oficialista, declara al Legislativo en desacato y nulas sus decisiones. Tras denuncias de quiebre democrático, Venezuela vivió cuatro meses de violentas protestas opositoras en 2017, que dejaron unos 125 muertos y que fueron desactivadas con la polémica elección de una Asamblea Constituyente oficialista y todopoderosa. La Constituyente, rechazada por parte de la comunidad internacional, adelantó las presidenciales a mayo de 2018. El 20 de ese mes, Maduro fue reelegido en unos comicios que la oposición boicoteó y denunció como fraudulentos, ante lo que varios países desconocieron los resultados.2019 - ...: Un gobierno desconocido El 10 de enero, Maduro asume un segundo mandato (2019-2025) considerado “ilegítimo” por Estados Unidos, la Unión Europea (UE) y una docena de países latinoamericanos. El 23 de enero, el jefe legislativo, el opositor Juan Guaidó, se autoproclama “presidente encargado”, invocando la Constitución y luego de que el Parlamento declarara a Maduro “usurpador”.  Reconocido por Estados Unidos y varios países de Latinoamérica, Guaidó lanza una ofensiva para lograr “un gobierno de transición y elecciones libres”. Maduro asegura que Guaidó es un “títere” de Washington en lo que denuncia como “un golpe de Estado en marcha”. Venezuela rompe relaciones con Estados Unidos, que le impone sanciones petroleras.

If you are a white skinned person (or perceived as such) and you go to places where white skinned persons are the other - typically nations in Africa and Asia - you will find the exact same thing. White skinned people are considered barbarians in many of those cultures, pointed at and called out.

CAIRO — Egyptian Minister of Endowments (Awqaf) [Mohamed Mokhtar Gomaa](http://www.shorouknews.com/news/view.aspx?cdate=20012019&amp;id=b9b469ee-909d-4bf3-82d8-cf98b87f15d1) inaugurated Jan. 20, on behalf of Prime Minister Mustafa Madbouly, the [International Awqaf Academy](https://www.elbalad.news/3653131) (IAA), a training institute for imams and preachers in 6th of October City in Giza governorate. The event was attended by Egyptian and international figures concerned with renewing Islamic discourse.

Gomaa said in his speech, “The IAA is a starting point toward moving forward with the call to renew Islamic discourse in order to face an intellectual stalemate and extremism.”

The IAA was built on an area of 11,000 square meters (2.7 acres) at a cost of [100 million Egyptian pounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QGIjy6W1PA) ($5.6 million), funded by the Ministry of Endowments and fitted with modern equipment and foreign language labs, so imams can communicate with those in the West, as well as computer labs.

Among the international figures attending the inauguration was Saudi Minister of Islamic Affairs Sheikh Abdul Latif al-Sheikh. Sheikh said during the ceremony that the IAA is a great [scientific foundation](http://www.youm7.com/story/2019/1/20/%D9%88%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%88%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%81-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B9%D9%88%D8%AF%D9%89-%D9%8A%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8-%D9%86%D8%B8%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%87-%D8%A8%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%AD%D9%8A%D8%AF-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%AC-%D8%AA%D8%AF%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%85%D9%84/4111107) to establish the correct understanding of religion, and that the [Saudi Institute of Imams and Preachers](https://www.moia.gov.sa/AboutMinistry/Agencies/Masjed/Pages/105.aspx) would launch training courses in cooperation with the IAA, although he did not specify whether these courses would be held in Saudi Arabia or Egypt.

Mohannad Khorshid, head of the [Center of Islamic Theology](http://www.uni-muenster.de/ZIT/en/) at Munster University in Germany, said during his speech at the inauguration, “This is a very important step in support of [Islamic enlightenment](http://www.elwatannews.com/news/details/3939528) sponsored by Egypt. It will help spread moderate religious ideology and renew religious discourse. The IAA will train a large number of scholars and preachers from Germany and Western European countries.”

Sheikh Jaber Tayeh, official spokesman for the Ministry of Endowments and head of the ministry's religious department, told Al-Monitor, “The IAA consists of a number of buildings equipped to train both male and female preachers from inside and outside Egypt. They are trained by scholars from Al-Azhar who are known for their knowledge and mediation skills in order to raise the intellectual level of imams and preachers. The opening of the academy comes as part of the Ministry of Endowments' efforts to renew religious discourse in Egypt, an issue raised by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.”

He said, “What is new about the IAA is that it offers a six-month experience for imams that includes intensive training through an enlightened scientific curriculum that offers a moderate vision for renewing religious discourse and providing a new vision that will enhance the way they confront extremism and terrorism.”

Tayeh added, “This experience is a first in Egypt since it lasts \[six months\], unlike the ministry's regular trainings that last for no more than a week. It also provides good contact with imams from outside Egypt.""

“When imams and preachers apply to the IAA, they are tested on their knowledge in religious sciences. After the imams are accepted, they are trained by university professors and experts in economy, politics and psychology,” Tayeh explained, noting that the training is comprehensive and not only limited to religion and imams are trained in different fields and taught foreign languages.",True,False,False,,0,1549149255,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",efmehek,True,t3_amjn4i,True,t3_amjn4i,/r/Egypt/comments/amjn4i/egypt_launches_international_academy_for/efmehek/,False,,1553450543,1,True,False,Egypt,t5_2ql2m,r/Egypt,public,,

1. It's just a forecast, but it is a prediction made based on the facts currently available to us in the present. Using the very successful scientific method with the facts available to us now, large-scale migration is very likely to happen in the future. Therefore we should try to take action preemptively, as that will be much less of a disaster than dealing with it when it very likely happens. 

2. Yes, because, while we are observing more extreme weather patterns across the globe, we have not yet experienced any mega disasters due to climate change.  The idea is, again, that we can predict these things will very likely happen in the future, based on current knowledge, and should take action now. For example, climate science predicts [massive flooding in the U.S. state of Florida by the end of this century](https://riskfinder.climatecentral.org/state/florida.us?comparisonType=county&amp;forecastType=NOAA2017_int_p50&amp;level=5&amp;unit=ft), rendering much of the state unlivable. Where will those people go?

3. Yes, several do. However, the vast, vast majority of climate science points to human causes. I could link many sources for this. Here is [one, that contains many others](https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/climate/faq/how-do-human-activities-contribute-to-climate-change-and-how-do-they-compare-with-natural-influences).  Here's [a website that is less hard science, but explains the scientific basis for the idea climate change is caused by greenhouse gas emissions, and therefore human activity](https://www.skepticalscience.com/empirical-evidence-for-global-warming.htm). Yes, it's true there have been times when the earth has been warmer (also much colder!), but those times were many, many thousands of years ago under very different geological circumstances. Without getting into the science of it, I offer as rebuttal [this xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1732/).

4. Stopping the use of fossil fuels would most certainly deeply hurt many developing countries. The unfortunate reality is that we have to work around this problem as best as we can, and leverage green energy sources to the fullest possible extent in those places. In my opinion, nuclear would do wonders in those places. The fact of the matter is slower economic growth is almost certainly better in the long term for any country than [the disastrous effects of climate change.](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-are-long-term-effects-climate-change-1?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products)

5. Climate change would have many more effects than clean water shortage. Even then, our desalination processes still aren't great, and they still [require lots and lots of energy to operate.](https://www.internationalwatersummit.com/__media/Energy-Efficient-Desalination-2018.pdf)

I don't want to sound condescending, /u/_Edu_, but I beg you to look at climate change from a factual standpoint. The magnitude of the problem is insane.

Decenas de miles de opositores venezolanos, liderados por el autoproclamado presidente interino, Juan Guaidó, marchan este sábado para exigir al mandatario Nicolás Maduro que abandone el poder, al mismo tiempo que otra gran manifestación de oficialistas celebra el 20 aniversario de gobierno chavista.

El inicio de la jornada de manifestaciones, que se desarrollan en todo el país, fue agitado por un video difundido en redes sociales en el que un general de Aviación de la Fuerza Armada desconoció a Maduro, convirtiéndose en el militar activo de mayor rango que reconoce a Guaidó.

""Usurpador vete ya"" y ""Fuera dictador"", ""Fuerza Armada oye al pueblo"", se leía en pancartas que portaban los opositores, que en Caracas se concentran frente a la sede de la Unión Europea (UE), en las Mercedes (este). ""Viva Guaidó"", gritaron cuando llegó el opositor a la tarima.

Guaidó, jefe del Parlamento de mayoría opositora que se autojuramentó el 23 de enero, convocó a la marcha para respaldar el ultimátum que dieron a Maduro Francia, España, Alemania, Reino Unido, Portugal y Holanda para que acepte ""elecciones libres"" o de lo contrario reconocerán a Guaidó.

""Marcho para recuperar la libertad, y sacar esta tiranía, esta narcodictadura"", dijo a AFP Beatriz Martínez, psicóloga de 75 años. ""Nos estamos muriendo de hambre"", manifestó Delia Rivas, de 52 años.

Otra multitud de oficialistas se concentra en la Avenida Bolívar, centro capitalino. Zaida, que se dice ""revolucionaria hasta los tuétanos"", explica: ""No me da la gana que esos malditos americanos se queden con las riquezas de Venezuela"", manifestó.

""Váyanse al carajo, yanquis de mierda"", se leía en una pancarta en la concentración, donde era esperado Maduro, quien en Twitter aseguró que ""el pueblo"" lo ""llena de fuerza para seguir por el camino"" trazado por el fallecido líder socialista Hugo Chávez (1999-2013).

El jueves, el Parlamento Europeo reconoció a Guaidó, presionando a la UE. Pero Maduro ha rechazado el ultimátum -que vence el domingo-, lamentando que la UE se ponga ""a la cola"" del gobierno de Donald Trump.

Las manifestaciones se desarrolaban bajo alta tensión: Disturbios dejaron la semana pasada unos 40 muertos y 850 detenidos, según la ONU, y en 2014 y 2017 dos oleadas de protestas se saldaron con al menos 200 fallecidos.

El 20° aniversario de la revolución se cumple en plena debacle del país: hiperinflación, escasez de comida y medicinas, y la petrolera PDVSA, en default y con una producción en caída libre, estrangulada ahora por sanciones de Estados Unidos, que no descarta una acción militar ni medinas adicionales.

El general Francisco Yánez, director de Planificación Estratégica de la Aviación Militar, aseguró que ""el 90% de la Fuerza Armada no está con el dictador, está con el pueblo"" y aseguró que la ""transición a la democracia es inminente"".

La cuenta de Twitter de la Aviación Militar colgó la foto de Yánez tachada con la palabra ""traidor"". ""Es un golpe duro para la FANB aunque no tenga comando"", dijo a la AFP la experta en asuntos militares Rocío San Miguel.

Yánez, quien dijo tener informes de que ""el dictador tiene todos los días dos aviones listos"" para huir, pidió a los militares no dar ""la espalda al pueblo"" y a los venezolanos marchar este jueves en apoyo al opositor.

Guaidó ofrece amnistía a los militares intentando quebrar el principal sostén del gobierno, la Fuerza Armada. El viernes, Maduro volvió a arengar a los soldados en un ejercicio militar: ""leales siempre, traidores nunca"".

""A los otros militares con los que hemos estado en contacto durante los últimos días, ha llegado el momento de que escriban sus nombres en las páginas de la historia de Venezuela. La historia los recordará como héroes a los que tomen la decisión de apoyar al pueblo"", dijo en un Twitter el senador estadounidense Marco Rubio.

Guaidó, de 35 años, se autojuramentó luego de que el Congreso declarara a Maduro ""usurpador"" tras asumir el 10 de enero un segundo mandato que considera ilegítimo -al igual que parte de la comunidad internacional- por resultar de comicios ""fraudulentos"".

Maduro, de 56, asegura contar con China y Rusia y ser víctima de un golpe de Estado en marcha, en el que Washington usa de ""títere"" al jefe parlamentario.

En declaraciones al South China Morning Post, Guaidó prometió cumplir los acuerdos y dialogar con China. Pekín indicó el viernes que coopera ""de forma pragmática"" con Venezuela y que ""nada de esto se verá afectado"" independientemente de como avance la situación.

Guaidó ofrece la llegada de ayuda humanitaria, acceso a servicios públicos -gravemente deteriorados-, freno a la hiperinflación, una nueva política monetaria y renegociación de la deuda externa, de unos 150.000 millones de dólares.

Maduro, que culpa a la derecha y a las sanciones estadounidenses de la crisis, rechaza la ayuda humanitaria asegurando que dan vía a una intervención militar y promete ""prosperidad"", aunque con el mismo modelo económico de control estatal.

Buscando una salida a la crisis, la UE creará un Grupo de Contacto de países europeos y latinoamericanos de ""90 días"" de duración, mientras que México y Uruguay convocaron a una conferencia con ""países neutrales"" el 7 de febrero en Montevideo.

Maduro llama reiteradamente a un diálogo, pero Guaidó insiste que sólo negociaría la salida del ""dictador"". (I)

Assuming this bag uses the standard rating system EN/ISO.  I’d have confidence in that comfort number. But checking the extreme rating is important as well.  If the extreme rating is close the comfort rating I’d agree with you.  However synthetic bags have really improved over the years.

I have a 900 g synthetic bag with a comfort rating at 0C and an extreme rating of -14C.  I’ve used it down to the extreme temperature and slept well with a lot of clothes.  My pad ended up being the weak point that night.

[John Holmes investigation](https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/244914/Report-in-response-to-complaints-concerning-four-Electoral-Commissioners.pdf):

&gt;Sir John Holmes gave a speech as Director of the Ditchley Foundation on 4 July 2016 at Chatham
House, the Royal Institute of International Affairs. The invitation to speak at Chatham House had
been accepted before Sir John Holmes became Chair of the Electoral Commission or had even
considered applying to be Chair of the Electoral Commission and although he had been
interviewed for the role before 4 July, it was far from certain that he would be successful in his
application.

&gt;5.5 **At that point Sir John Holmes had not been appointed and had not seen the Commissioners’ Code
of Conduct.** His speech is included in Appendix C. Whilst his personal views on the Referendum
result are stated, the thrust of his speech is on moving forward and working through the
consequences of the result of the Referendum. He made it clear that the views expressed were 
his personal views. It is improbable that, as a former British Ambassador in Paris, he would not
have a personal view on Europe and Brexit.

Order-order, quoting Brexit-central....oh dear, let's go deeper, shall we?

[Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/14/electoral-commission-misinterpreted-law-vote-leave-high-court)

&gt;The high court has ruled that the Electoral Commission misunderstood the law surrounding donations from the pro-Brexit group Vote Leave to Darren Grimes, the founder of BeLeave.

&gt;In a devastating judgment for the UK’s elections watchdog, the court found its interpretation of the law was inconsistent with both its language and purpose and said it had tried to draw a distinction that would be “a recipe for abuse of the spending restrictions”.

&gt;The Good Law Project, led by the barrister Jolyon Maugham QC, had sought a review of the commission’s decision to allow Vote Leave to donate to Grimes and not consider those funds to constitute its own spending.

Oh, the judgement was about the actions of Leavers?  That doesn't sound like a Remainer plot, it sounds more Like a Leaver plot.

GarbageDolly,1499312678.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_66nt6at,False,"The Spanish seemed to view “race” differently and also the duties of a parent were given more significance. 

Not acknowledging your child seemed to be worse than admitting you had an illegitimate kid with a non-white person. In the puritanical culture of Anglo America, having an affair was shameful and to be hidden, including any evidence of it, such as children. With Latin people, it’s more “I’m a human and I made a moral transgression but it would be far more shameful to not care for my offspring”. 

Also they almost had a reverse of the “one drop rule”. Anglo American culture seems to have had a purity obsession and being white had to be 100%. But the Spanish seemed to view having a Spanish ancestor as meaning you’re Spanish. There was possibly an idea of even “absorbing” the indigenous people. It’s my understanding that Argentina seriously attempted this. 

In contrast with something more comparable, black people in the US have a significant amount of European ancestry, yet they are identified with their African ancestry. Again, with Hispanics it’s opposite - they became identified with their Spanish ancestry instead of indigenous.

Also mixed African and white offspring generally weren’t acknowledged by the white parent. Not necessarily so with the Spanish. 

With the Spanish, the mixed children were more likely recognized. Records will show a Spaniard basically establishing a legitimate family in the “new world” even if he already had one in Spain. There were also many legitimate marriages or consensual mistress type relationships. And children might receive the father’s  name and perhaps even his land and whatever social status he had in the Americas.

Common sense not trusting too much ppl but at the same time don't be an asshole to people who genuinely want to help you as people can be generous too, especially in countries where your status is perceived as ""superior""
Had two bad things happen to me :
One was my fault because of drugs. I took MDMA and drank, got kicked out of a club in Romania and a Gipsy stole my phone and watch.
Chased this old guy and he pulled a knife.
I showed him I wasn't afraid but still I wasn't too aggressive cause scared people do crazy stuff.
I was actually shitting my pants but I needed the phone and the watch is precious. Gift from granddad who passed away.
He entered a house and I Got my stuff back after yelling for good 30 mins the police came and solved the situation.
So get high responsibly. You might get stabbed or shot.
And the second bad thing.. Was being almost kidnapped in a fake taxi. Story is too long, he just wanted more money for the fare and picked up another bigger guy inside the car without reason. When you find yourself in these situations you'll remember lots of things you studied, if you studied pnl, charisma things etc. 
Always keep your cool, thugs are like dogs they can small fear, but you can hide it somehow. Taxi incident Happened in Macedonia.

It was peak summer though, and in my experience using hostels its much cheaper so my guess would be around $3-5k USD. 

Spring is usually quite nice in Europe, the weather starts warming and activities start up with less crowds. There are also a number of festivals you could coordinate a trip around. May is when the crowds pick up and they don’t die down until around September, Europe’s heat also starts in mid-May and lasts until around mid-September (though nothing like Aussie heat). 

Travel within the Schengen zone is very easy and seamless, you’ll get a EU stamp in the first airport you enter when you land in Europe and it’ll last 90 days, when you leave a European border you’ll get your exit stamp. There’s no other visa checks or passport control anywhere in the Schengen zone. I remember crossing. From Austria to Hungary by train and once the train passed the border the Hungarian policy performed their passport control, that was the only time in a month in Europe my passport was checked. I believe Aussies have the same easy access as Americans, I pay no visa and don’t need to do anything ahead of time, I just show up to an EU airport and get my stamp. I believe you’ll be the same, but I’d double check. 

Leaving the Schengen May require a visa, I know turkey will need one that you an get online ahead of time for a few bucks and may still be able to get it at the airport in Turkey. England doesn’t require a visa but isn’t a part of Schengen, so it’s still easy and I don’t believe it starts your 90 days in the EU (but check). I think Eastern Europe may have visa requirements so you’d need to check country by country but it’s normal just a small fee and not anything to worry about.

cazzipropri,1524691375.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_zeb756f,False,"This answer assumes an implicit English questioner. 

This is how some of us feel.

&amp;#x200B;

**1) You were never truly part of the EU.**  

Too many opt-outs.  You didn't want to use the same currency as everybody else.  You opted out of the Schengen treaty.  You fucking opted out of the  Charter of Fundamental Rights (who does that?!).  Honestly, if you are in a group of supposed peers, and you constantly want special treatment, don't be surprised if you are not popular.  Now you want out completely: what a surprise!  And that makes all those who kept saying that you'd be a saboteur and that we shouldn't have let you in in the first place come back with an ""I told you so"".

&amp;#x200B;

**2) You think you are better than us.**

This is truly, truly, truly, the fundamental reason at the core of Brexit, and the fundamental reason why we won't miss you.

The European Union is a very long term project for brotherhood, peace and cooperation among the people of Europe. You don't believe you are a peer in this brotherhood.

Should we remind ourselves that you fucking requested an opt out of the ""ever closer union"" clause of the Solemn Declaration of the European Union?  That's a purely philosophical and completely practically inconsequential document. Who does that?

So, as I would say to an abusive girlfriend, if you think you are better than me, just dump me and move to people who deserve you. If you are right, go ahead, you deserve to be with better people than me. If you are wrong, go ahead, I deserve to be with people who don't think they are stooping down to my level.

&amp;#x200B;

**3) You are too proud to be part of something bigger than you that you are not ruling.**

You are stuck in an imperial past delusion of grandeur.

Of course, the head nation of an empire that spans the five continents doesn't have to stoop entering a customs unions where she can only negotiate trade deals collectively.

The proof is that your politicians keep selling you repeatedly the delusional promise that you could go around the world and negotiate better trade deals that you could have gotten via the EU. 

Attentive news readers are already seeing today how ridiculous that delusion is. After March 29, your entire country will feel how grotesquely insane that delusion is.

&amp;#x200B;

In summary, our feelings are that you are a problematic member, that you are ridden by devastating internal divisions that we fear could infect us; for that reason, we hope you leave soon, before contagion occurs. 

We have little or no sympathy for the reasons that impelled you away from us, and we believe that we can make more progress with needed EU reforms once you are out. 

We are eager to build and improve a number of EU structures (common border defense, common military, different ECB mandates, ...) that we couldn't do with you around. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, please GTFO and good luck.

Expecially for people in scotland who have been literally dragged into this by their feet. if i could roll back time just for them i would.  
- i feel sad for the people in europe that had ties with the uk and will be affected by this, money loss, job loss, opportunities loss, families broken.  
- i feel angry, cause reality is not a fair place, so i'm aware some really good people will get screwed badly, people who voted remain will lose their jobs or will see their families destroied, while there will be people who caused this and deserved all the bad coming that will be able even to profit from it, i hate when karma doesn't strike.
- i feel sad cause i respect what the UK represent for europe, their history and their culture, it's like when a main character leaves a tv show, the shows goes on but from then on it's not the same thing.  
- i feel scared cause i can totally see this happening in any other country including mine cause no matter where you live the dumbasses always outnumber the smart people, people are so gullable and easily impressionable and social sciences are figuring out how to do that more efficiently, so basically any nation where people are unhappy could be lead into disaster by a Pied Piper playing the right tune and people are figuring out how to tune the fiddle properly.  
- i feel angry cause i see the direction the world is going and i think countries should stick togheter instead of separate, a large unite union is stronger than a divided one and losing a big chunk like the UK is not good for anybody.  
- i feel grateful cause it's like UK is taking one for the team, this had the potential to destroy europe but it looks like europe is coming out stronger than expected from this, and the more uk fucks up the more EU looks good, looks like all far right movement screaming about leaving the EU have lowered their voices on the subject recently.

have you check if these things are true, your grandmothers might tell you a different story,
I have read similar stories to yours and years later they found out their parents were given a house etc,


why did they have to give money to their sibling to go through college,
have you asked their sibling if that is true, their sibling might lie, (in either direction)
or not remember but it would be interesting to know the truth, shouldn't their sibling been able to support themselves financially back then, why did they need your parent's help?
(I have studied a lot of maths, this statement is mathematical untrue, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table )

GenX says such things really?
not in the west, here it is baby boomers, GenX got screwed
for example my older brother is 40 years old and is broke, he only has one 3 year old son,
(brother has two university degrees,), he is consider young to have kids,
most women put of having kids until they are 30 years old, (IVF is very common)

A lot of GenX has decided not to have kids because they can afford them.

It is considered irresponsible for a man under 40 to have kids, due to a lack of financial stability,
Child Protective Services, regularly take children away from younger parents,
your parents would be in the prime earning age in the west,

how young were your parents when they had you?

GenX has very high levels of debt and unemployment in the west, maybe your parents are finding in hard to get work?

All Countries are trying to get their workers to retire at 75 years old, no one has retired at 40 years old for
over a 100 years, in fact, I am not sure if there has been any point in history were retirement was 40 years old, 

It the west the boomer generation was the most blessed, (for last 300 years, according to peer reviewed research) maybe there is a delay in third world countries,

GenX can bearably hold a job in the west, and baby boomers are just thinking about retiring,
maybe, they might not,

Most 40 years old in the west are just starting their careers and families,
what you are describing is the way the 60 &amp; 70 years old complain in the west,

My wife and I went 2 years ago for our 25th anniversary and we stayed at Caribbean Beach resort. It was the first time we'd ever gone to Disney and stayed at a Disney resort. Now we won't do it any other way.

In fact, we're heading back Mar 2 and are booked there again. You get the perks of being on Disney property so there is proximity to the parks. There's transportation to and from the parks. There's the Magical Express, picking you up right at the airport and taking you to the resort. There's your luggage being picked up at the airport for you and delivered straight to your room. There's the online checkin before you ever get there.

There's out of park entertainment like pools. Bike rentals. Movie nights. Walking paths. Beaches. Kid events.

There's the earlier access for FastPass+ reservations. There's the earlier access to make dining reservations (Is it earlier for dining reservations? I was told it was, but not sure on that one).

There's the access to Extra Magic Hours if they have those on the day you choose that park ([https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/en-eu/calendars/month/2019-02-02/](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/en-eu/calendars/month/2019-02-02/)).

Concierge's to make things easier when you need a hand. MagicBands being linked to your room info, and any charges for souvenirs being simplly added to your room charges. Purchases in the parks being able to be sent to your resort so you aren't carrying them around.

Precisely because her past behaviour demonstrates that sex isn't something that requires ""cultivated experience and feelings"" for her. This is the part you may be missing: this isn't a girl who makes \*all\* guys wait - or rather to use different language, this isn't a girl who waits with all guys so that she can cultivate experiences and feelings.

Ryexandra,1549054543.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_34rsabdh,False,"I'm sorry, but I have a few large problems with this whole list of suggestions. So I'd like to add my two cents. 

&gt; Cut down on meat it will make you put on weight mostly in visceral fat making you more likely to die of a heart attack when your metabolism slows down on hrt, 

All calories are broken down to base glucose before they are stored via the insulin responce as fat where ever that energy can be. You don't gain spesfic types of fat from diet just like you can't target spesfic fat with exercise. If you data that says otherwise I'd really like to see it, this would be real news as far as I know. 

Also metabolism doesn't just slow down on HRT. Your base metabolic rate can drop due to loss of muscle mass (muscle requires more calories to maintain ). But nothing about HRT directly effects the calories consumed my your body. Might seem nitpick y but it's an important distinction. 

Also also, protiens are a more stable calorie source than starches or carbohydrates like grain. They also carry import amino acids and are the Primary source of iron for most people. It's certainly true most people could stand to cut back though. Meat is caloricly dense so you have to keep that in mind to maintain your body weight. 

&gt;Decrease your grains to mostly Barley, flaxseed, hops, oats, wheat germ, and WHOLE grains any type of flour is a no go, 
&gt;
  
I think you might be missing a punctuation mark here? Not really all that clear. But in general outside of a higher dietary fiber content there is no real benift to flours over whole grains. Some spesfic grains can have higher protein content like oats and flaxseed though. The real ""danger"" of processed grains is that they have smaller hydrocarbons and are thus closer to glucose and thus can be processed down faster meaning your blood sugar spikes higher and faster. 

&gt;Reduce added sugar intake to 35 grams a day,
&gt;
  
Good advice in general, 35 grams is about 1 12 once can of soda. Added sugar comes in a lot of forms and is the main cause of excess caloric intake and high blood sugar levels. 
Just keep in mind that there is no difference between added sugar and sugar not added but still present. 


&gt;Eat vegetables but avoid broccoli, mushrooms, garlic, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, kale, and turnips they increase testosteron, increase lima beans, peas, alfalfa, carrots, spinach, cucumber, and beets, 
&gt;

  
The ability of spesfic diets to modify the balance of the endocrine system is laughable at best. I feel that spreading this kind of half truth is harmful because it can make people feel guilty or scared that their spesfic choice of food Wil damage their transition. 


&gt;Don’t eat beans, focus on other legumes like chickpeas, edamame, soy products like tofu, and lentils, 
&gt;
  
Same as the last one the the added point that plant estrogen like those present in soy have little to no effect on the human body


&gt;Increase your intake of fruit like tomatoes, avocado, pomegranate, lemon, oranges, grapefruits, grapes,apples, and persimmons, 
&gt;
  
  While this can seem like good advice on the surface, and humans should consume fruit as part of a balenced diet for all the nutrients it contains the higher fructose intake leads to higher blood sugar levels too, all things in balance.  

&gt;Eat starches like yams and potatoes, avoid pasta, bread, and crackers, 
&gt;
  Starches are the next closest common hydrocarbon to the base sugars. Same problem as above. It's about total caloric intake and not spiking the blood sugar too high. Eat a balenced diet with not too many starches and sugars. 

&gt;Don’t eat dairy because it will make it harder for your body to absorb the estrogen in the foods, 
&gt;  
  
The bio availablity of estrogens through the digestive system is already abismal and plant estrogen doesn't work like peracribed estrogen anyway. There is a reason they peracribe estrogen pill sublingualy or subbuccaly. Partly because the bio availablity is bad and partly because it's hard on the liver.  

The larger problem with dairy is lactose and the inability of adults who haven't inherited the mutation norther Europeans developed to process it. That can cause everything from simple intestinal discomfort to more serious symptoms. That and lactose is a simple sugar. 

Dary products are also tipicaly very caloricly dens so it's a good idea to not eat to many lest you loose track of your intake. 

&gt;Don’t eat oil becausec it’s stupid and makes you fat because it’s taking the worst part of an otherwise healthy food, fry your food in water, 
&gt;  

This is the most patently false thing here. Fats and oils do not make you fat. In fact they are the *best* calories you can consume. Huge hydrocarbon chains like thouse that make up the lipid class take a long time to break down keeping your blood sugar stable.  They can also bind to and carry large amounts of protiens and amino acids. 

But they are also the highest density of calories. You have to be careful not to use too much. One tablespoon can be over 100 calories 

&gt;Don’t eat almonds or Brazil nuts they increase testosterone, 
&gt;

Same points as above about increasing T. Nuts are also a great source of nutrition and stable calories 

&gt;If you drink tea don’t drink green tea it increases testosterone, 
&gt;  

False 

&gt;Drink coffee, 
&gt;
  
Coffee has a lot of its own problems, namely the longterm effects of caffeine on the cardio system. 


&gt;increase licorice consumption, 
&gt;  

I don't actually know anything about the nutrition of licorice  but I do hope you mean the spice not the candy people tipicaly associate it with. 


&gt;And no matter what remember you are beautiful. Sp
&gt;  

Great advice, I can always use more support, thank you &lt;3

The entire World War II had less landmines than was used in Moçambique, even the actual Moz defense minister admits about 3 MILLION are STILL undiscovered. Even Europe, during world war 2, did not have “mines planted around Mozambican schools, police stations, and other government buildings”. Respected investigative [journalists and researchers](https://events.barcelonagse.eu/live/files/1476-papaioannoupdf) have had this to say:  
  
Mines **manufactured in 15 different countries** were used by all sides in the fighting, accelerating a devastating famine cycle in the 1980s that sent a huge refugee exodus across the borders with South Africa, Zambia, Tanzania and Malawi. According to Handicap International, an estimated 20 people step on landmines **every month** in Mozambique. Sixty percent of them die because they lack access to health services. In 1996, Mozambique’s Defense Minister estimated that there were **still about 3 million landmines** in Mozambique.  
The devastation caused by mines in Mozambique is striking. In addition to farmable land, power lines, roads, bridges, railroads, and airports, even schools, factories and cattle dip tanks were mined. Wildlife is also threatened by mines: elephants have been found maimed by anti-personnel mines and killed by anti-tank mines. The average life expectancy in Mozambique is about 46 years.

That’s about one person stepping on a freaking landmine **every single day, all yearlong, every year** (2/3 die). This *alone* is greater than the New Jersey murder rate (where people live twice as long). This is not normal bro  
  
That [picture](https://www.catholicireland.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Landmine-victims.jpg) is from another recent Ottawa convention in Maputo, the topic of the conference was about: “anti-personnel mines”; even the [pope](https://www.ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/pope-francis-calls-landmines-weapons-cowards) mentions the “unnecessary new Mozambique landmine victims” every year.

It is very scary atm, if you begin to sink in your personal life with a Tory government then you're going to keep sinking. Under a Labour government prospects would not be so scary. I don't think our society was on track, and that was since long before Brexit.

Corbyn has been tongue-tied over the EU and with some justification. I don't think anyone can claim his policies have been interrogated evenly in the press. I regret that some dedicated Leftists have not carved out a better space to discuss 'Lexit' if only for the simple reason that no-deal Brexit is a possibility we literally might have to face. The EU is ok for the poorer and disadvantaged compared to a libertarian Brexit but only in a crumbs-from-the-table kind of way.

If we can exorcise the financial sector from its dominant but undeserved position at the apex of our economy I think some new light will be shed on other ways of going about things.

I really don’t think there’s any way out of this. The deal is not up for renegotiation. The chances of an extension of article 50 looks slim and even if a 2nd referendum were to happen and even if remain won the far right in Britain will go insane. If Britain does cancel the whole thing and pretends it never happened the EU can still (and has every right to) punish the UK and make them an example to other countries considering leaving too.

I do believe that if Britain crashes out with nothing then it’s almost a guarantee that Northern Ireland and Scotland will leave the UK by the next 10 years (possibly even less).

Almost all of your politicians are useless. May is incompetent. Corbyn is just as incompetent. UKIP are still a load of wankers but at least they actually have a consistent policy on brexit. The DUP are so incompetent that they’ve done more to assist the Republican cause than Sinn Fein have achieved in the last four decades. The only people speaking actual sense are the SNP, Lib Dems and the backbenches of Labour (which won’t matter as long as Corbyn is still the leader of the party)

QUEEN Elizabeth II has called on the British Army to storm Number 10 Downing Street this evening in a bid to relieve current Prime Minister Theresa May and her staff of their duties, WWN has learned.

In an unprecedented move which will no doubt change the face of British politics forever, the Queen has insisted that she will now take care of Brexit negotiations with the European Union, the DUP and the Republic of Ireland.

In case you don't know, Missions Expanded is a mod that adds more mission trees to the game. To be more exact, over 240.

Our work also includes:

The main thing keeping people from developing modern rifles sooner in real life wasn't that people didn't know how the rifles would have worked. Just didn't have the materials to do it or the tools to do it. Technological advancement is often just finding ways to use tools to make better tools, rather than discovering new ideas about how things work. The Industrial Revolution wasn't generally people figuring out that stuff was possible, it was mostly people figuring out ways to do stuff cheaply and easily enough to be worthwhile.

A basic muzzleloader like you might find in a regiment of State Troops (or in the armies devastating Germany in the 1630's) doesn't need many moving parts. The internals of cartridge repeaters, whether they're revolvers or machine guns, are a lot more complicated, even fairly simple designs like the Sten or Kalashnikov. Assuming that Nuln is like 1600's Europe in technology, it probably doesn't have access to good enough steel as cheaply as necessary for this. Metal also needs to be cheap in order for the brass/steel/whatever casing not to be prohibitively expensive. Interchangeable standardized parts are necessary if you don't want to have a guy with watchmaker-level skills look at it every time it's not working right. Even if you're not talking about something that needs precise lathe/mill-work, machine tools are still quite useful, particularly stamping machines.

The other issue is smokeless powder. Black powder burns slower, so it doesn't get the projectile going as fast. You can see the transition from black to smokeless powder just by looking at the kinds of bullets armies used. They went from big, heavy bullets to small, fast bullets which carry at least as much energy and don't slow down as fast. Additionally, black powder weapons need much more cleaning than smokeless powder weapons in order to function properly.

The Sten was designed to be simple enough that village blacksmiths could make it because the British were desperate for equipment after having lost so much at Dunkirk. Sure, it could be made a lot easier with machine tools, but at it's core, it's just a pipe, a spring, and bits of stamped metal. Stamping is basically just a giant machine that hammers out a pattern all at once, rather than a blacksmith hammering out that pattern over a longer period of time.

TLDR: Nuln could very easily figure out how it works. The biggest question is if they know how to make smokeless powder. If not, they would have trouble keeping the moving parts from getting too dirty to function (bolt-action rifles being the most complicated things that could be plausible with black powder). Either way, they have  enough the metalworking expertise necessary for the simplest of modern firearms, at the very least. They just don't necessarily have the metallurgy required for it to be cheap enough to be worthwhile, almost definitely not the standardized parts for it to be affordable, and machine tools are even less likely. Their technology is roughly equivalent to Europe several decades before those things started to become widespread (the coke-fired blast furnace and interchangeable parts being 1700's, machine tools, late 1700's/early 1800's, smokeless powder late, 1800's).

TLDR of TLDR: Nuln could reverse-engineer it easily. Making more of them and ammunition is harder but still probably possible. Nuln probably doesn't have the technology to do it cheaply enough to be worthwhile.",True,False,False,,0,1549193046,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",efnhm7g,False,t3_amo981,False,t3_amo981,/r/WarhammerFantasy/comments/amo981/if_you_were_to_drop_a_semimodern_rifle_into_the/efnhm7g/,False,,1553468810,32,True,False,WarhammerFantasy,t5_2rv4g,r/WarhammerFantasy,public,,

Title: **(European Citizent) I've pre-paid for an NVIDIA GPU that requires up to 10 working days to be delivered. After the deadline expired and them holding on to my money, they want to offer a refund, due to lack of stock (while still listing/selling the product at an increased price till this day)**

Original Post: 

&gt; Hello, I am a European Citizent and I bought an Nvidia GPU from a Greek Website, that I found to be a verified Business, on a search engine, that lists various shops with the best prices for an item you search in it.
&gt; - Specifically, this website/shop I made my order from, in all of their products, requires that you deposite the money through a Bank, before the deadline for the item's arrival begins to count.
&gt; 
&gt; - They only sell products through bank deposits.
&gt; 
&gt; -  They state, that they need 4-10 working days to receive the product in their warehouse, from their suppliers and up to 4 working days to deliver it to my address. Total 14 working days(3 weeks).
&gt; 
&gt; - They have the lowest prices on PC electronics compared to their competitors(I bought my GPU for 480 Euros, their nearest competitor sells that exact same GPU for 550 Euros)
&gt; 
&gt; - This is a new store/website(only been around for 6 months) and as can be seen from half of their reviews, they have a pattern of holding on to people's money from their deposites, up to a month's time, only to send their money back after that time period, using excuses as apologies in their review section, such as:
&gt; 
&gt; ""We are sorry we made an error and recieved a wrong product from our supplier, it's gonna take us 2 weeks for the next shipment, since it arrives by truck""
&gt; 
&gt; ""We are sorry for the delays, our supplier's product arrived damaged."" The person who made this order, waited 2-3 months to get his money back, they gave have him 3 excuses that all 3 times the product kept arriving damaged. One time that consumer knew he was getting scammed and demanded that they send the package damaged and they replied with the excuse ""Well as soon as we see that it's damaged, we send it back to our supplier, so we can't do that.""
&gt; 
&gt; ________________________________________________
&gt; 
&gt; **So Here is my particular Case with this store:**
&gt; 
&gt; - I made my order  ~20th of January. My Order's details were:""Waiting for payment"" After 1 day, I went to the bank to deposite my money and contacted them to let them know that I had paid, so that they make my order and for the deadline to begin to count, as a explained in their Terms Of Service. My order's details changed to ""Processesing"", which under their TOS, means they had received my money and they had ordered from their supplier.
&gt; 
&gt; - After 3 days of me making my order at 400€, they increased the product's price to 430€ ( Their competitors still had that product more expensive, at 450€) . So any new customers, would pay 30€ for  the same product I had closed the deal at 400€ with the store.
&gt; 
&gt; - After 7 working days of me having paid  them, I contacted them Past Thursday, by phone, to ask an update on my order, since it was still under ""Processing"" and I was wondering what was happening with it. Immidietly their representative came back on the phone and said ""We are terribly sorry, but we had an influx of those orders and our supplier is out of stock, so we will be issuing an immidiete refund this Monday."" I told them, ""I never said anything about cancelling my order, you still have 7 working days to figure out my order, I just called to ask for an update, considering you are out of stock, I should have my refund issued right now, not 5 days later."" So they replied with ""Okay then, we'll see if there is anything we can do.""
&gt; 
&gt; - After that phone called, I checked in their reviews and saw the excuses they made, to half of their customers who gave them a 1/5 star rating, they kept delaying the refunds, so there is this pattern this company seems to be following, of withholding people's deposites and then refunding them a month later, without providng them with the product.
&gt; 
&gt; - **Here is the biggest Issue:** Under their Reviews, a new review had showed up! That review was of a person giving them 5 stars, for receiving a GPU, with the increased price of 430€ in under 3 days! 
&gt; 
&gt; So to my understanding, they used my 400€, they ordered the GPU From their supplier, then they increased the price and the new consumers who bought the GPUs at 430€ are the ones getting the delivery, because they paid them more, while those of us who gave them money first, are getting refunds, since they want to sell it for a bigger profit. 
&gt; 
&gt; Are they allowed to do that? Isn't that considered a scam? What Can I Do legally, considering tommorow I'll call them, they will either offer a refund or give me an excuse and delay it by 1-2 more weeks. I am already 2 weeks without a GPU and will possibly be for up to 1 Month. Aren't I protected by the consumer's rights under the European Union's laws? This company has a pattern of holding on to people's money for a month and then simply returning them, after holding on to them for a full month!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;

OutrageousCoat,1540243742.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_2gkgjg23,False,"First  and foremost, the RP-PVE servers are (or were) populated by a majority  of roleplayers until wrath - before then it was a very pleasant villiage  atmosphere. Out of character talk in any public channels (/s /y /e) was  a big no, you got blacklisted, you could even get told off by GMs if  you did it repeatedly and banned for it. Very slowly since mid-wrath  people started coming to roleplay servers but refused to integrate. They  refused to roleplay and they refused to engage with anyone except to  troll, use them as a joke, or a spa. They treated the server like comfy  background noise and abused the good nature of the community. (Blizzard  scrapped most RP realm rules around WoD but the GMs stopped interacting  and caring around mid wrath so you can imagine how it escalated)

As  the game went down hill this became an increasing trend. After about  mid wrath normies started coming to the realm to abuse it, sites like  darknest started to get big and you had lots of people who had never  roleplayed, didn't care about the community or ever contributing,  transferring over to use places like Goldshire as hotspots for the  roleplay that reads like it was written by someone that has trouble  recognizing themselves in the mirror. With the only intention of giving  the thinly veiled guise that they were RPing.. but rather were actually  self inserting to ERP out fantasies. Before wrath Goldshire was a sleepy  town on AD EU with a host of characters that wouldn't be out of place  tolkien's fictional town Bree.

Over  time the people that actually made the servers what they were got fed  up trying to make a difference, the game's quality was declining, GMs  didn't care, things became unmanagable, the lore was getting fucked,  they left. Very slowly roleplayers were replaced by people that had no  intention of continuing the culture or contributing but were happy leech  the social the benefits the server provided.. for a while. RP realms  aren't even a shadow of what they once were, the difference is  indescribable. As more of the old guard left the quality decreased, the  community dwindled, until you have what we have today.

A  minority of roleplayers that are outnumbered by people who don't have a  basic grasp, or understanding of the fundamentals and refuse to learn,  take advice, or improve themselves. They come to the server to use what  little remains of the community as background noise for ""immersion""  sexual fantasies, or w/e and then screech when they're called out on it.

As  for RP itself, no it doesn't affect your progress, plenty of roleplayers have ranked to 14 or raided  regularly. They just had enough respect to be OOC when it was  appropiate. (not around people roleplaying, not around populated areas,  not around roleplaying hotspots, avoiding OOC chat in public channels s/  y/ /e)

tea_hottea,1364401188.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_b3fl6,False,"I work in an international school with teens from all over the world.  It never ceases to amaze me the similarities in developmental norms that occur in students who come from completely opposite sides of the globe.  A grade 9 girl is a grade 9 girl whether she's from Vietnam, America, a country in Europe or a country in Africa.  

Anyhow, one thing I learned is that teens need to feel heard and understood.  Power trips DO NOT work with teens and although a hierarchy is there because I'm their counselor, it helps to remind them that I was a teen once too and I probably can pull from my own experience and empathize with whatever they're going through.  

Listening skills are everything.  And ask open-ended, through provoking questions.  Their minds are at such a wonderful phase in terms of their development.  As a counselor for teens, I have a special privilege to gently shape or soften the edges when they come in and they're in a rage over something.  I help to validate their feelings and I show them immense amounts of respect.

Also, I build rapport.  Sometimes that means asking about the music they listen to or find out more about their hobbies, etc.  I swear in front of them (not profusely - just if it fits).  Dropping a cuss word can go a long way in making you appear more human.  I'm not advocating for it, however, if it's something that isn't comfortable for you.  I'm not proud of my potty mouth, but it does work when I need it to.

I ask them to set boundaries for themselves.  I ask them to envision what feeling better would like like.  What would need to change?  We talk about wanting to be treated like an adult but still acting like a child.  Change in teens can be swift if you take a very supportive approach.  I never use discipline, ever.

So hunters say they have to hunt, otherwise these animals will damage crops and run onto highways. But there's also a long standing tradition for hunters to build little feeding huts in the woods, where they take grains and hay all winter long (outside of hunting season) to ensure enough deer and boars survive over the winter that they would be able to hunt them again next year. If they were really concerned about protecting the crops and keeping populations down, they obviously wouldn't give the animals extra food to help them survive in the winter.

For the highway crashes argument, well, it's true that there are thousands of car accidents involving deer and moose every year in my country. But 90% of people don't adhere to the speed limit. Not to mention that everyone is taught in driving school that if it's dark, or slippery, or foggy, then even the speed limit is often too much and you should slow down even more. As long as 90% of people are driving like idiots, I don't think they should be complaining when they get into accidents. And I don't think the solution here is removing the animals...

1. UK agricultural exporters will face potentially even higher tariffs, such as 42% on cheddar cheese. Our access to the lower tariff rate quotas is uncertain, without which many agricultural exports will be incompetitive
1. There will also be extensive checks on EU agricultural exports to the EU, which will further add costs, and there will not be veterinary equivalence schemes in place to facilitate these 
1. UK service providers will not have the right to sell certain services across the EU, particularly direct from the UK. In many cases they will have to set up new offices in the EU
1. Many UK based staff will not have the right to work across the EU, for example as tour reps for UK travel companies. EU citizens would have to take these roles
1. UK haulage companies would not be able to carry loads between EU destinations, and could for the short term only carry from UK to an EU destination and return. This will make them uncompetitive to EU hauliers 
1. The tariffs on goods, and restrictions on services, will also apply to countries with who the EU has a current trade agreement that the UK fails to replicate - for example there is likely to be no agreement with Turkey
1. In no-deal Brexit there will be no agreement with the EU on data adequacy or financial services equivalence. This will mean extra cost for all UK companies who move data between UK and EU for example
1. The UK Government will have to decide on whether to keep or reduce our own tariffs. This will not be an easy decision - lower tariffs may help consumers but harm UK producers and developing countries who currently get particular privileges 
1. Over 50% of UK trade will be affected by these changes. Less than 10% of EU trade will be affected by these changes. UK costs will rise, EU costs are unlikely to do so. This will be a major change to the terms of trade between us 
1. These issues are why even no-deal advocates talk of 'managed no-deal', or a deal with the EU. But if all of this is going to affect the UK more than the EU there is no reason for the EU to offer a more generous deal than that on offer now 
1. All of these are the sort of issues which are typically resolved in a free trade agreement. But these take time, typically in the EU 5-7 years. Waiting this time would mean all of these issues being maintained, affecting UK competitiveness
1. Some no-deal advocates claim the UK could gain competitiveness by scrapping EU regulations, however it would be difficult then to negotiate a trade deal with the EU at the same time. 
1. The UK is expecting to start Free Trade Agreement negotiations with US and others in a no-deal situation. However if the UK economy is changing it will not be clear which sectors the UK should prioritise. 
1. Well known incompatibilities between US and EU will also cause problems, if we accept US agriculture this will make a good trade deal with the EU harder. It will take time for the UK to make these decisions 
1. As from the date of a no-deal Brexit UK companies will have no easy redress for business issues in the EU or countries with whom there is no trade agreement e.g. delayed containers, staff refused permission to work. 
1. The UK Government will have to take business issues up diplomatically with the EU, a process that typically takes a number of years to resolve individual issues. EU Single Market tools like Solvit will not be available
1. It is all of these reasons - not even the more excitable shortage stories - why the EU believes the threat of no-deal to be non-credible. They believe that no UK Government could survive the economic harm likely from the above
1. There is no plan from no-deal supporters to address the issues outlined above. The Government's plan is to hope the absolute worst doesn't happen, but they also have no realistic future plan 
1. No-deal puts up a high economic barrier between the UK and our largest and nearest trading partner. This cannot be a sustainable long term position, and never has been in 2000 years. 
1. As workers and consumers no deal has the potential to cause problems for millions in the UK, particularly if it happens in less than two months. This is now the key message that needs to be spread

Anyway, the plague was spread gradually through Europe, Asia, and the Middle East via trade. The bacterium itself has been shown through genetic analysis to have originated in China. It was not spread by one specific incident, namely the use of ‘plague bodies’ by the mongols during the siege of Caffa, but was in fact already present in many areas around the Mediterranean and Black Sea coastlines it had just not reached an infection level critical enough to decimate huge swathes of the population as it did a decade or so later.

doctorlao,1385323467.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_e20ov,False,"This is a perfect instance of current situational developments in the 'psychedelic renaissance' - no matter which way I slice it.

The propaganda trajectory i.e. its sequence is nicely exemplified. The starting point is an almost unbelievably puerile piece of supposed research, and by 'scientists' (as evoked).  

Next stop - media to ballyhoo it for click baiting interest. That role is played here by some typically lame pop internet outfit, dubious as the day is long - calling itself (you can't make this stuff up) 'BigThink.'  

Spreading the word 2nd hand, with all the exaggerations and fluff that can be added to make it more 'special' is important. Not a lot of the '18 to 25 year old set that likes drugs but has no rationale' (Tmac's ""target audience"" as he flattered them) subscribe to a sciencey journal like ""Psychopharmacology"" where this 'seed' was published.

From the technical publication as point of departure in the trajectory - the vital 'next step' is transplanting the 'seed' into way richer more fertile soils of internet like the embedded link to 'BigThink' - as well as yet more overtly 'special' sites for such 'news' e.g. psypost.org www.psypost.org/2018/01/psychedelic-mushrooms-reduce-authoritarianism-boost-nature-relatedness-experimental-study-suggests-50638 from ~ year ago, by yet another aspiring 'cub reporter' (for the Daily Planet).

And once the news has been spread all around for the folks at home - now 'for the common man' it can be spammed for a great big palaver in a reddy forum like - good old r-psychonaut. Where as heralded this morning it's fast pushing toward 300 posts as I type these key strokes.  

At least it can be X-posted here - if only because this subreddit now actually - exists - to maketh such possible (with thanks to my fellow mod, and good company in roundtable league of the extraordinary).

The 'infaux' or whatever the supposed 'findings' become increasingly distorted to the point of incoherence - and blatantly falsified at each step along the way first.

One observation that sticks out like a sore thumb, comparing the various 'renditions' is - a seemingly staged rhetorical equivalence as semantically forced - between key terms of sociopolitical baggage.

Where the Jan 2018 'psypost' piece cites 'authoritarian/authoritarianism' as subject of the 'scientists' study - the new-this-morning thread linking to 'BigThink' references - 'fascism' instead.

With nary a question betwixt the two of - are those synonyms?  Or being used as such - As If?  

But this verbal pea-shell shifting of 'fascism' and 'authoritarianism' merely plays upon a generally dysfunctional, fogbound state of a public preoccupied with its dramas - paralyzed like deer in headlights and increasingly challenged as things devolve - to find its rear end with its own two hands anymore. 

And that's just the more educated upper economic end.

From my standpoint (correct me someone) - 'fascism' is a term from Mussolini in league politically with the hardline rightwing 'master race' ideology of WW2 Nazi Germany - courtesy of ""Mr Hitler."" As he was so diplomatically called by Prime Minister Chamberlain upon getting back from Munich, thinking he'd just struck a ""peace for our times"" deal with ze Fuhrer.

Fascism wasn't Stalin's term for his post-Marxist brand of leftist authoritarianism. Sure authoritarianism has its left wing totalitarian forms.  But it's not a synonym of fascism.

Nor are rightwing type dictatorships the only available brands - but insofar as leftist hardliners think they're type dictatorship is some golden stairway to the stars - so they like acting as if fascism were the only type dictatorship under the sun.

Rhetorically posing the word 'fascism' as if it were a synonym for authoritarianism period - and anything 'anti-fa' would be the very paragon of anti-authoritarian - resembles a propaganda ploy of the left to my cold, discerning eye.  

And that little stunt is about what I see universally, across the board - in 'psychonaughty' ballyhooing about - this.

Indeed scanning the ideological spectrum of our times on one axis, and on the other - probing the collective mindset of a society in its baleful glare - I almost encounter a disconnection betwee two rival 'understandings' about this.  One as if true and real - the other like some impostor trying to pass itself off as 'the real deal' by shouting louder - and pointing fingers at the genuine article in hysterical accusation ('hypocrisy'!) - sounding gaslight alarms to try discrediting whoever - crying 'wolf' like some little boy in a fairy tale (who's in store for a lesson he doesn't see coming).

The 'fake' understanding is just belligerent aggression equally opposed to any middle ground of liberty - and it's shared by both extremes. The hard left and hard right posture as if they have nothing in common - it's even a point of agreement between the 'opposites' ideologically ('yes we have no common ground - it's us or them'). But otherwise the two supposed 'opposite's are more alike than different - only from ethos of liberty and constitutional rights.  Both left and right, past certain 'moderate' points of no return are hostile to freedom insofar as it's too tolerant - of what each can't stand or allow. Each side, left and right, has a more moderate zone closer to a middle ground and able to abide by even endorse values of liberty.  But each also has its equal and opposite extremes where they become 'terrible twin' - neither able to endure real freedom that doesn't 'prohibit' the 'wrong' point of view.  And both having to act like they're liberators from some horrible oppression, but - only of their hated enemies across the aisle so far they're done talking.

That there is solid ground in the middle between such extremes - on values of liberty - is anathema to both left and right hardliners. By equal and opposite authoritarian agendas of power - post-Marxists to the left of us, fascists to the right - there's no room for liberty and any such notion can only be opposed along with whatever 'enemies.'

As lyricized in 'Desperado' (The Eagles): 'Freedom? Well that's just some people talking.'

And it's this clueless muddle sociopolitically, a fine mess of our times - into which the 'psychedelic scientists' of Imperial College London presume to insert their 'research' methodologies. And checking out what they did and how ... 

I wish I'd had smelling salts in easy reach because one whiff and a guy could damn near faint.

www.reddit.com/r/RationalPsychonaut/comments/7si5wm/psychedelic_mushrooms_reduce_authoritarianism_and/ 
&lt; This study proceeds from a rigged starting point - that ""psychedelic drugs have been associated with anti-authoritarian countercultures ever since the hippies of the 1960s.""

Part of the fallacious core theoretically stands in view right there. As if hardline leftist authoritarianism e.g. antifa (Evergreen State College stalinyouth) engaging its nemesis right-wing forms of authoritarianism (fascist) - defines 'anti-authoritarian' - or can be conflated with such.

Get it? That way, Stalin by being so ruthlessly opposed to German fascism (rightwing) - becomes the model of 'anti-authoritarian.'
Like (shall we all pretend - together?) there's no such thing as leftist authoritarianism i.e. fascism's equal and opposite type dictatorship.

As if 'authoritarian' were a synonym for, or defined as - 'rightwing' extremism ('hardline conservative'). Exclusively.

As if you can't go too far left, only too far right. Because the further left the better - so there's no such thing as 'too far' that way, from any sane middle.

What are we supposed to do, pretend? Act like there's no such thing as leftist authoritarian radicalism (antifa)? Like the student gestapo last year - at ""Psilocybin State College""? As its cheerleader Paul Stamets trumpeted it last April https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFWxWq0Fv0U&amp;t=378s - warming up the audience for the collection plate pass-around. &gt;

&lt; As comparisons go - how interesting. For a source of special methods of 'investigation' - that exercise in renaissance research turned to - some ding-batty 1950s 'study of the British Electorate' - mined from a disciplinary framework of (get this) - economics and poli-sci. 

As reflects www.reddit.com/r/RationalPsychonaut/comments/7si5wm/psychedelic_mushrooms_reduce_authoritarianism_and/ :

*(T)hat five item questionnaire is really 'something' too btw. And just look at the (Carhart-Harris) self-citational 'pat on the back' in that 'recently validated' citation - as the excerpt quoted crows. And lurking behind the citation scene down at the 'ground level' of this 'mixed model with ...' turns out to be some hair-brained political science/economics look at the 'British Electorate' from the 1950s (Measuring Left-Right and Libertarian-Authoritarian Values in the British Electorate).

Whoops!

Sorry. Every time I see this question proposed, it's in relation to a narrow ""remain"" victory.

If leave won by 50.1, we would have to assume it's with whatever ""Frankenstein's monster"" of a deal May manages to blag. (It is pretty obvious, by now, that no one currently in government is prepared to sacrifice the kind of economic ""pound of flesh"" a ""No deal"" would demand).

If this were the case, then we would lurch away into the uncertainty of a future with that particular deal. I would give it a maximum of five years to show genuine social and economic benefits before people (particularly Remainers like myself) lose patience with it and the useless parties that oversaw/allowed it's inception and started looking for a new political home.

There was a great comment the other day about how contributing a portion of your wealth (ie taxes) helps the cycle of maintaining society.

I’d gladly and happily pay high taxes if it meant living in a society where all these things were benefits to citizens and readily available and properly managed. And plenty of countries, mainly in Europe, already do these things. But many politicians want you to believe it’s just impossible because that would mean ending wealth hoarding by the already obscenely rich. Wealth inequality is the basis of most other issues in this country, along with reckless spending/budgeting on behalf of our government. 

People like Candace are lovely humans and I’m glad they exist in this societal climate, but they shouldn’t have to do these things. Like others said, she’s not a millionaire. And the middle class shouldn’t have to pick up the slack of the wealthy because that just contributes to further wealth inequality. 

We’re missing billions in tax revenue from companies and rich people alike and I pay my fair share of taxes and still have to worry about healthcare deductibles and have seen death and injury from poor infrastructure.

Trois Rivieres may see a recovery in service in the next decade so long as we maintain a fairly social government in that time. VIA's car orders will serve all classes, and that's because the cars aren't cars - they are entire trainsets. The DMUs are integrated units (unlike the LRC which was an integrated pile of garbage from day one). They have power at both ends for reversible usage, meaning you can't just tack on extra cars of a differed style. Basically, in 2022 we'll be catching up to what Europe has had since the late 1970s. One interesting this you may not know yet is that for at least one year, the Rocky Mountaineer was a VIA Rail brand prior to the 1990 cuts, when the services were reduced to close to what we see today.

I wholeheartedly concur that a lawyer might be the most appropriate person to turn to. 

I have turned to the EFF for a whole lot of information, but I hadn’t considered them for legal advice. But this is an excellent point! Will do so in the future. 
What I would add here is that for example a strong organisation such as the CCC might also be a great resource, specifically on European cyber security law.

Another advice I recently got is to get a law insurance and to check with them. Though that might take longer to get a response and they will almost always try to avoid any sort of risk on their part (but they could be quite useful in case of legal issues). 

Now that I have thought about your answer and my original question more in-depth, I’ve come to realize that what simply seems so frustrating to me is that most of the cyber security law:

* is completely outdated (and obviously can’t keep up with the pace that technology is moving).
* is so ubiquitous that if someone wants to charge you with something, it would be a piece of cake to do so. 
* hinders the hackers inert curiosity of exploring the digital realm at every corner.

Reflecting on all that, it seems to me that finding a lawyer who specializes in cyber security law might be the best option. Because, as you said, he can help you to understand how the vague language of cyber security law is currently interpreted in court. Together with contacting organizations such as the CCC or the EFF, it could provide a solid basis for navigating the vagueness that is current cyber security law.

That just happens to be incompatible with current hegemony. In a multi polar world of China and United States as the poles, Russia would act just as shitty. They’re not going to suddenly quit treating their neighbors like shit and fantasizing about the Soviet Union because China builds 20 aircraft carriers. Like when they asked the United States to nuke China rather than let it pass them during the sino-Soviet split.

The world is moving beyond poles and it would be more accurate to describe it as “multi nodal” rather than any sort of poles, with everyone connected and trading in free markets. The United States, EU, China, and India will be the biggest nodes in a global trade web that benefits everyone. Russia will be just as salty under these conditions because it has delusions of grandeur and wants to be treated as a world power and it’ll have roughly the same status in such a world as it does now.

If you imagine that China is going to lean towards the interest of a country that is almost entirely irrelevant to its wealth and propserity rather than to a global system that it relies on and who relies on it for the standard of living that they all enjoy, I don’t know what to tell you.

There are reasons for the sino soviet split and the rise of China. And it’s working with the rest of the world ahead of working with Russia 

Saying China is in Russia’s camp because they both want a multi polar world is a pretty infantile understanding of geopolitics.

[deleted],,,,,,,dark,,,,"I used to think the UK had a way to good deal, used to think that a long time ago. I was wrong. It's not that their deal was way too good. It's that the leaders in the other countries shafted their own people by unnecessarily giving up so much. The euro for example is a failure, it doesn't work and should've never been attempted. 

It's not that they have it too good, it's that we got the short end of the stick and its the political elite which is to blame for that.

You've got it backwards. It's actually the EU which is blocking negotiations and destroying both its own and the British economy. Brexit will trigger the global depression and it'll also collapse the eurozone. There's absolutely no reason to not have a good trade agreement with the UK and I say this as a continental. 

The reason why they don't want to give them the agreement is because it'll show that closer integration isn't necessary and what in reality is necessary is total reform of the EU, which of course the status quo doesn't want. Total reform means all their cushy jobs will be gone, the structure of the EU will be radically altered and its pro-big business construction will be transformed into something that serves the people. That's why they don't want to negotiate.

I'm going to get downvoted for having said this but this is how it is. What the EU is doing makes absolutely no sense.
