The headline-making births last November of the world’s first gene-edited babies (twin girls) was unsurprising in one way: The scientist involved was from China. As part of its effort to dominate scientific spheres including biotechnology, China has taken the lead in testing uses of Crispr, a tool newly available to researchers enabling them to alter DNA codes simply and inexpensively. Chinese scientists were the first to test Crispr in monkey embryos, in non-viable human embryos, in adult humans, and now in creating designer babies. Now China is confronting accusations that its regulatory system is overlooking the ethical considerations and medical risks.
1 Did China approve genetic altering of the babies?

The scientist who altered the genes of the twin girls as embryos, He Jiankui, says he had approval from the medical ethics committee at Harmonicare Women and Children’s Hospital in Shenzhen. An investigation by the Chinese government found that He deliberately evaded government regulations and forged ethical review documents, the Xinhua government news agency reported on Jan. 21. The result of that investigation prompted He’s employer, Southern University of Science and Technology, to fire him.


2 What explains the uproar over this case?

Altering the genes of an embryo changes DNA in every cell, including the eggs or sperm, of the resulting person, alterations that will be passed on to progeny. The technique works by making cuts in DNA, some of which may be unintended and bring unknown effects. Normally, participants in clinical research must give their informed consent, something embryos obviously cannot do. The scientist, He, says his goal was to produce babies immune to HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, by altering a gene in the embryos that makes a protein called the CCR5 receptor, which HIV uses to enter cells. To some researchers, that’s insufficient grounds to justify such high risks, since HIV infection is relatively uncommon in China, there are other ways to prevent it and it’s treatable. Even if the gene-editing worked, the twins won’t be invulnerable to HIV, which can also invade cells via a receptor called CXCR4. What’s more, studies suggest that CCR5 deficiencies increase vulnerability to West Nile virus and influenza.
3 What rules does China have in place?

Under guidelines issued by the National Health and Family Planning Commission in 2003, gene editing of embryos isn’t banned, but the use of genetically modified eggs, sperm or embryos for reproduction is prohibited. These guidelines are not laws, and they are enforced through the commission’s ability to withdraw the licenses of fertility clinics.
4 What are the rules elsewhere?

Twenty-nine of the 47 member states of the Council of Europe human-rights organization, including France, Denmark, Switzerland and Spain, have ratified the 1997 Oveido Convention, which prohibits genetic modification of reproductive ""germline"" cells. The U.S. Congress has banned the Food and Drug Administration from considering germline-editing trials. A 2002 Australian law calls for imprisonment for 15 years for anyone who purposely makes heritable alterations in a human cell. Reports by the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine in 2017 and the U.K.’s Nuffield Council on Bioethics in 2018 concluded that human trials of editing germline cells should be used only to fill unmet medical needs and benefit those whose genes are altered.
5 What explains China’s approach?

China wants to be a leader in the defining technologies of the 21st century and has poured billions into funding research. As a participant chosen for its prestigious Thousand Talents scheme -- a plan to lure back talented Chinese from overseas -- He would have received at least a starting bonus of about $143,000 for his research, with the possibility of additional research grants of roughly $700,000. He also founded a startup called Direct Genomics that makes DNA-sequencing equipment, which also received government funding, according to its website. According to the database clinicaltrials.gov, China has 12 human trials involving the Crispr method. One of these is active, with eight in the recruiting stage. In the U.S., there are eight Crispr-related trials, six of which are recruiting and none of which are active.
6 How is China responding?

The country’s biotech companies and universities have worked hard to counter suspicions that their endeavors are rife with fraud and minimally supervised experimentation. The Genetics Society of China, the Chinese Society for Cell Biology and other groups were quick to condemn He’s gene-editing work, calling it a serious ethical violation. A Chinese branch of the World Health Organization pulled an application to register the gene-editing project in a clinical database.

* The technical advantages that are required to establish new UHP GE capacity, is worth digging into. This [reference on graphite properties](https://acs.omnibooksonline.com/data/papers/2007_D031(K).pdf) is worth a read, if you want to understand the physics and chemistry that make UHP electrodes better. The nightmarish scenario during operation of a graphite electrode is disintegration or breakup of the electrode in the furnace. Since graphite electrodes have to handle high temperatures, while simultaneously handling high voltage, steel mills with high capacity furnaces prefer graphite of higher diameter (24-inch diameter or UHP electrodes - large diameter electrodes handle high voltages better), with low CTE (coefficient of thermal expansion) resulting in high thermal stress resistance (TSR, to handle high temperatures or temperature shocks due to cooling and reheating of the furnace). China makes a significant number of electrodes with coke sourced from coal tar pitch (not even petroleum coke), instead of needle coke. High TSR GEs require needle coke over other the two forms. Producing high quality needle coke in large quantities also requires technical know-how, especially since [such technology is licensed from some player, like Chevron Lummus Global](https://www.mcdermott.com/CLG/Bottom-of-the-Barrel-Upgrading/Coking), hence the emphasis on pricing done by Phillips 66 (who would license such the proprietary technology or have something similar). So, quite a significant fraction of Chinese electrodes tend to have lower TSR, and hence the reason why they aren't export-quality. The newer UHP capacities that are being developed are therefore the more credible threat to the GE market. Adverse reactions to new Chinese capacity are not warranted, as long as established players can retain a technical edge and sustain realizations for their products.
* The stock market (at least in India) didn't efficiently price in graphite electrode stocking done by steel mills, when they were faced with a supply shock. Most Western steel producers (US/EU) have long-term contracts to manage GE requirements, and have 6-9 months of inventory. Steel producers like Outokumpu (the second largest stainless steel manufacturer in the Americas) and AK Steel, imposed an electrode surcharge on their monthly price contracts, to pass on higher input costs. Manufacturers like them, believed the short-term electrode prices were not representative of actual costs, and thus, the imposed surcharge reflected what the steel prices in an environment with a electrode supply-shock. You can visit their [Americas pricing page](https://www.outokumpu.com/en/surcharges/stainless-steel-alloy-surcharges-americas), and download the monthly price list to see the surcharges in effect from [April](https://secure.outokumpu.com/das/aaf/openReport3PDF.aspx?format=pdf&amp;type=AAS&amp;prodType=0&amp;mode=default&amp;lang=EN&amp;cult=en-US&amp;uom=ton&amp;xz=0.64d9e0afe52c3&amp;aafPeriod=201804) to [Dec](https://secure.outokumpu.com/das/aaf/openReport3PDF.aspx?format=pdf&amp;type=AAS&amp;prodType=0&amp;mode=default&amp;lang=EN&amp;cult=en-US&amp;uom=ton&amp;xz=0.b5fc413cdc3fa&amp;aafPeriod=201812) 2018.

Lack of a surcharge doesn't necessarily mean that GE electrode prices have crashed to 2017 levels, considering the surge in needle coke prices which accounts for 40% of an electrode cost; it's possible but less unlikely. The \~80$/t surcharge imposed by Outokumpu, implies that GE prices were abnormal in a certain period, and may have dropped to a more reasonable level. This new level may not as high as $80/t, but also not as low as pre-supply shock price of around $9/t, so the GE prices are effectively being absorbed by the steel mill or efficiently passed on to the steel buyer [at some price in between 9 and 80](https://www.steelonthenet.com/cost-eaf.html) ($21-24 based on electrode pricing at $10k/tonne).

The Smash community is bigger and have more influence over esport media than the entire FGC. It has more people in it, more community-based tournaments, etc. They have 3 EVO-sized tourneys during the year, and all those 3 never put any FGC scene in main stage. While the biggest FGC tourneys of the year all put Sm4sh and Melee on main stage in some forms. And in Europe alone, there's 3 times more Smash regionals and majors than FGC's regionals and majors.

The grassroots of both scenes are fundamentally different, coming from totally different places. Smash grew in livingrooms and small gatherings in highschools and colleges, while the FGC grew in the Arcades. To this day, there's very little overlap between the two communities.

People saying that Smash is not a fighting game are either trolls or in total denial. This is a legit fighting game series, just like For Honor. And both of those series are fighting games that are not supported by the FGC. I'm sick and tired of people accusing us of ""Gatekeeping"", intolerance and other bullshit, just because we want to protect and support what made the FGC what it is. Some Smash players (not all, but still) are asking respect from us, when they don't give us the respect we deserve.

PLAYER NAME: Maximilian Faber

TEAM: Krefeld Pinguine/Löwen Frankfurt

REASON HE SHOULD RECEIVE A HIGHER OVR CARD: Maximilian Faber is hands down my second favorite card in EA SPORTS NHL 19 Ultimate Team, however there are a few problems with his base card that do not reflect him as a player in real life.

He currently leads the DEL2 in scoring as a defenseman with 15 goals for Löwen Frankfurt, yet his card in HUT is a lowly 55 OVR with 37 WSA and 43 WSP. On top of that, he's the only Bronze Common skater in the game with players like David Vaysberg having a 59 OVR base despite having only 1 point in his Major Junior career with the Shawinigan Cataractes of the QMJHL.

This is not a joke when I say that Faber's card is criminally underrated in EA SPORTS NHL 19 Hockey Ultimate Team. He has the skills in real life to play with some of the best in Europe yet as mentioned prior players with almost no experience in pro hockey are rated higher than him.

Attached is a screenshot of my experience with Faber's 55 OVR across 21 games of Division 1. He has 4 goals and 13 assists, which is incredible for a player who on paper shouldn't be able to exist.

DontMentionWombats,1454377190.0,,knowswiki,[],,,dark,text,t2_uc6ci,False,"That's where you are wrong - free markets cannot continue to exist without regulation, and without government/taxation to pay for the infrastructure required for markets to function.  It is not possible.  Already Adam Smith understood this, viz. his example of roads.

""Free market"" does not mean free-for-all anarchy, corporate oligarchy, or statist control, whether right or left.  For a market to be free it must follow consistently applied and reasonable rules and laws, and allow equal access to the market for all.  I noticed that you mentioned Plan Condor - I assume you're from Chile or Argentina.  The fact that shitheads like Pinochet and Videla invited the Chicago Boys does nothing to change the positive aspects of a system of free trade - for anyone who claims otherwise, I just have to mention Stalin or Hitler.

You can be in favor of free trade and exchange while accepting that things like shitty Chinese labor practices, African raw materials exploitation, and European pollution are a filthy disgrace.  Getting rid of these is absolutely compatible with free markets and trade.  This is why rules exist, and these rules are why we no longer have things like institutionalized child labor in Europe, leaded gasoline, and many other awful things.  

Regarding your Coltan example, it's not relevant.  Free trade has been the major catalyst behind the drastic and increasing fall in extreme poverty around the world, mostly in developing nations in recent years, over the past century and a half.  There has always been injustice, and there will always be injustice, regardless of what sort of economic or political system you have; the point of the kind of regulation that allows free markets to continue existing is that it will gradually try to fix these flaws because people like you and I put pressure on both our governments and the companies to buy from to fix it.

What model phone do you have, by the way?  Where are your clothes made?

Free markets and capitalism are not a panacea.  They are not a ""system"".  They just are.  People want to trade, it is natural.  Like any activity in any society, it needs rules so people and companies do not abuse each other.  Anyone who claims otherwise is not worth listening to - and I say the same to anyone who claims to have a better idea without objective proof that it works.

&gt; Al Stewart (born in Glasgow, Scotland on 5 September 1945) is a British songwriter and musician. He is best known for his 1976 single Year of the Cat and its 1978 follow-up Time Passages (both produced by Alan Parsons). Stewart's inspiration for his songs primarily comes from the past; indeed, he is credited with creating his own genre, ""historical folk rock"". At one time in his life, Stewart took guitar lessons from King Crimson guitarist Robert Fripp.

&gt; Stewart grew up in the coastal resort town of Bournemouth, Dorset. According to  Songfacts, in days of youthful folly Stewart played in a beat group with later BBC DJ Tony Blackburn before moving to the capital to seek fortune and fame.

&gt; Having bought his first guitar from future Police guitarist Andy Summers, Stewart traded in his electric guitar for an acoustic guitar when he was offered a weekly slot at Bunjies Coffee House in London's Soho in 1965. From there, he went on to compete at the Les Cousins folk club on Greek Street, where he played alongside Cat Stevens, Bert Jansch, Van Morrison, Roy Harper and Ralph McTell

&gt; Although he had his share of the breaks, including a tenure at Bunjees coffee house and a record deal with CBS, life wasn't always easy for the young troubadour; his first serious love affair ended in disaster, and he experienced all the usual insecurities of the stranger in the big city trying to find his way.

&gt; In January 1970, Melody Maker named his second release Love Chronicles its Folk Album Of The Year, but in spite of his obviously carving out quite a name for himself, it was not until Year Of The Cat  - the single and even more so the monster album - that he really shot to fame.

&gt; He emigrated to the United States as his career took off in the mid 1970s, and still lives in California. While studio albums are now few and far between, he still tours extensively in the United States, and, most years, in Europe. Recordings of concerts are often made available through his fan clubs.

Or the psyche of straight men.  It created all types of insecurities that caused you to feel the need to overcompensate for the sake of others and as a result become toxic.

In the 1950s something happened in American and European culture which resulted in the socially normal male identity becoming rather toxic.  What triggered this major paradigm shift is not agreed upon but was possibly tied to WW2 causing widespread PTSD in most of America and Europe's male populations.  These men who suffered from the truly horrible emotional scars of WW2 then went on to become role models for their sons.  A man being emotionally withdrawn, callous, brooding, avoiding physical human contact, and regularly exhibiting aggressive outbursts lines up rather well with this timeline.

&gt;&gt; On Thursday, intelligence police and National Guard officials threatened to board a tanker docked at PDVSA’s Cardon port, on Venezuela’s western coast, to pressure the vessel’s crew to discharge diesel that had not been paid for by PDVSA and was sold by U.S. refiner Citgo Petroleum, according to four sources.
&gt;
&gt;Refineries in the United States have started to reduce crude processing, and Valero said Thursday that it had stopped buying Venezuelan crude.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; The tanker carrying diesel arrived in Venezuelan waters on Jan. 25 before sanctions were issued, and finished unloading a first parcel of diesel at Puerto la Cruz refinery’s dock earlier this week, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; European refiners and oil firms including PDVSA’s partner Nynas AB and Spain’s Repsol have put on hold cargoes that were scheduled to be shipped from Venezuela until the U.S. Treasury clarifies if oil swaps will be allowed and European countries announce any sanctions to come, according to sources and Refinitiv Eikon data.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; U.S. sanctions do not prohibit Europe from receiving Venezuelan oil or trading houses, including Europe-based ones like Trafigura or Vitol, from acting as intermediaries for Venezuelan cargoes to be ultimately sold to refineries around the world.

The advice I'm about to give you is not standard in the EU/NA community so it'll seem weird to many people here, but it's worth thinking about. This is not cookie-cutter newbie advice.

Adrenaline Hammer Guy is a pretty common archetype in the Chinese BB community. You give him a weapon with the stagger effect (e.g. 2-handed mallet), which will knock enemies to the end of the turn queue. It will also lower their initiative in the next turn, as well. Your bro's high initiative means he will tend to go before enemies and stagger them, ensuring that the staggered target can be hit by all of your guys before he gets to respond.

This pairs well with other 2-handers, double-grippers, and DPS bros in general, as the damage-dealers can swarm the staggered target and kill them without being in much danger.

I personally would give him Colossus (or Student if you're confident you can keep him alive), Dodge, Adrenaline, Recover, and Backstabber (because he has crap melee skill). He will need to rely on surround bonuses to hit reliably, which is unfortunate but unavoidable on this particular bro. He is a flanker and will usually move in to attack guys who are already engaged.

Keep in mind that initiative drops as fatigue builds in a counterintuitive way (https://www.reddit.com/r/BattleBrothers/comments/afqgij/have_i_been_misunderstanding_how_fatigue_effects/), so you will need to be careful with his fatigue. He will need melee skill, melee defense, fatigue, and a sprinkling of initiative when he low-rolls in other stuff. Gifted would be good here. Eventually going Colossus-&gt;Nimble will also do wonders for his survivability while keeping his fatigue low and his initiative high (with mid-range lightish armour).

This guy will be useful in this role from the early game through to the end game, but he will survive much better in early levels with Colossus and Dodge.

Nations of Europe and Asia have already developed extensive high speed rail lines in their country. States like Germany, France, and China have created systems that efficiently move people across their countries. These high speed rail lines have cut down on traffic congestion, and have been good for the environment. Even the United States has some high speed rail lines within its borders. 

Unfortunately, Canada has not gotten around to this. As of this moment, we are the only G7 country without high speed rail. This is not because Canada is unsuitable for high speed rail. The Quebec-Windsor Corridor and Edmonton-Calgary Corridor are well positioned for this technology to be implemented. 

As Prime Minister, I am proud to say that I began the process of finally bringing High Speed Rail to this Country. I am even more proud to stand here today and present a concrete plan that will deliver Canada's first true High Speed Rail Line. 

The benefits of this plan are obvious. Travel by train is more environmentally friendly than having everyone drive in a car. Given the ever present threat climate change poses, it is important that we consider this fact when making our transport policy. 

The rail line would also generate money for the country. Such a project would spur investment in the region, bringing in new sources of tax revenue. The plan would also likely result in more ridership on trains in the area, leading to increased revenue from fares. 

Further, the plan will reduce the stress places on the 401, the 417, and Autoroute 20. This will reduce traffic on these roads, and reduce the stress they are under. I'm sure we all know that the 417, just a few blocks away from this House, is under a lot of stress, and any reduction to the number of cars on it would be a great benefit. 

I urge all in this House to vote for this bill. This is an important infrastructure investment, and a major step for Canada into the 21st century. We are already behind other countries in this respect, a delay will just push us back further. Let us not let that happen.

He is not making that claim in the slightest.

He’s saying that the facts underlying those incorrect viewpoints are not controversial, in that they are not contested. He is also saying the *conclusions* drawn from those facts by the alt-right are absurd and incorrect because the people coming to those conclusions lack the tools to understand the data and interpret it correctly.

He gives the example “African Americans commit more violent crimes than European Americans.” That statement is statistically correct. It is not a controversial statement in and of itself. He even invites you to view the data on the Department of Justice website to verify that it is true. Please do so if you doubt the accuracy of that statistic.

He then explains how the alt-right, lacking the tools to understand the reasons *why* that is the case, make the erroneous claim that it must be so becasue African Americans are *genetically predisposed to violence*, which is a conclusion one cannot draw from the premise without support, of which there is none.

So it goes with gender essentialism. The statement “Men and women have different priorities” is true. Acknowledging that statement as true does not mean you, by necessity, must believe that to be true because men and women are intrinsically different. 

The fact that you don’t understand Pinker’s position here suggests you don’t have much experience with his work outside of youtube clips and critiques of his work that support your presuppositions.

Moreover, as the human body does not differentiate fructose absorption, whether it comes from HFCS, cane or beet sugar, or from an intrinsic source such as that present in fruits or fruit juices( 19 , 46 , 47), would this reduction also be necessary for fruits that contain relatively large amounts of fructose such as apples, apricots and ripe bananas? Should honey also be removed from our diet( 48 )? These questions have confused the typical consumer of sweet (and sweetened) food products( 49 ). This confusion may have been intensified by the issuing of a scientific opinion on fructose by EFSA in 2011. With this, European food manufacturers can claim that ‘consumption of fructose leads to a lower blood glucose rise than consumption of sucrose or glucose’( 50 ). Having evaluated the scientific literature at their disposal(47 , 51 – 57 ), the EFSA panel assumed that, when fructose replaces sucrose or glucose in foods or beverages, the claimed effect will be obtained. The panel took into account two human intervention studies(51 , 52 ) that showed a consistent significant reduction in postprandial glycaemic responses. This occurred without disproportionally increasing postprandial insulinaemic responses. Further, the panel noted that the mechanism by which fructose (when replacing sucrose or glucose) in food or beverages could exert the claimed effect was well established.
The panel did note that high intakes of fructose (set at ≥ 25 % of total energy) was shown to lead to metabolic complications such as dyslipidaemia, insulin resistance and increased visceral adiposity, based on several review articles( 47 , 53 – 56 ). With this scientific opinion, and related health claim, the panel clearly took a different position from the opinion that fructose is toxic and should be treated as alcohol

EtadanikM,1470441942.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_105wcs,False,"Look, people are going to complain that it's not fair, not merit based, etc. But this was obvious from the start: to be all merit based, you can't have developers and organizers deciding anything at all. ALL positions have to be based on merit. Since you can't have regions playing each other constantly in qualify, the way it has to be done then is:

* Season should start with 3 teams for every region = 18 total for the first major tournament. This is the season kick off. The reason not to use the international is because teams usually change players right after.
* Teams finish where they will. Now, you determine 15 region slots by average team placement: top region = 4, 2nd region = 3, 3rd region = 3, 4th region = 2, 5th region = 2, 6th region = 1.
* Each major tournament after, repeat the process based on the previous major tournament's results.
* Using *average* placement ensures regions aren't penalized for having fewer teams in a tournament. In fact, they are rewarded for doing so since there is a higher chance of that team doing better and raising the regional average. But this advantage quickly goes away in the event that their next best team can't cut it.
* Break ties with highest finishing team, then lowest finishing team, then previous major tournament placement, until there is no tie

Using this system, after the last major tournament, we'd have the following:

* Europe - 4 slots with average finish of **7.0**
* Southeast Asia - 3 slots with average finish of **7.0**
* China - 3 slots with average finish of **7.25**
* Russia - 2 slots with average finish of **7.5**
* North America - 2 slots with average finish of **8.3**
* South America - 1 slot with average finish of **9.0**

Which it sounds like, is what everybody wants, right?

**EdF**: had his time getting us to the semi finals last season and while I'm grateful for the magical evening that saw us knock Barcelona out, I don't think he's ready yet. He's like, just slightly better than Enrique for us at this point and that's not what we need. That said, whenever we talk about firing a manager, we have to talk about his replacement. Is there anyone out there who would be an improvement whom Pallotta will pay for? I can't think of anyone if one exists.

**Monchi**: I'm done with this guy. I can't deny his results at Sevilla, but maybe he was just lucky with investments there. His transfer record with us has been poor at best, and he's not even better than Sabatini. Way overrated and I wish him luck.

At one point there were three teams after him (Real Madrid, Liverpool, Chelsea), and Chelsea ended up paying even more for Kepa than Liverpool did for Alisson. I don't remember the last time a team overhauled a roster, bringing in 10 new players after reaching the semifinals of the Champions League.

I get it, we need money, and our players were getting old. That said, selling players can only get you so much money each year, while building on what we had as a squad for sustainable success is more of a long-term solution. Of course I'm not saying we'll reach the semifinals every year, but even the knockout stages would've been nice. Now we risk not even making the Champions League at all. 

Okay fine, let's say he had to sell, but how about reinvesting that money wisely? Who are some of his better investments? Kolarov, Zaniolo, Under... that's it? Maybe Olsen (despite that horror show vs Fiorentina)? What about guys like Bianda, Coric, Marcano, Rui, Karsdorp? Schick has been an absolute disappointment, and the veterans like Cristante and NZonzi haven't been spectacular by any means. Remember Jonathan Silva and Hector Moreno? Gregoire Defrel and Maxime Gonalons? Those guys barely lasted over a year and were garbage during their stay here. Make no mistake: he has downgraded our roster at every single position by a significant margin.

And guess what, because of these downgrades and failure to go far in Europe, we'll be going back to selling players again for half their worth now that we're an established ~~supermarket~~ bargain bin.

Because of this I have relatives in Washington and California, which creates a cultural connection to those states. I have several Chinese Canadian friends who have a similar family history of migration along the coast, so it's a common pattern. 

If you look further back, in the early days our province was populated by British supporters from Oregon territory who fled when the Americans took over Oregon. These people brought some of their (mixed) culture with them, as did the next wave from California. At this time, Chinook language was commonly spoken in communities in BC, Wash &amp; Oregon, contributing to a shared culture. Even if we don't speak it today, the diversity it allowed in trade and social interactions must have contributed to our culture, as does the Salish cultures that cross today's border.

As a rule, if someone asks ""what PHP framework should I use for a project"" and they're asking for a project that I'm not personally involved in architecting, the fact that they're asking generally means they're the market segment Laravel works nicely for. This includes solo developers (again, not my personal choice, but using it for a solo project means if you ever have to hand it off to someone else they'll kind of know what's going on). Plus Laravel has a strong ecosystem all the way to the shallow end of the pond, so to speak.

By contrast, Symfony (Laravel uses a number of Symfony components, but in a quite different way) has made huge strides in getting the framework to a point where it's easier to set up, but they'll admit that they're playing catch-up to Laravel.

Cnut the Great (; Old English: Cnut se Micela; Old Norse: Knútr inn ríki; c. 995 – 12 November 1035), also known as Canute, whose father was Sweyn Forkbeard (which gave him the patronym Sweynsson, Old Norse: Sveinsson), was King of Denmark, England and Norway; together often referred to as the North Sea Empire.

Yet after the deaths of his heirs within a decade of his own, and the Norman conquest of England in 1066, this legacy was lost. He is popularly invoked in the context of the legend of King Canute and the tide, which usually misrepresents him as a deluded monarch believing he has supernatural powers, contrary to the original legend which portrays a wise king who rebuked his courtiers for their fawning behaviour.

As a Danish prince, Cnut won the throne of England in 1016 in the wake of centuries of Viking activity in northwestern Europe.

As for protected. Take a German doctor licensed to practice medicine in Germany. Personally I’d be  perfectly fine with giving him my money to be my doctor, because I trust the German government medical licensing procedures. Same thing with most OECD licensed doctors. But what does it take for those doctors to come here and practice medicine, it is a monumental undertaking and they have to complete another six years of residency. Nursing is not easy either it’s very difficult for foreign trained  nurses to come to United States. Just those two facts right there severely limit medical labor thus raising costs. The reason US doctors are paid so much more isn’t because they’re better....it’s becusse there’s fewer of them.

Funnily enough in the 1920s that’s exactly what happened European doctors were flocking in mass to the United States because of a recession in Europe. American doctors were getting upset they were facing downward pressure and wages the lobby Congress in the mid to late 1920s the AMA gained a monopoly power over licensure.

 The same is true of hospitals. If you’re in the city and you want to open a hospital you need permission from all the other hospitals in your region first. Think about opening a restaurant but before you can do that need permission from all your other competing restaurants. This is the federal certificate of need. 

 Let’s not even go into pharmaceuticals in that shit show. there’s also massive barriers on medical equipment, robotics and basic tools.  I work in ERP consulting. That’s enterprise resource planning, I help large firms implement incredibly complex software suites that manage everything from finance to CRM to internal IT etc. etc. 

Hospitals for all there mounds of money they are insanely slow in implementing new ERP systems. Slower than any other industry I’ve ever seen. Part of this is regulatory compliance but a much larger part is a mix of government regulations causing a distortion in price signals and a complete and total lack of competition.  Large firms constantly implement new systems and get rid of old systems to upgrade and become more efficient to save costs and generate revenue. When firms do this and they’re in competition with other firms it creates a downward pressure on prices despite regular inflation. Alternatively you keep prices stable and wages in those industries rise, see big tech as a perfect example.  but in the medical industry this does not happen. Some of the ERP tools they use look like shit straight out of the 80s it’s so bad it’s revolting and somewhat insulting. I’ve seen some of these hospital groups and what’s their financial statements, the kind of money they could throw around on cutting-edge systems that would drastically enhance patient management, patient outcomes And drastically reduce overhead costs.

Pre-Order/ Devolpment funding. There an old joke in the table top gaming industry. How do you make a small fortune in the gaming? Start with a larger fortune. Profit margin for games, are incridibly tiny. After publishing, shipping, warehouse, retial cut most games have are floating int he low double digit to single digit profits. Games only start making money, when they are ever green, and when they get to mass retail.

Release Date: Pretty much impossible to gauge. Very few board games folks, are doing this full time, and even if they were, the amount of time actually making games is a fraction of the time. Adminstration time, community management time are much more time expensive and almost always more time critical. Then there are third party, who the dev doesnt have much control over when they deliver. 

Shipping confirmations, tracking, notifications. This is also, pretty fucking hard. A lot of games are manufactured over seas, and sent over in as large bundle as possible in bulk freight shipping. Like my copy of Red Market was printed, I think in Hong Kong. Shipped in a boat, from there to California, from California shipped over to Las Vegas and then shipped back to me in Mojave california. The only point in that chain where my inddivual tracking infomration comes into it, is when it hits the regional distributor to me. But that when its done like 85 to 90 percent of its travel. Its all slow bulk freight. 

And this just assuming things just go fine. Red Market as an example again, all their european customers almost didnt get their books because of EU toy shipping regulation and choking hazzards. After weeks of delay, talking to other industry vetrans, talking to EU trade regulators over skype at shit ass in the middle night hours. It looked like they were going to have to pay for custom packaging and pay for it to be ceritfied by the EU to be shipped in Europe. Entirely unexpected, and incridibly expensive process.

One player I would love to have is:

Jarno Kärki

Liiga, Porin Ässät

Ässät has been horrible this year but Kärki was having a great career year before he was sold to switzerland so ässät could save some money.

One thing for the content team, and mostly for anyone who is in charge of the player overalls of european players:

Many of the player overalls are super random, good example here:

We have these two Kärpät players: Jasper Lindsten and Sami Anttila

Lindsten had 2 30ish point seasons in a row and is on track for another one this season.

Anttila is career high 7point player

Their overalls, as you would guess are 60 and 69, Lindsten being the lower overall here.

Another example; Antti Suomela, last year he won scoring in Liiga with 60points in 55gp. And Suomela is now NHL-player for the Sharks, yet his overall is only 67, that makes him the 14 highest base card overall player on the collection of JYPs players(his team last season)

Random silver players from european leagues are of course not that popular to use on your ultimate team.  But just little more recognition for the euros could mean something for someone.

I do remember Tomi Kallio getting a Milestone card in nhl 14 or 15, maybe for becoming like the highest scoring foreign player in SHL(not 100% sure what was the milestone, and at the time everyone else was confused also). So in Finnish Liiga Canadian Eric Perrin became last year the highest scoring foreign player and this season he achieved the status of having most games played by foreigner.

&gt; The Police were a new wave band which formed in 1977 in London, England. The band consisted of Sting (vocals, bass), Andy Summers (guitar) and Stewart Copeland (drums).  The band released five albums -- ""Outlandos d'Amour"" (1978), ""Reggatta de Blanc"" (1979), ""Zenyatta Mondatta"" (1980), ""Ghost in the Machine"" (1982) and ""Synchronicity"" (1983) -- before entering a hiatus in 1984 and ultimately disbanding in 1986

&gt; The band reunited in January 2007 for a reunion tour that lasted until August 2008. 

&gt; Biography 

&gt; The Police formed in early 1977 in London by Stewart Copeland (drums), Gordon Sumner, better known as Sting (bass and lead vocals), and Henry Padovani (guitar). Andy Summers later joined the group, and after a very short stint as a quartet, Padovani left the band. The Police became one of the most popular bands in the late 70s and throughout the 80s.

&gt; The Police are notable as one of the first mainstream white pop groups to adopt reggae as a predominant musical form and to score major international hits with reggae-styled material. (The first all-white reggae band with permanent members and frequent recording in Europe was Peps Blodsband, lead by Peps Persson from south Sweden who changed from blues to reggae 1974/75). Although reggae was already very popular in the United Kingdom (due to the large number of Caribbean immigrants) and a number of Western European countries, reggae was little known in the United States and rejected by most black artists in U.S, and prior to the emergence of the Police only a handful of reggae songs had enjoyed any significant chart success. The Police, UB40, The Clash and Bob Marley (Jamaican, partly living in England after being shot in Jamaica, are considered with a number of new wave, rock and ska bands as one of the leaders of the Second British Invasion of the U.S.

&gt; The Police were strongly influenced by reggae (especially reggae drumming and base lines), jazz and, in the beginning, punk rock – something that came to be shifted more and more towards pop during the 80s. Their lyrics also changed from challenging, but yet somewhat politically restrained punk- and new wave lyrics, to after 1982 in some songs emphasize environmental awareness and human oneness. The biggest hits, however, had romantic or sexual themes. The Police met together with other ""white"" British bands which played reggae, as UB40,  criticism from black English rastafarian reggae bands like Aswad (in a BBC documentary on TV) and Steel Pulse, for being accomplices in the music industry of ""Babylon"", stealing the Caribbean slave descendants' musical treasure. This criticism has later been withdrawn. Aswad has even made the covers of Police songs like ""Roxanne"".

&gt; Tension grew between the band members, because unlike most other bands, they did not share songwriting credits. They released their last album, Synchronicity, in 1983, selling over 8 million copies. Synchronicity is critically regarded as their best album, with hits such as Synchronicity II, King of Pain, and probably their best known song, Every Breath You Take. In 1984, after touring in support of Synchronicity, The Police went on hiatus while Sting pursued his acting and solo music careers. Two years later, The Police reformed and played a few concerts for Amnesty International.  Soon after the band went into the studio. Sting wanted to re-record their old songs but Andy and Stewart wanted to leave the originals alone and only two songs were re-recorded during these studio sessions. Although the group is considered to have disbanded in 1984, 1986 was the last time The Police engaged in any musical activity. 

&gt; In 1992 the band released ""Message in a Box"", their 4 CD box set, and performed at Sting's wedding to Trudie Styler.  A live CD was released in June 1995. On March 10, 2003 The Police were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  and performed Message in a Bottle, Roxanne and Every Breath You Take.

&gt; The Police reformed in 2007 and opened the Grammy award ceremony of that year with a performance of Roxanne. Towards the end of May the band began a world tour.  In  2008  the tour ended at Madison Square Garden, New York on August 7, and The Police disbanded for good.  Sting was quoted towards the end of the tour that he had achieved closure with the band and revealed that The Police would never tour or record again. 

&gt; Sting has said that the material on the album Ghost in the Machine were inspired by the writings of Arthur Koestler, and that the Police's final studio album Synchronicity was influenced by the writings of Carl Jung. Sting also peppers his songs with literary allusions: the song ""Don't Stand So Close to Me"" mentions Vladimir Nabokov's  novel Lolita; ""Tea in the Sahara"" alludes to the novel The Sheltering Sky by Paul Bowles; and ""Wrapped Around Your Finger"" refers both to the sea monsters Scylla and Charybdis, from Greek mythology, and to Mephistopheles, from the German legend of Faust .

Shadie777,1395157491.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_fqzib,False,"I wouldn’t say extreme, but I would say hard remainers are those who can’t accept a compromise brexit. You can usually see some comments saying that they wouldn’t go for customs union with single market integration (which is only a starting point in negotiations of course) because it’s worse than EU membership.

This is true, but constantly shitting on the only compromise brexit measure we have with the EU on this matter will lead to a bad outcome. Only campaigning for remain will cause societal destabilisation through ignoring the 52%. Never realising they are doing the same thing hard brexiteers doing by ignoring remainers and going for the hardest possible brexit.  

The argument should have always been that a soft brexit is what was mandated with the opportunity to join in the future if we want.

Now I understand that Russia’s interference has made an impact. I’m of the opinion that they exploited what was already there. There was always a divide in Britain over the EU, and I’m worried that just cancelling brexit without listening to the 52% will destabilise us.  Just like how not listening to the 48% has fucked us over the last 2 years.  

I said this before, and I will say it again, this lack of compromise has fucked us over. Just like the hard brexiteers lack of compromise fucked over brexit negotiations from the very start. This total divide has totally played into Russia’s hands.

The best way out of this situation is a soft brexit, and for me the added caveat of another referendum on the proposed deal at the end of this.

&gt; The Institute of Directors warned that 29% of firms in a survey of 1,200 members believed Brexit posed a significant risk to their operations in the UK and had either moved part of their businesses abroad already or were planning to do so.

&gt; Large companies such as Sony and Panasonic have relocated their European headquarters from the UK to the continent, but the IoD said smaller companies were also enacting plans.

&gt; The survey of company directors found that 11% had already executed relocation plans and 5% were planning to relocate in connection with Brexit, while a further 13% were &amp;quot;Actively considering&amp;quot; a move out of the UK. Exporters were more likely to consider a move, with two-thirds looking to shift overseas.

And I love arguing with atheists because they have no knowledge whatsoever about history especially after a sentence like this "" This sounds like something written by someone who has gotten most of  their knowledge of history from The History Channel post 2004 or so. "" 

Buddy it seems that you got that from history 101. 

"" Sure it is, buddy. I'm not the one arguing that a benefit that results to  a very-few for a very-short time qualifies as ""good"", but knock  yourself out in your incomprehension. ""

You are making a claim with no backup whatsoever and you say I'm knocking myself out ? Unemployment was dropped from over 30% to under 10. Even after the war when Germany was completely destroyed which would other countries take years and years to get to a certain level o social standard Germany is now the biggest power house in the EU and of the biggest in the world. Don't be irritated I'm not German and I oppose every aspect of their politics during the nazi regime  

Regarding Dostoevsky, where have I given you the implication that I find it hard disagreing with you regarding that matter ? In your first response you haven't said anything about it. Cool buddy you agree with them, I never heard of them except Immanuel Kant whom I also very much respect and I heard about Hume but never read anything about him or let's say much. What I saw the others are comedians, authors and doctors of medicine. But whatever fits your agenda.  Dostoevsky was praised by Kafka, Einstein and even Nietzsche (I don't need to say anything else). But you are right of course not universally correct, everyone needs to make his own decisions

""No, my moral values are a lot more broad-based than that, as I've shown. ""

No they are not. Ok well maybe not yours but the values of western civilazation are based on it. And it really doesn't matter if you point out that there have been prior to Judaism similiar moral values. The fact is that todays western civilazation is based on the Judeo-Chrisitan values. Even atheists acknowledge that. Of course not all especially Anti-Theists because they oppose everything what has to do with christianity and they'd rather link their moral values with values of mesopotemia than Judeo-Christian ones but with no link to them. Again you can't deny the past just because it doesn't fits your agenda.  (coming back saying love arguing with people with history 101 knowledge...note you started with this mocking so don't get mad at me) 

"" Because it reduces the value of the testing and puts you into a position  wherein you achieve grades that you cannot back-up in a practical  environment. ""

This isn't an argument because there is no point in the value of testing if it doesn't bring someone forward who has no moral values because it makes no sense to have it for someone who believes that there is no god

"" Because it breaks the possibility of trust and lowers your sense of accomplishment in your abilities."" 

A man with no morals or the need to be moral doesn't need trust and accomplishment is not directly linked with theft. Some of the biggest thieves have accomplishement more than the ones they are stealing from. 

"" As I said much earlier, I don't require a ""highground"" from which to  preach, because I don't subscribe to the ""from authority"" framework that  religious people need for their sense of self. ""

No you don't require one from which to preach but why should anybody listen to you ? Just because you said ? What is the point or the base of it ? Why is right right and wrong wrong ? In christianity line between right and wrong is a straight one that links directly to God. But you could jump around those line as you please and make it up for yourself which fits and benefits you the most. If you want to do it like that you can of course. You have free will and can do anything what you want. I'm not talking about YOU, I'm talking about the western civilization and his foundation. 

"" I can answer the main question there, but the more-important element is  your admission right there: Why do you require someone to *know* about how good you were or were not? Why do you care whether or not someone will remember your acts? ""

Is this really a question ? You are talking to someone who believes in the christian God. Think about that for a moment.

""Society"" doesn't decide anything; it's an abstract concept used to talk about the *result* of a shit-ton of individuals living their lives in close-contact with one another.""

Well...yes it actually does. They decide if you action are right or wrong and this concept they have again (talking about western civilization) from Judeo-Christian values. If you think like this Hitler could have also said I don't care what the rest of the world says those are my values and I need no moral highground like you said to tell you in my opnion what is right or wrong

""Because we're not them, don't live in their situation, and it's  functionally-impossible for one people to ""take"" the society of another  like putting on clothes.""

Exactly...you live (I think at least) in a western society with those moral values that's why your's (even if you claim that they are not linked to the Judeo-christian ones) match them so I don't know what you point here is...

 ""Except ""why"" isn't a counter for any of it. It's a chance to examine and elucidate, and is not something to be feared.

And  you haven't actually done that. You've instead tried to push a  short-term racist theory of benefit, which falls apart on its face.

Additionally,  literally no-one here has claimed moral high ground, or perfection.  That's a reaction you're having because of your need for morality to  descend from authority.""

Except it is if you can't back it up with anything. You are just saying those are my believes and that's it with no backup whatsoever.

You can say that you think that this is and that is good or wrong but you get your concept of good and wrong from Judeo-christian values and you can't deny that. And although some other societies have similiar moral values your's don't derive from them of course I say again if you live in a western society. And I'm not saying Atheist can't have moral values but there is no reason to be moral if there is no God because there is not a standard what moral is without God and what it should be like. It is basically pointless to have moral values rationally thinking and that what this argument is about. Why was it not moral what Hitler, Stalin, Mao Tse Tong and many other evil dictators did when you have no backup of morality. The best you could say is I don't think it's good but this is not universally correct so their moral vaules can be quite as good or bad as mine and by not saying that you indeed claimed moral highground. 

"" When morality doesn't descend from authority, this childish need to  jockey for moral position (""higher"" vs ""lower"", ""better"" vs ""worse"",  ""perfect"" vs ""imperfect"", etc)  ""

Here you said it yourself. You don't need this ""childish jockey for moral position"" so this shuts down your own argument that you need morals at all because it doesn't make sense to have some if there is no God.

""Including, of course, God. ""

Right buddy...

""Pro-tip: more exclamation points do not make your argument stronger. They just make you look desperate. ""

Pro-Tip #2: Sorry I didn't know we are writing on the New York Times rather than reddit.

PS: haven't even seen your comment from you post before: "" (and we're left in the fun position of having the religious people argue *in favor* *of Hitler*, which is always a good time for all concerned.) ""

Again I must say almost ""pathetic"" attempt...Where have I argued in favor of Hitler ? This post is about why was it wrong what Hitler did without the concept of God and all you did was sounding like a good christian but dismissing that your moral values come from God. Why is it so hard to acknowledge that your perception of good and wrong come from Juedeo-Christian values ? As I said above you can live and acknowledge those values as your own without believing in God this is you right to do. But this is just Anti-theism you are preaching trying desperatly to prove that they are not coming from those values.

Says you. But what a lot of the uppity portion of Northerners don't understand is its subjective. I think Pro 14 is utter dogshit as a spectacle, but I know it does the job just fine for many people.

&gt; Is it any wonder that you can't retain players if you play half as many games

If you honestly think that is the reason why a lot of players leave to Europe or Japan, you have failed at basic economics.

&gt; NZRU neglects every opportunity to maximise revenue (or get anywhere close) by playing in places like Nelson, population 3 men, 5 sheep, and a dog.

You do understand ticket sales at venues make up a very small portion of what NZRU rakes in? And evidently, they care more about their fan base than what you're accustomed to by playing in smaller locations.

Honestly after that rant and all the effort you put into suggesting ns on ""fixing"" someone else's shit, you should take a long hard look at yourself before providing that advice.

Have a car?  


In 2014 I drove down from Chicago in the dead of winter.. 30 days of freezing temps in a row.. down to Miami.. 


I was thinking it would be about a month trip..


Then went on a couple of cruises.. 


Got into sailing..


Decided to go to Disney World.. then New Orleans.. then Texas.. then LA.. then more sailing all over the Caribbean.... more cruises..


I ended up driving to around 35 states.. ALL car camping 
( r./urbancardwelling r/vandwelling r/priusdwelling )


More sailing in Europe.. and even more cruises 


Now I've spent the past 7 months in 7 countries backpacking around Asia with 
a small 21l backpack and plan to go to around 6-10 other countries the rest of this year..  here in Vietnam now and headed to the Philippines tomorrow.


I don't have any plans on stopping to be honest..  next obtainable goal is to visit 100 countries.. and then maybe try and see all 195 in the world.  But I don't take that seriously until I get to 100 first. 


Also debating on circumnavigating the world by sailboat .. but idk - it's also a huge undertaking..


I started off just going on a month long ""road trip"" .. and the rest..  just kinda happened..


Almost got killed by a deer about 6 years ago.. since then my thoughts on life and what's important changed even more.. you never know when it's your time..


""  Twenty Years From Now You Will Be More Disappointed By The Things You Didn’t Do Than By The Ones You Did Do  ""    


I quit a business making around $350K a year.. working 100 hours a week and I hated my life.. money isn't everything.. 

Now I stay in the cheapest hostels available, eat cheap street food, take the bus over a flight even if it only saves me $10.. 

I know this doesn't make sense to some, but $1 I save today is $1 I can spend tomorrow..  

I'm way happier living this way and out there seeing the world living my frugal life than I was driving around one of my luxury or exotic cars trying to impress others.  

I've had an amazing life ever since.. and it's just getting better.. 

Only been traveling 5 years but it's been the most fun and incredibly rewarding.

Shortly : you are kind of** wrong because you are looking from a wrong perspective and possibly don't know much about Turkey.

Long version : I mean, 4 million people from any parts of the world would have some kind of effects unfortunately. Though you are probably right in a sense, general sentiment towards refugees have become worse. Though I also think Turkish people have proven how accepting they are and even with raising tensions I wouldn't call them hateful or xenophobic. Name me a country that can take 4 million refugees while having a economic crisis and not have major riots. Europe is quite strong economically and even they lost their shit for few thousand refugees. Most of the negativity in Turkey are still localized and pretty mild.

I wouldn't call it a war between seculars and non-seculars because those definitions have become inadequate to understand people long time ago. It is only foreigners who only follow Turkey from western media who think that way. There are many other dynamics within Turkey right now and secularism is only a small part of it. I would say recent issues are mostly oriented around freedom of expression, law, media etc.

Speaking about western media: I wouldn't call Turkish became hateful towards Europe but I would say they have become more disillusioned. That is due to everyone from every demographic in Turkey realizing how Europeans(media, politicians) don't understand Turkey at all. I think this is a good thing because ultimately it is the peoples job to make things right. I think it is best people in Turkey realize they aren't gonna get any free help from EU/US/Russia or any other parts of the world.

I don't think the UK gets a good return on investment from primary and secondary education. I think 18 year olds in Ireland have a better basic skill set than their counterparts in the UK. I base this on the quality of school leavers and graduates from NI as compared to primarily Dublin.

Secondly - there are no hard right or hard left political parties in Ireland of particular note. We have two main centre parties, we have Sinn Fein which is somewhat left and a bit populist and we have labour who are centre left and not populist.

We have proportional representation instead of first passed the post so parliament is full of independents. We have independent government ministers.

We have no history of Euroscepticism as a political platform.

We do not have right or left wing popular press. We have rags, but broadsheet media in Ireland is neither right nor left nor leans obviously to one party.

The Irish edition of the mail and the UK version of the mail are a good example of the differences. Both total rags but the Irish mail is just full of lowest common denominator stuff - the dailymail is total propaganda.

Try living in Britain and working in what is technically unskilled labour, watching your wage stagnate, or skilled labour with an influx of competition able to work more cheaply then you because their family is back in Poland so supporting them costs less.

Travelling through a place is awesome, but it doesn't give you enough experience to start making judgement calls on the country, or the decisions made by the people living and working there effected by EU membership in their everyday life.

Your ease of travel plays second fiddle to that.

The problem is that servers stops accepting new players from matchmaking after changing map. So you are forced to leave the server and find a new match or continue playing in a match that probably ends up in a draw because of the time limit. This seems to start happening when the amount of players starts dropping (around 21:30-22:00 CET here in Europe). 


This is a good thing since they can shut down servers during the night (costs less money) and focus the player base into a smaller amount of servers. But it also sucks for us players since we have to leave the server and search a new match. Our record is switching server 5 or 6 times during a Friday night because of this. And if you are unlucky you end up playing the same maps over and over again. And if you are more than 4 people playing together... have fun.

tdzida26,1420477918.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_kiyiq,False,"&gt;Yea dude get fucked with your “Muslims are the victim” nonsense. Muslims invaded and nearly conquered all of Spain. They wiped out Byzantine Christianity not to even mention what they did to Jews.

Byzantine Empire was weakened by fighting against the Muslim Turks, other European christian countries and by civil wars, the Ottomans were the one who managed to conquer Constantinople in the end, and the downfall of the Byzantine Empire didn't occur in just 1 year it has gradually falling for hundreds of years, most notably it has never recovered from the forth crusade.

Most conquests of the early muslim Empire were due to economic reasons not religious. Most people could keep their religion but that meant that they needed to pay taxes for it. When the crusades conquered Jerusalem there was a large chrisitian and jewish population living there, and if I'm not mistaken Jews had it much better in the Muslim Empire than in Europe. The Roman population that was conquered was allowed to keep their faith and a lot of Roman administrators worked for the Umayyad Calipate after thhe conquest.

&gt;Islam is an ideological plague. I’m not even Christian but look at Mohammed. He was a conquering warlord who enslaved women and turned them into sex slaves. He married a fucking six year old. But don’t worry. He didn’t fuck her till she was 9. Women aren’t even fertile at 9 so don’t come at me with “people were different back then”.

Unlike Christianity which also had the biggest slave trade in the world, but whatever my feelings as a Chrisitian are hurt so I need a scapegoat. I know that Muhamed was a shitty person, but so were most of the Christian figures and leaders. Religion is irrational and causes people do to stupid shit no matter Christianity or Islam. You also love to forget that Christians spread their religion by the sword as well, but I guess you are biased so that doesn't matter.

Obviously no one knows the kind of trade deal the UK will have with the EU post Brexit - the tariffs may be low or there may be none at all, like the Canada deal. In my opinion, unless tariffs are high, Scotland would absolutely be better off in the SM&amp;CU - though even with high tariffs, there's an argument to be made that hitching our wagon to the EU, instead of an economically diminishing UK, would be better for us in the long term. I've been following reaction to Brexit on the island of Ireland and, let's face it, there's a growing chance the UK might not even contain Northern Ireland in a few years, so we'd be damaging our European and world trade (including our £5 billion a year whisky industry) for the sake of inner trade with just England and Wales. Maybe that is the better option short term, but I can't see that being good for our economy in the long run, though these are all things that will be fiercely debated. Obviously Ireland's trade is currently quite heavily tied to the UK (though Belgium, as I understand, is a bigger export market for you). If you had to choose between a deal with the UK at the (potential) expense of tariff free trade with the EU and the guaranteed loss all of all the deal's the EU has struck with other countries/trading blocs, what would you do? What do you think would be best for Ireland?

While you're here, can I just apologise for the absolutely atrocious arrogance and ignorance the UK is displaying towards your island. I had no idea people were so clueless about Irish history. I like to think people are just so uncomfortable and ashamed with Britain's role that they stick their heads in the sand, but when you see how unfathomably proud some people are of the British empire - the exploitation, the famine, the slavery, the genocide - you realise it's probably not that. I'm absolutely fed up to my back teeth of having to explain to my English family why the GFA is a delicate balancing act and why the border absolutely jeopardises that.

Here is TW:3k, a soon to be released aaa title.

https://steamdb.info/app/779340/
Indian Rupee	₹ 1999	$28.02 (cheapest at 28.02 usd) 
U.S. Dollar	$59.99 $59.99 (usd is the baseline) 
Euro	59,99€	$68.80 (EU price)

What higher consumer protection for games via steam does India lack and Euro have? No really, there could be some regulations so I wouldn't be surprised if there is a difference but I'm unaware.

Following that, EU price is 245% more expensive. Pray tell how paying more than twice the price actually is protecting the customer more. Is whatever higher level of consumer protection worth paying two and a half times more? For the same product byte by byte.


Myself, I remember WarCraft3 coming out many years ago and it was priced at about 30% my country minimum wage.
Using usa min wage as a baseline at uss7.25, its akin to newly release war3 (or a new aaa game) costing usd365.40 today (7.25 x 8hr x 21days *30%). So yes, lower pricing is a thing that is gonna break Epic if they dont do regional pricing.

unrasierterphilosoph,1523631665.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_16s79mtd,False,"The footsoldiers of the Wehrmacht were tough cookies (unlike the imperial stormtroopers, the ones of the FO are actually made of stronger stuff), and they had a couple of excellent generals.

But not only did they have ten stuffed uniforms for every really good one at least, Hitler overrode their decisions and forced them to do all kinds of useless and counterproductive stuff, in various situations for no other reason than to remind them that he was in charge.

I think you are wildly inaccurate about a whole lot of historical facts, but it's probably better not to get bogged down in a discussion that would probably turn too political soon.

I think it is worth remembering that the Resistance is not a real army though, and it was never capable nor supposed to fight and defeat the FO in a real war.

Strictly speaking they were a small paramilitary terrorist group, operating ouside of Republic law, trying to disturb operations of the FO on a small scale, to slow them down a bit, and at the same time finding proof of their plan to invade the Republic, to stirr the Republic up to make itself ready for battle, and give it some more time for preparation.

But is was not by itself a serious military threat in the eyes of the FO.

They had destroyed SKB, yes, but that did nothing to make them more of an opponent in a regular war.

Besides Hux's desire to punish them for that offense, the Resistance itself was relevant to Snoke only for two reasons, namely Leia and her status as a legendary hero and symbolic figure, and still more important, through her, the connection to Skywalker.

The Resistance is the equivalent of a small partisan group, not the french or much less soviet army.

Which reminds me that Hitler is on record saying that he hoped that there would be partisans and occasional uprisings for decades to come in conquered eastern europe, so that generations of german soldiers and officers would be able to gain combat experience and learn to be ""real men"" there, also of Moff Jejerrod in the original RotJ novelisation, who quite liked the Rebellion, likening it to a small boy he could torment to his heart's content, until the boy suddenly broke his chains, and suddenly the game was no longer fun.

That was by the way one of the many big blunders as well, that the Nazis were so insanely cruel and racist that they managed to turn even people who hated the Soviets with a burning passion against themselves.

Of course the Rebellion was also just a pretty small partisan movement, even if much larger and more widespread than the Resistance, but still, seeing as such movements have rarely achieved very much without massive outside assistance by a greater outside power, which was not the case with the rebels of course, the Empire being the only galactic super power, it was always very unrealistic that they won, much less the way it was portrayed.

But in the end the Nazis never had a real chance to win the war, because their opponents had many times the amount of human reserves, natural resources and industrial capacities, even capturing some russian oil fields would never have been enough to change that.

They had fine weapons, but only the resources and capacity to build and field a comparatively tiny amount of them, the Wehrmacht had far to little equipment from day one, and the german generals knew exactly that they would run out of pretty much everything very soon, but the fanatical ideologues were convinced that the Soviet System would quickly collapse like a house of cards. They were wrong, and the rest is history.

This is a problem that I suspect the FO will be confronted with as well.

I'm sorry, don't want to offend your father, but I cannot take anyone seriously who unironically uses the term ""emo"" the way you described.

But in any case, it is just factually wrong. Considering that Kylo could have quite easily killed Rey if he had chosen to do so, even in his severly weakened state, until the Cosmic Force intervened to give her a power boost, there is just no logical reason why he would not be able to beat her (and he almost certainly will, but spare her).

One is tempted to say that that is not how the Force, or even fighting in real life, works.

You are right that Kylo's position in the story is a bit murky, he is after all a character that is only in the process of fully coming into his own, after all.

Which among other things includes finding his own balance and realizing the full extent of his power.

Yes, I think he will almost certainly come down on the side of anti hero eventually, but that does not prevent him from acting as opponent as first, and mark my words, he will turn out to more dangerous than Snoke and Vader together.

We will follow his journey and his struggles, because the narrative will treat him not as an obstacle to Rey and co, but as the protagonist of his own story, even if on the oposing side, as TLJ as already started to do, something that will only be intensified in episode IX.

And that process of coming into his own of a Kylo eager to prove himself, will of course involve crushing various enemies into the ground (both inside and ourside the FO) and gaining increasing power, politically, militarily and in the Force, free of masters that belittled him and held him back.

But in the end, the tension will not primarily come from a fight scene.

After all, the confrontation between Luke and Vader in RotJ drew nothing of it's intensity from the question of who the better fighter was (though one could argue that Vader pretty much ""went down like a bitch""), and the Emperor died without much fanfare after Anakin Skywalker had won his much more significant internal struggle.

Kylo and Rey have been portrayed as equals in the Force, but at their strongest when they are on the same side, and it has been hinted that the Cosmic Force does not want them to kill each other, probably because there is something important that it wants them to do, that they can only achieve working together.

So while I think they will fight one more time, with probably Rey the aggressor and the one who wants to kill, and Kylo being the winner and the balanced one, in the end it will probably be more about finding a way to avoid and minimize the fighting and killing.

CreeperCooper,1409668403.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_i6v8v,False,"&gt; If she doesn't like being in this position then she should fucking resign. Nobody is making her.

&gt;She called an election to strengthen her majority and it failed. She should have resigned then.

Resigning wouldn't do her any favors, either. The hate she gets is unbelievable right now, wait till she 'abandons' her position. 

Who would replace her that would do a better job? Who would replace her that makes sure one side doesn't goes into a rage? Who would even WANT that job? No one. 

""This **candidate** ofcourse, the one that has *my* opinion!"", yes. Exactly... That's what everyone thinks.

She is not the prime minister you want, but she is most certainly the only one able to do the job. 

&gt;She revoked Article 50 without any plan whatsoever.

She was hated for waiting too long on invoking Article 50. Remember, the referendum results were announced **24 June, 2016**. Article 50 was invoked on **29 March 2017**.

Damned if you do, damned if you don't. You hate her for not taking enough time and form a plan (with a government divided and unwilling to make one at all!) and someone else hates her for taking too long to invoke the article (""We won the vote! Get on with it already! Traitor!""). 

Again, it doesn't matter what she does. The United Kingdom has a population of 66 million babies, all throwing a tantrum because they don't get it exactly how they want it, when they want it.

&gt;You say she is trying to please both remainers and leavers whereas the only people happy right now are people who want to see the EU fail? IE. Russia and America.

No one is happy in the UK, I never said that remainers and brexiteers were *happy*. I said she is trying to please both sides, which she has been doing with every step she makes. 

The Brits can't be made happy, they are British after all. 

&gt;You think democracy will be kept if we follow the advice from a non-binding referendum in which both sides cheated nearly two years ago now?

The referendum is 'non-binding' in a legal sense, not a political one. That's the entire problem with 'non-binding' referendums. The political parties can't ignore a referendum without being called out by everyone who voted leave. Going against the referendum vote would literally anger half of the UK and make sure their party crashes and burns. 

There is no such thing as a 'non-binding' referendum. The parties will have to act out the results anyway. Not because of legal reasons, but because they will (permanently) lose a majority of their voters. 

&gt;Do you know what democracy is?

Yes, I do. The people voted to leave, and the government will try anything they can to accomplish that wish so they will not be punished in the elections or get a sign with permanent marker: 'undemocratic' on their necks. 

Want to be angry about the result? Be angry at politicians who lied, be angry at the media for lying. Be angry at the masses of British adult babies voting the most stupendous option they had available. 

If you believed leaving was going to be a good choice at the time of the referendum, you might need to open your goddamn eyes. Anyone looking at the situation objectively in 2015/2016 would've been able to tell that leaving was dumb.

Don't be angry at May, she didn't want to leave in the first place.

J'ai le même modèle chez moi. Super médecin de manière générale, mais systématiquement en retard. J'ai tout tenté : prendre rendez-vous pour être le premier, pour être juste après l'heure de table, rien à faire. Tu as rendez vous à 14h, il te fait entrer a 14h45, les jours ou ça va bien. 

J'ai pris le pli, si je dois aller chez le médecin, j'y vais tout de même pour l'heure convenue - sait-on jamais - mais je prend mes dispositions : mon smartphone chargé, mes écouteurs, ou un livre. 

J'ai aussi pris conscience que je préférais un médecin systématiquement en retard qui prend le temps de bien faire/dire/expliquer que d'en avoir un qui expédie chaque patient pour ne pas prendre de retard.

&gt; Et c'est en partie le pourquoi d'être chez mon médecin aujourd'hui. Il y a des hauts, et des bas.

J'ai eu la même démarche il y a quelques mois. J'ai fini par trouver un équilibre en m'organisant mieux que précédemment. C'est un effort qui n'est pas toujours facile mais qui s'avère payant sur le moyen terme.

From your very post comment in this thread:

""Anti-zionism is the belief that **Jews do not have land ownership rights. It's one of the oldest versions of anti-semitism with a new name.**""

Is that not an argument that old Europeans were antisemities for not giving the Jews in Europe full rights to own lands? I.e. they were denied jus soli? Or did you just stumble on to that by accident? If so, look up the Jewish emancipation.

If the language has modern descendants or relatives, we can compare those languages to reconstruct the sound system of the ancient language. (For example, Proto-Indo-European is the common ancestor of most European and many south Asian languages. Although there are no written records, it has been reconstructed by comparing modern and knowm Ancient languages. It started a few centuries ago when people noticed that Latin, Ancient Greek, and Sanskrit are so similar they must be related.) Sometimes, we can look at words borrowed from a known language into an ancient language. This is how we know what Sumerian and Proto-Basque sounded like. Also, just looking at the writing system can tell you roughly how many sounds the language had, which is also helpful to know.

I don't know the specifics for Phoenician, but it has modern relatives such as Hebrew and Arabic, so those were probably good to look at.

My point is that only 2 (maybe 3) countries on the planet have complete single-payer primary care with no private options and the biggest are us and Taiwan. And we're not leading the world in healthcare. The UK, most of Europe, Australia, etc... all have either hybrid tiers or private options that still fund the public one. (The difference in USA is that private options do not fund the public ones, which is why the US approach to healthcare is so broken and expensive).

When you have private options it can take some of the load off the public system, and those using private options are still funding public healthcare. It can (and does in those examples) lead to improved healthcare for everyone - but I do admit it's still a moral issue of allowing different levels of access. However I think the pragmatic approach is best, and also it's important to define what can be done privately. There shouldn't be different levels of access for serious things/conditions. But something like waiting to see an ENT because I have a cyst or something. That already sucks, I had to wait 18 months to see one here, and if people who are rich pay extra to see one shorter, and in turn the public system has less load and things improve, I'm all for it.

Unfortunately in these kinds of discussions Canadians seem to refuse to look past the for profit examples in the US as if they're the only other approach than what we're currently doing. All they do is fear monger and we'll never go beyond our status quo of being near the bottom of all developed countries.

And for the record I am (usually) a NDP voter, I believe Canada should have universal pharmacare, dental care, visioncare, etc..., even that feminine hygeine products should be covered for low income people.

Trump würde ich jetzt alles zutrauen. Sind also noch UK und FR als wesentliche atomare Freunde übrig. UK verabschiedet sich aber momentan schon ein wenig von uns, wobei die Zusammenarbeit im verteidigungs- und sicherheitspolitischen Bereich hoffentlich erhalten bleibt. Mit Frankreich sieht es gut aus, aber Le Pen ist jetzt auch nicht ausgeschlossen, und wie es dann aussähe, weiß ich nicht.

Ich bin für weitere Zusammenarbeit bei der Verteidigung (auch mit Le Pen o.ä., und auch nach dem Brexit), aber wenn die andere Seite das nicht mehr möchte, stehen wir doof da. Daher wäre ich dafür, dass wir uns auch atomar bewaffnen. Gern so, dass die Waffen auch zusätzlich unter Kontrolle der EU stehen und somit garantiert auch zur Verteidigung Estlands oder Polens eingesetzt werden könnten.

\&gt; Of course we don't know exactly what would have happened 

Yes we do, Yes just like to maintain this false hope.  Here are some of requirements for membership of the EU.  I draw your attention to Criteria section, part 2; Government budget deficit.  It clearly states EU members annual deficit must not exceed 3% of GDP in the current year or for the 2 preceding years.

Here are Scotlands figures

[https://www.gov.scot/publications/government-expenditure-revenue-scotland-2017-18/](https://www.gov.scot/publications/government-expenditure-revenue-scotland-2017-18/)

See Table S.5 - Current budget balance.

In 2014 during the indyref, our budget deficit was running at -8.9%.  8.9 &gt; 3.  Even now, we're running at -6.8%.  We do not meet and have never came close to meeting the entry requirements for budget deficit because we spend more than we earn.  People lie, numbers don't.  Sturgeon may stand up and tell you it'll be fine, we'd be members, she'll negotiate it.  Just like May said it's fine, we'll negotiate a Brexit deal.

&amp;#x200B;

That's just one of the criteria, we don't pass multiple of them.  It's why they gloss over it with ""it'll be fine, we'll figure it out.  I'll get us membership"".  Aye, just like May promised to negotiate a good deal on Brexit.  When will we finally learn we can't vote based on empty promises.  Fact and figures should steer the country.

The only hope first time round was maybe, from the goodness of their heart, the EU would allow us a rolling membership due to being previous members with the UK.  However, Spain would likely piss all over that to try to not give Catalonia any ideas about Indy too.

""a **persistent organic pollutant** that is readily adsorbed to soils and sediments, which can act both as sinks and as **long-term sources of exposure** affecting organisms.""

""Because of its lipophilic properties, **DDT can bioaccumulate**, especially in predatory birds.""

""DDT is **toxic to a wide range of living organisms, including marine animals such as crayfish, daphnids, sea shrimp and many species of fish**.""

""In the United States, these chemicals were **detected in almost all human blood samples** tested by the Centers for Disease Control in 2005, though their levels have **sharply declined since most uses were banned.**""

""The chemical and its breakdown products DDE and DDD **caused** eggshell thinning and **population declines in multiple North American and European bird of prey species**.  
DDE-related eggshell thinning is **considered a major reason for the decline of the bald eagle, brown pelican, peregrine falcon and osprey.**""

[\[source: literally just wikipedia, it was that easy.\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDT#Environmental_impact)

---

Importantly, for those that don't care about the environment and have no understanding of the value of birds of prey to the larger ecosystem:  

""Although DDT is generally not toxic to human beings and was banned mainly for ecological reasons, **subsequent research has shown that exposure to DDT at amounts that would be needed in malaria control might cause preterm birth and early weaning, abrogating the benefit of reducing infant mortality** from malaria.""  
[\[source: The Lancet\]](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(05\)67182-6/fulltext)

""Indirect exposure of mothers through workers directly in contact with **DDT is associated with an increase in spontaneous abortions**""  
[\[source: Center for Reproductive Medicine\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3527168)

DDT/DDE is also an endocrine disruptor, and consequently associated with endocrine disorders. It is also considered carcinogenic.  
Its presence in breast milk is thus cause for concern.

&gt; They actually don't, because Egyptians are actually honest and say that Egypt is their homeland. I don't think you know what ""homeland"" means.

Because egyptians have better things to do, point is still standing: they had control over the land way before the jews formed a collective identity. And longer as well. They have a very good case to call it their homeland.

&gt; ""Zionist terrorists"" are Jews, and Jews are indigenous to Palestine. Unlike Arabs.

According to your own rhetoric, so arab jews are not indigenous? The jewish palestinians that married non-jewish palestinians are not indigenous (and their kids)?

I can't actually believe that you think people from europe have more claim to the land then people who actually lived their all their lives (or at least an equal claim). Jew or not.

&gt; Jews don't have the right of self-determination in their ancient homeland? Thanks for finally indicating the anti-Jewish rights nature of the pro-Palestine movement.

What does this mean?
So if present day other semitic tribes like the Jebusites, Amorites, Girgasites, Hivites, Arkites, Sinites, Arvadites, Zemarites, and the Hamathites were still alive (and not genocided or extinct) and for example they lived in america or europe they now could all go on a mass conquest to Palestine/Israel and declare that its their land? (Out of self determination).

Stop this victim complex act of making it all about the jews, when you know darn well that taking over land based on historical nonsense is ridicilous indepedent of the ethnicity of the people. Like I said earlier, 90% of the people would now suddenly have a claim to foreign land that they never have been to.

&gt; Poor poor Palestinians who started the war to drive the Jews into the sea and lost. If they hadn't started the war, they wouldn't have lost a single solitary thing. Palestine wasn't their land, it was British land, and before that it was Ottoman land. For the first time in centuries the Arabs could have self-determined in Palestine, but they threw it away because they, like you, would prefer Jews be denied self-determination than have self-determination themselves.

I mean the zionists started that war in every aspect possible when they decided to make 3% minority into a 32% of the entire population within less than 30 years, were actively terrorizing the people, stealing the land and then got 56% of the land in a unfair partition plan. Any people would've rejected that and defended themselves, there is absolutely zero reason for the majority of the inhabitants to give the bigger part of the land to a small minority + immigrants. I wouldn't call 'offering' 44% of the land to the majority any form of self determination, I would call it a big sham and a con deal, just like your founding father said by the way. And you guys call the UN biased? Biased in your favor yeah, lol.

&gt; I haven't murdered any children. Reported.

You called me an antisemite, denied the Nakba and other bs. Reported.

All 3 don’t rely on other countries for military: they are a part of NATO. They just don’t waste money on waging expensive wars. 


Yes, NATO with it's pathetic 2% GDP mandate is what's keeping them from needing to spend realistic amounts of money on their defense. 


&gt;Home ownership rates of Norway are at 83%. 77% of Icelanders. The US is comparable with Denmark at 63/64%. What are you talking about?

Sorry it's been quite some time since I last had this discussion. Got some figures jumbled. 

&gt;And car ownership is not a sign of wealth, but debt.

No. Car ownership is something which can be achieved with debt, but to state that people are too poor to buy cars and have to deal with staggering &gt;200% ""luxury"" taxes on cars but that's okay because they don't buy them on credit is a facile argument. 

&gt;Lastly, the very same OCED you use as an example for dispense income pitches Denmark as one of the happiest countries in the world. Is that a facile propaganda with an tends to push? If so, your own stats don’t hold up.

UnableFaithlessness,1535386132.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_22pv39zg,False,"&gt; I'm not comparing that. The population of the United States all came from groups that were assimilated into an American identity. There was no pre-existing American identity from which it emerged. Regularly large groups of people are taken in and assimilated.

There was a preexisting American identity: the post-British Empire Anglo identity. This eventually transitioned towards a ""white Christian"" identity and is currently transitioning towards something new. An empire can assimilate many small minority populations over generations; this takes a long time and small discrete minority groups.

&gt;The Yishuv had groups of people with almost nothing in common who had strong ethnic tensions between them. Russian Jews and Polish Jews fought. Lithuanian Jews had separate institutions which still exist. Yet within a few decades they had almost no distinctions. The Israeli identity is vastly stronger.

This is similar to the transition from the American Anglo identity to the white Christian one, which occurred due to the twin factors of (1) immense antiblack institutional racism and (2) significant German and other white European immigration during the 19th century.

Israel isn't a Mizrahi or Ashkie or whatever society. The different Jewish groups in Israel could not fully dominate any other; as such, it is a new kind of Jewish society. But the incorporation of a 40% Palestinian Arab minority *will* end the Jewish nature of Israel by this same process.

&gt;I've read the people around Rivlin Federal plan based on the Brazil model. I haven't read his confederation plan you are talking about.

[""Rivlin proposes Israeli-Palestinian ‘confederation’: President floats idea of two states with borders including land swaps, as well as separate parliaments, but only one army.""](https://www.timesofisrael.com/rivlin-proposes-israeli-palestinian-confederation/) Etc.

&gt;What happens if the first act of the Pennsylvania legislature is to dissolve itself into the wider New York legal system? The answer is it isn't possible. Pennsylvania doesn't have that power over New York. If it dissolves itself then it just becomes an unincorporated territory of the United States which means residents can't vote at the national level. That's all. These things can happen gradually so that the types of bad faith acts you propose are impossible or if they are done they are simply countermanded by a higher checking authority.

Sure, let's diminish Israel's sovereignty in the same way that American states have lost their sovereignty. What could possibly go wrong? It's not like the Supremacy Clause of the Federal government is a thing or anything. /s

You're still forgetting that all citizens of the US (whether they live in a state or a territory) have the Constitutionally guaranteed right to citizenship in any state depending on their residency. There is literally nothing stopping the entire population of any state (or unincorporated territory) from moving to another state to change that state's politics. [It's actively being advocated for in some circles.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_State_Project) 

""I would like to end Zionism and Jewish national self-determination because the whole world should look like America"" is ... insane. You're not advocating for a Zionist position. This is American anti-Zionism in its purest form.

&gt;States within the federal system don't have citizenship that's national. When it dissolves itself the residency laws are dissolved.

What does this statement even mean. The people born in an American unincorporated territory have federal citizenship.

&gt;You are ignoring the new aspects like the focus on economics. You are mixing the quotes freely together. The new attitudes are what's interesting. 

You are continuing to ignore that this new ""focus on economics"" is, in the 'new attitude', coterminous to their desire for Palestinian Arab dominance in a future state, and that Palestinian advocates for one single state see their economic integration as a step towards said domination. It's very explicit in the report.

I am not mixing quotes freely together. I quoted specific sections of the report that you are intentionally ignoring. 

&gt;I'm not advocating for a binational state. I don't support binationalism. I support assimilation. The grandchildren or great grandchildren of today's Palestinians are Hebrew speaking Jews.

&gt; Ariana Grande (born Ariana Grande-Butera, June 26, 1993 in Boca Raton, Florida, United States), is an American Grammy award-nominated actress, singer, and songwriter.

&gt; She was born to graphic designer Edward Butera and Joan Grande (the CEO of Hose-McCann Communications), Grande began singing and acting at an early age, appearing in local theater productions. In 2008, when she was 15 years old, she landed the role of Charlotte in the Broadway production of 13; her performance was well-received, winning a National Youth Theatre Association Award. Following an appearance in the 2010 Desmond Child-written musical Cuba Libre, Grande was cast as Cat Valentine in the Nickelodeon television program Victorious. The show ran until 2012, at which time Grande's Cat Valentine was spun off into a show called Sam &amp; Cat, which also starred Jennette McCurdy of iCarly.

&gt; As she kept herself busy with television, Grande began to pursue a musical career. She frequently made appearances at sporting events and with symphonies, and she made her first appearances on record via the soundtracks to Victorious. In 2011, she released the single ""Put Your Hearts Up,"" which was cut during sessions for a teen-oriented pop album; she later disowned the single due to its kiddie feel. Grande felt much more comfortable with ""The Way,"" her 2013 single featuring Mac Miller. This signaled a mature direction and audiences responded, taking it to the Top Ten in the U.S., where it was eventually certified triple platinum. It was the first single from her 2013 debut, Yours Truly, which also featured hits in ""Baby I"" and ""Right There.""

&gt; At the end of the year she released a seasonal EP called Christmas Kisses, but her real efforts went into the recording of her second album, My Everything. Preceded by the single ""Problem"" -- a song that featured a guest spot from Iggy Azalea, the ""it girl"" of the summer of 2014; it peaked at two on the U.S. charts and was certified double platinum -- the album featured a host of different producers, including Max Martin, Shellback, Ryan Tedder, and Benny Blanco. It was released at the end of August 2014, hitting number one on charts across the globe. Subsequent singles featured assists by Zedd (""Break Free""), Jessie J and Nicki Minaj (""Bang Bang""), and The Weeknd (""Love Me Harder""). At one point in 2014, three of her songs were in the Billboard Top Ten at the same time, a feat matched only be Adele. By the time fifth single ""One Last Time"" charted in early 2015, My Everything had sold nearly 600,000 copies.

&gt; As that album's cycle wound down, Grande guest-starred on Ryan Murphy's campy slasher series Scream Queens and she also recorded another holiday EP, Christmas &amp; Chill. In October 2015, Grande released the single ""Focus,"" which debuted at number seven on the Hot 100 and was certified platinum the following January. That February, she announced her third album, Dangerous Woman, and released the album's title track as a single in March. The song hit number eight on the Hot 100, making Grande the first artist to have the lead single from each of her first three albums debut in the Top Ten. Featuring collaborations with Macy Gray, Future, and Nicki Minaj, the album appeared in May 2016 and debuted at number two. It eventually went platinum, helped by a trio of Top Ten hits and a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album. Grande began 2017 by duetting with John Legend on ""Beauty and the Beast,"" the title track for Disney's live-action remake of their 1991 animated classic. She then mounted her Dangerous Woman Tour, performing across North America and Europe during the first half of 2017.

&gt; Tragedy struck on May 22, 2017, when a suicide bomber attacked Grande's concert at the Manchester Arena in Manchester, England. Grande returned to performing on June 4, when she held a star-studded charity concert called One Love Manchester to aid the victims of the bombing. Following the show, she resumed the Dangerous Woman Tour, which concluded in Hong Kong that September.

&gt; In April 2018, Grande kicked off promotion for her fourth album, Sweetener, by issuing the single ""No Tears Left to Cry,"" which debuted at number three on the Hot 100. She then collaborated with several other artists like Nicki Minaj and Troye Sivan before releasing Sweetener. She released the single ""Thank U, Next"" for her 5th studio album later that year in November. The single became Grande's first #1 on the Hot 100 subsequently, and also broke many streaming records.

CytheYounger,1476480354.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_124gtn,False,"&gt;So you're essentially saying human corruption and desire for power and all of the injustices that come with it are only attributable to an individualistic society and not a community-based one?

No, I'm not.

&gt;If that was the case, then individualistic societies would never have  been created in the first place. **And communism in all of it's examples  would have worked out.**

What are you talking about? Communism is quite literally based off of the village or tribe, small communities that owned their means of production, like commons. Complex and Nomadic foraging was basically the default mode of human social organization for most of of our history.

&gt;This is why Marxists argued that “primitive communism” was the original  form of property ownership, i.e. socialism. Historically, this is  correct. The problem was that this was predicated upon extended kinship  networks and not large, industrial, nation states, composed of  strangers. That is, *primitive communism does not scale*, which is why market economies came to supplant them over time.

There is a big difference between **Communitarianism** and **Collectivism.** The Communism you're thinking of, is industrial powered, centralized and Authoritarian. It's got the masses and the elites, it's Collectivist. That's not what I'm talking about.

&gt;All it takes is one influential individual with a lust for power and  control and you get what you have here today - regardless of the system  the individual was brought up in.

In our society yes, but that shit doesn't fly in certain tribal societies, who were fiercely egalitarian. You didn't become leader because you wanted to, you were followed. And if people chose to, they would simply stop following you if they didn't like it. If you wanted to lead a hunt, fine, but people only would follow you if you were considered a good hunter, not because you thought you were a good hunter. I mean look at the Big Man feast in complex foraging societies, that was all about status and power, but they achieved that by redistribution of resources, the Potlatch. And it could easily be taken away if they turned into selfish petty assholes. In Anthropology this is called leveling mechanisms.

Anyways I'm too lazy to write anymore so here's a good take down of the Pop Anthropology that gets bandied about when shit like this comes up.

&gt;At it’s heart, it is an attempt to “erase” or “rewrite” the past for  the sake of present circumstances. As one of it’s earliest descriptions [had it](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/retcon-history-and-meaning), *“retroactive continuity ultimately means that history flows fundamentally from the future into the past.”*  
&gt;  
&gt;What’s any of this got to do with history? It strikes me that much of  what we learn about history are attempts to “retcon” the past.  
&gt;  
&gt;What do I mean by this? It seems that history often adopts a “modern”  point of view to explain past events. In this narrative, we were always  heading to exactly where we are: globalized free-market corporate  monopoly capitalism. This is done to depict our present circumstances not  as deliberately engineered, or contingent on any historical  circumstances, or political choices, but rather as something “natural”  and just an expression of unchanging human nature. With this retconning,  we are unable to think of different ways of organizing things, because  those ways—even in the very recent past—have been retconed out of  history. Even things in recent living memory—such as not going into debt  for an education, or being able to afford a single family house on 25  percent of your income—are retconned to make it so that they never  happened.  
&gt;  
&gt;*2. The individual has always been the basic unit of social  organization. People have always thought of themselves primarily as  citizens of territorial nation-states (British, German, French,  Canadian, etc.) with well-defined borders. The* [*neolocal*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolocal_residence) *monogamous nuclear family is the only natural and logical form of human social organization.*  
&gt;  
&gt;None of these statements are true, of course. Such arrangements are  very contingent upon time and place and culture, and often very recent.  For most of human history, the nation-state did not exist. There is  nothing “natural” about it–it was created from above by oligarchic  elites, just like the One Big Market. They are artificial creations.  
&gt;  
&gt;And while families are, indeed, “natural,” the form they take varies  widely. Most families were extended, and consisted of many generations  living either on the same land or under the same roof, together with  agnatic relations. Who was or was not considered a part of the family  had to do with kinship structures, typically encoded into the language  and culture.  
&gt;  
&gt;Extended kinship networks were the primordial form of human social  organization (as Lewis Henry Moran discovered). Religion, too, played a  significant role, especially ancestor worship, collective rituals, and  food-sharing meals and feasts ([even bonobos do it](https://www.sapiens.org/evolution/bonobos-meal-sharing/)).  
&gt;  
&gt;This was the conclusion made by Henry Sumner Maine by studying  ancient legal structures and comparing to them to surviving village  communities in India, Java, North America, and elsewhere. He writes, *“We  have the strongest reason for thinking that property once belonged not  to individuals nor even to isolated families, but to larger societies  composed on the patriarchal model.”* Concerning private property, he concludes,  
&gt;  
&gt;“…\[P\]rivate property, in the shape in which we know it,  was chiefly formed by the gradual disentanglement of the separate rights  of individuals from the blended rights of a community. Our  studies…seemed to show us the Family expanding into the Agnatic group of  kinsmen, then the Agnatic group dissolving into separate households;  lastly the household supplanted by the individual; and it is now  suggested that each step in the change corresponds to an analogous  alteration in the nature of Ownership.”“…if it be true that far the most important passage in the history of  Private Property is its gradual elimination from the co-ownership of  kinsmen, then the great point of inquiry…what were the motives which  originally prompted men to hold together in the family union? To such a  question, Jurisprudence, unassisted by other sciences, is not competent  to give a reply. The fact can only be noted.” (p. 159)  
&gt;  
&gt;This is why Marxists argued that “primitive communism” was the  original form of property ownership, i.e. socialism. Historically, this  is correct. The problem was that this was predicated upon extended  kinship networks and not large, industrial, nation states, composed of  strangers. That is, *primitive communism does not scale*, which is why market economies came to supplant them over time.  
&gt;  
&gt;Regarding the “lone individual” posited by Classical Liberals as the  primordial atomic unit of society, this, too, is ahistorical. Like the  primitive barter economy, anthropology has failed to turn it up anywhere  it has looked for it:  
&gt;  
&gt;It is here that archaic law renders us one of the  greatest of its services, and fills up a gap which otherwise could have  only been bridged by conjecture. It is full, in all its provinces, of  the clearest indications that society in primitive times was not what it  is assumed to be at present, a collection of \*individuals\*. In fact,  and in the view of the men who composed it, it was an \*aggregation of  families\*. **The contrast may be most forcibly expressed by saying  that the \*unit\* of an ancient society was the Family, or a modern  society the individual.** We must be prepared to find in ancient law all the consequences of this difference.\[Archaic Law\] is so framed as to be adjusted to a system of small  independent corporations. It is therefore scanty, because it is  supplemented by the despotic commands of the heads of households. It is  ceremonious, because the transactions to which it pays regard resemble  international concerns much more than the quick play of intercourse  between individuals.**Above all…it takes a view of \*life\* wholly unlike any which appears in developed jurisprudence.**  Corporations never die, and accordingly primitive law considers the  entities with which it deals, i.e. the patriarchal or family groups, as  perpetual and inditinguishable…Ancient Law pp. 134-135  
&gt;  
&gt;Surveying continental Europe and much of the colonial world, French scholar Emile de Lavaleye came to the same conclusion:  
&gt;  
&gt;Originally the clan, or village, is the collective body  owning the soil ; later on, it is the family, which has all the  characteristics of a perpetual corporation. The father of the family is  merely the administrator of the patrimony: when he dies, he is replaced  by another administrator. There is no place for the testament, nor even  for individual succession…Such was also the law everywhere where these  communities have existed; and, probably, every nation has passed through  the system.  
&gt;  
&gt;The point of all this, of course, is not to advocate a rewind to the  past. Rather, it is to show us that social forms change over time; and  what may adaptive in one context (say, [Fordism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Fordism)), will not work in another (say, an information economy). Lavaleye points this out himself:  
&gt;  
&gt;“…the object of this book is not to advocate a return to  the primitive agrarian community; but to establish historically the  natural right of property as proclaimed by philosophers, as well as to  show that ownership has assumed very various forms, and is consequently  susceptible of progressive reform.”

Your parents and many others might be social ladder climbers, one could argue all generations do this, however that doesn’t mean that they believe in destroying the environment to do it. There are man social structures and ladders to climb.

To your first points. The current generation has been in an era of war, but not conscription. So unless like me you were a volunteer- or a family member, war was something distant and different. The previous 3 generations lived through wars where the draft was normal. Roughly 5600 died in Iraq and Afghanistan. The odds of knowing even one for an average American are quite low. I worked in the Wounded Warrior facility, I lost 3 friends on 9/11, my views and that of a person that was in school are very different.

But let’s not discount the impact war has on society. It changes us for sure. But my point in my long stated above is basically that life sucks. We however get to choose to sit back and bitch about it or to go and make it different. It was meant not to demean but to inspire - I used sarcasm to show the dichotomy between generations and maybe that is lost, but the point is the same. Life. Is. Hard.

That depends. While racism in Russia certainly works a bit differently then in America, and even if you are ""white"", you will be regarded as foreigner....

Since most of the white nationalist ideology has similar roots and similar ideologues that have been influencing each other ofr cneturies, Russian white nationalists share similar beliefs to Western white nationalists, more often then not

For example, a white American will have a lot easier time then black American, because white privilige is definately a thing in Eastern Europe.

In cazul budistilor, nu se aplica in totalitate contra-argumentele, doar o parte.

&gt;Ce parere ai despre faptul ca religia isi  schimba anumite reguli pe masura ce evoluam ca societate? De exemplu  actualul papa promoveaza o atitudine diferita fata de ce era in trecut  in privinta persoanelor gay, divort, avort, celibatul preotilor, etc.?  Nu e asta un semn ca etica si filosofia morala influenteaza religia si  nu invers?

Adaptarea o consider un must-have si cred ca trebuie chiar sa fie asa. Religia o consider ca un indrumator, nu ca un ghid complet asupra felului de a trai. Religia, in modul cum as dori sa fie de fapt, ar trebui sa sustina libertatea fiecarui individ in parte. Inainte, persoanele de culoare au fost date de cel de sus drept slujitori ai celor alesi. Dupa un timp s-a modificat. Persoanele LGBTQ+ erau destinate iadului, acum se modifica treaba, si ei sunt oameni si tot asa. Eu vad religia ca si un indrumator spre o viata morala care sa fie buna si acum si pe viitor iar asta fara adaptarea asupra mediului social si etic este imposibila.

&gt;Doar in cateva situatii, prin spovedanie.  Dar daca esti din categoria LGBT, membru al unei alte religii, faci  avort, divortezi, etc. atunci nu prea.

Asta este doar in cazul crestinismului/musulmanilor in principal. Budistii nu au o viziune asupra avortului, persoanelor LGBTQ+, divort. La iudaism este acceptat avortul/divortul in situatiile in care se considera ca este in folosul familiei/persoanelor. 

&gt;Eu percep religia mai degraba ca un factor  ce dezbina la nivel global. Si fiecare religie uneste membrii impotriva   membrilor altor religii, care sunt identificati ca ""dusman"" comun. La  ce scop comun te referi?

Acceptarea comuna. Viziunea mea asupra religiei este una idealista, nu una realista din pacate. Este adevarat, dar cu timpul religiile se pot uni pentru un scop comun. Din ce am observat (fara multa cercetare, din pacate, ca na, nu ma intereseaza asa mult religiile moderne acum), romano-catolicii incearca aceasta unire.

&gt;Presupun ca te referi la nunta si botez.  Partea religioasa ""pentru ca asa se face"" si o sa te critice rudele daca  nu le faci. Momentele astea s-au sarbatorit si se vor sarbatori  intotdeauna, cu sau fara nevoia de factorul religios.

Ma refer si la craciun, paste in principal, nu la petrecerile de nunta/botez. Nici eu nu le suport astea, nici nu ma gandesc sa le fac vreodata. Am copilarit intr-o familie mai plina de certuri si de probleme iar craciunul/pastele erau printre singurele momente cand chiar eram uniti si incercau toti sa fie buni fata de restul. Legat de sarbatorirea ocaziilor mentionate si ale altora, da, nu consider o necesitate.

&gt;Desi raportat la cati bani gestioneaza si cat ajuta, as zice ca ONG'urile ajuta mai mult.

True, si mare dreptate. Dar orice ajutor conteaza. Totodata, sunt biserici la care preotii trimit 80% din bani catre orfelinate si azile de batrani, un preot dintr-un sat din apropiere a cumparat un microbuz pentru ca copii din sat sa poata merge la scoala iar exemplele pot continua.

E adevarat ca s-ar putea mai bine, ca astea sunt o exceptie de la majoritatea care exista, mai ales in tara noastra, dar cand nici macar un ONG nu vine de ani buni, asta poate ajuta mai mult decat iti imaginezi.

Another antipsychotic, Geodon, was side effect friendly, but couldn't 100% cut the mustard at controlling my mania, and after 5 years it started giving me akathisia. 

The two Seroquels are the only antipsychotics that I have tried that gave me neither EPS or hyperprolactinemia. It, unlike a few antipsychotics I tried, can control/ease/prevent all of my bipolar symptoms fully under usual circumstances. It is also helpful for curbing my anxiety.

The two Seroquels have been both sedating and weight unfriendly in the past, but not as weight unfriendly as some other antipsychotics I've tried. Seroquel XR can be weight neutral for me at doses of 450 mg and below. Above that is a bit of a challenge, but my weight gain has not been extreme. Last spring and summer, I managed to lose 10 lbs while at 500 and 600 mg between April and the end of July (with a two-week European vacation in between), but have since regained the loss, plus four pounds because of the holidays, etc.

I found sedation harder on regular Seroquel than Seroquel XR mostly because I usually took regular Seroquel in the morning as well as at night.

These new pushes are to remove all limits including those that prevent a doctor from going through with an abortion if the baby is delivered.  

The United States has legal abortion.  There is already a common ground.  The ""women's rights"" claims are not to ensure the middle ground but to permit everything including infanticide.  As you can see in the videos, they don't hide this.

The game autosaves frequently, but you can also save manually in the menu.  Press + to open inventory, then press R to switch to system menu.  

Basic gameplay is walk around and kill stuff.  Complete shrines to increase your hearts and stamina, and complete divine beast quests to make the final boss weaker (you can go fight the final boss at any point).

You're right about gangrene not requiring an infection, but there's still a very plain association between the two, particularly in wet gangrene involving injuries. The Celsus model of understanding it would be open wounds &gt; exposure to water contaminated by other humans or sewage &gt; infection spreads within the wound.

Big business wasn't to blame, David Cameron was, he tried to solidify the power of the conservative government and silence his right wing by winning the vote, he really messed up!

 **""It should have been easy from the start. Leave, and work a plan for that scenario, instead of begging the EU oligarchs to give you an easy way out.""** \- That's just bad planning. We cant negotiate the trade deal with the EU until after we leave, as that would effectively be the EU negotiating with the EU. In the mean time why damage the potential GDP's or forecast growth of the countries you wish to trade with. We also have a massive trade deficit and 70% (circa) of our trade with the EU comes through the ports, you need something for that to keep going. Then there is people.

**"" I'd argue the single biggest reason why Britain should want to leave, is in order to leave the single market. Yet, for some reason, it's what paralament is trying to protect the most.

Once we leave we loose those trade deals and have to start again as a solo state trading in mostly services. No wonder parliament is trying to protect it. It will take circa 2 years to get a trade deal with the EU let alone the other countries, none of which have yet signed up. The US is sniffing around and the next thing we know, TTIP. Then there is standards etc.

EndTorture,1485260262.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_14qfjr,False,"&gt; unstable

When you use the personal attack ""unstable"" *YSK this is often used against TTI victims.*

- YSK calling someone ""unstable"" is also not an excuse to attack them or assume guilt about them.

- YSK (just like with the private TTI) the accused may be claiming they were innocent of the allegations.

  (ie, never were ""unstable."")


&gt; The only time schizophrenics are actually hospitalized in the US, is if they either have committed a violent crime, or if they are having an acute psychotic episode or have attempted suicide.

That's assuming guilt.  Really, just like the private TTI industry an abusive family member could just lie, so a parent can accuse a kid of a crime and without any actual evidence/conviction of the crime (and no real trial, eg with a defense attorney and conviction) the person can be locked up.


&gt; receive therapy while inpatient. 

The type of therapy in the USA is not the legitimate type I mentioned in Europe which leads to recovery.

*It's more like management of the drugs with the goal of keeping the person on the drugs as much as possible.*

Anyways, in the early 1990s psychiatrists still considered gays to be mentally ill, then trans people, and so on as morality changes.

We look back at that as totally wrong, and in not very long (as the USA slowly shifts towards the UK model of therapy) we will look back at the current system similarly in shock at how such a bad system could exist for so long.


&gt; and everybody who gets psychiatric drugs also gets therapy.

You're asserting without evidence, like they're facts, like I don't know lots of people who get psychiatric drugs and don't get therapy.


&gt; Literally nobody is just drugged until they're a vegetable and shoved into a room somewhere to be ignored; 

You're assuming this, but really practically all the long-term inmates (often innocent/unconvicted people) in these 'hospitals' are given a serious/scary sounding label and drugged for it.  To be clear, they are given ""major tranquilizers"" (aka ""anti psychotics"".)

They are (without any evidence/conviction) violently abducted, forcefully injected with tranquilizers, and locked up for as long as the psychiatrists want even if there is nothing but accusations made against them that never lead to conviction based on evidence.

Disease is the only thing directly affecting OP, if one exists. Her habits? Are these European romps weekly? Monthly? Yearly? Is she EVER going back to Europe again? We don't know. Likely not.

Personality? You hear one thing about someone's life and you can judge their personality from that? Or are you assuming a single lie damns someone forever? She's a liar for the rest of time now, right? How do you know if she was brought up conservative and just let everything go during this trip? It's not unheard of.

[Australian Federation of Aids organizations](http://www.afao.org.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/4528/BP0709_Circumcision.pdf) They state that circumcision has ""no role"" in the HIV epidemic.
The [German Association of Pediatricians](http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/10/10/14347482-german-cabinet-approves-controversial-circumcision-bill) called for a ban recently.

The [German Association of Child and Youth Doctors](http://www.kinderaerzte-im-netz.de/bvkj/kinpopup/psfile/pdf/70/121126_Ste50aa5e211e6a6.pdf) recently Attacked the AAP's claims, saying the benefits they claim, including HIV reduction, are ""questionable,"" and that ""Seen from the outside, **cultural bias reflecting the normality of non-therapeutic male circumcision in the US seems obvious, and the report’s conclusions are different from those reached by doctors in other parts of the Western world,** including Europe, Canada, and Australia."" (scroll to page 7 for the English translation.)

The AAP was recently attacked by the [President of the British Association of Paediatric Urologists](http://www.nature.com/news/doctors-back-circumcision-1.11296) because the evidence of benefit is weak, and they are promoting **""Irreversible mutilating surgery.""**

[The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Saskatchewan](http://www.cmaj.ca/content/167/5/532.2.full) has taken a position against it, saying it is harmful and will likely be considered illegal in the future, given the number of men who are angry that it was done to them and are becoming activists against it. 

The President of the Saskatchewan Medical Association has said the same (link above).

The [Central Union for Child Welfare](http://www.childcentre.info/10595/) “considers that circumcision of boys that violates the personal integrity of the boys is not acceptable unless it is done for medical reasons to treat an illness. The basis for the measures of a society must be an unconditional respect for the bodily integrity of an under-aged person… **Circumcision can only be allowed to independent major persons, both women and men, after it has been ascertained that the person in question wants it of his or her own free will and he or she has not been subjected to pressure.**”

[Royal College of Surgeons of England]( http://www.rcseng.ac.uk/publications/docs/male_circumcision.html) 
&gt;""The one absolute indication for circumcision is scarring of the opening of the foreskin making it non- retractable (pathological phimosis). This is unusual before five years of age.""...""The parents and, when competent, the child, must be made fully aware of the implications of this
operation as it is a non-reversible procedure."" |

[British Medical Association]( http://bma.org.uk/-/media/Files/PDFs/Practical%20advice%20at%20work/Ethics/Circumcision.pdf)
&gt; **it is now widely accepted, including by the BMA, that this surgical procedure has medical and psychological risks.** .... **very similar arguments are also used to try and justify very harmful cultural procedures, such as female genital mutilation or ritual scarification.** Furthermore, **the harm of denying a person the opportunity to choose not to be circumcised must also be taken into account, together with the damage that can be done to the individual’s relationship with his parents and the medical profession if he feels harmed by the procedure.** .... parental preference alone is **not sufficient justification for performing a surgical procedure on a child.** .... The BMA considers that **the evidence concerning health benefit from non-therapeutic circumcision is insufficient for this alone to be a justification for doing it.** |

[Australian Medical Association](http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/ama2/) Has a policy of discouraging it, ad says ""The Australian College of Paediatrics should **continue to discourage the practice of circumcision in newborns.**""

[Australian College of Paediatrics](http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/acp1996/): 
&gt;""The possibility that routine **circumcision may contravene human rights** has been raised because circumcision is performed on a minor and is **without proven medical benefit. Whether these legal concerns are valid will probably only be known if the matter is determined in a court of law** .....**Neonatal male circumcision has no medical indication.** It is a traumatic procedure performed without anaesthesia to **remove a normal and healthy prepuce.**""|

[Royal Australasian College of Physicians](http://www.racp.edu.au/index.cfm?objectid=65118B16-F145-8B74-236C86100E4E3E8E) 
&gt;Some men **strongly resent having been circumcised as infants. There has been increasing interest in this problem,** evidenced by the number of surgical and non-surgical techniques for recreation of the foreskin.|

ON that note, [74% of Australian doctors overall believe circumcision should not be offered, and 51% consider it abuse](http://www.australiandoctor.com.au/news/latest-news/strong-opposition-to-newborn-circumcision). Circumcision used to be common in Australia, but the movement against it spread faster there than America, where rates continue to drop.

A letter by the [South African Medical Association](http://www.icgi.org/Downloads/SAMA-NOCIRC-2011-06-25.pdf) said this:
&gt;The matter was discussed by the members of the Human Rights, Law &amp; Ethics Committee at their previous meeting and they agreed with the content of the letter by NOCIRC SA. The Committee stated that it was unethical and illegal to perform circumcision on infant boys in this instance. In particular, the Committee expressed serious concern that not enough scientifically-based evidence was available to confirm that circumcisions prevented HIV contraction and that the public at large was influenced by incorrect and misrepresented information. The Committee reiterated its view that it did not support circumcision to prevent HIV transmission.

This one is a detailed evaluation of the arguments in favor of circumcision, They note that during one of the recent trials in Africa, the researchers claimed there was no loss of sexual satisfaction, when in fact there was. But the RACS called them out: 
&gt;""**Despite uncircumcised men reporting greater sexual satisfaction, which was statistically significant,** Kigozi et al (2008) concluded that adult male circumcision does not adversely affect sexual satisfaction or clinically significant function in men."" In general, they discuss how there's no evidence to support it.

[The Norwegian Council of Medical Ethics](http://www.cirp.org/library/ethics/gulbrandsen1/) states that ritual circumcision of boys is not consistent with important principles of medical ethics, that it is without medical value, and should not be paid for with public funds.

The [Norwegian Children’s Ombudsman](http://www.crin.org/resources/infodetail.asp?id=25991) is opposed as well. 

The [Denmark National Council for Children is also opposed.](http://www.crin.org/violence/search/closeup.asp?infoID=19016)

And recently, the politically appointed Health minister of Norway opposed a ban on circumcision, yet [the ban was supported by the Norwegian Medical Association, the Norwegian Nurses Organization, the Norwegian Ombudsman for Children, and the University of Oslo.](http://www.thelocal.no/page/view/minister-says-no-to-circumcision-ban-)

Swedish Association for Sexuality Education published [this guide](http://www.rfsu.se/en/Engelska/About-rfsu/Resources/Publications/Dicktionary/) that talks about circumcision, in a pretty negative way. not an official advocacy policy but it makes it fairly clear. it also mentions the frenulum is sexually sensitive, and helps prevent infection by blocking fluid from the urethra; the frenulum is often removed in an infant circumcision, yet easier to leave intact if an adult is circumcised.

In ten chapters (covering Russia; China; the USA; Latin America; the Middle East; Africa; India and Pakistan; Europe; Japan and Korea; and the Arctic), using maps, essays and occasionally the personal experiences of the widely traveled author, Prisoners of Geography looks at the past, present and future to offer an essential insight into one of the major factors that determines world history.  


**Dream Cities: Seven Urban Ideas That Shape the World**\- Dream Cities explores our cities in a new way—as expressions of ideas, often conflicting, about how we should live, work, play, make, buy, and believe. It tells the stories of the real architects and thinkers whose imagined cities became the blueprints for the world we live in.

From the nineteenth century to today, what began as visionary concepts—sometimes utopian, sometimes outlandish, always controversial—were gradually adopted and constructed on a massive scale in cities around the world, from Dubai to Ulan Bator to London to Los Angeles. Wade Graham uses the lives of the pivotal dreamers behind these concepts, as well as their acolytes and antagonists, to deconstruct our urban landscapes—the houses, towers, civic centers, condominiums, shopping malls, boulevards, highways, and spaces in between—exposing the ideals and ideas embodied in each. Illustrated with 59 black-and-white photos throughout the text

**Beyond the Map: Unruly Enclaves, Ghostly Places, Emerging Lands and Our Search for New Utopias-** In Beyond the Map, Bonnett presents stories of the world’s most extraordinary spaces—many unmarked on any official map—all of which challenge our assumptions about what we know—or think we know—about our world. As cultural, religious, and political boundaries ebb and flow with each passing day and the messy maps of human and physical geography overwhelm us, traditional maps unravel and fragment. With the same adventurous spirit he effused in the acclaimed Unruly Places, Bonnett takes us to thirty-nine incredible places from around the globe that explore these changing boundaries and stimulate our geographical imagination. Some are tied to disruptive contemporary political turbulence, such as the rise of ISIL, Russia’s incursions into Ukraine, and the Brexit vote in the United Kingdom. Others explore the secret places not shown on Google Earth or reflect fast-changing landscapes. Natural processes such as hurricanes and rising sea levels continue to remake the world, as do human pollution and the relentless construction that destroys habitable land.

Beyond the Map journeys out into a world of mysterious, daunting, and magical spaces. It is a world of hidden cultures and ghostly memories; of uncountable new islands and curious stabs at paradise. From the phantom tunnels of the Tokyo subway to a stunning movie-set recreation of 1950s-era Moscow; from the caliphate of the Islamic State to virtual cybertopias—Beyond the Map serves as an imaginative guide to the farthest fringes of geography.

You can say a lot about socialism and it’s failures in the 20th century but that’s not one of them.

The reason why some communist countries had trouble with food are varied, some countries had famines before communism and had some after but generally the spread of communism improved people’s food intake drastically. Improving infrastructure and removing all of the famines that happened in China and Eastern Europe forever. 

With North Korea, it was a bit different. They really began to suffer when the ussr fell, for those that don’t know, the soviets and Chinese fell out so China went its own way, North Korea stayed very friendly with the ussr and received ample amounts of aid, so much so that like others have said, until the 80’s it was a better place to live than the south. When the ussr failed all that aid disappeared overnight, and so not even fiver years later, a country that was doing so well just a decade or two before found itself with an economic model that was based on aid and the only person that was giving it any had just left the show and so famine ensues.

montyprime,1537845697.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_2a7b4ye7,False,"&gt; but why would they be shipping so many cars to Europe and not doing any production for the US at all? 

Because they are going to delay US deliveries to make room for a initial burst of european and chinese deliveries.  Then presumably have a set production split between the markets which will change when the chinese factory opens.

As of now all that matters is that they are selling every car they make.  If customers are willing to wait for delivery, they can take advantage of that and ensure they sell 100% of their production.

Say they increase production to 10k a week for the model 3.  That would let them sell 5k in the US and 5k in china and europe.  But what if demand drops back down to 5k worldwide? 2019 is supposed to see a decrease in demand across the auto market.  They would have lost a ton of money expanding their production for a peak demand that wasn't sustainable.

If they keep production at 5k-6k and demand at those levels is sustainable, then they won't generate losses. The only downside is that customers will wait longer for delivery.

Tesla can survive having crappy service and longer delivery times as long as they are the only long range EV in town.  It is what it is and it would be silly not to take advantage of a market without competitors to protect yourself from losses. (argue all you want but none of the other EVs around $40k can charge fast enough to be considered long range and the US lacks a charging infrastructure for them).

&gt;means that unlimited demand is....very limited.

Unlimited demand is really just sustainable demand that you know you will get each week going forward with no stop date in sight.  They may have unlimited demand at 5k a week for the foreseeable future(many car companies enjoy this with even much higher weekly numbers).   That doesn't mean they can produce 10k a week, it means as long as they stick to 5k they won't have to halt production lines and lose money on investments in production.

We are just getting into a nuance about words even though it is clear what is going on.  I think musk just wants to indicate they have no reason to believe the 5k a week cannot be fully sold.

From what I understand (for if the player has not been signed to a contract). If the player is an international under contract overseas, the team retains the right for one year after that contract ends and if they're not under contract, the team retains their rights for one year and then the player will have to enter one more draft essentially wasting 2 years.

If the player is under contract, a standard contract agreed on in the CBA means players are supposed to demonstrate sportsmanship and not damage the image of the team (which refusing to play does). The contract will give the team the right to not pay him or sue him for breaching his contract. Injuries however, give the players the right to refuse if they are diagnosed by team doctors.

The young Maharaja Piyush was a kind and charitable man, and soon after his coronation he [converted from Hindu to the pacifist Jain faith](https://i.imgur.com/339Hbac.jpg). At the time, most of the nobility was Hindu but about half of the realm's subjects were Jain. Piyush's family and several of his vassals also converted at his request. Meanwhile, his Hindu vassal Rajas continued their wars of expansion and the [kingdom's borders reached the east coast of the subcontinent](https://i.imgur.com/3uUlYcD.jpg). 

As India's most eligible bachelor, Piyush had many potential brides to choose from. After a lengthy search, [he married the beautiful young princess Maya of the Licchavi Raj](https://i.imgur.com/o5NKWRQ.jpg) to the north. (Maya's in-game portrait is not that flattering but she has the ""attractive"" trait which makes her significantly more liked by men.) Piyush married for love; not only was Maya the fairest of them all, she also shared many of Piyush's virtues. He had little to gain from an alliance with the Licchavi Raj, and to the disapproval of his Hindu vassals, she was a member of the wrong caste. (In the game, Jains allow inter-caste marriages but Hindus don't; I assume this reflects religious values of the time.) Not wanting religious differences to pull apart the kingdom, Piyush set out to peacefully convert the rest of the nobility to Jainism by using diplomacy to persuade vassals with a favorable opinion of him, and sending priests to convert the rest.

In 800 AD, the [Viking age began in the game](https://i.imgur.com/zl31RAy.jpg), which modifies stats for Norse characters and begins a period of turmoil in western Europe. Maharaja Piyush's appropriately scripted response: ""I do not see how this concerns us."" lol

CarlTheFarmer,1528678191.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_dt3g98,False,"If you mean deeper meaning, then not always. But, they mostly aren't just ""normal names"" - they are almost always a reference to something, or something SIU came up with. I'll stick to the irregulars only, since listing everything is too much.

Confirmed is: ""Viole"" from ""violet"" - prolly because he is wearing violet when he is first introduced, ""Khun"", should be ""Kun"" and is from ""Sergio Kun Aguero"", a footballer. ""Urek"" is from the korean word for rockfish - because, acording to SIU, he's gray. ""Mazino"" is from the Maginot line.

Stuff that hasn't been stated but I'm confident in presuming(although I don't speak Korean - names can be easy to decipher):

""Arie"" should be ""Arieh"", which is a Hebrew name meaning lion, and Hon in Korean means spirit, ghost. So, literaly it's ""lion spirit"" - refering to the sword style. ""Ari Han"" is named in a way to express similarity to this(since they are related).

""Arlen"" is a name meaning oath, pledge - refering to the use of spells.

""Ha"" could be explained by [this](https://www.ancestry.com/name-origin?surname=ha), since the clan branches into two(assuming the info is trustworthy). Yurin means something like violate in Korean, which is due to her agressive nature.

""Gustang"" is from ""Ford Mustang"", because he is suposed to be the American idea of a gentleman, elegance, etc.

""Yeon"" means ""lotus flower""(among other things) in Korean, which could refer to the Zygaena emblem Ehwa always wears. Hana means something like elegant, graceful in Korean(or atleast is the root for words that do), which is due to her gentle personality.

""Eurasia"" is the landmass consisting of Europe and Asia(although the significance is unclear), and ""Blossom"" is probably reference to her liking to wear flamboyant clothes.

keystorm,1374477808.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_cgvdq,False,"&gt;	In 2017, following the referendum crisis of October, the Spanish government forced Catalonia into regional elections. The PDeCat ran a joint ticket with ERC - partly in fear of making their own weakness apparent - which thereafter only managed to make the ERC realise that their support of the CDC’s mishaps (in the form of running with Puigdemont for the presidency) has become more a liability than an advantage. Once again, the CUP refused to run along; which combined with their great growth in votes, has made regional parliamentary politics ever more chaotic and fruitless.

Nope. The joint ticket was Mas’ and Junqueras’ from 2015 called Junts pel Sí, only CUP refused to join; who utlimately forces the rwmocal of Mas and the inauguration of an unknown Carles Puigdemont. They succeeded and had a combined majority which allowed to organise the 2017 referendum, unopposed in parliament.

However, after the referendum and the detention of the soon to become political prisoners, ERC refused to run a joint ticket with PDeCat this time around; Junqueras being in prison and Puigdemont in exile. A whiff of treason reached the ERC lines (even though it is still unknown whether they all knew each other’s intentions) and they thought they could play the martyr card during campaing, while Puigdemont, from Belgium, still had to decide if he was going full on with PDeCat or he’d just try to cover the name under yet another coalition. He finally created a new umbrella called Junts per Catalunya and they finally beat ERC in the forced elections (forced by a more than dubious application if the constitution art. 155), achieving yet again a parliamentary majority in favour of independence.

The Junts x Catalunya ticket was formed by several members of a new generation of PDeCat, but also by the minority party Reagrupament and several other unaligned candidates. Oddly enough, Reagrupament is a small party that split from ERC several years ago. They were a harder branch seeking unilateral independence at any cost. Torra was a member of that party, before being sucked into JxCat. So Torra is neither a leader nor a member of PDeCat. He’s head of a government formed by a mixed cabinet of PDeCat and ERC, who are now competing against each other in European and municipal elections. smh

Puigdemont is still part of PDeCat, but has since refused to be a part of its leadership and instead runs rogue in Belgium. ERC refused to swear him in alleging presidents cannot be inaugurated unless defending their candidacy in the parliament, in person (ERC’s own candidate Companys was sworn in by telegram some 80 years ago, but that’s a story for another time).

It would seem however that, while “Crida Nacional per la República” a brand new party seeking to finally crystallise what JxCat intended to become (a brand that was stolen by PDeCat from under Puigdemont’s nose, but again that’s a story for another time), ERC has taken it upon itself to become the opportunistic pragmatical center-left party not too much inspired by independence. Flirting with Podemos and Comuns, left parties. Both are unaligned in regards of independence, but are timidly for an official referendum they know is indefensible in Madrid.

PDeCat has no other choice but to be completely absorbed by Crida. They might not survive the blow if they don’t follow president Puigdemont, blindly. This doesn’t mean Crida is neceassarily liberal center-right, but with the radical opposition of ERC (which is strategical rather than political) the leftist forces inside Crida are rather weak. Their manifesto is mainly realpolitik in pursuit of independence, though.

Some say ERC has abandoned its pursuit for the Catalan independence, some other think they just want to broaden its supports while trying to allure less invested independentists or turning to  those supporting Catalan’s right to self-determination, but less clearly about independence. Some even say they are just playing the sheep and try to win over more votes from the loyalist side by moderating their speech.

Then there’s Primàries, a new party lead by the non-partisan, former philosophy professor at Princeton Jordi Graupera. It’s a party that roots in radical democratic participation. The ticket is decided by a series of voting, and anyone can join. The prospects are unclear, but they seek to declare unilateral independence and are campaigning fiercely against both ERC and PDeCat/Crida (smh...). They only run in the bigger cities, and don’t run for the European elections at all.

All in all, pro-independence politics has become more sparse and atomised: 

-	Many leftists and rightists still stand behind Puigdemont, after all it was he who took it upon himself to organise and take the full responsibility for the referendum. Never in recent history had Catalonia been so close to independence. hia determination back then seems a proof of further action.
-	Many support how Junqueras will represent them in an ultimate trial to prove that Spain is not a state of right, but an autoritarian, repressive and undemocratic state. Many ”new” independentists (after the police brutality in 2017) feel confortable with this approach. He is a simple, generous, peaceful and traditional man who embodies the concept of innocence. Him being jailed is just a time bomb for Spain.
-	Many feel betrayed by both of them because they consider the referendum was won and the leaders did not apply the results as they should. They are instead just playing power games instead of doing realpolitik in favour of independence. They see in Graupera and his new vision a breath of air and a new bet for courage to finally break free from Spain, whatever the cost at this point.",True,False,False,,0,1549062294,,1549066438,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",efk0aoj,False,t3_alq6c0,True,t1_efgg2ii,/r/catalunya/comments/alq6c0/questions_about_catalan_political_parties/efk0aoj/,False,,1553410174,3,True,False,catalunya,t5_2s049,r/catalunya,public,,

HaricotsDeLiam,1518656498.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_x3bc9ln,False,"&gt;Why is this,

Wiktionary shows *light* as in ""bright"" as coming from a different PIE root than *light* as in ""lightweight"". The former comes from [PIE \*lewk-](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/lewk-) meaning ""bright"" or ""to shine"", and from this we get a ton of other cognate nouns and adjectives such as Latin *lux* ""light"", German *licht* ""light"", Russian луч *luč* ""ray"", and Greek λευκός *leukós* ""white \[figuratively\], blank, clean"" (can also mean ""white person""). Meanwhile, the latter comes from [PIE \*h₁lengʷʰ-](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/h%E2%82%81leng%CA%B7%CA%B0-), and from this we get cognates like German *leicht* ""light, easy, low-calorie, slight""; Albanian *lehtë* (similar to German); and Sanskrit लघु *laghú* ""light, nimble, easy, healthy, short, young, clean, soft, \[etc.\]"".

&gt;and does the relationship hold in other languages?

Some but not all. Here are some languages (both IE and non-IE) where the terms differ

&gt; # [Presidente de Colombia prevé caída de la ""dictadura"" venezolana en pocas horas](https://www.americaeconomia.com/politica-sociedad/politica/380)
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt; **Bogotá**. A la dictadura de Venezuela le quedan pocas horas, dijo este viernes el presidente de Colombia, Iván Duque, quien pidió estrechar el cerco diplomático contra Nicolás Maduro para facilitar el regreso de la democracia al país petrolero.
&gt; 
&gt; Colombia, que es parte del Grupo de Lima, reconoció al líder opositor Juan Guaidó como presidente interino de Venezuela.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Hoy es digno de aplaudir lo que está viendo el mundo y es que a la dictadura de Venezuela le quedan muy pocas horas, porque hay un nuevo régimen institucional que se está creando gracias al trabajo que ha jugado Colombia y otros países"", sostuvo Duque en un acto de gobierno, en el departamento del Huila, al suroeste del país.
&gt; 
&gt; Si bien Guaidó tiene el respaldo de Estados Unidos y los gobiernos de la Unión Europea probablemente lo reconocerán, Maduro sigue aferrado al poder con el respaldo de la cúpula militar, además de Rusia y China, en medio de la agudización de la lucha por el poder en el país petrolero.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Yo espero que en los próximos días el cerco diplomático continué"", dijo Duque, al insistir en unas elecciones libres en Venezuela como parte de un proceso de transición para recuperar la democracia.
&gt; 
&gt; Colombia se ha convertido en el principal destino de más de un tercio de los tres millones de venezolanos que abandonaron su país huyendo de la crisis.

Claiming that anyone is against essential resources being stripped from our country for next to no value because of xenophobia or emotional responses is ludicrous.

It's very simple to explain: we live in NZ, not any other country. We need certain resources to survive. If another country takes our resources then our survival is threatened. 


Historically, this is very similar to the Europeans coming into NZ. They paid off a very small group of native people so they could appropriate vital resources (land). Fast forward 150 years or so and the native people sit at the bottom of most statistics. 

Similarly, people have clearly either been paid off, or influenced to bring about the current legislative mire we have found ourselves in.

[deleted],,,,,,,dark,,,,"&gt; It's less than perfect here in the UK but everyone is going in the same direction

How is the US going in that direction?

&gt;You have a right to self defence here but the right to bear arms isn't a right in almost anywhere except the US and funnily enough there is pretty much zero requirement to be armed for self defence here. 

Rights are not granted by government. You inherently have them as a human. So yes, the UK *does* have the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, but your government fails to respect it.

As for self defense specifically, it is far more restricted in the UK. For example, what you are allowed to do when a burglar enters your home.

&gt;What taxes are obscenely high? I pay 31% on my income and that includes a hell of a lot more for my money than the US will. 

Personal income and VAT/sales taxes, for starters. Highest income tax bracket in the UK is 45% (46% in Scotland), highest (federal) tax bracket in the US is 37%. VAT for most goods in the UK is 20%, sales taxes in the US vary by state from a max of 7.25% in California to 0% in others.

&gt;Certain parts are but the majority of the country isn't.

Where is it not?

&gt;Can you elaborate on this?

Much of the UK lacks things which (should be) considered basic necessities in a first world country. Like air conditioning. [Hopefully](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_European_heat_wave) that never bites you in the [ass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_European_heat_wave).

&gt;America also has a rigid class system, you may be blind to it but it's true. Social mobility is greater in the UK than in the US

[Nope.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/The_Great_Gatsby_Curve.png)

We also (for the most part) do not force people to wear a uniform for the first 18 years of their life. I guess we are just not as obsessed with comparing classes.

&gt;Don't disagree but don't see how that corresponds to 3rd world countries.

I didn't say it did, but you asked what makes the UK so bad.

&gt;Don't really get this as a reason to not live here. The US isn't particularly great at this either

Because I don't like being around people who are apologetic about crimes against humanity. I have a friend from India, and there's a reason he doesn't have much nice to say about your country.

 In what way is the US bad about this?

Fresherty,1350751605.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_9d138,False,"&gt; How often is it that you can't predict when and where you will need something? 

Personally I can't. I'm MD and, among other things, part of my job are home visits which sometimes come at moments notice. That means I have basic kit of ""stuff"" including laptop and mobile printer in a trunk of a car. With tradesmen I'd imagine similar principle applies, although more along the line of them needing tools in place A and going with said tools to place B where those are needed without delay.

&gt;I'm assuming the courier car services would not need standard cars, but be vehicles built for this type of purpose. Yes, you'd need to make sure you get the right size storage.

That's kinda the point I'm making with issues of delay. Courier services (could) work efficiently because they drop off ""stuff"" along the pre-planned route. If I'm at place H (home) and need the same box at places A, B and C in relatively rapid succession it's going to be a problem. If on top of that I can't really realibly predict exact times I'll need it at A, B and C so the worse. It would mean there has to be pool of ready-to-go carriers pre-positioned around the city. What's even worse is quite often the times I need stuff moved might be exactly the same time some other people want their stuff moved (which I'll get back to a bit later).

&gt;With that said, I think you're heavily underestimating the influence of big city and non-American lifestyles.

I live in big city (well, in TOP50 by population) in Europe, and quite honestly looking from my own POV, as well as people I know and interact with (which come from ALL kind of backgrounds mind you) I still don't see it happening.

&gt;It's already cost-prohibitive in many big cities if you are being frugal.

Really depends on a city, your use and how you value your time... Big part of why it's cost-prohibitive is because of subsidies. Vast majority of public transit systems are ran at significant loss, and money to cover it comes from - you guessed it - car owners via taxation and things like parking rates. The less cars there are, the more expensive public transport will be and at some point you'll run into the issue of costs... and you can't increase cost of public transport because that in turn would reduce mobility those on bottom of wealth scale, which in turn will completely mess up basically everything... and we'll run into topic of taxation etc., and that's massive discussion in itself.

&gt; These types of services - if they can be more cost effective than public transportation - will flourish there.

As supplement to existing public transport network, sure. As replacement? Not really. There are several fundamental issues here that really need to be covered. First, people who use cars here generally speaking need them for good reason. Some of those reasons will be covered within the 'car as a service' system, sure, but quite a few will not. Second, car as a service will really not be that much more efficient. That's what I mentioned again - people generally speaking want to move stuff and themselves around at specific times. That's why you have rush hours in the morning and afternoon. Replacing that with a service will decrease number of cars (assuming we keep buses), but it will not be dramatic decrease simply because amount of people 1 car can serve to get from ""we work here"" area to ""I live here"" area will not be significantly higher than 1. Depending on exact layout of a city and general habits that can obviously change a bit, but for most time you'll end up with massive amount of cars being parked somewhere anyways, just like you do today, and in the end of such ""total replacement"" service might end up being so close to owning a car that with additional issues it brings it turns out to be unpractical.

&gt;I'm talking about how many European and Asian countries are comparatively smaller, and many people go without cars anyway. 

The thing about European-style cities is I really don't need a car for anything else other than going to various workplaces, and that applies to most people. Everything I need daily is within at worst 100 meters from my apartment and that again applies to every semi-urban area here. Groceries? Multiple supermarkets and small convienience stores. Fitness? There are two fitness centers I literally see from my windows I can go to, and probably more within the distance I mentioned. There's swimming pool next to school again around 100 meters from where I live. There's bunch of specialist stores around as well, variety of affordable restaurants etc. Only reason for me to actually go to city center other than work is to meet someone in a pub, go to a theater or for fine dining etc.

To put it simply the trick is not to add a service that makes people go around, it's to stop people from going around in first place. That's why I think the future is telecommuting for those that can do it, focusing on delivery services and other ways to keep people in homes.

&gt;Yes, but these are details that can and will be worked out.

That's lovely stance but again, how would you want to solve the issue of ""we have 1 million people that we need to move around at EXACTLY SAME TIME"" without violating fundamental freedoms and literally forcing them to stagger travel times? That's basically what we're trying to do for what, 70 years now? And yet we still have rush hours, we still have traffic jams and so on.

&gt;Once you're an established company in the big city you pay analysts to figure out the questions you are asking using the data you've already collected on a big city.

Again lovely idea... Except data you get from City A will not apply to City B 100 km away that's the same size, except different culturaly. It will surely not apply to smaller city because oh surprise people's daily routine you need to work around (or attempt to influence) is completely different. Issue here is something so fundamental as mobility is really REALLY hard nut to crack for many reasons, and people are and will be resistant to the very concept. I mean, hell, thing like Uber is functionally a taxi in a way you interact with it and yet there's massive resistance to the very notion here.

&gt;Which is why the service will come to where it is dense enough to support it and won't move until it is not.

IMHO it simply will not move out at all... and you can expect a lot of self-driving cars being devastated ""in protest"" by taxi drivers.

&gt;Cars by definition are mobile, it'll be very hard for a single company to ""own"" a town

Lets say you have a town A. To properly service the town using self-driving cars you need infrastructure: automated charging stations (or manual ones + labour cost, I'm assuming we're going electric here), vehicle maintenece facilities, vehicle storage facilities and some initial pool of vehicles to start working service with. For the sake of discussion lets assume you don't need to park your vehicles during operation, you just keep driving in circles, so there's no need for anything like taxi stops. What happens? Well first of all you get massive resistance from taxi drivers, so you'll need to somehow make your service better... and realistically only thing you can compete with is cost, assuming you maintain same availability of a service, responsiveness etc. which means you really can't start with 5 cars, you need much more (depending on size of a population). Alternatively you can be a taxi company itself and try to wiggle your way via replacing the inventory successively. Lets assume you successfully do that, now you have a service that works in a city and you removed taxis. Now you need to lower your costs to start expanding and compete with normal cars, so you expand your system, introduce more cars etc. and successfully start your regular service, everyone is happy!

Except you're company A in town A. What's the issue here? Well, the issue here is there's absolutely no incentive for company B to also enter town A at the same time. Barrier of entry is too high, and realistically nobody will gain from that. What will happen is company B will enter town B. Basically what you'll end up with is a system similar to how USA cable TV market works... except the ""internet"" provided by company A is not compatible with internet from company ""B"", so idea of getting automated car and going from town A to B will be impossible, because company A will not have practical access to town B, and company B to town A... unless you force some standards and allow interchangability of vehicles between those companies. Or even better, create a monopoly. First option will require government intervention, and that realistically will force subsidies... and that's quite honestly best option. Second option is terrifying because the monopoly means we'll be absolutely shafted with pricing, and you'll put something as essential as transport in hands of private monopoly. And no, that's not something we already have - mega-corporation of today provide some relatively important services, but something like transportation is critical. Think ""it stops working for a couple days and society collapses"" critical. 

Alternative option is government monopoly, and quite honestly I can see that happening as extension of already existing public transport networks here.

Oh, and the thing I mentioned before - pricing. R&amp;D and adoption costs are massive issue. All companies that dabble in automation are well north of $1 bn. in red so far, and that's just making the damn thing work on small scale. That number will increase exponentially from now on because vehicles themselves will be expensive and very likely to be initially unreliable, local infrastructure needs to be built, and as I mentioned before you need to compete on price in already very competitive market. All those costs will be eventually moved on people using the system, and there's only so much money investors will want to pump until they want to see some return.",True,False,False,,0,1549067223,,1549067710,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",efk67bn,False,t3_am2056,True,t1_efk17n9,/r/science/comments/am2056/selfdriving_cars_will_cruise_to_avoid_paying_to/efk67bn/,False,,1553412920,1,True,False,science,t5_mouw,r/science,public,,

europeanhousesparrow,1536356388.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_25uade7e,False,"(Long) Story time! Technically this is neither a disappointment nor a success for me, but it's been such a ride that I just have to share.  
Sometime in early December, I applied to a public sector position in a company owned by the provincial government. It was the usual ""upload your resume, then type it out again three times"" platform deal. There was an area for expected salary, which was annoyingly required. Usually, I'll leave it empty if I'm able; if it validates for any type of content, I'm a fan of ""TBD"". Unfortunately, it was unexpectedly efficient and wanted a number. 

HERE'S WHERE I FUCKED UP. I put in a number that I figured was low enough not to get the application tossed out immediately, but close enough to the general range of my current salary that we could bang it out later in a screening call. Oddly, salary was not disclosed in the job description, which is usually required for a government position, as I understand it.

I heard nothing in the following weeks so I figured RIP and moved on.

Early in January, on the Friday before I was set to return to work after a two-week holiday, I get a call from an unknown number. I ignore it and let it go to voicemail, because of who I am as a person. Turns out it's the government company, and can I come in first thing Monday morning for an interview? 

I decide I'll respond over the weekend as I was busy doing other things. Then I get an email from the same HR rep, letting me know that my interview was at 11am on Monday. Wow, OK. Then she calls AGAIN. This is all in the span of two hours. 

Over the weekend I shoot her an email to let her know that while it probably wouldn't be appropriate for me to ditch work the morning of my first day back for an interview (worded it a little differently, obviously), I'd be eager to come in later in the week if they can accommodate. 

I hear back and we set something up for Wednesday. Keep in mind that I have not had so much as a phone screen yet; this will become important. But I figure, government agency, probably a little old-fashioned.

I go in for the interview. The building is old and decrepit; the unionized receptionist is super salty. I too, am salty. The woman from HR is late; something something subway trouble.

Anyway, I go in for this interview. It's a panel interview with three individuals, one of whom being the hiring manager. Somehow, I hit it out of the park. The role does sound pretty interesting. Hiring manager and I seem to have a good rapport. 

Afterwards, HR woman leads me back out of the secure area and into the lobby to wait for an elevator back down to the ground floor and exit. I press the button. I wait for about five minutes. There is no elevator. I see a sign that says ""Elevator maintenance on \[date\]."" The date is not today, but this is the government. The elevators are not working, and there are no stairs. I cannot get back into the offices as they're passcard-protected. I am trapped in the lobby.

But wait! Here is the hiring manager from the interview! Thank God! He opens the door and pokes his head into the lobby. ""Hello!"" I say. ""The elevators are not working and I am stuck in the lobby!""

""Ha ha!"" he replies jovially. ""Oh no, I am late for a meeting with my boss!"" And he closes the door and walks down the hallway, out of sight.

After about another five minutes, I email the HR rep about my predicament. Thankfully, she comes and scans me in so that I can take a nearby stairwell and make my escape.

But wait! It gets better!

About a week later, I get an email from the HR rep saying they'd like to move to the ""next step"", which is, apparently, a background and reference check. It seems highly unusual that they would spend money on such a thing before an offer is even mentioned, but whatever, I have nothing to hide. I give them the details they need and figure it will be at least a couple of weeks before I hear anything else, since background checks can take a while.

But no! After less than a week, the hiring manager calls and is happy to tell me that I have the position! Only now are all details revealed, including a salary that's $15k lower than my current, along with a mandatory pension that will siphon off an additional 10%. Plus! This offer is at the END of the salary range, which means there is NO room for annual raises unless I apply for and receive a higher internal position. Exciting!

Anyway, I keep it positive and tell him that it's very exciting news; I have a few concerns about the salary, but I'll reach out to the HR rep about it when she emails me the offer.

Only I do not get an offer. I get an email with the subject line ""WELCOME TO \[GOVERNMENT AGENCY\]"". There is no offer letter inside, nothing to sign, no mention even of salary enclosed. Just a bunch of brochures about the pension and health benefits along with the code of conduct and instructions to swing by with my passport and a blank cheque within two weeks.

This is fun. I sit on it for a day, then email back a counter-offer, hoping to clear things up: ""Dear XXX, thank you very much for this OFFER, I am very excited to CONSIDER this OFFER...""

Now, admittedly, the counter-offer was quite aggressive. The tone was professional enough, but I asked for the world, and keep in mind that at this point, I was 100% ready to walk away. I had already 99.9% decided that this wasn't going to be the role for me. My current workplace is toxic as hell, but it was really fun for the first few years until new management came in, and so I am willing to stick it out for long enough to find the RIGHT job. I am not willing to apply a bandaid solution only to be miserable and looking again in six months.

A day goes by with no answer to my counter-offer. A few more. Okay, I think, maybe they are looking into whether what I asked for is possible. I don't think they can do it, but it takes time to go through the motions.

A week ticks by. I figure, it's definitely rescinded—I'm comfortable with that—and they're using the rare and exotic Ghost Method to do it. Well, one less uncomfortable conversation for me.

But then! Today! A week and a half after I sent the counter-offer, I receive an email from an HR rep I haven't spoken with before that basically says:

""Dear europeanhousesparrow, we are not able to amend the original offer, which expired on January 30th. We wish you the best of luck in your search.""

I'm sure it doesn't bear mentioning that there was no ""expiry"" date anywhere in the package they sent me, but that's neither here nor there.  
So that's a new one for the books! A twist on the Ghost Rescind: Make Up An Expiry Date And Then Wait Until After It.  
My only regret is that they obviously didn't keep a backup candidate—it would have been nice for some good to have come of this for someone else. But I don't regret my decision, because I know there's something better waiting for me, and hopefully their elevators work.",True,False,False,,0,1549068646,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",efk7usn,False,t3_akmfy6,True,t3_akmfy6,/r/jobs/comments/akmfy6/success_and_disappointment_megathread_for_the/efk7usn/,False,,1553413683,1,True,False,jobs,t5_2qhnd,r/jobs,public,,

Parliamentary elections were held in Venezuela on 6 December 2015 to elect the 164 deputies and three indigenous representatives of the National Assembly. They were the fourth parliamentary elections to take place after the 1999 constitution, which abolished the bicameral system in favour of a unicameral parliament, and the first to take place after the death of President Hugo Chávez. Despite claims from the opposition of a possible last-minute cancellation, the elections took place as scheduled, with the majority of polls showing the Democratic Unity Roundtable (MUD) holding a wide lead over the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) and its wider alliance, the Great Patriotic Pole (GPP).

The political landscape leading up to the elections was heavily influenced by the severe economic crisis faced by the country, as well as a series of protests that took place in 2014, after which former Chacao mayor and leader of Popular Will, Leopoldo López, was detained and sentenced to 14 years in prison.

**2013 Venezuelan presidential election**

Presidential elections were held in Venezuela on 14 April 2013 following the death of President Hugo Chávez on 5 March 2013. Voters gave Nicolás Maduro—who had assumed the role of acting president since Chávez's death—a narrow victory over his opponent Henrique Capriles Radonski, the Governor of Miranda. Capriles had run in the previous election less than a year before, losing to Chávez by an 11-point margin. This time the margin of victory was much smaller (being 1.49%), and thus became the closest Presidential Election of the country since the 1968 election.

**2018 Venezuelan presidential election**

Presidential elections were held in Venezuela on 20 May 2018, with incumbent Nicolás Maduro being re-elected for a second six-year term. Considered a snap election, the original electoral date was scheduled for December 2018 but was subsequently pulled ahead to 22 April before being pushed back to 20 May. Some analysts described the poll as a show election, with the elections having the lowest voter turnout in the country's democratic era.Several Venezuelan NGOs, such as Foro Penal Venezolano, Súmate, Voto Joven, the Venezuelan Electoral Observatory and the Citizen Electoral Network, expressed their concern over the irregularities of the electoral schedule, including the lack of the Constituent Assembly's competencies to summon the elections, impeding participation of opposition political parties, and the lack of time for standard electoral functions.Because of this, European Union, the Organization of American States, the Lima Group and countries such as Australia and the United States rejected the electoral process. However, countries such as China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia, Syria, Turkey and others recognized the election result.The two leading candidates opposing Maduro, Henri Falcón and Javier Bertucci, rejected the results, saying that the election was critically flawed by irregularities.

&gt; WASHINGTON - The United States announced on Friday it will withdraw from the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia in six months unless Moscow ends its alleged violations of the landmark 1987 arms control pact.

&gt; The announcement may aim to pressure Russia to come to terms during the next six months but it also raised fears of a new U.S.-Russian nuclear arms race in Europe as well as one between the United States and China in Asia.

&gt; &amp;quot;If Russia does not return to full and verifiable compliance with the treaty within this six-month period by verifiably destroying its INF-violating missiles, their launchers, and associated equipment, the treaty will terminate,&amp;quot; Pompeo told reporters.

This is how it started in Europe and they are trying to do the same here. Muslims want to normalize themselves as candidates, so it won't seem unusual to see their names on ballots. 

They can be stopped by outing them for what they are and what they represent. Every candidate must be *publicly* and *repeatedly* confronted and asked where they stand on Sharia:

* ""Do you condemn and reject Sharia, which abolishes the first amendment and freedom of speech?""

* ""Do you condemn and reject Sharia, which abolishes equal justice under the law?""

* ""Do you condemn and reject Sharia law, which allows wife-beating?""

* ""Do you condemn and reject Mohammed's advise to use deception when dealing with non-Muslims? Yes or no?""

* ""What is the highest law in the United States? Is it *your* Sharia or *our* Constitution?""

*Hang Sharia and Mohammed around the neck of each and every Muslim candidate and elected official.* Make Sharia a constant political issue.

Yes, the Muslims will lie. It doesn't matter because **the goal is to educate every voter who is watching and listening.**

Sabe aquela história de que brasileiro não desisti nunca. Bem isso. Se era para morrer, morreria tentando ser eu mesma. Também tinha certeza absoluta que nunca passaria de um homem de saia. Que me tornaria um pária social. Que perderia amigos e família. Não poderia estar mais errada. A cada dia que passa me apaixono mais pela pessoa que vejo pelo espelho. Não só não perdi amigos e família como tenho recebido um apoio e aceitação das pessoas ao meu redor que jamais poderia ser concebido.

Title: **Online Relationship - Can we meet before her divorce is completed?**

Original Post: 

&gt; I've been talking with a woman online. I'm from Europe, she's from USA. She has been separated for years, but not legally divorced. She has stuff in both their names and has been dealing with that.  For me to move there and be with her, we need to marry  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;  So the question is: is there any problem at all if we met before her divorce is finalized? Because we'll need later to show evidence that we met and it would be while she's still technically married. If yes, what would be the issues?

What we're speaking about is how much smaller the UK's GDP is compared to what it would be if the Brexit vote had gone the other way. So the point isn't that growth had stopped, but that it has slowed down. Since the referendum the UK's economy grew by about 3.7%. But the estimate is that it would have grown about 6% otherwise.

Anyone who holds onto that belief is a certified moron. Especially in America, 'white' people is an oxymoron because most white people there are actually mutts of some kind. If you believe in white race you're just as stupid as those fuck-nuggets that keep dishing out this 'anti-white male' propaganda.

I mean if you want to play this retarded ethno-race game, the only people that truly qualify as 'white' would be the nordic European folk and people that can trace their lineage back to the caucasus mountains, and have a spotless family tree that supports this. This is more or less nonexistant in America. Almost every white Person over there can probably find some sort of mediterranean roots in their DNA, or other non-White lineage in it.

Just because your skin is 'white' doesn't mean there's such a thing as 'white race'. Nah, chances are you're a genetic mutt already. Not because of some grand genocide plan, but because your ancestors couldn't keep their dick out of that hot piece of spanish or italian ass. 

And before you start moaning; The same principle applies to black people. or whatever other race people believe in. Black people as they exist nowadays across the West aren't 'pure blacks' either. Because there's no such thing as a 'black race'. There's Africans, There's Caribbeans, There's the Island people, There's Jamaicans, so on and so forth. All of these folk have different genetic material, which destroys the idea of 'white/black' race entirely.

Besides, you would actually have to specifically define white race. Just having 'bright' colored skin isn't enough. Italians in that sense aren't 'white', they're Mediterranean. It's an entirely different genotype. Russian/Slavic Folk could be considered white, but at the same time even they have massive differences between Balkan people and Slavic people. Likewise, Balkan and Slavic people have massive genetic differences towards the Nordish folk.

So really, if you want to believe into this white-race conspiracy nonsense and pretend you're some victim of a large conspiracy against your 'own race', Do yourself a favor and get a genetic screening done. Chances are you're a Mutt (especially if born in America) That will have plenty of genomes in there that aren't even remotely Nordic or Aryan.

Our closest ally started taxing canadian steel and aluminum, while threatning to obliterate auto manufacturing. Their lobbies refused to expand pipelines, forcing canadian crude to become worthless. 

Meanwhile, trade negotions with China are going nowhere, because trudeau refused to compromise on a fair deal, in exchange for access to an overhyped chinese market. If they agreed to a deal, chances are, it wouldnt have been fair.

Even worse, Canada is getting flak for follow due process in the arrest of the Huawei CFO. There has been threats of economic consequences. 

Saudi literately issued a royal decree, boycotting Canadian companies on complaints of their abysmal human rights record. As such, Canadian companies like SNC Lavalin lost a third of their value. In return, Canada utilized their strong ties with Turkey to put Saudi in the spotlight in the murder of that journalist. (Seriously, there are so many turkish imports to Canada, especially when it comes to firearms).

I didn't said that, I said I don't trust western news sources about the USSR when they had a long history of anti-communism. Even the most left leaning newspaper had spewed anti-communist propaganda.

&gt; They did it because they were sick of famine and to emulate other Asian nations.

No they did it because Khruschev was a lying opportunist and an embarasment to all socialists worldwide.

&gt; We have the actual documents, signed by Stalin, that prove it was NKVD. Who would try to carry out an easily disproved forgery conspiracy? You're delusional.

Who would carry out a massacre with a stash of foreign weapons for no reason just before a war to try to make it look like they were the Germans when in reality the Germans had plenty of dirt on them, where was absolutely no reason to stage this. You'd think they had better things to spend their money on when they were barely prepared for WW2. They barely had an air force by 1941.

However the Holocaust was already in place by 1940, and the SS had plenty of reasons and they did actually carry out random massacres all the time.

Its much more plausible that it was the SS, just look at what they did to the Warsaw Ghetto. It was definitely the Nazis doing it.

Besides if it was somehow the NKVD can you actually give me a solid reason why would they have done it, instead of just 'Stalin was bad' when they haven't done it anywhere else?

They haven't done it in Ukraine despite them having plenty of right-wingers, and even by your own beliefs the so called 'Holodomor' only affected random peasants.

So why would have Stalin do that when he had no precedent of doing that?

He could have just imprisoned them like any other enemy soldiers. It makes no sense whatsoever.

Please think before you post, swallowing the propaganda is really embarrassing.

&gt; Who would try to carry out an easily disproved forgery conspiracy?

Khruschev.

&gt;  that he never killed one person.

Nobody believes that, he was a revolutionary after all.

&gt; Utterly preposterous, and there is literally no other historian who believes what Furr believes.

This is interesting because even more moderate right-wing historians from Europe question the Holodomor heavily, and have doubts about a lot of things surrounding Stalin. No to mention in China and elsewhere.

The UK and Ireland are in the Common Travel Area, so there is no need to stop people at the border. Goods on the other hand currently flow freely because of mutual membership of the single market (which is also a customs union).

With Brexit, the CTA remains intact, so there would be no need to stop people at the NI border.

Should the UK remain in a CU with the EU, it will depend on the scope of that CU whether goods need to be inspected at the border. For example, [Turkey is in a CU with the EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union%E2%80%93Turkey_Customs_Union), but there are still checks on the EU-Turkey border because the scope of the CU is not broad enough and does not, for example, include agricultural goods.",True,False,False,,0,1549091887,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",efkuvos,False,t3_am6ttz,True,t1_efkly6a,/r/ukpolitics/comments/am6ttz/brexit_whitehall_officials_begin_serious_work_on/efkuvos/,False,,1553424441,2,True,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,r/ukpolitics,public,,

Un exemple que j'ai en tête qui illustre plutôt bien ma pensée c'est une loi de 1965 sur les régimes matrimoniaux. C'est une loi préparée par le Doyen Carbonnier.

Si tu ne sais pas qui il est, Carbonnier était l'un des meilleurs juristes français.

Il a fait précédé cette loi d'une étude sociologique poussée pour établir les attentes des français et les effets possibles d'un nouveau régime légal (la communauté réduite aux acquêts est devenue le régime légale par cette loi).

Cette loi est tellement bien rédigée qu'elle pose encore  les fondations des régimes matrimoniaux à ce jour.

A l'inverse, la loi d'introduction du PACS de 1999 a été tellement mal rédigé que de nombreux auteurs de la doctrine souhaitaient qu'elle soit annulée par le Conseil constitutionnel. Elle ne prévoyait même pas la publicité du PACS.

C'est pour moi la différence entre les lois ""politiques"" et les lois ""juridiques"", l'une a dû être introduite le plus rapidement possible sans réelle préparation, l'autre est le fruit d'une très longue préparation conduite par des juristes hors-pair.

Un autre exemple plus récent, la majorité des règlements Européens majeurs (règlements succession, obligations alimentaires, régimes matrimoniaux...) ont tous eu au moins 10 ans de préparation. Leur qualité est très largement supérieure aux textes par exemples des conventions de La Haye qu'ils remplacent.
