Development:
It can be a big thing in early-mid game for extra income or manpower plus getting Institutions outside of Europe. If you haven’t yet, try playing in Africa, Asia or the Middle-East to see how that is.

Vassals:
It is definitely a good thing to have them, I actually prefer Marches because I’m not so good at wars and combat. Also definitely check the wiki to see what their national ideas are to see what they can be best used for (aka as a March to boost your armies or as a Vassal to help with income).

&gt; ROME. Italy on Thursday reported 285 new fatalities from the novel coronavirus, bringing the total to 27,967, with the largest daily drop in active cases since the beginning of the outbreak.

&gt; Italy&amp;#039;s government commissioner for the pandemic said on Wednesday that the country was now prepared for a second wave of infections &amp;quot;Even bigger than the first,&amp;quot; in case the partial reopening of activities led to a new peak.

&gt; Both the Northern League and far-right Brothers of Italy accused the government of having imposed heavy emergency measures, which limited Italians&amp;#039; constitutional rights, without involving parliament.

Because every deal is unique. Here, the UK can say the ECJ doesn't apply in other deals and yet, it doesn't matter. Each side comes with its conditions and expectations.

&gt;In what way does interjecting with our legal system give them a better trade deal?  

When the UK and the EU will have a conflict in trade matters, simply. It's better to have a judicial body supposed to apply your rules rather than the other one, I suppose. No it isn't fair, it's business.

Don't use ""treating like an enemy"", it is playing the victim card. There is no ""enemy"" here.  You don't do trade at all with an enemy, you set a blockade and you starve him. We're far from it.

You probably never noticed before how the EU is ruthless in negotiations because UK was on the good end of the stick until now. Look at how the EU forced the west african countries to align their agriculture to not compete with EUropean own production while still leaving themselves open to EUropean produce. And they are not enemies either.

And no, the UK won't get any favour. No, the UK won't get a preferential treatment in the name of the 'good old days'. The EU has interests like the UK has. But now, they are no longer aligned, coordinated or the same.

&gt;Is it your general position that countries that are involved in trading  blocs should be able to do whatever they want to countries who aren't?

The EU isn't able to do whatever they want. The UK can perfectly refuse to sign any deal. And that's all.

&gt;So I guess you'd have no problem if the UK violated the sovereignty of a  poorer country, 'cos that's just life right?

That had nothing to do with a pandemic and everything to do with a housing market at all time highs and a stock market at all time highs since the 2008 crisis. That crisis was a housing market crisis (created by the financial industry and) ""solved"" by printing a bunch of money and making it easy for people to spend it in the housing a stock market the last 10 years.

While we're on the subject, when has anyone ever offered people money to take their oil because nobody can afford to store it? That hasn't happened in my lifetime.

That is a lot of jobs lost already with consumption so low and Saudi's flooding the market. 

When has unemployment globally gone higher than the great depression in a period of 2 months?  

When have businesses been told to stay closed so that people social distance globally? And consumption on products that aren't food shelter and clothing went down 80%? 

Remind me when THAT happened and then explain why housing isn't correcting in any way and people on wall street are selling a story that a pandemic is ""priced in"" already lol 

We haven't even touched on the trade war that started in 2019 between China and America. Remember they devalued their currency and Trump started barking on twitter how the Fed needed to weaken the US dollar. European banks had negative interest rates last year BEFORE a pandemic. 

We still haven't seen the first bank go bankrupt internationally but all of them are over leveraged and wont want to lend in an environment like this. Then you have central banks questioning each others currency value during this.... 

I mean, what the hell gives an investor confidence in a market like this? How is this even being a ""doomer"" when this IS actually unprecedented?

I think we can and it is desirable. Often the reason deer overpopulates is because their natural predators were killed - because these also attacked our livestock. They are part of a balanced eco-system. In Yellowstone, 1995, wolfes were reintroduced. Deer started to avoid certain areas of the park, their absence meant plants could grow again. Aspen and willow trees began to flourish. With the trees, came berries and bugs. Thanks to that various birds returned to the park. With the trees, the beaver, previously extinct in the park, was also back. Their dams attracted otters, muskrats and various reptiles. The wolves also killed coyotes, so the mice and rabbit population grew. This attracted foxes, weasels, badgers and hawks.

I think it is more desirable, and beneficial overall to have than say, shaved areas of cattle-farms.  
Animal agriculture is also the main driver for species extinction. And as you said, birthrates decline as living standards increase. In Europe for example birth-rates are even below sustainability level. I don't think that people being vegan or not is a main deciding factor in that regard and I do think we have to take into account our current situation. Feeding all humans with grass fed beef isn't sustainable or feasible.

But, I agree, we could say, population size is the main driver, poor sustainability choices do only increase or multiply that issue. (We could argue in an ideal sustainable case: What was better, more vegan humans, or fewer ones but eating meat)  
Lets for our moral matters, though, take a scenario where none of this would be an issue. So little humans that it would be sustainable either way:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;(Trait:) animals are domesticated

If this is the dividing factor for you that makes it ok, to kill and eat animals but not humans, then you would be against killing and eating wild animals (similar to how you think eating humans is wrong). Do you think it would be immoral to kill and eat wild animals?

Let me apply this ""domestication""-factor to a human scenario. (I know I'm stretching the term or definition here a bit, but I think when we discuss exactly that issue between the distinctions of humans and animals than that is reasoned to do). And apply the exact same steps and actions taken in domestication of an animal, to a human.

Say hypothetically, the romans, 2000 years ago, with their boats came across an island with a wild native tribe of humans in Asia or wherever. They took them captive and started to farm and eat them and breed them to alter their genetics so they grow faster (they become much fatter), and also much more docile and accustomed to be farmed. They have changed significantly from their original form, and could not survive outside of that farming situation in a wild scenario.

Would you say, it was justified for us today to kill and eat those humans, based on the fact, that they went through the steps of a domestication process?

Because the main issue, for me with your argument is, that every justification you give, would fall flat, when you apply it in the same way to humans. Let me show what I mean:

How do these justifications ring true to you, in that new situation?

\- we can condemn it, but it already happened.

\- It would be ""odd"" to call them captive, they evolved to be in that situation.

\- They require to be domesticated at this point, because they have evolved to exist in captivity.

\- These humans have much higher success rates in captivity, they would go extinct without us continue farming and eating them (on a larger scale).

\- It's more cruel to destroy them all, than to kill a percentage of them each year. Their collapse would go against the will of the whole tribe.

\- Each killed provides value to sustain the tribe. It is symbiotic and beneficial for them to keep eating them.

My question to you: What do you think would be the appropriate thing to do with these humans, if we found ourselves today in such a situation?

That would be my main question.  
And maybe *how much* worse are you morally allowed to treat these humans, after they went through a process of steps of domestication in the past, than other humans who didn't?

Few more things:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;such a collapse would go against the he will of the whole species.  
an animal has no concept of ""killed early"".

That seems a bit picky to me. I think if it had a concept of global species sustainability or success, then surely also of its own lifespan. I'd argue it does actually have the latter, otherwise it wouldn't run away when it perceives a threat that would end its life earlier.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Duration of life seems irrelevant to me if it is mostly happy.

This alone would not be a justification either I'd say. With the same reasoning I could argue, when I raise kids, and they are happy. It is ok for me to then kill an eat them. I mean total happiness is positive and then potentially infinite if we continue doing so, right?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;what trait do domesticated animals lack that makes it ok to want to make them extinct, but non-domesticated animals have that makes it not ok to make them extinct

I don't think they differ in a specific trait. And exactly therefore also be equal in the regard of freedom and autonomy. I think we should evaluate them and give their freedom a fair shot. Most cattle for example could live in the wild.  
But say other ones: like chickens that grow so fast, their legs break.  
I don't think it is justification enough to continue breeding them into existence en masse for the next thousands or millions of years or how long. They suffer tremendously and are entirely our creation. Veganism will be a gradual process, we will not have to free billions of them from one day to another.  
Maybe the right and fair thing to do would be to assist such a breed to regain its ability to survive in the wild, or protect them, since it was our choice to take away these capabilities.

I figured you believed that. That's why I quoted above

&gt; Mussolini declared in 1934 that ""[t]hree-fourths of Italian economy, industrial and agricultural, is in the hands of the state

An economy that is only 1/4 privately owned is not capitalism. Or in any case, there is only a small capitalist sector, usually the most productive BTW, 

&gt; Again state-control doesn't automatically make it socialist.

It depends which of the thousand definitions of socialism you are using. By my definition that's pretty much what it means. Capitalism is where private companies compete for the business of consumers. If the government runs a factory and enforces a monopoly for that factory, then it is not capitalism. 

Capitalism can include worker owned businesses. If all the workers of a company own the company privately and compete against other private companies, to me that's capitalism.

State capitalism is an oxymoron.  If the business is not privately owned and doesn't compete with other private businesses, then it is socialism. Whether the government exploits it's workers is immaterial. Exploitation exists in any system. 

&gt; ""Fascist governments in both Italy and Germany privatized state-owned enterprises at certain times.

But they nationalized more than they privatized and aimed to increase government control of business even more. The Fascist government controlled 3/4 of the economy. That didn't happen by privatizing everything.

&gt; Fascism has corporatism, which is regarded as a mixture of Communism and Capitalism, but in practice it is much more capitalist. As Fascist governments favored wealthy businessmen and suppressed worker rights.

Not really.

&gt; #Fascist Manifesto of 1919

&gt; In 1919, Alceste De Ambris and Futurist movement leader Filippo Tommaso Marinetti created The Manifesto of the Italian Fasci of Combat (the Fascist Manifesto).[120] The Manifesto was presented on 6 June 1919 in the Fascist newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia. **The Manifesto supported the creation of universal suffrage for both men and women** (the latter being realized only partly in late 1925, with all opposition parties banned or disbanded);[121] proportional representation on a regional basis; government representation through a corporatist system of ""National Councils"" of experts, selected from professionals and tradespeople, elected to represent and hold legislative power over their respective areas, including labour, industry, transportation, public health, communications, etc.; and the abolition of the Italian Senate.[122] **The Manifesto supported the creation of an eight-hour work day for all workers, a minimum wage, worker representation in industrial management, equal confidence in labour unions as in industrial executives and public servants, reorganization of the transportation sector, revision of the draft law on invalidity insurance, reduction of the retirement age from 65 to 55, a strong progressive tax on capital, confiscation of the property of religious institutions and abolishment of bishoprics, and revision of military contracts to allow the government to seize 85% of profits**.

    Buffeted by criticism of his policy on Europe, battered by rebellion in the ranks over his bill to legalize same-sex marriage and wounded by the perception that he is supercilious, contemptuous and out of touch with mainstream Conservatism, Mr. Cameron earlier this week took the highly unusual step of sending a mass e-mail (or, as he called it, “a personal note”) to his party’s grass-roots members.

Even if your complete goal is rehabilitation, you are still ""harming"" them. You are removing their freedom, their ability to make choices and go where they please. So would you argue that you can't force rehabilitation? I'm sorry, but harming someone isn't a binary thing, it's very much a spectrum. And unless you are completely against any enforcement of the law, then you are for ""harming"". Do you believe all enforcement of law should be abolished? Or should we let murders continue murdering because if we tried to stop them we would be imposing on their right to do what they please, and make us just as bad as they are? Now I will agree that excessive harming is immoral. But I consider excessive harming as inflicting pain for the purpose of inflicting pain, with no real benefit. Revenge essentially. But keep in mind that prison can still be a deterrent without prisoners having to fear for their lives and well-being. They can be moderately punished and still be treated with human dignity. I'm not trying to say that what is going on in prisons right now is A-okay.

But shouldn't society have the right to defend itself? Should individuals have the right to defend themselves? Is is wrong to kill someone who is currently trying to kill you? They are still people, after all. I don't think it is, and I don't think it's different at a societal level. Society has the right to do what it has to in order to protect itself.

&gt; The US Dollar (USD) recorded broad losses during yesterday’s trading session as demand for the safe-haven currency was stifled by improving market sentiment.

&gt; This comes as investors grow increasingly optimistic at the prospect of more countries reopening their economies.

&gt; The US Dollar will face more headwinds in today’s session with the publication of the latest US GDP figures, which are expected to show domestic growth contracted by a sizable 4% in the first quarter.

&gt; Also influencing USD exchange rates will be the Federal Reserve’s latest rate decision. No policy changes are expected this month, but will the Fed’s forward guidance hint that the bank could implement additional stimulus measures in the future?

https://www.poundsterlinglive.com/usd/13205-u-s-dollar-attempts-to-stabilise-after-fed-pledges-whatever-it-takes-and-ahead-of-ecb

&gt; The Dollar was attempting to stabilise on Thursday after suffering broad losses overnight in response to the latest Federal Reserve (Fed) policy statement and clinical trials results for Gilead Sciences' remdisivir, although its trajectory into month-end could now be at the discretion of the European Central Bank (ECB)

&gt; Currency markets were choppy Thursday, leading the Dollar Index to alternate between fractional gains and losses following the latest Fed update and ahead of an ECB policy announcement that's key to where both the Euro-to-Dollar rate and Dollar Index end the month. The ICE Dollar Index has risen 0.35% for April and the Euro-to-Dollar rate has fallen -1.33% and was trading 0.05% higher around 1.0882 Thursday. The Pound-Dollar rate was down -0.09% at 1.2458.

&gt; This is after the Federal Reserve made no changes to its multiple programmes that offer monetary support to U.S. companies and households on Wednesday but told markets in an unambiguous manner that it stands ready to provide whatever financing is necessary to backstop the economy and set it on the road to recovery once the pandemic is brought under control.

More than 430 million enterprises in hard-hit sectors such as retail and manufacturing risk ""serious disruption"", the UN agency added.
The findings appear in the ILO Monitor third edition: COVID-19 and the world of work, released Wednesday.
Globally, there are some 3.3 billion workers. Two billion have jobs in the informal economy, the most vulnerable workers in the labour market. The agency said 1.6 billion in the informal economy ""have suffered massive damage to their capacity to earn a living"" as a result of the economic meltdown triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Due to lockdowns or because they work in hard-hit sectors, these workers globally have seen a 60 per cent drop in income during the first month of the crisis, according to ILO estimates.
This translates into a more than 80 per cent decline in Africa and the Americas, 70 per cent in Europe and Central Asia, and 21.6 per cent in Asia and the Pacific, the ILO said.
ILO Director General Guy Ryder said as the pandemic and the jobs crisis evolve, the need to protect the world's most vulnerable workers becomes even more urgent.
""For millions of workers, no income means no food, no security and no future. Millions of businesses around the world are barely breathing. They have no savings or access to credit,"" he said. ""These are the real faces of the world of work. If we don't help them now, they will simply perish.""
The UN agency estimated that compared to the pre-crisis levels, there will be a 10.5 per cent deterioration in working hours during the second quarter (Q2) of the year, equivalent to 305 million full-time jobs. Previous projections had put the figure at 6.7 per cent, or 195 million full-time workers.
The situation has worsened for all major regions, again compared to pre-crisis levels. Q2 estimates suggest a 12.4 per cent loss of working hours in the Americas, and 11.8 per cent for Europe and Central Asia. All other regions are above 9.5 per cent.
The ILO added that the proportion of workers living in countries where workplace closures have been recommended, or required, has decreased from 81 per cent to 68 per cent over the past two weeks.
While this is largely due to changes in China, measures have been stepped up elsewhere. At the same time, 436 million enterprises operating in wholesale and retail, manufacturing, accommodation, and other economic sectors that have been hardest hit, face ""high risks of seriousruption"".
The ILO called for ""urgent, targeted and flexible measures"" to support both workers and business, particularly smaller enterprises and those in the informal economy.
""Measures for economic reactivation should follow a job-rich approach, backed by stronger employment policies and institutions, better-resourced and comprehensive social protection systems. International coordination on stimulus packages and debt relief measures will also be critical to making recovery effective and sustainable. International labour standards, which already enjoy tripartite consensus, can provide a framework,"" it said.
The ILO also stressed that international coordination on stimulus packages and debt relief measures will be critical to making recovery effective and sustainable.

The problem in linguistics and finding one language that all languages came out of is that we can re-construct the languages all the modern languages came out of up to a certain point. The only problem is we hit this wall around 5000ish years back where we can't figure out how proto Indo-European connects with ancient Chinese, Japanese, or any other language family. All attempts at re-constructing a global origin language have been rejected by linguistics as a whole. You are right to point out that if we could truly re-construct a proto-world language that all modern languages naturally descended from, it would disprove the Tower of Babel, but we can't, and this fits with the Tower of Babel story. This inability to re-construct an origin language gets even stranger when you realize that there is one and only one exception to the 5000 year rule. The Afro-Asiatic language family. We can trace back every language family to give or take 5000 years back, but we can re-construct proto Afro-Asiatic to give or take 9000 years (these are estimate numbers, I don't care about the value, just the proportions between them). Why can we re-construct one and only one language family to be significantly older than all the rest? It fits with the Tower of Babel story. We have all people come to the Tower of Babel and they all have one language, and then God miraculously causes different people to speak languages with no natural relation. He then takes one group of people and determines that he isn't going to confuse their language, but he is going to let that group of people speak the original language. All language families can be re-constructed to a language spoken at the tower of Babel, only one language family can be re-constructed further back. This is the correlation I am seeing that is enough to convince me that it is true, including the historical records that speak of it's existence.  There is one more important thing about which language family was spared. Afro-Asiatic is the language family that includes languages like Omotic, Arabic, and Hebrew. Focus on Hebrew. Every other culture has ludicrous stories when they talk about anything relating to an event the Bible talks about,.you almost get the sense that large portions of their earliest myths not only experienced the normal processes of legendarization, but that parts of them also got lost in translation. Only the family Hebrew is a part of was spared, which means that the Hebrew people had the ability to tell the stories of the Flood and before in the language it was originally told in, and if not in the language it was originally told, they were able to change the way they told the story as the language slowly changed alongside it so that nothing important was lost in translation. This is why the Biblical story makes more sense then other flood myths, why it is more logical, why it is clearer, and it is because of the tower of Babel.

So with the flood, you are going to have to deal with my Biblical research, because the geaneology from Heber to Abraham in the Masoretic text is wrong (represented by the KJV). Josephus disagrees and the Septuagint disagrees and I also heard the Samaritan pentatuch disagrees but I haven't read that one. Basically, the Masoretic text removed some 600 years from the geaneologies of Shems sons to make Shem look like Melchizedek to disprove Hebrews, and that places the flood 600 years earlier than you probably thought, so you have nothing left but a whole litany of civilizations born after the Biblical flood and a whole bunch of flood myths. BTW, I am using Josephus, the Septuagint, and the Samaritan Pentatuch to say that the original autographs of Genesis was different from the MT. As I said, I believe what Moses wrote was innerrant, not the King James Version.

But other then that they are looting things as hell, I keep reading stories in the local news all the time about how corrupt they are.

And now he literally overruled the parliament, so he is a de facto dictator, but the EU doesnt care how he violated ""liberal democracy"" as long as their profits are rolling I guess.

&gt; Now I can imagine these parties may have questionable attitudes towards capitalism, but I'm certain they are not supporters of communism in the slightest. 

Okay fair enough, they have obviously lost their class consciousness and have not much knowledge of Marxism, so they have no idea. And besides it's not like socialist countries put a lot of effort into educating people on politics, so that was one of their biggest faults. Now today, if every form of media is capitalist owned, which it is, and you basically have a population that is frustrated, but doesnt know what to do, of course they will support the first populist demagogue that will come their way. What can you do it people are stupid.

&gt; The fact is, no matter what your own opinion on things, that multiple countries overthrew their communist leaders so that not one communist regime survived.

Actually that is not true, only a few countries had large participation, especially Poland. In other places people literally just watched it from their TV how their government was changed, they had no say in it (not that they had a lot of say in the socialist system, a great mistake of not holding on to mass line, but the bastard revisionists were to blame). I would not call that a revolt when you watch on your TV how socialism is switched back to capitalism.

&gt; but it's clear that these current states are no where near the level of widespread dissatisfaction that arose during the communist era.

I would not be so sure about it, but the western media has a massive bias of not covering any type of dissent against it, not just that international news wont make it, but the press here is also owned by big billionaires who will definitely not talk anything about it, since that would literally delegitimize their little project that they have been having here. A lot of people are dissatisfied, in fact if you were to do a ""happiness index"" as some countries do, it would certainly be at a 3 out of 10 for most people, and not necessarily the poverty, but just the blatant disregard for human life and corruption in general.

\&gt;No that is more than ""cultural"". We were only talking about cultural autonomy, not about regionalization or secession.

I was referring to strasserists and third positionists i've encountered, they believe in full self-determination, like native americans getting their own countries and whites going back to europe.

\&gt;You are the liberal here, giving them full secessionist rights is counter-revolutionary, because they are actively trying to sabotage the centrally planned economy and anti-socially isolate themselves instead of participating in the shared economy.

Imagine being so much of a liberal you think anything that isnt multiculturalism is bad.

With that said, i'm not exactly for full secessionist policies like strasserists although I get where they are coming from. It totally depends on the context, like i said before i admire what the EZLN dudes do, they have autonomous regions that work with each other and trade but they are governed by various people's councils who meet at congress sessions, everyone more or less under a left umbrella ideology. So in my ideal national communist society there would be something like communes composed of various people from tribal and rural backgrounds, where workers' councils may or may not be ethnicity/race-based, everyone as one homogeneous unite, acting as free-associating producers but with the same ideology. This way national identity is preserved while being internationalist.

\&gt;TIL that subordinating every nation on earth under a common socialist united nations is = to imperialism. // Imperialism is when capitalists unilaterally colonize nations, not when nations collectively impose a binding law on everyone.

Setting aside i didnt say you wanted to be a direct imperialist like liberals, according to lenin's theory on imperialism, if those socialist nations were dealing with the exportation of kinds of capital, that would be imperialist. Imperialism isnt always about colonization, we are in a post-colonial world kind of. This is why some marxists see PRC as imperialist.

\&gt;We are anti-war, we can't use the tools of capitalists, plus it's the nuclear age. Direct warfare has been proven to not work right after the USSR-Polish war.

Soviet-afghan war was 30 years into the nuclear age and they ""invaded"" to help support the communist government who literally begged for their assistance

\&gt;I have been looking around, and it looks like my desk lamp is ""made in China"", but also my mug from which I am drinking my tea now, my TV, my Laptop, the mattress in my bed, and probably 90% of my house utilities are Chinese origin. So what does this tell you about the materialist composition of modern capitalism is a socialist country is literally keeping modern capitalism on life support and has the power to cut the cord at any moment?

Still doesnt mean that PRC is forcing us to be communist. Besides, PRC's biggest trading partner is US with EU is a close second. If PRC cut off the cord, she would probably die since the US would tell EU to cut the cord too. Oddly enough US and PRC owe each other the same amount of debt, so anyway.

\&gt;Fuck off idiot, it's not as indifferent when you have to live under it. It's the material conditions that fucked things up here, and by stealing our laborers more, it won't make it better. We need our economy back.

As much as I want to cuss at you, itd only de-evolve this convo. So you're a cotton-headed ninny-muggin.

Brain drain from 3rd world countries would also be good in your model, those smart people will get jobs easily and immersed in 1st world liberal culture faster than a non-skilled person, since big cities with good jobs are usually progressive. Likewise destabilizing of 3rd world countries just means mature capitalism could hopefully be exported to them in the form of aid.

After seeing the response to the attempted sale of one of these yesterday, and the fact that the last guy decided not to sell, I thought I would put mine up here. I was planning to sell in the next couple weeks, but the immediate interest has motivated me to move a bit faster. I do love this watch, but I have a Nomos Tangente which has similar aesthetics, and gets loads more wrist time; I have far too many watches ATM, and am trying to whittle the collection down a bit.

For sale is a Hamilton Khaki Navy Pioneer, ref. H771553, still with box and papers. This is the 43mm standard seconds (auto) model.

This watch was purchased new in 2017, and has been well taken care of (spending most of its time in a watch case) since. It is in excellent shape, with only a very few small hairline scratches on the case (you have to look very hard, from very close up, to see them). In all, this has been a well loved, and well maintained, watch for the whole of its life.

I believe the wiring should be OK from my limited understanding. It is not possible to plug straight into the wall as I don't live in the UK :).

I made a simple plug adapter by changing the plug on a UK power strip. I snipped off the UK plug and replaced it with an EU plug. I used Wago connectors to temporarily connect the EU plug to the UK power strip. The power strip, cables and Wagos are rated for many more amps than the blender uses.

I don't think this should void the warranty in any way, and that is why I converted the power strip rather than the blender cord. I believe it would be the same as a UK chef bringing this blender to the continent and plugging it into an EU socket with a well rated plug adapter.

The mains lead appears to be in new condition without kinks or twists.

Yes, the blender is double insulated. That is rather scary that the metal housing could be live! I will be very careful with my further testing.

I will do further testing today on the electrical circuits in my kitchen to confirm that they are good. I am a lousy electrician but I have a nice multimeter and YouTube.

I am praying that I can send it back. The warranty expired a few months ago and I didn't send it back because of Corona lock-down. Hopefully Nisbets UK or Dynamic of France will take pity on me because of the situation. Fingers crossed!

US: **5.9%**

https://covid19info.live/

The US has more deaths per million people because the US was vastly more exposed to the disease due to the US being a gigantic hub of international travel and a destination or return destination.

**1 million** people flew directly from Wuhan to the US after the outbreak was underway there. The west coast of the US was inundated with infected people from China, and the east coast of the US was inundated with infected people from Europe. And this was happening while China and the WHO were still saying that the disease wasn't communicable human-to-human.

Also, to pretend that socialized health care in other countries is contributing to lower death rates than the US is just flat out factually inaccurate, both the premise and the conclusion.

Completely accent free? That is never possible if you don't live in a Spanish speaking country. But this is not necessary. 

Most Europeans speak English. Especially the younger generations or people in smaller countries. All of them have an accent. You hear one word from a Dutchy and you know they're Dutch. Doesn't matter how good they speak English.

In my opinion, the ""you can't get fluent if you're older"" excuse is an excuse made by people who either don't want to put in the work or feel bad that they are not fluent.

It's true that your brain changes with age. Children are very good at ""learning languages"" because they start from a blank canvas. But that doesn't mean that this is the best approach. It takes children a decade to learn one language well. You can be much quicker if you put in the time because you can actually get instructions (from a book or tutor. A tutor isn't necessary). Your accent won't be perfect but you'll probably be able to talk about politics when a child can barely explain how their toys work apart from ""It makes beep beep when you hit that thing"".

I've met and know so many people that learnt a language later in life. My Aunt learnt Spanish by living on Ibiza in her 30s. She's still fluent getting close to 70. My other aunt learnt Spanish for fun (Arabic native speaker, fluent in French, can communicate in German) and she's in her 50s. My grandma grew up in WW2. You didn't learn English in WW2 in Germany. She's still reading books in English to keep her mind busy and active. My mother (62) got her ancient school English out when visiting my aunt and her friends and then later told me ""oh this is kinda cool I just speak and English comes out"". 

You're always able to learn a language. Always. You just need to put in the time. Always (not just as an adult).

The difference, in my opinion, is how the people approach language. There are the people that want to learn one language on their own that buy text book after text book always chasing the next big app and then there are people who already learnt a second language to fluency outside of a school setting (maybe because they visited another country for a long time) and now go for the second one. They know that what got them good in their other second language wasn't studying but exposure.

None of the people I work with were particularly good in English. But because we have such an international team they had to get better. Being forced to talk and read English all day at work made them better and they all acknowledge that. Not a text book.

I recommend the following: get the basics down. Duolingo (don't need to finish it), text book, whatever. Get familiar with the grammar and how the language works. Then get a graded reader. I have this one (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HWZX3JB/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i2). It has okay reviews.

Then just start reading. Once you're done with that, get your favorite book in Spanish. Or any book that seems interesting. Just start reading. Read a sentence / page / chapter / whatever without looking things up and then go back and look up words you don't know. Write them in the book. If the first page if all black because of your notes after you're done, you're doing a very good job.

Then maybe start a show in Spanish (with Spanish subs maybe). Maybe look for YouTubers. 

If you're already in your 30s you probably have a career and / or family. You probably don't move to Spain or Latin America for a while. You are probably happy that you can maintain your social life after work as it is already so finding new friends that speak Spanish might be tough.

The goal is to make your free time as Spanish as possible. But you don't want to spend all your free time stduying. So get to a point where you can enjoy what you would do anyway in your free time and just do it in Spanish. And you don't actually need to be very good at Spanish for this.

Just graduated last semester, live in Lafayette - just airing this as something of concern, again - for those living here currently, as in now - today - over the coming few weeks. 

Over the next few weeks Lafayette will see a rise in cases and deaths - there already 110 confirmed cases here in Lafayette, and two confirmed deaths (the number of suspected deaths is much higher - death from pneumonia and other respiratory illnesses has been unusually high in countries around the world over the past few months (literally all around the world, even in war-torn Yemen and anarchic Somalia there has been widespread death due to unexplained respiratory illness. 

In Tajikistan, a country long plagued by war and civil strife, the first case - or 16 cases - today. Previously, an unexplained massive rise in deaths and especially severe illness had been deemed by the government to be 'the result of a particularly bad case of the pneumonia this season' - literally denying covid19 could be a cause. 

Now only North Korea, Turkmenistan (which may be even more totalitarian and cult-of-personality driven than the DPRK, but has tons of oil, natural gas, uranium and other highly desired natural resources) and the tiny African state of Lesotho have yet to officially announce cases. 

This is global. It affects some demographics more than others. Those in more polluted areas, or who have lived in such areas long-term in the past. Anyone with lung issues, including asthma. Anyone with heart conditions including hypertension (so, basically half the people my age). Auto-immune issues. Cancer. Seizures. And so on... is more likely to suffer tremendous illness or death. Older people, too. Those people are people's parents and grandparents. My parents, just at 60, are both in extreme danger as a result of different underlying conditions and are in full lockdown. It could easily prove fatal. And there are a hell of a lot of people who can say that. If you don't want to play Russian Roulette with your odds on this virus; your family members' odds; your spouse or significant others odds; etc. of survival then that is on you. But recognize how, statistically, at least one of them is going to die, and three are going to end up hospitalized at some point between now and this time next year. The world is not only facing economic collapse, it is facing psychological collapse. The shear amount of grief - do you even understand it? Do you understand the fear of being in your 30s and suddenly realizing both your parents could die - only to have that fear further encouraged by having a sibling and nieces contract it (and with my 1 year old nieces developing 104 degree temperatures). It is a matter of time before virtually everyone can tell a story like that, if they themselves didn't get sick and were lucky enough to either not contract it or prove asymptomatic. 

So Russian Roulette with the lives of everyone you interact with in the coming few weeks (or whatever the timeline is for your particular locale), or behaving rationally and being a responsible citizen like the rest of us and actually stay home. I mean, hell - is that actually asking that much? Stay home.

You aren't being drafted into working in a hospital or field hospital.

You aren't burying the dead. 

Or storing them in freezer trucks, as is happening in NYC. And similar things in LA.

Other generations got drafted. Or were left homeless by the tens of millions. Or fought in any number of conflicts.

You? 

Just, stay home.

Yes - you get to stay home, sit on the internet, watch Netflix, shop on Amazon, go outside and take a stroll (not allowed in many countries right now, both democratic and authoritarian). You can play a damn videogame, eat food, stay up all night. You can 'work from home' for a business never set up to - so you get paid to watch Netflix and play videogames and so on. 

Yes, more needs to be done to deal with the current economic problems that are immediate (including a guaranteed income for a set number of months; rent relief; utility relief; further support for small businesses to start back up later in the form of grants, not loans, and a national approach to rebuilding international and domestic supply chains. 

But you won't have a hand in any of that anyway. 

And in the meantime, you aren't being sent to trenches off in Europe, or in an Atlanta hospital. 

81% of Americans and 99% of global citizens just want you to stay the hell at home.

I always struggled with early feedback, since quite often it points to aspects that I know will be different in the end anyways.

I can see the benefit however, since the earlier you go and change something, the easier it’s going to be.

To understand why the market is rallying, you have to answer why the market rallies when it does. Why doesn't it rally all the time when that'd mean people can make money easy? 

####Why doesn't the market rally all the time? 

One word. RISK. 

Markets are future looking and rally when the risk that was priced in into current prices drop - either due to business(es) booming beyond expectations - showing that previous expectations are no longer valid, and that they (businesses) will make more money than previously imagined. Another reason is governmental actions that reduce risk - like lowering interest rates which reduce risk for companies by making cheaper debt available, and more money being open to be lent. 

Of course I don't need to suggest that these perceptions of reduced risk (via government actions or more commonly via expectations of better business) need not always be accurate. It helps to remember the frenzy around the dot com bubble where stocks companies that weren't making money were bid to the moon - a rally, yes, but a bubble. 

The difference between a bubble/hype and a regular rally is sustainability. If the new knowledge results in a sustainable increase in income for the companies, then the rally is far more likely to be stable. If it's not, then sooner or later the earnings are going to spill out the story, and that's the end of that. If at any point there is irrational exuberance in the market, then there opens up an avenue to make money by going against the markets and waiting for the markets to correct. The market is kind of self correcting in that fashion. The shift is fast - much like a level balance that's heavy and tilted to one side for long and shifts rapidly to the other as the weight on the opposite end increases. And near the balance point where the forces are nearly equal, you see that the slightest shifts in weight cause great movements - the volatility is high. 

####Why is there risk in the markets? 

One reason there is risk in the markets is because the companies need money to service their expenses and payroll and they can do so via income from selling goods and services or by raising debt.

Well, with fed announcing their intent to support the markets any way possible, an interesting phenomenon occurs.  Since fed had promised to take action including buying junk bonds - a lot of companies who a few months ago had to worry about raising debt, now have the fed as a willing buyer their debt/bond issues. It means that it has become less risky to invest in these companies now, than it was in January because they are more assured of safety now, than before. Compared to sometime ago, say early January, the markets are now actually less risky. And naturally money is flowing into these stocks. 

A second effect is via the Congress's pushing of bills to put money directly in the hands of the people - via direct cheques as well as payroll support for small businesses via loans that are explicitly forgivable. This means that there is money in the accounts of common people - even though they don't have a job or are not actively working on a job - and the belief is that they are going to spend this money, and so the outlook for a lot of companies is not too bad because consumers are continuing to spend - and their spending is someone's income. In particular look at Netflix, Amazon etc. 

A third effect is due to the status of the dollar as a reserve currency, as a safe haven in turbulent times. This has caused a flow of money from various locations into the dollar, and a strengthening dollar let's the fed print more dollars, because there is strong demand for it.

A fourth effect is due to the historic low yields on bonds. Europe has plenty of negative yielding papers and even the US has low interest rates. All the money that wants to find yield has few places to go with such low yields everywhere - so a good fraction of that ends up in the stock market. This, tbh was happening even before the crash. The valuation of the equity markets depends on the availability other lower risk avenues of returns. In the absence of which the equity valuations soar. 

#### Long term effects

If you buy a Mavic pro or pro 2 it should work but the input lag is very high and you can’t fly FPV properly, only in an open area/sky.

The tiny whoop is a good compromise, later you can build one by yourself or buy a rtf FPV model. You can repair them if something messed up by crashing it.

If you fly real FPV (race or freestyle) get the right gear and don’t buy a camera drone.

The two-storey building was completed in 1961 during the city's boom of ""desert modernism"" – a mid-20th century style that adapted European modernist design principles to suit the desert valley's dry and arid climate.

The sculptural white colonnade along the building's front is both decorative and bolsters the structure in the event earthquakes. At the base, the columns join to form scooped bottoms and resemble the distinctive facade of Alvorada Palace that Brazilian that modernist Oscar Niemeyer completed in 1958. Although Williams reportedly denies basing his design on the Niemeyer residence, the slim pool with fountains at the front of the bank is also similar to the mass of water surrounding the presidential residence in Brasilia.

Thank you for your kind words too!

I'm born and raised in Greece and honestly you should visit Greece once global lockdown is done but you shouldn't only visit tourist attractions there is more to Greece than that. And you should follow your gut feeling indeed!

I'm sorry that your mother is horrible too! My mum has been physically and mostly emotionally abusive towards me all my life, only in recent years has she tried to be a kinder which scares me even more because she acts as if the previous 18 years of my life hasn't happened and she actually tries to gaslight me into thinking that my point of view of events is wrong or over dramatic...which angers me. Unfortunately, she has said far worse things to me other than blaming me for grandpa's death, especially a sentence I will never forget or forgive is her telling me I'm an emotionless bitch that deserves what I got and I will get. This sentence was referred to me being a victim of bullying at school and in general in life. She has told me that I am ugly and no man would love me because of it. And so on... 

I keep my distance from my mum especially emotional distance from all my family, I don't show my true emotions and during this quarantine I realized that I had put up a facade with them for so long that they thought I was a complete different person than who I am truly and they were shocked when I would let a little bit of my true self show on purpose instead of by accident.

I have been feeling strong connection to Ireland my whole life, Celtic folk music helps me calm down from anxiety attacks. I also love 1920s Jazz and Swing, oh I can be listening to that music all day! Then I love instrumental music too! It's so weird in the eyes of my family since I was raised in a Rock/Heavy Metal and Greek folk music listeners' household. 

I remember watching Irish folk dancers on TV and feeling so at home! I remember that I got so excited that according to dad as a toddler I used to go up to the TV screen and kiss it or just touching it and saying ""I miss you"".

I don't know if that has ever happened to you but  Greece has various dialects other than modern Greek and Ancient Greek and it depends on the region you are in. I was mostly raised surrounded by Pontic and Russian-Pontic dialects and as a child I used to mix dialects with modern Greek without noticing which got me bullied at school when I was living in Lesvos where they have their own dialects too and most times I couldn't gety point across so I had to unlearn the dialect although I can still recall words and phrases I won't be able to keep up a conversation solely on dialect though. 

My grandpa was from Eastern Thracy and immigranted to Greece in 1922 when the Turkish and Greek population exchange happened. Eastern Thracy is now part of European Turkey and Bulgaria and they have various dialects which up to the age of 15 years old I was completely oblivious to, mum never spoke dialect and my grandma she didn't want to hear it because she missed her husband, my aunt never bothered to learn and I never met any of grandpa's family who knew Eastern Thracian dialect and was cognitive enough to teach me, I met his two sisters before they died and they didn't speak dialect or when they did was because they were lost in their own head and it was mumbled and jumbled up that it made no sense. So, I'm 18 years old helpingy dad load our broken oven to the elevator to throw it away when I hit the sides of the elevator and I leave a mark on it. I subconsciously cursed not in modern Greek but in Eastern Thracian - Old Bulgarian dialect which caused my dad to look at me shocked and mum to yell at me asking me where I heard it and I didn't know at all. It just came to me and to this day I don't know how. Mum told me that she had heard grandpa say it twice in his life and she didn't know what it meant either. The word I had said was ""Sitma"" yet I can't find anywhere what it means. I asked my Greek Literature high school teacher that has also family from Eastern Thracy if she knew what it meant and according to her ""Sitma"" is a paraphrase for ""Damn it"" and ""Gamoto"" I never listened to that word before!

As for seeing my situation as a gift, well I'm working on it. I still try to get used to it. I spent so much time confused about it and searching for answers that now I'm absorbing information and processing.

*Nol Voorn, now 99 years old, suddenly took the boat to Argentina, a well-known refuge for Nazis, two years after the Second World War. Why ?, her grandson Maarten van Gestel wonders.*  
   
Nol Voorn (26) looks around and sees only water. It is 1947, two years earlier she celebrated in a marquee in Haarlem that the Netherlands had been liberated and danced the foxtrot with friends and her husband. Now she is on the deck of a freighter. Today, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow: every day only water.   


The crossing from Amsterdam to Buenos Aires takes four weeks.  She doesn't know anyone on the ship. Her husband Cor (30) made the trip a few months earlier, he has now found work as a beer mug maker in Buenos Aires. In the Netherlands, hard work is being done on reconstruction. Food is still on the receipt, Nol's peers getting used to the new post-war world. She herself is on her way to Argentina and has no plans to return soon.    


When I tell parties at 2020 that my grandmother Nol (now 99) emigrated to Argentina after the war, I always see the same look in the eyes of my interlocutors. ""Wow, why did she go to Argentina?"" They ask. ""Was she an NSB member?"" I hear them think about it.    


Thousands of Nazis are known to have fled to South America after the capitulation, where they were received with open arms by questionable regimes and thus evaded criminal trial and sentence in mainland Europe.    


That is the history that lives on in our pop culture: in the film Long Shot, which partly takes place in Buenos Aires, the (Jewish) actor Seth Rogen joked last year: ""It is cool to be in Argentina. I think the guys who killed my grandparents are still hiding somewhere here. "" The comedy is otherwise not credible: the plot revolves around a journalist who becomes the speechwriter of his former babysitter, now the upcoming President of the United States, and oh yes, they also fall in love. But the idea that post-war emigrants in Brazil or Argentina or Paraguay were runaway Nazis does indeed contain some truth.  


**Dark atmosphere**

My grandmother was not an NSB member. She left the Netherlands because she was ""afraid of a new war"", I say at those parties, as she always told me. Because she was done with the gray atmosphere here, the shattered cities and the winter of hunger behind her. With her 500 thousand other Dutch people, went to South America, to Canada, to Australia: it was the biggest wave of emigration our country has ever known.

But still, I usually think after those parties, I never really understood why my grandmother turned her life back so rigorously after the liberation in Haarlem. Certainly not after interviewing forty 80-, 90- and 100-year-olds for this My Liberation series for de Volkskrant.

Most of them said they were celebrating. They were relieved from Limburg to Groningen, finally feeling free and looking forward to a brighter future. My grandmother had a great life in the Netherlands: a mother, a husband, nice neighbors, friends, the beach where she went every weekend before the war, a rowing association with which she rowed on the Amstel in 1938.  
   
My grandmother was not eager to travel: as a girl she did not dream of distant countries, even though her father was a captain in the Dutch East Indies. Even after she returned to the Netherlands with my 2-year-old mother from Buenos Aires in the 1960s, she rarely went on vacation.

Couple that with an increase in cost of living. Those ridiculous health insurance costs etc and you would have to seriously value travel to go somewhere outside North or Central America. 

My issue isn't Americans not traveling. I get it...plus I acknowledge many still do. It's that many who have never left the US in any meaningful way will speak with authority about how awful other countries are. 

I'm by no means rich, but I've been lucky enough to travel to around 60 different countries. I've spent a total of probably around 1 year in the US. I came to the same conclusion many other Europeans come to. It's an incredible country...to visit. I wouldn't want to live there.

Travel is expensive...but that's not the reason people don't travel. To get a job that gives you the compensation and time to travel, it's likely you will have needed to spend years at college gathering incredibly debt. The cost of education in the US is silly. All roads lead to a low end entry level job to start paying off that debt before it balloons with interest. 

At this point, people are paying for their own housing, healthcare, car etc. Even when they get that second better paying job...the money gets swallowed up. To spend thousands on a 2 week vacation abroad seems a silly financial decision, so most don't. 

Europeans absolutely have geography on their side in this regard, but they also mostly have much lower University fees, universal healthcare and more vacation time. Many can survive quite well without owning a car because of better transportation systems. 

Also, European society does not see foreign travel as some frivolous expense like I've noticed they do in the US. It's absolutely valued. When I spent all my savings and left my job to go to Australia when I was 22, my parents were so happy I didn't spend it on something stupid. It basically kick started my adult life and now I live in a different country far from home and I've seen things I never thought I would. I came from a poor background.

We live in a smallish city somewhat separated from the largest ones - it's a good size for a balance of essential services vs space/quiet, and if how our city and its population has dealt with the virus is anything to go by, it's an indication that we're in a good place.  We keep enough essentials around to get by for a couple of weeks, and beyond that....well, if two weeks isn't enough, I don't think there's a single thing we could buy, or own, that would likely protect us from whatever the fuck is going on.   That may be näive, or it may be just as you say, a mindset.  But in this case ours is cultivated by how the society around us feels/looks and reacts when times are tougher.  Trust in each other - and in society around us - is a big part of that, I'm sure. (Perhaps it is the biggest when it comes to how people from different countries think about adversity; we see for sure differences in how people react to COVID for example, where conspiracies or cries of injustice flourish in some places, but not elsewhere.)  People can and do change in times of crisis, I'm aware of that as well.  But in any case, we believe the safest place we can be right now is right where we are, in a smallish, generally stoic and practical community of families, old folks and students who know each other already.

That's not to say we don't pay attention to what's happening out there - we do, and back in January/February when we started to get word about the virus, and found out the Chinese were actually buying masks from OUR online shops, that prompted us to be sure we were ready with extra supplies, and a box of five reusable/washable FFP3 masks ""in case"" we had to go out.

&gt; Al Jazeera&amp;#039;s Investigative Unit has obtained exclusive video revealing a huge backlog of goods at China&amp;#039;s biggest export hub that is slowing the supply of medical equipment urgently needed to protect hundreds of thousands of health workers as they fight the global coronavirus pandemic.

&gt; China produces nearly half the world&amp;#039;s supply of protective medical equipment with America and Europe two of its biggest customers.

&gt; The huge backlog of exports at China&amp;#039;s busiest airport is the result of a &amp;quot;Perfect storm&amp;quot; of events that have choked the freight system; tougher Chinese export controls in response to international pressure to weed out sub-standard equipment, huge demand for PPE and a severe shortage of cargo planes.

The United States was originally supposed to function as a bunch of small independent states that shared some resources and services. Think about it like Europe today. You have a bunch of countries that have all tied their economy and laws together, but they’re still their own countries. 

This is what the original vision for the US was. It’s not quite that way today. But you have some leftover legal structure from that time. 

If you take a single state and think of it like a whole country, then the function of a county emerges as a province.  In fact, most states’ governmental structures mirror those of the federal government. Most. There are exceptions. For instance, Louisiana doesn’t have counties. They use “parishes” instead, though they fill the same legal function. 

Just like there’s a President for the country, there’s a President for the state, though they’re called a governor. But the job is essentially the same. Each state has its on version of congress with a state senate and a state house. There are state police, and state agencies. 

Let’s take Tennessee for example. It’s the easy one because that’s where I live. I live in Blount county, in Maryville, which is a suburb of Knoxville. 

If Tennessee was its own country, I would live in Blount province, in the town of Maryville. However, since Maryville and Knoxville are so geographically close together, they are sometimes conflated even though they’re completely distinct.

If I’m talking to somebody local, and they ask where I’m from, I tell them Maryville.  If I’m talking to somebody from, say, California, I tell them Knoxville. Even though Maryville and Knoxville are legally and geographically distinct, they’re close enough and Knoxville is sufficiently larger that people are more likely to know where that is than my little town. 

It can also go smaller than that. Some very large cities are divided even further into legal entities called boroughs or possibly a different word depending on the city. 

New York City, for example, has five boroughs - Harlem, Queens, Brooklyn, Bronx, and Manhattan. 

Each legal division has the authority to write laws for the divisions contained within. 

So the federal government (the United Ststes) can pass laws that affect states, the state government (Tennessee) can pass laws that affect counties, the county government (Blount) can pass laws that affect cities (Maryville) and city government passes laws that affect subdivisons or boroughs of that city (Sandy Springs).

&gt; RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO - Imported by the Brazilian elite vacationing in Europe, the new coronavirus is now ravaging the country&amp;#039;s poor, ripping through tightly-packed neighborhoods where the disease is harder to control.

&gt; Residents in Brasilandia, a poor district at the north end of Sao Paulo with the highest coronavirus death toll in the city, told Reuters that bars were still crowded and open-air dance parties attracted thousands of revelers on the weekends.

&gt; William de Oliveira, a community leader in Rio&amp;#039;s poor hillside neighborhood of Rocinha, can rattle off the names of several friends killed by the virus.

If you don’t require really high-mem or more than 4 cores, these are awesome. You can put 3 of their NUCs in a 1U if you want, or just do one or two depending on needs/budget. The i3 and i5 also offer a custom PSU that does 802.3at PoE, but you may not need that. Without PoE you can go with the i7, apparently i7 sucks too much power to run stable over PoE

If having a proper rackmount is more attractive than using a NUC on a shelf and you don’t have really serious workloads requiring tons of RAM and/or cores, this is the way to go. A friend got one with 3, he PoEs them and loves them- this was about 6 months ago

You pay a bit of a premium since they’re custom built, down to the mounting kit and the actual NUC chassis itself. If you have 802.3af/at at your switch and want to PoE, the PSU is also custom as well obviously. One port does PoE+1Gig, the other is just 1Gig

I saw his three x i5 1U installed- it looks really nice, he says it’s completely stable on PoE and the active cooling on them was quieter than his switch (a 24 or 48 port EdgeSwitch 250w or 500w, not sure which)

They may even have an i9 model, but I don’t see it on the site. They do have an i7 + 8GB + 250GB SSD in the matrix on the site, which seems top of the line, but he thinks they’ll build to spec if you ask. He said they prototyped/tested an i7 on PoE for him but couldn’t get it stable, so they may work with you on special requirements. I assume the RAM could go higher, I know NUCs generally support larger DIMMs

There may be tariff/duty costs if you live outside the EU, where they ship from. He’s within EU so it didn’t cost anything extra to ship

Fiscal paradises exist but they are more and more regulated. Now I do not know how things are in the USA; but I know the EU directives about it, and the more you track money, the more you can tax transfers to and from tax shelters.

Also fiscal paradises awesome concept for the super rich, except if they actually move their money there , and there is a lot of control of international transfers, they are stuck trusting that fiscal paradise to be preventing people from embezzling it or losing it. A fiscal paradise might offer ""hey we take car eof your money, and we charge 100 dollars a year for that and no tax"" which is fiscally advantageous for sure, but what recourse do you have if you do it and bank goes bankrupt (Iceland...) or there is embezzlement or something? It is a balance between risk and no taxation, the places with robust economies who can bail out banks and investment, independent justice systems, non corrupt police to  dissuade embezzlment usually can sell themselves a lot better than by promising no taxes.

&gt;And places badly affected by it will set place tax exempts and securities for these riches, so they feel safe dropping their millions/billions there, while the country benefits from it.

in the current climate, do you think a billionaire really is going to feel secure dropping their billions (in which currency) in an unstable country?

A 25 year old, Palestinian from Israel, goes to America and now Democracy doesn't work? Why did he come to the US then and take a slot at Harvard?

He went to Harvard but doesn't understand the [wisdom of the crowd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd)?

&gt;The **wisdom of the crowd** is the collective opinion of a group of individuals rather than that of a single expert. This process, while not new to the [Information Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age), has been pushed into the mainstream spotlight by social information sites such as [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia), [Yahoo! Answers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Answers), [Quora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quora), [Stack Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Exchange) and other web resources that rely on collective human knowledge. An explanation for this phenomenon is that there is idiosyncratic noise associated with each individual judgment, and taking the average over a large number of responses will go some way toward canceling the effect of this noise.

By design democracy expects not everyone to be a good actor, it is able to deal with that and the only system that can. Democracy requires an informed electorate, but not always or everyone.

Just like a comment thread on reddit, eventually experts emerge. Democracy matches how people transfer information from one generation to the next. The larger the crowd, the more correct the information can be. Democracy allows the people with information to get it out, and spread it. The truth and good information survive longer than the fake news even if the fake news gets a head start.  Without Democracy people that bring those truths and information are sidelined or give up in authoritarian systems.

Yes propaganda is a problem, and fraud, but they will always exist and democracy is the only one that can deal with that, otherwise you have top down authoritarianism eventually. The only system with good noise cancelling for bad ideas and promotion of good ideas, *eventually*, is democracy.

Democracy shows the good and bad and everything in between, it has a pressure release valve.  Authoritarianism, which he says China is doing the best, hides and shrouds the bad and is usually much worse than the presented propaganda (see North Korea). Authoritarianism has no pressure release valve and eventually explodes when the authoritarians have to keep a shell game going to hold on to their ideology.  Democracy can discard bad quicker, though sometimes it moves frustratingly slow, it still moves forward.  Authoritarianism is locked until it explodes.

Wisdom of the crowd also says that

&gt;""A large group's aggregated answers to questions involving quantity estimation, general world knowledge, and spatial reasoning has generally been found to be as good as, but often superior to, the answer given by any of the individuals within the group.""

Authoritarianism, or non western liberalized democracies, eventually leads to dictatorship see in China (Xi president [for life now as of 03/11/2018](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-43361276)) and Russia (Putin president [for life as of 03/11/2020](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51815667)).

I strongly, strongly recommend you do NOT go with this breeder.  Responsible breeders do not allow buyers to pick their own puppies and CERTAINLY not at 3 days old.  Puppies get matched with homes based on personality and needs and that can only be done at 6-8 weeks old.  Allowing you to pick the puppy based on nothing but color and gender shows that the breeder does not care whether or not you're a good match.  They only care about making the sale, and they are willing to do anything to close the deal (oh, you want the tail? Sure, whatever, as long as you pay me!)

A lot of backyard breeders and puppy mills have discovered that there is a market for Aussies with tails, and so they are capitalizing on it.  Responsible breeders make the decision across the board - either all of the pups are docked or none of them are.

I say all this as someone who has a tailed Aussie from a good breeder.  I spent a long, long time doing research.  We drove 7 hours to get our pup, and many of our littermates drove in from further or flew in.  I will tell you now that there are only about 5 good breeders in the US that do not dock.  The majority of responsible breeders of tailed Aussies in the US are breeding them for sport (agility), and so these dogs are a high octane and very intense.  Not recommended for the average owner.

If not docking is a huge thing for you, then I highly suggest importing an Aussie from Canada or Europe where docking is banned.  Otherwise, I'd suggest looking at similar, adjacent breeds such as the English Shepherd.

+ Capitalism has brought more people out of poverty than Socialism. LISA, Europe, India(emerging) and China ( through

Capitalist investment).

The things you think of as Socialist are not. Free healthcare, workers rights, pensions, unions and environmentalism.

None of those things are Socialist. They were all invented by Capitalists.

And Socialism has been responsible for at least 70 million deaths and counting and an economic system that keeps

people working class. The queues you see now for food and goods were the everyday norm in Soviet Union.

Also the current Chinese Socialist government is responsible for death camps, organ harvesting and covering up

Coronavirus which has killed 200,000 and counting as well as propping up the North Korean regime responsible for

killing millions.

Capitalism has brought a few individuals mass wealth and exploited billions of others. Socialism didn't create slave

labor or sweat shops, pure capitalism.

Workers rights, unions, and socialized healthcare are indeed the fruits of socialism and supporters of the working

man. Corporations and billionaires didn't start unions, the working class did, the ideas for which came from socialists

of the 19th and 20th century. If you think capitalism created socilized medicine, then why isn't the biggest capitalist

nation around doing it? Because capitalists never give anyone anything unless there is a profit to be made, you pulled

that out of your ass. Pensions obly need to exist in a system controlled by fancy pieces of paper and greed.

Environmentalism while not exclusively a socialist idea, is an inherently anti capitalist idea. Last i checked, not a single

corporation or billionaire has made any attempt to rememdy the situation they themselves created.

Socialism is not responsible for any deaths because socialism has never been achieved and the only solid attempt at it

was Lenninist Russia, which i might add was pro LGBT, pro gender equality, and anti racism by about 1921;

unfortunately, Lennin died and Stalin ruined all the progress that had been made. You say lines for food were the

norm in Soviet Russia, I take that as Russia actually socialized food and made sure people had food. Here in America

we just let the poor starve.

Lastly, the current Chinese Government isn't socialist, their ""official"" designation is communist. If we are going to be

pedantic about titles and labels, then by your assertion, North Korea is a democratic republic, its right there in the

name. Dont be disingenuous, you know full well China operates as a State Capitalist Oligarchy which is not

communism. I suggest you read a book of socialist and communist theory, that way you don't speak from ignorance

next time.

I can also understand why people might disagree with this. From the comments in this thread it seems to me that there are three main arguments that people are making against diversity, which I've listed below. All of them are understandable, but I think they can all be refuted.

1. 'Middle Earth is supposed to be like medieval Europe - to have an ethnic diversity that is unrepresentative of that historical era damages the sense of realism that makes Middle Earth so great.' -- My first problem with this argument is that it is factually inaccurate. While their numbers were lower than they are today, I don't think any historian worth their salt would dispute the fact that people of colour were not an unusual sight in medieval Europe, even in the Northern cultures that inspired Tolkien. The second problem  I have with this argument is to do with the suggestion of realism. I agree that part of what makes Middle Earth the greatest fantasy universe ever devised is its sense of reality and believability. But it's also a fantasy universe! There are elements of it that are nothing like what medieval Europe was really like. The existence of dragons, for example, or dwarves. If these obviously imaginary factors are acceptable deviations from the historical reality of medieval Europe, then why isn't a greater number of people of colour acceptable?
2. 'It goes against the lore.' -- This is probably the most convincing argument, but I think it's also fundamentally flawed. My response to it is that any adaptation of a text into a film is going to make adjustments to it to make it more appropriate for that medium. I don't think it's controversial to suggest that several of PJ's deviations from the original text in the LOTR trilogy made for better movies. Cutting Tom Bombadil out, choosing to tell the story concurrently rather than in the two points of view used in the novels, and moving the Shelob sequence into ROTK rather than TT, all made for a better experience of Tolkien's story and world in cinematic form. Given that any adaptation will involve some changes to the original text, isn't the inclusion of some people of colour a pretty tiny sacrifice to make? Unless you would like to see a literally word-for-word adaptation of Tolkien's material, which might in fact make for quite bad cinema, then I don't see why this kind of modification isn't one of the first amendments you might want to make.
3. 'Elves can't be black because they are somehow ""light"", ""fair"", ""clean"" etc.' -- OK, but unless there is something inherently light, fair and clean about white actors then there shouldn't be a problem with people of colour playing those roles. I don't like to throw around the r-word very often, but this argument is, I think, essentially racist.",True,False,False,,,0,1588345951,,False,0,{},fp64k6c,False,t3_g47nyx,False,True,t3_g47nyx,/r/LOTR_on_Prime/comments/g47nyx/more_diversity_in_lotr_show/fp64k6c/,False,,1594764459,1,True,False,LOTR_on_Prime,t5_wnoj8,r/LOTR_on_Prime,public,,0,[],

I watch duff football every Saturday afternoon so I see no need to bother with more.

I really don't have an SPFL team, my brother lives in Birmingham and has a Villa season ticket, so I've become a keen fan of anyone they're playing against so that I can wind him up. I find that's about as much as I can be bothered keeping up with.

The Soviets were probably going to be the aggressors should a conventional ground war in Europe ever broke out and they designed the tanks that to be committed to the offense. This is also the reason why their tanks are so much lighter than ours. The t80,72 and 90s are all around 50 tons. The Abrams is nearly pushing 70. They were aimed to cross West Germany's bridges without a problem.

The Chieftans engine was simply underpowered and unreliable. It really was as simple as that. Underpowered would've have been fine, but unreliable is simply a no go for ANY military vehicle. I'm going to paste an answer I found on Quora about the Cheiftans engine from a former tanker that actually manned one during the height of the Cold War:

"" I served on Chieftain Mk2 and Mk5 1971 - 1974

The gun was excellent I managed to hit a target (Centurion) with Sabot AP round at 3,000m while on the BATUS ranges in Alberta Canada.

The armor difficult to give an opinion as it was never tested during my time but we were prety confident that it was one of the best available at the time.

The engine was the biggest pile of crap invented by mankind. Apart from taking hours to replace (A Leopard Mk1) could do this in under half an hour. It was very unreliable. I will attempt to explain. The design for the engine was first developed for the Zeppelins in WWI on paper it gave a tremendous power to weight ratio. Now bear with me this is a bit technical. The engine was a 6 cylinder 12 piston vertically opposed two stroke diesel. The engine had no cylinder head (saving weight) instead it had two crankshafts permanently joined by a series of gears. One at the top and one at the bottom. Each crankshaft was connected to six pistons that came together at the centre of the cylinder to squeeze the air fuel mixture. Like all two strokes it has intake and exhaust ports but relied on the supercharger to blow out the exhaust gases and force in the air. Still with me? Difficult to explain without diagrams.

To add insult to injury the engine was designed by Rolls Royce but the MOD gave the contract to build them to British Leyland. During the seventies British Leyland were probably the worst possible choice as their engineering left a lot to be desired. That is putting it mildly.

A common fault would be that the (wet) liners (cylinders) of the engine would overheat and crack at the exhaust/inlet ports. Coolant would enter the cylinders resulting in huge clouds of steam exiting the exhaust. Much to the delight of the breakdown crews.""

Yeah, if they ONLY looked good vs Afreeca, you would have a point. But they played well against more than just Afreeca. 

Anyway, if you're going to say that Afreeca collapsed, then what do you call EDG in 2016? What do you call G2 in 2016? Surely, those teams must have been utterly shattered. You can't possibly believe that they played up to snuff?

Actually, you can't possibly believe it, because it is empirically not true that EDG played like the LPL champions that had dominated their region goin 18-0 in matches and 38-7 in games. Why? Because Pawn was playing for them in groups. Scout was the person that played most their matches in LPL. Scout played 90% of the game, a full 40/45 games. Pawn played against some bottom teams, so it really didn't matter too much. 

And was Pawn the same caliber of player as Scout? Not at the time. Objectively, he was not. Pawn was amongst the bottom of mid laners while only playing against the bottom of mid laners. He only ever played against Tockers, Chawy, Westdoor, and Ryu. He never played against Faker, Kuro, Crown, Bjergsen, Perkz, Xiaohu, Scout (impossible), or Jensen. Yet, he still managed to perform like shit: -12.8 CS, -435 Gold, and -597 XP and 475 DPM (13/19 mid laners in DPM). Meanwhile, when Scout played against the likes of Tockers, he destroyed him and carried the game, something Pawn was unable to do and so EDG lost to INTZ. 

Yet, you will still maintain that C9 is the worst major region team to make it to the top 8, even though H2K's road was the easiest we have ever seen.",True,False,False,,,0,1588348067,,False,0,{},fp68oay,False,t3_gb3ppy,False,True,t1_fp5hcgh,/r/leagueoflegends/comments/gb3ppy/the_crack_down_s01e15_overcoming_tilt_how_jankos/fp68oay/,False,,1594766523,0,True,False,leagueoflegends,t5_2rfxx,r/leagueoflegends,public,,0,[],

However, scaling is still effective even if the enemies don't totally outscale you. For example, level 200 enemies are still more difficult than level 40 even if you can kill them. Also, they can just reduce the effectiveness of our scaling damage like how Vauban's shrapnell is not OHK at high levels. But besides that...

Why does a soft cap have to exist, though?

It's reasonable to have soft caps if the missions rely on a key system (e.g. old void) so that players don't damage the economy. But since Warframe doesn't have anything like that now, it doesn't do anything other than forcing high level players to rely on weird strategies like waiting for enemies to ""time out"" in interception missions.

* [Time](https://liquipedia.net/overwatch/Bian_Yutao): He said he was going to learn driving...
* [Huamao](https://liquipedia.net/overwatch/Zhou_Xiaolong): He was fooled.
* Roy: The team is not closing down, they will recruit new members. As for rest of the KR players, some are still interested in new professional opportunities, and the transfer fees are not expensive.
* [Alan](https://liquipedia.net/overwatch/Gai_Yandahan): JJANU is free-agent, though.
* Time: I made some confirmation, they will probably just acquire a team in NAOC.
* Roy: Transfer fees for some players are really low but *(Titans)* still agreed, really ""good value"" *(for other teams).*
* Time: As far as I know, two players has been taken already.
* Roy: Also I heard Titans were in touch with GEN.G, so the new roster may not be full-American/Canadian/European.
* Alan: I can't get it, why did they announce one by one?
* Huamao: Maybe some are taken while others are not.
* Time: Two of them are taken, Ryu is retiring, and the rest will probably continue their career as they did not express the motivation to move to another game. Haskal is already taken.

Stąd wynikają 2 fale zachorowań rocznie zimą na półkuli południowej i północnej (z tym że oczywiście grypa nadal funkcjonuje cały rok wszędzie, mówimy tutaj o zachorowaniach w kontekście całej populacji). 

Na dodatek szczepionki są dość lokalne, tzn. np. szczepionka w tym samym sezonie dla Unii Europejskiej i dla Ameryki Północnej może się nieznacznie różnić pod kątem konkretnych szczepów. Szczepów w liczbie mnogiej, bo są to szczepionki poliwalentne, czyli takie które chronią przed kilkoma szczepami grypy. Najczęściej stosowana jest nadal trójwalentna, rzadziej czterowalentna. Dla sezonu 19/20 w Unii rekomendowane był szczepy A/Brisbane/02/2018,  A/Kansas/14/2017 i B/Colorado/06/2017. W czterowalentnej dodatkowo był albo  B/Yamagata/16/88, albo B/Phuket/3073/2013.

Okej, ale co to jest np. ""B/Phuket/3073/2013"". ""B"" oznacza wirusa grypy typu B, ""Phuket"" to miejsce gdzie dany wirus został wyizolowany (Phuket w Tajlandii), ""3073"" to numer szczepu. Tak, trzy tysiące siedemdziesiąt trzy szczepy... Na koniec masz rok z którego dany wirus pochodzi (2013). W kontekście wirusów typu A masz trochę inny podział na subgrupy. Stąd np. A/Brisbane/02/2018 należy do podtypu H1N1, czyli tego samego do którego zaliczał się wirus 'hiszpanki', czy też 'świńskiej grypy'.

Zmierzam do tego, że mówiąc 'grypa' mówimy o chorobie wywoływanej przez tysiące różnych (chociaż spokrewnionych) wirusów. Koronawirusy nie mutują w ten sam sposób - nadal mamy do czynienia z SARS-CoV-2, oczywiście z regionalnymi wariantami ale nie na tyle istotnymi żeby szukać analogii z grypą. Na dodatek wirus ten doskonale radzi sobie w wyższych temperaturach dlatego nie ma co oczekiwać sezonowości spowodowanej zmianami pór roku.

 'Ta choroba' zakończy się albo gdy ok. 80-85%  populacji ją przebędzie (wersja katastrofalna) albo gdy opracowana zostanie szczepionka. Oczywiście nadal istnieje ryzyko, że np. za 10 lat pojawi się SARS-CoV-3, ale będziemy wychodzili wtedy z zupełnie innego punktu wyjścia. Ba, gdybyśmy  nie porzucili prac nad SARS-CoV-1 prawdopodobnie nie mielibyśmy dzisiaj aż takich problemów zarówno w kontekście szczepionki, jak i leczenia.

* Whilst yes, the American economy grows faster than either all other economies or most, Germany's growth is still nowhere near ""bad"". If economy and growth is all that matters, then it's clear you listen to a lot of right-wing propaganda. (Not saying I support the left. Both sides create a lot of propaganda.) Like I said, plenty of European economies are still going strong and growing. Not as fast as the U.S., but that isn't going to kill our quality of life. We still *are* growing.
* Our standards? Firstly, Europe is an entire continent. Saying Europe's standards is stupid, since some nations like Russia have low standards, meanwhile nations like Switzerland have standards better than the U.S. could ever hope to have. Yes, America has the most freedom of speech in the world, but other than that 75% of the time Europe isn't below American standards.
* We do as good as your poorest states? You really need to get outside of the U.S.A., or just read actually non-American propaganda. Take Norway for example: Way higher salaries/income for the average Norwegian than the average American, way more equality, MUCH higher living standards, far superior social services, way more happy (the claim that Scandinavia isn't as happy as indexes say is just wrong. I've already seen the Janteloven arguments, and I can confirm it's not what people claim), far less corruption, and way more. Don't believe this? If so, you sound like an excessive patriot, aka you deny facts because you can't accept your nation not being #1. And Google it for yourself, because it's a known fact quality of life is, on average, higher in Norway than in the U.S. Yeah, a lot of the generally considered ""best"" European nations are far more expensive than America, but the amount of money you have isn't all that matters in life. Plus, the high income rate makes up for the price of living.
* Switzerland, Austria, all the Nordic nations, Germany, BeNeLux, Ireland, Estonia, etc. are far better in quality of life than Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, New Mexico, etc. Don't believe me? Google the living standards, happiness rates, etc. Yeah, those states do still have pretty fair income rates, in comparison to their European counterparts, but remember that the high inequality of America makes sure a lot of the population don't get anywhere near that income. Also remember money isn't the same as a good life. Life is a lot more than money, but according to you income rates and economic growth is the only way to live the best life.
* Average American doing better than the average European? Well firstly, America isn't the only place where you can thrive as a human. Believe it or not, but at the end of the day you definitely are aware most people in the world live decent lives. Iran is under a ruthless dictatorship and has lots of problems, but the people are still some of the most generous in the world, in general happy, and live normal lives just like everyone else. The Chinese live good lives, the Russians, Turkish, etc. Secondly, Europe has 700-800 million people (can't remember anything close to the exact number). America like what, 329 million? Not a very good comparison. And even if we look at the EU, then saying Americans are better off than Europeans shows your lack of knowledge of countries outside America. Here in Denmark, for example, it's definitely far better than your poorest states. Dare I say your richest states. Because guess what, a huge percentage of Americans can basically be considered definitely poor or essentially poor. Probably around 35-45%. Just look at the inequality rate for yourself. Anyways, why is Denmark better? Well, it's far happier, has a strong income rate, some of the best living standards in the world, the education is better than most nations' (saying better than most because education is generally still very bad in most nations), there's private healthcare and education for anyone who doesn't like the public ones, Denmark is a world leader with rights and freedom, and so many more things. In general, Denmark is actually higher than the U.S. in the vast majority of those categories. Google it.
* At the end of the day, I don't literally mean Europe is doing better than America, since it being better is entirely subjective. Make the average American live in Europe for a year, and they'll probably still prefer America -- which is completely fine. Make the average European live in America for a year, and they'll probably still prefer Europe. It's how it works. People will always prefer their birth nation, and thus Americans aren't ""better off"" than Europeans. That's just retarded. Because they'd prefer whichever they consider themselves from.

But hey, if you want to make shitty arguments to why America is better than Europe, go ahead. We live in a free world. At the end of the day Austria, Switzerland, Ireland, the Nordic countries, and BeNeLux have higher living standards than America, are happier, have more equality, better education, etc. That's a literal fact you can search up for yourself. Yeah, individually America would do a lot better, with states like Pennsylvania, Minnesota, California, etc. probably being around as high on those categories as their European counterparts, but to say the average American has it better than the average European is retarded. If you want to brag about America's GDP, economic growth, and high living standards for some states and the upper classes, then do it. But don't act like you actually know how life in Europe is. You clearly don't.

Lots of good info and links even if you're not London based.  The /r/askuk wiki is also worth checking out, don't bother with the one on /r/unitedkingdom.

For financial stuff such as banking, insurance, loans, getting a car, getting a good mobile phone deal, utilities deals, cheap deals for general stuff, etc etc, refer to the website http://www.moneysavingexpert.com.  If either of your employers offer high street discount schemes use them.  We save 4% week in week out on our groceries by using gift cards that we buy.

For medical, you should by now have registered with a local GP (General Practitioner) close to where you live.  If you have not done so, you will need to to access medical facilities.  Find one at http://www.nhs.uk.  The same website lists dentists but NHS dentists (whilst much cheaper than private) are hard to find.  We do not have the US scheme where you go out and find a specialist doctors e.g. an OB if pregnant; instead it all goes through the GP first.

For emergency services, call 999 (although I hear 911 works too).

For getting around (once the virus dies down in the months to come), you must have noticed the enormous price difference in fuel for the car by now.  Once things get back to normal, the train may appeal for long distance travel.  Booking way the hell in advance (up to 3 months) generates way cheaper fares albeit fixed on a specific service on a use it or lose it basis.  Flexible tickets cost more.  Note that we are much stricter on drink driving than the US, both penalties wise and also culturally.

Budget airlines are a major thing in Europe and don't have Spirit Airline's asshole pricing strategies (if airlines ever get back off the ground again in the coming years once this pandemic calms down).  The major players out of the UK are Easyjet and Ryanair but others exist (for now at least) including Vueling, Wizz and Eurowings.  You can also take trains across Europe (under normal circumstances) - for anything to do with trains refer to the outstanding website http://www.seat61.com.  They are far beyond anything the US has, speeds over 150mph are common with a handful of lines cruising at 200mph.

If you're keen to avoid people when grocery shopping, I can definitely recommend the last 3 hours on Friday evenings for quiet time.

We have 8 bank holidays per year.  Two are in May, the next one is Friday next week (8th).

Fairy Liquid is identical to Dawn, just a different shade and smell.

We shut down totally for Xmas day.  No shops open, restaurants are pre-book only, no fast food outlets open.  Many pubs will be shut, others open just for a few hours in the afternoon.  If you want to eat out on Xmas day somewhere that's got a good reputation, try to book it before October.

After a certain time you will have to exchange your US licence for a UK one.  Consult http://www.gov.uk (which is the general government services portal) for help, or specifically https://www.gov.uk/driving-nongb-licence

EDIT: Thanksgiving is not a thing.  Search around for American expats if you want to make a thing of it.  Halloween is much less of a thing than it is in the US.  We go big for Guy Fawkes day on the 5th November; basically we burn effigies of a 17th century terrorist who tried to blow up parliament but who got snitched on before he could succeed.  Lots of fireworks get let off.  You'll find many organised events.  

If you want to see some crazy festivities in the UK assuming virus rules permit, look up bog snorkelling, glastonbury (which is cancelled for this year by the way, you have to pre-register months ahead and when they release tickets it sells out in about 90 minutes), tar rolling in ottery st mary or cheese rolling at cooper's hill.

She said she was outside the US, and for the price I am guessing Paris, London, or a main commerce city in Europe. In most places, the burden is on the owner of the house since the tenant is assumed as the weakest part. 

In some jurisdictions, you can not just kick out your so out for things unrelated to the tenant-owner relationship, for example.

For example, in some places, if he cheated, she can not kick him out as it is unrelated to the lease, and she will have to wait until the contract expires, he damages the apartment in some way, or he stops paying. In some places, if he had lived there for more than X amount of months, he is entitled an N period to leave. 

For this reason, some lawyers will recommend avoiding creating a tenant-landlord relationship when a relationship exists.

Source: My dad is American, and I pay his rent for valid reasons so. So I have some info to compare. The owner has very little rights other than the lease be paid in full and on time but has a lot of obligations. My mom is European and lives in LATAM (I pay her part of the rent, see below). I am European and have a place like two hours away from Frankfurt (I am the tenant my contract is pretty simple, but man do I have rights) and I own a small place in an area outside Madrid (partly owned, I have tenants I have a lot of weird obligation, for example, kicking someone out for not paying involves the law (municipality and sometimes the police) and takes a long time, with little expectations of me been paid for those months). 

I pay my mother a small rent because I have a room and a lot of my things in her house as she lives close to an airport-hub in the area that I use a lot to move around, and it makes sense for me to use. 

We have a contract, the contact is very straight forward and none-detailed but the law that governs it says things like (paraphrasing): the tenant is under no obligation as to the terms of the lease, but the owner is. Meaning I can walk from the contract whenever I want just losing the deposit.

Before the paranormal researcher organizations of the modern era there was the Cult of the Black Archive, an ancient secret society dedicated to keeping the esoteric forces and eldritch gods that plague our reality firmly hidden and contained. They operated across Europe, Africa, and Asia starting in the Late Bronze Age. They collapsed following an unknown catastrophe in the year 1 CE, eldritch influence is suspected. Very little is actually known about the group, apart from the fact that existed in the first place and that they were founded after stumbling across a library left by 


The setting is heavily populated by all manner of supernatural forces. There’s magic, eldritch deities (both roaming the cosmos and imprisoned on Earth), monsters, spirits, aliens, and pretty much every mythological creature exists in some form or another. Most of human history is pretty similar to our own, and the Cult did not have modern technology or anything even close, they were very much working with whatever tech ancient humanity had on-hand, though they could have some weapons that would seem as advanced for the time (i.e. crossbows rather than just bows and arrows). Also, around the time they were operating, gods were not actively roaming the Earth. The ones imprisoned there *could* have been manipulating humans in subtle ways and creating paranormal items and creatures of their own to influence events to their liking, but the Cult wasn’t annihilated by Cthulhu rising or something.

Perfect time for me from the day we start chatting to the day we marry is something like 6 months, but ofcourse its depends on many things

21yo. 5'11'' (181cm), 125lb (56kg), 6in (15cm). Slim body, long legs, dark brown hair, blue eyes

Look at my sexy pics [**here**](https://imgur.com/a/ETD54qJ)

I consider myself as confident, cute, honest, open and hopefully interesting person

Some of my main hobbies is videogames, playing guitar, surfing web/Youtube, reading, and of-course watching porn😏😁

I speak decent English, have enough practice of real time conversations

I'm ""perverted to the bone"". Slutty, open minded, bisexual, into all aspects of BDSM, have a lot of kinks, fetishes and dirty fantasies😈

I do webcamming (check my profile, can't post here) for more than a year already, i like to do it especially when i get paid lol 😄

My nature is submissive/bottom for a Man, and switch for girls/Tgirls. I'm not interested to dominate my Husband, but if you will really want it, i think you can convince me😏

I want to be a good wife, pleasure my Husband needs, be supportive, loving and caring for him , and yes i can cook, clean and help in house

I fell myself as girl from pretty young age, and at 18yo i fully admit that i need transition, i need to look and live life as sexy girl, but i will keep my girlcook for sure😉

Sadly i'm not on HRT yet, because of my place and situation, but i already do everything i can for my transition, learning feminine voice, makeup, walking on heels, training myself to give good sex, have a long girly hair and always full body shave

I have a desire to be bimboficated, especially in the appearance part, but nothing too much and crazy

Also i would like to become pornactress at home/amateur pornactress that mean i will webcamming, selling videos on sites, having a hot Instagram and etc. - but this is something what i can discuss about with my Husband, if he is don't want it

Conversely, most of the 'high-consuming' developed world has a very small share of total emissions. Around 2% for most European nations, for instance.

https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/each-countrys-share-co2-emissions

Btw, China's emissions for producing products for the west are only 16% of their 30% global total. Or 4.8% of world emissions.

Edit: 

Also, let’s be clear by what is actually meant when we talk about the West’s ‘consumption’.

A homeless person in the US has double the carbon footprint of the global average, simply because of the services they use.

https://scienceblog.com/16130/carbon-footprint-of-different-lifestyles-including-homeless/

You cannot reduce your consumption below that of a homeless person. It’s the sheer cost of supporting this many people, which can only be done with industrialization. If you get your food from a grocery store, if you store it in a refrigerator, if you cook it with a stove, if you eat it by the light of an electric bulb, then your 'consumption' is much higher than anyone in the developing world.

To be clear, I'm not saying that we shouldn't change our western lifestyles (I mean at this point it's too late to matter, but for the sake of the hypothetical). Just pointing out that 'reducing consumption' in any kind of meaningful way means 97% of us living on a farm without electricity, doing manual labor.

We see this not only in Ukraine, but in Georgia and Moldova where Russia supports independence movements in tiny enclaves to ensure a lack of territorial integrity.  Since territorial integrity is a requirement for joining NATO, this prevents NATO's progression toward Russia's borders and leaves them with a buffer.  The Baltic states are fortunate that they were able to integrate with both the EU and NATO during a period where Russia lacked the capacity to prevent such a move.

Certamente que a faculdade tem a sua parcela de responsabilidade para a formação do profissional.

Existem faculdades boas e referências e existem faculdades com baixa qualidade.

Existe de parcela de responsabilidade da faculdade, existe a parcela de responsabilidade do aluno.

O YouTube está recheado de vídeos de pessoas com **depoimentos sobre cursos e faculdades.** É legal dar uma olhadinha.

&amp;#x200B;

***Sobre a escolha da faculdade,*** vou deixar algumas perguntas que podem te ajudar.

&amp;#x200B;

* Quais são as 5 principais opções (se elas existem)?
* Qual a vantagem de cada opção?
* O que garante que a faculdade vai atender o seu objetivo, o que ela vai oferecer?

&amp;#x200B;

***Sobre carreira no setor privado*****,** existe alguns fatores que somam para uma boa colocação profissional, como o **networking.**

*Como fazer isso?*

Na área profissional, o **Linkedin** ganha destaque como rede para contatos profissionais. Portanto, se você usar bem essa plataforma, portas podem se abrir. 

Ela é um local, que se bem trabalhado, o ‘correr atrás’ pode aumentar o seu sucesso.

Por exemplo, você pode escrever artigos, que outras pessoas irão ler e elas podem gostar e identificar você como uma autoridade no assunto. Além de outros modos de usar a ferramenta. 

Isso pode fazer desde os primeiros períodos da faculdade, é preciso ter algum assunto como domínio e que as pessoas gostem. 

&amp;#x200B;

No LinkedIn, **existem milhares de perfis profissionais de Advogados.** 

Lá você pode ver onde eles se graduaram, cursos que fizeram, onde trabalharam. Isso pode te trazer uma luz sobre bons caminhos, o que as pessoas fizeram. 

Claro, tem profissionais bem-sucedidos e outros profissionais sem tanto êxito. É bom procurar os melhores perfis.

Em suma, procure um pouco mais sobre as vantagens do LinkedIn. Não fique somente com o que eu escrevi aqui.

&amp;#x200B;

***Sobre ser rico,*** isso depende dos caminhos que você escolher.

Por hora, minha opinião é você não se fechar na possibilidade de ganhar dinheiro e nem alimentar tantas expectativas. Se você quiser isso, é legal observar o que as pessoas no Direito fazem para ser ricas, dentro da área de seu interesse, e que são bem-sucedidas eticamente.

Se você já fechar as portas sobre ser rico, dificilmente será. O convite é observar, sem colocar mais barreiras sobre a riqueza no Direito.

&amp;#x200B;

***Sobre ascenção profissional***

Essa pergunta vai te auxiliar a buscar mais precisamente o que você quer.

* O que faz que alguém, dentro da área que você quer, obtenha ascenção profissional? Liste 3 pontos importantes

https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/gaofbo/for_female_circumcision_see_female_genital/fp1zug4/

The commonly claimed benefits of circumcision are that it reduces the risk of getting UTIs, penile cancer, and prevents STDs. These claims are based on reports made by the American Association of Pediatrics. But there is a lot of criticism regarding their research. The important points are mentioned below:

It takes around 100 circumcisions to prevent a single UTI, and UTIs can be treated easily by other less invasive ways, like antibiotics. Not to mention, it is easily prevented with basic hygiene. 1 case of UTI may be prevented at the cost of 2 cases of haemorrhage, infection, or, in rare instances, more severe outcomes or even death. This negates whatever minuscule protective benefit circumcision might have against UTIs. And it should be noted that girls are about 10 times more likely to get UTIs and yet we do not alter their bodies to reduce their risk of infection

Penile cancer is one of the rarest forms of cancer in the Western world (∼1 case in 100,000 men per year, rarer than male breast cancer), almost always occurring at a later age with the average being 68. When diagnosed early, the disease generally has a good survival rate. 

According to the AAP report, between 909 and 322,000 circumcisions are needed to prevent 1 case of penile cancer. Penile cancer is linked to infection with HPV, which can be prevented without tissue loss through condom use and prophylactic inoculation. Incidence rates of penile cancer in the United States, where ∼75% of the non-Jewish, non-Muslim male population is circumcised, are similar to rates in northern Europe, where ≤10% of the male population is circumcised

The studies that claim circumcision prevents STDs often confuse correlation with causation. In fact, circumcision might increase the risk of contracting STDs, because it can cause pain and bleeding, increasing the risk of infection. The authors of the AAP report forget to stress that responsible use of condoms, regardless of circumcision status, will provide close to 100% reduction in risk for any STD

Another common claim is that circumcision reduces the risk of men contracting HIV by 60%. These were the results of some trials done in Africa, which found that 2.5% of intact men and 1.3% of circumcised men got HIV. The 60% figure is the relative risk (2.5%-1.2%)÷2.5%. 

The AAP also ignored the statistics showing that there was a 61% relative increase (6% absolute increase) in HIV infection among female partners of circumcised men. It appears that the number of circumcisions needed to infect a woman was 16.7, with one woman becoming infected for every 17 circumcisions performed

Moreover, there were several methodological errors in these trials:

The circumcised experimental group got more medical care, including education on the proper use of condoms

The trials were terminated early when statistical significance was reached

In one study, circumcised men's infection rates were increasing faster than the intact men's, until the study was terminated early

The circumcised group could not have sex for 4-6 weeks after the circumcision; this was excluded from the analysis and distorts the results
HIV was contracted through means other than sex
Many researchers had cultural and religious biases

The findings are also not in line with the fact that the United States combines a high prevalence of STDs and HIV infections with high circumcision rates. The situation in most European countries is the reverse: low circumcision rates combined with low HIV and STD rates. Therefore, other factors play a more important role in the spread of HIV than circumcision status. This also shows that there are alternate, less intrusive, and more effective ways of preventing HIV than circumcision, such as consistent use of condoms, safe-sex programs, easy access to antiretroviral drugs, and clean needle programs

Further criticism of the African RCTs:

Critique of African RCTs into Male Circumcision and HIV Sexual Transmission

Circumcision of male infants and children as a public health measure in developed countries: A critical assessment of recent evidence
Sexually Transmitted Infections and Male Circumcision: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis

Even if circumcision did reduce rates of HIV transmission, which it doesn't, it would be a small reduction. “The number needed to [circumcise] to prevent one HIV infection varied, from 1,231 in white males to 65 in black males, with an average in all males of 298. The model did not account for the cost of complications of circumcision. In addition, there is a risk that men may overestimate the protective effect of being circumcised and be less likely to adopt safe sex practices.”

And besides all of that, babies are not having sex. They are not transmitting ANY STDs to anyone. By the time a person is old enough to engage in sexual activities, they are old enough to decide about such body modifications for themselves

Balanitis is extremely rare. Having a surgical incision in a dirty diaper increases the risk of balanitis. This risk decreases in all males drastically after puberty. It is easily preventable with good hygiene and most cases respond to treatment in under a week

Phimosis doesn't warrant circumcision. It can be cured by stretching the foreskin gently at regular intervals. For faster results, steroid creams can also be used. If stretching doesn't work, surgery like Z-plasty and preputioplasty can be done as a last resort. None of these treatments results in the loss of tissue. Moreover, some doctors misdiagnose phimosis in young children, when they're supposed to have foreskins which can't retract, until puberty, though in some cases the foreskin becomes retractable earlier. Improper handling of the foreskins of children can cause phimosis

""An estimated 0.8% to 1.6% of boys will require circumcision before puberty, most commonly to treat phimosis. The first-line medical treatment of phimosis involves applying a topical steroid twice a day to the foreskin, accompanied by gentle traction ... allow[ing] the foreskin to become retractable in 80% of treated cases, thus usually avoiding the need for circumcision.""

Smegma and hygiene are ridiculous reasons for circumcision. Properly washing the penis is enough. If you don't wash your junk, it will get dirty, period. Foreskins aren't releasing a constant ooze of smegma. You would have to neglect your basic hygiene for some time to get a significant buildup. And even then, washing takes maybe a second or two. It's not rocket science

The legitimacy of research supporting circumcision

The literature review by the American Academy of Pediatrics, which supports circumcision, does not mention any of the functions of the foreskin, implying that it is useless

Ethicist Brian Earp shows how scientific literature can be filled with bias, how medical literature can get biased with controversial opinions disguised as systematic reviews, and how a small group of researchers with an agenda can rig a systematic review in medicine to make it say whatever they want.

Opposition to circumcision by foreign medical organizations

Other medical associations and doctors in the world, from the Netherlands, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, Germany, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, Slovenia and South Africa have stated that circumcision causes complications, have also said that the evidence supporting circumcision is insufficient and flawed, and consider the AAP's views scientifically unsound. Some of them have gone on record in opposition to non-therapeutic circumcision of boys. Some doctors in the US oppose it too

Functions of the Foreskin

The foreskin has several unique physiological functions. The foreskin represents at least a third of the penile skin. It protects the glans from abrasion and contact with clothes. It also increases sexual pleasure by sliding up and down on the shaft, stimulating the glans by alternately covering and exposing it. Not to mention that it is highly erogenous tissue in and of itself.

Attempts to legitimize FGM

Another issue with using ""health benefits"" to justify infant male circumcision is that the same poor reasons given for baby boys are the same reasons being used in attempts to legalize and legitimize FGM on girls. They will try and use the logic that: ""If it is legal on boys because there are slight medical benefits, then it should be legal and acceptable for girls as well.""",False,False,False,,,0,1588364269,,False,0,{},fp757p5,False,t3_gbceog,False,True,t1_fp5zfc0,/r/daddit/comments/gbceog/circumcision_guilt/fp757p5/,False,,1594782575,1,True,False,daddit,t5_2rxue,r/daddit,public,,0,[],

The highest in the world is 63.2 (Lesotho), and there are only 23 countries in the world with greater inequality than China. USA is almost as unequal as China at 45, but it is is an outlier among ""the West"". In comparison, Sweden is 24.9, Germany is 27, France 29.3, Australia 30.3, Canada 32.1, UK 32.4.

2 - Most developed countries, apart from the US, have free healthcare and free education up to university level. (NB: In the UK, you pay tuition fees but for 99% of people this comes from a ""student loan"" which is backed by the government. The loan is cancelled after 20 years if you can't pay it back, and you don't pay any of it back if you don't earn above a certain threshold. This means fees are no barrier to education. Other European countries have no tuition fees at all.) The US is an exception because they got arrogant from being ""numba one"" and didn't think they needed to reform. They're wrong, and they are not the standard nearer for democracy. 

3 - Most western countries have strong trade unions and legal systems. There is some coverage in Chinese media of labour unrest in Europe, and strikes, portrayed as chaos. In actual fact, these are the reasons for high degrees of equality and people do not get exploited by their bosses so much - e.g. Tenants have rights and cannot be easily evicted by their landlords, and bosses cannot fire their employees with no good reason, and if they do they can be taken to court. 

It's also worth noting that some of the most equal countries like Germany and Sweden don't have much labour unrest, and that is a result of stronger trade unions, and therefore don't need to strike. Workers vote for trade union representatives who sit in company board meetings to represent their interests. IMO these countries are the closest to socialism in the world, and China is one of the furthest countries from socialism in the world - China is a fascist country, and workers therefore have no right to organise. Socialists in the west fought and died to defeat fascism for the very reason that it crushed democracy and made it impossible for workers to organise, and as a socialist I would fight and die to stop ""Socialism with Chinese Characteristics"" spreading to my country. IMO, the CCP is the greatest enemy of socialism in the world today.

Lol, this statement alone pretty much invalidates everything you said.

Switzerland has some of the laxest gun laws in Europe and a pretty positive attitude overall towards firearms and is usually the country invoked when talking about gun control.

But it doesn't surprise me that reactionaries like you can't tell the difference, having never stepped foot in either country. Thanks for proving my point I guess.

And when progress does happen it is almost always forced by external factors leaving people no other choice.  Take for instance the first  cities which appeared right around 5500 years ago coinciding directly with the end of the Wet period in North Africa in the Middle East. This was triggered by precession but unlike previous cycles it was severely exacerbated by livestock overgrazing triggering far more rapid desertification turning much of the region from savanna to desert in less than a century. This forced refugees to flee the drying rivers to the few rivers which didn't dry up like the Nile or the Tigris and Euphrates systems which forced human populations for the first time to live in larger communities beyond just their tribe. Had it not been for this climatic trigger who can say whether cities would ever have been developed given our species had remained nomadic for millions of years.

We are living within a rare period of history where progress has become self reinforcing but this is only really existed for the last 300 or so years and had been driven by a series of coincidences enabling it to happen by removing historical factors which have retarded societal advancement previously.

This advancement was in turn a consequence of thousands of years of cultural purging of preexisting social structures by the catholic church
which promoted individuality over collectivist ideology, the large scale  loss of population to the waves of the black death opening up opportunities for social migration,this in turn lead to a weakening of the nobility enabling kings to exercise far more political power and unity enabling the rise of nations and nationalism as a political ideology. Add into the mix emerging navel technologies allowing far more extensive trade than previously possible given ships in Europe, and the rising middle class and that set the stage for a new  enlightenment driven study to emerge which would fuel rediscovery of old technologies and new developments and ideas spurring the evolution of the philosophy with social contract theory, and quite importantly the scientific method.  Throw other factors in such as the protestant reformation weakening the power of the church leaving a societal vacuum which allowed rapid divergence from preexisting cultural norms and a desire for disenfranchised groups to go elsewhere driving expansion.

While many of these events have causal connections all of these particular outcomes needed key chance events to spur them down these paths to begin with.

Without the catholic church breaking up and weakening familial clan structures compared to what they had been in the past due to the church viewing marriage among cousins as being incest the information exchange
that enabled the renaissance and enlightenment movements which set into motion the cycle of self enforcing progress.


Progress is not a linear process we must be careful to not place our current circumstances and mind sets on historical civilizations as this is a well known flaw of human psychology.  This is in fact the same mechanism why older generations have always claimed that the youth have become far more degenerate/ungrateful compared to when their generation were kids etc. as it neglects that as we grow older with tend to think differently. 

We are the consequences of thousands of coincidences, lucky breaks, unfortunate circumstances and the likes. We have evolved to spin everything into narratives which retroactively enforces the notion of inevitability but science tells us it isn't so simple. humans have always been innovative developing new innovations and ideas back well before written history but these insights have historically been lost largely due to the clan and master apprentice systems which both act to suppress the exchange of information treating it as something valuable to horde rather than share. This lack of sharing not only increases the risk of technologies getting lost often because a clan destroys it to prevent it from falling into the hands of outsiders or a master failing to pass on all their knowledge for various reasons remotely similar to what we have experienced..  Without this dispersal our modern society would never have happened at least not in a way remotely similar to our current rate of progress.",True,False,False,,,0,1588366930,,False,0,{},fp7ado3,False,t3_gbg416,False,False,t3_gbg416,/r/worldbuilding/comments/gbg416/i_feel_like_my_world_given_time_would_turn_out/fp7ado3/,False,,1594785136,4,True,False,worldbuilding,t5_2rd6n,r/worldbuilding,public,,0,[],

It is either sold or distributed free-of-charge in 35 countries, including various international regional editions. The Epoch Times websites are blocked in mainland China.

&gt;The media outlet is primarily known for promoting far-right politicians across Europe and the United States, and in particular for its promotion of U.S. President Donald Drumpf; a 2019 report showed it to be the second-largest funder of pro-Drumpf Facebook advertising after the Drumpf campaign.[10][11][12][13] The group's news sites and YouTube channels have spread conspiracy theories such as QAnon and anti-vaccination propaganda.

Quite literally this is far-right conservative propaganda.
Why is it in your mailbox? It's in _everyones_ mailbox in your neighbourhood most likely.

A print run and mailing /distribution of even several hundred thousand copies across the GTA doesn't actually cost that much. I mean, thousands yes. But the people who are behind this don't worry about the thousands of $$, they worry about the $Billions. And to get the $Billions all they have to do is win a their preferred party a few more seats in the House of Commons, get a few more trade laws or tariffs to go their way. And all that takes is convincing a few people like you that perhaps the governing party needs to change or perhaps you'll write your Senator or perhaps you should join their Facebook group and attend a rally. 

This is what propaganda in the 21st century looks like.

Não parece ser um dicionário muito extenso, mas tem a escrita normal e a escrita fonética pra pronúncias de alguns lugares diferentes (Lisboa, Rio, São Paulo, Luanda). Se eles não tiverem um arquivão com tudo, dá pra montar um crawlerzinho que extrai tudo pra um dataset e brincar com isso.

Eu tentaria filtrar por apenas palavras que tenham pronúncia idêntica em qualquer região, e em seguida filtraria qualquer palavra com acentos (possibilita que a palavra seja escrita corretamente em qualquer sistema e diminui a chance de erros). Isso já te daria um conjunto bem mais restrito de palavras pra usar.

Aí pode cair em umas situações de palavras que, apesar de terem a escrita fonética diferente, soam parecidas, o que poderia gerar confusão. Aqui eu passo estar falando uma merda gigantesca pq não sei do que tô falando, teria que falar com algum linguista pra te auxiliar, mas acho que rola isso sim.

Dont spend gems on gear ever. 
Logically you should have full s lvl60 costume page beside wings by now right ? 

Dont refine non + gear, you will replace that soon anyway and the small power gain isnt worth it.

Create all characters if you havent already, and claim all daily stuff to spend on your main.

Fuse weapons, armors and accessories to try and have atleast s++ 08 gear, ideally 09. Work through adventure mode to get access to magicites (chapter 23 iirc).

Dont forget to check out the trophy shop where you can get a free s++ for 90 trophies (shop 8).

Given that you dont really have anything to spend gems on at this time, i would personally try and buy costume deco and pray you get s+ or s++ wings (good for a couple of hundred k of cp)

Finale advice, grind like crazy.

Also, we have a guild in EU that finishes decently on all events and guildwars every week. Always top 50 atleast, usually better. Our requierement is 8m cp, but we do have a guild for all of our alts that is free tojoin. It has all max level buffs available etc. You could join that one and once you growjoin our bigguild if you are into pvp.

Trust me you really won't notice.

Also call me a liquid hater but AIOs are just not very reliable. They often fail between 2 and 4 years of use. Tower coolers basically don't wear out.

- Strongly consider upgrading to better memory. 3600 MHz/CAS 16 is ideal and should net a small but cheap performance boost. The higher spec Corsair kit is overpriced but G.Skill Trident Z Neo or RGB is about 130€.

1. It makes it sound like whites or those of European heritage are much thicker-skinned and less sensitive about representation issues.  A German typically has no problem having Germanic barbarians framed as bad-guys against Romans.  Likewise, other people, as long as the representation doesn't *seem* like an attack on the ethnicity as a whole will *mostly* be okay.
2. I think we should be *as* creative with non-European tropes as we are with European tropes.  It makes it really boring to represent Amerindian culture if you have to be 100% anthropologically accurate for a single nation.  There are lots of things you can do with language and culture which aren't the old, boring WASP stereotypes of native American, but which don't correspond neatly to one.  Feathers are a beautiful, accessible means by which to express status, beautify living spaces, connect with a god/ancestor; totem poles have universal analogues, can be a very special way to connect with ancestors/express status, mark territory, worship...

I think you're being a bit too restrictive and like I implied in my last response to you, good judgment here and respect towards people that exist today should be guiding principles; beyond that, it is important to remember that someone somewhere **will** be offended (either representation will be interpreted as offensive, inaccurate, or the lack of representation as a whole will be bemoaned).

&gt;Modern racism came into being during the ironically-named Enlightenment, as a justification of European domination over non-European people.

Scientific Racism did not come into being *as a justification* for colonial imperialism. It came into being because the Reformation had eroded the authority of the church and it's dogmatic teachings on the nature of the world, and so for the first time since the fall of Rome, European peoples began to try to understand the world as it is, not as Pope et. al. said it was. They placed emphasis on material explanations for the way things were, and above all, the scientific method. Naturally, in the absence of data and the history of practice, most the models they created confirmed priors. What is important here is that for the first time they were *trying* and honestly so. They were not simply using this opportunity to justify to themselves their immorality - on the whole their conclusions were from earnest, if misguided, attempts to understand why things were the way they were without respect to the church fathers (they wanted to know why were europeans so 'advanced', and others so 'primitive').

In broad strokes, pre-Enlightment Europe peoples were a deeply racist people, as all peoples have more or less been for as far back as we can see (evolution certainly selected for the [parochial altruism](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04981) trait). But, Carl Linnaeus did not come up with the five 'varieties' of human species in 1767 *because* he was some devilish profiteer who needed to find a justification for european imperialism. He was doing so in a good-faith effort to understand the nature human-kind, according to what facts were available to him. To quote Stephen Jay Gould, Linnaeus' taxa, ""was not in the ranked order favored by most Europeans in the racist tradition,"" adding further, ""I don't mean to deny that Linnaeus held conventional beliefs about the superiority of his own European variety over others...nevertheless, and despite these implications, the overt geometry of Linnaeus' model is not linear or heirarchical."" 


So, while it is certainly a fact that 'scientific racism' came into being with the Enlightenment, it is *not a fact* that it came into being just so euros could carry on with their dirty deeds, which is the tone and explicit meaning of your original statement. What's more, the Enlightenment is justifiably named (not 'ironically-named'). We should celebrate the fact that we inherit their tradition, despite the inaccuracy of their early conclusions. What is important is the method and the absence of religious dogmatism. If anything, we should thank the Enlightenment for planting the seeds (as is evident in Linnaeus' non-hierarchical taxa), that would allow us to rise above the tribalism that has gripped humanity for all of it's existence.

Both of voltage description ""U"" and ""V"" are proper, however it must be mentioned that in European notation ""U"" describes voltage source while ""V"" describes rather voltage potential. It means that U = V1 - V1 (voltage is a difference between voltage potentials). I agree that in IEEE and American standards voltage is described by ""V"" letter.
Very similar situation is with other electric symbols also (e.g. resistors, capacitors, current sources, etc.), where European and American standards are different.

Likewise much of what we know including the HTTP and web protocols were CERN. CERN apparently loved using NeXTSTEP though which was ahead of the game. 

Although in some ways it's nice to have global coverage and that's how we view the internet today; the other poster seems to confuse the inter- with the concept of international. Other countries is irrelevant to what the concept of a packet switched network that can route traffic and have many host and clients interdependently of the medium for communication between multiple networks - which is what the internet is. It's in general a set of protocols for interconnectivity amongst various networks. It doesn't matter if no other countries were connected or not. There are pros and cons to that and not every country technically is still. The main purpose was to be able to have various networks at various institutions be able to communicate with each-other, that's it. That the internet is largely global is simply a byproduct of the usefulness of the nature of that sort of thing. You could have your own country wide only internet, it wouldn't be ""THE"" internet, but it would an internet. It's a step up from the old time-sharing systems and the one to one connectivity that preceded it that were still often fairly specific.

Minecraft i've been playing since around 2011/2012 (i started about 1-2 patches before emeralds and bats were added) i have countless i mean COUNTLESS memories of that game, it's a game that whenever i feel bored or need something to play it's a game i can always count on to be there for me. Like a friend, i mean countless worlds, countless friends i've made. Any time i play the game it all comes back to me, i still build like shit and suck at redstone but.... It's just nice to reminisce, even though all of the friends i had on MC drifted away, i still have around 1-2 on Steam but they haven't been online in a while. I just hope wherever they are, they're safe and... I just want them to know whenever i feel down i always think of the good times we had together

World of Warcraft is a game i've been playing since 2014 maybe even earlier, right around before the release of Warlords (i know, great introduction right?) but my relationship with Warcraft goes back to being a kid and playing W3 and the original DOTA, i blame my brother who introduced me to it of course. And i remember watching him play Warcraft, i wasn't big on mmos but one day i just decided, why not i'll try it. The rest is history, i've spent countless nights i could've gotten laid just chilling and sometimes venting about problems. My guild was always there for me, and i was always there for them. I've met bounds of interesting and unique people, hell i think i saved some from suicide. I'm not a very social person IRL so most of the friends i did make were on WOW or Minecraft... Sadly much like the Minecraft situation we all just drifted away, i don't know why but one day i came on and all my Bnet friends were gone. Just disappeared, and i miss em. Hopefully one day we'll reunite in Azeroth... Hell they might even see this, so if you played a Draenei Discipline Priest on Icecrown US called Chaktaw between like 2014- early 2015. Do you remember a little gnome warrior you rented way too much gold to? i still need to pay you back on that haha.... There was also a Draenei Mage on EU, i don't remember the server but she was an actual gamer girl. I swear to god, she was probably the first WOW friend i made. But i moved to US servers and we never talked again, I'm pretty sure they quit the game and haven't come back yet but.... Whenever i visit the Draenei starting zone or Stormwind... I think of them

Oh there was also a Tauren Paladin i believe on... EU Horde i want to say? that got my little Troll to the Dark Portal at level 6, i was dead by the time we reached it but that was the first time i saw it. And it's a special moment, thankfully i uploaded a screenshot to my FB of that moment so.... At least one of my fond memories is forever immortalized on the Internet....

That's about it tho, I could also include Skyrim maybe. But that's singleplayer and i didn't learn anything profound.... Except of course

When everyone else is sitting at home watching TV Shows after work or playing video games, I decided to start my own side business, I remembered, investing $800 to purchase stock/inventory, its been over 3 years now, the side business pays 30% of my household expenses (home business). Plus all directors withdrawals goes to utilities. My day time job pay goes towards the mortgage and only small part goes towards groceries.   If i keep this going, I should be able to retire by 39 years old with a freehold house in Auckland. 

Everyone mindset is different, my co-worker mindset is to rest and relax during the weekend. But my goal is to retire earlier, so i have to work during the weekend, go around collection plastics Jerry cans, washing and rinsing them, selling as used water Jerry cans. I can easily make $50-80 per week, that goes towards my financial freedom, but not many people will get up early on the weekend and do what I do, because they don't have goals or vision.  

I had this mindset of been retired before 40 years, when i was 22 years old.

My first job out of Uni, I had to report to my work group accountant, she was a lovely lady in her early late 40's, I randomly as her about job security and i want to stay for this company as long as i can. She said bluntly, ""I don't care if I get fired, I don't need to work, but i choose to work""  It got me very interested, in my mind, how the hell can someone say that, she must be loaded with $$, few months passed, I got to know more and more, by asking her questions during breaks. She mentioned to me, her and the husband before they got marriage, in there late 20's, came up with a plan, they sat down and wrote on an A3 piece pf paper, a ""Action Vision Plan"" one point she wrote was 'I want to retire before 50', underneath that, there were steps/actions, she told me they both agreed and wrote  down, the following: 

1. Increase Income
2. Passive income 
3. Invest in real estate 
4. Spend only on necessities, the rest goes into investment or savings account
5. Frugal living 

After half of year, she opened up even more, she told me she bought her first house with her husband and they rented out rooms for the first 3 years, and then they moved to Europe because her husband scored a high paying job,  once her husband contract was over/expired in Europe they moved to Australia.  While they were doing all this, they keep their first house and rented it out. They came back and bought more houses, she told during her weekends she will go out with her husband to view open homes, learn and study the market, this was when before the housing boom in Auckland, she bought stand alone houses and use her equity and bought a commercial building in Auckland. 

2 years later, she got fired, now she is working at home as an accountant for few clients, the rest of her time she just studies, always learning new things, coding, website development. Her husband is retired and spends most of his days reading books or gardening.  I went and visit her last year, she built a new 2 story house down the back on an existing section, the front house paid all the unities plus left surplus for her house new house. She doesn't have any kids, so she is very generous and pays schooling for her sister kids and helps out her brother when she needs help. 

So inspiration, I had to tell me my girl friend, we learn't from her and wrote a Action Vision plan also. Couple of the points, we (GF and I) agreed on is increase our income and only spend money on necessitates, but we did splurge out end of last year on a washer and dryer combo Fisher and Paykel, our washing machine died, so we ended up getting a washer and dryer combo, but we hunted down bargain rather than paying retail price of $2499 we paid only $992 delivered, because the boxed was damaged, the washing machine was perfectly fine.

&gt; Yeah it is. It’s literally just a film. You grew up as a spawn of the corporatization and greasy assfucking of the corpse of that film. 

Asinine take. Star Wars would have been a waste of worldbuilding without allowing further development of the galaxy far, far away. Hell, your argument could be used to say that even ESB and ROTJ shouldn't exist.

&gt;  it's a multimedia franchise,
&gt; No. 

I'm just going to quote you on this one.

&gt; Zero argument. This means nothing.

It was funny though, so there's that.

&gt; Yeah exactly George was a fucking hack. The writing was on the walls the entire time. He spent the 90s shilling for his VFX company by shoving cartoon dinosaurs into the rereleases. He destroyed the franchise and sold it to Disney for parts.

I don't think you understand how much non-film media existed for the franchise before Lucas even got around to the Special Edition edits.

&gt; No. Fuck no. And I guarantee you’ll probably do a 180 when it comes to criticizing the ST.

No. It's actually one of my biggest critiques with the ST, because the same EU canon wipe I criticized earlier left a 30-year void in the timeline that Lucasfilm filled with *Aftermath*, which was insultingly terrible and made the entire post-ROTJ Rebellion-to-Republic era of absolutely zero interest. It was one of the *most* interesting parts of the timeline before Disney wiped it.

&gt; they do that IN THE PREQUELS WHICH IS THEY THEY SUCK. He didn’t give a fuck about filmmaking or screenwriting or directing or editing or anything other than setting up franchises and expanding IP. And it shows.

You're simultaneously giving Lucas too much and too little credit here. I've criticized the prequels multiple times for only allowing three years for the Clone Wars, which is the time period that's seen the most extra-film content by far. Had this been some insidious plan from the outset, they wouldn't have pigeonholed themselves to that degree.

&gt; ...and to my point, all of that was integrated with existing canon with minor retcons,
&gt; No.

Gonna step out on a limb here and assume you haven't actually read any of the stuff you keep raging about, because this is where the rebuttal would normally go if you had one.

&gt; Worst thing in any Star Wars movie. And fuck you it was a goddamn joke. If you were the same edgy contrarian tween then that you are now, you’d be exactly what you are about the ST at the PT.

Work on your delivery. I'm not even sure what you're talking about in that second sentence. Maybe take a deep breath or something.

&gt; Again this is a discussion about FILM trilogies. Not pulp fiction trash that was being pumped out for decades to leach of the franchise. The Jedi Academy trilogy ruined fucking Jedi then. Fuck that retarded shit. It ruins Empire to say that the Jedi were a celibate cult of child abducting people wearing desert robes everywhere. I don’t care if a book corroborates it. 

Again, really looking like you haven't read any of this stuff in order to comment on it. The original trilogy itself refers to Force sensitivity as relative from person to person (e.g. ""strong"" with someone). Finding in-universe ways to measure that is logical extrapolation and not contradictory in the slightest, barring your obstinate headcanon.

&gt; Strawman argument. This is passive lying. Has nothing to do with “nice places.” They’re standing around in a green soundstage with a bunch of cartoony “nice places” added in post.
&gt;Also this is a stupid argument. Having ANY “actors walking on treadmills in a PS1 environment” shots makes a movie trash. It doesn’t make it better that it briefly jumps to a jarringly-different location shoot in the desert after 30 minutes of monks standing around in a half-tendered cartoon setting. That destroys continuity and flow. 

Maybe I gave your argument more credit than it deserved. I thought you were actually complaining about the world building, but you just don't like that they shot it with CGI? Why do you care about the fiction at all? Why not just watch a documentary on practical effects? These things exist to serve the fiction, not the other way around.

&gt; Yeah it went from being “American graffiti in space” with a bunch of spoiled high school kids looking for jobs in ANH, to an Arab bug slave market / death race hub.

Not sure if you've noticed, but for a sample size of one, we've proven that a single planet can have ""American graffiti"" and Arab slave markets/death race hubs. Mos Eisley was obviously not the only city on the planet.

&gt; Anakin impossibly skydiving into the exact hovercar he was looking for without stress and Obi-Wan insanely diving out of a window to ride a droid kind of ruined the location though. 

Most of the PT's action sequences were over the top like that. The second half of the Ani/Obi duel in ROTS was probably the worst. The setpieces were still good though.

&gt; Yeah then it was just LAVA PLANET and RANDOM INDUSTRIAL ASSEMBLY LINE and shit. It was still all entirely digital nonsense. The practical production was terrible.

Star Wars has had a thing for mono-environmental planets ever since the first one. ""Lava planet"" is honestly less ridiculous than a planet that's entirely forested.

&gt; Luke was ruined but that was all fucking Rian’s fault. TFA did a nice comfy layup and TLJ fucking spiked it away.

My running theory is that Rian just hates JJ for some reason that we aren't privy to. I can't imagine jacking up a handoff that hard even if you're too drunk to drive the entire time.

&gt; No you can see things as the the whole gestalt and then analyze the parts individually. Saying “the Star Wars prequels are good movies because of a Cartoon Network show” isn’t valid film criticism. You can say you enjoyed the corporatization of the franchise and consuming the supplemental product, but that has nothing to do with determining if a movie was well produced and a creative vision was well-executed.
&gt; Like is Transformers Revenge of the Fallen a good movie because I had an Optimus prime toy as a kid?

If the content spawned by a franchise's initial seed is good, then the original content is improved for its sake. Had Star Wars ceased immediately after production of the first film in 1977, it would be nothing today, just another has-been blockbuster referenced on occasion in film schools for special effects. Star Wars lingers because of the fiction, and fictional universes are built, enhanced, and maintained through multimedia. It's usually corporatized and money-grubbing because writers, programmers, modelers, and concept artists have to eat and pay rent, and George would have been an idiot not to profit off his baby.

Also, don't mistake me for saying that the prequels can't be criticized because the spinoffs are good. My initial argument was only that the quality of their sandbox for such spinoffs made them better than the *sequels*, which is a pretty damn low bar. There's a lot of missteps to poke at in the prequels (and RotJ too) but I always look at it as a total package, because at the end of a decade or two I've spent *orders of magnitude* more time interacting with novels, comics, television shows, and video games spun off the films than I have watching the films themselves.",True,False,False,,,0,1588386528,,False,0,{},fp890fm,False,t3_gbkgp9,False,True,t1_fp80e4l,/r/OTMemes/comments/gbkgp9/the_prequels_are_still_some_of_the_worst_big/fp890fm/,False,,1594801710,3,True,False,OTMemes,t5_3itr1,r/OTMemes,public,,0,[],

Twitter said that this access could also be used by approved applicants working on crisis management, emergency response or communication within communities, as well as those developing machine learning and data tools to help the scientific community understand COVID-19.
Social media platforms have both introduced new policies to curb COVID-19 misinformation and warned that there may be errors due to their reliance on more automated moderation systems during the pandemic. Researchers studying the platforms have argued that the companies must collect data about this period.
European Commissioner Vera Jourova called Twitter’s move “a good step in the right direction.”
“Our cooperation and regular contacts with online platforms to fight disinformation are bearing fruit. I have constantly underlined the importance for researchers to have better access to useful non-personal data and tools,” she said.
Last week, 75 groups and individuals, including digital rights and free speech organizations, wrote an open letter to social media platforms asking them to preserve and publish their content moderation data.
However, Twitter said that once tweets were taken down, they would have to be removed from this COVID-19 data set.
Currently, Twitter’s free, public API access offers a small percentage of its full stream of tweets, although the company does provide greater levels of access to paying clients.
Twitter said it had never offered a full stream on a particular topic before, and that it represented tens of thousands of dollars per month in data.
Researchers will be able to access tweets created from the moment they connect to the data set, but it will not provide historical data.
In the blog post, it said that any developer or researcher with an approved Twitter developer account can apply for access to the COVID-19 stream endpoint, but they must meet a set of requirements, including that the use case supports “the public good.”
Applicants will also have to explain how they will protect the privacy and safety of people represented in the data.

Felix was wearing a military uniform this time, with three stars on his shoulder. Although Ora had been made aware of his identity much earlier, but compared to when he was dressed in a western suit and leather shoes, Ora seemed to be looking at a different person this time. They sat down on the balcony facing the sea -- by now the sun had already set over the city behind the villa, and before them was the hazy Atlantic Ocean with its shadowy waves.!&lt;

&gt;!Felix said, ""Doctor, you must have brought me the figure I wanted. Oh, no need to tell me right away -- I know it's an astronomical figure for you, but if all goes well, you will have no problem getting it. However, before that, we must speak frankly, absolutely frankly -- it will do you and my side a lot of good.""!&lt;

&gt;!""I've always been very frank with you, but that is not how you've been with me; presently, I know virtually nothing about that side of you."" Ora said.!&lt;

&gt;!""You'll know soon enough - but first I must ask you an extremely blunt question, as this is a matter of great importance, so please understand. My question is: How do you really feel about this country?""!&lt;

&gt;!Ora said mildly, ""General, I'm not interested in politics. But even in the United States, at MIT, politics was also problematic for me. When I was studying for my doctorate, the President of the Institute was James. D. Wiesner^9 -- you probably know him, he was President Kennedy's Science Advisor. Under his influence, MIT became heavily involved in military research; but at the same time, the Institute's School of Architecture and Planning was the kind of mainstream institution that aligned with the far left. This made the political situation within the Institute extremely complicated. Speaking for myself, it was impossible that Boston's inherent racial tensions with being 23% black would not affect MIT; and as a black immigrant who was scaling to such heights, not in the MIT football team, but in the field of academia instead -- there were naturally some very unsettling things....""!&lt;

&gt;!""Doctor -- I'm referring to this country, not its politics.""!&lt;

&gt;!Ora got up and leaned over the railings on the balcony as he watched the colors of the night falling over the sea, ""General, I can tell the difference between the two. Unlike ordinary immigrants, my father and I first went to Europe and -- having no money for plane tickets -- got ourselves on board a freighter over there, before making it to shore in the New York harbor. I remember it was late at night, and we had taken a ferry to the Statue of Liberty after disembarking, when I read the sonnet by Emma Lazarus at the base of Lady Liberty over and over again:""!&lt;

&gt;!""Give me your tired, your poor,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!""!&lt;

&gt;!""I saw night-time Manhattan far off in the distance, and it was like the cross-section of a large gem glowing brilliantly in the colors of the night. You might know how we -- us poor people coming out of that poor continent -- felt at that time; I had tears rolling down my face by then.... And it turned out that I wasn't wrong about this country -- despite some misfortunes here and there, and even some shadiness; but as a self-made person determined to do all that I can, I still broke through the glass ceilings of American society one after another, and proved my own worth. I love the United States, even if I can't quite sacrifice myself without any hesitation like Nathan Hale did -- but, General, if this country needs me to do certain things, I'll definitely do all I can.""!&lt;

&gt;!Felix said: ""Well, Doctor, this country's really got a problem. Presently, the United States is facing the worst crisis in military strength since the Vietnam War -- from the boot camp in South Carolina to our naval base on Guam -- and there is every indication that the military strength of each service is now dangerously low. There are too few volunteers enlisting, and too many people leaving the military, so it is extremely difficult for the services to meet their enlistment targets every year. The reason for this is that economic prosperity has presented more opportunities to earn even more money than a life of military service; while the values and outlook of the 'internet generation' has also been in a constant state of flux.""!&lt;

&gt;!""Conventional mobilization cannot turn around this decline in prospective service members for the United States. The services must recruit more and more people who are not interested in the military, who will then be leaving the services at a higher rate. As a result, the work load of career soldiers just gets heavier and heavier, which reminds us of the staffing shortages in the American military right after the end of the Vietnam War.""!&lt;

&gt;!""At the same time, looking at political trends both internationally and domestically, it is not possible for us to retain the existing numbers in our military. The whole world is presently going through a troop reduction phase together -- but if we reduce our numbers along with the others, things would get very scary. No other country on this planet has our kind of needs: the capability to wage two high-intensity wars, at the same time and in the farthest places away from home soil. So if we go with the flow, we'll lose everything. And looking back at domestic politics, the major interest groups were all too eager to get a piece of the peace dividends after the Cold War; but it's been nearly a decade now, and they've been disappointed with what they've gotten, so the voices clamoring for disarmament are ringing out again.""!&lt;

&gt;!""Therefore, the Pentagon must make preparations for this: to carry out current military missions, or even more numerous and difficult ones, with a much smaller military in the 21st century; that is to say, we need soldiers of much higher caliber than what we have now.""!&lt;

&gt;!""From the American youths of today, we can recruit soldiers who act like scientists, soldiers who act like engineers, soldiers who act like artists -- but soldiers who act like soldiers are getting harder to find, even though these kinds of people are the soul of the military. The process of modernization is, in a sense, the process of feminization in the mental disposition of humanity; for the young people of modern America, it is getting harder and harder to endure the physical and mental stresses of war -- even if it's just sitting down in front of a computer to control a cruise missile, these stresses still exist. To make matters worse, pacifism is getting more popular in the country now, and has become a kind of public nuisance; this makes it harder than it was during the Vietnam War for American soldiers to cope with enemy casualties as well as their own -- the composure required of a superior soldier in the face of a blood bath, has been deemed by the public and the media to be a kind of perversion. While our enemies, because most of them are still stuck in less developed societies, would have soldiers who are superior in their mental caliber than our own.""!&lt;

&gt;!""Some accuse the American military of deeper and deeper leanings towards technological zealotry, but I personally see nothing wrong with technological zealotry -- technological superiority is still what the United States can rely on for an absolute advantage, so the problem for us is that our zealotry for it now is neither deep enough nor broad enough; if technology can provide with us aircraft carriers, cruise missiles and stealth bombers, then why can't it provide us with superior soldiers? Doctor, I think I've made my intentions very clear.""!&lt;

&gt;!Ora nodded as he mused, then said, ""Before this, what were some of the things that you've been doing?""!&lt;

I’ve only just began seriously looking this last week. I’m looking at schools outside of the United States and Asia (where myself and my wife are from, respectively.) I suppose like most educators, I have the dream of a PhD in one of the high education ranking countries in Europe.

&gt; Do you want a R1 equivalent research level only or are you more flexible?

This is the sort of question I would love some assistance from people further along than me with. Maybe I don’t recognize how important that is for my career but **my immediate reaction is to say I’m more flexible.** I, generally, like to research odd smaller issues and interesting “edge case” things and I’m not sure that is suited to an R1 type institution. 

Examples might be: researching if the percentage of class room environment utilization between learner inquiry based zones (reading corners, learning or hands on stations, etc) versus instructor focused spaces (teacher’s workspace, personal student desk space, shelving, etc) impacts learner perception of challenge/comfort in their studies.

Or maybe, a small research project with 500 students to see if their perception of their own competence and their instructors competence in a subject changes based on whether the instructor used certain titles and speech patterns with the students.

&gt; Do you want to be in STEM (science technology engineering math) for your phd major or stick to education programs only?

My understanding is I would need to be in an education program to do the research I would like to do, but I wouldn’t mind a STEM program at all. My understanding is that because neither my undergrad or masters are in the sciences, I wouldn’t be granted entry into a STEM PhD program, so education is my best chance going forward. 

Right now, I am thinking I want to research the further development of STEM curricula using different pedagogical approaches and subject matters that aren’t yet readily accessible to the majority of young learners (wearable computing, solar energy systems, Aquaponics, basic electronics, algebra/geometry in nature, etc.)

Ele foi eleito porque conseguiu chamar pra si a fama do plano real. Não fosse isso, é provável que o candidato à presidência pelo PSDB fosse Mário Covas.

Só depois que ele perdeu popularidade que a ideia de privatização ficou radioativa por uns anos, quase como investimento público hoje depois do PAC. A economia parecia muito bem entre 1996 e 1997.

Logo no começo do mandato em 99, tiveram mudanças drásticas que afetaram bem a economia e 99 e 2000 foram anos ruins. 2001 foi mais ou menos por causa da crise do apagão. Isso tudo foi minando a popularidade dele. Um cara que foi eleito em primeiro turno estava tão mal visto no fim do governo que até o [candidato do partido dele falava em mudança em 2002](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfHCuFNwOk). [Outro vídeo do Serra falando em mudança](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbfucjlOHeY). 2002 foi um ano bom, mas a galera teve um medinho do Lula e então ficou no mais ou menos.

A coisa boa é que ele usou da falta de popularidade pra limpar a casa com um ajuste fiscal. O Lula continuou com essa política nos primeiros anos de mandato.

EDIT2: Ah sim. O trato com Congresso ersa bem mais fácil do que foi pra governos posteriores. O Congresso era bem menos diluído e ele basicamente contava com o apoio de 5 partidos pra ter maioria simples no Congresso.

NuCanon seems to have rolled with this, based on what I've seen in the new episode of Clone Wars.

No, they do not all use terrorism (attacks on civilians). But my point was that even the self-declared socialists and Marxists of the Palestinian nationalist movement support the creation of an ethno-state with some religious laws. My point is they aren't really Marxists.

&gt; if they were going to ethnically cleanse the Germans from Prussia they should have set up a Jewish majority state there as an autonomous region of Poland

There were a variety of Jewish communities in Europe after WWII that wanted to leave Europe, for obvious regions. Jerusalem was picked because A) It already had a large population of Middle Eastern Jewish people, B) It was the center of Jewish religious and cultural life, C) It was sparsely populated with no national identity.

So European Jews joined their Middle Eastern Jewish cousins. Today, Israel is half Middle Eastern, not European origin. ""Go back to Poland"" doesn't work when the majority of people are third generation, many much further back, and many fled or were expelled from Arab lands they can't return to.
