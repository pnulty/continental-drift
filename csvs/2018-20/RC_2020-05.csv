Development:
It can be a big thing in early-mid game for extra income or manpower plus getting Institutions outside of Europe. If you haven’t yet, try playing in Africa, Asia or the Middle-East to see how that is.

Vassals:
It is definitely a good thing to have them, I actually prefer Marches because I’m not so good at wars and combat. Also definitely check the wiki to see what their national ideas are to see what they can be best used for (aka as a March to boost your armies or as a Vassal to help with income).

&gt; ROME. Italy on Thursday reported 285 new fatalities from the novel coronavirus, bringing the total to 27,967, with the largest daily drop in active cases since the beginning of the outbreak.

&gt; Italy&amp;#039;s government commissioner for the pandemic said on Wednesday that the country was now prepared for a second wave of infections &amp;quot;Even bigger than the first,&amp;quot; in case the partial reopening of activities led to a new peak.

&gt; Both the Northern League and far-right Brothers of Italy accused the government of having imposed heavy emergency measures, which limited Italians&amp;#039; constitutional rights, without involving parliament.

Because every deal is unique. Here, the UK can say the ECJ doesn't apply in other deals and yet, it doesn't matter. Each side comes with its conditions and expectations.

&gt;In what way does interjecting with our legal system give them a better trade deal?  

When the UK and the EU will have a conflict in trade matters, simply. It's better to have a judicial body supposed to apply your rules rather than the other one, I suppose. No it isn't fair, it's business.

Don't use ""treating like an enemy"", it is playing the victim card. There is no ""enemy"" here.  You don't do trade at all with an enemy, you set a blockade and you starve him. We're far from it.

You probably never noticed before how the EU is ruthless in negotiations because UK was on the good end of the stick until now. Look at how the EU forced the west african countries to align their agriculture to not compete with EUropean own production while still leaving themselves open to EUropean produce. And they are not enemies either.

And no, the UK won't get any favour. No, the UK won't get a preferential treatment in the name of the 'good old days'. The EU has interests like the UK has. But now, they are no longer aligned, coordinated or the same.

&gt;Is it your general position that countries that are involved in trading  blocs should be able to do whatever they want to countries who aren't?

The EU isn't able to do whatever they want. The UK can perfectly refuse to sign any deal. And that's all.

&gt;So I guess you'd have no problem if the UK violated the sovereignty of a  poorer country, 'cos that's just life right?

That had nothing to do with a pandemic and everything to do with a housing market at all time highs and a stock market at all time highs since the 2008 crisis. That crisis was a housing market crisis (created by the financial industry and) ""solved"" by printing a bunch of money and making it easy for people to spend it in the housing a stock market the last 10 years.

While we're on the subject, when has anyone ever offered people money to take their oil because nobody can afford to store it? That hasn't happened in my lifetime.

That is a lot of jobs lost already with consumption so low and Saudi's flooding the market. 

When has unemployment globally gone higher than the great depression in a period of 2 months?  

When have businesses been told to stay closed so that people social distance globally? And consumption on products that aren't food shelter and clothing went down 80%? 

Remind me when THAT happened and then explain why housing isn't correcting in any way and people on wall street are selling a story that a pandemic is ""priced in"" already lol 

We haven't even touched on the trade war that started in 2019 between China and America. Remember they devalued their currency and Trump started barking on twitter how the Fed needed to weaken the US dollar. European banks had negative interest rates last year BEFORE a pandemic. 

We still haven't seen the first bank go bankrupt internationally but all of them are over leveraged and wont want to lend in an environment like this. Then you have central banks questioning each others currency value during this.... 

I mean, what the hell gives an investor confidence in a market like this? How is this even being a ""doomer"" when this IS actually unprecedented?

I think we can and it is desirable. Often the reason deer overpopulates is because their natural predators were killed - because these also attacked our livestock. They are part of a balanced eco-system. In Yellowstone, 1995, wolfes were reintroduced. Deer started to avoid certain areas of the park, their absence meant plants could grow again. Aspen and willow trees began to flourish. With the trees, came berries and bugs. Thanks to that various birds returned to the park. With the trees, the beaver, previously extinct in the park, was also back. Their dams attracted otters, muskrats and various reptiles. The wolves also killed coyotes, so the mice and rabbit population grew. This attracted foxes, weasels, badgers and hawks.

I think it is more desirable, and beneficial overall to have than say, shaved areas of cattle-farms.  
Animal agriculture is also the main driver for species extinction. And as you said, birthrates decline as living standards increase. In Europe for example birth-rates are even below sustainability level. I don't think that people being vegan or not is a main deciding factor in that regard and I do think we have to take into account our current situation. Feeding all humans with grass fed beef isn't sustainable or feasible.

But, I agree, we could say, population size is the main driver, poor sustainability choices do only increase or multiply that issue. (We could argue in an ideal sustainable case: What was better, more vegan humans, or fewer ones but eating meat)  
Lets for our moral matters, though, take a scenario where none of this would be an issue. So little humans that it would be sustainable either way:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;(Trait:) animals are domesticated

If this is the dividing factor for you that makes it ok, to kill and eat animals but not humans, then you would be against killing and eating wild animals (similar to how you think eating humans is wrong). Do you think it would be immoral to kill and eat wild animals?

Let me apply this ""domestication""-factor to a human scenario. (I know I'm stretching the term or definition here a bit, but I think when we discuss exactly that issue between the distinctions of humans and animals than that is reasoned to do). And apply the exact same steps and actions taken in domestication of an animal, to a human.

Say hypothetically, the romans, 2000 years ago, with their boats came across an island with a wild native tribe of humans in Asia or wherever. They took them captive and started to farm and eat them and breed them to alter their genetics so they grow faster (they become much fatter), and also much more docile and accustomed to be farmed. They have changed significantly from their original form, and could not survive outside of that farming situation in a wild scenario.

Would you say, it was justified for us today to kill and eat those humans, based on the fact, that they went through the steps of a domestication process?

Because the main issue, for me with your argument is, that every justification you give, would fall flat, when you apply it in the same way to humans. Let me show what I mean:

How do these justifications ring true to you, in that new situation?

\- we can condemn it, but it already happened.

\- It would be ""odd"" to call them captive, they evolved to be in that situation.

\- They require to be domesticated at this point, because they have evolved to exist in captivity.

\- These humans have much higher success rates in captivity, they would go extinct without us continue farming and eating them (on a larger scale).

\- It's more cruel to destroy them all, than to kill a percentage of them each year. Their collapse would go against the will of the whole tribe.

\- Each killed provides value to sustain the tribe. It is symbiotic and beneficial for them to keep eating them.

My question to you: What do you think would be the appropriate thing to do with these humans, if we found ourselves today in such a situation?

That would be my main question.  
And maybe *how much* worse are you morally allowed to treat these humans, after they went through a process of steps of domestication in the past, than other humans who didn't?

Few more things:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;such a collapse would go against the he will of the whole species.  
an animal has no concept of ""killed early"".

That seems a bit picky to me. I think if it had a concept of global species sustainability or success, then surely also of its own lifespan. I'd argue it does actually have the latter, otherwise it wouldn't run away when it perceives a threat that would end its life earlier.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Duration of life seems irrelevant to me if it is mostly happy.

This alone would not be a justification either I'd say. With the same reasoning I could argue, when I raise kids, and they are happy. It is ok for me to then kill an eat them. I mean total happiness is positive and then potentially infinite if we continue doing so, right?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;what trait do domesticated animals lack that makes it ok to want to make them extinct, but non-domesticated animals have that makes it not ok to make them extinct

I don't think they differ in a specific trait. And exactly therefore also be equal in the regard of freedom and autonomy. I think we should evaluate them and give their freedom a fair shot. Most cattle for example could live in the wild.  
But say other ones: like chickens that grow so fast, their legs break.  
I don't think it is justification enough to continue breeding them into existence en masse for the next thousands or millions of years or how long. They suffer tremendously and are entirely our creation. Veganism will be a gradual process, we will not have to free billions of them from one day to another.  
Maybe the right and fair thing to do would be to assist such a breed to regain its ability to survive in the wild, or protect them, since it was our choice to take away these capabilities.

I figured you believed that. That's why I quoted above

&gt; Mussolini declared in 1934 that ""[t]hree-fourths of Italian economy, industrial and agricultural, is in the hands of the state

An economy that is only 1/4 privately owned is not capitalism. Or in any case, there is only a small capitalist sector, usually the most productive BTW, 

&gt; Again state-control doesn't automatically make it socialist.

It depends which of the thousand definitions of socialism you are using. By my definition that's pretty much what it means. Capitalism is where private companies compete for the business of consumers. If the government runs a factory and enforces a monopoly for that factory, then it is not capitalism. 

Capitalism can include worker owned businesses. If all the workers of a company own the company privately and compete against other private companies, to me that's capitalism.

State capitalism is an oxymoron.  If the business is not privately owned and doesn't compete with other private businesses, then it is socialism. Whether the government exploits it's workers is immaterial. Exploitation exists in any system. 

&gt; ""Fascist governments in both Italy and Germany privatized state-owned enterprises at certain times.

But they nationalized more than they privatized and aimed to increase government control of business even more. The Fascist government controlled 3/4 of the economy. That didn't happen by privatizing everything.

&gt; Fascism has corporatism, which is regarded as a mixture of Communism and Capitalism, but in practice it is much more capitalist. As Fascist governments favored wealthy businessmen and suppressed worker rights.

Not really.

&gt; #Fascist Manifesto of 1919

&gt; In 1919, Alceste De Ambris and Futurist movement leader Filippo Tommaso Marinetti created The Manifesto of the Italian Fasci of Combat (the Fascist Manifesto).[120] The Manifesto was presented on 6 June 1919 in the Fascist newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia. **The Manifesto supported the creation of universal suffrage for both men and women** (the latter being realized only partly in late 1925, with all opposition parties banned or disbanded);[121] proportional representation on a regional basis; government representation through a corporatist system of ""National Councils"" of experts, selected from professionals and tradespeople, elected to represent and hold legislative power over their respective areas, including labour, industry, transportation, public health, communications, etc.; and the abolition of the Italian Senate.[122] **The Manifesto supported the creation of an eight-hour work day for all workers, a minimum wage, worker representation in industrial management, equal confidence in labour unions as in industrial executives and public servants, reorganization of the transportation sector, revision of the draft law on invalidity insurance, reduction of the retirement age from 65 to 55, a strong progressive tax on capital, confiscation of the property of religious institutions and abolishment of bishoprics, and revision of military contracts to allow the government to seize 85% of profits**.

    Buffeted by criticism of his policy on Europe, battered by rebellion in the ranks over his bill to legalize same-sex marriage and wounded by the perception that he is supercilious, contemptuous and out of touch with mainstream Conservatism, Mr. Cameron earlier this week took the highly unusual step of sending a mass e-mail (or, as he called it, “a personal note”) to his party’s grass-roots members.

Even if your complete goal is rehabilitation, you are still ""harming"" them. You are removing their freedom, their ability to make choices and go where they please. So would you argue that you can't force rehabilitation? I'm sorry, but harming someone isn't a binary thing, it's very much a spectrum. And unless you are completely against any enforcement of the law, then you are for ""harming"". Do you believe all enforcement of law should be abolished? Or should we let murders continue murdering because if we tried to stop them we would be imposing on their right to do what they please, and make us just as bad as they are? Now I will agree that excessive harming is immoral. But I consider excessive harming as inflicting pain for the purpose of inflicting pain, with no real benefit. Revenge essentially. But keep in mind that prison can still be a deterrent without prisoners having to fear for their lives and well-being. They can be moderately punished and still be treated with human dignity. I'm not trying to say that what is going on in prisons right now is A-okay.

But shouldn't society have the right to defend itself? Should individuals have the right to defend themselves? Is is wrong to kill someone who is currently trying to kill you? They are still people, after all. I don't think it is, and I don't think it's different at a societal level. Society has the right to do what it has to in order to protect itself.

&gt; The US Dollar (USD) recorded broad losses during yesterday’s trading session as demand for the safe-haven currency was stifled by improving market sentiment.

&gt; This comes as investors grow increasingly optimistic at the prospect of more countries reopening their economies.

&gt; The US Dollar will face more headwinds in today’s session with the publication of the latest US GDP figures, which are expected to show domestic growth contracted by a sizable 4% in the first quarter.

&gt; Also influencing USD exchange rates will be the Federal Reserve’s latest rate decision. No policy changes are expected this month, but will the Fed’s forward guidance hint that the bank could implement additional stimulus measures in the future?

https://www.poundsterlinglive.com/usd/13205-u-s-dollar-attempts-to-stabilise-after-fed-pledges-whatever-it-takes-and-ahead-of-ecb

&gt; The Dollar was attempting to stabilise on Thursday after suffering broad losses overnight in response to the latest Federal Reserve (Fed) policy statement and clinical trials results for Gilead Sciences' remdisivir, although its trajectory into month-end could now be at the discretion of the European Central Bank (ECB)

&gt; Currency markets were choppy Thursday, leading the Dollar Index to alternate between fractional gains and losses following the latest Fed update and ahead of an ECB policy announcement that's key to where both the Euro-to-Dollar rate and Dollar Index end the month. The ICE Dollar Index has risen 0.35% for April and the Euro-to-Dollar rate has fallen -1.33% and was trading 0.05% higher around 1.0882 Thursday. The Pound-Dollar rate was down -0.09% at 1.2458.

&gt; This is after the Federal Reserve made no changes to its multiple programmes that offer monetary support to U.S. companies and households on Wednesday but told markets in an unambiguous manner that it stands ready to provide whatever financing is necessary to backstop the economy and set it on the road to recovery once the pandemic is brought under control.

More than 430 million enterprises in hard-hit sectors such as retail and manufacturing risk ""serious disruption"", the UN agency added.
The findings appear in the ILO Monitor third edition: COVID-19 and the world of work, released Wednesday.
Globally, there are some 3.3 billion workers. Two billion have jobs in the informal economy, the most vulnerable workers in the labour market. The agency said 1.6 billion in the informal economy ""have suffered massive damage to their capacity to earn a living"" as a result of the economic meltdown triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Due to lockdowns or because they work in hard-hit sectors, these workers globally have seen a 60 per cent drop in income during the first month of the crisis, according to ILO estimates.
This translates into a more than 80 per cent decline in Africa and the Americas, 70 per cent in Europe and Central Asia, and 21.6 per cent in Asia and the Pacific, the ILO said.
ILO Director General Guy Ryder said as the pandemic and the jobs crisis evolve, the need to protect the world's most vulnerable workers becomes even more urgent.
""For millions of workers, no income means no food, no security and no future. Millions of businesses around the world are barely breathing. They have no savings or access to credit,"" he said. ""These are the real faces of the world of work. If we don't help them now, they will simply perish.""
The UN agency estimated that compared to the pre-crisis levels, there will be a 10.5 per cent deterioration in working hours during the second quarter (Q2) of the year, equivalent to 305 million full-time jobs. Previous projections had put the figure at 6.7 per cent, or 195 million full-time workers.
The situation has worsened for all major regions, again compared to pre-crisis levels. Q2 estimates suggest a 12.4 per cent loss of working hours in the Americas, and 11.8 per cent for Europe and Central Asia. All other regions are above 9.5 per cent.
The ILO added that the proportion of workers living in countries where workplace closures have been recommended, or required, has decreased from 81 per cent to 68 per cent over the past two weeks.
While this is largely due to changes in China, measures have been stepped up elsewhere. At the same time, 436 million enterprises operating in wholesale and retail, manufacturing, accommodation, and other economic sectors that have been hardest hit, face ""high risks of seriousruption"".
The ILO called for ""urgent, targeted and flexible measures"" to support both workers and business, particularly smaller enterprises and those in the informal economy.
""Measures for economic reactivation should follow a job-rich approach, backed by stronger employment policies and institutions, better-resourced and comprehensive social protection systems. International coordination on stimulus packages and debt relief measures will also be critical to making recovery effective and sustainable. International labour standards, which already enjoy tripartite consensus, can provide a framework,"" it said.
The ILO also stressed that international coordination on stimulus packages and debt relief measures will be critical to making recovery effective and sustainable.

The problem in linguistics and finding one language that all languages came out of is that we can re-construct the languages all the modern languages came out of up to a certain point. The only problem is we hit this wall around 5000ish years back where we can't figure out how proto Indo-European connects with ancient Chinese, Japanese, or any other language family. All attempts at re-constructing a global origin language have been rejected by linguistics as a whole. You are right to point out that if we could truly re-construct a proto-world language that all modern languages naturally descended from, it would disprove the Tower of Babel, but we can't, and this fits with the Tower of Babel story. This inability to re-construct an origin language gets even stranger when you realize that there is one and only one exception to the 5000 year rule. The Afro-Asiatic language family. We can trace back every language family to give or take 5000 years back, but we can re-construct proto Afro-Asiatic to give or take 9000 years (these are estimate numbers, I don't care about the value, just the proportions between them). Why can we re-construct one and only one language family to be significantly older than all the rest? It fits with the Tower of Babel story. We have all people come to the Tower of Babel and they all have one language, and then God miraculously causes different people to speak languages with no natural relation. He then takes one group of people and determines that he isn't going to confuse their language, but he is going to let that group of people speak the original language. All language families can be re-constructed to a language spoken at the tower of Babel, only one language family can be re-constructed further back. This is the correlation I am seeing that is enough to convince me that it is true, including the historical records that speak of it's existence.  There is one more important thing about which language family was spared. Afro-Asiatic is the language family that includes languages like Omotic, Arabic, and Hebrew. Focus on Hebrew. Every other culture has ludicrous stories when they talk about anything relating to an event the Bible talks about,.you almost get the sense that large portions of their earliest myths not only experienced the normal processes of legendarization, but that parts of them also got lost in translation. Only the family Hebrew is a part of was spared, which means that the Hebrew people had the ability to tell the stories of the Flood and before in the language it was originally told in, and if not in the language it was originally told, they were able to change the way they told the story as the language slowly changed alongside it so that nothing important was lost in translation. This is why the Biblical story makes more sense then other flood myths, why it is more logical, why it is clearer, and it is because of the tower of Babel.

So with the flood, you are going to have to deal with my Biblical research, because the geaneology from Heber to Abraham in the Masoretic text is wrong (represented by the KJV). Josephus disagrees and the Septuagint disagrees and I also heard the Samaritan pentatuch disagrees but I haven't read that one. Basically, the Masoretic text removed some 600 years from the geaneologies of Shems sons to make Shem look like Melchizedek to disprove Hebrews, and that places the flood 600 years earlier than you probably thought, so you have nothing left but a whole litany of civilizations born after the Biblical flood and a whole bunch of flood myths. BTW, I am using Josephus, the Septuagint, and the Samaritan Pentatuch to say that the original autographs of Genesis was different from the MT. As I said, I believe what Moses wrote was innerrant, not the King James Version.

But other then that they are looting things as hell, I keep reading stories in the local news all the time about how corrupt they are.

And now he literally overruled the parliament, so he is a de facto dictator, but the EU doesnt care how he violated ""liberal democracy"" as long as their profits are rolling I guess.

&gt; Now I can imagine these parties may have questionable attitudes towards capitalism, but I'm certain they are not supporters of communism in the slightest. 

Okay fair enough, they have obviously lost their class consciousness and have not much knowledge of Marxism, so they have no idea. And besides it's not like socialist countries put a lot of effort into educating people on politics, so that was one of their biggest faults. Now today, if every form of media is capitalist owned, which it is, and you basically have a population that is frustrated, but doesnt know what to do, of course they will support the first populist demagogue that will come their way. What can you do it people are stupid.

&gt; The fact is, no matter what your own opinion on things, that multiple countries overthrew their communist leaders so that not one communist regime survived.

Actually that is not true, only a few countries had large participation, especially Poland. In other places people literally just watched it from their TV how their government was changed, they had no say in it (not that they had a lot of say in the socialist system, a great mistake of not holding on to mass line, but the bastard revisionists were to blame). I would not call that a revolt when you watch on your TV how socialism is switched back to capitalism.

&gt; but it's clear that these current states are no where near the level of widespread dissatisfaction that arose during the communist era.

I would not be so sure about it, but the western media has a massive bias of not covering any type of dissent against it, not just that international news wont make it, but the press here is also owned by big billionaires who will definitely not talk anything about it, since that would literally delegitimize their little project that they have been having here. A lot of people are dissatisfied, in fact if you were to do a ""happiness index"" as some countries do, it would certainly be at a 3 out of 10 for most people, and not necessarily the poverty, but just the blatant disregard for human life and corruption in general.

\&gt;No that is more than ""cultural"". We were only talking about cultural autonomy, not about regionalization or secession.

I was referring to strasserists and third positionists i've encountered, they believe in full self-determination, like native americans getting their own countries and whites going back to europe.

\&gt;You are the liberal here, giving them full secessionist rights is counter-revolutionary, because they are actively trying to sabotage the centrally planned economy and anti-socially isolate themselves instead of participating in the shared economy.

Imagine being so much of a liberal you think anything that isnt multiculturalism is bad.

With that said, i'm not exactly for full secessionist policies like strasserists although I get where they are coming from. It totally depends on the context, like i said before i admire what the EZLN dudes do, they have autonomous regions that work with each other and trade but they are governed by various people's councils who meet at congress sessions, everyone more or less under a left umbrella ideology. So in my ideal national communist society there would be something like communes composed of various people from tribal and rural backgrounds, where workers' councils may or may not be ethnicity/race-based, everyone as one homogeneous unite, acting as free-associating producers but with the same ideology. This way national identity is preserved while being internationalist.

\&gt;TIL that subordinating every nation on earth under a common socialist united nations is = to imperialism. // Imperialism is when capitalists unilaterally colonize nations, not when nations collectively impose a binding law on everyone.

Setting aside i didnt say you wanted to be a direct imperialist like liberals, according to lenin's theory on imperialism, if those socialist nations were dealing with the exportation of kinds of capital, that would be imperialist. Imperialism isnt always about colonization, we are in a post-colonial world kind of. This is why some marxists see PRC as imperialist.

\&gt;We are anti-war, we can't use the tools of capitalists, plus it's the nuclear age. Direct warfare has been proven to not work right after the USSR-Polish war.

Soviet-afghan war was 30 years into the nuclear age and they ""invaded"" to help support the communist government who literally begged for their assistance

\&gt;I have been looking around, and it looks like my desk lamp is ""made in China"", but also my mug from which I am drinking my tea now, my TV, my Laptop, the mattress in my bed, and probably 90% of my house utilities are Chinese origin. So what does this tell you about the materialist composition of modern capitalism is a socialist country is literally keeping modern capitalism on life support and has the power to cut the cord at any moment?

Still doesnt mean that PRC is forcing us to be communist. Besides, PRC's biggest trading partner is US with EU is a close second. If PRC cut off the cord, she would probably die since the US would tell EU to cut the cord too. Oddly enough US and PRC owe each other the same amount of debt, so anyway.

\&gt;Fuck off idiot, it's not as indifferent when you have to live under it. It's the material conditions that fucked things up here, and by stealing our laborers more, it won't make it better. We need our economy back.

As much as I want to cuss at you, itd only de-evolve this convo. So you're a cotton-headed ninny-muggin.

Brain drain from 3rd world countries would also be good in your model, those smart people will get jobs easily and immersed in 1st world liberal culture faster than a non-skilled person, since big cities with good jobs are usually progressive. Likewise destabilizing of 3rd world countries just means mature capitalism could hopefully be exported to them in the form of aid.

After seeing the response to the attempted sale of one of these yesterday, and the fact that the last guy decided not to sell, I thought I would put mine up here. I was planning to sell in the next couple weeks, but the immediate interest has motivated me to move a bit faster. I do love this watch, but I have a Nomos Tangente which has similar aesthetics, and gets loads more wrist time; I have far too many watches ATM, and am trying to whittle the collection down a bit.

For sale is a Hamilton Khaki Navy Pioneer, ref. H771553, still with box and papers. This is the 43mm standard seconds (auto) model.

This watch was purchased new in 2017, and has been well taken care of (spending most of its time in a watch case) since. It is in excellent shape, with only a very few small hairline scratches on the case (you have to look very hard, from very close up, to see them). In all, this has been a well loved, and well maintained, watch for the whole of its life.

I believe the wiring should be OK from my limited understanding. It is not possible to plug straight into the wall as I don't live in the UK :).

I made a simple plug adapter by changing the plug on a UK power strip. I snipped off the UK plug and replaced it with an EU plug. I used Wago connectors to temporarily connect the EU plug to the UK power strip. The power strip, cables and Wagos are rated for many more amps than the blender uses.

I don't think this should void the warranty in any way, and that is why I converted the power strip rather than the blender cord. I believe it would be the same as a UK chef bringing this blender to the continent and plugging it into an EU socket with a well rated plug adapter.

The mains lead appears to be in new condition without kinks or twists.

Yes, the blender is double insulated. That is rather scary that the metal housing could be live! I will be very careful with my further testing.

I will do further testing today on the electrical circuits in my kitchen to confirm that they are good. I am a lousy electrician but I have a nice multimeter and YouTube.

I am praying that I can send it back. The warranty expired a few months ago and I didn't send it back because of Corona lock-down. Hopefully Nisbets UK or Dynamic of France will take pity on me because of the situation. Fingers crossed!

US: **5.9%**

https://covid19info.live/

The US has more deaths per million people because the US was vastly more exposed to the disease due to the US being a gigantic hub of international travel and a destination or return destination.

**1 million** people flew directly from Wuhan to the US after the outbreak was underway there. The west coast of the US was inundated with infected people from China, and the east coast of the US was inundated with infected people from Europe. And this was happening while China and the WHO were still saying that the disease wasn't communicable human-to-human.

Also, to pretend that socialized health care in other countries is contributing to lower death rates than the US is just flat out factually inaccurate, both the premise and the conclusion.

Completely accent free? That is never possible if you don't live in a Spanish speaking country. But this is not necessary. 

Most Europeans speak English. Especially the younger generations or people in smaller countries. All of them have an accent. You hear one word from a Dutchy and you know they're Dutch. Doesn't matter how good they speak English.

In my opinion, the ""you can't get fluent if you're older"" excuse is an excuse made by people who either don't want to put in the work or feel bad that they are not fluent.

It's true that your brain changes with age. Children are very good at ""learning languages"" because they start from a blank canvas. But that doesn't mean that this is the best approach. It takes children a decade to learn one language well. You can be much quicker if you put in the time because you can actually get instructions (from a book or tutor. A tutor isn't necessary). Your accent won't be perfect but you'll probably be able to talk about politics when a child can barely explain how their toys work apart from ""It makes beep beep when you hit that thing"".

I've met and know so many people that learnt a language later in life. My Aunt learnt Spanish by living on Ibiza in her 30s. She's still fluent getting close to 70. My other aunt learnt Spanish for fun (Arabic native speaker, fluent in French, can communicate in German) and she's in her 50s. My grandma grew up in WW2. You didn't learn English in WW2 in Germany. She's still reading books in English to keep her mind busy and active. My mother (62) got her ancient school English out when visiting my aunt and her friends and then later told me ""oh this is kinda cool I just speak and English comes out"". 

You're always able to learn a language. Always. You just need to put in the time. Always (not just as an adult).

The difference, in my opinion, is how the people approach language. There are the people that want to learn one language on their own that buy text book after text book always chasing the next big app and then there are people who already learnt a second language to fluency outside of a school setting (maybe because they visited another country for a long time) and now go for the second one. They know that what got them good in their other second language wasn't studying but exposure.

None of the people I work with were particularly good in English. But because we have such an international team they had to get better. Being forced to talk and read English all day at work made them better and they all acknowledge that. Not a text book.

I recommend the following: get the basics down. Duolingo (don't need to finish it), text book, whatever. Get familiar with the grammar and how the language works. Then get a graded reader. I have this one (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HWZX3JB/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i2). It has okay reviews.

Then just start reading. Once you're done with that, get your favorite book in Spanish. Or any book that seems interesting. Just start reading. Read a sentence / page / chapter / whatever without looking things up and then go back and look up words you don't know. Write them in the book. If the first page if all black because of your notes after you're done, you're doing a very good job.

Then maybe start a show in Spanish (with Spanish subs maybe). Maybe look for YouTubers. 

If you're already in your 30s you probably have a career and / or family. You probably don't move to Spain or Latin America for a while. You are probably happy that you can maintain your social life after work as it is already so finding new friends that speak Spanish might be tough.

The goal is to make your free time as Spanish as possible. But you don't want to spend all your free time stduying. So get to a point where you can enjoy what you would do anyway in your free time and just do it in Spanish. And you don't actually need to be very good at Spanish for this.

Just graduated last semester, live in Lafayette - just airing this as something of concern, again - for those living here currently, as in now - today - over the coming few weeks. 

Over the next few weeks Lafayette will see a rise in cases and deaths - there already 110 confirmed cases here in Lafayette, and two confirmed deaths (the number of suspected deaths is much higher - death from pneumonia and other respiratory illnesses has been unusually high in countries around the world over the past few months (literally all around the world, even in war-torn Yemen and anarchic Somalia there has been widespread death due to unexplained respiratory illness. 

In Tajikistan, a country long plagued by war and civil strife, the first case - or 16 cases - today. Previously, an unexplained massive rise in deaths and especially severe illness had been deemed by the government to be 'the result of a particularly bad case of the pneumonia this season' - literally denying covid19 could be a cause. 

Now only North Korea, Turkmenistan (which may be even more totalitarian and cult-of-personality driven than the DPRK, but has tons of oil, natural gas, uranium and other highly desired natural resources) and the tiny African state of Lesotho have yet to officially announce cases. 

This is global. It affects some demographics more than others. Those in more polluted areas, or who have lived in such areas long-term in the past. Anyone with lung issues, including asthma. Anyone with heart conditions including hypertension (so, basically half the people my age). Auto-immune issues. Cancer. Seizures. And so on... is more likely to suffer tremendous illness or death. Older people, too. Those people are people's parents and grandparents. My parents, just at 60, are both in extreme danger as a result of different underlying conditions and are in full lockdown. It could easily prove fatal. And there are a hell of a lot of people who can say that. If you don't want to play Russian Roulette with your odds on this virus; your family members' odds; your spouse or significant others odds; etc. of survival then that is on you. But recognize how, statistically, at least one of them is going to die, and three are going to end up hospitalized at some point between now and this time next year. The world is not only facing economic collapse, it is facing psychological collapse. The shear amount of grief - do you even understand it? Do you understand the fear of being in your 30s and suddenly realizing both your parents could die - only to have that fear further encouraged by having a sibling and nieces contract it (and with my 1 year old nieces developing 104 degree temperatures). It is a matter of time before virtually everyone can tell a story like that, if they themselves didn't get sick and were lucky enough to either not contract it or prove asymptomatic. 

So Russian Roulette with the lives of everyone you interact with in the coming few weeks (or whatever the timeline is for your particular locale), or behaving rationally and being a responsible citizen like the rest of us and actually stay home. I mean, hell - is that actually asking that much? Stay home.

You aren't being drafted into working in a hospital or field hospital.

You aren't burying the dead. 

Or storing them in freezer trucks, as is happening in NYC. And similar things in LA.

Other generations got drafted. Or were left homeless by the tens of millions. Or fought in any number of conflicts.

You? 

Just, stay home.

Yes - you get to stay home, sit on the internet, watch Netflix, shop on Amazon, go outside and take a stroll (not allowed in many countries right now, both democratic and authoritarian). You can play a damn videogame, eat food, stay up all night. You can 'work from home' for a business never set up to - so you get paid to watch Netflix and play videogames and so on. 

Yes, more needs to be done to deal with the current economic problems that are immediate (including a guaranteed income for a set number of months; rent relief; utility relief; further support for small businesses to start back up later in the form of grants, not loans, and a national approach to rebuilding international and domestic supply chains. 

But you won't have a hand in any of that anyway. 

And in the meantime, you aren't being sent to trenches off in Europe, or in an Atlanta hospital. 

81% of Americans and 99% of global citizens just want you to stay the hell at home.

I always struggled with early feedback, since quite often it points to aspects that I know will be different in the end anyways.

I can see the benefit however, since the earlier you go and change something, the easier it’s going to be.

To understand why the market is rallying, you have to answer why the market rallies when it does. Why doesn't it rally all the time when that'd mean people can make money easy? 

####Why doesn't the market rally all the time? 

One word. RISK. 

Markets are future looking and rally when the risk that was priced in into current prices drop - either due to business(es) booming beyond expectations - showing that previous expectations are no longer valid, and that they (businesses) will make more money than previously imagined. Another reason is governmental actions that reduce risk - like lowering interest rates which reduce risk for companies by making cheaper debt available, and more money being open to be lent. 

Of course I don't need to suggest that these perceptions of reduced risk (via government actions or more commonly via expectations of better business) need not always be accurate. It helps to remember the frenzy around the dot com bubble where stocks companies that weren't making money were bid to the moon - a rally, yes, but a bubble. 

The difference between a bubble/hype and a regular rally is sustainability. If the new knowledge results in a sustainable increase in income for the companies, then the rally is far more likely to be stable. If it's not, then sooner or later the earnings are going to spill out the story, and that's the end of that. If at any point there is irrational exuberance in the market, then there opens up an avenue to make money by going against the markets and waiting for the markets to correct. The market is kind of self correcting in that fashion. The shift is fast - much like a level balance that's heavy and tilted to one side for long and shifts rapidly to the other as the weight on the opposite end increases. And near the balance point where the forces are nearly equal, you see that the slightest shifts in weight cause great movements - the volatility is high. 

####Why is there risk in the markets? 

One reason there is risk in the markets is because the companies need money to service their expenses and payroll and they can do so via income from selling goods and services or by raising debt.

Well, with fed announcing their intent to support the markets any way possible, an interesting phenomenon occurs.  Since fed had promised to take action including buying junk bonds - a lot of companies who a few months ago had to worry about raising debt, now have the fed as a willing buyer their debt/bond issues. It means that it has become less risky to invest in these companies now, than it was in January because they are more assured of safety now, than before. Compared to sometime ago, say early January, the markets are now actually less risky. And naturally money is flowing into these stocks. 

A second effect is via the Congress's pushing of bills to put money directly in the hands of the people - via direct cheques as well as payroll support for small businesses via loans that are explicitly forgivable. This means that there is money in the accounts of common people - even though they don't have a job or are not actively working on a job - and the belief is that they are going to spend this money, and so the outlook for a lot of companies is not too bad because consumers are continuing to spend - and their spending is someone's income. In particular look at Netflix, Amazon etc. 

A third effect is due to the status of the dollar as a reserve currency, as a safe haven in turbulent times. This has caused a flow of money from various locations into the dollar, and a strengthening dollar let's the fed print more dollars, because there is strong demand for it.

A fourth effect is due to the historic low yields on bonds. Europe has plenty of negative yielding papers and even the US has low interest rates. All the money that wants to find yield has few places to go with such low yields everywhere - so a good fraction of that ends up in the stock market. This, tbh was happening even before the crash. The valuation of the equity markets depends on the availability other lower risk avenues of returns. In the absence of which the equity valuations soar. 

#### Long term effects

If you buy a Mavic pro or pro 2 it should work but the input lag is very high and you can’t fly FPV properly, only in an open area/sky.

The tiny whoop is a good compromise, later you can build one by yourself or buy a rtf FPV model. You can repair them if something messed up by crashing it.

If you fly real FPV (race or freestyle) get the right gear and don’t buy a camera drone.

The two-storey building was completed in 1961 during the city's boom of ""desert modernism"" – a mid-20th century style that adapted European modernist design principles to suit the desert valley's dry and arid climate.

The sculptural white colonnade along the building's front is both decorative and bolsters the structure in the event earthquakes. At the base, the columns join to form scooped bottoms and resemble the distinctive facade of Alvorada Palace that Brazilian that modernist Oscar Niemeyer completed in 1958. Although Williams reportedly denies basing his design on the Niemeyer residence, the slim pool with fountains at the front of the bank is also similar to the mass of water surrounding the presidential residence in Brasilia.

Thank you for your kind words too!

I'm born and raised in Greece and honestly you should visit Greece once global lockdown is done but you shouldn't only visit tourist attractions there is more to Greece than that. And you should follow your gut feeling indeed!

I'm sorry that your mother is horrible too! My mum has been physically and mostly emotionally abusive towards me all my life, only in recent years has she tried to be a kinder which scares me even more because she acts as if the previous 18 years of my life hasn't happened and she actually tries to gaslight me into thinking that my point of view of events is wrong or over dramatic...which angers me. Unfortunately, she has said far worse things to me other than blaming me for grandpa's death, especially a sentence I will never forget or forgive is her telling me I'm an emotionless bitch that deserves what I got and I will get. This sentence was referred to me being a victim of bullying at school and in general in life. She has told me that I am ugly and no man would love me because of it. And so on... 

I keep my distance from my mum especially emotional distance from all my family, I don't show my true emotions and during this quarantine I realized that I had put up a facade with them for so long that they thought I was a complete different person than who I am truly and they were shocked when I would let a little bit of my true self show on purpose instead of by accident.

I have been feeling strong connection to Ireland my whole life, Celtic folk music helps me calm down from anxiety attacks. I also love 1920s Jazz and Swing, oh I can be listening to that music all day! Then I love instrumental music too! It's so weird in the eyes of my family since I was raised in a Rock/Heavy Metal and Greek folk music listeners' household. 

I remember watching Irish folk dancers on TV and feeling so at home! I remember that I got so excited that according to dad as a toddler I used to go up to the TV screen and kiss it or just touching it and saying ""I miss you"".

I don't know if that has ever happened to you but  Greece has various dialects other than modern Greek and Ancient Greek and it depends on the region you are in. I was mostly raised surrounded by Pontic and Russian-Pontic dialects and as a child I used to mix dialects with modern Greek without noticing which got me bullied at school when I was living in Lesvos where they have their own dialects too and most times I couldn't gety point across so I had to unlearn the dialect although I can still recall words and phrases I won't be able to keep up a conversation solely on dialect though. 

My grandpa was from Eastern Thracy and immigranted to Greece in 1922 when the Turkish and Greek population exchange happened. Eastern Thracy is now part of European Turkey and Bulgaria and they have various dialects which up to the age of 15 years old I was completely oblivious to, mum never spoke dialect and my grandma she didn't want to hear it because she missed her husband, my aunt never bothered to learn and I never met any of grandpa's family who knew Eastern Thracian dialect and was cognitive enough to teach me, I met his two sisters before they died and they didn't speak dialect or when they did was because they were lost in their own head and it was mumbled and jumbled up that it made no sense. So, I'm 18 years old helpingy dad load our broken oven to the elevator to throw it away when I hit the sides of the elevator and I leave a mark on it. I subconsciously cursed not in modern Greek but in Eastern Thracian - Old Bulgarian dialect which caused my dad to look at me shocked and mum to yell at me asking me where I heard it and I didn't know at all. It just came to me and to this day I don't know how. Mum told me that she had heard grandpa say it twice in his life and she didn't know what it meant either. The word I had said was ""Sitma"" yet I can't find anywhere what it means. I asked my Greek Literature high school teacher that has also family from Eastern Thracy if she knew what it meant and according to her ""Sitma"" is a paraphrase for ""Damn it"" and ""Gamoto"" I never listened to that word before!

As for seeing my situation as a gift, well I'm working on it. I still try to get used to it. I spent so much time confused about it and searching for answers that now I'm absorbing information and processing.

*Nol Voorn, now 99 years old, suddenly took the boat to Argentina, a well-known refuge for Nazis, two years after the Second World War. Why ?, her grandson Maarten van Gestel wonders.*  
   
Nol Voorn (26) looks around and sees only water. It is 1947, two years earlier she celebrated in a marquee in Haarlem that the Netherlands had been liberated and danced the foxtrot with friends and her husband. Now she is on the deck of a freighter. Today, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow: every day only water.   


The crossing from Amsterdam to Buenos Aires takes four weeks.  She doesn't know anyone on the ship. Her husband Cor (30) made the trip a few months earlier, he has now found work as a beer mug maker in Buenos Aires. In the Netherlands, hard work is being done on reconstruction. Food is still on the receipt, Nol's peers getting used to the new post-war world. She herself is on her way to Argentina and has no plans to return soon.    


When I tell parties at 2020 that my grandmother Nol (now 99) emigrated to Argentina after the war, I always see the same look in the eyes of my interlocutors. ""Wow, why did she go to Argentina?"" They ask. ""Was she an NSB member?"" I hear them think about it.    


Thousands of Nazis are known to have fled to South America after the capitulation, where they were received with open arms by questionable regimes and thus evaded criminal trial and sentence in mainland Europe.    


That is the history that lives on in our pop culture: in the film Long Shot, which partly takes place in Buenos Aires, the (Jewish) actor Seth Rogen joked last year: ""It is cool to be in Argentina. I think the guys who killed my grandparents are still hiding somewhere here. "" The comedy is otherwise not credible: the plot revolves around a journalist who becomes the speechwriter of his former babysitter, now the upcoming President of the United States, and oh yes, they also fall in love. But the idea that post-war emigrants in Brazil or Argentina or Paraguay were runaway Nazis does indeed contain some truth.  


**Dark atmosphere**

My grandmother was not an NSB member. She left the Netherlands because she was ""afraid of a new war"", I say at those parties, as she always told me. Because she was done with the gray atmosphere here, the shattered cities and the winter of hunger behind her. With her 500 thousand other Dutch people, went to South America, to Canada, to Australia: it was the biggest wave of emigration our country has ever known.

But still, I usually think after those parties, I never really understood why my grandmother turned her life back so rigorously after the liberation in Haarlem. Certainly not after interviewing forty 80-, 90- and 100-year-olds for this My Liberation series for de Volkskrant.

Most of them said they were celebrating. They were relieved from Limburg to Groningen, finally feeling free and looking forward to a brighter future. My grandmother had a great life in the Netherlands: a mother, a husband, nice neighbors, friends, the beach where she went every weekend before the war, a rowing association with which she rowed on the Amstel in 1938.  
   
My grandmother was not eager to travel: as a girl she did not dream of distant countries, even though her father was a captain in the Dutch East Indies. Even after she returned to the Netherlands with my 2-year-old mother from Buenos Aires in the 1960s, she rarely went on vacation.

Couple that with an increase in cost of living. Those ridiculous health insurance costs etc and you would have to seriously value travel to go somewhere outside North or Central America. 

My issue isn't Americans not traveling. I get it...plus I acknowledge many still do. It's that many who have never left the US in any meaningful way will speak with authority about how awful other countries are. 

I'm by no means rich, but I've been lucky enough to travel to around 60 different countries. I've spent a total of probably around 1 year in the US. I came to the same conclusion many other Europeans come to. It's an incredible country...to visit. I wouldn't want to live there.

Travel is expensive...but that's not the reason people don't travel. To get a job that gives you the compensation and time to travel, it's likely you will have needed to spend years at college gathering incredibly debt. The cost of education in the US is silly. All roads lead to a low end entry level job to start paying off that debt before it balloons with interest. 

At this point, people are paying for their own housing, healthcare, car etc. Even when they get that second better paying job...the money gets swallowed up. To spend thousands on a 2 week vacation abroad seems a silly financial decision, so most don't. 

Europeans absolutely have geography on their side in this regard, but they also mostly have much lower University fees, universal healthcare and more vacation time. Many can survive quite well without owning a car because of better transportation systems. 

Also, European society does not see foreign travel as some frivolous expense like I've noticed they do in the US. It's absolutely valued. When I spent all my savings and left my job to go to Australia when I was 22, my parents were so happy I didn't spend it on something stupid. It basically kick started my adult life and now I live in a different country far from home and I've seen things I never thought I would. I came from a poor background.

We live in a smallish city somewhat separated from the largest ones - it's a good size for a balance of essential services vs space/quiet, and if how our city and its population has dealt with the virus is anything to go by, it's an indication that we're in a good place.  We keep enough essentials around to get by for a couple of weeks, and beyond that....well, if two weeks isn't enough, I don't think there's a single thing we could buy, or own, that would likely protect us from whatever the fuck is going on.   That may be näive, or it may be just as you say, a mindset.  But in this case ours is cultivated by how the society around us feels/looks and reacts when times are tougher.  Trust in each other - and in society around us - is a big part of that, I'm sure. (Perhaps it is the biggest when it comes to how people from different countries think about adversity; we see for sure differences in how people react to COVID for example, where conspiracies or cries of injustice flourish in some places, but not elsewhere.)  People can and do change in times of crisis, I'm aware of that as well.  But in any case, we believe the safest place we can be right now is right where we are, in a smallish, generally stoic and practical community of families, old folks and students who know each other already.

That's not to say we don't pay attention to what's happening out there - we do, and back in January/February when we started to get word about the virus, and found out the Chinese were actually buying masks from OUR online shops, that prompted us to be sure we were ready with extra supplies, and a box of five reusable/washable FFP3 masks ""in case"" we had to go out.

&gt; Al Jazeera&amp;#039;s Investigative Unit has obtained exclusive video revealing a huge backlog of goods at China&amp;#039;s biggest export hub that is slowing the supply of medical equipment urgently needed to protect hundreds of thousands of health workers as they fight the global coronavirus pandemic.

&gt; China produces nearly half the world&amp;#039;s supply of protective medical equipment with America and Europe two of its biggest customers.

&gt; The huge backlog of exports at China&amp;#039;s busiest airport is the result of a &amp;quot;Perfect storm&amp;quot; of events that have choked the freight system; tougher Chinese export controls in response to international pressure to weed out sub-standard equipment, huge demand for PPE and a severe shortage of cargo planes.

The United States was originally supposed to function as a bunch of small independent states that shared some resources and services. Think about it like Europe today. You have a bunch of countries that have all tied their economy and laws together, but they’re still their own countries. 

This is what the original vision for the US was. It’s not quite that way today. But you have some leftover legal structure from that time. 

If you take a single state and think of it like a whole country, then the function of a county emerges as a province.  In fact, most states’ governmental structures mirror those of the federal government. Most. There are exceptions. For instance, Louisiana doesn’t have counties. They use “parishes” instead, though they fill the same legal function. 

Just like there’s a President for the country, there’s a President for the state, though they’re called a governor. But the job is essentially the same. Each state has its on version of congress with a state senate and a state house. There are state police, and state agencies. 

Let’s take Tennessee for example. It’s the easy one because that’s where I live. I live in Blount county, in Maryville, which is a suburb of Knoxville. 

If Tennessee was its own country, I would live in Blount province, in the town of Maryville. However, since Maryville and Knoxville are so geographically close together, they are sometimes conflated even though they’re completely distinct.

If I’m talking to somebody local, and they ask where I’m from, I tell them Maryville.  If I’m talking to somebody from, say, California, I tell them Knoxville. Even though Maryville and Knoxville are legally and geographically distinct, they’re close enough and Knoxville is sufficiently larger that people are more likely to know where that is than my little town. 

It can also go smaller than that. Some very large cities are divided even further into legal entities called boroughs or possibly a different word depending on the city. 

New York City, for example, has five boroughs - Harlem, Queens, Brooklyn, Bronx, and Manhattan. 

Each legal division has the authority to write laws for the divisions contained within. 

So the federal government (the United Ststes) can pass laws that affect states, the state government (Tennessee) can pass laws that affect counties, the county government (Blount) can pass laws that affect cities (Maryville) and city government passes laws that affect subdivisons or boroughs of that city (Sandy Springs).

&gt; RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO - Imported by the Brazilian elite vacationing in Europe, the new coronavirus is now ravaging the country&amp;#039;s poor, ripping through tightly-packed neighborhoods where the disease is harder to control.

&gt; Residents in Brasilandia, a poor district at the north end of Sao Paulo with the highest coronavirus death toll in the city, told Reuters that bars were still crowded and open-air dance parties attracted thousands of revelers on the weekends.

&gt; William de Oliveira, a community leader in Rio&amp;#039;s poor hillside neighborhood of Rocinha, can rattle off the names of several friends killed by the virus.

If you don’t require really high-mem or more than 4 cores, these are awesome. You can put 3 of their NUCs in a 1U if you want, or just do one or two depending on needs/budget. The i3 and i5 also offer a custom PSU that does 802.3at PoE, but you may not need that. Without PoE you can go with the i7, apparently i7 sucks too much power to run stable over PoE

If having a proper rackmount is more attractive than using a NUC on a shelf and you don’t have really serious workloads requiring tons of RAM and/or cores, this is the way to go. A friend got one with 3, he PoEs them and loves them- this was about 6 months ago

You pay a bit of a premium since they’re custom built, down to the mounting kit and the actual NUC chassis itself. If you have 802.3af/at at your switch and want to PoE, the PSU is also custom as well obviously. One port does PoE+1Gig, the other is just 1Gig

I saw his three x i5 1U installed- it looks really nice, he says it’s completely stable on PoE and the active cooling on them was quieter than his switch (a 24 or 48 port EdgeSwitch 250w or 500w, not sure which)

They may even have an i9 model, but I don’t see it on the site. They do have an i7 + 8GB + 250GB SSD in the matrix on the site, which seems top of the line, but he thinks they’ll build to spec if you ask. He said they prototyped/tested an i7 on PoE for him but couldn’t get it stable, so they may work with you on special requirements. I assume the RAM could go higher, I know NUCs generally support larger DIMMs

There may be tariff/duty costs if you live outside the EU, where they ship from. He’s within EU so it didn’t cost anything extra to ship

Fiscal paradises exist but they are more and more regulated. Now I do not know how things are in the USA; but I know the EU directives about it, and the more you track money, the more you can tax transfers to and from tax shelters.

Also fiscal paradises awesome concept for the super rich, except if they actually move their money there , and there is a lot of control of international transfers, they are stuck trusting that fiscal paradise to be preventing people from embezzling it or losing it. A fiscal paradise might offer ""hey we take car eof your money, and we charge 100 dollars a year for that and no tax"" which is fiscally advantageous for sure, but what recourse do you have if you do it and bank goes bankrupt (Iceland...) or there is embezzlement or something? It is a balance between risk and no taxation, the places with robust economies who can bail out banks and investment, independent justice systems, non corrupt police to  dissuade embezzlment usually can sell themselves a lot better than by promising no taxes.

&gt;And places badly affected by it will set place tax exempts and securities for these riches, so they feel safe dropping their millions/billions there, while the country benefits from it.

in the current climate, do you think a billionaire really is going to feel secure dropping their billions (in which currency) in an unstable country?

A 25 year old, Palestinian from Israel, goes to America and now Democracy doesn't work? Why did he come to the US then and take a slot at Harvard?

He went to Harvard but doesn't understand the [wisdom of the crowd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd)?

&gt;The **wisdom of the crowd** is the collective opinion of a group of individuals rather than that of a single expert. This process, while not new to the [Information Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age), has been pushed into the mainstream spotlight by social information sites such as [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia), [Yahoo! Answers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Answers), [Quora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quora), [Stack Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Exchange) and other web resources that rely on collective human knowledge. An explanation for this phenomenon is that there is idiosyncratic noise associated with each individual judgment, and taking the average over a large number of responses will go some way toward canceling the effect of this noise.

By design democracy expects not everyone to be a good actor, it is able to deal with that and the only system that can. Democracy requires an informed electorate, but not always or everyone.

Just like a comment thread on reddit, eventually experts emerge. Democracy matches how people transfer information from one generation to the next. The larger the crowd, the more correct the information can be. Democracy allows the people with information to get it out, and spread it. The truth and good information survive longer than the fake news even if the fake news gets a head start.  Without Democracy people that bring those truths and information are sidelined or give up in authoritarian systems.

Yes propaganda is a problem, and fraud, but they will always exist and democracy is the only one that can deal with that, otherwise you have top down authoritarianism eventually. The only system with good noise cancelling for bad ideas and promotion of good ideas, *eventually*, is democracy.

Democracy shows the good and bad and everything in between, it has a pressure release valve.  Authoritarianism, which he says China is doing the best, hides and shrouds the bad and is usually much worse than the presented propaganda (see North Korea). Authoritarianism has no pressure release valve and eventually explodes when the authoritarians have to keep a shell game going to hold on to their ideology.  Democracy can discard bad quicker, though sometimes it moves frustratingly slow, it still moves forward.  Authoritarianism is locked until it explodes.

Wisdom of the crowd also says that

&gt;""A large group's aggregated answers to questions involving quantity estimation, general world knowledge, and spatial reasoning has generally been found to be as good as, but often superior to, the answer given by any of the individuals within the group.""

Authoritarianism, or non western liberalized democracies, eventually leads to dictatorship see in China (Xi president [for life now as of 03/11/2018](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-43361276)) and Russia (Putin president [for life as of 03/11/2020](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51815667)).

I strongly, strongly recommend you do NOT go with this breeder.  Responsible breeders do not allow buyers to pick their own puppies and CERTAINLY not at 3 days old.  Puppies get matched with homes based on personality and needs and that can only be done at 6-8 weeks old.  Allowing you to pick the puppy based on nothing but color and gender shows that the breeder does not care whether or not you're a good match.  They only care about making the sale, and they are willing to do anything to close the deal (oh, you want the tail? Sure, whatever, as long as you pay me!)

A lot of backyard breeders and puppy mills have discovered that there is a market for Aussies with tails, and so they are capitalizing on it.  Responsible breeders make the decision across the board - either all of the pups are docked or none of them are.

I say all this as someone who has a tailed Aussie from a good breeder.  I spent a long, long time doing research.  We drove 7 hours to get our pup, and many of our littermates drove in from further or flew in.  I will tell you now that there are only about 5 good breeders in the US that do not dock.  The majority of responsible breeders of tailed Aussies in the US are breeding them for sport (agility), and so these dogs are a high octane and very intense.  Not recommended for the average owner.

If not docking is a huge thing for you, then I highly suggest importing an Aussie from Canada or Europe where docking is banned.  Otherwise, I'd suggest looking at similar, adjacent breeds such as the English Shepherd.

+ Capitalism has brought more people out of poverty than Socialism. LISA, Europe, India(emerging) and China ( through

Capitalist investment).

The things you think of as Socialist are not. Free healthcare, workers rights, pensions, unions and environmentalism.

None of those things are Socialist. They were all invented by Capitalists.

And Socialism has been responsible for at least 70 million deaths and counting and an economic system that keeps

people working class. The queues you see now for food and goods were the everyday norm in Soviet Union.

Also the current Chinese Socialist government is responsible for death camps, organ harvesting and covering up

Coronavirus which has killed 200,000 and counting as well as propping up the North Korean regime responsible for

killing millions.

Capitalism has brought a few individuals mass wealth and exploited billions of others. Socialism didn't create slave

labor or sweat shops, pure capitalism.

Workers rights, unions, and socialized healthcare are indeed the fruits of socialism and supporters of the working

man. Corporations and billionaires didn't start unions, the working class did, the ideas for which came from socialists

of the 19th and 20th century. If you think capitalism created socilized medicine, then why isn't the biggest capitalist

nation around doing it? Because capitalists never give anyone anything unless there is a profit to be made, you pulled

that out of your ass. Pensions obly need to exist in a system controlled by fancy pieces of paper and greed.

Environmentalism while not exclusively a socialist idea, is an inherently anti capitalist idea. Last i checked, not a single

corporation or billionaire has made any attempt to rememdy the situation they themselves created.

Socialism is not responsible for any deaths because socialism has never been achieved and the only solid attempt at it

was Lenninist Russia, which i might add was pro LGBT, pro gender equality, and anti racism by about 1921;

unfortunately, Lennin died and Stalin ruined all the progress that had been made. You say lines for food were the

norm in Soviet Russia, I take that as Russia actually socialized food and made sure people had food. Here in America

we just let the poor starve.

Lastly, the current Chinese Government isn't socialist, their ""official"" designation is communist. If we are going to be

pedantic about titles and labels, then by your assertion, North Korea is a democratic republic, its right there in the

name. Dont be disingenuous, you know full well China operates as a State Capitalist Oligarchy which is not

communism. I suggest you read a book of socialist and communist theory, that way you don't speak from ignorance

next time.

I can also understand why people might disagree with this. From the comments in this thread it seems to me that there are three main arguments that people are making against diversity, which I've listed below. All of them are understandable, but I think they can all be refuted.

1. 'Middle Earth is supposed to be like medieval Europe - to have an ethnic diversity that is unrepresentative of that historical era damages the sense of realism that makes Middle Earth so great.' -- My first problem with this argument is that it is factually inaccurate. While their numbers were lower than they are today, I don't think any historian worth their salt would dispute the fact that people of colour were not an unusual sight in medieval Europe, even in the Northern cultures that inspired Tolkien. The second problem  I have with this argument is to do with the suggestion of realism. I agree that part of what makes Middle Earth the greatest fantasy universe ever devised is its sense of reality and believability. But it's also a fantasy universe! There are elements of it that are nothing like what medieval Europe was really like. The existence of dragons, for example, or dwarves. If these obviously imaginary factors are acceptable deviations from the historical reality of medieval Europe, then why isn't a greater number of people of colour acceptable?
2. 'It goes against the lore.' -- This is probably the most convincing argument, but I think it's also fundamentally flawed. My response to it is that any adaptation of a text into a film is going to make adjustments to it to make it more appropriate for that medium. I don't think it's controversial to suggest that several of PJ's deviations from the original text in the LOTR trilogy made for better movies. Cutting Tom Bombadil out, choosing to tell the story concurrently rather than in the two points of view used in the novels, and moving the Shelob sequence into ROTK rather than TT, all made for a better experience of Tolkien's story and world in cinematic form. Given that any adaptation will involve some changes to the original text, isn't the inclusion of some people of colour a pretty tiny sacrifice to make? Unless you would like to see a literally word-for-word adaptation of Tolkien's material, which might in fact make for quite bad cinema, then I don't see why this kind of modification isn't one of the first amendments you might want to make.
3. 'Elves can't be black because they are somehow ""light"", ""fair"", ""clean"" etc.' -- OK, but unless there is something inherently light, fair and clean about white actors then there shouldn't be a problem with people of colour playing those roles. I don't like to throw around the r-word very often, but this argument is, I think, essentially racist.",True,False,False,,,0,1588345951,,False,0,{},fp64k6c,False,t3_g47nyx,False,True,t3_g47nyx,/r/LOTR_on_Prime/comments/g47nyx/more_diversity_in_lotr_show/fp64k6c/,False,,1594764459,1,True,False,LOTR_on_Prime,t5_wnoj8,r/LOTR_on_Prime,public,,0,[],

I watch duff football every Saturday afternoon so I see no need to bother with more.

I really don't have an SPFL team, my brother lives in Birmingham and has a Villa season ticket, so I've become a keen fan of anyone they're playing against so that I can wind him up. I find that's about as much as I can be bothered keeping up with.

The Soviets were probably going to be the aggressors should a conventional ground war in Europe ever broke out and they designed the tanks that to be committed to the offense. This is also the reason why their tanks are so much lighter than ours. The t80,72 and 90s are all around 50 tons. The Abrams is nearly pushing 70. They were aimed to cross West Germany's bridges without a problem.

The Chieftans engine was simply underpowered and unreliable. It really was as simple as that. Underpowered would've have been fine, but unreliable is simply a no go for ANY military vehicle. I'm going to paste an answer I found on Quora about the Cheiftans engine from a former tanker that actually manned one during the height of the Cold War:

"" I served on Chieftain Mk2 and Mk5 1971 - 1974

The gun was excellent I managed to hit a target (Centurion) with Sabot AP round at 3,000m while on the BATUS ranges in Alberta Canada.

The armor difficult to give an opinion as it was never tested during my time but we were prety confident that it was one of the best available at the time.

The engine was the biggest pile of crap invented by mankind. Apart from taking hours to replace (A Leopard Mk1) could do this in under half an hour. It was very unreliable. I will attempt to explain. The design for the engine was first developed for the Zeppelins in WWI on paper it gave a tremendous power to weight ratio. Now bear with me this is a bit technical. The engine was a 6 cylinder 12 piston vertically opposed two stroke diesel. The engine had no cylinder head (saving weight) instead it had two crankshafts permanently joined by a series of gears. One at the top and one at the bottom. Each crankshaft was connected to six pistons that came together at the centre of the cylinder to squeeze the air fuel mixture. Like all two strokes it has intake and exhaust ports but relied on the supercharger to blow out the exhaust gases and force in the air. Still with me? Difficult to explain without diagrams.

To add insult to injury the engine was designed by Rolls Royce but the MOD gave the contract to build them to British Leyland. During the seventies British Leyland were probably the worst possible choice as their engineering left a lot to be desired. That is putting it mildly.

A common fault would be that the (wet) liners (cylinders) of the engine would overheat and crack at the exhaust/inlet ports. Coolant would enter the cylinders resulting in huge clouds of steam exiting the exhaust. Much to the delight of the breakdown crews.""

Yeah, if they ONLY looked good vs Afreeca, you would have a point. But they played well against more than just Afreeca. 

Anyway, if you're going to say that Afreeca collapsed, then what do you call EDG in 2016? What do you call G2 in 2016? Surely, those teams must have been utterly shattered. You can't possibly believe that they played up to snuff?

Actually, you can't possibly believe it, because it is empirically not true that EDG played like the LPL champions that had dominated their region goin 18-0 in matches and 38-7 in games. Why? Because Pawn was playing for them in groups. Scout was the person that played most their matches in LPL. Scout played 90% of the game, a full 40/45 games. Pawn played against some bottom teams, so it really didn't matter too much. 

And was Pawn the same caliber of player as Scout? Not at the time. Objectively, he was not. Pawn was amongst the bottom of mid laners while only playing against the bottom of mid laners. He only ever played against Tockers, Chawy, Westdoor, and Ryu. He never played against Faker, Kuro, Crown, Bjergsen, Perkz, Xiaohu, Scout (impossible), or Jensen. Yet, he still managed to perform like shit: -12.8 CS, -435 Gold, and -597 XP and 475 DPM (13/19 mid laners in DPM). Meanwhile, when Scout played against the likes of Tockers, he destroyed him and carried the game, something Pawn was unable to do and so EDG lost to INTZ. 

Yet, you will still maintain that C9 is the worst major region team to make it to the top 8, even though H2K's road was the easiest we have ever seen.",True,False,False,,,0,1588348067,,False,0,{},fp68oay,False,t3_gb3ppy,False,True,t1_fp5hcgh,/r/leagueoflegends/comments/gb3ppy/the_crack_down_s01e15_overcoming_tilt_how_jankos/fp68oay/,False,,1594766523,0,True,False,leagueoflegends,t5_2rfxx,r/leagueoflegends,public,,0,[],

However, scaling is still effective even if the enemies don't totally outscale you. For example, level 200 enemies are still more difficult than level 40 even if you can kill them. Also, they can just reduce the effectiveness of our scaling damage like how Vauban's shrapnell is not OHK at high levels. But besides that...

Why does a soft cap have to exist, though?

It's reasonable to have soft caps if the missions rely on a key system (e.g. old void) so that players don't damage the economy. But since Warframe doesn't have anything like that now, it doesn't do anything other than forcing high level players to rely on weird strategies like waiting for enemies to ""time out"" in interception missions.

* [Time](https://liquipedia.net/overwatch/Bian_Yutao): He said he was going to learn driving...
* [Huamao](https://liquipedia.net/overwatch/Zhou_Xiaolong): He was fooled.
* Roy: The team is not closing down, they will recruit new members. As for rest of the KR players, some are still interested in new professional opportunities, and the transfer fees are not expensive.
* [Alan](https://liquipedia.net/overwatch/Gai_Yandahan): JJANU is free-agent, though.
* Time: I made some confirmation, they will probably just acquire a team in NAOC.
* Roy: Transfer fees for some players are really low but *(Titans)* still agreed, really ""good value"" *(for other teams).*
* Time: As far as I know, two players has been taken already.
* Roy: Also I heard Titans were in touch with GEN.G, so the new roster may not be full-American/Canadian/European.
* Alan: I can't get it, why did they announce one by one?
* Huamao: Maybe some are taken while others are not.
* Time: Two of them are taken, Ryu is retiring, and the rest will probably continue their career as they did not express the motivation to move to another game. Haskal is already taken.

Stąd wynikają 2 fale zachorowań rocznie zimą na półkuli południowej i północnej (z tym że oczywiście grypa nadal funkcjonuje cały rok wszędzie, mówimy tutaj o zachorowaniach w kontekście całej populacji). 

Na dodatek szczepionki są dość lokalne, tzn. np. szczepionka w tym samym sezonie dla Unii Europejskiej i dla Ameryki Północnej może się nieznacznie różnić pod kątem konkretnych szczepów. Szczepów w liczbie mnogiej, bo są to szczepionki poliwalentne, czyli takie które chronią przed kilkoma szczepami grypy. Najczęściej stosowana jest nadal trójwalentna, rzadziej czterowalentna. Dla sezonu 19/20 w Unii rekomendowane był szczepy A/Brisbane/02/2018,  A/Kansas/14/2017 i B/Colorado/06/2017. W czterowalentnej dodatkowo był albo  B/Yamagata/16/88, albo B/Phuket/3073/2013.

Okej, ale co to jest np. ""B/Phuket/3073/2013"". ""B"" oznacza wirusa grypy typu B, ""Phuket"" to miejsce gdzie dany wirus został wyizolowany (Phuket w Tajlandii), ""3073"" to numer szczepu. Tak, trzy tysiące siedemdziesiąt trzy szczepy... Na koniec masz rok z którego dany wirus pochodzi (2013). W kontekście wirusów typu A masz trochę inny podział na subgrupy. Stąd np. A/Brisbane/02/2018 należy do podtypu H1N1, czyli tego samego do którego zaliczał się wirus 'hiszpanki', czy też 'świńskiej grypy'.

Zmierzam do tego, że mówiąc 'grypa' mówimy o chorobie wywoływanej przez tysiące różnych (chociaż spokrewnionych) wirusów. Koronawirusy nie mutują w ten sam sposób - nadal mamy do czynienia z SARS-CoV-2, oczywiście z regionalnymi wariantami ale nie na tyle istotnymi żeby szukać analogii z grypą. Na dodatek wirus ten doskonale radzi sobie w wyższych temperaturach dlatego nie ma co oczekiwać sezonowości spowodowanej zmianami pór roku.

 'Ta choroba' zakończy się albo gdy ok. 80-85%  populacji ją przebędzie (wersja katastrofalna) albo gdy opracowana zostanie szczepionka. Oczywiście nadal istnieje ryzyko, że np. za 10 lat pojawi się SARS-CoV-3, ale będziemy wychodzili wtedy z zupełnie innego punktu wyjścia. Ba, gdybyśmy  nie porzucili prac nad SARS-CoV-1 prawdopodobnie nie mielibyśmy dzisiaj aż takich problemów zarówno w kontekście szczepionki, jak i leczenia.

* Whilst yes, the American economy grows faster than either all other economies or most, Germany's growth is still nowhere near ""bad"". If economy and growth is all that matters, then it's clear you listen to a lot of right-wing propaganda. (Not saying I support the left. Both sides create a lot of propaganda.) Like I said, plenty of European economies are still going strong and growing. Not as fast as the U.S., but that isn't going to kill our quality of life. We still *are* growing.
* Our standards? Firstly, Europe is an entire continent. Saying Europe's standards is stupid, since some nations like Russia have low standards, meanwhile nations like Switzerland have standards better than the U.S. could ever hope to have. Yes, America has the most freedom of speech in the world, but other than that 75% of the time Europe isn't below American standards.
* We do as good as your poorest states? You really need to get outside of the U.S.A., or just read actually non-American propaganda. Take Norway for example: Way higher salaries/income for the average Norwegian than the average American, way more equality, MUCH higher living standards, far superior social services, way more happy (the claim that Scandinavia isn't as happy as indexes say is just wrong. I've already seen the Janteloven arguments, and I can confirm it's not what people claim), far less corruption, and way more. Don't believe this? If so, you sound like an excessive patriot, aka you deny facts because you can't accept your nation not being #1. And Google it for yourself, because it's a known fact quality of life is, on average, higher in Norway than in the U.S. Yeah, a lot of the generally considered ""best"" European nations are far more expensive than America, but the amount of money you have isn't all that matters in life. Plus, the high income rate makes up for the price of living.
* Switzerland, Austria, all the Nordic nations, Germany, BeNeLux, Ireland, Estonia, etc. are far better in quality of life than Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, New Mexico, etc. Don't believe me? Google the living standards, happiness rates, etc. Yeah, those states do still have pretty fair income rates, in comparison to their European counterparts, but remember that the high inequality of America makes sure a lot of the population don't get anywhere near that income. Also remember money isn't the same as a good life. Life is a lot more than money, but according to you income rates and economic growth is the only way to live the best life.
* Average American doing better than the average European? Well firstly, America isn't the only place where you can thrive as a human. Believe it or not, but at the end of the day you definitely are aware most people in the world live decent lives. Iran is under a ruthless dictatorship and has lots of problems, but the people are still some of the most generous in the world, in general happy, and live normal lives just like everyone else. The Chinese live good lives, the Russians, Turkish, etc. Secondly, Europe has 700-800 million people (can't remember anything close to the exact number). America like what, 329 million? Not a very good comparison. And even if we look at the EU, then saying Americans are better off than Europeans shows your lack of knowledge of countries outside America. Here in Denmark, for example, it's definitely far better than your poorest states. Dare I say your richest states. Because guess what, a huge percentage of Americans can basically be considered definitely poor or essentially poor. Probably around 35-45%. Just look at the inequality rate for yourself. Anyways, why is Denmark better? Well, it's far happier, has a strong income rate, some of the best living standards in the world, the education is better than most nations' (saying better than most because education is generally still very bad in most nations), there's private healthcare and education for anyone who doesn't like the public ones, Denmark is a world leader with rights and freedom, and so many more things. In general, Denmark is actually higher than the U.S. in the vast majority of those categories. Google it.
* At the end of the day, I don't literally mean Europe is doing better than America, since it being better is entirely subjective. Make the average American live in Europe for a year, and they'll probably still prefer America -- which is completely fine. Make the average European live in America for a year, and they'll probably still prefer Europe. It's how it works. People will always prefer their birth nation, and thus Americans aren't ""better off"" than Europeans. That's just retarded. Because they'd prefer whichever they consider themselves from.

But hey, if you want to make shitty arguments to why America is better than Europe, go ahead. We live in a free world. At the end of the day Austria, Switzerland, Ireland, the Nordic countries, and BeNeLux have higher living standards than America, are happier, have more equality, better education, etc. That's a literal fact you can search up for yourself. Yeah, individually America would do a lot better, with states like Pennsylvania, Minnesota, California, etc. probably being around as high on those categories as their European counterparts, but to say the average American has it better than the average European is retarded. If you want to brag about America's GDP, economic growth, and high living standards for some states and the upper classes, then do it. But don't act like you actually know how life in Europe is. You clearly don't.

Lots of good info and links even if you're not London based.  The /r/askuk wiki is also worth checking out, don't bother with the one on /r/unitedkingdom.

For financial stuff such as banking, insurance, loans, getting a car, getting a good mobile phone deal, utilities deals, cheap deals for general stuff, etc etc, refer to the website http://www.moneysavingexpert.com.  If either of your employers offer high street discount schemes use them.  We save 4% week in week out on our groceries by using gift cards that we buy.

For medical, you should by now have registered with a local GP (General Practitioner) close to where you live.  If you have not done so, you will need to to access medical facilities.  Find one at http://www.nhs.uk.  The same website lists dentists but NHS dentists (whilst much cheaper than private) are hard to find.  We do not have the US scheme where you go out and find a specialist doctors e.g. an OB if pregnant; instead it all goes through the GP first.

For emergency services, call 999 (although I hear 911 works too).

For getting around (once the virus dies down in the months to come), you must have noticed the enormous price difference in fuel for the car by now.  Once things get back to normal, the train may appeal for long distance travel.  Booking way the hell in advance (up to 3 months) generates way cheaper fares albeit fixed on a specific service on a use it or lose it basis.  Flexible tickets cost more.  Note that we are much stricter on drink driving than the US, both penalties wise and also culturally.

Budget airlines are a major thing in Europe and don't have Spirit Airline's asshole pricing strategies (if airlines ever get back off the ground again in the coming years once this pandemic calms down).  The major players out of the UK are Easyjet and Ryanair but others exist (for now at least) including Vueling, Wizz and Eurowings.  You can also take trains across Europe (under normal circumstances) - for anything to do with trains refer to the outstanding website http://www.seat61.com.  They are far beyond anything the US has, speeds over 150mph are common with a handful of lines cruising at 200mph.

If you're keen to avoid people when grocery shopping, I can definitely recommend the last 3 hours on Friday evenings for quiet time.

We have 8 bank holidays per year.  Two are in May, the next one is Friday next week (8th).

Fairy Liquid is identical to Dawn, just a different shade and smell.

We shut down totally for Xmas day.  No shops open, restaurants are pre-book only, no fast food outlets open.  Many pubs will be shut, others open just for a few hours in the afternoon.  If you want to eat out on Xmas day somewhere that's got a good reputation, try to book it before October.

After a certain time you will have to exchange your US licence for a UK one.  Consult http://www.gov.uk (which is the general government services portal) for help, or specifically https://www.gov.uk/driving-nongb-licence

EDIT: Thanksgiving is not a thing.  Search around for American expats if you want to make a thing of it.  Halloween is much less of a thing than it is in the US.  We go big for Guy Fawkes day on the 5th November; basically we burn effigies of a 17th century terrorist who tried to blow up parliament but who got snitched on before he could succeed.  Lots of fireworks get let off.  You'll find many organised events.  

If you want to see some crazy festivities in the UK assuming virus rules permit, look up bog snorkelling, glastonbury (which is cancelled for this year by the way, you have to pre-register months ahead and when they release tickets it sells out in about 90 minutes), tar rolling in ottery st mary or cheese rolling at cooper's hill.

She said she was outside the US, and for the price I am guessing Paris, London, or a main commerce city in Europe. In most places, the burden is on the owner of the house since the tenant is assumed as the weakest part. 

In some jurisdictions, you can not just kick out your so out for things unrelated to the tenant-owner relationship, for example.

For example, in some places, if he cheated, she can not kick him out as it is unrelated to the lease, and she will have to wait until the contract expires, he damages the apartment in some way, or he stops paying. In some places, if he had lived there for more than X amount of months, he is entitled an N period to leave. 

For this reason, some lawyers will recommend avoiding creating a tenant-landlord relationship when a relationship exists.

Source: My dad is American, and I pay his rent for valid reasons so. So I have some info to compare. The owner has very little rights other than the lease be paid in full and on time but has a lot of obligations. My mom is European and lives in LATAM (I pay her part of the rent, see below). I am European and have a place like two hours away from Frankfurt (I am the tenant my contract is pretty simple, but man do I have rights) and I own a small place in an area outside Madrid (partly owned, I have tenants I have a lot of weird obligation, for example, kicking someone out for not paying involves the law (municipality and sometimes the police) and takes a long time, with little expectations of me been paid for those months). 

I pay my mother a small rent because I have a room and a lot of my things in her house as she lives close to an airport-hub in the area that I use a lot to move around, and it makes sense for me to use. 

We have a contract, the contact is very straight forward and none-detailed but the law that governs it says things like (paraphrasing): the tenant is under no obligation as to the terms of the lease, but the owner is. Meaning I can walk from the contract whenever I want just losing the deposit.

Before the paranormal researcher organizations of the modern era there was the Cult of the Black Archive, an ancient secret society dedicated to keeping the esoteric forces and eldritch gods that plague our reality firmly hidden and contained. They operated across Europe, Africa, and Asia starting in the Late Bronze Age. They collapsed following an unknown catastrophe in the year 1 CE, eldritch influence is suspected. Very little is actually known about the group, apart from the fact that existed in the first place and that they were founded after stumbling across a library left by 


The setting is heavily populated by all manner of supernatural forces. There’s magic, eldritch deities (both roaming the cosmos and imprisoned on Earth), monsters, spirits, aliens, and pretty much every mythological creature exists in some form or another. Most of human history is pretty similar to our own, and the Cult did not have modern technology or anything even close, they were very much working with whatever tech ancient humanity had on-hand, though they could have some weapons that would seem as advanced for the time (i.e. crossbows rather than just bows and arrows). Also, around the time they were operating, gods were not actively roaming the Earth. The ones imprisoned there *could* have been manipulating humans in subtle ways and creating paranormal items and creatures of their own to influence events to their liking, but the Cult wasn’t annihilated by Cthulhu rising or something.

Perfect time for me from the day we start chatting to the day we marry is something like 6 months, but ofcourse its depends on many things

21yo. 5'11'' (181cm), 125lb (56kg), 6in (15cm). Slim body, long legs, dark brown hair, blue eyes

Look at my sexy pics [**here**](https://imgur.com/a/ETD54qJ)

I consider myself as confident, cute, honest, open and hopefully interesting person

Some of my main hobbies is videogames, playing guitar, surfing web/Youtube, reading, and of-course watching porn😏😁

I speak decent English, have enough practice of real time conversations

I'm ""perverted to the bone"". Slutty, open minded, bisexual, into all aspects of BDSM, have a lot of kinks, fetishes and dirty fantasies😈

I do webcamming (check my profile, can't post here) for more than a year already, i like to do it especially when i get paid lol 😄

My nature is submissive/bottom for a Man, and switch for girls/Tgirls. I'm not interested to dominate my Husband, but if you will really want it, i think you can convince me😏

I want to be a good wife, pleasure my Husband needs, be supportive, loving and caring for him , and yes i can cook, clean and help in house

I fell myself as girl from pretty young age, and at 18yo i fully admit that i need transition, i need to look and live life as sexy girl, but i will keep my girlcook for sure😉

Sadly i'm not on HRT yet, because of my place and situation, but i already do everything i can for my transition, learning feminine voice, makeup, walking on heels, training myself to give good sex, have a long girly hair and always full body shave

I have a desire to be bimboficated, especially in the appearance part, but nothing too much and crazy

Also i would like to become pornactress at home/amateur pornactress that mean i will webcamming, selling videos on sites, having a hot Instagram and etc. - but this is something what i can discuss about with my Husband, if he is don't want it

Conversely, most of the 'high-consuming' developed world has a very small share of total emissions. Around 2% for most European nations, for instance.

https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/each-countrys-share-co2-emissions

Btw, China's emissions for producing products for the west are only 16% of their 30% global total. Or 4.8% of world emissions.

Edit: 

Also, let’s be clear by what is actually meant when we talk about the West’s ‘consumption’.

A homeless person in the US has double the carbon footprint of the global average, simply because of the services they use.

https://scienceblog.com/16130/carbon-footprint-of-different-lifestyles-including-homeless/

You cannot reduce your consumption below that of a homeless person. It’s the sheer cost of supporting this many people, which can only be done with industrialization. If you get your food from a grocery store, if you store it in a refrigerator, if you cook it with a stove, if you eat it by the light of an electric bulb, then your 'consumption' is much higher than anyone in the developing world.

To be clear, I'm not saying that we shouldn't change our western lifestyles (I mean at this point it's too late to matter, but for the sake of the hypothetical). Just pointing out that 'reducing consumption' in any kind of meaningful way means 97% of us living on a farm without electricity, doing manual labor.

We see this not only in Ukraine, but in Georgia and Moldova where Russia supports independence movements in tiny enclaves to ensure a lack of territorial integrity.  Since territorial integrity is a requirement for joining NATO, this prevents NATO's progression toward Russia's borders and leaves them with a buffer.  The Baltic states are fortunate that they were able to integrate with both the EU and NATO during a period where Russia lacked the capacity to prevent such a move.

Certamente que a faculdade tem a sua parcela de responsabilidade para a formação do profissional.

Existem faculdades boas e referências e existem faculdades com baixa qualidade.

Existe de parcela de responsabilidade da faculdade, existe a parcela de responsabilidade do aluno.

O YouTube está recheado de vídeos de pessoas com **depoimentos sobre cursos e faculdades.** É legal dar uma olhadinha.

&amp;#x200B;

***Sobre a escolha da faculdade,*** vou deixar algumas perguntas que podem te ajudar.

&amp;#x200B;

* Quais são as 5 principais opções (se elas existem)?
* Qual a vantagem de cada opção?
* O que garante que a faculdade vai atender o seu objetivo, o que ela vai oferecer?

&amp;#x200B;

***Sobre carreira no setor privado*****,** existe alguns fatores que somam para uma boa colocação profissional, como o **networking.**

*Como fazer isso?*

Na área profissional, o **Linkedin** ganha destaque como rede para contatos profissionais. Portanto, se você usar bem essa plataforma, portas podem se abrir. 

Ela é um local, que se bem trabalhado, o ‘correr atrás’ pode aumentar o seu sucesso.

Por exemplo, você pode escrever artigos, que outras pessoas irão ler e elas podem gostar e identificar você como uma autoridade no assunto. Além de outros modos de usar a ferramenta. 

Isso pode fazer desde os primeiros períodos da faculdade, é preciso ter algum assunto como domínio e que as pessoas gostem. 

&amp;#x200B;

No LinkedIn, **existem milhares de perfis profissionais de Advogados.** 

Lá você pode ver onde eles se graduaram, cursos que fizeram, onde trabalharam. Isso pode te trazer uma luz sobre bons caminhos, o que as pessoas fizeram. 

Claro, tem profissionais bem-sucedidos e outros profissionais sem tanto êxito. É bom procurar os melhores perfis.

Em suma, procure um pouco mais sobre as vantagens do LinkedIn. Não fique somente com o que eu escrevi aqui.

&amp;#x200B;

***Sobre ser rico,*** isso depende dos caminhos que você escolher.

Por hora, minha opinião é você não se fechar na possibilidade de ganhar dinheiro e nem alimentar tantas expectativas. Se você quiser isso, é legal observar o que as pessoas no Direito fazem para ser ricas, dentro da área de seu interesse, e que são bem-sucedidas eticamente.

Se você já fechar as portas sobre ser rico, dificilmente será. O convite é observar, sem colocar mais barreiras sobre a riqueza no Direito.

&amp;#x200B;

***Sobre ascenção profissional***

Essa pergunta vai te auxiliar a buscar mais precisamente o que você quer.

* O que faz que alguém, dentro da área que você quer, obtenha ascenção profissional? Liste 3 pontos importantes

https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/gaofbo/for_female_circumcision_see_female_genital/fp1zug4/

The commonly claimed benefits of circumcision are that it reduces the risk of getting UTIs, penile cancer, and prevents STDs. These claims are based on reports made by the American Association of Pediatrics. But there is a lot of criticism regarding their research. The important points are mentioned below:

It takes around 100 circumcisions to prevent a single UTI, and UTIs can be treated easily by other less invasive ways, like antibiotics. Not to mention, it is easily prevented with basic hygiene. 1 case of UTI may be prevented at the cost of 2 cases of haemorrhage, infection, or, in rare instances, more severe outcomes or even death. This negates whatever minuscule protective benefit circumcision might have against UTIs. And it should be noted that girls are about 10 times more likely to get UTIs and yet we do not alter their bodies to reduce their risk of infection

Penile cancer is one of the rarest forms of cancer in the Western world (∼1 case in 100,000 men per year, rarer than male breast cancer), almost always occurring at a later age with the average being 68. When diagnosed early, the disease generally has a good survival rate. 

According to the AAP report, between 909 and 322,000 circumcisions are needed to prevent 1 case of penile cancer. Penile cancer is linked to infection with HPV, which can be prevented without tissue loss through condom use and prophylactic inoculation. Incidence rates of penile cancer in the United States, where ∼75% of the non-Jewish, non-Muslim male population is circumcised, are similar to rates in northern Europe, where ≤10% of the male population is circumcised

The studies that claim circumcision prevents STDs often confuse correlation with causation. In fact, circumcision might increase the risk of contracting STDs, because it can cause pain and bleeding, increasing the risk of infection. The authors of the AAP report forget to stress that responsible use of condoms, regardless of circumcision status, will provide close to 100% reduction in risk for any STD

Another common claim is that circumcision reduces the risk of men contracting HIV by 60%. These were the results of some trials done in Africa, which found that 2.5% of intact men and 1.3% of circumcised men got HIV. The 60% figure is the relative risk (2.5%-1.2%)÷2.5%. 

The AAP also ignored the statistics showing that there was a 61% relative increase (6% absolute increase) in HIV infection among female partners of circumcised men. It appears that the number of circumcisions needed to infect a woman was 16.7, with one woman becoming infected for every 17 circumcisions performed

Moreover, there were several methodological errors in these trials:

The circumcised experimental group got more medical care, including education on the proper use of condoms

The trials were terminated early when statistical significance was reached

In one study, circumcised men's infection rates were increasing faster than the intact men's, until the study was terminated early

The circumcised group could not have sex for 4-6 weeks after the circumcision; this was excluded from the analysis and distorts the results
HIV was contracted through means other than sex
Many researchers had cultural and religious biases

The findings are also not in line with the fact that the United States combines a high prevalence of STDs and HIV infections with high circumcision rates. The situation in most European countries is the reverse: low circumcision rates combined with low HIV and STD rates. Therefore, other factors play a more important role in the spread of HIV than circumcision status. This also shows that there are alternate, less intrusive, and more effective ways of preventing HIV than circumcision, such as consistent use of condoms, safe-sex programs, easy access to antiretroviral drugs, and clean needle programs

Further criticism of the African RCTs:

Critique of African RCTs into Male Circumcision and HIV Sexual Transmission

Circumcision of male infants and children as a public health measure in developed countries: A critical assessment of recent evidence
Sexually Transmitted Infections and Male Circumcision: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis

Even if circumcision did reduce rates of HIV transmission, which it doesn't, it would be a small reduction. “The number needed to [circumcise] to prevent one HIV infection varied, from 1,231 in white males to 65 in black males, with an average in all males of 298. The model did not account for the cost of complications of circumcision. In addition, there is a risk that men may overestimate the protective effect of being circumcised and be less likely to adopt safe sex practices.”

And besides all of that, babies are not having sex. They are not transmitting ANY STDs to anyone. By the time a person is old enough to engage in sexual activities, they are old enough to decide about such body modifications for themselves

Balanitis is extremely rare. Having a surgical incision in a dirty diaper increases the risk of balanitis. This risk decreases in all males drastically after puberty. It is easily preventable with good hygiene and most cases respond to treatment in under a week

Phimosis doesn't warrant circumcision. It can be cured by stretching the foreskin gently at regular intervals. For faster results, steroid creams can also be used. If stretching doesn't work, surgery like Z-plasty and preputioplasty can be done as a last resort. None of these treatments results in the loss of tissue. Moreover, some doctors misdiagnose phimosis in young children, when they're supposed to have foreskins which can't retract, until puberty, though in some cases the foreskin becomes retractable earlier. Improper handling of the foreskins of children can cause phimosis

""An estimated 0.8% to 1.6% of boys will require circumcision before puberty, most commonly to treat phimosis. The first-line medical treatment of phimosis involves applying a topical steroid twice a day to the foreskin, accompanied by gentle traction ... allow[ing] the foreskin to become retractable in 80% of treated cases, thus usually avoiding the need for circumcision.""

Smegma and hygiene are ridiculous reasons for circumcision. Properly washing the penis is enough. If you don't wash your junk, it will get dirty, period. Foreskins aren't releasing a constant ooze of smegma. You would have to neglect your basic hygiene for some time to get a significant buildup. And even then, washing takes maybe a second or two. It's not rocket science

The legitimacy of research supporting circumcision

The literature review by the American Academy of Pediatrics, which supports circumcision, does not mention any of the functions of the foreskin, implying that it is useless

Ethicist Brian Earp shows how scientific literature can be filled with bias, how medical literature can get biased with controversial opinions disguised as systematic reviews, and how a small group of researchers with an agenda can rig a systematic review in medicine to make it say whatever they want.

Opposition to circumcision by foreign medical organizations

Other medical associations and doctors in the world, from the Netherlands, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, Germany, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, Slovenia and South Africa have stated that circumcision causes complications, have also said that the evidence supporting circumcision is insufficient and flawed, and consider the AAP's views scientifically unsound. Some of them have gone on record in opposition to non-therapeutic circumcision of boys. Some doctors in the US oppose it too

Functions of the Foreskin

The foreskin has several unique physiological functions. The foreskin represents at least a third of the penile skin. It protects the glans from abrasion and contact with clothes. It also increases sexual pleasure by sliding up and down on the shaft, stimulating the glans by alternately covering and exposing it. Not to mention that it is highly erogenous tissue in and of itself.

Attempts to legitimize FGM

Another issue with using ""health benefits"" to justify infant male circumcision is that the same poor reasons given for baby boys are the same reasons being used in attempts to legalize and legitimize FGM on girls. They will try and use the logic that: ""If it is legal on boys because there are slight medical benefits, then it should be legal and acceptable for girls as well.""",False,False,False,,,0,1588364269,,False,0,{},fp757p5,False,t3_gbceog,False,True,t1_fp5zfc0,/r/daddit/comments/gbceog/circumcision_guilt/fp757p5/,False,,1594782575,1,True,False,daddit,t5_2rxue,r/daddit,public,,0,[],

The highest in the world is 63.2 (Lesotho), and there are only 23 countries in the world with greater inequality than China. USA is almost as unequal as China at 45, but it is is an outlier among ""the West"". In comparison, Sweden is 24.9, Germany is 27, France 29.3, Australia 30.3, Canada 32.1, UK 32.4.

2 - Most developed countries, apart from the US, have free healthcare and free education up to university level. (NB: In the UK, you pay tuition fees but for 99% of people this comes from a ""student loan"" which is backed by the government. The loan is cancelled after 20 years if you can't pay it back, and you don't pay any of it back if you don't earn above a certain threshold. This means fees are no barrier to education. Other European countries have no tuition fees at all.) The US is an exception because they got arrogant from being ""numba one"" and didn't think they needed to reform. They're wrong, and they are not the standard nearer for democracy. 

3 - Most western countries have strong trade unions and legal systems. There is some coverage in Chinese media of labour unrest in Europe, and strikes, portrayed as chaos. In actual fact, these are the reasons for high degrees of equality and people do not get exploited by their bosses so much - e.g. Tenants have rights and cannot be easily evicted by their landlords, and bosses cannot fire their employees with no good reason, and if they do they can be taken to court. 

It's also worth noting that some of the most equal countries like Germany and Sweden don't have much labour unrest, and that is a result of stronger trade unions, and therefore don't need to strike. Workers vote for trade union representatives who sit in company board meetings to represent their interests. IMO these countries are the closest to socialism in the world, and China is one of the furthest countries from socialism in the world - China is a fascist country, and workers therefore have no right to organise. Socialists in the west fought and died to defeat fascism for the very reason that it crushed democracy and made it impossible for workers to organise, and as a socialist I would fight and die to stop ""Socialism with Chinese Characteristics"" spreading to my country. IMO, the CCP is the greatest enemy of socialism in the world today.

Lol, this statement alone pretty much invalidates everything you said.

Switzerland has some of the laxest gun laws in Europe and a pretty positive attitude overall towards firearms and is usually the country invoked when talking about gun control.

But it doesn't surprise me that reactionaries like you can't tell the difference, having never stepped foot in either country. Thanks for proving my point I guess.

And when progress does happen it is almost always forced by external factors leaving people no other choice.  Take for instance the first  cities which appeared right around 5500 years ago coinciding directly with the end of the Wet period in North Africa in the Middle East. This was triggered by precession but unlike previous cycles it was severely exacerbated by livestock overgrazing triggering far more rapid desertification turning much of the region from savanna to desert in less than a century. This forced refugees to flee the drying rivers to the few rivers which didn't dry up like the Nile or the Tigris and Euphrates systems which forced human populations for the first time to live in larger communities beyond just their tribe. Had it not been for this climatic trigger who can say whether cities would ever have been developed given our species had remained nomadic for millions of years.

We are living within a rare period of history where progress has become self reinforcing but this is only really existed for the last 300 or so years and had been driven by a series of coincidences enabling it to happen by removing historical factors which have retarded societal advancement previously.

This advancement was in turn a consequence of thousands of years of cultural purging of preexisting social structures by the catholic church
which promoted individuality over collectivist ideology, the large scale  loss of population to the waves of the black death opening up opportunities for social migration,this in turn lead to a weakening of the nobility enabling kings to exercise far more political power and unity enabling the rise of nations and nationalism as a political ideology. Add into the mix emerging navel technologies allowing far more extensive trade than previously possible given ships in Europe, and the rising middle class and that set the stage for a new  enlightenment driven study to emerge which would fuel rediscovery of old technologies and new developments and ideas spurring the evolution of the philosophy with social contract theory, and quite importantly the scientific method.  Throw other factors in such as the protestant reformation weakening the power of the church leaving a societal vacuum which allowed rapid divergence from preexisting cultural norms and a desire for disenfranchised groups to go elsewhere driving expansion.

While many of these events have causal connections all of these particular outcomes needed key chance events to spur them down these paths to begin with.

Without the catholic church breaking up and weakening familial clan structures compared to what they had been in the past due to the church viewing marriage among cousins as being incest the information exchange
that enabled the renaissance and enlightenment movements which set into motion the cycle of self enforcing progress.


Progress is not a linear process we must be careful to not place our current circumstances and mind sets on historical civilizations as this is a well known flaw of human psychology.  This is in fact the same mechanism why older generations have always claimed that the youth have become far more degenerate/ungrateful compared to when their generation were kids etc. as it neglects that as we grow older with tend to think differently. 

We are the consequences of thousands of coincidences, lucky breaks, unfortunate circumstances and the likes. We have evolved to spin everything into narratives which retroactively enforces the notion of inevitability but science tells us it isn't so simple. humans have always been innovative developing new innovations and ideas back well before written history but these insights have historically been lost largely due to the clan and master apprentice systems which both act to suppress the exchange of information treating it as something valuable to horde rather than share. This lack of sharing not only increases the risk of technologies getting lost often because a clan destroys it to prevent it from falling into the hands of outsiders or a master failing to pass on all their knowledge for various reasons remotely similar to what we have experienced..  Without this dispersal our modern society would never have happened at least not in a way remotely similar to our current rate of progress.",True,False,False,,,0,1588366930,,False,0,{},fp7ado3,False,t3_gbg416,False,False,t3_gbg416,/r/worldbuilding/comments/gbg416/i_feel_like_my_world_given_time_would_turn_out/fp7ado3/,False,,1594785136,4,True,False,worldbuilding,t5_2rd6n,r/worldbuilding,public,,0,[],

It is either sold or distributed free-of-charge in 35 countries, including various international regional editions. The Epoch Times websites are blocked in mainland China.

&gt;The media outlet is primarily known for promoting far-right politicians across Europe and the United States, and in particular for its promotion of U.S. President Donald Drumpf; a 2019 report showed it to be the second-largest funder of pro-Drumpf Facebook advertising after the Drumpf campaign.[10][11][12][13] The group's news sites and YouTube channels have spread conspiracy theories such as QAnon and anti-vaccination propaganda.

Quite literally this is far-right conservative propaganda.
Why is it in your mailbox? It's in _everyones_ mailbox in your neighbourhood most likely.

A print run and mailing /distribution of even several hundred thousand copies across the GTA doesn't actually cost that much. I mean, thousands yes. But the people who are behind this don't worry about the thousands of $$, they worry about the $Billions. And to get the $Billions all they have to do is win a their preferred party a few more seats in the House of Commons, get a few more trade laws or tariffs to go their way. And all that takes is convincing a few people like you that perhaps the governing party needs to change or perhaps you'll write your Senator or perhaps you should join their Facebook group and attend a rally. 

This is what propaganda in the 21st century looks like.

Não parece ser um dicionário muito extenso, mas tem a escrita normal e a escrita fonética pra pronúncias de alguns lugares diferentes (Lisboa, Rio, São Paulo, Luanda). Se eles não tiverem um arquivão com tudo, dá pra montar um crawlerzinho que extrai tudo pra um dataset e brincar com isso.

Eu tentaria filtrar por apenas palavras que tenham pronúncia idêntica em qualquer região, e em seguida filtraria qualquer palavra com acentos (possibilita que a palavra seja escrita corretamente em qualquer sistema e diminui a chance de erros). Isso já te daria um conjunto bem mais restrito de palavras pra usar.

Aí pode cair em umas situações de palavras que, apesar de terem a escrita fonética diferente, soam parecidas, o que poderia gerar confusão. Aqui eu passo estar falando uma merda gigantesca pq não sei do que tô falando, teria que falar com algum linguista pra te auxiliar, mas acho que rola isso sim.

Dont spend gems on gear ever. 
Logically you should have full s lvl60 costume page beside wings by now right ? 

Dont refine non + gear, you will replace that soon anyway and the small power gain isnt worth it.

Create all characters if you havent already, and claim all daily stuff to spend on your main.

Fuse weapons, armors and accessories to try and have atleast s++ 08 gear, ideally 09. Work through adventure mode to get access to magicites (chapter 23 iirc).

Dont forget to check out the trophy shop where you can get a free s++ for 90 trophies (shop 8).

Given that you dont really have anything to spend gems on at this time, i would personally try and buy costume deco and pray you get s+ or s++ wings (good for a couple of hundred k of cp)

Finale advice, grind like crazy.

Also, we have a guild in EU that finishes decently on all events and guildwars every week. Always top 50 atleast, usually better. Our requierement is 8m cp, but we do have a guild for all of our alts that is free tojoin. It has all max level buffs available etc. You could join that one and once you growjoin our bigguild if you are into pvp.

Trust me you really won't notice.

Also call me a liquid hater but AIOs are just not very reliable. They often fail between 2 and 4 years of use. Tower coolers basically don't wear out.

- Strongly consider upgrading to better memory. 3600 MHz/CAS 16 is ideal and should net a small but cheap performance boost. The higher spec Corsair kit is overpriced but G.Skill Trident Z Neo or RGB is about 130€.

1. It makes it sound like whites or those of European heritage are much thicker-skinned and less sensitive about representation issues.  A German typically has no problem having Germanic barbarians framed as bad-guys against Romans.  Likewise, other people, as long as the representation doesn't *seem* like an attack on the ethnicity as a whole will *mostly* be okay.
2. I think we should be *as* creative with non-European tropes as we are with European tropes.  It makes it really boring to represent Amerindian culture if you have to be 100% anthropologically accurate for a single nation.  There are lots of things you can do with language and culture which aren't the old, boring WASP stereotypes of native American, but which don't correspond neatly to one.  Feathers are a beautiful, accessible means by which to express status, beautify living spaces, connect with a god/ancestor; totem poles have universal analogues, can be a very special way to connect with ancestors/express status, mark territory, worship...

I think you're being a bit too restrictive and like I implied in my last response to you, good judgment here and respect towards people that exist today should be guiding principles; beyond that, it is important to remember that someone somewhere **will** be offended (either representation will be interpreted as offensive, inaccurate, or the lack of representation as a whole will be bemoaned).

&gt;Modern racism came into being during the ironically-named Enlightenment, as a justification of European domination over non-European people.

Scientific Racism did not come into being *as a justification* for colonial imperialism. It came into being because the Reformation had eroded the authority of the church and it's dogmatic teachings on the nature of the world, and so for the first time since the fall of Rome, European peoples began to try to understand the world as it is, not as Pope et. al. said it was. They placed emphasis on material explanations for the way things were, and above all, the scientific method. Naturally, in the absence of data and the history of practice, most the models they created confirmed priors. What is important here is that for the first time they were *trying* and honestly so. They were not simply using this opportunity to justify to themselves their immorality - on the whole their conclusions were from earnest, if misguided, attempts to understand why things were the way they were without respect to the church fathers (they wanted to know why were europeans so 'advanced', and others so 'primitive').

In broad strokes, pre-Enlightment Europe peoples were a deeply racist people, as all peoples have more or less been for as far back as we can see (evolution certainly selected for the [parochial altruism](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04981) trait). But, Carl Linnaeus did not come up with the five 'varieties' of human species in 1767 *because* he was some devilish profiteer who needed to find a justification for european imperialism. He was doing so in a good-faith effort to understand the nature human-kind, according to what facts were available to him. To quote Stephen Jay Gould, Linnaeus' taxa, ""was not in the ranked order favored by most Europeans in the racist tradition,"" adding further, ""I don't mean to deny that Linnaeus held conventional beliefs about the superiority of his own European variety over others...nevertheless, and despite these implications, the overt geometry of Linnaeus' model is not linear or heirarchical."" 


So, while it is certainly a fact that 'scientific racism' came into being with the Enlightenment, it is *not a fact* that it came into being just so euros could carry on with their dirty deeds, which is the tone and explicit meaning of your original statement. What's more, the Enlightenment is justifiably named (not 'ironically-named'). We should celebrate the fact that we inherit their tradition, despite the inaccuracy of their early conclusions. What is important is the method and the absence of religious dogmatism. If anything, we should thank the Enlightenment for planting the seeds (as is evident in Linnaeus' non-hierarchical taxa), that would allow us to rise above the tribalism that has gripped humanity for all of it's existence.

Both of voltage description ""U"" and ""V"" are proper, however it must be mentioned that in European notation ""U"" describes voltage source while ""V"" describes rather voltage potential. It means that U = V1 - V1 (voltage is a difference between voltage potentials). I agree that in IEEE and American standards voltage is described by ""V"" letter.
Very similar situation is with other electric symbols also (e.g. resistors, capacitors, current sources, etc.), where European and American standards are different.

Likewise much of what we know including the HTTP and web protocols were CERN. CERN apparently loved using NeXTSTEP though which was ahead of the game. 

Although in some ways it's nice to have global coverage and that's how we view the internet today; the other poster seems to confuse the inter- with the concept of international. Other countries is irrelevant to what the concept of a packet switched network that can route traffic and have many host and clients interdependently of the medium for communication between multiple networks - which is what the internet is. It's in general a set of protocols for interconnectivity amongst various networks. It doesn't matter if no other countries were connected or not. There are pros and cons to that and not every country technically is still. The main purpose was to be able to have various networks at various institutions be able to communicate with each-other, that's it. That the internet is largely global is simply a byproduct of the usefulness of the nature of that sort of thing. You could have your own country wide only internet, it wouldn't be ""THE"" internet, but it would an internet. It's a step up from the old time-sharing systems and the one to one connectivity that preceded it that were still often fairly specific.

Minecraft i've been playing since around 2011/2012 (i started about 1-2 patches before emeralds and bats were added) i have countless i mean COUNTLESS memories of that game, it's a game that whenever i feel bored or need something to play it's a game i can always count on to be there for me. Like a friend, i mean countless worlds, countless friends i've made. Any time i play the game it all comes back to me, i still build like shit and suck at redstone but.... It's just nice to reminisce, even though all of the friends i had on MC drifted away, i still have around 1-2 on Steam but they haven't been online in a while. I just hope wherever they are, they're safe and... I just want them to know whenever i feel down i always think of the good times we had together

World of Warcraft is a game i've been playing since 2014 maybe even earlier, right around before the release of Warlords (i know, great introduction right?) but my relationship with Warcraft goes back to being a kid and playing W3 and the original DOTA, i blame my brother who introduced me to it of course. And i remember watching him play Warcraft, i wasn't big on mmos but one day i just decided, why not i'll try it. The rest is history, i've spent countless nights i could've gotten laid just chilling and sometimes venting about problems. My guild was always there for me, and i was always there for them. I've met bounds of interesting and unique people, hell i think i saved some from suicide. I'm not a very social person IRL so most of the friends i did make were on WOW or Minecraft... Sadly much like the Minecraft situation we all just drifted away, i don't know why but one day i came on and all my Bnet friends were gone. Just disappeared, and i miss em. Hopefully one day we'll reunite in Azeroth... Hell they might even see this, so if you played a Draenei Discipline Priest on Icecrown US called Chaktaw between like 2014- early 2015. Do you remember a little gnome warrior you rented way too much gold to? i still need to pay you back on that haha.... There was also a Draenei Mage on EU, i don't remember the server but she was an actual gamer girl. I swear to god, she was probably the first WOW friend i made. But i moved to US servers and we never talked again, I'm pretty sure they quit the game and haven't come back yet but.... Whenever i visit the Draenei starting zone or Stormwind... I think of them

Oh there was also a Tauren Paladin i believe on... EU Horde i want to say? that got my little Troll to the Dark Portal at level 6, i was dead by the time we reached it but that was the first time i saw it. And it's a special moment, thankfully i uploaded a screenshot to my FB of that moment so.... At least one of my fond memories is forever immortalized on the Internet....

That's about it tho, I could also include Skyrim maybe. But that's singleplayer and i didn't learn anything profound.... Except of course

When everyone else is sitting at home watching TV Shows after work or playing video games, I decided to start my own side business, I remembered, investing $800 to purchase stock/inventory, its been over 3 years now, the side business pays 30% of my household expenses (home business). Plus all directors withdrawals goes to utilities. My day time job pay goes towards the mortgage and only small part goes towards groceries.   If i keep this going, I should be able to retire by 39 years old with a freehold house in Auckland. 

Everyone mindset is different, my co-worker mindset is to rest and relax during the weekend. But my goal is to retire earlier, so i have to work during the weekend, go around collection plastics Jerry cans, washing and rinsing them, selling as used water Jerry cans. I can easily make $50-80 per week, that goes towards my financial freedom, but not many people will get up early on the weekend and do what I do, because they don't have goals or vision.  

I had this mindset of been retired before 40 years, when i was 22 years old.

My first job out of Uni, I had to report to my work group accountant, she was a lovely lady in her early late 40's, I randomly as her about job security and i want to stay for this company as long as i can. She said bluntly, ""I don't care if I get fired, I don't need to work, but i choose to work""  It got me very interested, in my mind, how the hell can someone say that, she must be loaded with $$, few months passed, I got to know more and more, by asking her questions during breaks. She mentioned to me, her and the husband before they got marriage, in there late 20's, came up with a plan, they sat down and wrote on an A3 piece pf paper, a ""Action Vision Plan"" one point she wrote was 'I want to retire before 50', underneath that, there were steps/actions, she told me they both agreed and wrote  down, the following: 

1. Increase Income
2. Passive income 
3. Invest in real estate 
4. Spend only on necessities, the rest goes into investment or savings account
5. Frugal living 

After half of year, she opened up even more, she told me she bought her first house with her husband and they rented out rooms for the first 3 years, and then they moved to Europe because her husband scored a high paying job,  once her husband contract was over/expired in Europe they moved to Australia.  While they were doing all this, they keep their first house and rented it out. They came back and bought more houses, she told during her weekends she will go out with her husband to view open homes, learn and study the market, this was when before the housing boom in Auckland, she bought stand alone houses and use her equity and bought a commercial building in Auckland. 

2 years later, she got fired, now she is working at home as an accountant for few clients, the rest of her time she just studies, always learning new things, coding, website development. Her husband is retired and spends most of his days reading books or gardening.  I went and visit her last year, she built a new 2 story house down the back on an existing section, the front house paid all the unities plus left surplus for her house new house. She doesn't have any kids, so she is very generous and pays schooling for her sister kids and helps out her brother when she needs help. 

So inspiration, I had to tell me my girl friend, we learn't from her and wrote a Action Vision plan also. Couple of the points, we (GF and I) agreed on is increase our income and only spend money on necessitates, but we did splurge out end of last year on a washer and dryer combo Fisher and Paykel, our washing machine died, so we ended up getting a washer and dryer combo, but we hunted down bargain rather than paying retail price of $2499 we paid only $992 delivered, because the boxed was damaged, the washing machine was perfectly fine.

&gt; Yeah it is. It’s literally just a film. You grew up as a spawn of the corporatization and greasy assfucking of the corpse of that film. 

Asinine take. Star Wars would have been a waste of worldbuilding without allowing further development of the galaxy far, far away. Hell, your argument could be used to say that even ESB and ROTJ shouldn't exist.

&gt;  it's a multimedia franchise,
&gt; No. 

I'm just going to quote you on this one.

&gt; Zero argument. This means nothing.

It was funny though, so there's that.

&gt; Yeah exactly George was a fucking hack. The writing was on the walls the entire time. He spent the 90s shilling for his VFX company by shoving cartoon dinosaurs into the rereleases. He destroyed the franchise and sold it to Disney for parts.

I don't think you understand how much non-film media existed for the franchise before Lucas even got around to the Special Edition edits.

&gt; No. Fuck no. And I guarantee you’ll probably do a 180 when it comes to criticizing the ST.

No. It's actually one of my biggest critiques with the ST, because the same EU canon wipe I criticized earlier left a 30-year void in the timeline that Lucasfilm filled with *Aftermath*, which was insultingly terrible and made the entire post-ROTJ Rebellion-to-Republic era of absolutely zero interest. It was one of the *most* interesting parts of the timeline before Disney wiped it.

&gt; they do that IN THE PREQUELS WHICH IS THEY THEY SUCK. He didn’t give a fuck about filmmaking or screenwriting or directing or editing or anything other than setting up franchises and expanding IP. And it shows.

You're simultaneously giving Lucas too much and too little credit here. I've criticized the prequels multiple times for only allowing three years for the Clone Wars, which is the time period that's seen the most extra-film content by far. Had this been some insidious plan from the outset, they wouldn't have pigeonholed themselves to that degree.

&gt; ...and to my point, all of that was integrated with existing canon with minor retcons,
&gt; No.

Gonna step out on a limb here and assume you haven't actually read any of the stuff you keep raging about, because this is where the rebuttal would normally go if you had one.

&gt; Worst thing in any Star Wars movie. And fuck you it was a goddamn joke. If you were the same edgy contrarian tween then that you are now, you’d be exactly what you are about the ST at the PT.

Work on your delivery. I'm not even sure what you're talking about in that second sentence. Maybe take a deep breath or something.

&gt; Again this is a discussion about FILM trilogies. Not pulp fiction trash that was being pumped out for decades to leach of the franchise. The Jedi Academy trilogy ruined fucking Jedi then. Fuck that retarded shit. It ruins Empire to say that the Jedi were a celibate cult of child abducting people wearing desert robes everywhere. I don’t care if a book corroborates it. 

Again, really looking like you haven't read any of this stuff in order to comment on it. The original trilogy itself refers to Force sensitivity as relative from person to person (e.g. ""strong"" with someone). Finding in-universe ways to measure that is logical extrapolation and not contradictory in the slightest, barring your obstinate headcanon.

&gt; Strawman argument. This is passive lying. Has nothing to do with “nice places.” They’re standing around in a green soundstage with a bunch of cartoony “nice places” added in post.
&gt;Also this is a stupid argument. Having ANY “actors walking on treadmills in a PS1 environment” shots makes a movie trash. It doesn’t make it better that it briefly jumps to a jarringly-different location shoot in the desert after 30 minutes of monks standing around in a half-tendered cartoon setting. That destroys continuity and flow. 

Maybe I gave your argument more credit than it deserved. I thought you were actually complaining about the world building, but you just don't like that they shot it with CGI? Why do you care about the fiction at all? Why not just watch a documentary on practical effects? These things exist to serve the fiction, not the other way around.

&gt; Yeah it went from being “American graffiti in space” with a bunch of spoiled high school kids looking for jobs in ANH, to an Arab bug slave market / death race hub.

Not sure if you've noticed, but for a sample size of one, we've proven that a single planet can have ""American graffiti"" and Arab slave markets/death race hubs. Mos Eisley was obviously not the only city on the planet.

&gt; Anakin impossibly skydiving into the exact hovercar he was looking for without stress and Obi-Wan insanely diving out of a window to ride a droid kind of ruined the location though. 

Most of the PT's action sequences were over the top like that. The second half of the Ani/Obi duel in ROTS was probably the worst. The setpieces were still good though.

&gt; Yeah then it was just LAVA PLANET and RANDOM INDUSTRIAL ASSEMBLY LINE and shit. It was still all entirely digital nonsense. The practical production was terrible.

Star Wars has had a thing for mono-environmental planets ever since the first one. ""Lava planet"" is honestly less ridiculous than a planet that's entirely forested.

&gt; Luke was ruined but that was all fucking Rian’s fault. TFA did a nice comfy layup and TLJ fucking spiked it away.

My running theory is that Rian just hates JJ for some reason that we aren't privy to. I can't imagine jacking up a handoff that hard even if you're too drunk to drive the entire time.

&gt; No you can see things as the the whole gestalt and then analyze the parts individually. Saying “the Star Wars prequels are good movies because of a Cartoon Network show” isn’t valid film criticism. You can say you enjoyed the corporatization of the franchise and consuming the supplemental product, but that has nothing to do with determining if a movie was well produced and a creative vision was well-executed.
&gt; Like is Transformers Revenge of the Fallen a good movie because I had an Optimus prime toy as a kid?

If the content spawned by a franchise's initial seed is good, then the original content is improved for its sake. Had Star Wars ceased immediately after production of the first film in 1977, it would be nothing today, just another has-been blockbuster referenced on occasion in film schools for special effects. Star Wars lingers because of the fiction, and fictional universes are built, enhanced, and maintained through multimedia. It's usually corporatized and money-grubbing because writers, programmers, modelers, and concept artists have to eat and pay rent, and George would have been an idiot not to profit off his baby.

Also, don't mistake me for saying that the prequels can't be criticized because the spinoffs are good. My initial argument was only that the quality of their sandbox for such spinoffs made them better than the *sequels*, which is a pretty damn low bar. There's a lot of missteps to poke at in the prequels (and RotJ too) but I always look at it as a total package, because at the end of a decade or two I've spent *orders of magnitude* more time interacting with novels, comics, television shows, and video games spun off the films than I have watching the films themselves.",True,False,False,,,0,1588386528,,False,0,{},fp890fm,False,t3_gbkgp9,False,True,t1_fp80e4l,/r/OTMemes/comments/gbkgp9/the_prequels_are_still_some_of_the_worst_big/fp890fm/,False,,1594801710,3,True,False,OTMemes,t5_3itr1,r/OTMemes,public,,0,[],

Twitter said that this access could also be used by approved applicants working on crisis management, emergency response or communication within communities, as well as those developing machine learning and data tools to help the scientific community understand COVID-19.
Social media platforms have both introduced new policies to curb COVID-19 misinformation and warned that there may be errors due to their reliance on more automated moderation systems during the pandemic. Researchers studying the platforms have argued that the companies must collect data about this period.
European Commissioner Vera Jourova called Twitter’s move “a good step in the right direction.”
“Our cooperation and regular contacts with online platforms to fight disinformation are bearing fruit. I have constantly underlined the importance for researchers to have better access to useful non-personal data and tools,” she said.
Last week, 75 groups and individuals, including digital rights and free speech organizations, wrote an open letter to social media platforms asking them to preserve and publish their content moderation data.
However, Twitter said that once tweets were taken down, they would have to be removed from this COVID-19 data set.
Currently, Twitter’s free, public API access offers a small percentage of its full stream of tweets, although the company does provide greater levels of access to paying clients.
Twitter said it had never offered a full stream on a particular topic before, and that it represented tens of thousands of dollars per month in data.
Researchers will be able to access tweets created from the moment they connect to the data set, but it will not provide historical data.
In the blog post, it said that any developer or researcher with an approved Twitter developer account can apply for access to the COVID-19 stream endpoint, but they must meet a set of requirements, including that the use case supports “the public good.”
Applicants will also have to explain how they will protect the privacy and safety of people represented in the data.

Felix was wearing a military uniform this time, with three stars on his shoulder. Although Ora had been made aware of his identity much earlier, but compared to when he was dressed in a western suit and leather shoes, Ora seemed to be looking at a different person this time. They sat down on the balcony facing the sea -- by now the sun had already set over the city behind the villa, and before them was the hazy Atlantic Ocean with its shadowy waves.!&lt;

&gt;!Felix said, ""Doctor, you must have brought me the figure I wanted. Oh, no need to tell me right away -- I know it's an astronomical figure for you, but if all goes well, you will have no problem getting it. However, before that, we must speak frankly, absolutely frankly -- it will do you and my side a lot of good.""!&lt;

&gt;!""I've always been very frank with you, but that is not how you've been with me; presently, I know virtually nothing about that side of you."" Ora said.!&lt;

&gt;!""You'll know soon enough - but first I must ask you an extremely blunt question, as this is a matter of great importance, so please understand. My question is: How do you really feel about this country?""!&lt;

&gt;!Ora said mildly, ""General, I'm not interested in politics. But even in the United States, at MIT, politics was also problematic for me. When I was studying for my doctorate, the President of the Institute was James. D. Wiesner^9 -- you probably know him, he was President Kennedy's Science Advisor. Under his influence, MIT became heavily involved in military research; but at the same time, the Institute's School of Architecture and Planning was the kind of mainstream institution that aligned with the far left. This made the political situation within the Institute extremely complicated. Speaking for myself, it was impossible that Boston's inherent racial tensions with being 23% black would not affect MIT; and as a black immigrant who was scaling to such heights, not in the MIT football team, but in the field of academia instead -- there were naturally some very unsettling things....""!&lt;

&gt;!""Doctor -- I'm referring to this country, not its politics.""!&lt;

&gt;!Ora got up and leaned over the railings on the balcony as he watched the colors of the night falling over the sea, ""General, I can tell the difference between the two. Unlike ordinary immigrants, my father and I first went to Europe and -- having no money for plane tickets -- got ourselves on board a freighter over there, before making it to shore in the New York harbor. I remember it was late at night, and we had taken a ferry to the Statue of Liberty after disembarking, when I read the sonnet by Emma Lazarus at the base of Lady Liberty over and over again:""!&lt;

&gt;!""Give me your tired, your poor,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!""!&lt;

&gt;!""I saw night-time Manhattan far off in the distance, and it was like the cross-section of a large gem glowing brilliantly in the colors of the night. You might know how we -- us poor people coming out of that poor continent -- felt at that time; I had tears rolling down my face by then.... And it turned out that I wasn't wrong about this country -- despite some misfortunes here and there, and even some shadiness; but as a self-made person determined to do all that I can, I still broke through the glass ceilings of American society one after another, and proved my own worth. I love the United States, even if I can't quite sacrifice myself without any hesitation like Nathan Hale did -- but, General, if this country needs me to do certain things, I'll definitely do all I can.""!&lt;

&gt;!Felix said: ""Well, Doctor, this country's really got a problem. Presently, the United States is facing the worst crisis in military strength since the Vietnam War -- from the boot camp in South Carolina to our naval base on Guam -- and there is every indication that the military strength of each service is now dangerously low. There are too few volunteers enlisting, and too many people leaving the military, so it is extremely difficult for the services to meet their enlistment targets every year. The reason for this is that economic prosperity has presented more opportunities to earn even more money than a life of military service; while the values and outlook of the 'internet generation' has also been in a constant state of flux.""!&lt;

&gt;!""Conventional mobilization cannot turn around this decline in prospective service members for the United States. The services must recruit more and more people who are not interested in the military, who will then be leaving the services at a higher rate. As a result, the work load of career soldiers just gets heavier and heavier, which reminds us of the staffing shortages in the American military right after the end of the Vietnam War.""!&lt;

&gt;!""At the same time, looking at political trends both internationally and domestically, it is not possible for us to retain the existing numbers in our military. The whole world is presently going through a troop reduction phase together -- but if we reduce our numbers along with the others, things would get very scary. No other country on this planet has our kind of needs: the capability to wage two high-intensity wars, at the same time and in the farthest places away from home soil. So if we go with the flow, we'll lose everything. And looking back at domestic politics, the major interest groups were all too eager to get a piece of the peace dividends after the Cold War; but it's been nearly a decade now, and they've been disappointed with what they've gotten, so the voices clamoring for disarmament are ringing out again.""!&lt;

&gt;!""Therefore, the Pentagon must make preparations for this: to carry out current military missions, or even more numerous and difficult ones, with a much smaller military in the 21st century; that is to say, we need soldiers of much higher caliber than what we have now.""!&lt;

&gt;!""From the American youths of today, we can recruit soldiers who act like scientists, soldiers who act like engineers, soldiers who act like artists -- but soldiers who act like soldiers are getting harder to find, even though these kinds of people are the soul of the military. The process of modernization is, in a sense, the process of feminization in the mental disposition of humanity; for the young people of modern America, it is getting harder and harder to endure the physical and mental stresses of war -- even if it's just sitting down in front of a computer to control a cruise missile, these stresses still exist. To make matters worse, pacifism is getting more popular in the country now, and has become a kind of public nuisance; this makes it harder than it was during the Vietnam War for American soldiers to cope with enemy casualties as well as their own -- the composure required of a superior soldier in the face of a blood bath, has been deemed by the public and the media to be a kind of perversion. While our enemies, because most of them are still stuck in less developed societies, would have soldiers who are superior in their mental caliber than our own.""!&lt;

&gt;!""Some accuse the American military of deeper and deeper leanings towards technological zealotry, but I personally see nothing wrong with technological zealotry -- technological superiority is still what the United States can rely on for an absolute advantage, so the problem for us is that our zealotry for it now is neither deep enough nor broad enough; if technology can provide with us aircraft carriers, cruise missiles and stealth bombers, then why can't it provide us with superior soldiers? Doctor, I think I've made my intentions very clear.""!&lt;

&gt;!Ora nodded as he mused, then said, ""Before this, what were some of the things that you've been doing?""!&lt;

I’ve only just began seriously looking this last week. I’m looking at schools outside of the United States and Asia (where myself and my wife are from, respectively.) I suppose like most educators, I have the dream of a PhD in one of the high education ranking countries in Europe.

&gt; Do you want a R1 equivalent research level only or are you more flexible?

This is the sort of question I would love some assistance from people further along than me with. Maybe I don’t recognize how important that is for my career but **my immediate reaction is to say I’m more flexible.** I, generally, like to research odd smaller issues and interesting “edge case” things and I’m not sure that is suited to an R1 type institution. 

Examples might be: researching if the percentage of class room environment utilization between learner inquiry based zones (reading corners, learning or hands on stations, etc) versus instructor focused spaces (teacher’s workspace, personal student desk space, shelving, etc) impacts learner perception of challenge/comfort in their studies.

Or maybe, a small research project with 500 students to see if their perception of their own competence and their instructors competence in a subject changes based on whether the instructor used certain titles and speech patterns with the students.

&gt; Do you want to be in STEM (science technology engineering math) for your phd major or stick to education programs only?

My understanding is I would need to be in an education program to do the research I would like to do, but I wouldn’t mind a STEM program at all. My understanding is that because neither my undergrad or masters are in the sciences, I wouldn’t be granted entry into a STEM PhD program, so education is my best chance going forward. 

Right now, I am thinking I want to research the further development of STEM curricula using different pedagogical approaches and subject matters that aren’t yet readily accessible to the majority of young learners (wearable computing, solar energy systems, Aquaponics, basic electronics, algebra/geometry in nature, etc.)

Ele foi eleito porque conseguiu chamar pra si a fama do plano real. Não fosse isso, é provável que o candidato à presidência pelo PSDB fosse Mário Covas.

Só depois que ele perdeu popularidade que a ideia de privatização ficou radioativa por uns anos, quase como investimento público hoje depois do PAC. A economia parecia muito bem entre 1996 e 1997.

Logo no começo do mandato em 99, tiveram mudanças drásticas que afetaram bem a economia e 99 e 2000 foram anos ruins. 2001 foi mais ou menos por causa da crise do apagão. Isso tudo foi minando a popularidade dele. Um cara que foi eleito em primeiro turno estava tão mal visto no fim do governo que até o [candidato do partido dele falava em mudança em 2002](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kfHCuFNwOk). [Outro vídeo do Serra falando em mudança](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbfucjlOHeY). 2002 foi um ano bom, mas a galera teve um medinho do Lula e então ficou no mais ou menos.

A coisa boa é que ele usou da falta de popularidade pra limpar a casa com um ajuste fiscal. O Lula continuou com essa política nos primeiros anos de mandato.

So European Jews joined their Middle Eastern Jewish cousins. Today, Israel is half Middle Eastern, not European origin. ""Go back to Poland"" doesn't work when the majority of people are third generation, many much further back, and many fled or were expelled from Arab lands they can't return to.

 Segundo relato desses parlamentares, a atitude de Bolsonaro se deu em dois atos: primeiro, forçou a [demissão de Sergio Moro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/ao-anunciar-demissao-moro-critica-interferencia-de-bolsonaro-na-pf-e-destaca-autonomia-em-gestoes-do-pt.shtml) (Justiça), que no começo da gestão chegou a ser considerado “indemissível”, justamente em um contexto de que tem a palavra final sobre cargos-chave. Antes da exoneração, ele havia deixado claro em reunião com todos os ministros que a prerrogativa de fazer nomeações no governo era dele.

 Depois, reafirmou a quem ficou, em encontros coletivos e a sós, que ele irá distribuir postos de segundo e terceiro escalão ao centrão e que não aceitará recusas. A conduta do presidente foi confirmada por integrantes do governo à **Folha**.

 Demonizado na campanha por Bolsonaro como sendo exemplo do que chama de [velha política](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/03/bolsonaro-nao-vai-abrir-mao-de-abdicar-da-velha-politica-afirma-lider-do-governo.shtml), formada por parlamentares [adeptos ao “toma lá, dá cá”](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/12/gestao-bolsonaro-propoe-novo-toma-la-da-ca.shtml), o centrão reúne cerca de 200 dos 513 deputados e virou a esperança do presidente de, pela primeira vez, ter base de sustentação no Congresso.

 Ao mesmo tempo em que promoveu uma ruptura pública com o presidente da Câmara, Rodrigo Maia (DEM-RJ), [Bolsonaro passou a procurar um a um líderes e presidentes de partidos do grupo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/depois-do-centrao-bolsonaro-acena-com-cargos-ao-mdb-e-dem.shtml), formado principalmente por PP, PL, Republicanos, PTB e PSD —esse último nega fazer parte, mas integra oficialmente o bloco do centrão na Câmara, liderado pelo deputado Arthur Lira (PP-AL).

 O repasse de cargos ao centrão perpassa secretarias estratégicas em ministérios e vai do Porto de Santos à Funasa (Fundação Nacional de Saúde).

  O grupo aceitou de pronto as ofertas —ainda não entregues, devido à burocracia federal para as trocas e o prosseguimento de acertos específicos— e saiu em defesa do presidente no Congresso, rechaçando a possibilidade de abertura de processo de impeachment contra ele, situação que passou a ser aventada com mais força após a participação de Bolsonaro em atos de rua favoráveis ao fechamento do Congresso e do Supremo Tribunal Federal.

 Para evitar esse risco, Bolsonaro precisa ter ao seu lado pelo menos 171 dos 513 deputados federais.  
 Em outra frente, o centrão também apoiou a queda de Moro, mas aí a rixa do grupo com o ex-xerife da Lava Jato é antiga. A operação baseada em Curitiba levou ao banco dos réus vários dos líderes do grupo, sob acusação de desvio de recursos da Petrobras.

 A **Folha **ouviu relatos de líderes do centrão e de ministros de Bolsonaro, que falaram sob condição de anonimato.

 Segundo eles, o presidente já foi cobrado pela relativa demora nas nomeações e, como resposta, disse a ministros que eles têm que abrigar os indicados pelo centrão, sob pena de perder apoios.

 Integrantes do Planalto informaram que os trâmites para que os nomes sejam publicados no Diário Oficial são demorados e que os indicados devem ser formalizados a partir da próxima semana.

 Inicialmente, alguns auxiliares resistiram a entregar postos chaves de sua pasta. Segundo integrantes do centrão, os principais seriam Paulo Guedes (Economia), Tarcísio Freitas (Infraestrutura), Abraham Weintraub (Educação) e Rogério Marinho (Desenvolvimento Regional).

 Esse último, que comanda pasta com obras em vários locais que serviriam de alavanca para o plano do governo de reaquecimento da economia no pós-pandemia, deve ter que ceder a Secretaria de Mobilidade ao [Republicanos, ex-PRB, ligado à Igreja Universal do Reino de Deus](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/pragmatico-republicanos-atrai-bolsonaros-com-verba-estrutura-e-voto-evangelico.shtml). Outras secretarias da pasta são cobiçadas pelas demais siglas do centrão.

 A **Folha **perguntou ao ministro, por meio de sua assessoria, se Marinho concorda com a diretriz de Bolsonaro e se fez alguma ressalva ou estabeleceu alguma condição para a entrega dos postos. “As indicações para cargos no ministério são encaminhadas pela Secretaria de Governo após análise de critérios técnicos”, limitou-se a dizer a pasta.

 Na Educação, Weintraub terá de ceder a presidência do FNDE (Fundo Nacional para o Desenvolvimento da Educação) para o PP, além de diretorias do órgão para Republicanos e PL. Segundo relatos, quando foi avisado pelo presidente de que teria de abrigar os indicados, o ministro pediu a Bolsonaro para criar filtros que garantissem controle de gestão e mecanismos de governança nos órgãos.

 Procurado, Weintraub não respondeu às perguntas feitas, se limitando a dizer que não fala com a família Frias, proprietária da **Folha**.

 Nesta semana, os partidos já enviaram nomes à Secretaria de Vigilância em Saúde do Ministério da Saúde, que ficará com o PL, e à Secretaria de Mobilidade do Ministério do Desenvolvimento Regional, cujos postos estavam em negociação, como mostrou a **Folha**.

 Outros órgãos terão a presidência dada a um partido e as diretorias divididas entre os demais. O FNDE e o Dnocs (Departamento Nacional de Obras Contra as Secas), sob o guarda-chuva do Desenvolvimento Regional, devem ser partilhados dessa forma.

 Já o PL, além da Secretaria de Vigilância em Saúde, do time do recém-empossado ministro Nelson Teich, deverá comandar o Banco do Nordeste. O partido de Valdemar Costa Neto também queria o Dnit (Departamento Nacional de Infraestrutura de Transportes), dentro do Ministério da Infraestrutura, área que controlou por anos, mas o governo vetou.

 Outros cargos federais nos estados foram colocados, de acordo com os parlamentares, à disposição dos partidos em troca de apoio. A ideia dos líderes de siglas maiores é também trazer para a base de Bolsonaro legendas menores.

 As assessorias da Economia, Infraestrutura, assim como do Palácio do Planalto, foram procurados para se manifestar sobre as informações de oferta e distribuição de cargos ao centrão, mas não quiseram comentar.

 Quando deu início ao seu governo, Bolsonaro tentou criar uma base de apoio no Congresso negociando com frentes parlamentares (como ruralista e evangélica), escanteando líderes e presidentes de partidos. O modelo não deu certo e a situação do presidente se agravou quando ele rompeu com a cúpula do próprio partido o PSL, se desfiliando em seguida.

 Ao longo da última semana, Bolsonaro foi questionado sobre as tratativas com esses partidos, mas não deu respostas diretas e não confirmou a oferta de postos no governo.

 “Por que não vou conversar com nomes do Partido Progressista que foram meus colegas por uns 15 anos? Qual o problema? Eles que votam. Se eles têm algum pecado, o eleitor do seu estado é que deve tomar providência, não vota mais. Eu não estou aqui para julgar, condenar, acusar, pedir cassação de qualquer parlamentar.

If you like rap a lot (newer rap), even a lot of the ""rap-rock"" stuff is going to seem a bit stale to you, like Linkin Park, Rage Against the Machine, Korn, Limp Bizkit - etc.; that most people are going to mention and have mentioned here, a lot of the better stuff from that period is just so old now that it doesn't resonate as much.  


Don't get me wrong, a lot of that stuff is amazing, but if you're really in to Travis Scott and Lil Peep and them, you are looking for more interesting sound design stuff likely but also some of the emotions of the lyrics. It is hard to recommend somebody to go listen to Marilyn Manson, but, his attitude set the stage for a lot of personalities today.  


Nine Inch Nails has some amazing stuff, IMO, but on the surface if you know ""Closer ( the ""I want to fuck you like an ANIMAL!""!), song, then you have an idea that Nine Inch Nails kind of crosses over and really isn't rock, but industrial.   


You might enjoy some stuff like Green Day or even Sum 41 - the younger you are, more the latter, but albums like ""Dookie"" by Green Day are immense classics, often overlooked by people just spouting to go listen to Nirvana, as if we haven't all heard all of Nevermind (famous Nirvana album) and most of Dookie on the radio - both albums by both bands shared an uncommon amount of #1 hits. But, unlike the angsty depression that permeates Kurt Cobain (lead singer of Nirvana that killed himself), Green Day has a more ""fuck authority"", chill, smoke weed, write love songs type of vibe - especially their older stuff when they were younger. This pop-punk vibe carried over through some other great bands (like Sum 41 and a host of others I dare not even mention here for fear of getting off track), but if you like Lil Peep, those vibes are all through some of those older bands.  


Smashing Pumpkins is a pretty good band also, but they are more ""grunge"" type - which Nirvana and other bands being mentioned are also ""Grunge"".   


Anything outside of really old rock music that gets mentioned here (from the 1970s and such) are things you have probably heard at some point or another even by accident.   


So let's break down some areas here to make a distinction, we've almost entirely were stuck in the 1990s with much of what I mentioned (and much of what else is in this thread).  


There are some really cool ""alternative"" rock / pop bands that are amazing that you might like, which are more modern. Gorillaz gets mentioned a lot, but you might also like MGMT, Foster the People, Twenty One Pilots and other similar groups / artists, but a lot of that stuff is also more ""pop"". If you liked some grunge bands, like Smashing Pumpkins, a good modern analogue would be Silversun Pickups (once seen a Youtube comment calling one of their albums ""The fourth best Smashing Pumpkins album""), both great bands, but also a particular vibe. Some of similar stuff has been called ""Shoe-Gaze"", and you might be able to hear why, and if that is your vibe (space out and chill and be artistic), you might dig them, and some of the artists you mentioned are in line with that type of aura.  


It is also worth mentioning here, I'm not going too far into ""rap"" music that is ""rock"". Ask Juggalos, Insane Clown Posse, Twiztid (etc.) are often considered rap by people who listen to rock music, and rock by people who listen to rap music, a real middle-ground for all means and purposes, but unless you plan on starting to drink Faygo and painting your face, I'd stay away from that crowd, because it is real easy to get in it too deep.  


Personally, I was always a fan of that ""horrorcore"" stuff, so guys like Tech N9ne get cast aside into some ""rock"" group, Three Six Mafia, Bone Thugs and other rap groups even get treated like this sometimes by ""rap fans"" - when old school hip hop heads get together, it is all a bunch of East Coast / West Coast shit with them and they forget about the South - so if you aren't already up on the ""new"" classics like Jeezy, Gotti, Trick Daddy, Lil Wayne, Ludacris and them - I suggest you check all that shit out, it seems you mentioned only a lot of newer rappers that are younger - generations been came before with some real bangers and most of the guys you mentioned (as a DJ), don't really got no club bangers, and this is coming from somebody with \~5k hours in as a live DJ, it isn't being disrespectful, but T-Pain going to turn the club out. Lil Peep going to clear the club out.   


One thing I would recommend, is try you some electronic music. IMO, rock music died out years ago. You still got some good old bands kicking around, but a lot of them are worse for the wear and not worth listening to any more. A lot of ""modern rock"" music, has been, and will be, what I call ""white trash rock"", stuff like Nickle Back, which is just, in my opinion, utter trash. If you can picture some Chad in a lifted truck with a rebel flag and his sister on his lap singing along the lyrics, that is the type of rock music which seemed to take hold and become popular. I had a lot of hope that newer bands would be more similar to say, Chevelle (which is somewhere between Tool and Creed, tbh), but most of the newer bands are just like... super commercial manufactured garbage. The same way Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande are pushed on people (and I'm NOT calling them garbage, I actually think they are both good artists, hate me) = most modern rock bands are the same way, some record exec is pulling the strings somewhere and shoving a certain type of music towards people.  


I tell all new DJ the same thing, people like to hear TWO THINGS:  
1.) Stuff they have heard before  
AND  
2.) Stuff they have heard before  


That is it. When a song gets blasted at somebody every time they turn on a radio driving to work or playing through their warehouse / shop / whatever, after a while, they like it, even if they hate it. Some of the best/worst songs are just incredibly catchy. I can't tell you how many times I've woke up with Roddy Ricch ""The Box"" playing on repeat in my head during my mornings, for no real good reason. Great song, but when you break it down, really?   


So, back to electronic music. If you go back around the time Nine Inch Nails (one of the best guys ever, Trent Reznor, who, as a producer, is responsible for the sound of a lot of other bands mentioned here, like Marilyn Manson). he was breaking away from ""rock"" with an industrial sound, which is like, more robotic disco even, but around the time of the late 1980s, guys were getting very creative and crazy with synths across a spectrum of genres. You have to remember, a lot of these digital and even analogue sounds we are used to didn't much exist before the 1960s, and started to gain dominance only in the 1970s and 1980s before seamlessly integrating with all music around the 1990s.   


There is this sharing of cultures across the ocean that happens. The Beatles and even punk music coming from Europe, bouncing back and forth and changing styles up. A lot of 1990s ""techno"" and house music, breaks, etc.; is deeply entrenched in hip hop culture. Having two turntables to DJ is hip hop idea that we now associate with electronic music. I'll skip over some of the older more obscure stuff, but in the 1990s around when we are talking, groups like Chemical Brothers, The Prodigy \*(""Smack my Bitch up!, sure you've heard it), The Crystal Method and other ""big beat"" music started to take shape. Much of it had a kind of rock vibe to it and would often be considered rock, although some rock fans then and now would label it ""techno"" - those groups were precursors to a lot of EDM that exists now.   


You had some amazing guys like Aphex Twin who came about and created all their own genres and everything, but IMO, things started to get interesting around the late 00's, when Dub and Dubstep came about - but hear me out, before it bounced to the United States (Skrillex and such), that genre actually wasn't as abrasive or offensive, it was more focused on super low bass and came from Jamaican Dub culture (hence the name). Good Drum and Bass guys existed, a group from New Zealand called ""Pendulum"" hit a unique sound that we all are familiar with today as early as 2005 - but other artists actually exploring the genres of ""Neurofunk"" and such wouldn't actually happen until nearly a decade later in most instances.",True,False,False,,,0,1588399258,,False,0,{},fp8pzos,False,t3_gbnpz4,False,True,t3_gbnpz4,/r/ifyoulikeblank/comments/gbnpz4/i_only_listen_to_rap_but_want_to_get_into_rock/fp8pzos/,False,,1594809783,1,True,False,ifyoulikeblank,t5_2sekf,r/ifyoulikeblank,public,,0,[],

Many geopolitical pundits from the realist school would tell you NATO was the aggressor and that it blatantly disrupted and ignored the balance of power, forcing Russia's hand. International liberalism stakes too much importance to ideology while the reality is that the underlying geopolitical challenge will always be the same and ideologie is not universal. There is a certain hubris and willfull ignorance to the consequences (as Maersheimer pointed out, the notion that ""The West can do no wrong"") that is apparent when reading the many warnings from Russia and within of the repercussions.

No matter what shape or form Russia takes the biggest existential thread will always be geography:

&gt;Looking outward, Russia was a “land which had never known a friendly neighbor.” Its defining characteristic was its indefensibility. No mountain ranges or bodies of water protected its western borders. For centuries, it suffered repeated invasions. That landscape and history encouraged the emergence of a highly centralized and autocratic leadership obsessed with internal and external security. Communists had been just one variety of such leadership, peculiar to the age in which they emerged.
&gt;
&gt;The country’s western borders have always been particularly vulnerable. The European landmass west of Russia’s borders constitutes a large peninsula surrounded by the Baltic and North Seas to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Black Sea to the south. Russia, in contrast, has few maritime outlets. The Arctic Ocean is remote from its population centers. The country’s few ports are largely unusable in the winter. Turkish waters to the south, like Nordic waters to the north, can be easily blocked. During the Cold War, Norwegian, British, and Icelandic airbases also hindered Russian access to the sea.

Aggressive NATO expansion was irresponsible and wilfully ignorant. A fine example on how ideology misreads the very real balance of power. George Kennan (also a realist, mind you) puts it best. From the article:

&gt; “We have signed up to protect a whole series of countries,” the 94-year-old Kennan told the New York Times columnist Tom Friedman in 1998, “even though we have neither the resources nor the intention to do so in any serious way.” He would prove right.

2. Boris Johnson fired all those ultra-Europhiles from the Conservative party, and then won a comfortable majority at the 2019 general election. He then fired his finance minister for refusing to stand-up to the hardcore Remainers in the finance ministry, even though no one elected those bureaucrats. Johnson's entire cabinet is now constituted of hardcore Brexiteers, who won't face a general election for another four years.

During this confrontation, Amber went to court with injuries and claimed Johnny beat her, ruining his image... 



....until she was caught on tape saying some pretty memorable stuff such as “Do you know I'm a 115, well not anymore, but I was a 115lb, almost 115lb woman,' You're going to get up on the stand, Johnny, and say, she started it? Really?' Later she says “I'm sorry that I didn't, uh, uh, hit you across the face in a proper slap, but I was hitting you, it was not punching you. Babe, you're not punched,”

Fast forward after this tape and Johnny Depp goes to court to show off all the photos of injuries he’s sustained. Cuts, scratches, bruises, a cut off piece of his finger, and so on.


Ambers father threatened to kill Johnny over the phone, and A private investigator said that Amber hired him to find dirt on Johnny Depp... and turned up with nothing after interviewing over 100 people all across Europe who had known Johnny over a course of 30 years, while saying Amber is “Everything I know about Amber Heard, however (and it's a lot), seems to support the many claims that she is a lying, two-faced, bottom-feeding fame harpy, who lives by the old Hollywood code of ''hurray for me and f**k you!''

&gt; The EU has argued that because Article 12 of the Protocol foresees EU customs, veterinary and other officials overseeing customs and regulatory checks and controls carried out by UK staff on goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, then it made sense for the EU to have a physical office in Belfast.

This article is slightly better than the New York Times' previous effort, particularly where it explains exactly which groups were involved. But it fails again to link to the report it is talking about, and the gap between the Brussels-based journalist's copy and the US-based subeditor's page furniture are marked. The latter's choice of a photo of Chinese propaganda advert from Serbia (which is not even a member of the EU!) is hardly subtle.

~~I'm also intrigued that the top political quote is from a far-right French MEP who decides to use an American English idiom...incorrectly. It seems that someone went fishing and found a catch eager to jump into their net.~~

Edit: Having listened to the committee, that was a slightly wonky translation of ""le service etait pris à mains dans le confiture"", a French expression that means the service was ""caught red-handed"".

I'm also amused that they didn't bother mentioning the statement from the chair of the committee's China delegation, who criticised the NY Times report as ""unfair"" and said that he agreed with Mr. Borell that the diplomatic service had not caved in.

Another important moment from the committee omitted in the article above is this statement regarding false allegations made by the Chinese embassy in France:

&gt;It's true, this is an event not in the document made public.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[The EEAS\] decided not to put it there because they have to pay special attention that in all public assessments, they only make reference to cases that fall under the label ""disinformation"", and \[which come from\] evidence-based and open sources. In this case they - they! - considered that it may fall under a slightly different category basically referred to as activities of bullying on a diplomatic mission. And they decided not to put that on a public report to avoid inaccuracies in our terminology.  
&gt;  
&gt;But this was decided at the start, without any interference or pressure from outside, or from inside. And you can see that we do not shy away from calling out clear disinformation cases by China which are in the report.

Tank went 100% elite, sprinting ahead and pulled like the entire dungeon possible (it was Castrum) and caused a wipe. When i started speaking up about how that was not ok, he and one of the DPS started flaming.

No response to the stuff that was following, closed the chat, 3 minutes later i was kicked for whatever reason. More toxic cases started popping up in following content (so HW onwards, with SB peaking) with sadly ppl from the same 'problem servers', as I would describe them now.

I didnt want to draw comparisons or stuff, just what I wanted to get at, is:  
I am very glad for your team and your GF that you had a nice, chill and friendly party composition and didn't kick anyone. You showed that -true teamwork- and trust still exists even in MMOs.  
Cases like yours are inspiring, thanks for making the day ♥

Nieuwe vaccins Er zijn heel sterke argumenten voor intensieve internationale samenwerking voor de productie van een vaccin tegen Covid-19. Maar wie een vaccin als eerste heeft, heeft ook macht.

De grootste vaccinproducent ter wereld, het Serum Institute of India, verraste vorige week met een stunt. Directeur Adar Poonawalla kondigde aan dat hij binnenkort al begint met de productie van het Covid-19-vaccin van de universiteit van Oxford waarvan nog onbekend is of het wel werkt. „We investeren op eigen risico”, zei de 39-jarige baas van het familiebedrijf op de Indiase tv.

Als tests op mensen in het Verenigd Koninkrijk en India goed uitpakken, staat het Serum Institute binnen enkele weken klaar met twintig tot veertig miljoen doses. Het eerste vaccin kan dan al beschikbaar zijn in september of oktober, verkondigde Poonawalla, véél eerder dan de twaalf tot achttien maanden die veel wetenschappers als minimale termijn zien. Aangezien de wereld pas uitzicht op een normaal leven krijgt als er een vaccin is, mag Poonawalla verwachten dat de klanten zich zullen verdringen. De directeur hoopt op vooruitbestellingen.

Als het vaccin er zal zijn, wordt de vraag: wie gaat het krijgen? De verdeling van het felbegeerde Covid-19-vaccin wordt het grootste mondiale politieke vraagstuk van de komende maanden. Terwijl labs racen om een vaccin te ontwikkelen en fabrikanten nadenken over productielijnen, moet de politiek bedenken wie het als eerste krijgt en tegen welke prijs.

Wie een vaccin als eerste ontwikkelt wint aan prestige, wie zeggenschap heeft over een vaccin verwerft onderhandelingsmacht. Hoe wordt die macht straks ingezet?

Die vragen doemen op, nu de eerste van de ruim zeventig vaccins die wereldwijd in ontwikkeling zijn, worden getest op mensen. De Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation draagt bij aan de financiering van zeven vaccins. „Idealiter”, schreef Bill Gates op zijn blog, „zou er wereldwijde overeenstemming zijn over wie het vaccin het eerst krijgt, maar dit is onwaarschijnlijk gegeven de vele concurrerende belangen. De overheden die de fondsen beschikbaar stellen, de landen waar de proeven lopen en de plekken waar de pandemie het hevigst is kunnen allemaal aanvoeren dat zij prioriteit moeten krijgen.”

Machtige overheden lieten zich dan ook prompt gelden. De Britse minister van Volksgezondheid zei vorige week: „Het voordeel om als eerste land een goed vaccin te hebben is zo groot dat ik [Oxford] steun met alles wat we hebben.” Hij stelde 20 miljoen pond beschikbaar. De Europese Commissie stak snel 80 miljoen euro in het Duitse CureVac, na berichten dat de regering-Trump het een miljard dollar had geboden voor exclusieve rechten op een toekomstig vaccin. En een Chinese militaire academie, die werkt met biotechbedrijf CanSino, zou dagelijks telefoontjes van de militaire top krijgen of het al opschiet.

„Dit soort nationalistische, ikke-eerst-sentimenten zijn niet alleen onethisch, ze zijn ook niet in lijn met wat er nodig is om de pandemie te stoppen”, zegt Gavin Yamey, hoogleraar Gezondheidsbeleid aan de Amerikaanse Duke University. „Een land waar de pandemie ongecontroleerd rondwaart, de immuniteit laag is en het zorgstelsel zwak, zou eerder een vaccin moeten krijgen dan een land dat het goed onder controle heeft.”

„Dit vraagt om een mate van internationale samenwerking die we nooit eerder hebben gezien. Het zou ten diepste onrechtvaardig zijn als de verkrijgbaarheid afhangt van wat een land kan betalen.”

Zo is het wel gegaan met de hiv-epidemie, die vooral Afrika trof en waarbij het jaren duurde voor er genoeg goedkope hiv-remmers beschikbaar waren. Ook toen een vaccin tegen het griepvirus H1N1 werd ontwikkeld, zorgden rijke landen eerst voor zichzelf.

Anja Langenbucher van de Gates Foundation is hoopvol dat het deze keer anders zal gaan. „De hoogte van de financiering en de solidariteit wereldwijd en in Europa zijn bemoedigend.”

De Europese Unie lanceert maandag een wereldwijde ‘donatiemarathon’ waarin zij overheden en organisaties vraagt om 7,5 miljard euro. Daarmee moet de „gelijkwaardige toegang” tot tests, eventuele geneesmiddelen en vaccins mogelijk worden. De Wereldgezondheidsorganisatie (WHO) heeft met de Wereldbank, de Gates Foundation en andere organisaties een verbond gesloten om hieraan te werken. En Langenbucher hoort van de ceo’s van de grote farmabedrijven dat ze het vaccin tegen kostprijs wil leveren.

Iedereen die geld krijgt van de Gates Foundation weet dat een eindproduct toegankelijk moet zijn voor iedereen. „Dat is een voorwaarde voor al onze financiering”, zegt Langenbucher.

De Wereldbank stelt intussen voor om een „mondiale inkoopagent” aan te stellen die bestellingen plaatst voor een vaste prijs die, zegt een woordvoerder, „zowel bemoedigend moet zijn voor producenten als betaalbaar voor afnemers”. Die agent kan de vaccins verdelen volgens een systeem waarbij bijvoorbeeld eerst in alle landen de mensen in de zorg en andere vitale sectoren aan bod komen. De rest van de wereldbevolking mag daarna. Hoogleraar Gavey is lid van een internationale werkgroep die een protocol voor de verdeling opstelt.

Vaccinontwikkelaars en de productiebedrijven spreken zich nog niet uit over de vraag wie straks voorrang krijgt. De Leidse ontwikkelaar Janssen bijvoorbeeld, farmatak van het Amerikaanse Johnson &amp; Johnson, zegt alleen dat het „met meerdere betrokkenen” samenwerkt „om te zorgen dat vaccins daar waar nodig toegankelijk zijn”.

Johnson &amp; Johnson zet in op de productie van een miljard doses en zegt te verwachten dat die een stuksprijs van rond de 10 dollar zullen krijgen. Maar zelfs als dit de prijs wordt, zijn de vaccins voor arme mensen in ontwikkelingslanden onbetaalbaar.

Het Covid-vaccin schreeuwt om een multilaterale aanpak, maar het geopolitieke klimaat – denk: aanhoudende spanningen tussen de VS en China over het virus en de rol van de WHO – is daar niet naar. Wat nu?

Langenbucher: „Dat is de uitdaging waar we nu allemaal voor staan..”

I’m in love with the Gatsby aesthetic of this piece - the grape vines, the cigarette butts in the swimming pool, the listless socialite and her superficial friends. You had me hooked from the very first paragraph! But I was also left with a lot of questions, such as: why does this woman want to kill herself? What is the nature of her friendship with Leo? Who *are* all these people exactly?

**Mechanics**

Ok, so the biggest problem with this piece was the blunt, choppy prose and unvarying sentence length. If you ignore everything else I say and just focus on the prose, it would nonetheless strengthen your story tenfold.

This paragraph here: “Annie wakes up with a headache. Pleased, she notices her company is gone. He did have good timing. Awkwardly she gets her fat body off the bed and into the kitchen. Making coffee. Checking the time. A package is supposed to arrive today, from France. She has already bought the wood, now stored in the workshop. Annie is getting ready for hard work.”It’s so stilted that it reminds me of the little books in my kindergarten classroom that were supposed to teach you to read: “The dog is happy. The dog is energetic. The dog is getting ready to run. The dog runs.” I think that you are trying to go for a distanced/detached tone with these short sentences, but instead they’re bland and awkward. Yes, keep up with the detached tone if that is what you are looking for, but variation is key. Write long sentences mixed with short sentences, descriptive sentences with action sentences, etc. If it gets too repetitive, it gets boring.

**Setting**

Setting is fairly clear -  a rich woman’s mansion in a wealthy part of either the east or west coast. We can tell it is luxurious because it has a pool, a vineyard, and a movie theatre. However, I would love to see a little more description during the party scene - show me the heavy, twisting vines, the multitude of stars and the blur of people dancing and drinking while Amy sits smoking in the middle of it all, a stark contrast to the glitz of the surrounding scenery. Use setting as a tool to further the plot and help with characterization. I *did* like the way you described the mansion in the first paragraph, though I felt as though the sentence structure could have been less choppy, but that is more mechanics than setting.

**Character**

There isn’t much characterization in this piece, for Amy or for Leo. The traits I can list for Amy I can list after reading are:

* Rich
* Independent (?)

And that’s about it. I can also guess that she perhaps does not enjoy her glamorous lifestyle and has some sort of aversion to socializing, given her behavior at the party and with Leo, but this could be symptomatic of whatever is leading to her desire for suicide, as she even describes her behavior as “not feeling like herself”. Hell, I don’t even know *why* she wants to kill herself. Is she bored? Depressed? Severely mentally ill? It’s a mystery, and I get that a mystery is kind of what you are going for, but I would really like to know some more about Amy’s mental state and why she wants to kill herself. Suicide is no minor thing, and the workings of a suicidal person’s brain leading up to the time of their death can be erratic, tragic, fearful, etc, and as a writer, it is your job to do the best that you can do to show your reader those workings, the reasons why Amy has chosen to retreat from her social life, treat her close friends with disdain, and eventually take her own life.

Another strange thing was this line in the last paragraph, right before she does the deed: “Now she gets in position, takes a few breaths, thinks of Leo. Then she releases the mechanism.”Why does she think of Leo? She’s spent the last 700 or so words blowing him off, evading him, doing her best to get him out of her house, and now he’s the last thing she thinks of before she commits suicide? This is very much not in line with the portrayal of their relationship you have given us so far. You need to show that despite their interactions being hostile/cold at the time of the story due to Amy’s mental state, they were formerly very close and perhaps still care for each other deeply, otherwise Leo just comes across as an overly-involved friend who irritates and bothers Amy.

Also, who is Leo? Who is Amy? Who are the Europeans, the Campbells? How do they know each other? They give off rich socialite vibes to me, but I’m not really sure how they all know each other or who they are. In fact, I don’t even know the age or appearance of the main character or Leo - they could be 65 or 20 - and while appearance is not terribly important, age is. A 20 year old socialite killing herself is intriguing, as is a 65 year old fading glamour-girl killing herself, but the difference between each story is substantial.

All in all, I think you need to just give some more information on who your characters are, what their motivations (*especially* Amy’s) are, and the nature of their relationships with one another.

**Plot**

The plot is a little hard to trace, but I’ll try to sum it up as best I can:

Amy wakes up after a party. Her friend Leo calls her, invites her out. She declines. This is the beginning of her spiral into depression and suicidal ideation. She continues evading Leo and cutting off her former social ties, until she decides to have a flamboyant final party. At the party, she sits silently and does not interact with any of her guests, and the next morning, commits suicide.

An interesting premise, but as it stands, that’s all it is: a premise. There are no clear, pivotal scenes where important plot points are revealed to the character. Amy achieves her goal (suicide) with almost no difficulty on her part - her friend, Leo, occasionally tries to interfere, but she easily brushes him away. No one ever discovers what she’s trying to do or tries to talk her out of it. Yes, Leo “pleads with her” at the end of her grand finale party, but what about? Why are there tears in his eyes? This could be a whole scene of itself, Leo begging her to tell him what’s wrong, to stop whatever it is that she’s doing, her struggling against him. But instead you just spare two sentences on it, effectively eradicating what could potentially be a very large plot point.

By far the most significant missing thing, however, is the fact that you never even *hint* as to why Amy is committing suicide. That should be your entire plot right there! Suicide is not a fun little twist or an exciting ending for you to sneakily build up to, it is caused by a variety of factors and these factors can be very intriguing for an author to delve into, enough to make a story. I think that this piece is not complete until time is spared to hint at or show the reasons for Amy’s depression and suicide.

Also, a plot hole I noticed was that Amy only tells Leo she feels “not like herself” the morning after the party, and this appears to be the beginning of her depression, yet she has already ordered the guillotine? Why does she only start acting antisocial and withdrawn once the guillotine is ordered, since, presumably, she made the decision to commit suicide before then? I am very confused by this.

**Pacing**

As other reviewers have mentioned, your pacing is at like 10x speed. Slow it down. A *lot.* Give me some long, languorous scenes of Amy alone in her desolate mansion wherein you give me a little peek into her mind and just why on earth this rich, popular woman wants to kill herself. Give me conversations between Amy and Leo where body language and the nature of the relationship are allowed to develop gracefully, organically, and show me their conversations become increasingly tense and erratic as the day of Amy’s suicide draws nearer. Hell, spend at least 500 words, almost the amount you gave to the entire piece, on the final party and what it looks like, what Amy is like, whether or not the other characters take notice of her strange behavior, etc. You are doing yourself and this very fascinating premise a disservice by refusing to linger on the small details that make a story complete, instead whizzing through the plot points in a race to wrap things up as fast as you can.

Although I agree with other reviews that the dialogue could flow a little more and be a bit more natural, *especially* in the phone call between Leo and Amy, I thought you actually handled the dialogue really well. Lots of authors struggle to write natural dialogue and instead try to make it dramatic or overly-sentimental (I *really* have a problem with this and am jealous of authors like you who can handle it so gracefully), but you manage to write it in a way that is more believable to me than some intense, witty back-and-forths I see in lots of works. I especially believe it works in this piece because it seems you are trying to emphasize the meaninglessness of Amy’s life and how empty it feels, and the casual dialogue that avoids addressing things that are obviously terribly wrong adds to that exquisitely and makes Amy’s detached, disillusioned mindset feel very real and understandable.

**Grammar**

I didn’t really see any grammatical errors, so nice job on that front!

**Other**

Although not really important, one thing that made me laugh a little bit is that you don’t seem to really know what drugs rich people do or the slang used to describe them. When Leo says of the coke at the Europeans’ party “this powder is wild,” I kind of pictured a little nerd with glasses trying to look as cool as possible his older brother’s party by declaring his love for drugs. I mean, people who are taking party drugs and doing so casually and frequently, *and* who are presumably fairly young, will not use words like “wild” to describe coke or talk about it so enthusiastically the way Leo did. Take this from a seventeen year old who goes to a very wealthy school in a major city - kids *do not* talk about drugs like that, and if they did, they’d get laughed at. I’m guessing this doesn’t differ much among twenty- or thirty-something users, which is the age range that Amy and Leo appear to be in. Also: “She orders several boxes of fine champagnes, vodkas and whiskeys. All different kinds of party drugs she can think of.” This makes me think of Amy just calling a catering company up  like: “Hi, I’d like three boxes of cocaine, four boxes of xanax, and six boxes of acid please. Thanks!” Little details like this lessen the believability of your story, especially as it is meant to be from Amy’s POV (I think? It was rather detached but we did get to see her thoughts a couple time). It would really strengthen the whole Gatsby/socialite aesthetic you’ve got going on for you to do a little research on slang terms as well as tone down the awkward references to coke that you’re using to try and convey the wealth of your characters.

**Conclusion**

I can tell that you very badly want this to be sparsely-worded flash fiction piece, but the fact is that the plot just doesn’t lend itself to that format. I would say 1500 words *minimum* would get you where you need to be in terms of slowed down pacing, fleshed out characters, a well-developed plot, and a satisfying ending. Attempting to write such complex plots in so few words is not really a good idea for newer writers as you don’t yet have the tools to compound information into such a small space, so just stretch out and give yourself all the words you need to write this, then come back in maybe three months or so and try and cut it down to 800 words if that's what really you want it to be.

However, I believe that this piece truly has a lot of potential and that you are a clearly talented writer with the ability to fulfill that potential. You do a good job of lending a detached, disillusioned mood throughout, and I do like the contrast between the glittering, glamorous parties and Amy’s solitude, her depression, her lonely scenes in the dark. I especially liked the image of her smoking blackly at the final party, and think that if you can just describe that a little more, it will hit *hard* both through the power of its imagery and what it means for Amy as a character.

Nobody had a problem with that, until France decided they wanted gold for their dollars. After a few more countries also exchanged their dollars there wasn't enough gold left to back all the dollars, so it was decided that the US, as one of the last countries, would leave the gold standard.

Some lazy Gypsies need to learn what hunger is like so they can get an actual job.

&gt; The ""economy number"" going up is also no guarantee that people are living well. We need to make sure that the generated money actually reaches the whole population, not just the top 10%.

So as the economy develops you want to take money from the Bulgarians who are finally doing well and throw it at Gypsies so they can spend it on drugs or some other thing?

&gt; Very good! But this again just you bringing in the race/religion card into a way deeper problem. Not every bank is owned by a jew, and not every stock trader or exchange is a jew. Blaming jews for ""coming up with this business model"", is one step from blaming them for coming up with capitalism, and I'm sure you don't think that.

Adam Smith came up with capitalism and he was an Anglo. But usury and the banking system is Jewish. You can thank all of the Jewish money lenders and the Rothschilds for that. It’s not religion it’s an ethnicity. When I saw Jew I always mean the ethnicity.

&gt; Also reducing taxes won't help poor Bulgarians, quite on the contrary. Reducing taxes from 10% to 8% will mean that a person with minimum wage makes 12 leva more. (2% from 600). However, a millionaire is making 20 000 leva more.

Maybe then the millionaire can pay his staff more. That is I think one of the problems with partisan stuff on economics. A lot of these things should go together. For example a tax cut should go with an increase of the minimum wage. 

&gt; Meanwhile, healthcare gets worse, schools get worse, police is now even more underfunded, seniors get even a lower pension, infrastructure gets worse, and public transport sucks even more ass. But yeah, romas will get a little less money too, so it's worth it /s

You don’t see the connections here do you... when the birth rate is 1 and all the young Bulgarians are leaving because of EU freedom of movement, meanwhile 1/5 of the young generation is lazy Gypsies who don’t want to work, of course pensions are going to go down, of course infrastructure is going to get worse, of course everything will get worse.

There’s really no reason for us to point a finger at other countries blame them for this pandemic. The animal industry in Europe / North America is just as dangerous. According to the FAO 75% of new infectious diseases are zoonotic, meaning they start from animals and transmit to humans. This has happened many times outside East Asia (like Ebola, HIV-Aids, Swine Flu, Bird Flu, Spanish Influenza etc.)

Industrial Farms and Slaughterhouses are the perfect breeding ground for the deadliest new diseases, since animals there are in such tight and unhygienic conditions that the worst diseases can prosper, as a very deadly virus would quickly kill its host animal in nature, but if theres thousands of animals in one room no matter how quickly it spreads and kills, it will still find hosts.

Hate me and downvote me for saying this, but all the diseases I named above and Corona would never have transmitted to humans in a world where we don’t eat animals. And that is also the best thing we can do to prevent future diseases. If anyone needs help stopping to fund this industry check out: [https://www.challenge22.com/challenge22/](https://www.challenge22.com/challenge22/) or pm me if theres anything I can help you with. 

If we did that, it also protects us from antibiotic resistances, which could soon set us back to a time before Penicillin, and they arise because 80% of antibiotics are used in the animal industry to even keep the animals alive under the conditions we keep them.

That ignores the negative impact of higher taxes on growth, private pensions, and business attractiveness, and the fact that our tax take from companies is about to plummet as profitability tanks and many companies go under.

If we want to pay those staff more, realistically we'll need to raise much of the money from higher taxes on ordinary people.

It is about the coronation of Rudolf II.  

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; the crown is made of four jeweled circles  

I am not aware of any german king's, kaiser's or duke's crown that is 4 circles of jewels. I find only byzantine crowns that look like that. It would be really interesting if kaisers at that time see themself in the tradition of the *eastern* roman empire. The only other crown that comes to my mind is the lombardic ""Iron Crown"". But this was only used when the coranation was in Rome and even then only to crown the emperor as *King of Italy*. Buuut there was no King of Italy from 1556 to 1805. (Though the house of Habsburg claimed the title until 1806). Strange.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;  protect widows and students  

Is that really students? That would be a very renaissance thing to protect. I have only heard of ""to protect widows and orphants""  

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; imperial knob  

do you mean Globus cruciger, orb and cross, the *Reichsapfel*? 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; The dignity of the prince-electors is held in great reputation, and in Germany they consider it superior to that of kings

the german princes just flexed their muscles in an open war against the kaiser (1552). As a result the kaiser was forced to formaly accept the protestant (lutherian) religion. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;  the authority of the Emperor extends to all of Christianity

That claim was always idealistic and a justification of power. I never heard that someone *wanted* to be under the authority of the kaiser. I was always under the impression that especially italians did not accept to be ruled by an foreign king.  

Maybe this desire for unity comes from the wars against the turcs/osmans? Venice had just lost 4 wars against the osmans. The Habsburg–Ottoman war (1526 - 1568) could only be won by an european alliance of austria, HRE, bohemia, croatia ...   

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; so that an elector was Italian, one Spanish, one French and so on from the other nations of Christianity  

His grandfather Karl V was the last kaiser that was crowned in italy and the last one crowned by the pope (1530). Maybe the venetian ambassador felt left out since the kaisers retracted beyond the alps.  

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; great Germans are not very happy that this dignity is perpetuated in one house who wants to make it hereditary  

Since Karl V (Rudolfs grandfather) the kaisers tried to reestablish their power as a factual ruler over the princes. That did not work out. The recent uprise of the princes and the following Peace of Passau (1555) and Peace of Augsburg (1555) made clear that war, peace and religion is not the decision of the kaiser anymore. The princes and bishops will resolve their issues among themself from then on. Also religion should be a legal matter not a martial one.

If you didn't, then the airline will say - we got you there, and that's the end of it.

If you did, then you would be hanging your argument on the EC261 rights attaching to your return - whilst you wouldn't get compensation for the cancellation because of extraordinary circumstances, you would say that the duty of care that still exists as per [Denise McDonagh v Ryanair Ltd  C‑12/11](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/documents.jsf?num=C-12/11):

&gt; Articles 5(1)(b) and 9 of Regulation No 261/2004 must be interpreted as meaning that, in the event of cancellation of a flight due to ‘extraordinary circumstances’ of a duration such as that in the main proceedings, the obligation to provide care to air passengers laid down in those provisions must be complied with, and the validity of those provisions is not affected.

&gt; However, an air passenger may only obtain, by way of compensation for the failure of the air carrier to comply with its obligation referred to in Articles 5(1)(b) and 9 of Regulation No 261/2004 to provide care, reimbursement of the amounts which, in the light of the specific circumstances of each case, proved necessary, appropriate and reasonable to make up for the shortcomings of the air carrier in the provision of care to that passenger, a matter which is for the national court to assess.

You would need to argue that the recovery was necessary, appropriate and reasonable. The question is whether you want that fight or not.

That would depend on when your return flight was, I think - unless the flight home was on the 14th, then they will say you simply changed your mind and went home: they are not liable for that.

The liability would only be triggered when it came to your flight home and it was cancelled - so costs after that.

you are wrong about ""every african"" - [africa had quite a few shots with socialism](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Socialist_states_by_duration.png/1920px-Socialist_states_by_duration.png) and communism - and it only lead to countries even poor than those around it.

again, the existence of free trade is not a synonym of capitalism. just like its possible for markets to exist under socialism, its possible for them to exist without capitalism. you need a certain set of rights guaranteed by the state for the bourgeois to thrive - even marx starts talking about capitalism only after the glorious and french revolution, after the fall of the feudal state - he doesnt considers the fact that there were rich people and well developed markets before those events enough for the system to be considered capitalistic.

&gt;Why then are all free trade agreements, agreements that mostly benefit rich countries (mostly rich people of the rich countries). A good recent example is the DR-CAFTA (2004), an agreement that was forced on central american countries by the US, that only benefited US industry.

most orthodox economists agree that if done right free trade agreements are great for all parties involved - just ask the european union. you may look at isolated cases of the us using its power to bully smaller countries (something every big state always did and probably always will, including the urss) and pretend this is a feature of capitalism, but the fact is the last 30 years or so have been seeing a revolution in terms of [increment of quality of life](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/The_number_of_people_below_different_poverty_lines.svg/800px-The_number_of_people_below_different_poverty_lines.svg.png) and we are right on the way to almost destroy [the worst problems that trouble poor countries today](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/The_World_as_100_People.png)",True,False,False,,,0,1588422991,,False,0,{},fp9dbf2,False,t3_gbsb1j,False,True,t1_fp97ayf,/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/gbsb1j/communistssocialistslibertarians_stop_blaming/fp9dbf2/,False,,1594821194,1,True,False,CapitalismVSocialism,t5_3cct3,r/CapitalismVSocialism,public,,0,[],

SCORES OF street  vendors set up an open-air food market this week in Huáscar, a  shantytown in north-eastern Lima, defying Peru’s strict lockdown against  covid-19. Hundreds of seasonal workers have broken quarantine, too, to  travel back from the coast after the summer harvests to their homes in  Andean villages. In locked-down Colombia, in Bogotá suburbs like Ciudad  Bolívar and Soacha, life goes on more or less normally. Vendors offer  coffee and corn bread on the street. That picture is repeated in many  poorer parts of Latin America.

The virus struck the region a few  weeks after it laid waste to Europe and the United States. Forewarned,  many governments reacted early. By the end of March, 11 had imposed  strict lockdowns while others had closed schools and imposed rules of  social distancing. These measures have generally been popular, and they  have almost certainly blunted the impact of covid-19 so far, saving  thousands of lives.

In most cases, the minority who are not  respecting lockdowns are acting out of necessity. Data from Google,  which tracks mobile phones, show more movement in poorer states and  provinces in many countries. Several national governments, including  those in Colombia and Peru, have been swift to get emergency payments to  some of their poorer citizens. But that is a big challenge: one out of  two Latin Americans works informally, often relying on daily cash  takings. A new popular slogan holds that it is better to die of  coronavirus than of hunger.

That poses an acute problem for  governments. In Latin America generalised lockdowns can be maintained  for no more than two months, reckons the Inter-American Development  Bank. In a new paper, the bank worries that confinement will be loosened  before health facilities have expanded enough to cope, and before  governments can ensure that opening up does not lead to the uncontrolled  spread of the virus. Many countries have done little testing. Even  Chile and Peru, which have done the most, have done only half as much as  the United States, relative to their populations.

Many officials  expect the epidemic to peak in May. But they are navigating through a  fog of unknowing. Though they vary greatly across countries, the  statistical curves of infection and deaths in Latin America are slightly  below those in Europe and the United States. It is not clear why. Some  think the data are unreliable. Mexico doesn’t pretend to count more than  a sample of cases, for example. There may be other explanations. Latin  America has been good at vaccinating against diseases like measles and  tuberculosis. Some researchers think this may provide some immunity  against covid-19. And there are proportionally fewer vulnerable old  people than in Italy or Spain.

While the policymakers agonise over  the trade-off between protecting lives and livelihoods, this is likely  to be resolved on the ground and in favour of livelihoods. “To stay  closed is impossible. People are desperate,” says Alejandro Gaviria, a  Colombian former health minister. He argues for a strategy of “active  vigilance” in which officials monitor the occupation of intensive-care  beds city by city, give priority to increasing testing rather than to  more ventilators and rely more on primary health-care networks, which  are easier to expand than hospitals. Some Latin American countries have  experience in tracing infected people, from recent viral epidemics such  as Zika and chikungunya. “We don’t have to start from scratch,” notes Mr  Gaviria.

Chile and Colombia, which have relatively low infection  rates, are working towards more flexible strategies. Chile relies on a  nightly curfew and shutting commerce to enforce social distancing. Only  in 15 hotspots of infection has it imposed a strict lockdown. Having  started with one laboratory to process tests, it expanded that to more  than 50, partly by bringing the private health system under temporary  state control. Officials will also need to consider who can safely go  back to work, and organise more buses to transport them.

Ecuador,  which has had a bad outbreak, and Argentina are starting to loosen up. A  more flexible approach is harder where hospitals are overwhelmed. That  applies in Peru, in parts of Mexico (which has not locked down) and in  some Brazilian cities. Such places may have no choice but to confine  people for a bit longer. Elsewhere, trying to slow the epidemic as much  as possible while loosening the stranglehold on the economy is the hard,  but ineluctable, task.",True,False,False,,,0,1588423712,,False,0,{},fp9e63i,True,t3_gc5wau,False,False,t3_gc5wau,/r/LatinAmerica/comments/gc5wau/choosing_between_livelihoods_and_lives_in_latin/fp9e63i/,False,,1594821638,4,True,False,LatinAmerica,t5_2qioc,r/LatinAmerica,public,,0,[],

At his own COVID‑19 briefing on April 1, President Donald Trump announced that the United States was launching “enhanced counternarcotics operations” in the Caribbean near Venezuela, the scale of which is [particularly unusual for the region](https://twitter.com/adam_wola/status/1245691350344925186). Later in April, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US Treasury issued licenses for Chevron and service operators in Venezuela to stay in Venezuela until December 1, 2020, but bar the enterprises from new oil drilling, extraction, refining, or capital expenditures. In short, US policymakers are betting that Maduro will be unable to outlast all these obstacles.
&gt; 
&gt; For his part, Maduro has already created more problems. In his scramble to quell growing discontent and protests over the affordability of goods and a gasoline shortage, he [reinstated price control measures](https://www.reuters.com/article/venezuela-economy/venezuelas-maduro-warns-of-new-price-controls-as-inflation-spikes-idUSXXN2CB000) after they had been relaxed starting last year. This probably signals an increase in food scarcity and hunger, and could increase domestic pressure for political change. Adding to this, Venezuela will have to confront [the wave of migrants](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-venezuela-migrants/venezuelan-migrants-quarantined-in-crowded-shelters-as-they-return-home-idUSKBN21P361) returning from a locked down Colombia.
&gt; 
&gt; ### **The US is not looking to the long term**
&gt; 
&gt; One immediate effect the indictment had was to scuttle preliminary talks between Maduro and Guaidó over a partial truce that would allow them to make a joint appeal for international aid to deal with COVID‑19. This obviously does not auger well for the country’s immediate future or its preparation for the arrival of the pandemic. Official data are unreliable, but it appears that Venezuela has yet to fully reckon with the spread of COVID‑19. The long-term implications are almost as gloomy. The new strategy seemingly takes a negotiated solution to the country’s political crisis permanently off the table by further raising the exit costs for Maduro and his cronies.
&gt; 
&gt; As history has shown, the US has been much more effective at removing foreign dictators than rebuilding those countries. Consistent with this, the broader US strategy seems single-mindedly focused on removing Maduro rather than on re-establishing democracy and the type of diplomacy and concessions that would involve. So while the depth of the country’s economic and humanitarian crisis in combination with sustained US pressure might destabilize Maduro, a successful democratic transition will require some type of negotiated settlement as it did in South Africa after apartheid, Eastern European democracies after the Cold War, and in Latin America after the dictatorships of the 1970s. That has not been the US’s focus.
&gt; 
&gt; Regardless of the political outcome, Venezuela’s massive economic and humanitarian crisis is likely to grow worse in the months ahead. Whoever governs will have their hands full.

I have irregular cycles and went through a *lot* to rule out a any medical cause, and spent a year looking into PCOS and all the various issues with it.  This got long, sorry!

In addition to the excellent info. given by alpine\_rose, I want to share my experience.  As alpine\_rose said, PCOS is a spectrum.  A bit of googling will quickly turn up the Rotterdam Criteria, where irregular cycles plus ""polycystic ovaries"" (a lot of follicles, the threshold of what counts as a lot varies based on country, ultrasound, and doctor) can equal PCOS.  But there is a third criteria, high testosterone, which could also be paired with irregular cycles or polycystic ovaries.  Prior to going to the RE, I had had all the usual bloodwork for irregular cycles checked - thyroid, prolactin, and testosterone.  My cycles naturally are 30-65 days, plus once about 90 days, and also always eventually ovulatory.  Because my testosterone was always within the normal range\*, my total follicle count was 28, I didn't show insulin resistance, and my AMH wasn't really high, my RE said she would not put me in the category of PCOS.  I asked why I had so many follicles and irregular cycles, and she said some people are just built that way, but there's not a condition to treat that's causing it.  She said the European version of ASRM only considers it to be PCOS if there is high testosterone, and she mostly agrees with that definition. 

This may or may not be a helpful analogy:  I think of it like determining if you're tall.  You're 5'10"", and some places would say that's enough to be tall, and some would say you're not quite there, and the threshold is 6'.  Either way, you have to buy long jeans all the time.  So with irregular cycles and a lot of follicles, whether or not you have PCOS (without a major indicator like high testosterone or insulin resistance), you can probably benefit from ovulation induction to ensure ovulation happens around CD 14 to 20ish.  And if you're 5'10"", and it's a quibble over whether you're officially tall or not, you don't have to deal with the problems that come with being *really* tall, like ducking under doorways and not fitting in cars.  The worse fertility outcomes for PCOS, in my research over the past year, generally are tied to having high testosterone and/or insulin resistance, aka being *really* tall.  

I also second alpine\_rose's suggestion to discuss Letrozole.  I was started on Clomid, and respond *very well*, with 2-3 follicles on just 50 mg.  I was hoping for only 1-2! So I'll be trying Letrozole next cycle.

\*The normal range of testosterone in women is a hot discussion topic over in the r/PCOS threads.  On my lab results, the normal range went up to 70, but many people on reddit consider above 50 to be indicative of a problem.  So you can find a lot of  people who say their testosterone was in the normal range, but they go see a specialist who flags it as too high?!  Mine was between 30 and 40, tested 3 times.

 O banco Inter quer que você coloque seu dinheiro lá e invista na empresa, querem que você use o cartão de crédito com taxas de juros absurdas. (Eu cancelei meu cartão de crédito e fiquei só com conta de débito). 

Eu recomendo o banco Inter? Com certeza. Saques gratuitos na agência 24, TEDs ilimitados, depósitos por boleto (limitados, acho que 30 por mês) e corretora gratuita fazem o banco Inter ser excelente.

Eles também tem segurança. Não parecem ir a falência, mas se forem, o fundo garantidor de crédito te devolve até 250 mil reais da parcela que você tiver lá. 

Não recomendo como banco principal, mas é uma excelente instituição para investimento. Associe com uma conta no banco do Brasil usando o Pacote gratuito de serviços essenciais e fica muito bom.

I'd be more inclined to help you if you weren't excluding me from the outset. I also hope to have a part in the future, and I take great care to look the world and try and understand how my actions impact it for everyone.  
I feel for you all, but 2 things about your approach. By picking such a small group to focus on you are hamstringing yourself, I acknowledge the struggles you are going to face but you're absolutely at it if you think you are the only ones. A lot of people a lot older than you have a lot of trouble ahead too.

It's also worth noting that if we do a little research:

[https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/distribution-of-median-and-mean-income-and-tax-by-age-range-and-gender-2010-to-2011](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/distribution-of-median-and-mean-income-and-tax-by-age-range-and-gender-2010-to-2011)

We will see it's actually nonsense, the 18-25 category only accounts for a small percentage of tax receipts. You are not the future, you're just a small part of it like everyone else.

Look at ways to build bridges between your chosen 18-25 year old category and all the others that might be aligned with you. Research identity politics, this is what you are doing and it is harmful to cohesion, we need BIG BIG groups of people to change things. I think you will find that actually there are themes which people of all ages would agree with you on, spend your time searching for these and try to heavily reference things you write to let people form their own opinion.

The thing you are missing is that a lot of other people are struggling too, a lot of people have worked since they were 18 til twice your age and still have nothing to show for it. Find friends and build bridges. The world is by it's very nature unfair and if we want to change it we need to work together. I like to say life is unfair, but as members of a society it's our duty to do what we can to make it fair.

Another poster asked you to tell them which institutions have been dismantled, do this or GTFO. If you cannot talk in detail about issues and show objective roots for your assertions you will be laughed at and derided (and rightly so). You are expecting us to spend our time reading and understanding you point of view, make sure it's worth our time and show us that you have done research, and lay it out in a way that you can teach us more about reality otherwise you are just spouting unfounded opinion which gives ammunition to the people who say your age groups are ungrateful whiners ( on the whole I don't think this is true ). 

Don't be coming with a head full of opinion and hands empty of objective reasoning. Do your homework. Provide references. Seek to make it such that when people read something you have written they can walk away having learned something. Nobody cares how you feel, show us the objective reality which leads you to your feelings and maybe you will influence some people.

The world doesn't owe you, or any of us shit, it's what we make of it.

So in the spirit of demonstration, what do I think are some common themes that affect us all?  


Corporate taxation is a mess. The complexity of tax code has several impacts. Firstly, we NEED accountants (for small businesses) as an individual in general cannot be expected to understand the systems (that's mad right?). It creates an advantage for larger companies as there is an overhead which doesn't scale linearly with revenue of a business (I mean to say, a company earning 10x more will not likely pay 10x more to their accountants, so the costs are skewed to be a larger % for small businesses). The complicated tax codes are also what help to create the revolving door system between government/civil service and large companies as only a few people hold expertise on the system. People tend to implement tax code and then end up working with companies to help them navigate it. To me that's fucked. This also feeds in to a lot of the big companies paying next to no tax. Something MUST be done about this, but I don't know what.

A big deal for me is how little we pay teachers, you're past this part but honestly if I was to budget I would prioritise education, our ability to change the world follows from our ability to reason about and understand it. There's a lot of shitty logic going around these days.

Have a little look into UK productivity versus other countries in Europe, for some reason we're utterly shit. I think this is related to swollen bureaucracy and again overly complicated sets of rules:

I see another crisis going on, but I haven't really done my homework here yet to make good comparisons. I think standards of honesty are dropping in general though. So many people are making faulty and disingenuous arguments and it's very easy to look at the current government and point out blatant attempts to change the appearance of things rather than their underlying reality. Note though, it's happening everywhere on all the sides, dishonesty is becoming a new norm and people justify it as ""well they are doing it"". Without honesty we can make no progress.

Sou uma romântica incorrigível e depois de tantos amores eternos que chegaram ao final inevitável, encontrei um amor possível...e só é possível justamente por ser impossível...moramos a 18.000km de distância, em lados opostos do globo.
As vezes me pego refletindo se não é essa impossibilidade, essa dificuldade e toda a expectativa que criamos que torna isso tudo tão especial, tão raro, tão sagrado...uma parte de mim teme que ao se tornar fisicamente possível, o encanto acabe e as lentes do amor sejam retiradas...sabe aquela sensação de olhar uma foto sem filtro? Tenho medo que o meu amor ""idealizado"" se transforme em um filme de produção independente com a fotografia extremamente realista...Mas aposto no amor mesmo assim...demorei 33 anos para encontrar alguém disposto a sair do raso e mergulhar comigo. Eu encaro as ameaças das redes sociais com a cabeça erguida e com a certeza de que a minha alma e coração são mais valiosos que qualquer promessa de um amor passageiro...com a esperança de ter encontrado alguém que prefere uma conexão maior e mais profunda à um corpo vazio...talvez seja ingenuidade da minha parte querer acreditar que isso é possivel...
Se eu estiver errada e quebrar meu coraçãozinho novamente, não tem problema...

The big difference is that, generally speaking, English speakers only speak English while most French speakers also speak English. For Europeans, English is a “utility” language and they start learning it when they’re very young. It’s not a pretty language, but it’s “easy” and it gets the job done. Additionally, the US totally dominantes Western media, so most of the movies, music, and TV shows that are popular across Europe are originally in English. Even here, on Reddit, the stunning majority of the content is in English. So English is a very handy tool to have and Europeans interact with it on an almost daily basis. 

I can’t speak for France, but in Germany, this is somewhat of a topic because English has more or less taken over professional and technical language. This causes two problems: German publications end up in “Denglisch” and people who live in Germany can’t speak German. Scientists write everything in English so they can collaborate with the rest of the world. When they write German publications, they usually leave the technical English words alone, as the German translations are seldomly used. This means you have to know some English to read a German publication, which is kind of obnoxious. Furthermore, a lot of English speakers who move to Germany never bother to learn German. People live in Germany for 10+ years, but don’t speak a lick of German, because they can get away with only speaking English. Again, this is obnoxious.

Even so, most Germans don't really care. In reality, they’re just as bad as Americans at not learning other languages. For example, sure everyone in Germany speaks English but very few also speak French. This is kind of a copout, though, because English is really easy for German speakers to learn. They also get really excited to flex their English language abilities and only Boomers really have an issue with “Denglisch.” These are also the people who roll up to Spain and try to speak German with the locals.",True,False,False,,,0,1588431264,,False,0,{},fp9oob3,False,t3_gc2ygr,False,False,t3_gc2ygr,/r/GlobalTalk/comments/gc2ygr/question_people_of_france_how_do_you_feel_about/fp9oob3/,False,,1594826896,6,True,False,GlobalTalk,t5_mg3b6,r/GlobalTalk,public,,0,[],

&amp;nbsp;


In the meantime, as the celebrations for the failed strike begun to relent, international matters – or, more properly, the “national” matter of Fiume – returned to occupy a place of prominence in Mussolini's *Popolo d'Italia*. Already on the 23^rd – after the previous issues had focused mostly on the relations between the French Government and the *CGdT* - page four centered around a fairly moderate summary of the “somewhat depressing” Italian diplomatic situation.

&gt; We have spared sen. Tittoni, despite the tone of our previous articles – explained the main Roman correspondent of the *Popolo d'Italia*, G.P. (Gaetano Polverelli) – any preemptive attack […] in order not to increase the difficulties of a man who has accepted to deal with a troubling legacy because of his sense of duty […]   

&gt; In doing that, we can safely claim that we have been more observant towards Italy than those who, loyal to Sonnino and Orlando until the very end, attack, for partisan spirit, their successor. […] 


Tittoni, whose role and political initiative we discussed in extreme detail in previous weeks, had recently returned to Rome to address the Italian Chamber on the international matters and the activities of the Italian Delegation, as well as on the recent incidents occurring in Fiume during the first week of July, leading to the consequent establishment of an inter-Allied inquest committee. 

&gt; No one could blame us for creating a preemptive and dangerous atmosphere of mistrust around Tittoni – Polverelli continued, after stigmatizing the negative impact of internal disunion on the Italian negotiations – like we weren't responsible seven months ago [for the atmosphere created around] Orlando, with the damaging effects we all very well know. It is therefore necessary to resist the displays of mistrust, coming from certain supporters of Sonnino, who'd like to repeat the same mistake of Sonnino's past detractors. 

&gt; The situation in Fiume is not a new one since, much the opposite, it consists of the results of old mistakes. All our misfortunes, present an future, will be first and foremost the result of our internal divides […] 


&gt; We don't have much hope left – admitted Polverelli – and we'll only be able to diminish the effects of past wrongs. Nonetheless, it should be noted that the information published so far concerning the fate of Fiume is baseless, and our own official circles confirm that nothing has been decided yet. […] 


The best chance for the Italian negotiations was to persuade the Allies, and especially the French, who were already showing early signs of concern, of the long term repercussions that the matter of Fiume could produce on the Italian people. 

&gt; The serious and irreparable wrongs effected against Fiume […] would not be forgotten, even by our children, and there is no doubt that, once the young generation enters adulthood, many new things will have arisen from the ruins of Europe. Then Germany will be restored in its strength, and those who are too quick to forget Italy's generosity will have a chance to regret belittling our rights and snuffing out our affection. […]  


For the time being, Tittoni was going back to Paris as representative of a Ministry which had “abandoned the anachronistic observance of the Triple, in order to consolidate the new alliance” - something which the Allied had better take into consideration. 

A brief review of international matters followed, dedicating special attention for those of closer interest: notably, the situation in Smyrna, where the Greeks – able to get the better of Orlando during his vacancy from Paris – had encountered “unforeseen difficulties”. 

&gt; Large Turkish formations have recently decimated and pushed back the Greek army, which, after all, has practiced with the anabasis since the times of Xenophon. 

&gt; The Ellenophile press, a quite florid sector, says nothing any more of enthusiastic welcomes and Venizelos had, matters of fact, to ask for the Allied help in defining occupation zones and preventing the Ottomans from crossing over. The Conference sent the English general Allemby [sic] to Smyrna […] and the Greeks are, for the time being, under his supervision as inter-Allied representative. 

&gt; Yet, despite all that, Smyrne remains in Italy's history as the legacy of a Treaty signed in San Giovanni di Moriana and torn apart in Paris, in observance of the German custom. […] 


Additional details were, as customary, provided in smaller “press agencies” from Paris (the *Popolo d'Italia* had also deemed worth equipping themselves with a “special correspondent” from Paris, but, no matter how distinguished his intellectual profile, one can't really regard Giuseppe Ungaretti's pieces as especially insightful): from the designation of Tittoni for the supervision of the Bulgarian Treaty, to the installation of an inquest committee for the events in Smyrna, to the “struggle of the Croats against the Serbs”, with the former “firmly hostile to the union with the Serbians, unless the union assumes a republican form” and therefore “threatening a revolt”. Meanwhile, the Yugoslavs were “instructed to withdraw from Klagenfurth”. 

The following day – July 24^th – a detailed report, from an unspecified “popular newspaper from Salzburg”, illustrated the “Yugoslav methods” adopted in the regions subject to plebiscite which had been under their temporary occupation.  


And, on a similar note, on the 24^th page four was dedicated to “the international political moment”. 

&gt; […] the once great Hapsburg Empire – explained again Polverelli – has been reduced to a misshapen, overly mutilated, diminutive country, thanks to that congress of Paris which was supposed to rectify the manifold injuries and instead ended up committing new ones, no less egregious and certainly wider. 

&gt; Renner, president of the most afflicted Austrian republic has good cause for complaining, but what he won't ever be able to explain to his fellow Viennese citizens, is how the Yugoslavs, after fighting the whole war on their side and against the Entente, have ended up in Saint Germain judging the Austrians, their own comrades in arms until eight months ago, from the Allied seats. […] Why aren't the citizens of Vienna who declared the decadence of the Monarchy treated the same as the unruly inhabitants of Zagreb? […] 


Wilson and the Allied Nations – continued Polverelli – had not displayed the same “exaggerate affection” for the Austrian nationals left outside of the borders of the new state, “split among Czechs, Polish and Yugoslavs with methods which call back to the Congress of Vienna”.

&gt; But no one of the Entente stood up to effectively defend those six million Austrians who are men as well, and certainly more advanced than the Yugoslavs, and only our own socialists proved eager to listen to the appeal of those 200,000 Tyrolese who descended from the German lands across the Alps to settle themselves in a Latin land. […] 


Equally absurd, according to Polverelli, was the fact that, except for “a dubious Hungarian contribution”, the Austrian republic was left alone to face the “enormous war debt”. 

&gt; Also illogical. The Congress introduced the principle that liberated nationalities should pay an indemnity for their liberation, but set the total amount to one and a half billions [of Lire]. Italy, which liberated all the nationalities subject to the Hapsburg, was spending about one and a half billions each month of war. […] 

&gt; For now, the compensations for Italy are limited to the loss of Fiume and to the acquisition of scrolls and paintings, to the great satisfaction of our scholars and antiquaries, but not so much for our Treasury and tax payers. […] 


&gt; Last, we should note that Austrians are forbidden from joining Germany, but, after demobilization, whose bayonets are going to enforce this diplomatic deliberation opposed to the principle of nationality?

Se eu “dizer” que só podemos ter uma economia forte garantindo um investimento prévio na capacitação dos trabalhadores e garantia de condições de trabalho dignas teremos direitistas. 

Dito isto, aos fatos:

&gt; Eles querem o bem de todos e não querem que isso seja atrelado a nenhum “porém”. Se eu dizer que só podemos oferecer saúde e educação de graça com uma economia forte eles vão ficar revoltados, mas é a verdade.

Primeiro. Quem são eles? A “esquerda”?

Quem?

Os stalinistas? Os trotskistas? Os social democratas? Os sindicalistas? Os anarquistas? Os nacional-desenvolvimentistas? 

A discordância não é sobre ter ou não uma economia forte. Ninguém que não seja um completo retardado sabe que precisamos de uma economia forte para oferecer saúde e educação de forma plena. 

A discordância é sobre: 

- Preterizar quase que completamente aspectos sociais que afetam a absoluta maioria em virtude do lucro de uma minoria.

E o mais importante: 

- **Como desenvolver uma economia forte**.

Porque, e se prepare para ter sua mente explodida:


Não existe fórmula mágica para o sucesso econômico. 


Vários países deram certo de várias maneiras diferentes em vários contextos diferentes. Os nórdicos se deram super bem com estatização em massa e direcionamento econômico liderado pelo Estado. Praticamente toda a Europa Ocidental se ergueu com base no desenvolvimento da indústria nacional. Chile deu certo abrindo as pernas pra todo mundo, a China “deu certo” sendo uma ditadura social com economia planificada...Então começar um debate partindo do princípio de que você tem a solução para o desenvolvimento econômico do país é uma puta desonestidade. 

E é basicamente isso que resume o seu pensamento não é? Que você só quer deixar a economia do país forte enquanto a esquerda histérica quer direitos pra todo mundo? 

&gt; Então ser racional é coisa de centro. Ser burro é coisa de quem aponta pra um dos lados? Uau como você é iluminado

Ser o mais racional possível sim é coisa de centro, pois ser centrista “radical” como define o artigo da Wikipédia está pautado em buscar soluções viáveis em ambos os lados do espectro. Mas é algo utópico, uma meta a ser buscada. 

E não, ser burro não é coisa de quem aponta para um dos lados, invariavelmente todo mundo aponta para um lado porque todo mundo está inserido em seu próprio contexto. 

Ser burro é coisa de quem se recusa a dialogar com o “outro lado” em busca de soluções.

Maybe it's easier to think it's hard to start anew because it's scary.
Maybe your home, your foyer, is somewhere else actually.

I have traveled a bit in my life and when I get into a new counrty a new place I feel a fraction of what life would be like there and I feel like I would enjoy living there or not.
 
I live in France and LGBTQ life is not that hard in major cities compared to other places but when I got to Berlin I saw way more gay and lesbian couples holding hands in public. That made me realize that the atmosphere was more liberal there. I happen to meet with a guy that actually fled persecution and death threats from his country (eastern Europe don't remember which one but not LGBTQ friendly at all), settled in Germany and he told me that it was a hard but very good decision because it allowed him to live his life fully and that's priceless.

Also I think it's never too late to move even in your 50's because you can still experience life at it fullest.

It's never too late to live.

But I can't with simply talk with her how USSR was pure evil, because she was living at those times and i don't want to create her memory lane of only evil, I want for her to remember as much good memories as she can, so we avoid the topics of soviet era in our family.

Another point, while my mother was really strongly pro independance, not many people were brave enough at the time to be like that, now she is criticizizing current government and she is being labeled by some people as pro-communist, that is fucked up, some people are just ignorant, there were some good policies during USSR and ignoring that is suicidal, some people when see word communism they get triggered and ignore rationality.

&amp;#x200B;

My family faced oppressions and other atrocities, but we managed to save our culture, language and clear conscious and now seeing how people use these words of freedom and patriotism simply for profit and power is disgusting, for my mother it reminds her of soviet occupation times and their governing style.

Um Haroun is NOT the first Arab tv show/film to be widely publicized on national Arab television to discuss the perils of the Jewish communities across the Arab world. Secondly, the issues regarding the show Um Haroun is that it is extremely flawed and makes unsubstantiated claims. The Jewish communities of the Gulf did not 'raise arms in fear or attempts to revolt'. Many subtile issues with the show are the reason why Arabs and Muslims are in shock. There is one scene in which 'An Arab news broadcaster announces the creation of the state of Israel on the land of Israel' this line was written by a religious Zionist because the everyday Arab does not know the religious connotation of 'Land of Israel'. Another scene in which the image of Amin Al-Husseini is sold to send aid to Palestinians is absurd because among Palestinians the value of Husseini is meager. You don't see Palestinians naming their children or mosques or streets after him. Also, the show is not as you said 'about a woman who prepares to make aliyah' but is about a Jewish woman and a Jewish community that DID NOT want to leave Kuwait and felt compelled to do so after the creation of the State of Israel. So far on the show there are a few Zionists and the majority of the Jews do not harbor an interest in Israel. Most characters actually put a significant distance between themselves and Israel due to fear of losing their homes or being accused by the Kuwaiti authorities of being spies. 

My issue with a lot of Jews specifically foreigners outside of the Middle East is not bothering to understand why Arab states -unfortunately- were compelled to push out their Jewish citizens. When the state of Israel was declared it was declared as 'the state of all Jews, and all Jewish people are Israelis and have rights here even if they don't have a citizenship yet'. This itself placed the Jewish communities in limbo in their respective Arab homes. The Jews who identified as Zionist in the Arab states and were active, as well as Israel's identification as Jewish, forced Arab states to punish all Jews because Israel was considered an enemy state. Imagine living in France and saying you identify as belongning to ISIS who is an enemy ""state"" of France, you'd be screwed and your entire community would be put under surveillance to check who else poses the same threat! This was and is a massive mistake of the Arab states because they helped -secretly- push their Jewish community to Israel and thus ironically helped Israel to become larger and stronger, ironic considering Arab states claimed they wanted to weaken Israel. Another crucial point often missed is: You have to remember we are speaking about Arab states that were still under British and French rule and those actions happened with those Europeans full acknowledment. Does this not make you think that anti-semitisim was pushed on by the Brits and French on their Arab puppets to help Israel grow? Remember Israel never wanted Jewish Arabs because they were seen as backwards and only needed them ONLY AFTER the Holocaust and losing 6 million Ashkenazi Jews.

I applied under the foreigner student (non-EU) clauses in all cases, meaning I was exempted from presenting the respective PAU exams in Spain or their private education equivalents. I was made to present my diploma and transcript. The obligatory exams in one case consisted of an apparently simple but actually complex in-house exam for IE; in the other cases (Europea de Madrid, MIUC) I was made to take English and Spanish fluency exams (internet based, both seemed to be second language focused), and psychological analysis that was also internet based. Waited the time for results and ended up accepted at Europea and MIUC (Informatics Engineering / Business Analytics).

Second case was Portugal this year, former case was last year;
Applied for Sociology at ISCTE. Presented diploma and transcript, filled filed lengthy online form (no essay or that other nonsense y'all US colleges require except for like 2 paragraphs stating why you want to be accepted, just go over their website's ads and rephrase everything that applies to your course). Got accepted as well, no exams whatsoever but have to present physical diploma and transcript at one of their campus offices for internal equivalence.

The whole ordeal with the universities are usually super easy (usually more so for a foreigner than an European ironically), but you'll surely become almost suicidal when it comes to the clusterfuck that is authenticating documents at an embassy and getting a temp student Visa, also at the embassy.

Also do be VERY careful with what you pick as your degree as the European high school vastly differs from American;
A general rule of thumb for traditional degrees (engineering, classic humanities etc) is that the European students will start the degree from the get go with experience roughly equivalent to you having done the highest AP course in the degree's relevant areas by 12th grade.

Why havent countries reacted to the declaration of the Global health emergency on Jan 30? 
Waiting for a declaration of a pandemic (=when its everywhere) is like just waiting for the fire reaching your sleeping room instead of calling the FD when your neighbor informs you abt this suspicious smoke coming from you kitchen. Now blaming the neighbor for not banging your head with his fists in order to force you to call the FD seems a little bit childish.

Flights and Masks : Nobody needs to conform to WHO recommendations. East-Asian countries masked their citizens, the WHO didn't prevent them from doing that. Also stopping air travel would have been unnecessary. Just quarantining people would have been perfectly sufficient. Same with masks. Western politicians were singing the masks dont work song the same time the WHO did it. The WHO motivation was that they feared poorer countries wouldnt get masks for their HCW if richer countries would keep all their masks for their populations. Thats an understandable motivation of the WHO. 
Our govts just sang that song because they were unprepared and didnt want to admit it.
China fucked up until Dec 31. Basically the local Hubei authorities fucked up until they were overruled by officials from CCDC from Beijing. Same happened in Austria where ski-tourism wasn't halted by local officials, until central govt stepped in. China informed transparent from that date. That local lapse is not great. But if you see how its system generally works it was okay. I do not think that any western country would have reacted faster if it had the outbreak on their territory. In every pandemic politicians of all ideologies play it down by the means available to them because they have economic interests in mind until they see they have no other choice. US reacted when nursing homes exploded in Washington state. EU reacted when Italy and Spain had break-downs of their healthcare system. The simple fact is that politicians were too stupid to listen to the WHO.

He would tell you can't trust the German(tysken, I tilfælde at nogen kender en bedre oversættelse) with that being said he would have no issue crossing the border to Germany to buy coal and schnapps.

Then there's the fact that Germany took probably the richest and most developed 1/3 of the country in 1865, but we made an ungodly amount of money selling shit meat as gullasch to feed soldiers in the trenches during ww1 and they gave some of the land back in 1920 through a democratic vote.

I would say that generally for Danes Germany is the center of Europe and Europe is defined from that.
My guess is it also makes it easier to lump all former ussr controlled countries as one Slavic people, possible remnant from Soviet propaganda.

If you’re saying that just because they’re partly descended from Europeans makes them Europeans/white, then I have to bring up the fact that Europeans are partly Neanderthal. Does that make every white person a Neanderthal? 

The terms black, white, asian, and others that are used to determine race aren’t really that confusing. Someone descended from Europeans is white. Someone descended from Asians is Asian. Someone descended from Arabs are Arab and so on and so forth. It doesn’t matter if someone *looks* like another race, they are the race they are descended from. Sure there are pale Asians, but you wouldn’t discount their whole Asian heritage just because you think they’re white.

I use to apart of a very popular message board (that doesn’t exist anymore).  A “non-offending” pedophile” posted frequently.  He was adamant that he was no-offending but seemed quite proud of his pedophilia and would talk about it non-stop.  

Being a really dumb teenage girl, I was fascinated.  He had an obsession with dolls, various child actresses and in a worrisome twist, his 10-year-old little sisters best friend.  He’d post about his attraction and how’d he’d never offend but then go on and on about his “child modeling” collection which was basically legal soft core child pornography.  Eastern European and Brazilian little girls in swimsuits and undress posing extremely suggestively yet this was somehow legal?  He said it was harmless because these children enjoyed modeling.  In my adult mind, it’s obvious these children were being exploited by their parents and lived in countries with very lax laws around child pornography.  It was fascinating to engage with a self proclaimed pedophile and although he claimed he’d never touch a kid or hurt a child his line of what was and wasn’t ok was constantly stretched.  He was convinced relationships between a child and an adult was ok as long as the adult cared for and never hurt the child and things just got deeper and deeper.   I ended up stopping communication because I had my own life but last I heard he was arrested for “crossing boundaries” with his younger sisters friend.  

And before anyone jumps down my throat, he lived in a different country and I never knew his name so couldn’t do anything about it.  

It was just disturbing (and yes, fascinating) to see how his mind worked and see how there is a literally community of these men who think it’s totally ok.  Watching him slowly become ok with more and more exploitation of young girls was very disturbing.

&gt;	Coprinopsis atramentarius contains the mycotoxin coprine, which is a non-proteinogenic amino acid, like hypoglycin of the ackee.  But coprine isn’t the exact poison.  It’s what I’ve termed a propoison – a chemical that is converted to its active poisonous form through a normal metabolic process, like hydrolysis.  [This is my spin-off of a prodrug, which is common in the pharmaceutical world.]  In the body, coprine is hydrolyzed into the amino acid glutamic acid and the poison 1-aminocyclopropanol:

&gt;	Once formed, 1-aminocyclopropanol (or one of it’s cyclopropanone or cyclopropyliminium intermediates, I’ve seen multiple mechanisms – but if you’re not a geek, don’t worry about it) acts as an inhibitor of the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase (1).  This enzyme is important in the metabolism and removal of alcohol (ethanol) from your body.  Here’s how it works.  Alcohol is a wonderful poison that your body wants to get rid of, and is first metabolized by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase in the liver.  The byproduct of this is acetaldehyde, another poison that your body wants to expell.  This is accomplished by aldehyde dehydrogenase, again in the liver, with the end product being acetic acid.  Without aldehyde dehydrogenase, acetaldehyde accumulates in the body with disastrous results.

&gt;Have you ever been out drinking with a group of asians?  Ever seen some of their faces become blotchy and flushed?  This is because 30-50% of asians have a genetic mutation of ALDH2, the gene encoding aldehyde dehydrogenase, leading to an accumulation of acetaldehyde and the so-called “Asian flush syndrome.”   People of European and African decent rarely have this mutation.  Now we’re getting into genetics!

&gt;People afflicted by these mutations tend to have decreased incidences of alcoholism (2).  The mechanism behind this is more than likely negative reinforcement.  When people with two mutant copies of ALDH2 consume more than a few drinks, faces become flushed, they become nauseous, and experience tachycardia (fast heart rate).  It’s hard to become dependent upon something that makes you sick before you experience the good parts.  Maybe you’ve heard of drugs that help people stop drinking, like Antabuse.  Antabuse (disulfiram) works by inhibiting aldehyde dehydrogenase, and like coprine, makes the consumption of alcohol an unpleasant experience.  Coprine is just a natural version, albeit with a few caveats.

But apparently coprinellus micaceous does not contain coprine?

PNAS is usually a very good journal, but academy members get to basically submit one paper per year that just goes in regardless of peer-review. This is meant to foster discussion about controversial hypotheses, but it is also used by some of the members who become more fringe and less in touch with reality to promote their favorite conspiracies or bad hypotheses. See the Tyrone Hayes paper that Alex Jones summed up as ""making the frogs gay."" which wouldn't have been an issue but Tyrone Hayes refuses to actually release his data. He keeps claiming that everyone is attacking him but he has never published his fucking data. He has lived on conspiracy and media. 

&gt;But also there was the study, forget what it was called, where the rats fed GMO corn grew all kinds of tumors. I know that study was ""debunked"" by a EU-funded (read: big-ag lobby funded) study but...well exactly. I'll keep my skepticism high.

Oh you mean the lumpy rat torture that Seralini did? That was retracted for terrible methods and data massaging. If you believe the results of that study and you're male you should probably start taking moderate doses of glyphosate, their only statistically significant result was that male rats who consumed a moderate dose of glyphosate lived longer. No, this almost certainly isn't true or useful, it's just the only statistically significant point that came out of their garbage data. Once they tortured the rats sufficiently and then tortured the data to the last inch of its life, they came up with the lumpy rat paper. It got tons of media attention, then got RETRACTED which is usually a death sentence for a researcher that relies on public funding. Luckily for Seralini the money from homeopathy companies and organic interests flows like water. If you're worried that you might have glyphosate poisoning Seralini can recommend a magic water for that. https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2016/12/21/can-water-protect-glyphosate-poisoning-gilles-eric-seralinis-homeopathy-detox-hoax/

Hi everyone! Thank you for your interest and support for Austin R2. I’d like to provide an update for the schedule of what you can expect in the next few weeks. 

For those who missed the stream, please check out the VOD for the changes between R1 and R2. [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/608622670](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/608622670)

**Build streams**

Next week, we will have streamers 0siris from MechsOnDeck building a prototype on Tuesday (5/5), \~8PM CT on twitch. Be sure to check out the first build at [https://www.twitch.tv/mechsondeck](https://www.twitch.tv/mechsondeck).

On Friday of that week, we’ll also be having Quakemz from TopClack build the second prototype on Friday (5/8) on twitch as long as he receives the board on time. Check him out at [https://www.twitch.tv/topclack](https://www.twitch.tv/topclack)

I’ll try to be available during these streams but I can’t promise I’ll be around the entire stream. If you have any questions about the board, feel free to ask in the beginning or drop by the discord. [https://discord.gg/X6XhE6B](https://discord.gg/X6XhE6B)

**Polycarb Austin Auction**

To celebrate the start of R2, I will be auctioning a 1 of 1 production polycarbonate Austin based on the R1 design. The google form will open up on the 9th and will close Monday morning (whenever I wake up) on the 11th. This polycarb case is the only one of its kind since it was based on the production files from R1 and not the prototype. The case and weight will be sold “as-is” since there are no extras to replace it. I have not taken apart the case in order to reduce the risk of stripping the threaded holes and will provide additional fasteners if you choose to replace them. Invoice will be sent via Square and payment will be required within 24 hours. If payment is not made, the case will go to the next highest bidder.

US/CAN Buyers - US/CAN buyers will be able to purchase on [https://www.driftmechanics.com](https://www.driftmechanics.com/). These orders will only be available for US/CAN buyers and products will be available at 10AM CT on May 16th. There will be 75 units, FCFS. 

International Buyers - Anyone outside of the US will be able to purchase through ilumkb ([https://www.ilumkb.com](https://www.ilumkb.com/)). A product page will be available the day before and a google form will be in the description. GB starts at 3PM SGT on May 16th. Hopefully this time should work for those in EU and Asia. There will be 75 units, FCFS. 

For those who might not be able to join during the FCFS, there will be extras available after the GB units are delivered.

Due to the increase in the number of units for this round, the GB is expected to complete in 5-6 months. However, delays are always a possibility when it comes to GB so if there are any issues, please contact your respective vendor. 

Disclaimer on colors - Many of you have asked about the Charcoal gray. The chip that was provided to me doesn’t seem to match the prototype received by ilumkb so I will defer to his pictures for a more accurate color representation of the Charcoal gray. There is no guarantee that the production colors will be a 100% match to the prototype but should be very close. The manufacturer will generally match up to 90% of the pantone color and because anodization happens in batches, it is possible that not all grays or reds will turn out exactly the same. Please understand that there can be a lot of variances when it comes to which monitor you use to see the pictures or videos as well. The goal for the Charcoal gray is to be darker than the R1’s gray but not as dark as black.

They're way more likely to get searched and harassed and therefore arrested than whites. Of course they get arrested more when they're being scrutinized more. It might be much different in Europe.  In the US, only 15% of whites killed are by blacks but 82% of whites are killed by other white people. 90% of blacks killed are by other blacks.

What a game this is. I watched this recently for the first time and the whole thing is amazing. I've seen a lot of Palermo goals since watching this and that first goal is the most Palermo goal he's ever scored. He's so slow to get into the box to support Delgado (whose reaction to Geremi throwing the ball away is incredible) yet when he does get there he's perfectly positioned for the cross to miss Hierro, Casillas and Karanka and land straight onto his foot. 

And then Riquelme's pass for Palermo's second goal is utterly unbelievable. He takes one look up after controlling the ball and then delivers just the most incredible over the top pass I've seen from this era. Perfectly weighted and almost stops dead after it bounces so Geremi is unable to sweep it up. It bounces high and there's nothing he can do. Bounces a second time then Palermo scores. 

All in less than six minutes!

The rest of the game is so good as well, Riquelme's free kick that Casillas tips over after Riquelme mugs off Geremi with the Cruyff turn. Palermo nearly scoring a third off Delgado's cross. Makelele dribbling into the box. Riquelme almost scoring with another free kick at the start of the second half. Palermo almost scoring again from the corner straight afterwards. And obviously all the great chances Madrid had. 

Seriously one of the best games I've ever seen.

You're basically saying that since private companies have to answer to shareholders, the public sector can out perform it since it has much longer time horizons. 

1. There are plenty of massive corporations that are privately owned and don't have to answer to share holders like OtterBox, Patagonia, etc.
2. Even those that are publicly traded (Tesla, Uber, etc) often have very long time horizons. Now more than ever we've seen multibillion dollar companies operate at a loss for years.
3. If you're going to pose the example of ""If governments *have proper funding* they're more innovative"" you have to pose the same counterargument for the private sector. I'd bet that if the government had 100 billion to put towards more effect solar and a private company had the same 100 billion, the private company would produce it sooner and most likely better simply due to the fact that there's less yellow tape.

So an unknown number like I wrote. 

&gt;Because they relied on the models of people that were already way off with their predictions in previous instances (SARS/MERS etc) and have reduced expected US deaths (with lockdown in each case) from over 2 million to under 100k by now. Just lol, might as well have just blindly guessed. Also WHO got exposed hard as Chinese propagandists, they really shouldn't be relevant.

So the WHO shouldn't be relevant but I should accept your opinion as a reddit user. Most of their recommendations have reduced the curve of infected people in the countries where they were followed, without to my knowledge much backlash from other health experts not associated with it. The UK tried an alternative way and gave up not long later. 


&gt;Sweden didn't shut down their economy and their death counts per capita are lower than Spain/Italy/France/UK/Belgium and overall were middle of the pack for Western countries. And unlike the rest of the world they now have herd immunity going into next winter while the rest of the world can either stay locked down forever (untill a mass producable vaccine is found and administered) or reopen and accept that they gained virtually nothing (except countries with shit tier healthcare that actually got overwhelmed like Italy that had a fraction of the ICU beds per capita of e.g. Germany).

Sweden have done much worse compared to countries in the same region who applied lockdown measures. That's not really an argument. In regards to the comparison with Spain/Italy, it's a cultural reason, Swedish people have less physical contact than the people in those countries. 

We had the lowest UCI beds per capita rate in the EU and have done quite well after putting the lockdown measures in place. Ireland and the UK had similar rates and the Irish did better because they locked down earlier.

This also depends heavily on era. Repression was high in the Russian Civil War because it was chaos, they averaged 30k political executions a year during the war. After the civil war Lenin and the party let off a lot, this was more or less continued throughout the 20s before Stalin had consolidated his power. I believe in 1928 the Checka had a total of 30k political prisoners, and they were kept separate from criminal prisoners. The gulag system also did not exist at this time and the authorities were actually opposed to forced labor. It was a relatively freewheeling period in Soviet terms, they pulled back the repressive civil war policies that they realized would lead to rebellion if continued. The Party was still interested in reforms and there was a great deal of optimism, there was debate within the party and collective leadership, Party members were protected from execution for their opinions and so were more willing to speak out against the leadership and offer differing policies.

Then of course the late 20's gives into the Stalin era, as Stalin successfully purged all possible opposition, Trotsky in 1927, and then Bukharin in 1929. The repression early in the Stalin era were indeed mostly related to his ambitious policy of rapid industrialization. The first five year plan, for instance, called for reducing the share of the economy devoted to production of consumer goods from 80% to 50%, redirecting it instead to investment in industrial capacity. Naturally this would result in a dramatic drop in quality of life in that period, in return for long term gains. The first five year plan did have impressive economic results, producing double digit GDP growth *in the middle of the great depression*, with little to no foreign trade or investment. The Soviet Union actually had issues with *illegal immigration* later in the 30's from Finland and elsewhere in eastern Europe, unlike the capitalist countries there was work to do there, it's possible the Soviets wouldn't have won WWII without it. (Although it arguably set the course for the eventual stagnation of the Soviet economy; the rest of their history they neglected consumer goods, people had money but nothing to buy, and eventually they began missing out on important advances born out of consumer demand that occurred in the west, like the personal computer, because they were just obsessed with increasing steel and tractor production).

Now as part of preparing for the rapid industrialization, they decided to cut back on grain prices, to reduce the demand for consumer goods by ruralcels. But this lead to a massive shortage of grain - which it turned out eventually was the result of peasants hoarding grain hoping they could profit if price controls were lifted in the future. Bukharin was a lib, and was like hey we gotta raise those prices back up. Stalin was instead more or less furious, he considered it blackmail by the rich peasants, forcing the state to abandon its industrialization plans to line their own pockets. 

This was the source of the collectivization and dekulakization campaign more or less, the economy of scale of a combined farm would theoretically allow for economy of scale and greater production. But also it would allow the state to keep tighter control over the grain supply and make it difficult to withhold and hoard surplus. Wealthy peasants who were more likely to have a surplus and more likely to be withholding grain were especially the target, and of course this campaign involved a great deal of executions and stays in the gulag. Most of these would have been done outside of the justice system. 

There was also the general increase in harshness in other aspects of the five year plan, for instance, harsh penalties to wreckers or saboteurs who failed to meet targets. 

In the late 30's, Stalin had more or less totally centralized control over the party. This was more or less true by the early 30's honestly, with the expulsion of Bukharin from the Politburo. However in the early 30's Stalin was still maintaining the prohibition on execution of party members. He would basically just trot out his defeated political enemies from time to time and have them deliver humiliating speeches filled with contrition and praise for Stalin. 

By the late 30's he apparently tired of this, he was worried about potential upheavals after the great famine, and was paranoid about potential rivals to power existing, no matter how neutered they had been. So he instituted the great purge. First he tortured confessions out of his biggest political enemies he had grudges against from way back, like Zinoviev, and had them shot. Then he dug deeper and started shooting figures like Bukharin. Later on he more or less just started shooting every Old Bolshevik, even ones that had been more or less loyal to him weren't safe. Partially this was Stalin's paranoia about people with revolutionary cred being a danger to his power; but the newer members of the party were more than willing to play along, as it meant spots in the hierarchy would open up for them to fill.

This also came hand in hand with other waves of repression throughout the country. Minorities considered to be potential fifth columns, the intelligentsia, the military (this would be disastrous in the early stages of WWII), more kulaks, family members of purged party members, etc. They killed about half a million in all over two years.

In WWII and shortly after, Stalin moved a lot of ethnic minorities around. Usually somewhere in Siberia. In some cases a lot died during these transfers.

After WWII Stalin really didn't do much bad though, besides the 500k or so political prisoners at any one time. They even (somewhat strangely) abolished the death penalty for two years to celebrate the victory in WWII. 

With Kruschev political prisoners were massively reduced and this was more or less the case throughout the rest of the Soviet Union's existence, there was some uptick with Brezhnev but Brezhnev was no Stalin. The 80's in the Soviet Union of course was much freer and the late 80's was the wild wild west, they more or less let off of all censorship, by 1988 all political prisoners had been released. For this they rewarded by being gutted, destroyed, and looted by the United States throughout the 90s. The United States, more or less, took the Soviet and Russian liberalization as an opportunity to go buck wild and spend a decade just nonstop anally raping it's foolish enemy that thought we could all get along.

You can read about it else where, but the TL;DR is that as part of the Belt and Road initiative which aims to connect China with Europe and Russia, the Chinese have been imprisoning and ""re-educating"" The locals to adhere to the CCP policies through the use of concentration camps, forced labor, and encouraging colonization by others from outside to try and force cultural change. There have been rumors of forced sterilization, organ harvesting, and human rights violation. All of this is written off as being to combat terrorism, but there are 0 documented cases of extremism from the Uyghur people, nor are there any known ideological groups pushing a terrorist agenda. (so much for making this short but this is a complex geopolitical issue)
The problem with your view IMO, is that just because society decides something is normal doesn't make it right. The CCP is notoriously authoritarian so they can force their views onto the people to manufacture consent through state control of the media. The problem is that the public's opinion can be swayed with the right tools, something that in the west we have the privilege of not worrying about as much. In authoritarian nations, the leaders are the law.

Here's a relevant report about Arabian slavery. In 1811, Thomas Smee, the commander of the British research ship *Ternate*, visited a slave market in Zanzibar and reported the following:

&gt;'The show' commences about four o'clock in the afternoon. The slaves, set off to the best advantage by having their skins cleaned and burnished with cocoa-nut oil, their faces painted with red and white stripes and the hands, noses, ears and feet ornamented with a profusion of bracelets of gold and silver and jewels, are ranged in a line, commencing with the youngest, and increasing to the rear according to their size and age. At the head of this file, which is composed of all sexes and **ages from 6 to 60**, walks the person who owns them; behind and at each side, two or three of his domestic slaves, armed with swords and spears, serve as guard.
&gt;
&gt;Thus ordered the procession begins, and passes through the market-place and the principle streets... when any of them strikes a spectator's fancy the line immediately stops, and **a process of examination ensues, which, for minuteness, is unequalled in any cattle market in Europe**. The intending purchaser having ascertained there is no defect in the faculties of speech, hearing, etc., that there is no disease present, next proceeds to examine the person; **the mouth and the teeth are first inspected and afterwards every part of the body in succession**, not even excepting the breasts, etc., of the girls, many of whom I have seen handled in the most indecent manner in the public market by their purchasers; indeed there is every reasons to believe that the slave-dealers almost universally force the young girls to submit to their lust previous to their being disposed of. From such scenes one turns away with pity and indignation. [Wikipedia: Arab Slave Trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_slave_trade#Slave_markets_and_fairs)

Am auzit totusi de Marketing ca vin studentii mai mult ca profii. La licenta cel putin, sper la master sa nu fie asa ca acolo ma gandeam sa aplic (cum anume inca nu stiu, a avut guvernu’ chinez grija de asta). Cam asa e la multe facultati din ce aud, desi la unele chiar se face treaba. 

Cand auzi ASE, de obicei auzi Cibernetica, REI, si mai era una parca dar imi scapa. De astea de top nu prea stiu mare lucru, nu stiu nici cat se axeaza pe ce te intereseaza. Cibernetica duhneste a statistica si econometrie la prima impresie, materii scrise sus-sus de tot pe biletul meu de adio. 

Ce ti as recomanda din ASE, tried and tested gen :)) e FABIZ, care gen te invata de toate (administrarea afacerilor in engleza/franceza/germana) si treci si prin notiuni de vanzari si marketing dar doar doua semestre de marketing, in anu 1 si 3. Mai sunt si materii panarama, dar unde nu-s?

Personal as zice ca daca te tii DOAR de facultatea asta (FABIZ) si nu te duci tu la evenimente sau chestii extra, axate pe un domeniu, ai sa iesi din ea la modu “stiu asa putin din toate dar concret nu excelez in nimic”. Posibil sa fie asa la mare parte din facultati tho chiar nu stiu. 

Eu de exemplu m am tot dus cand au fost chestii pe marketing, asta e avantaju, ca se organizeaza incontinuu chestii, deci doar daca nu le bagi in seama, ca altfel te canalizezi sigur undeva, dar asta repet tine de tine mai mult decat de facultate. Ei sunt asa ca o rampa de lansare.

Most definetly, this sub is one of the closest I've found to being an aggregate of all ideologies and political subjects, along with r/moderatepolitics , which truly makes me happy. However, if we can improve it, then what is there to lose

&gt; the GOP party line and/or alt-right talking points.

Like the Bernie community is horribly miss represented online by people like Kulinski, the conservative community definetly has the same problems because of neo-nazi talking points and people like Crowder identifying as such. Although they feel they belong in a conservative mindset, a part doesn't represent the whole. Alot of conservatives have very sound arguments for problems that need fixing like healthcare and are usually extremely favorable to accepting ideologies that you would expect democrats to propose, all the while not being nazis when explaining their thought process.

&gt;Environmental policy.

One of the things that I love about debating is the possibility to introduce things you've never heard nor seen. I'm a sound believer that given your personal experiences and what you personally have seen, heard and felt will ultimately determine how you vote for it will best represent your interest, hearing people have opposing takes to yours while facing a similar situation is extremely learning. Personally, while leaning conservative, I've always supported a type of socialized healthcare. This is coming from an European who has experienced this healthcare firsthand. It might not be the best, but it was thanks to it that I got a small bill to pay and my life saved. If I was american and it meant paying higher taxes to enjoy such benefits, then sign me up. Despite this, when it comes to things like immigration, I definetly lean towards the conservative side.

With this, I would love to hear more debate on conservative v socialist or liberal policies to see the takes, experiences and benefits people think or know would happen.

It was always bittersweet - waking up in the body of a 20-year-old. I reached up to my face, wiped away the wrinkles that had rested below my eyes just yesterday. How many times would I die just to wake up to the slow drip of condensation falling from the damp walls? How many lives could I live before I found true lasting happiness that would be more than just another memory?

With a sigh, I picked myself up. With slow, careful steps I navigated my way to the entrance of the cave. Sunlight was beginning to warm the air, with nothing but trees to feast my eyes on. I thought back to the first time I dreamt of fire, then woke up in the middle of nowhere. It had been terrifying! I almost wished for the feeling of terror, just to feel something. 

I shook myself, shook off my melancholy. 

Excitement had filled me not long after the terror. Once I’d found my way to a town nearby, and realised I’d somehow transported myself to a small town in Washington. North America! I’d never even left Europe before! I’d been so blown away by the moment I’d forgotten my terror. But 50 years later I’d woken from a night of towering infernos in my dreams; back in a cold, damp cave with nothing to show for the years of love and laughter I’d left behind. None of the grey in my hair, none of the broken bones or aches to haunt me. Only the aches in my heart remained. 

I started the trek down from the cave with the sure step of a foot on a well walked path. My hands brushed the leaves of trees I’d passed so many time before. Would it ever get easier? Would I ever forget the lives I lived before? It wasn’t till the second or third time I’d woken in the cave that I started to think maybe I’d lost my mind. I probably should have considered that the first time, but to be young and carefree and full of joy was so distracting, so full of hope. When I started to realise how much time was passing, how many people I had lost, the sparkle started to wear off. The hope slowly faded to nothing. I started to lose touch with reality, but what was reality? I’m not sure even I’m real anymore.

The trees are behind me now. If I turned around I doubt I could see the cave past the towering landscape I’ve crossed. I can feel it, behind me, always. I take a pause, just breathing. Wondering what this new life will turn out to be, which people I’ll meet along the way.

I’m a Phoenix burning late into the night. I’m the Phoenix rising from the ashes. Feeding off my own energy, absorbing my own life source. I am, who I am.

Good thing there was a white supremacist right-wing fascist state waiting to receive them with open arms and a warm welcome, huh? 

Poor, innocent ""Europeans"" get to flee from the ""oppression"" of their own kind to white supremacist nations where they are readily allowed to seamlessly assimilate into the local white hegemonic population (because they're white, so of course you're ""the good immigrants"" that the likes of Trump want more of) and proceed to become red-baiting ""evils of communism!!!"" conservative propagandists (i.e. you) that will go on to disparage, discriminate, tokenize and marginalize non-white minorities in America.

&gt;  Just so we’re clear kidnapping wasn’t just done by white man. I’ve had members of my own family kidnapped by the Shawnee 

""*Just so we're clear my personal, single anecdote about my (alleged) family member being kidnapped by members of a single Native nation is the exact sociocultural and political equivalent of the systematic, generational project of kidnapping and brainwashing of Native children from several different Native nations by the white settler-colonial establishment*""

The level of mental gymnastics you white supremacist apologists will do to convince yourselves that ""wHiTeS aRe opPrEsSeD tOo!!"" is absolutely incredible.

Let me guess, you're one of those whites who brings up ""Irish slaves"" when discussing the issue of American chattel slavery with black people?

&gt;  I don’t hate you

Judging from the way you talk to people on this board, you're one of those whites that ""doesn't hate minorities"" as long as they ""know their place"", i.e. as long as they don't challenge you or otherwise act like they're your equal, or like whites aren't the protagonists of reality. Tell you what: feel absolutely free to hate me or Indigenous people in general. I'd actually prefer you to go all the way and just be an out-and-proud bigot than have you keep invading Native (or any POC) spaces just to do this tired White moderate ""wokescolding"" routine where you try to talk down to them and tell them how they need to cater to whites and how whites are victims just like them because ""*one time brown people kidnapped your (alleged) family member*"".

&gt; Truthfully “White man” has done more atrocities to himself than any other race. 

...Okay? So ""White man"" has ""done more atrocities"" \[sic\] to himself than any other race has done to them, and they've also ""done more atrocities"" to just about every other race they've ever been in contact with than those races have done to themselves.

Sounds like we know who the problem is?

&gt;  Another reason to consider myself an American, my grandfather 9 generations back was Timothy Matlack. You know, the penman of the Declaration of Independence. 

...Ok? You keep name-dropping these white colonizers like I give a shit. I don't care if Thomas Jefferson was your great-great grand-uncle or if George Washington was your mother's aunt's father's cousin twice removed. None of those white colonizers that signed the DeClArAtIoN oF InDePEndEnCe you're so proud of gave a single fuck about the ""inalienable rights"" to ""life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness"" of the American Indigenous people they genocided or the Black people they enslaved and forced to build their country for them. What do I care which of them you're related to? 

All you really accomplished by saying this was further prove my point that ""being American"" is more about race than it is about law.

&gt; You’re coming across as a Nazi and a racist by the way. 

What a coincidence, I was just thinking the same thing about you. All your talking-points are regurgitated, lightly sanitized alt-right white supremacist ""whites are victims too!"" narratives that are spouted by far-right fascist icons like Richard Spencer, Stefan Molyneux, Sargon of Akkad, Paul Joseph Watson, etc.

Not really, it's definitively how Lucas saw it, and it's the condition by which he consented to it. And Lucas was the boss, it was his IP and his universe. It's been described exactl


&gt;nonetheless he does say ""That said, unless something occurs in a canon project to directly contradict a published source, it can be said to have reliably occurred"". 

Yes, occurred in that EU parallel universe.

&gt;Actually there was a canon tier system created by Leland Chee the creator of the Holocron that categorized Star Wars canon back then before April 25, 2014 as a whole

By the Licencing division of Lucasfilm, whose job it was to create and maintain the Expanded Universe project with third party companies like Del Rey and Dark Horse. LFL Licencing had their canon, an alternate universe where their things ""happened"", but it quite clearly wasn't George's prime universe. That alternate universe hasn't ceased to exist. When LFL said they were rebranding it, they didn't say it's no longer canon. They said it was never part of George's canon. It has not been ""de-canonised"".

You really didn't need the essay. I've seen all the quotes. I didn't need the EU canon explained to me. I lived that world for 20+ years. Both Lucas and LFL Licencing acknowledge that the EU was a parallel universe to George's. George very explicitly said that the EU did not happen in his universe.,

&gt;I own Star Wars: The Ultimate Visual Guide and Star Wars: The Essential Readers' Companion the timelines/stories cited almost all of it is from the Expanded Universe (EU) and treated as if it were canon on the same level as G-canon

This is what Roffman said in 2017: ""*We were pretty religious about doing that, our biggest problem was a guy named George Lucas, because he didn't buy into the spin off fiction and the game program and all the 'alternate universe' we were creating. We wanted it to be one universe, we felt strongly that that's what it needed to be, but George as the filmmaker didn't want to be beholden to somebody else's creative vision.*""

Sim, faz total sentido, acho que acabei criando expectativa demais que as coisas iriam simplesmente fluir, acho que conheço muitas pessoas que parece que depois de se formar no curso que gostam as coisas simplesmente vão acontecendo e achei que seria igual, porém tenho certeza que por trás dos resultados que vejo elas com certeza em sua maioria quebram muito a cabeça pra fazer aquilo dar certo

 

*A falta de cliente de clientes é um dos problema no trabalho de consultório?*

Sim, e ai junta um monte de coisa, pra conseguir clientes preciso me expor, então precisaria criar um canal no youtube, insta, qualquer coisa, me oferecer pra fazer palestras em academias ou coisas parecidas, o problema é que eu nunca confio 100% no meu conhecimento e dele valer algo, é até engraçado pois quando me comparo com outros nutris vejo que muitos tem muito menos conteúdo a acrescentar e se dão bem, eu não sei vender meu peixe, o fato disso envolver pessoas me parece mais desgastante ainda. Acho até que isso deve ter sido alguma aversão criada pois lembro que antigamente eu na 3-4 série fiz mais de 50 reais vendendo e trocando tazos pro pessoal da escola, minha mãe descobriu e tive que devolver tudo, quem sabe criei uma aversão a isso de vendas começando por ai? Só jogando um pensamento pro alto mesmo

&amp;#x200B;

 

*A ciência que você comenta é muito teórica e pouco prática?*

Não necessariamente mas eu sinto muito medo de ser um nutricionista ''basicão'' que baseia suas condutas no achismo e não em artigos e teorias, eu não to ali brincando, se você faz algo errado com alguém que tenha algum problema mais sério essa pessoa pode morrer, então pra isso eu preciso me acabar de estudar, eu sinto que é errado colocar laranja no planejamento de um paciente pois a laranja tem vitamina C que vai ajudar em diversos fatores por ser antioxidante, que fatores? Vai ajudar no que? Como? Qual a via e como funciona cada parte? Eu sinto que eu preciso dominar tudo pra passar as coisas senão pra mim parece uma conduta raza ( e eu não acho que seja perfeccionista, me acho bem longe disso haha, é só um medo gigante de estragar tudo )

 **Pode ser existe outro tipo de abordagem, de trabalho que você tenha mais afinidade.** Você já parou para pesquisar sobre outras formas de abordagem, como a ***nutrição comportamental?*** 

Não sei se chegou a ler mas nos outros posts disse que pretendia fazer uma outra pós ou mestrado, então eu pensei muito em fazer um sobre nutrição comportamental, eu acho isso MUITO legal e é bem a linha de pensamento que eu gosto, não ver um corpo a ser curado mas sim uma pessoa com medos, problemas, felicidades, com uma família, eu considero seriamente tentar algo em um postinho de saúde, algo pra trabalhar mais com saúde preventiva, como uma unidade básica de saúde da família, meu período de estágio em um desses lugares foi muito legal e eu me sentia bem la, mas por enquanto está no pensamento

&amp;#x200B;

 

Para você sentar e focar, é preciso saber para onde você quer ir, com clareza e segurança.

Se sua vontade é fazer algo é abalada, isso pode afetar o seu foco.

É importante encarar isso não como algo ruim, mas como um sinal para que você faça escolhas mais sábias, mais certeiras.

Isso sempre foi um problema pra mim, eu sempre fui bastante inseguro em milhares de coisas na minha vida, a escolha do meu curso acho que foi a única coisa que eu nunca questionei, ou nunca tinha questionado até agora

&amp;#x200B;

 

*Se dinheiro não fosse problema, o que você estaria fazendo?*

Provavelmente coçando o saco a vida inteira e atendendo nutricionalmente 1-2 dias da semana em algum lugar pessoas que não tivessem dinheiro pra pagar por um nutricionista, penso até quem sabe pequenos atletas já que minha pós é em esportiva, ai você pensa, nossa legal então é isso que ele se sente bem, mais ou menos... Eu atenderia muito mais tranquilo sabendo que a pessoa não está pagando, pois com certeza é melhor uma ajuda de graça do que uma paga que deixa a desejar (de novo, inseguro do meu trabalho). Não me levem a mal, sempre quis ter muito dinheiro mas nunca pra ter vidão ou carros e essas coisas, não ligo pra carros, marca de roupa, nem comida cara e acho ridiculo ser 30-40 reais um prato de comida em um restaurante desses razoavelmente legais. Eu só queria ter muito dinheiro pra deixar rendendo e viver de renda passiva sem ter que trabalhar, poder ajudar com a nutrição umas vezes na semana pois acho que é justamente nas pessoas que nao tem condições de pagar um atendimento assim que a gente consegue ter um impacto maior, conheço pessoas que se tivessem tido uma nutrição melhor quando mais novas poderiam ter evitado tantos problemas e outras que teriam tido tantas boas oportunidades em esportes..

&amp;#x200B;

Sobre as perguntas finais estou refletindo sobre elas, cheguei a alguns pensamentos refletindo hoje de madrugada, vou manter a ideia de dar aulas na mente, enquanto isso, comprei um curso bem baratinho e mais basico sobre assessoria e consultoria em alimentação e nutrição, basicamente eu iria nos estabelecimentos e daria um de vigilante sanitário, como consultor eu iria demarcar tudo que precisaria ser melhorado ou colocado nos conformes e como assessor iria aplicar tudo isso que foi observado ou por mim ou por outro consultor. Essa parte mais de ''produção'' sinceramente nunca me chamou a atenção pra falar a verdade, mas quem sabe se eu achar razoavel o assunto eu me sinta melhor trabalhando nisso e quem sabe mais pra frente poder ate dar aulas sobre isso pois sinceramente? Eu não me vejo tendo nenhum tipo de conhecimento especial(atualmente) que possa ensinar a alunos de faculdade que estão cursando nutrição, só um monte de coisas desconexas, nunca algo específico, o famoso jack of all trades and master of none.

Where are you based? I have a few US shops in mind below.

If you are looking for a shop for both pen and inks, the first shop that comes to mind is [Vanness Pens](https://vanness1938.com/). They have an excellent selection of inks and pens, and they've recently started a loyalty/points program where a certain number of money spent equates to points that are redeemable for a coupon (e.g. 5% off your next purchase). 

The next shop that I love if you are interested in a stationery store is [Yoseka Stationery](https://yosekastationery.com/). They don't always stock pens that I want, but they have an excellent assortment of paper, accessories, pens, and inks. And it all comes in the best packaging!! Every order is thoughtfully packaged, includes some stickers, and even a thoughtful note. The paper selection is definitely much better than Vanness (imo), which might be something your wife is interested in as certain qualities in ink can only show up in certain high quality paper. One caveat is I don't know if they really carry euro brands if your wife prefers European brands like Pineider.

Third, is a tie between Pen Chalet and Dromgoole's. They're based out of AZ and TX, I believe, so shipping time might be faster than Yoseka or Vanness (NY and AR, respectively I think). Pen Chalet almost always has 10% coupons and both usually have a great selection of used/vintage pens on sale as well.

Finally, I think Goulet Pens is a staple. However, they aren't currently shipping (the others are) so this may affect your wife's purchasing needs. They are definitely still worth a look!

UAE, and the other small gulf states have large European populations and are strong allies in the region wich rely on European trade and military support.

While Azerbaijan doesnt get on with Russia anymore much due to Armenia(russia supported them invading Azerbaijan) and georgia(wich russia broke up) and wants to sell gas to the eu wich means they're also a valuable partner and likely future ally in the region. Georgia meanwhile is desperate for somone to counter russia and firmly in Europe's sphere and may will join the eu in the future if its conflicts are resolved and Armenia meanwhile recently had a revolution wich will push them towards the EU.

Lebanons chatolic population meanwhile really likes france and theres a lot of trade between the two wich puts them pretty firmly Europe's sphere. Turkey despite the Cyprus dispute is firmly into he EUs sphere as over half of its trade is with europe and theres a large Turkish diaspora in europe. While there are some disputes Turkey can only ever go so far and is completely reliant on the eu for economic reasons. Meanwhile egypt and isreal is reliant on EU trade even if they're not in Europes sphere necessarily. And saudi arabia is a western puppet who relies on the u.s and france continue to exsist and wont piss of the eu as a result.

Generally speaking all the small or less religous/chatolic middle eastern countries plus turkey are in Europes sphere while the larger ones are outside it but still reliant on the EU and unwilling to go against it for fear of large scale economic fallout.
 As a result nearly entirety of the middle east with the exception of iran, and Syria is either a western ally or economically dependent on the eu.

&gt;The region is torn between Iran and the Saudis/Israel. Now also Turkey and even Russia, not much room left for the eu

Think about it this way theres a regional powers and then theres global powers. The u.s, china, russia, and EU are global powers Turkey, Israel, saudi Arabia and iran are regional powers. This means that for example turkey can be both in the eu sphere and have it's own sphere. Same goes for the Saudis with both the eu and US and isreal with America and Iran with Russia.

&gt;Also, I wouldn't call Russia an enemy of the eu, they clearly want France and Germany's permission to carve up former soviet republics, but not much else. If the Russians had the power, maybe they would go for more, but they don't and they know it.

Russia's goal is to expand there influence back into the old u.s.s.r and primarily eastern europe. The EU however will crush the russian economy with sanctions if they expand. And if Europe stays United against russia is screwed. As a result they've spent the last 10 years focusing on destroying the EU by founding far right populist groups in places like the Netherlands. And supporting authoritarian regimes in Hungary.

Use the guides here, they are very high in quality. Their principal flaw (IMHO) being that over the years there has been some thrash and churn in the standard expressions from various distilleries and so inevitably guides and references will get a bit out of date, referring in some case to bottles which are no longer to be found or which have escalated in price. But if you follow the discussions here in this sub you'll catch on pretty quick re: the current state of the industry, and you can always ask questions.

The Malt flavor Map is an especially useful resource (with the same limitations I just mentioned). Bourbon &amp; Rye don't have a graphical aid of similar descriptive power, IMHO. So my rec is to look over the map and think of it as a sort of landscape in need of exploration, plan to go next to spots on it which you haven't visited yet.

And when it comes to shopping, www.wine-searcher.com is your friend, use it to get a sense of what prices are like from place to place and where to find things you might want to purchase. 

If you go much deeper down the scotch rabbit hole, you'll see frequent reference in reviews to bottles which are not easily found in the USA and have to be sourced from overseas. Scotch is a bit different from bourbon in that it has a flourishing subindustry of independent bottlers or IB's (much like the NDP = non-distiller producers in bourbon) of which there are a very large number, and both individually &amp; collectively they put out an enormous volume of different releases, many of them single casks or otherwise with a very small bottle count. Keeping track of them all is a herculean task and rather than chasing after any 1 specific bottling I've found it more useful to get a sense for broader trends - single cask IB scotches are like a well run bus system - if you miss 1 bus, the next one will be along shortly.

And don't forget about world whisky, which gets discussed both here and in other subs, most particularly r/worldwhisky. Some great malts which flavor-wise are in many (but not all) cases very similar to scotch are being made in Ireland, India, East Asia,  Europe &amp; elsewhere - so don't miss out on exploring those too.

And if you are up for splurging on a book, I strongly rec Dave Broom's *The World Atlas of Whisky* as a first purchase, for reasons I can unpack in detail on request.

It started earlier than the 14th century, which I indicated in that first answer, but the numbers of Jews were so small that it's hard to know what their experiences were really like.

One thing that should be clear is that these kinds of charters weren't statements of equal rights or granted out of the goodness of their hearts or anything like that. (And it should be noted that saying ""we won't kidnap your kids"" should really not be considered that liberal....) This was a contract between the Jewish community and the ruler, in which Jews received these privileges in exchange for a tacit agreement that they would provide disproportionate economic benefit (mostly in the form of taxes) to Poland. This was an extremely common part of medieval Jewish life, in which Jews had little to no right to exist in any given place without the direct privilege, or permission, of a local ruler; this permission (generally with protection) was nearly always in return for the payment of massive taxes, and at any time the permission could be revoked.

In the sense of what the early charters- the first by Duke Boleslaw of Kalysz in 1264- included, they were not that different than those that came before from German kingdoms and duchies as far as their terms. In practice, though, Jews did better because they benefited Poland enough that Poland was motivated to keep to the terms of this charter, as long as the Jews kept up their side. It's also worth noting that, as with all other prior charters, Jews were not considered equal residents, but separate residents. They were considered legally autonomous from their surrounding Christian population and infrastructure and under the direct rule of the local ruler or the crown, as the case may be. (In western Europe, such as in England, this was taken as far as to consider Jews the property of the Crown.) It was this autonomy under these charters that had led, over the centuries, to the development of the kehillah, or the Jewish autonomous community which became a bedrock principle of Jewish life for centuries (and is still a factor today, though to a much more limited degree). One of the main focuses of the Jewish autonomous community's organizational system was a tax collecting system, due to the need to pay these taxes in order for Jews to be permitted to remain where they were and to receive any protections. In Poland, they were far less likely to be expelled than they had been in western Europe, but they knew that the goodwill that they enjoyed relied on their being able to contribute very concretely financially to their host country.

It also benefited Jews that they were only one of many minorities resident in Poland at that time, a place which comes as close as you could expect to anachronistically call any medieval place ""multicultural."" There were also only a few thousand of them, scattered throughout the area. Again, because these communities were so small, not all that much is known about them, but it is known that they did live relatively peacefully, though not completely free of antisemitism (living as they did in a place where the Catholic clergy had very specific views about Jews) and persecution. As far as other countries where Jews were given relatively liberal rights under charters, in Lithuania they were given a relatively similar charter a century later, in 1388-89.",True,False,False,,,0,1588475969,,1588476150,0,{},fpbq67z,False,t3_gbl4ay,False,False,t1_fp70rjw,/r/AskHistorians/comments/gbl4ay/medieval_poland_was_known_for_its_tolerance_of/fpbq67z/,False,,1594863175,9,True,False,AskHistorians,t5_2ssp3,r/AskHistorians,public,,0,[],

(TL/DR; translated recipe and link [in Hebrew] on the bottom of this post)

First off, I didn’t have a chance to upload a recipe as I posted this image right before Shabbat.

Second, let me assure you that it was DELICIOUS!! Especially with the fresh hummus I made 😋

Third, recipes for Kubaneh (or almost any Yemenit dish) are as varied as the many communities that lived there. Like In Europe, every community had their adaptations of popular recipes and their own costumes and dialects, same was true in Yemen. So no matter which of the many online recipes I post, or if I share my own, it will likely come under scrutiny for being unauthentic. So I might as well make it as I like, and own it, lol!

Four, the earliest mention of Kubaneh is believed to be in the Babylonian Talmud Tractate Berachot 37: “ טְרוֹקְנִין, חַיָּיבִין בַּחַלָּה. וְכִי אֲתָא רָבִין אָמַר רַבִּי יוֹחָנָן: טְרוֹקְנִין פְּטוּרִין מִן הַחַלָּה. מַאי טְרוֹקְנִין? אָמַר אַבָּיֵי: כּוּבָּא דְאַרְעָא.”
( Translation from Sefaria: Another issue concerned terokanin, with regard to which it was said that they are obligated in the mitzva to separate ḥalla, meaning that terokanin have the halakhic status of bread. And, when Ravin came from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Terokanin are exempt from the mitzva to separate ḥalla. The Gemara asks: What are terokanin? Abaye said: Terokanin are made of a watery mixture of flour and water roasted in a cavity in a stove in the ground and is not actually bread.)

The Aramaic term “Kuba De’Araa”(- referring to the watery dough mixture roasted in a cavity in a stove in the ground) is beloved to be the Origen of the term Kuba-neh, meaning our Kuba.

Therefore the bread name is actually a term referencing a type of dough mixture and it’s low and slow baking technique.

This still holds true today. (Almost) All Kubaneh recipes include a wet (sticky) dough mixture, and (at least in part) a low and slow cooking method [Ideally all night], in a thin, aluminum pot with a tight fitting lid.

As for the dough, a great Kubaneh uses at least a part whole wheat mixture, as it imparts a very rich and complex flavor (I had the same results using the spelt and rye, the flavor was complex and delicious). White flour is generally preferred in part for making the final bread lighter and fluffier. Mine was definitely on the dense and heavy side. The dough is made with a generous amount of clarified butter or oil. (I made mine with Olive oil) some add things like fired onion or seeds, delicious, but truly unnecessary.

I will include the recipe that I used below in the original format. You can play around with the flour mixture as long as you keep to the general technique and consistency. Please note, like Challah or Sourdough bread, this is one of many. Not necessarily the ultimate, just the most recent one I tried. [here’s the link for the Hebrew original ](https://mobile.mako.co.il/food-cooking_magazine/five_ingredients_recipes/Recipe-4797ce2feff1041006.htm) 


Ingredients	:

	1 Kilo flour (1/3 whole wheat 2/3 white flour) plus additional flour for dusting (*again I adapted this part to my preference, results obviously different from original, heavier and denser, but I preferred my flavor. Next time I may try to make it 1/4 rye 1/4 spelt 1/5 white for a more traditional lighter result)
	1 packet of dry yeast or 1 cube fresh yeast
	2/3 cup olive oil
	1 liter lukewarm water
	3 Tbsp Salt (I thought this was a bit much, perhaps 2 &amp; 1/2 would have sufficed)
	1 Tbsp Sugar

Instructions:

1 )
Mix flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in a big bowl. Add lukewarm water and mix well, it should result in a wet dough, but not liquidy. If The dough mixture feels too dry, add an additional half a cup of water

2 )
Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled (Between 1 to 2 hours).

3 )
Kneed the dough once more, cover and let rise again (about one hour) until doubled.

4 )
Pour the oil into the Kubaneh pot (this is an aluminum pot with a tight fitting lid that can be placed in the oven, I doubled this recipe and used 2 pots for this recipe. One had the tighter lid, the other one didn’t. The one that didn’t burnt and was almost unsalvageable. To fix this I’d recommend if you don’t have a tight fitting lid to use heavy duty tin foil to seal the pot and then cover as tightly as possible with lid) place the bowl with the dough mixture next to the pot. Next to this, place a deep plate with flour (preferably whole-wheat *though I was happy with spelt and rye). With wet hands tear out a ball of dough roughly the size of a large orange (I recommend having a bowl with water to keep your hands wet, so the sticky dough doesn’t eat you alive). Roll the dough and some flour and place in the pot with oil. Rinse and repeat. When done, there should be roughly 10 balls, they may be crowded and be one on top of the other, but that’s OK. (for fancier results you can flatten out the dough a bit and roll like a thick Jelly roll each chunk and then flour and place in pot to form a “flour”, though haven’t tried that with this recipe, so not sure about results, lmk if you try and if you have success)

5 )
Cover with lid (and heavy-duty tinfoil if necessary) and allow to rise for another hour. Meanwhile turn on the oven and set to 250°C/482°F and place oven shelf in the lowest level to fit pot in oven comfortably.

6 )
Bake on high for one hour (yes this is scary and it may smell smoky, but yes, one hour. *actually, I believe, for my adaptation, 45 minutes would have sufficed). After an hour lower the oven to 100°C/212°F and bake for at least four more hours, but preferably overnight. 

7 )
This step is unnecessary but helps: Two hours before serving remove the lid, increase the heat to 170°C/338°F and bake for another hour uncovered. Turn the Kubaneh upside down and return to the pot (carefully, don’t let it fall apart) and bake for another hour with the darker side facing up on 170°C/338°F. (*gauge your bread before going for this step, if it’s looking already somewhat dark, skip or reduce the time for this step as necessary)

8 )
Serve with spicy tomato dip, fresh or cooked. Sahug (various hot pepper dip/paste), Green Tahini, and for those who would like to do this properly: Hilbeh/Hilbah (fenugreek dip).

*Please note, this is an oily bread. When you take the bread out of the pot, I recommend placing on a clean old towel on top of a cutting board or in a container to soak up some of the excess oil before serving, or if serving immediately directly onto plate, to avoid any mess or staining.",True,False,False,,,0,1588478302,,1588482859,0,{},fpbth67,True,t3_gbsmta,False,True,t3_gbsmta,/r/Judaism/comments/gbsmta/this_rustic_yemenijewish_bread_was_a_staple_for/fpbth67/,False,,1594864745,2,True,False,Judaism,t5_2qi67,r/Judaism,public,,0,[],

Not only that compare europe, scandinavia, and some other asian countries to USA. They have far more progressive social programs and programs to help people. We are the richest nation in the history of mankind.

and you're telling me that we should just accept it? When is it a good time to fight? Never? A good passive farm animal i should be? No thank you. They had all the money, knowledge and resources in the world to evolve our economy along with the constant boom in technology.

&amp;#x200B;

I bet you thought our military could handle the middle east terrorist organizations without realizing that our government can't do any such thing because it can't even solve gang or hate groups at fucking home. How are you gonna go across the world into a foreign culture and people, and expect to solve the problem? How can you not see through this and think like a farm animal?

I'm sorry man, no way in hell will i become passive and not resist against people who constantly push against our own interest and only aim to achieve their own IN A SOCIETY! If government or billionaire coporations aren't  really willing to do anything with all the accumilated money that has been pumped in than this entire system needs to die even if it costs many american lives. Because in the long run how we are running thing, no humans will exists and future generations will see suicide and terrorism as the only way to exercise their being... Either you resist completely or you stand up and fight, make it known to the uber rich elite that we know what they are doing and we don't like it.

&amp;#x200B;

If we all followed what you suggested then when do you recommend we start fighting back? When start implanting chips into us to track us? When working and living conditions kills off millions all in one go (because apparently, not letting people die in masses is more acceptable and less concerning).

&amp;#x200B;

So you suggest we fight once every child has a purchase tag over their head because they are now enslaved to the system which was forged to act exactly in that way? Just follow their game until they bring us off a cliff? Nah, if i did that than i would lose all rights to complain about crime, poverty, war, and corruption if i was complacent and willing. I'm not, nor will i ever think like a goddamn centrist.

Ok, so you're defining religion as some narrow and miniscule facet of human belief. I'm speaking from the more broad and standard idea that many aspects of religion have been assumed to explain our reality or reason for existence in a very literal sense.

I didn't say that not understanding germ theory WAS religion, I said that the absence of that knowledge allowed an easier acceptance of an alternate religious explanation. This isn't conjecture, just read the old writings by all of those wise people who asserted demons or evil spirits brought on the sweating sickness or the plague. 

As for European polytheism, what was believed as literal or metaphorical is a bit besides the point now. My original post was that actual knowledge shrinks the gaps wherewithin spiritual or religious concepts can find a reason for existence.

In regards to the literalism of a creation myth, what does this mean for a religion that views such as merely allegorical, as you claim? It is probable that many of these stories were told as alagories, but doesn't mean there wasn't a purpose behind them. They exist(ed) to explain the unknown, to give us guidence and aid us in survival as as social groups and as a species.

1. London is an amazing city to live in, there as so many experiences and opportunities at all times. In addition there are a lot of businesses that regularly go to the universities looking to offer internships, so getting one should not be too hard. But it is very expensive city to live in. (although I’m not sure how it compares to Switzerland). 

2. LSE has an amazing campus right in the center of London. 

3. If you have a European passport getting into the UK at the moment is very easy and once you are here you can apply to the “EU Settlement Scheme” which allows you to remain here for the next 5 years, the application is VERY easy. 

4. The internship opportunities I mentioned above might be diminished by the COVID situation. 

5. London being London would be one the cities hardest hit by a second COVID wave, so there are higher chances that the university resorts to online teaching at some point.

Calculus covers differential, integral, and vector techniques, but it's mostly rote learning, and is designed with engineers and other disciplines where they want to know the machinery without the why behind it. But calculus is a bastardization of analysis, which is the proofs side of calculus. Their bread and hummus are real and complex analysis, and then they branch off into measure theory, probability theory, and ODEs and PDEs.

And that's not to say that calculus isn't hard. There's a lot of information you have to retain, and unless you find the material interesting, it'll feel like a slog.

An example of the difference: In real analysis, you'd be asked to prove that the sum from n = 1 to infinity of 1/n diverges, whereas in calculus you'd likely just be told that it does.",True,False,False,,,0,1588481117,,False,0,{},fpbx857,False,t3_gaoo80,False,True,t1_fpbwbd4,/r/SubredditDrama/comments/gaoo80/rrutgers_has_small_civil_war_when_126_students/fpbx857/,False,,1594866530,3,True,False,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,r/SubredditDrama,public,,0,[],

&gt;Its shameful that we cant find a viable substitute

So whose fault is that? Secondly, all those other countries have an overwhelming majority of speakers of one language. You should compare us with Switzerland or the EU.

&gt;Modi and Shah didnt partition Andhra, Congress did

The BJP supported the partition. Secondly, what did the BJP do when it came to power? nothing. Even when it had all the power to do something.

&gt;Do you think money will come out of Thin air, 

Money seems to come out of thing air when it comes to feeding the northern states. Actually, they come from states like Andhra.

&gt;Dont start with We contributed this much and only asking for fair share.

And why not? We are asking for a fair share. What do you mean don't start? 

&gt;I am sorry, world is fucked up but It didnt fuck itself yesterday.

I'll use this response for later. You don't deserve my respect you filthy BIMARU maggot. You got offended? Sorry. The world is fucked up. Can't do anything. See what the problem is with the ""world is fucked up argument""?

&gt;Plus, AP seems to be doing pretty well. 

This is the disconnect you northerners have with us. AP is in a very horrible financial position, and of course you wouldn't know jack shit about it.

&gt;Now, what is this Cultural distance? Did we create it or did you yourself create it?

You saw the disconnect you have with us, right, when you said AP is doing well? Who created this disconnect? You or us? 

The power centre in India is in the north. It's not a wonder there's a disconnect.

In summary, you dismissed my concerns by

1. Gaslighting
2. Using ""arguments"" such as ""don't start""
3. Not even pretending to care by saying stuff like ""sorry the world is fucked up"".
4. Asking if money would come out of thin air when we have been net contributors of taxes for pretty much all of our existence

I don't think the North Koreans would continue to resist once we destroy their government, since they can be readily absorbed into China and South Korea. 

Iraq in the first gulf war was one of the largest military forces on Earth. They had over a million men serving and had 47 Infantry divisions and 9 tank divisions. That was  larger than several European armies dude. And you know what happened? 100 hours after the US intervention, Bush Senior declared a Ceasefire because we tore them multiple new assholes. In the battle of 73rd Easting, HR McMaster commanded the last great ""Tank Battle"" of modern history. He destroyed 160 Iraqi tanks, dozens more armored vehicles and only lost a single Bradley due to friendly fire lol.

In the second Iraq War, Iraq had a smaller army but still a significant one. We defeated them in like 23 days and found Saddam in December of that year. 

The USA for the last 70 years has built an army that is absolutely devastating in formal battles because we've been preparing for a war with the Soviets and the Chinese for decades. We're also the only major military with an unbroken chain of operational history which gives \*deep\* institutional knowledge. 

North Korea faces the same issues that Iraq would have. It has a gigantic army in terms of manpower, but that army is commanded by people selected for their loyalty to the Kim regime, and not their raw ability.

If we probe further, it still doesn't mean that we should bail out the current investors and management, so long as we can preserve the workers and the assets.

I think the best solution is to bail out the workers directly and let the investors and management pay the price. Investors losing money when a company goes bankrupt is a principle of market capitalism.

Some workers or worker sympathizers think that it is important to keep the company as it is. I think they are wrong because as it is the company is shitty. They cash out in good time, they don't treat workers particularly well and they would fail in less than one month of disaster.

The government money as it is bails out investors more than workers. When a company goes bankrupt, all investors are wiped out. Usually, management is also gone. However, workers in important companies are usually preserved. I think the auto bailout in 2008 was done after GM and Chrysler declared bankruptcy. I believe that the workers in general kept their jobs while the investors were wiped out. The government became the majority owner for a few years.

Also, there are two issues. One is to keep workers afloat while they have to stay home. Another is to allow workers to go back to their previous jobs once the pandemic is over. I think it is kind of premature to tackle the second issue when we don't know how long this lockdown will last. This is particularly true for airlines when many countries are impacted. Let's say the US is fine but Europe is not in two months, they will still be forced to lay off people.

$50 billion could have paid 500,000 workers $100,000 each for one year. But now these bailout money is used to pay down the debts of the companies and to pay much reduced salaries for workers. Also, the workers could still be laid off in a few months.

This is a pointless distinction.

&gt; We're not part of NATO. Our defence treaty is ANZUS. 

No shit. At no point did I say we were. I said we are a part of a defensive coalition that includes NATO countries. I was really just using it as a shorthand for Western Europe. You've never heard this collection of nations referred to as a ""coalition""?

On the F35 - 

&gt; They're plagued with cost overruns

It is true the project went over-budget, however, this is not unheard of in the early phase of projects that pushes technology forward. At the end of the day, the US military is very committed to the plane and I expect that the teething issues will be resolved.

&gt; lose in dog fights to F22

They're not designed to specialise in dog fighting, while the F22 is. They're designed to be a jack-of-all-trades, and that is the strategy adopted by the RAAF. Some basic knowledge of the plane's strategic purpose would tell you this. 

&gt; The choice to merge all the plane platforms into one was moronic

There are arguments for and against trying to base multiple variants off of one universal platform, but to call it ""moronic"" is itself moronic. Are Tesla and Subaru 'moronic' too? Because they've done the same with their cars. It is a strategy to improve cost effectiveness and is a more efficient approach to production.

&gt; so C variants can launch from aircraft carriers. Guess what we don't own?

We haven't bought any C variants and we actually have 2 aircraft carriers in service - the Canberra and the Adelaide. (helicopters are still aircraft last I checked)

&gt; Ultimately the technology makes no difference.

And we're done with this debate. This one statement shows that you know next to nothing about modern warfare. 

&gt; If Indonesia had technology that was two decades behind ours, do you think that we could handle a population forty times the size of ours?

Technological advantage is a force multiplier, meaning it allows us to punch above our weight. They could have forty times the number of planes (which they don't), but if they can't see us and they can't hit us, but we can see and hit them, then we will win the engagement. 

&gt; Or more realistically we're moving towards a more integrated world where the concept of invading nation states to settle disputes is recognised as ultimately self defeating. 

Ok, so you evidently live in a fantasy. I'd like you to please march in to Beijing or Moscow and tell them that. I'm sure they'll instantly withdraw their forces from the South China Sea, Hong Kong and the Ukraine.

&gt; The USA has never offered the F-22 for sale to any other nation and no other nation operates them.

My understanding is that the RAAF considered pushing the US for the F-22 in the early 2000's, but instead opted for the F-35. The US does indeed have an explicit ban on exporting the F-22, but the probably could have sold us a variation. 

&gt;  You should shame me for pointing out the emperor has no clothes

Calling our military ""useless"" and our defence strategy ""moronic"" isn't constructive criticism. It shows you have no interest in being part of building this nation up, but instead you just want tear it down for the sake of it.

One Japanese prime minister tried to stop expansion in Manchuria so they could actually safeguard it from the Chinese civil war and hand it back later to avoid future conflict with China.

With more safeguards and control and such, this would probably end up happening and generating a lot of goodwill. With the right involvement the course of the war could likely go against the communoists with the Republic of China under Chiang Kai-shek  winning. Japan could lobby and fund anti-impeiralist, pro-Japanese parties in the Pacific to get them to join the 'Japanese co-prosperity sphere' as it was called and have a mandate for intervening militarily when the European empires tighten their grip on the region in retaliation.

If or when this happens the Japanese would win decisively as they did in 1941, shocking the world and dramatically improving their support in the region. If Japan never leaves the League of Nations, which is likely in this case, they might even gain international support for intervening in the area.

&amp;#x200B;

Japan might not be so attracted to Germany here with all these changes, so the Pacific theater of WW2 might not flare up like it did and could potentially have been handled diplomatically with much less US involvement. So the US going to war with Germany might take more time, possibly resulting in more soviet influence over Europe.

Empires still crumble globally but the co-prosperity sphere could potentially look like a Japanese-centric EU, if all the liberated nations of the Pacific decide to stick with Japan. This could potentially just take the form of a defense pact and possibly some common foreign policy and economic policies.


Edit for clarification:

In this situation there are more moderate politicians are in control, with a leash on the military, more political stability and a still pretty strong nationalist presence. The co-prosperity sphere could be thought of by some Japanese as being an empire by stealth using the consent of other nations. Some would be genuinely anti-imperialist, others seeing it as a means to an end with anti-imperialist sentiments eventually getting more popular by the 1960s or 70s, though perhaps not fast enough  to avoid disintegration or serious change to the co-prosperity sphere as partner/subject nations develop. 

Considering the degree of control over the subject peoples by the colonial empires, so Japan could give more freedom whilst still having them subservient to Japan. Easy justification being Japan has the army, so they support Japan and management of the sphere tries to cement in the staus-quo. Gradual development would be necessary, but Japan would likely seek to keep partner/subject nations as dependent on Japan as possible. So Japan would probably seek to at least provide the bulk of the military might and be the only ones producing weapons and ships.

I thought the current administration had taken significant steps towards securing parental leave, but I may be wrong. I know Dan Crenshaw introduced a bill to facilitate just that. That doesn't seem like such a partisan issue as you are trying to paint it. I'm not against a sensible amount of paid leave.

An emergency aid payout doesn't create the same perverse incentive as saying we'll give you more money if you're a single parent. The more you spend the more we'll give you etc. This benefits single parents who are financially irresponsible. It's horrible for the kids, for the parents and for society in general.

You have far superior healthcare from us. That costs more. You are also a less healthy population on average. No country can afford quality healthcare for everyone, other than places like Monte Carlo that's just a tax haven for wealthy bankers. You have free clinics and the option of insurance, we only have the free clinics. Is our solution better?

&gt;This is wrong. You are actually quoting Trump from a speech he did a few years ago where he (like always) had some undocumented argument about hospitals in the UK being flooded in blood.

Didn't even know this was a thing. Never quoted trump. I'm a British person, I don't need the President to ""back up my facts"". I also never claimed that Europe's knife violence is higher than the United States, just that the violence in itself is high. The reason I said that, is because in those countries, people will find anything to hurt others with, and considering the lack of self defense, and also the lax immigration laws, have knife violence cases in the thousand's every year. 

&gt;In any way, should it have been true, you don’t see news articles about “mass school stabbings” in Europe several times a year.

Strawman here. You won't see a ""mass school stabbing"", because it's a lot harder to bring a knife into school as a child, and stab everyone, compared the United States. The concern is with the gangs and assaultings, that happen all over.

&gt;This is also not true. This would mean than China and India would be way higher on the list of number of shootings.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but in these dirt poor communist countries, obtaining a gun outside of the military is surely equivalent to a year's salary. Terrible crimes still happen in those areas, albeit with the lack of self defense.

My opinion is still that any guns outside recreational use is unnecessary, like the ones in this video, and that if you do own a gun you should not have the gun and it’s ammunition easily accessible.
I respect that, I respect that a lot. In my eyes, I believe that it would hurt the passionate gun owners, and their law abiding efforts. If anything, there should be regulations on who should own a gun, and the raise the difficulty of legally acquiring and training with one.

I mean, yeah, he use the word PANDEMIC, only to keep saying it's not worth doing anything about it.

&gt; No, he doesn't. The Independent purposefully took his words out of context. 

Was the article provided by you supposed to prove that? Because it didn't:

'The President of Belarus has repeatedly spoken out about the need to continue economic activity. On April 7, Lukashenko said that Belarus should focus on resolving its economic issues, and not discuss the introduction of quarantine in the country. On March 27, the politician praised the statement by the US leader, who asked Americans to return to work to save the economy.'

and:

'On April 13, Lukashenko said that in Belarus coronavirus-infected people die from chronic diseases and no one has died from COVID-19 in the country.'

Boris removed all that from the Withdrawal Agreement. 

The EU removed the level playing field stuff because they realised that was the only way to get the WA through parliament. In other words they caved on something important to them.

It's possible they thought it was a cosmetic concession because they were confident of getting the level playing field stuff put into the main trade treaty. Remember they made these concessions before the general election and appear to have believed that Boris's government would suffer a set-back in those elections.

According to an [article](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4227394?seq=1) in the *Journal of Economic Issues:*

&gt;Once communism had been established in Eastern Europe, GNP per capita grew significantly faster than the GNP per capita of capitalist countries... The overall experience in Eastern Europe indicates that communism narrowed the income gap between the poor Eastern European countries and the richest Western countries.

For many Eastern Bloc countries, communism provided a much higher rate of growth than they would otherwise have had. A good example of this is the Soviet Union itself. According to a [study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.ces.8100101) in the journal *Comparative Economic Studies:*

&gt;The Soviet Union grew rapidly by comparison with other countries at a similar stage of development... **It is unlikely that the Tsarist economy would have done so well had the 1917 revolution not occurred.** Recalculations of national income since 1928 indicate that growth was not confined to investment or military equipment but included consumption \[i.e. living standards\] in the 1930s.

This is all the more impressive when one remembers the extraordinarily adverse conditions faced by many socialist states. To quote from the aforementioned *Journal of Economic Issues* paper:

&gt;GNP per capita of the Soviet Union grew from one-twelfth that of the United States in 1917 to one-third that of the United States by 1991. That performance occurred despite numerous brutal civil wars initiated by foreign capitalist powers, despite a very destructive Nazi invasion that reduced real Soviet output by more than 20 percent between 1941 and 1945, \[and\] despite a perceived need to spend a substantial amount on the military to defend against various cold war threats.

Your image also begins in 1938, while most of the Eastern Bloc did not take shape until the mid-to-late 1940's. This period obviously resulted in serious changes to the material conditions of these countries. For instance, the GDR (East Germany) faced significant disadvantages as a direct result of WWII and the division of Germany, despite previously having had a higher GDP-per-capita than the West. These factors resulted in the GDR starting out much less developed than the West; according to a [study](https://www.deepdyve.com/lp/ou-press/the-roots-of-economic-failure-what-explains-east-germany-s-falling-A6wSaF2DRj?key=OUP) in the *European Review of Economic History* (published in 2014), ""the major factor contributing to this early divergence were disproportions in industrial structure caused by the division of Germany."" The study goes on to note:

&gt;The ""Great Divergence"" between East and West in industrial efficiency did not begin in 1948, when the institutional development of the two parts of the country took fundamentally different paths. The main factors contributing to this divergence were already present earlier.

Despite this, there is a real argument to be made that the GDR achieved a faster rate of growth. Perhaps the most extensive [study](https://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/bitstream/handle/document/28587/ssoar-hsrsupp-2009-no_21-heske-volkswirtschaftliche_gesamtrechnung_ddr_1950-1989.pdf) on this topic was done by Gerhard Heske, published in the journal *Historical Social Research* in Germany; however, seeing as this study is about three-hundred pages long, I'll quote a summary [article](http://www.memo.uni-bremen.de/docs/m3309.pdf) from the University of Bremen:

&gt;From 1951 to 1989, the GDR achieved an average GDP growth rate of 4.5%, the FRG 4.3%. From 1961 to 1985, these growth rates were higher in the GDR than in the FRG.

The example of Germany is especially important because it includes other factors, such as the Marshall Plan (which helped to boost growth in the West), debt forgiveness for the West (the GDR paid far more of its war debt than the FRG), and the more favorable trade conditions given to the West.

In addition, it should not be forgotten that socialist nations tend/tended to have a higher quality of life than capitalist nations at the same level of development. A well-known [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1646771/) published in the *American Journal of Public Health* found that ""socialist countries generally have achieved better PQL \[physical quality of life\] outcomes than the capitalist countries at equivalent levels of economic development."" Another [study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2190/EQUY-ACG8-X59F-AE99), published in the *International Journal of Health Services*, found that ""in general, nations with strong left-wing regimes have more favorable health outcomes (e.g., longer life expectancies and lower mortality rates) than do those with strong right-wing regimes.""

This all coincides with the results of a [study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2190/B2TP-3R5M-Q7UP-DUA2) from Johns Hopkins University, published in the *International Journal of Health Services*,  which states that ""contrary to dominant ideology, socialism and socialist forces have been, for the most part, better able to improve health conditions than have capitalism and capitalist forces."" The author goes on to state that ""the historical experience of socialism has not been one of failure. To the contrary: it has been, for the most part, more successful than capitalism in improving the health conditions of the world's populations.""

Thus, if two countries have/had roughly similar levels of economic development, the socialist nation will generally have a higher quality of life. I hope this has provided a sufficient response.

So, it looms over the ocean. Sorry, there's no way to achieve your 'not breaching the surface' condition without making it an order of magnitude or two smaller!  

The top of it's shell is in the upper atmosphere (we'll ignore temperature and oxygen issues). The bottom is still tens of km in the air. The feet are themselves ten km across at the tip and create craters a km deep every time they're placed. It's tall enough that, with it's eyes that are each 10km in diameter, it can perceive the curvature of the earth and the generalities of landmasses. It can't see anything on a human scale however, it's just too massive.  

Even stationary, this thing will have some insane effects on the atmosphere and weather systems. I'd imagine that it causes immense rains in its proximity, and probably high winds. Think the impact the Himalayas have on global weather patterns. It'll effect ocean currents also - lack of sunlight on the ocean beneath it will cause cooling and immense die offs of animals and plants which rely on sunlight. More complex animals may struggle to navigate or orient without sun and moonlight.  

If it moves? Shit. Conservatively it can move at 100km per second (scaling against number of bodylengths per second normal crabs can move). Every time it puts a limb down the footprint is 10km wide; on solid ground it'll probably penetrate a km downwards. Which means 80-ish cubic km of material is disturbed with every step. Most of it will be violently displaced laterally. This thing won't quite be creating mountains with every step, but it will be creating enormous craters. On water it's even worse. In open ocean each step displaces a column of water of 314km^3 (assuming 4km ocean depth - it'll be greater or less in places where ocean is deeper or shallower respectively).  

To put it another way, in 10 steps our behemoth crab will have moved as much material as the [Storegga Slide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storegga_Slide). That event reshaped the coastline of northern Europe, quite possibly hastened the creation the English Channel, and wiped out whole populations of mesolithic humans. It's suggested that nowadays a 500km^3 displacement could create a tsunami which would kill millions.  

That's of course forgetting about direct earthquake effects, which are likely to be severe given this thing will be taking many steps per second.  

Also, when this thing moves it's displacing literally millions of cubic kilometres of air. Given how fast it's moving it'll create a truly insane pressure front in front of it, and a vacuum behind it. We're talking far beyond hurricanes here - it'll probably create massive tornado effects around and beneath it's body, and beyond hurricane force winds for tens of km around it. Storm winds for hundreds if not thousands. Also, it's going to force air to different altitudes so there will be effects on temperature and precipitation.  

So yeah, the minute this thing starts moving it triggers a rolling localised apocalypse against which there is no defence. If humanity survives anywhere it'll be in the centre of the larger continents, but only if the thing decides it doesn't want to walk there.  

No, we can't kill it without nukes.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Libya

&gt;25% of the population of Tripoli was still Jewish in 1941 and 44 synagogues were maintained in the city.[11] In 1942, German troops fighting the Allies in North Africa occupied the Jewish quarter of Benghazi, plundering shops and deporting more than 2,000 Jews across the desert. Sent to work in labor camps, more than one-fifth of this group of Jews perished. Jews were concentrated in the cities of Tripoli and Benghazi, with small communities in Bayda and Misrata.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Tunisia

&gt;When the Nazis invaded Vichy Tunisia, the country was home to some 100,000 Jews. According to Yad Vashem, the Nazis imposed antisemitic policies including forcing Jews to wear the yellow badge (Star of David), fines, and confiscation of property. More than 5,000 Jews were sent to forced labor camps, where 265 are known to have died. An additional 160 Jews of Tunisia living in France were sent to extermination camps in continental Europe.
