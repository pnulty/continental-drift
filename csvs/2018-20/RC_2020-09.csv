It depends on what you like. It can be good or bad. 

&gt;And if I were to move there from the US, how could I be as respectful as possible?

By learning Italian and speaking Italian. But how do you plan to move from the US? Do you have an EU Passport? It's almost impossible to live/work in Italy without EU citizenship. 

Nobody even knows when Americans will be allowed to VISIT Italy again. It depends on when (or if ever) the US gets control of the coronavirus, and it does not look like that will happen any time soon especially with the current administration. 

&gt;What's housing like

Crowded in the cities.

&gt;what does it look like to get a job? 

Difficult even for locals. 

&gt;What's the cost of living compared to minimum wage?

There isn't a ""mininum"" wage in Italy.

&gt;How's the climate 

It varies a lot from North to South.

&gt;how are the people?

Good people, but political correctness is not common like in the US. More backward in the sense that gender roles are very traditional here; a lot of women have never had a job. Still, I think Italians are more relaxed than Americans, and usually enjoy life more.

You haven‚Äôt beaten any of my arguments.
You literally said that they are stakes because the villain will take over the world. So that means that Ronan from guardians of the galaxy is the best villain cause he could destroy an entire planet very easily and that means the villain in Thor the dark work is one of the best too cause he almost took over the world.

Your way of reviewing a movie you honestly sound like a 7 year old who hasn‚Äôt seen many movies. ‚ÄúWow rhinos good cgi‚Äù ‚Äúwow he wants to take over the world‚Äù really bro I‚Äôm pretty sure that you haven‚Äôt even seen movies like The Godfather or taxi driver. Just superhero flicks and bad cgi movies. The cgi in black panther is objectively terrible, if you like the rest of the movie that‚Äôs fine but if you really can‚Äôt see the flaws in the cgi then you‚Äôre blind or you have never seen a movie with gold effects.
I want you to watch James Cameron‚Äôs Avatar or even Jurassic Park. Those have better CGI than black panther. And they came out even before black panther. Iron Man 1 has good cgi even better than black panther.
If you really can‚Äôt see that the special effects in black panther are bad then you‚Äôre a shill from this movie and you like this movie cause it has black oriole, simple as that ‚Äúoh diversity is the best thing cause if I say it‚Äôs bad I might be a racist‚ÄùüòÇüòÇ nah bro worst effects in any marvel movie right next to the Incredible Hulk. 

Killmonger is not intimidating. Like I said before I review films from an adult and intelectual perspective, I‚Äôm the type of guy that agreees with Martin Scorsese that marvel isn‚Äôt real cinema. Killmonger is not intimidating, yes his motivations make sense, I never said that Killmonger is a bad villain but he is just overrated. The biggest problem with killmonger is he doesn‚Äôt feel like an actual character he is just an obstacle for black panther, remember when I said that the plot of this movie is a mess? The first half of this movie is completely different from the second half, Killmongers plan is stupid, why did he wait so long to kill Klaus? Why did we as the audience have to war one hour of chasing a villain that has zero importance to the story besides dying? 
That is because Killmonger sadly isn‚Äôt developed enough to be seen as an actual character for me, he has so little screen time. Compare Killmonger to Joker from the dark knight or Thanos, or even Voldemort, or Bane. All this villain actually feel like real characters and not just obstacles. Just because one is powerful doesn‚Äôt make them good. Killmonger is an obstacle not a character, they tried to make him a character but the script is a mess. 
Secondly do you know why Killmonger is not intimidating? The acting. Michael B Jordan is a good actor but his performance was very weak. First of all Killmonger is a very aggressive character, but Michael B Jordan plays him like his very calm his basically underacting him. If you don‚Äôt know what underacting is it‚Äôs basically when an actor plays a character that‚Äôs very dull and calm but then snaps at any second while still maintaining some level of calmness. For example Gus Fring from Breaking Bad. The actor is underacting the character because it fits with how the script and story want him to be. But Killmonger doesn‚Äôt fit, his always aggressive his accent and tone don‚Äôt fit with Gus Fring at all. This movie can be badly directed at times since the actors don‚Äôt fit the acting with the scene, like when Black Panther arrives from the dead and Killmonger says ‚Äúwassup‚Äù that like is incredibly cringy and stupid, it doesn‚Äôt fit with the character of Killmonger at all. Imagine if Thanos said ‚Äúwassup‚Äù it doesn‚Äôt fit right? Same thing goes with Killmonger. 

They are no stakes because the characters are stupid. So basically black panther agrees to fight Killmonger even if he knows that Killmonger is a psychopath that saved Klaw? When Andy Serkis escape with Killmonger the camera focuses on the necklace and black panther sees it, he knows that Killmonger helped Klaw escaped, so why the fuck is he willing to give up the thrown for a fraudüòÇüòÇ it just feels so forced and it‚Äôs obvious what the writers are trying to do but it‚Äôs so badly written and so predictable it ruins the experience. 

They where no stakes when Killmonger won, zero. You honestly though he was going to win? Bro it‚Äôs a marvel movie for kidsüòÇ and even if he did win the avengers could‚Äôve easily stopped it. Don‚Äôt you think that Thor can‚Äôt battle Wakanda? Thor literally saved Wakanda in avengers infinity war. Or Scarlet Witch or Hulk or Vision or even Iron Man since he is one of the smartest people in the world of the MCU just imagine what he would do with Wakanda technology he would definitely do better than Shuri. 
Oh and now on the subject of vibranium, it has literally become a plot device for vibranium to do whatever you want it to do, wether it‚Äôs heal people from getting shot in the back or even bringing them back from the death. That‚Äôs another reason as to why they are no stakes.

When black panther gets defeated and ‚Äúdies‚Äù and then he comes back the big problem is that he comes back too soon. They should‚Äôve shown his journey and how Killmonger would rule, they should‚Äôve shown more of the ‚ÄúWakanda civil war‚Äù and disagreements between their people, why do people agree with Killmonger just because he wants to take over the world? Is there something deeper. This movie is not deep at all it‚Äôs just very blandly written and so underwhelming cause it could‚Äôve had potential but just another mediocre marvel movie that took itself too seriously. 


Wakanda is one of the stupidest places in the mcu by how dumb it is. Let me give you an example: Imagine if in Thor Ragnarok or Aquaman they included a great, bustling, technologically advanced Hyperborea that was populated exclusively by tall, blonde white people. Where they exclusively practiced ancient Norse/Germanic culture and spoke Proto Indo European, and the head of the kingdom was some kind of Aryan Super Human wielding an axe and shield, riding around in a chariot....
That movie wouldn‚Äôt even find funding. But even if it did the law suits and outrage would prevent it from ever being filmed.  

That concept is exactly what Black Panther is, but because the movie is about a socially accepted race and culture, it was nominated for best picture. That‚Äôs it.

&gt;possible for the United States to rein China back in peacefully or to break it's back in 2020. Are you hoping for a world war? I'm listening if you're willing to try to convince me otherwise.

I'm not hoping for war, I'm saying things could go either way, and avoiding unpleasantries only defers conflict. I'm saying that conflicts should be taken taken head on and situations should be resolved post haste instead of letting them simmer. Like you said, the world waited 40 years, and still no recognition for Taiwan. I say  let's stop patronizing CCP sentiments, recognise Taiwan officially throughout the world, and if CCP takes that excuse to stay a conflict, let's take that head on too.



&gt;difficult proposition but far more likely than the United States coming to save the day

US govt will not poll citizens of China attacks Taiwan. I don't think EU will sit out either.

What is worse than China attacking right now, in my opinion, is China normalising it's aggressive behaviour for, say, a decade and *then* attacking. That will be like Pakistan normalising supporting terrorism in Afghanistan and India for decades, to the extent that their ex-ISI chief can go to Oxford University and openly declare that terrorists in India were ""their men"", so when something like Kargil War happens the international community doesn't bat an eye.

The Japanese thinking was that this empire, guarded by their formidable fleet, would be so difficult for the Americans to attack that one of two scenarios would transpire: 

1.) the US would sue for peace rather than attempt a risky and likely costly attack against the newly expanded and strengthened Japanese Empire

2.) the US would recover from Pearl Harbor and attempt offensive operations against Japan. The Americans would then sustain enormous losses that they were unwilling to bear- probably in part through a single decisive fleet battle dominated by battleships- after which they would sue for peace. 

Neither of those things happened, of course. US leaders never for a moment considered negotiations after Pearl Harbor and instead used a combination of industrial power and plain old guts to grind their empire down and ultimately force Japan to capitulate. 

There really is no scenario where Japan grabs it‚Äôs 1942 empire without fighting the US. This was primarily due to the large US presence in the Philippines, and also because many of the territories that Japan wanted were already European colonies, so attacking them would mean attacking US allies.

When I said [other people] could make their own Star Wars stories, we decided that, like Star Trek, we would have two universes: My universe and then this other one.

&gt;‚ÄúFor me and my training here at Lucasfilm, working with George, he and I always thought the Expanded Universe was just that. It was an expanded universe. Basically it‚Äôs stories that are really fun and really exciting, but they‚Äôre a view on Star Wars, not necessarily canon to him.That was the way it was from the day I walked into Lucasfilm with him all through Clone Wars, everything we worked on, he felt the Clone Wars series and his movies were what was actually the reality of it all, the canon, then there was everything else. So it wasn‚Äôt a big dynamic shift for me mentally when there was this big announcement saying the EU is now Legends.

Relative to prior generations, none of these countries have benefited in a top-five dominant world relative to their competition.

Denmark won the Euros in 1992 and finished third in 1984.  They have been nowhere near that level in in the post-2000 big five dominant world.

Sweden's golden eras were in the 1950s and and early 1990s.  They have not come close to that level since.

Switzerland have never made it pass the round of 16 in any tournament so 1954, so I am not sure how they are success story.

Colombia is the only team who has been good relative to prior eras post 2000, when they they won and finished fourth in the Copa America in 2001 and 2004.  However, their 2001 Copa America team featured 17 players from the Colombian league and only 1 playing in Europe.  Their 2018 World Cup team that got eliminated in the round of 16 had three players from Colombia.

Again, my point is not that these countries would have been better off by forcing their players to stay.  My point is that the current centralization of talent and financial power in five countries, has benefited those countries more than anyone else.

&gt;Selling clubs don't make their money from fans, they make their money from transfers, which in turn funds the league and incentives the continued production of talent. In the last 20 years, Benfica has had an income of *1.27 billion USD* from outbound transfers, Porto has 1.24b. Ajax? 845m. PSV, 490m. Shaktar Donetsk, 446m, Boca Juniors, 431m.

Everyone of these clubs produced and developed talent prior to the current dominance of five leagues.  They would still be producing talent absent such a development.

If MLS only ever is a development league built on feeding talent to European leagues, it is never going to gain much popularity in this country, which will make it very difficult for soccer generally break through an become part of the American culture.",True,False,False,,,,0,1598924853,,1598925327,0,{},g3jis6x,False,t3_ijyv3s,False,True,t1_g3jhd8a,/r/ussoccer/comments/ijyv3s/if_mls_becomes_a_selling_league_and_stays_that/g3jis6x/,False,,1611392799,0,True,False,ussoccer,t5_2sk2p,r/ussoccer,public,,0,[],

Afterpay is obviously the big player and has the most market reach and is entering the largest number of markets

PayPal does have a huge customer base and can pivot into BNPL with the right plays. It all will depend on ease of use ect..... They have a lot of potential but can also flop. I have seen a BNPL option on PayPal before and didn't look as appealing as the others

The next players is where it comes interesting. There isn't room for SZL SPT and Z1P plus more, Z1P is also clearly the biggest out of the ""others"". Acquisitions will most likely happen and big guys will buy out little ones especially with the demand to invest here and how quickly capital can be raised.

This is all about consumer usage not profitability

But in my opinion we are looking at a Uber/Lyft/Didi kinda situation where everyone competes but unlike this situation I think once a consumer for example chooses afterpay they aren't moving. No customer will move permanently to a smaller BNPL but they may get it as a 2nd option if they can access particular shops that another cannot. However you will see consumer jump from smaller BNPL to a bigger one like APT. So its realistically a 1 way stream (unless they gain some crazy features but bigger players can implement things faster too with bigger development teams)

Most companies are focusing US/UK/AUS but what about the Asian markets? APT is pushing them now too while also coming after the rest of Europe.

They should almost say fk it let them get organic growth in the US/UK/AUS and then push Asian markets harder because they will have no competition there. Its a long way away till z1p szl or spt will enter other markets as they r just coming into US and UK too.

What capitalists define as progress (economic growth, rather than collective wellbeing) to me is bullshit.

I watched a documentary on YouTube about the state of the railways in the US and it was saying that the lobbyists for cars, and highway builders, and I think airlines as well, all lobbied against it. 

A huge transit system in America would be amazing and save so much traffic on the roads and highways in America and pollution as well. Even when I look at the existing ones like of huge cities like LA I‚Äôm surprised by how sparse it is in comparison to London. In London there‚Äôs a train station like every few roads or 5 minutes walking time. And when you look at the national rail system of America map it literally looks like an uninhabited desert or Siberia with lack of routes and stations. Shocking for the world‚Äôs richest country!

And whatta ya know, Germany putting communists in camps. What do you think he does? I think that Trotsky would plow through Eastern Europe and Scandinavia and invade Germany.

Now think about how this looks to the West. This is before the Holocaust or before Germany could invade anyone. Anti-communist tensions are already very high. All they see is the aggressive Soviet Union trying to take over Europe. Not only that, but this was just the thing Hitler was waiting for. This entire time he was going on about how ‚Äúthe bolshevik jews are trying to destroy Germany‚Äù when suddenly a bolshevik jew tries to destroy Germany. This would look really good for him. Just like how in our timeline capitalism and communism united against fascism, in this alternate timeline democracy and fascism unite against communism.

In this alternate World War II there are of course two sides: The Socialist Powers and the Allied Powers. The Socialist Powers are the Soviet Union, Spain, Mongolia, and Tuva. The Allied Powers are basically the rest of the world, but the big five that you need to worry about are the United States, Britain, France, Germany, and Japan.

Now I know what you‚Äôre thinking: since the Japanese and the Americans are on the same side, and therefore there is no attack on Pearl Harbor, why do the Americans get involved? Keep in mind that the United States, while it was at this time mostly isolationist, was much more willing to get involved in European affairs when it came to stopping the spread of communism. Remember that the United States aided the White Army during the Russian Civil War. So I think that if the Soviet Union invaded the West, the United States would get involved right away.

So how does this war play out? The sheer numbers and brutal tactics of the Red Army along with the harsh geography of the Soviet Union would make this a longer, more drawn-out war than in our timeline. Spain would probably be the first to fall since it‚Äôs surrounded by France and Portugal and cut off from the rest of the Socialist Powers, meanwhile Tuva and Mongolia, while much less powerful, hug right up against the Soviet Union and therefore would be harder to take. Spain wouldn‚Äôt fall right away though. The Soviets would probably send a large amount of support to the Spanish front so it would take a while to wear them down. Spain falls in 1941 when French, Portugese, and American forces take Madrid.

Meanwhile the fighting in Central Europe and Asia is much more dragged out. In Asia, Japan and China are pushing back against the communists in Mongolia and Siberia. In Central Europe, no side is able to push back the other until the United States and Germany develop atomic bombs.

In 1945 Roosevelt and Hitler meet in DC to discuss when and where to drop the first atomic bomb. Hitler wants to drop one right in the middle of Moscow, but Roosevelt and the rest of the delegates agree that that‚Äôs too drastic. They decide to drop an atomic bomb on Tsaritsyn as a warning. The Allies give Trotsky an ultimatum to unconditionally surrender or else they‚Äôll nuke another city. Trotsky refuses. Odessa is nuked. Trotsky, ever-stubborn, still refuses to surrender. The allies as a last resort threaten to nuke Kiev, Leningrad, and Moscow. Trotsky still wants to keep fighting, but at this point the Party is sick of his shit so they throw him out of office and have him imprisoned. The interim Premier agrees to unconditional surrender.

After the war the allies go through the process of dividing up Europe. The Soviet Union is split into independent former Soviet Socialist Republics. Russia is split into four independent states. Everything west of the Ural mountains is split into a North Russia and a South Russia, plus an independent Karelia. Everything east of the Ural mountains becomes an independent Siberia. Spain is split into a North Spain and a South Spain, plus an independent Catalonia and Basque Country. Japan annexes a bit of Siberia and Mongolia, and the US annexes a small chunk of Eastern Siberia since it‚Äôs right next to Alaska. France takes Spain‚Äôs colonies. Germany takes a portion of Poland and Czechoslovakia since they were destroyed by the Red Army anyway and the allies figured Germany had earned it.

The allies set up new governments in the former Socialist Powers and the states that they invaded. Southern Eastern Europe and Asia are under American influence, while Northern Eastern Europe and Central Europe are under German influence. What follows is a Cold War between democracy and fascism.

Much like how in our timeline World War II delegitimized fascism, in this alternate timeline socialism is delegitimized. Left-wing policies are much more unpopular, whereas more nationalist policies become more popular.

[],,TheBluntReport,,,,[],,,,text,t2_4928rncv,False,False,[],"Jack Johnson was the son of ex-slaves and the third of 9 children. His debut came at the age of 20 where he fought ‚Äì and knocked out ‚Äì Charley Brooks, winning him a purse of just $1.50. As Johnson made more of a name for himself, he was unable to challenge for the heavyweight crown as the current title holder Jim Jeffries refused to fight him; something that was common within the boxing world in that era.

As time went on, and due to Johnson‚Äôs obvious skill as well as his bravado and popularity, a chance at the heavyweight title was on the horizon. Johnson made a point to follow the new heavyweight champion Tommy Burns around the globe, taunting him in front of the press for a duration of 2 years, until he finally provoked a match. This title fight occurred in 1908 in Sydney, Australia and the fight was only agreed on by Burns as he was guaranteed a large purse of $30,000. The police stepped in at the 14th round and stopped the fight, with Johnson being declared the winner.

This moment flared up racial animosity, with a portion of whites calling for a ‚ÄúGreat White Hope‚Äù to take the title from Johnson. The New York Times itself even wrote ""If the black man wins, thousands and thousands of his ignorant brothers will misinterpret his victory as justifying claims to much more than mere physical equality with their white neighbors‚Äù. Famously during this racial animosity, Winston Churchill banned a scheduled fight in England, as well as the entrance of Johnson. Whether due to public pressure, or the possibility of a black man beating an English soldier in the heart of the British Empire, Churchill declared that Johnson‚Äôs fight was ‚Äúnot in the best interests of the nation‚Äù. This clearly had a large effect on Johnson, who previously thought of England as the bastion of civilisation, but later stated that the British were hypocrites and no better than Americans.

In 1910, Johnson finally got his chance to fight Jim Jeffries in what was dubbed ‚Äúthe fight of the century‚Äù. This was a humbling moment for Jeffries who, after the loss, declared ‚ÄúI could never have whipped Johnson at my best‚Äù.

Johnson also faced persecution in his life outside of boxing. Notably, he was arrested in 1912 for violating the Mann Act ‚Äì jurisdiction that forbade ‚Äútransporting women across state lines for immoral purposes‚Äù ‚Äì after travelling with his white girlfriend Lucille Cameron. Though this case fell apart, Johnson was later arrested for similar reasons due to his relationship with Belle Schreiber, a relationship that occurred before the Mann Act even existed. In front of an all-white jury, with Kenesaw Landis presiding over the case (the man who fought for disallowing black baseball players, known as the baseball color line), Schreiber testified against Johnson and he was sentenced to prison. Johnson skipped bail and fled with his wife to France. For seven years, they lived in exile across Europe, South America and Mexico, until finally he surrendered himself at the Mexican border.¬†",True,False,False,,,,0,1598939875,,False,0,{},g3k610a,True,t3_ikew4r,False,True,t3_ikew4r,/r/ADifferentEra/comments/ikew4r/this_is_jack_johnson_with_his_wife_etta_terry/g3k610a/,False,,1611404526,3,True,False,ADifferentEra,t5_2xbip,r/ADifferentEra,public,,0,[],

I went to school in NZ as well. So I know full well that is the case (I almost failed Maori class haha), and remember when use to learn the Haka, visit various Whanau's and learned a good amount of Maori culture like the legends of Maui.

But regardless, NZ history is still caucasian focused. Yes, we learn the treaty of Waitangi, but in literature, we still focus on Shakespeare and in history pre-1700, that of Europe. All of our history classes are in English. I am not saying this is bad a thing, it would be silly to learn Shakespeare in Maori.

Similarly in Inner Mongolia, the only policy change is to teach Literature etc in Mandarin. Maths/Science are still taught in Mongolian. NZ does not go this far at all - I don't know of s single school that conducts physics/maths class in the Maori language.

So my point is before we throw stones at what they're doing in China, we should recognise that it is hardly that extreme. Mongolian culture is as well supported there is Maori is in NZ.

East India Company is also just a trading company but their ships are heavily armed for their time. Besides, we know that the said company recruits from ex-military (just like PMCs of the 21st century) and has access to helicopter gunships that are clearly armed with lethal weapons and mechs designed for combat. That means that at the very least it is a well-trained and funded mercenary group. For comparison, modern day PMCs (like the Russian Wagner Group) have access to T-72 tanks, heavy artillery and helicopter gunships.

&gt;Yeah, thats why they were losing until the planetary intelligence that nobody was really sure existed or cared called in a zerg rush.

These animals are nowhere near as tough as armored vehicles. Considering the fact that the US army in the 1990s has no problem destroying numerically superior Iraqi armored units in the battle of 73 easting (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_73_Easting), I'd say the local wildlife is toast.

&gt;Because they weren't a military with military objectives. They were a mining company with a very limited charter and strict prohibition from engaging in hostilities with the native population.

They are, as I have established above, a well-trained and funded mercenary group commanded by former officers. The security forces is also defiant of other human staff from the same company (like the scientist). This means that there is a clear chain of command and the security forces are treating it as a military operation. 

Additionally, it is shown in the movie that they have access to napalm bombs. I don't think those are designed for mining. Thus, it can be deduced that the mercenaries have access to military grade weapons, which can be used in their operation but they somehow just refuse to use them.

&gt;It was a dozen or two vehicles equivalent to hummers vs hundreds of angry 20+ ton rhino type creatures, and a dozen or two blackhawks vs hundreds of literal dragons, that attacked out of nowhere and gave the humans all of seconds to respond to the threat.

Numerical superiority does not translate to actual strength. Animals can zerg rush the humans, but where is the indirect fire support for the humans? The thing is, if there are hundreds of 20+ ton rhinos running in a dense forest, the movement can easily be spotted and tracked. Long range weapons can be used to deal with them. Also, the humans in the movie clearly had access to unmanned bulldozers, they could have used these heavy vehicles as scouts in front of the main force. Finally, the range of claws and horns is significantly shorter than that of autocannons and rockets. The animals will suffer from heavy casualties before they even reach the human lines. Dead bodies will start to pile up in front of the human gunline, making additional charges significantly more difficult. Finally, humans have actually used animal charges in warfare. Incendiary pigs (pigs doused with combustible pitch, crude oil or resin) were used to break the siege of Megara in 266 BC.

Oh BTW, not a big problem but those helicopters are definitely better armed than pure transports like the blackhawk.

&gt;The movie wasn't Humans vs Navi. It was a small deliberately undergunned mining company vs the Navi.

European colonists are not fully militarized as there are women and children in their ranks. They can still defeat most local tribes in North America.

In 1918, Stalin created the ""[Jewish Section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yevsektsiya)"" (Evsection) of the People's Commissariat for Nationalities. The structure dealt with the problems of settling the Jewish people in the USSR. One of her most important projects was the organization of Jewish agricultural communes. The Bolsheviks managed to get money from Jewish organizations in the United States and Western Europe. For example, the ""Agro Joint"" (James Rosenberg) propagated that ""in the countryside, the urban Jew will lose his nervousness and impatience.""

In 1924, the Bolsheviks created the ""[Komzet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komzet)"". It was planned that even before the end of 1926, approximately 500 thousand Jews would receive 100 thousand hectares of land for cultivation in the Ukrainian SSR and the Crimean ASSR of the RSFSR.

In 1927, the first Jewish national region in the USSR was created in the Kherson region of Ukraine. In 1929, the Novozlatopol Jewish national district arose in the Zaporozhye region, in 1930 - the Stalindorf one in the Dnepropetrovsk region and the Freidorf one in the Crimea. 

The [American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Jewish_Joint_Distribution_Committee) has conducted fundraising throughout the United States in support of Jewish autonomy. For six years (1928-34), the organization donated $ 250 million to the foundation of the Jewish Autonomous Region. In addition, she donated a large amount of agricultural equipment and seeds to future colonists.

In 1930, the Birobidzhan National Region was formed, and on May 7, 1934, the [Jewish Autonomous Region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Autonomous_Oblast) was formed as part of the [Far Eastern Territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_East). Every second Jew returned back in less than a year. Terrible climate, lack of infrastructure and big cities. 

Jewish autonomous regions in the European part of the USSR existed until the Second World War. All Party initiatives were destroyed by Stalin.

There is a lot of information about how Stalin's own entourage was repressed. His daughter from his first marriage ([Svetlana Alliluyeva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svetlana_Alliluyeva)) was in love with a Jew [Aleksei Kapler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksei_Kapler), he was exiled to the GULAG. [Molotov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vyacheslav_Molotov)'s wife [Polina Zhemchuzhina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polina_Zhemchuzhina) was sent to Kazakhstan. Stalin personally read the ""revelation"". He read it on public (and Molotov himself) about how she had group sex with her former assistants. The reason was her friendship with [Mikhoels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Mikhoels) and [Fefer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itzik_Feffer) (actors), her visit to a Moscow synagogue in March 1945, and the fact that after the establishment of diplomatic relations between the USSR and Israel, she approached Ambassador [Golda Meir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golda_Meir) at a reception and spoke to her in Yiddish.",True,False,False,,,,0,1598948258,,False,0,{},g3kefwl,False,t3_ik1gmv,False,True,t1_g3iztdk,/r/PropagandaPosters/comments/ik1gmv/a_delusional_mirageussr_1970/g3kefwl/,False,,1611408978,2,True,False,PropagandaPosters,t5_2rm3n,r/PropagandaPosters,public,,0,[],

Only one in 10 energy suppliers globally has prioritised renewables over fossil fuels, the study finds.

Even those that are spending on greener energy are continuing to invest in carbon heavy coal and natural gas.

The lead researcher says the slow uptake undermines global efforts to tackle climate change.

In countries like the UK and across Europe, renewable energy has taken a significant share of the market, with 40% of Britain's electricity coming from wind and solar last year

But while green energy has boomed around the world in recent years, many of the new wind and solar power installations have been built by independent producers.

Large scale utility companies, including many state and city owned enterprises, have been much slower to go green, according to this new study.

The research looked at more than 3,000 electricity companies worldwide and used machine learning techniques to analyse their activities over the past two decades.

The study found that only 10% of the companies had expanded their renewable-based power generation more quickly than their gas or coal fired capacity.

Most players at the beginning will just run through the Main quest line because it gives you decent gear to start out. You can do the main quest until Valencia 1 for that or do the Kamasilvia/Drieghan Mainquest aswell for some extra gear. If you dont know what im talking about: press o and you will see all your quests, where there is a main quest tab aswell. Once you finished the main quest till Valencia, you can either start really learning the game as you can start grinding more different monster zones now especially for skill points, or you can do side quests to reach Lvl 61 ( search for a tutorial on youtube) 
For your question regarding skills: not all skills are useful, most classes have 2-3 damage skills, some buffs, some skills needed for either PvE or PvP and then some movement skills, its best to hit up a skill guide for your class to see what you need/want.
You can always reset your skills if you are under Lvl 57 or you have a ""secret book of old moon"" running(available through pearl shop or events) there is also another item that you can get that lets you reset your skills, most classes get it after doing their awakening/succession questline, but as archer is different in that regard, i cant tell you when you will get that questline.

Yes, there are lots of quests besides the main quest that you use for different stuff (side quests that give you small amounts of combat exp, daily quests for useful items, questlines with storycontent for different regions, Quests for inventory slots) Scroll a bit through your  quest tab to see more about that.
Also, many people have set their goal to reach 30000 quests, as that gives some really good items(failstacks that are quite useful for enhancing gear)

I would recommend you to play on the season servers as there you will get good starting gear easier and will also receive more info about the game. The season server will start on the 2nd septembre but you can precreate a character for extra loot. Also consider precreating a hashashin(the new class) for extra loot. 

As you can see: the game has a lot to offer and it will be a long run, so stay patient and try to have fun. As for some useful tips i can give you: patch notes and youtube are your best friend, try to use guides to find out how to do stuff and inform yourself about events giving you good loot. If you dont want to be alone, recommend the game to your friends, starting on the same day as season servers, there will be a promotion on twitch where everyone who linked their BDO account with twitch can watch BDO partnered streamers for 5 hours will get the game for free. More info on https://www.blackdesertonline.com/twitch?lang=EN

Other useful info i have for you: in every big city in BDO there is an NPC named Ellie near the stable keeper. She sells you useful items such as buff food, strong starting gear or a compass to help navigate through the desert for only 1 silver each so try finding her

If you have any other questions, feel free to hit me or others on reddit up.

Hope you have fun playing BDO

(As far as I understand but it's kind of legal mumbo  jumbo for me.   
What is here to note is that the patent runs out after some time and everyone has access to it, so at first it is established to get some of the investment for development back.   
What also people fail to mention that lots of drugs are developed at univeritys that are founded by the government and companies buy some research off of them to later profit. (yes they have more investing to do after that but it's much cheaper because it shortens their research by quite a few years).

In a few years I predict we'll see a switch in leadership who produces the most APIs because the US are not founding research as much anymore while China is steadily increasing their budget. 

If what the previous comment said was true about European countries not paying enough for reaserach then there would be no more research going on in Europe because the companies wouldn't have the founds.

Patriotism like many others said is not a ""Bad"" word.

Jinogism is like the ""bad"" version of it.

Nationalism to me is more of a political word while the other two are like behavioral descriptors.

Before I give examples I'll just say that racism does come out when people of a mono-ethnic or homogeneous country fear that they're losing their identity or whatever. Japan, China and Canada are like this. This is sold as ""nationalism"" by the gov't but can turn into racism if they're deliberately hampering  immigration from other ethnicities/races with different customs. So yes, there's is overlap but it's not automatic.

\*\*\*Examples\*\*\*

Patriotism: Waving the American flag on July 4th

Jingoism: Proud Boys behavior

Nationalism: Xi Jing Ping or Narendra Modi Behavior(changed this from North Korea)

Ultra-nationalism: Russia/Putin's policies and behavior(usually coincides with dictatorships and authoritarianism. Those two do NOT have to be present for Patriotism)

Racism: KKK

Prejudice: Trump Muslim Ban

Not to mention that NASA has more concerns than SpaceX does: they actively operate space probes all over the solar system, are responsible for astronaut training, have a lot more scientific work to do beyond just launching rockets, and they maintain public outreach and education programmes. Although developments in rocket launch systems are important, getting a rocket off the ground is only the first part of a very long and important mission to learn about the universe.

It also doesn't address other areas of research. There are no privatized institutions for high energy particle physics. Computer science (my field) has stagnated almost to a halt under the domination of the private sector and it's only because of the work of a few people like me who truly love computers and don't work for big companies that anything really important in the area gets done. I'm working on papers and processor architectures that could have been developed 30 or 40 years ago but because almost all of the computer industry is privatized and focused on consumer products it's been the same for decades.

What about my brother's research on quantum-level simulations of lasers interacting with metal plasmas? The computers he uses for that are hugely expensive and there are few to no commercial applications for it yet. What about CERN? What about intensely hypothetical stuff that lives in the far future and that's so massive in scale no private company could feasibly do it like Dyson swarms?

And on a more fundamental level, where will scientists publish their work if not for respected, accredited scientific journals, which are largely funded by universities, which are in turn largely funded by governments? And before even that, who will pay for high schools and primary schools?

Edit: I felt the need to add that where I live in Canada, university research is mostly funded by government programs like NSERC. The majority of university budgets here come from tuition and government funding, with a much smaller minority coming from the private sector. It is the contention of many academics that private companies should not be able to fund university research at all to ensure that results are unbiased, and that's a sentiment I agree with.

So,  one could see that she went in for the fame factor and the amount of $$$ he makes. 
As for Libby, she married Andrei to out do her sisters because he is attractive and very manly and he is ‚ÄúEuropean‚Äù which makes her look (in her mind) more cultured. Whenever she talks about his culture and traditions, she gets this smug face. Her tall sister married a former Danish? golf player.

So, having a hot husband while you are not so hot yourself makes up for it. I think that this is the reason why she married Andrei too.

Not the girl necessarily. 

Also, You can tell on which level their family is on.

Aside from that, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve read or at least are aware of the countless articles detailing the characteristics of Fascist rulers, and how many of them apply to Trump and not at all to a populist like Sanders. Hyper nationalism, militarism, glorification of violence, fetishization of masculinity, leader cult, lost age syndrome, self definition by opposition,  theatricality, and tendency to purge the disloyal are some of the relevant ones listed in this article:

‚ÄúAfter meeting Franco, an American journalist said, ‚ÄúHe did not give a frank answer to any question I put to him.

 O presidente, por√©m, ""tem desconsiderado as regras do modelo"", escreve Abranches em seu novo livro, ""O Tempo dos Governantes Incidentais"", rec√©m-lan√ßado pela Companhia das Letras.

 Para ele, que posiciona Bolsonaro sob o pano de fundo da ascens√£o de l√≠deres populistas em diversos pa√≠ses em uma d√©cada de vertiginosas mudan√ßas socioecon√¥micas, esse tipo de governante √© ef√™mero, o que n√£o significa que n√£o cause estragos por onde passa.

    *  

 **A aproxima√ß√£o de Bolsonaro em [dire√ß√£o aos partidos do centr√£o](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/08/bolsonaro-faz-almoco-com-centrao-incluindo-parte-dos-acusados-no-quadrilhao-do-pp.shtml) indica que o presidente passou a jogar o jogo do presidencialismo de coaliz√£o? **N√£o, porque o presidencialismo de coaliz√£o √© um modelo transacional. H√° uma troca entre governo e Legislativo no sentido de uma certa transfer√™ncia de poder do Executivo n√£o para o Legislativo, mas para os membros da coaliz√£o. E ele tem uma voca√ß√£o majorit√°ria, √© uma busca de uma alian√ßa para poder governar.

  No caso do Bolsonaro, ele foi na dire√ß√£o do Congresso em busca de imunidade, quando se sentiu amea√ßado pela quest√£o do impeachment, pelo [processo da ""rachadinha"".](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/06/extrato-de-queiroz-e-novos-cheques-a-primeira-dama-abrem-lacunas-sobre-papel-de-bolsonaro-entenda.shtml)

 Agora, na verdade, ele est√° fazendo uma transi√ß√£o do modelo autocr√°tico voluntarista para um modelo autocr√°tico populista. Por isso ele est√° lan√ßando a extens√£o do aux√≠lio emergencial. Isso ele descobriu por acaso, teve que aceitar o aux√≠lio emergencial for√ßado pelo Legislativo. A√≠ viu como oportunidade capturar o aux√≠lio para ele, e ao ver o impacto disso na popularidade, resolveu prolongar.

 Mas ele caiu numa armadilha, porque de um lado, para manter esse grau de satisfa√ß√£o que ele conseguiu com o aux√≠lio, tem que manter no mesmo plano para que n√£o haja perda de renda real. Mas tem uma limita√ß√£o fiscal, ele tem que arrebentar o teto de gastos e se desavir com uma parte do Congresso e com o mercado financeiro que o sustenta.

 **A √∫ltima [pesquisa Datafolha apontou que](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/08/aprovacao-a-bolsonaro-sobe-e-e-a-melhor-desde-o-inicio-do-mandato-diz-datafolha.shtml) Bolsonaro est√° com a melhor avalia√ß√£o desde o in√≠cio de seu mandato. Como o sr. avalia essa queda na rejei√ß√£o ao presidente? **Claramente Bolsonaro se beneficiou do aux√≠lio emergencial e est√° se beneficiando dessa naturaliza√ß√£o da doen√ßa [Covid-19]. Os EUA est√£o discutindo a amea√ßa existencial √† democracia que o Trump representa, e aqui estamos sob a mesma amea√ßa existencial, tanto da democracia como do nosso modo de vida, e a gente n√£o reage da mesma forma. N√£o h√° o n√≠vel de indigna√ß√£o e mobiliza√ß√£o e acho que nem a mesma clareza das lideran√ßas.

 Estava vendo na [coluna do Conrado [H√ºbner Mendes]](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/conrado-hubner-mendes/2020/07/a-constituicao-e-antifascista-mendonca-nao.shtml), ele discutindo esse papel da Advocacia-Geral da Uni√£o, da Procuradoria-Geral da Rep√∫blica e do Minist√©rio da Justi√ßa na [quest√£o do dossi√™ antifascista](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/07/acao-sigilosa-do-governo-mira-professores-e-policiais-antifascistas.shtml).

 Todos os tr√™s fugiram da finalidade das suas institui√ß√µes. E essa √© a maneira pela qual esse novo autoritarismo se firma, carcomendo por dentro as institui√ß√µes de freios e contrapesos e aumentando o poder discricion√°rio do presidente. Vamos ter de pensar rem√©dios para isso.

 Essa √© a quest√£o fundamental do Brasil. A gente ainda n√£o se deu conta de que tem coisas anormais demais acontecendo, amea√ßando a sociedade brasileira, o padr√£o de conviv√™ncia minimamente civilizado que a gente estava construindo, ainda com todos esses problemas que eu falei, e a nossa democracia.**‚Äã**

 **Neste m√™s, o ministro Dias Toffoli passa o comando do STF a Luiz Fux. Qual o legado que Toffoli deixa e o que esperar da nova gest√£o? **O Toffoli deu um p√©ssimo exemplo de como ser presidente do Supremo Tribunal Federal. Ele se envolveu com os chefes do Poder Legislativo e Executivo para fazer pacto de pol√≠ticas p√∫blicas, algo absolutamente impens√°vel pro chefe do Poder Judici√°rio.

 Ele vai analisar a constitucionalidade das pol√≠ticas p√∫blicas. N√£o pode autocraticamente dar um aval, n√£o pode assinar em nome dos outros dez ministros do Supremo um pacto em favor de coisa nenhuma, a n√£o ser a favor da democracia e da Constitui√ß√£o.

 O presidente do Supremo tem que manter uma certa dist√¢ncia cerimoniosa dos chefes dos outros Poderes. N√£o √© que ele deve ser advers√°rio ou n√£o ter uma rela√ß√£o cordial ou n√£o comparecer a cerim√¥nias oficiais, nas quais o protocolo diz que os chefes dos Poderes devem estar juntos. Agora, posse banal de ministro do Executivo, coisa em quartel, n√£o faz o menor sentido.

 Toda democracia precisa de um certo grau de formalismo. Ela requer certas formalidades. O presidente da Rep√∫blica n√£o pode atravessar uma rua e se sentir bem recebido, como amigo, na posse de um procurador-geral da Rep√∫blica.

 Um procurador-geral da Rep√∫blica n√£o pode sair da sede da Procuradoria e fora da agenda, √† noite, ir visitar um presidente para conversar sobre assuntos que ningu√©m fica sabendo quais foram. Isso aconteceu entre a Raquel Dodge e o Temer, n√£o √© s√≥ o Augusto Aras. O Aras entrou pela porta dos fundos, √© um caso muito pior.

 Imagino que o Fux v√° ter um comportamento mais afastado do Executivo porque ele tem mais experi√™ncia de magistratura do que o Toffoli. O Toffoli era um advogado pol√≠tico que virou ministro do Supremo.

 **Enquanto isso, Bolsonaro vem dando sinais de que pode[ reatar com seu antigo partido](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/08/de-olho-em-2022-bolsonaro-reavalia-neutralidade-nas-eleicoes-municipais.shtml), o PSL, depois do fracasso da tentativa de reunir o bolsonarismo no guarda-chuva da Alian√ßa pelo Brasil. √â puro pragmatismo tendo em vista a elei√ß√£o municipal e o fundo eleitoral do PSL ou o sr. enxerga algo mais nisso? **A motiva√ß√£o principal √© grana, √© o dinheiro do fundo, e as elei√ß√µes municipais. Porque, na verdade, essa √© a primeira elei√ß√£o que efetivamente o PSL vai disputar. Ela que vai definir se ele vai virar partido ou n√£o. Porque at√© hoje ele √© uma casca improvisada, inchado.

 A gente j√° viu isso. O PRN do Collor inchou e desinchou rapidamente. Claro que a gente est√° num processo de realinhamento partid√°rio, as bancadas perderam tamanho. Mesmo o PT, que ficou com a maior bancada da C√¢mara dos Deputados, √© metade do que j√° foi.

 Todos os partidos est√£o em teste. Os tradicionais t√™m que mostrar que t√™m capacidade de renova√ß√£o, de revitaliza√ß√£o. E os novos t√™m que demonstrar capacidade de perman√™ncia. Dos novos o que tem mais que provar √© o PSL, inclusive por isso, foi do Bolsonaro, deixou de ser do Bolsonaro, volta a ser do Bolsonaro.

 **O sr. argumenta que a onda populista j√° come√ßou a perder for√ßa em alguns pa√≠ses europeus porque √© inevit√°vel que os eleitores que os elegeram se frustrem ao longo do caminho. Mas para a democracia emergir revigorada √© preciso que, nesse refluxo, alguma intelig√™ncia pol√≠tica seja capaz de recentralizar o sistema. O sr. enxerga sinais dessa intelig√™ncia no horizonte brasileiro num eventual refluxo do bolsonarismo? **Por exemplo, o [Partido Democrata dos EUA](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/08/democratas-apostam-que-americanos-querem-o-alivio-da-normalidade-apos-anos-turbulentos-de-trump.shtml). O fato de lideran√ßas muito jovens, como a [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/lucia-guimaraes/2020/08/o-desafio-da-inclusao-e-destaque-na-convencao-democrata.shtml), e outras j√° experimentadas, como o Bernie Sanders, da esquerda do partido, se unirem para dizer o seguinte: desta vez a gente precisa de um cara como o [Joe Biden](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/08/em-discurso-de-uniao-biden-se-coloca-como-luz-em-epoca-de-escuridao.shtml), porque a gente precisa unir conservadores, moderados e progressistas contra essa amea√ßa √† democracia americana.

 Isso n√£o tem aqui no Brasil. Acho que essa intelig√™ncia tem. H√° lideran√ßas jovens, inclusive no Congresso, que t√™m essa vis√£o, que o Brasil precisa parar de ficar brigando brigas velhas e olhar para frente.

 Parar de fazer pol√≠tica pelo retrovisor, como a gente tem feito desde sempre. A gente fez a Constitui√ß√£o de 1988 olhando para o retrovisor, para evitar o retorno do autoritarismo. Era preciso que algu√©m olhasse mais para frente, mas tinha a hiperinfla√ß√£o. A gente tinha que resolver esse legado.

 A gente vem suprindo os d√©ficits do passado, lutando contra a parte negativa do nosso legado, e deixando de olhar para frente. Enquanto isso o mundo foi mudando de forma vertiginosa. Agora estamos com um dilema na m√£o. Continuamos com os passivos, porque n√£o fomos capazes de resolver nenhum deles, exceto talvez a infla√ß√£o. E mesmo a democracia estamos vendo que n√£o.

 Estamos com o desafio de construir um Brasil que seja vi√°vel no s√©culo 21 e esse desafio √© grave demais para n√£o termos nenhuma lideran√ßa entre as mais experimentadas do pa√≠s com clarivid√™ncia para ver que est√° na hora de buscar essa intelig√™n",True,False,False,,,,0,1598961859,,False,0,{},g3ksfxu,True,t3_ikizya,False,True,t3_ikizya,/r/brasilnoticias/comments/ikizya/bolsonaro_caiu_em_uma_armadilha_com_aux√≠lio/g3ksfxu/,False,,1611416287,1,True,False,brasilnoticias,t5_3a1qf,r/brasilnoticias,restricted,,0,[],

Greece has decided that a more hardliner stance of literalist readings of UNCLOS (in breach of established case law) and trying to develop and leverage allies to force concessions from Turkey is the right way forward. Cyprus' entry into the EU by way of Greek threat of EU veto is among the more successful chapters of this policy.

Turkey has decided that escalation in the face of developing infrastructure and international norms is the right way to maintain the status quo. Until this EEZ business, this had proven fruitful by keeping the status quo, at least in the medium term.

There is unlikely to be a total winner in all this as Greece's web of allies have proven fleeting in the past and Turkey's hard power shows too troubling to ignore not just by Greece but also the rest of the relevant parties.

How can a 20+ ton animals run around in full speed without knocking down every tree in their way? I don't need any advanced sensors to see the trees are being toppled over in the jungle.

&gt;They didn't have long range weapons because the people of earth didn't want them to have long range weapons.

They have rockets and missiles. Modern rockets can reach targets 8,000 m away. Animals charging in 100km/h will 4-5 minutes to cover that distance, even if they are not slowed down by craters and trees. That is more than enough time to kill them.

&gt;They weren't supposed to be an occupying force conducting a war.

Despite the fact that they have military grade mechs. If you are protecting fixed sites, you could have installed a bunch of automatic turrets everywhere instead. Mechs are used as mobile gun platforms that can move up with a large ground force, which is quite offensive in nature.

&gt;The humans only lost when a giant goddamned wall of flesh hit them and overwhelmed them.

As previously mentioned, the wall of flesh can be dealt with using rockets and incendiaries.

&gt;What modified spacecraft?

The humans in the movie can easily modify a transport ship into a make-shift bomber. Why not do the same to a spacecraft instead?

&gt;you keep looking at this from the perspective that they're a properly equipped military force

They are not completely a military force per se, however, they are equipped well-enough to handle such situation. As long as they use sensible tactics, they should have beaten the aliens. Maybe with some casualties but definitely not going to be beaten.

&gt;because the people of earth are very keenly interested in Pandora, and so are very keenly interested in not being invaders.

Not interested in a place does not mean that you want to avoid invading it. Look at the colonial empires in Europe back in 1600s-1800s. They are not particularly interested in invading a specific place but they still invade and enslave the population anyway.

&gt;Even the mine director is exceptionally interested in avoiding conflict the entire time, because he knows any conflict is going to be a PR shitstorm of epic proportions, much less open war. 

Yet they actually attacked the aliens preemptively. They (at least the military commander) decided to launch an open war with little preparation despite the fact that they have time and resources available. Sure, they are under the threat of an all-out attack.

**Platforms**: PC, PS4, BMO

**Hours**: Mostly NA On the PC side. NA and EU on the ps4 side.  

**Focus**:  Fighting for Funcle Drifter and Crazy aunt Eris‚Äôs love.

We are mostly focused on PvE but that doesn‚Äôt stop us from jumping in to some semi sweaty PvP. We are not a group of super tryhards but we also don‚Äôt like to mess around and spend hours in raids doing stuff just for the luls.

**About Us**: We're Seraphim Elite, Born in 2016, we're a community of guardians split over PC and PS4, with a clan for each platform. We have had an ongoing mission of making an active community and not just an active clan. We believe that what you put in is what you will get out. This isn‚Äôt our clan, it‚Äôs your clan. While this community is mostly centered on destiny we are a place where people can come together and joke and talk about anything from video games to sports and life in general. 

**Requirements**: We do NOT provide carries (Unless you are named Omnislash) and we don't provide welfare engrams. Being a good raider isn‚Äôt as important as being a good raid member. We really want to find people that are a good fit in our community. You will be accepted into the clan upon joining our discord but initially as a recruit. We have a process our new people go through so you can get a feel for the clan and our members before you become a full fledged Seraphim.

**Criteria for joining**

1) Be 18+ Physically and mentally 

2) Have a mic/headset. If we can hear your game or it sounds like you are playing inside a helicopter or in the middle of the freeway you will be asked to leave until you can find a proper headset.

3) Be able to communicate and listen. Be honest about your experience level.

4) Be active in **Discord** and in game.

5) No ~~fucking~~ swearing (This is a joke because some people are bad at jokes or understanding jokes. So you can swear if you want, or don‚Äôt swear I am not the swear police)

6) Speaking of jokes we like to have a good time but being edgy, or racist, or homophobic will put you on the fast track to bansville.

7) Have very strong opinions on what kind of toppings are appropriate for pizza. Also Mayo. Also hating Ohio State University (we can still hate them even though they are not playing until the fall)

So come and say hello and get to know us! We'd love to get to know you more and have you be an active part of our community. Participation in our **DISCORD** server is essential. We do check for in game and Discord activity but the requirements of this activity are minimal (speak a few times a month). We are focused on our community and building online friendships so we feel these requirements should be easy to satisfy. 

If you‚Äôre happy to join a bunch of goofs, we‚Äôre happy to have you! We‚Äôre a great set of people to run raids, sweat in Crucible, and grind new content. If all of that sounds bueno, come join up. Follow the link below to our discord server to get started, and if you can't cause the site is down please wait until it's back up to follow the link!

If you reply to this I will try to get back to you as soon I can. Your best bet to get ahold of me is to join our discord. Follow the bungie link below to get a link for our discord server

Does the best possible version of capitalism make people too comfortable and complacent to ditch it entirely? Or does the removal of some of the stress capitalism puts on us provide more opportunities (free time, access to education, etc.) for studying leftist theory and eventually pushing society further to the left?

Let me try and share the perspective of someone from a former Yugoslav country. While I'm too young to have lived in socialist Yugoslavia myself (technically I did, but only for the first few months of my life), my parents lived under that system for 50 years. Over the years, I've heard a lot about what life was like back then from them and others in their generation.

As a market socialist country, Yugoslavia was in some ways a mix of what we today call the Nordic model (market economy with a welfare state and wealth re-distribution policies) and socialism (state-owned enterprises managed by councils of workers and a one-party parliamentary system). On paper, I can imagine a Nordic model country non-violently transitioning to socialism to organize in a similar fashion.

It's important to know, however, that Yugoslavia did not arrive at socialism peacefully. It wasn't exactly a violent overthrow of the capitalist class, but it wasn't totally peaceful either. Rather, it was the result of communist partisans emerging as the local victors of WWII, having suppressed their political opponents during the war (a combination of nazi collaborators, monarchists and liberals). Tito's communists were seen as war heroes and socialist ideology appealed to the relatively poor masses, so they had an easy time securing popular support in after the country was liberated from nazi occupation.

Though the reasons why Yugoslavia failed to sustain this model and eventually broke up are complex, I think there are some lessons to be learned about the risks of transitioning from a parliamentary monarchy with a mostly agrarian market economy to socialism. I believe some of those risks could have been avoided had the country been more developed when it changed political systems. This [Jacobin article](https://jacobinmag.com/2017/07/yugoslav-socialism-tito-self-management-serbia-balkans) is a good read on the subject, so I'll quote some points I believe are relevant and that align with what I've been told about the subject locally.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Ironically, Yugoslav workers‚Äô councils tended to empower managers, engineers, and white-collar workers over the lower-skilled working class. As the councils took over complicated accounting, marketing, and management decisions, the more educated and higher-skilled workers consolidated their authority. Combined with the pressures of market competition and a commitment to wage differentials in order to secure skilled labor, self-management actually increased inequality. Goran Musiƒá, for instance, notes that wages in the early years of the planned economy ‚Äúmaintained . . . a ratio of 1:3.5. . . . By 1967, they had reached a disparity of up to 1:20.‚Äù

A more developed country that did not rely as much on low-skilled labor would have probably fared better in this regard as the difference in the level of education and type of work between workers would have been smaller. The central government could have probably put limits on differences between wages, but likely did not want to disrupt the workers self-management model too much as it was popular, at least in the beginning. In general, the Yugoslav communist party was not as heavy-handed in their policy interventions as their Soviet counterpart under Stalin. Though I generally see this as a good thing, it may have prevented them from making decisions that could have produced better outcomes.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Further, anxious not to erode their popular support, the communist leaders rejected Soviet-style industrialization and collectivization. Instead, they promoted gradual and stabilized industrial growth that required the state to restrict the flow of workers into the factories and to concentrate on building the existing labor force‚Äôs efficiency.  
&gt;  
&gt;This preference for intensive growth produced high rates of unemployment. According to Susan Woodward, in 1952, the official unemployment rate in Yugoslavia was ‚Äúat least two points above the 5 percent then considered the normal rate in Western Europe.‚Äù Thirty years later, ‚Äúthe rate surpassed 15 percent, ranging from 1.5 percent in Slovenia to more than 30 percent in Kosovo and Macedonia.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;Inequality and unemployment were not just unfortunate side-effects: self-management‚Äôs efficacy actually required them, at least in the short- to medium-term.

Again, this would have likely been less of an issue had the country been more developed to being with. High employment and efficiency could not both be achieved in parallel because it took time to educate and train the labor force for a transition to a more industrialized economy. So the country had the choice of inefficient over-employment or efficient high unemployment. Though there was a social safety net, it was not enough to allow the unemployed to live decent lives. This too may have been avoided had the country been wealthier.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;More dangerously, the regional variations in inequality and unemployment reflected the country‚Äôs uneven economic development, which grew out of the different historical legacies of the federated nations.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;In the southern republics, party-state leaders feared the turn toward the market system. The incipient extractive industries and heavy manufacturers in the south required high levels of state investment and, in the short term, greater protectionist measures. These republican leaders also supported the federal tax system, which aimed to fund southern industrial growth by redistributing profits from the wealthier northwest.  
&gt;  
&gt;In contrast, leaders in the northwest wanted to implement an export-led growth model. Consequently, they supported greater economic liberalization and integration into foreign markets. They also opposed the tax plan, arguing instead that more profitable enterprises should thrive, unhindered by state intervention.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;As external pressures intensified, the republics closed off against each other more and more. Not only did they therefore develop different specialisations with different markets in the Cold War, but superpower contestation also made the republics a primary site of the superpower struggle for supremacy. . . . The end of the Cold War presented Yugoslavia with an existential challenge that its institutional design proved ill-prepared to meet, as its debt economy found it difficult to re-finance with the threat of the USSR gone.

This issue is a bit more complex as it doesn't only have to do with uneven regional development, but also with the market pressures inherent in trying to integrate a market socialist country in a global capitalist economy. However, here too I believe that the problem would have been less severe had the southern republics enjoyed a level of development that matched the north-western ones.

After all that economic stress and the eventual death of Tito, whose charismatic leadership and cult of personality strengthened a common Yugoslav socialist identity, the federation was weak enough to fall prey to nationalist movements, many of which were later encouraged by imperialists who saw the country's break up as an opportunity to impose capitalism. Once the situation devolved into civil war and attempts at ethnic cleansing, there was no going back.

In summary, while one could fairly blame the failure of Yugoslav market socialism on nationalism, imperialist meddling and the inherent dangers of experimenting with a market-based model of socialism in a mostly capitalist world, my sense is that the country would have been much more resistant to those threats had it started its transformation from a higher and more geographically equal level of development. Yet at the same time, I'm uncertain that it would have made the move to socialism at all, had the workers felt more comfortable under a better version of capitalism.

This is just my attempt to answer this question by reflection of the socialist history of my own country, though I do not claim to be any sort of expert on the issue.",True,False,False,,,,0,1598965712,,1598966482,0,{},g3kzp16,False,t3_ikgrb9,False,True,t3_ikgrb9,/r/DebateCommunism/comments/ikgrb9/marxist_perspective_on_the_nordic_model/g3kzp16/,False,,1611419773,2,True,False,DebateCommunism,t5_2vkao,r/DebateCommunism,public,,0,[],

Tried to post this yesterday but apparently belongs here in this superthread.

Since 2017 I've really wanted to ride a motorcycle. I love driving cars, and the extra freedom from a motorcycle really appeals to me. I also recon it would bring me a lot of joy, which my life unfortunately currently lacks regularly. I love working on machines (which is only bicycles and gardening equipment at the moment), and would love to just be able to drive without a destination (which I currently can't, since I don't own a car).

A couple of months ago I finally became old enough to start lessons for an A2 license, but because of the pandemic this became impossible. I wanted to do a test-lesson to figure out if it was really something I wanted to spend my money on, but due to the pandemic you can only partake in a test-lesson if you bring your own gear (which I don't have).

Other than that I have a couple more concerns. First of all, safety. My parents don't really want me to drive a motorcycle because of the vulnerability, and I completely agree with them that you are way more vulnerable on a motorcycle. Since I am a very careful, relaxed, and already quite experienced car driver (I've worked as a chauffeur the past 2 years), I think I should be a safe motorcyclist as well. However, you are only part of getting to your destination. What are your views on the safety of driving a motorcycle? (specifically in Europe/the Netherlands).

Secondly, costs and usage. I will be studying for at least the coming 2 to 3 years (depending on my academic choices). Public transport for students is free here and it doesn't take me long at all to get to anything study related, so I won't really get to use my motorcycle regularly. I have roughly estimated the following costs for my first year of riding:

License: ¬±‚Ç¨1000  
Clothing: ¬±‚Ç¨850 (¬±‚Ç¨750 2nd hand)  
Bike: ¬±‚Ç¨3200 250-300cc (¬±‚Ç¨3800 lucky CBR500R (dream beginner bike), ¬±‚Ç¨1500 cheapy)  
Road tax: ‚Ç¨120/year  
Insurance: ¬±300/year  
Total: ¬±‚Ç¨2200+Bike (¬±‚Ç¨5400 250-300cc, ¬±‚Ç¨6000 lucky 500cc, ¬±‚Ç¨3700 cheapy)

I am able to afford it since I work a lot (for a student) and spend little, but it would consume roughly 2,5-3 years of my salary (last year earned over ‚Ç¨2500, but currently unemployed). Are these costs accurate/realistic, and what are your views on the expected low usage given my situation?

tl:dr I really wan't to drive a motorcycle. I've never (co-)ridden one. Concerned because of vulnerability. Unsure about high costs and low usage.

1. From the Harper government: **naval port/facilities building strategy** in the arctic. The two main sites being in Resolute (for all military branches, RCMP, and customs), and at Nanisivik (a deep water naval base).

2. From the Harper government, continued by current government: the **National Shipbuilding Strategy**. This project has been more recent in the news, and there was a bit of a scandal about it. Its goal is to equip the Royal Canadian Navy and coastguard with the ships needed to patrol the arctic, including the CCGS John G. Diefenbaker which will be ([if ever built](https://vancouverisland.ctvnews.ca/federal-government-soliciting-pitches-from-canadian-shipyards-to-build-new-icebreaker-1.4833554)) the newest and most powerful icebreaker in Canada.

3. The best thing we can do to strengthen our case is to grow our presence in the arctic and get the Americans on side for enforcement help.

Issue is not all functions have a Zen code path yet. See:

https://github.com/pytorch/builder/issues/504

The later also shows an more complex workaround for Linux based systems. It seems that Intel is actually officially implementing functionality for Ryzen. So let's give them the benefit of the doubt.
 On my Ryzen, all basic numpy tests are faster with MKL 2020 than with OpenBLAS, some are a lot faster.

Not sure we can really blame intel. Vendors are to blame as well as AMD, especially on windows. On linux it's fairly simple to get an OpenBLAS alternative or compile yourself. Good luck with that on windows in a corporate environment with little control.
Vendors like Mathworks (matlab) or continuumIO (anaconda) should by default offer a choice which BLAS to use. Especially with windows the situation is dire as many packages simply are not available as OpenBLAS build.

Last but not least AMD should simply invest more in their software. It's their main achilles heel. Their BLIS isn't great and only Linux, their CUDA alternative isn't great and only Linux. No own x86 compiler like intel, many missing software features for their GPUs.

Leaving aside the fact that you're referring to the country's (previous) administration as ""not mine"", the evidence does not appear to support the conclusion. Here are some excerpts:

From [1] which, to note, is an op-ed:

&gt; In fact it was Trump ‚Äî not Obama ‚Äî who ordered the closure of Russian diplomatic properties in San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and New York City that appeared to be a threat to American security.

This is misleading as the article cites a piece by NYT [2] that clearly states the following:

&gt; The administration‚Äôs response had been expected for the past month, since Russia ordered the American Mission to cut its staff by 755 people ‚Äî a sign of its displeasure after Congress imposed sanctions because of Russia‚Äôs meddling in the 2016 presidential election.
&gt; 
&gt; President Trump has kept his distance from the dispute. He expressed gratitude, rather than anger, toward Mr. Putin when was asked about the Russian president‚Äôs action to reduce American diplomatic personnel.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúI want to thank him because we‚Äôre trying to cut down the payroll,‚Äù Mr. Trump said, ‚Äúand as far as I‚Äôm concerned, I‚Äôm very thankful that he let go a lot of a large number of people, because now we have a smaller payroll.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Putin‚Äôs move was also a delayed reaction to President Barack Obama‚Äôs expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats and his seizure of two Russian diplomatic compounds last year. Mr. Obama was acting after American intelligence agencies concluded that Russia attempted to influence the 2016 election. The administration said there was no decision on whether the Russian government would be allowed to take back those facilities.

Here's another claim from the op-ed:

&gt; In August 2017, Trump signed a bill slapping even more sanctions on Russia ‚Äî this time specifically aimed at the country‚Äôs energy and defense industries. Congress made the legislation Trump-proof, meaning that no executive order could ever undo such sanctions; yet Trump signed it anyway.

This excerpt cites a piece from CNBC [3] which states the following:

&gt; Trump and his secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, had expressed concerns about the sanctions‚Äô possible effects on U.S. relations with Russia. The administration has pushed to improve relations with Moscow but has gotten tripped up by the probe into Russian attempts to affect the election and whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin. 
&gt; 
&gt; In a statement after the signing, Trump said he wanted to ‚Äúpunish and deter bad behavior‚Äù by North Korea and Iran. The president wanted to make ‚Äúclear that America will not tolerate interference in our democratic process.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; However, Trump argued that the measure ‚Äúencroaches on executive power, disadvantages American companies and hurts the interests of our European allies.‚Äù Trump needs congressional approval to roll back sanctions under the measure. 

The Washington Post op-ed by Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK) [4] also appears to make some misleading claims with regards to the Pentagon budget. I have not fact checked the entire article however owing to a lack of time so please excuse me on that front.

&gt; More broadly, under Obama, the Pentagon‚Äôs budget was slashed by 25 percent from 2010 to 2016.

This cites a report by the Heritage Foundation [5] that states the following:

&gt; In total, since FY 2010, the defense budget, including overseas contingency operations (OCO) spending, has been cut 25 percent in inflation-adjusted dollars.[10]
&gt; 
&gt; FY 2010 and FY 2011. While the FY 2010 budget slightly increased the defense budget, the department began cancelling major programs that year. For the FY 2010 budget, the department announced:
&gt; 
&gt; - Cancellation of the F-22 Raptor fighter aircraft;
&gt; - Cancellation of the VH-71 presidential helicopter;
&gt; - Cancellation of the vehicle portion of the Future Combat System;
&gt; - Cancellation of missile defense programs, including the Airborne Laser and the Multi-Kill Vehicle;
&gt; - Cancellation of the CSAR-X search and rescue helicopter; and
&gt; - The end of C-17 Globemaster III military transport production at 205 aircraft.[11]
&gt; 
&gt; In FY 2011, the cuts focused on modernization spending:
&gt; 
&gt; - Ending C-17 production at 223. (Congress blocked the first attempt.)
&gt; - Cancelling the F-35 alternate engine program.
&gt; - Cancelling the CG(X) future large cruiser.
&gt; - Cancelling the Navy‚Äôs EP-X future intelligence aircraft.[12]
&gt; 
&gt; In some cases, these cuts were necessary because the program requirements were not a high priority or because the program was too costly. On the other hand, other cancellations have led to serious problems for the military today.

Note that this is also somewhat contentious as this is fails to take into account the fact that the (then) administration started pulling out of Iraq and was also bipartisan, as stated in a fact check by Politifact [6]:

&gt; **Has the military budget dropped under Obama, and if so, who is to blame?**
&gt; 
&gt; Overall spending on national security includes the Pentagon budget as well as spending by other agencies, such as the Energy Department‚Äôs work on nuclear weapons. Spending increased in 2010 and 2011, but it has fallen every year for four years since then by a cumulative 15 percent.
&gt; 
&gt; Other ways of looking at the question show declines as well. National security spending made up 20.1 percent of the federal budget in 2010, but in 2015 it was 15.9 percent. Over the same period, spending fell from 4.6 percent of gross domestic product to 3.3 percent.
&gt; 
&gt; There are two main reasons for the spending drop. The first is the Obama administration‚Äôs decision to start removing U.S. troops from Iraq and Afghanistan. The second has to do with a process known as sequestration.
&gt; 
&gt; Sequestration refers to the framework for automatic, across-the-board cuts to both military and non-military spending that were originally designed to force bipartisan negotiators in Congress to strike a deal in 2011. When negotiations fell apart, the cuts went into effect.
&gt; 
&gt; The bipartisan nature of the sequestration provision means that both parties merit a share of the blame, experts say.
&gt; 
&gt; The most recent Obama budget proposed a 7.8 percent increase in the base Defense Department budget between 2015 and 2016. The spending bill enacted this fall puts the defense budget on a path to start growing in fiscal year 2016, up about 6 percent from the previous year.
&gt; 
&gt; ""It‚Äôs still not quite as much as the president requested, but it‚Äôs much closer,"" said Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Bottom line: do you have any sources which come from foreign policy experts which I could use? I'm not saying you're wrong but simply asking for better data to examine your claim.

Secondly, while that does play to your points, to me giving the pre-Christian Norse a stamp of ""not being Westerners"" plays into current far-right versions of Norse reconstructionism, such as groups that consider the West 'decadent' and wish to return to 'traditional' values.

Thirdly, this all hinges very much on a perspective that Catholic = west, which while true in the sense that Western Europe *was* Catholic also carries the implication that religion somehow 'westernises' (going from how you use the phrase, as a way to ""civilise"" the ""uncivilised"") people, historically speaking. That is not the case, or otherwise Johannes Gezelius the Younger would not have described the (now catholicised) Finland ""a land of scorpions and barbarians"". He clearly viewed Finns as uncivilised people, despite their religious affiliations being Catholic aside of Eastern Finland where Orthodoxy reigned supreme (but in the days before nation states, religion deemed nationality so such Finns were labelled as Russians).

Rather, light cavalry was becoming more and more common from the 15th century because of the appearance of gunpowder weapons. Armor, which was and still is extremely expensive, offered ever lesser protection against ever more advanced firearm. Then came the thirty year wars which was the final nails in the coffins for heavy cavalry (at least in my opinion). A common theme of the thirty years war was the inability of state to get enough funding to raise troops, much less to fund them: Wallenstein was a mediocre commander but he was the guy who could make a lot of money to raise a lot of regiment, therefore he became the ""best"" commander of the Imperial force for quite sometimes. Heavy cavalry was expensive and was no longer effective on the battlefield as Francis I learned it the hard way at Pavia. Therefore the old heavy cavalry were subjected to drastic cost cutting and changes in tactic and equipments: they were less armored, carried gun, rarely used the big ol' lance. This had turned them into cuirassiers. And no, they did not forget any light cavalry tactics from before. Light cavalry had always been the staples of European armies ever since Numdian riders shoved their javelins up the Roman's bum hole. Italians fielded Stradiots (who I view as close relative to the Croat), Spain fielded Jinetes, Crusaders used Turcopoles, Polish fielded Uhlan. They had used light cavalry for a long period of time

As for the Croats and a lot of other frontier forces (Russian Cossacks, Hungarian Pandurs, Bosnian Grenadiers...) these guys brought not so much new tactics or equipment to the table. The Croats were quintessential light cavalry. You could basically give a Mongolian horse archer from 13th century an arequebus and a lobster tail helmet and told him to speak Croatian and he basically became no different to a Croat rider of thirty year wars. What made a Croat different from his compatriot was his upbringing: he was brought up on the border zone where life was a constant uphill battle even by medieval standard. His family would be dirt poor, 9/10 of his siblings would die before they reached 10 years old due to every reasons from a simple cold to some Tartars cutting them to ribbons. He would face his first fight at very young age even by the era standard and by the time he was a grown man he would become a hardy veteran not many could match. This experience honed his skill as terrific fighter. He could go on for days in the cold, live off the land, know whether there was an ambush up ahead, scout the area for routes and ambush. This made him absolutely excellent in his role as a light cavalryman whose main task was to scout, forage for supplies, harass the enemy.",True,False,False,,,,0,1598972658,,1598973449,0,{},g3lhcqx,False,t3_iklbma,False,False,t3_iklbma,/r/WarCollege/comments/iklbma/what_was_the_role_of_irregular_light_cavalry/g3lhcqx/,False,,1611428204,12,True,False,WarCollege,t5_39t8u,r/WarCollege,public,,0,[],

De novo, pergunto: qual o problema de essas pessoas ficarem no centro da cidade, e n√£o em qualquer outro lugar? Qual o problema de construir moradia popular na Paulista ou na Faria Lima ou no Leblon ou onde quer que seja? Qual o problema de eu preparar uma sopa ou coisa que o valha pra popula√ß√£o de rua e distribuir no centro da cidade, em um bairro nobre, ou onde quer que algu√©m precise?

The basic idea is that depicted in Fitz Ballantine's Royal Parchment Scroll of a Black King Alpha and Black Queen Omega. It is an idolization of race, with an emphasis on Europeans/""Whites"" being evil. I have even encountered blacks in real life who have told me, without mincing words, that whites are literally Satan. These ideas of black supremacy have so infiltrated the collective African-American consciousness (and even the European-American consciousness for that matter) that it is hard not to see them as having a part in the racial conflicts we are currently witnessing.

In Rasta, they appear as harmless seeds, but as we know in Scripture, [the enemy has sown weeds](https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-24.htm) in the field. Black pride quickly leads to black supremacy, just like any national pride leads to an inflated idea of superiority.

Cherishing your ethnic heritage, having ""roots and culture"" is one thing, but hating on another ethnicity to define your culture is called racism.

How does history conflict with any of this? Many big names of Jamaican reggae all share anti-white views, to the point where it is inculturated into the music itself. Even Bob Marley is propped up as an idol of black supremacy, but he was half-white! Talk about [too much confusion](https://youtu.be/cdcfrl83zaY)!

A key trait of Rasta is its Judaizing elements, and this has carried over to black culture. Black ""Hebrews"" are the most vicious form of this trend, but they were of course predated by black Muslims and the Masonic-Moors. The emphasis is on a *racial* superiority, likened to, or equated with, the Israelite people. In this regard they totally throw out the Gospel and focus on the Old Testament: how many black people have you met who say they don't eat pork? It's gotten out of hand!

Let's look at Biden's policy proposals:

* $15 minimum wage - this is clearly something progressives want

* Mandatory 12 weeks paid sick and family leave - not sure why progressives wouldn't like this

* Public Option and reduce Medicare general eligibility from 65 to 60 - these are steps towards MFA and are a huge deal for expanding affordable coverage to tens of millions of people

* Federal negotiation of drug prices (like many European countries do) - I work in public health and this is a big one for reducing healthcare costs

* Actual action on climate change including net zero carbon from power generation by 2035 and rejoining international agreements

* Increase corporate taxes and increase the top tax bracket rate on the wealthy

* $640 billion investment in Housing Trust Fund, $100 billion low-income housing tax credit, $15k tax credit for first-time home buyers and Section 8 housing expansion

* Increased public school funding

* Criminal justice reform and police reform

I guess I look at that and though I can understand why people want Medicare For All instead of a Public Option, many of those things look like the sort of things progressives would be very happy with. I mean it's certainly a more progressive platform than Obama ever put forward. I'm of course fine with marijuana legalization but to me it's a much less important issue than many of the proposals listed above.

I would also say that if someone is truly in a position where they are threatened by Donald Trump's administration, they are probably pretty likely to support Biden.

It's all about the way you look at it and one's own experiences.  I'm sure there are some shitty situations in Denmark, too.  It's probably not as warm as I'd like it to be, either.

So you're saying that the US is very accepting of immigrants?   Well that's not what the news media thinks.   From my experience, it is.  My parents were able to get here on an emergency visa when Iran's political situation turned grim and I was by default a US citizen when I came along several years after they arrived here.   They worked hard, had a welcoming community, and were able to be successful.

The US really is the land of opportunity.  However, that doesn't mean that the opportunity is as easy to get.  I had to work my ass off to get scholarships. I didn't have a trust fund.   I worked and got what I could, took out a loan, and then worked and made good decisions to live modestly and within my limits.

You also need to look at the attitude of the US versus other European-like nations.  They're more collectivist while the US is individualistic.   The US actually had a bloody war with its colonial overlords going to individual rights of people.   

The US was, and still is, the land of opportunity, which means that there isn't a government system there that plucks you up.  No, you're going to have to reach for it.  Even after that, you're going to have to make good choices.  It's about individual choice rather than the collective population holding everyone up.   That makes people stronger and think for themselves.

As I said, we do have some problems that we can fix.   I don't fully agree with the price of medical care here compared to what it is in other nations.   I don't like the government subsidizing student loans which cause an inescapable amount of debt while causing tuition rates to skyrocket disproportionately to wages.

In my own words, ""dhyana"" is just the naked state of being, which is what the Zen Masters were talking about. (As MaZu put it: ""Your ordinary/original mind."")

According to Wiki, ""Dhyana"" comes from the Proto-Indo-European root of ""dheie-"" (""to see, to look,"" ""to show"") and later morphed into ""dhyƒÅ (""to contemplate, meditate, think""). Regardless, it's all the same thing.

It is an evolution from what just become apparent to some people, long, long ago.

""Clear vision""

Anyway, in China, ""dhyana"" came to be referred to as ""ch'an"". 

The character, Á¶™, also has an interesting etymology. 

Apparently, it is a [""Phono-semantic compound""  of Á§∫ and (phonetic) ÂñÆ.](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%A6%AA)

Á§∫ comes from [the pictogram of an altar](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%A4%BA#Glyph_origin) and the semantic root [""to show""](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%A4%BA#Etymology_1); and ...

ÂñÆ, although phonetic, comes from the pictogram of a [net to catch animals.](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%96%AE#Glyph_origin)

Makes me wonder if the sanskrit [""yana""](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yana) might have a similar relationship to ""dhyana"" ...


Anyway, the Chinese used the character ""Á¶™"" to speak of ""dhyana"".

BodhiDharma, whoever he was, was at least from the yogacara tradition. 

The Zen lore claims direct lineage to Buddha.

Thus, either or both of these provide a direct link to the tradition of ""dhyana"" as well, it's not just a borrowed name.

And so ... ""Zen"" = ""Ch'an"" = ""Dhyana"" = ""Just a name for ordinary mind"".

As mentioned above, even when ""dhyana"" came about, it was an abstracted label from a personal and real experience.

The rest is just history.

""Ch'an"" became ""Zen"" and *""Zen""* was the term used to import the ""dhyana"" teaching to the West.

Once a few people in r/zen started to actually read the texts, and realized that ""Zen Buddhism"" was full of shit, ""dhyana"" was rediscovered once again.

The name has just been a moniker all along ... plus, this subreddit was not founded upon a legitimate understanding of Zen either ... it evolved into that.

So, ""Zen"" in 21st century American English on an internet forum seems just as good a term as any to just ""slide"" into.

It's like ... when I speak Italian, I call ""Rome"", ""Roma"" ... I don't call it ""Rome"" ... but the inverse is true when I'm speaking English ... I don't suddenly just whip out a trilled-R ""Rrrrroma!"" in the middle of my discourse. (Interestingly enough, that's how you can spot the wannabes).

What's the saying? ... *""When in Rome ... !""*

So for the LoL World Championship this year, the Vietnamese teams (2) won't be able to attend because of Covid-19 precautions. The typically 24-team tournament will now be left with only 22. After the news broke last night, there's been much speculation over the rumor that NA and Korea would get an additional team, bringing them up to 4 along with China and EU.

But instead, Riot has decided that they would rather reformat and reschedule their entire tournament around an uneven number of teams (in terms of head-to-head brackets, 4 groups of 4 for the main group stage) instead of pulling in a few extra teams. They even say themselves, ""**we were unable to find a format that would allow us to run a double round-robin for this many teams and still give teams the chance to compete in a best-of-five series for advancement**"" which is practically an admission that even *they* can't figure out a standard format with the number of teams they have.

And. I don't know. Obviously I get that it's such an unenviable position to be in. I'm just so genuinely shocked that they'd rather turn their biggest tournament of the year into a weird, confusing mess instead of pulling in two extra teams and being done with it.

Anyway.

No, as I say none of this is to say that independence is a bad idea - it's just going to be more painful now that it would have been then

As the UK continues to trade with the EU, sure. But there will have to be checks at the border, so there will be delays. And tariffs, if we do end up in that situation with the EU. Small beans in individual terms, but a big impact across the economy. Same thing as the EU/UK argument. Probably logistically easier without the Channel, but still a new problem compared to 2014.

The SPD being socialist pre-WW1 and pre-USSR is irrelevant. With the rise of authoritarian communism (‚Äúcommunism‚Äù) they rebranded themselves as social democrats, and pledged their full support to the Weimar republic. When you look at Iron Front propaganda of the time it literally says ‚Äúagainst Thalmann and against communism.‚Äù You can argue that was targeted at authoritarian communism only but I don‚Äôt think your average German would care. They did not support a complete societal change as the KPD did.

And you claim they used ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù in their propoganda/campaigning- could you cite an imgur link or something? As far as I could find from there were no instances of this that remotely overlapped with the time of the NSDAP. Which, I‚Äôll remind you, is the only relevant timeline- neither the SPD nor KPD can be blamed for the rise of Hitler before the NSDAP existed, obviously.

And the NSDAP absolutely included ‚ÄúSozialistische‚Äù in its name to appeal to socialists, though it was a very ‚Äúredefined‚Äù version of the word. They had a large left wing, which the KPD repeatedly tried to win over. After all they didn‚Äôt refer to socialism as the ultimate enemy but rather ‚ÄúJewish Bolshevism.‚Äù The SPD, on the other hand, attacked all forms of communism, which is why I‚Äôm confused about your claim that they used socialism in their propaganda. Is it possible you‚Äôre referring to the American left‚Äôs definition (socialism is when government does good things) and not to the stepping-stone phase between capitalism and communism?

My point is that the SPD was not ‚Äúsplitting‚Äù the communist vote. The only sense in which this works is to say that, had it not been for the SPD, people would have voted for the KPD, but I disagree and say that as supporters of liberal democracy they would have voted for the Zentrum. You could argue the SPD was splitting the democratic vote, but that‚Äôs another story.

&gt;With all due respect this is ridiculous, Luxemburg and Liebknecht were members of the SPD just a few years prior...

Yes, and they broke off with the other Spartacists. Anyone in the SPD at that point was aware it was the establishment party of the Weimar republic. Rosa and Liebknecht were democrats up until when they tried to start a revolution with base support of only ~10% of the populace.
 
I‚Äôll cut to the chase and get to the base of your argument/belief system. You believe that it was entirely fair and just for the KPD to view liberalism democracy as equal harmful to Fascism, which as I said is irrelevant to discussing who did more to enable the Nazis and only serves to justify why the KPD enabled Nazis - somehow, even though the Nazis were openly in favor of restoring Germany‚Äôs former borders by force, ‚Äúif necessary,‚Äù the KPD figured a democratic (not monarchist) government would find itself in another WW1 sooner or later. I won‚Äôt really argue this belief, because, like I said, it doesn‚Äôt really change what we believe happened, just the reasoning behind it. 

Your second big point is that, had the SPD embraced the revolution its members truly wanted (which, as I‚Äôve discussed, members of the SPD did not) Germany could have been a successful communist project. Now, there are not many revolutions (not civil wars between two regions but revolutions) that succeeded without the majority support of the population. You cite the Russian civil war - this was a case of people fighting for whoever gave them food and didn‚Äôt kill them. Where the White army had control was where they were able to promise food and protection, where the Red army had control was everywhere else. Sure, the success of the civil war convinced many of the merits of communism, but the revolution was only supported because the alternative was to starve. And of course plenty of people starved anyway, but idk how much of a USSR apologist you are so I‚Äôd rather not bother arguing about the Holdomor.

The other revolution you cite is the French revolution. I‚Äôm not nearly as well-read on it but it‚Äôs my understanding the majority of peasants did support it beforehand. And, again, people were starving.

There was no point in the Weimar era where a revolution could have succeeded except for when people were still starving and penniless after WW1, and a revolution was attempted, and failed. The closest the Weimar republic came to being ripe for one was when the depression hit, however then people were not dying of hunger in the street. And even had a revolution been attempted, the militant wing of the NSDAP was extremely powerful already and could have easily siezed power simply by putting it down.  

And furthermore, you say that the KPD were committed democrats. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard this talking point before, but the French revolutionaries - hell, most left-wing revolutionaries - supported elections post-revolution as well. Every time they have  win, it ended in an authoritarian regime, and this is exactly what the members of the SPD feared. 

To be honest I‚Äôm not really sure the KPD really expected to be treated like a party committed to democracy, seeing as they were a member of the Internationale led by a fully authoritarian government.


Now onto my thoughts about the current election. I‚Äôll try to explain why I‚Äôm supporting Biden, and why I would support him even without the hindsight of knowing what damage Trump has done.

Having lived in Germany (German high school is where I learned a lot of what I‚Äôm talking about) I got to see firsthand what capitalism can look like. Populism was limited, and as a result real evidence-supported policies had allowed Germany to advance economically to the point where they could truly guarantee their citizens would be healthy, safe and able to pursue happiness. The same is true across much of Europe. 

This is what Biden, and most democrats, have been working towards their whole lives. It doesn‚Äôt involve just taking billions from billionares - Europe has plenty too - nor does it involve creating a single-payer healthcare system - Germany has a reasonably large private healthcare industry - nor does it involve abolishing a military. Rather, it involves reforms that have been proven to work, like public healthcare options (like the one Obama and Biden tried to pass), better tax systems (Sweden, for example, has relatively low and simple income taxes but a high added value tax) and cheaper education (Biden has promised to subsidize college near-fully for anyone who can‚Äôt afford it). This is what I believe in-bloodless transition into a system similar to that of much of the EU, which can spread its wealth and democracy via capitalism.",True,False,False,,,,0,1598984301,,False,0,{},g3mdf2p,False,t3_ik1by6,False,True,t1_g3m065x,/r/ABoringDystopia/comments/ik1by6/history_repeats_itself/g3mdf2p/,False,,1611443608,1,True,False,ABoringDystopia,t5_3c6l1,r/ABoringDystopia,public,,0,[],

O que fiz foi tratar da nacionalidade do meu filho atraves da Conservatoria dos Registos Centrais em Lisboa. Enviei toda a papelada para Lisboa pelo correio e eles trataram de tudo.

Quando recebi a confirmacao dos Registos Centrais que atribuiram a cidadania portuguesa ao meu filho (isto pode demorar um par de meses...), tive de ir ao Registo Civil local onde me passaram uma declaracao (nao me recordo do nome) que permitiu ao meu filho passar a fronteira e ir a Portugal tratar do Cartao do Cidadao, etc...

O meu conselho e continuar a tentar entrar em contato com o Consulado em Londres, mas ao mesmo tempo ligas a linha de apoio do Registo Central (+351 211 950 500), explicas a situacao e eles dao a informacao que necessitas.

1) For the love of god, use the enter key and add paragraphs.  Your wall of texts is *REALLY* irritating.

2) Making it out of groups does *NOT* make you one of the 8 best teams in the world.  Not all groups are created equally, look at the SKT, RNG, FNC group from last year vs the group that Splyce made it out of.  If you're arguing that Splyce was a better team than RNG then I have nothing else to say to you.

3) I never said NA couldn't make it out of groups.  I was commenting on the OP's absurd fiction of 4 NA teams not only making it out of groups when only 1 time have more than one gotten out of groups, but to have them ALL advance to the semifinals for an all-NA top 4.  I'm sorry, but zero percent chance.

&gt; To me its just everyone is already saying they lost before they even try.

That's what happens when a league is clearly at a lower skill level than the international competition.  It's like comparing an NBA team to an NCAA team or one of the European basketball leagues, or comparing an MLS soccer team to a Premier league football club.  There just isn't a realistic level of competition there, and while that doesn't mean the less skilled region could *never* compete the fact of the matter is that they have basically no chance of winning worlds because that requires a sustained level of performance.

&gt; what happens if the meta that we play in na this year happens to be the meta that worlds shifts to. right there is one small instance where na would have a really good shot at making it out.

Give me even *one* example (since s3) where the NA meta was ever in line with international competition.  The problem isn't one of play-style, it's a problem of both mechanics and communication/macro.  Do you honestly think even a favorable meta is going to allow an NA team to beat G2 in a best of five?  The C9 team from two years ago that was a *really* good roster got demolished by FNC and didn't win a single game in a meta where everything had been upended and no one knew how it was going to go.  That's your best-case scenario.

&gt; and i still didnt see any post about the so called washed up people in it for the paycheck that i listed.

It's not even worth going through the list, why would a top-tier talent capable of playing on one of the better teams in EU move to NA to play in a less competitive region domestically and a weaker region internationally?  In addition, most of the people who were still good enough to play on a decent roster (Febiven and Kobbe to name two recent examples) both went to NA and said it was *AWFUL* and made them significantly worse players... both of who came back to EU and immediately had significantly better performance.

It isn't all just ""washed up"" players though, it's people who just aren't good enough to get on a decent EU team like Jizuuke, Nisqe, PowerOfEvil, Froggen, and Broxah (who I think is actually good, he just wasn't getting on a team the caliber of FNC or G2).

So the thing about Antifa is that there is no group ""Antifa"". There are certain political ideologies or tendencies that are very against fascism, and believe that it is necessary to directly oppose the right wing in liberal capitalist states like the USA so that these states don't end up going over to fascism. Considering the consequences of fascism in the past, e.g. the holocaust, you have to admit that they have a point that that's at least as valid as hardcore anti-communists.

It turns out that ""othering"" a group of people does tend to band them together. For instance, in the New World before European contact there were lots of groups, tribes, and states of indigenous people who saw themselves as unique, and often fought each other. In the 20th century, a political trend called the ""American Indian Movement"" showed up, which argued pretty successfully that indigenous groups had the same issues and problems in common because of white colonialism (until the US government stepped in: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Indian_Movemet#Informants_true_and_false). So, when people present evidence of ""Antifa Plans"", ""Antifa Groups"" and ""Antifa Agents"", keep in mind that this evidence exists because they were looking for it.

That leaves us with the question ""Why do people want to turn antifa into a group?"". The answer is that it's a natural side effect of right wing political ideology. Antifa is hated because far right ideology is common in the USA.

Well for one, the notion of a European society didnt really exist back then, and it doesnt even really exist now (outside of a political notion, and even thats sketchy e.g. Brexit). 



Secondly, interest groups are part of assimilation. Assimilation is a 2 way street. 


Thirdly, In the U.S. (and other countries for that matter), assimilation generally entailed bringing your culture as well. The Germans for example brought aspects of their culture that got ""Americanized"" like Christmas trees, hot dogs etc. Which we do see happening incidentally for Somalis.

Meine, unausgereifte, Idee sieht in etwa so aus, dass die EU eine gemeinsame Armee auf die Beine stellt, die nur der Verteidigung dient (und ggf. Katastrophenhilfe und √§hnliches innerhalb der EU). 

Ein wichtiger Aspekt dabei ist, dass ein gro√üer Wert auf Freiwillige gelegt wird, die das f√ºr ein, zwei, drei Jahre machen. Sie werden da in der Landesverteidigung geschult und w√§ren im Notfall recht schnell Abrufbereit. Aber eben nur zur Verteidigung der EU innerhalb der EU, sie m√ºssten sich keine Sorgen machen in Kriegseins√§tze im Nicht-EU-Ausland hineingezogen zu werden. 

Gleichzeitig k√∂nnte das zur europ√§ischen Integration beitragen. Freiwillig Dienende werden ins EU-Ausland versetzt und lernen dort die Sprache. Die Leute werden europ√§ischer und k√∂nnen im Folgenden auch besser zusammenarbeiten.

Neben dieser reinen Verteidigungsarmee g√§be es dann noch eine Armee mit reinen Berufs- und Zeitsoldaten die sich auch explizit f√ºr Auslandseins√§tze bereit erkl√§rt haben.

W√ºnschenswert w√§re es evtl. diese beiden Armeen strikt voneinander getrennt zu haben, so kann man ""ohne schlechtes Gewissen"" in der Verteidigungsarmee dienen ohne das Gef√ºhl zu haben in gewisser Weise auch Auslandseins√§tze gut zu hei√üen oder gar zu unterst√ºtzen. Inwiefern das m√∂glich ist, m√ºsste man aber noch schauen.

I'd been there a year when I finally met Mr. Murphy, who was trying to get the door from the garage to open with a key card he admitted he hadn't used in 'forever'. I walked him through to the building manager who recognized him immediately.

While she got a new card ready we got to chatting and I asked why I never saw anyone in his offices. ""Success"", he says. His customers had once been a bunch of small local manufacturers, but now he was in the big leagues.

It would be more than a year before I saw Mr. Murphy again, and when I did, boy.

Eu as aplica dupa al 10-lea an de viata al masinii un impozit progresiv, fiecare an in plus, +15% la impozitul pe masina, asa ca pe la anul 15 de viata al masinii sa nu mai fie atat de tentant sa iti cumperi un second hand cu drept de vot.

Prost prost foarte prost. Adica masura asta este excelenta pentru orasele mari (sa zicem ce e peste 70.000 de locuitori). Ai transport in comun, te poti folosi de el. 

De»ôi, masina nu e doar ca mergi cu ea 5 km pana la munca. O folosesti si sa mergi la mare, la munte, la strand, intr-un oras in care faci un city break. In mod ideal, ai avea transport in comun pe care l-ai folosi in calatoriile astea, trenul mainly, dar in Romania de multe ori optiunea asta cade, din motive binecunoscute. 

Totusi, daca stai intr-un oras mic, mediu (gen 30k) si stai la vreo 3-4-5 km de centrul orasului ai nevoie neapƒÉratƒÉ de ma»ôinƒÉ ca sa mergi la munca, la cumpƒÉrƒÉturi, sa duci plozii la scoala sau cand se intalnesc cu prietenii lor, etc. Pentru ca transportul in comun intr-un oras de genul e pus la pƒÉm√¢nt. Ca sa nu mai zic de ce se intampla pe sate. Hai ca din corbeanca sau floresti ajungi usor in bucale sau cluj, dar din lunca bradului mai greu ajungi la reghin. 

Si romanii nu au atatia bani sa isi permita masini noi sau aproape noi (pana in 10 ani). Asa ca mi se pare o prostie sa le interzici oamenilor sa nu mai aiba masini (ca practic aia ai face cu masurile alea) cand ei depind de ele. 

Nici nu am vreo idee c√¢t e impozitul pentru o masina in medie. Ma g√¢ndesc ca o fi undeva la 1500 de lei pe an.

**Who are we:**

We are primarily located in NA, with a few members in Europe. We primarily come from PS4, and have just full transitioned into a PC clan. We pride ourselves on being helpful, and accepting, but also having a good time and a lot of fun.

**What are we:**

We are a group that tries to help each other out, and have a good time doing it. We are, at the fundamental level, a group of friends, who games together in destiny, and in other games!

**When and how to do we play?**

We usually play in the afternoon and evening (any time from 6pm until really late eastern) but can, and do play outside of those peak hours. We play all aspects of the game (Raids, Crucible, Dungeons, etc.

**Who are we looking for?**

As it stands now, we are a clan of around 35 players. We are and are searching for specific types of players, namely people who share in our vision. We want to create a community where everyone, regardless of skill level, or how much they are able to play, is able to achieve all of their goals.

By joining Nevermore, you are a person that wants to find a home where you can have fun, while still getting all the loot your heart desires. But you also want to help others out, and join the community as an active member - both in game, and on our server.

**This sounds great, How do I join?**

If we sound like a good fit for you, the first step is to reach out to me. You can do so either by replying to this post, or sending me a DM. Then, you will have to join up in our discord server. Once there, you will be given time to explore our server, and get to know some of the clan members. Once the admin team is confident that you will be an active enough member, and you feel like we are a good fit for you, you will be pulled into the clan itself.

&gt;Then you've got how he encouraged countries and regions to specialise in a few key products, often primary produce, and become dependant on the USSR, rather than encouraging them to be self-sufficient. A genuine socialist country can't be imperialist, but you'd got social-imperialism most notably towards Cuba by that point.

formed in 1949 the COMECON focused on joint planning and making sure Eastern Europe would not be dependent on the USA

Unlike imperalism which underdevelops and blocks development in the third world the Soviet relationship with Eastern Europe was beneficial, in 1960-73 the average GNMP (the Socialist version of GDP) in the six COMECON Nations in Eastern Europe was almost double that of Latin America in the third world and it was also almost double that of the United States furthermore growth was almost identical to that of the USSR (what strange colonies indeed!)

&gt;Seems they had a good system under Stalin.

They did, their productivity problem stemmed from the fact that their investments in the economy focused more extensively on expanding the existing means of production and not on introducing new techniques, the problem was made worse by an extreme shortage of labor because they lost so many people in World War II and population growth had slowed

(Also Khrushchev focusing on light industry to create a ""consumer Paradise"" as seen in the west completely forgetting that such ""consumer Paradises"" are built on the backs of billions of virtual slaves in the colonies did not help)

I've been having a very good time playing these recently. They're technically JRPGs, but I probably spend like 90% of my time reading text/cutscenes. The previous game, Trails of Cold Steel 3 (Sen no Kiseki 4), had a translated text length of equal size to all 7 Harry Potter books combined. My vocabulary and read speed has had notable gains getting through both of these games. There's text backlog too, which is the real godsend for playing games in Japanese.

Difficulty wise, this is probably at least N2+ at the minimum, though I'd still probably recommend N1+ if you want to have a somewhat smooth experience. Vocabulary wise, it's a wild mix of economic, political, military, fantasy, and a lot of more ""literary"" words that you wouldn't use in normal day to day life (I'll find an opportunity to use Êï£ËèØ eventually). Grammar wise, the setting of the game isn't modern Japan, but in a fantasy Europe (?) like continent, so styles of speech and grammar patterns aren't necessarily the ones you'd always expect to hear compared to media that takes place in modern Japan. 

I've been at N1 level for years now, but I came out of Cold Steel 4 with a pretty sizable spreadsheet of words that I looked up on aedict (even if I know the word, if I felt like checking just in case I always add it to the vocab list on the app). If I could find a way to share a Google Sheets without showing any personal information, I'd be willing to share my vocab sheet. Some really dense sections of dialogue ended up being pretty time consuming to get through due to both vocab, grammar, and wanting to be doubly sure I understood due to it being really plot relevant. My play time ended up being 150 hours for a game that's in the 90-100 hour range from my understanding.

As for why the games are fun, that conversation is more fit for /r/jrpg but the short of it is that this game series (Legend of Heroes) has probably the most detailed/well realized world out of any video game. It's also probably the longest running directly continuous canon out of any video game. The story and events build naturally on top of the extensive world building the writers do, which makes it fun to see what happens next.

First of all you are comparing a modern Albanian dialect to a name that is 3000+ years old. 

Second, there has been some considerable effort by scholars to find Indo-European origins to the name (and Afrodite as a goddess). So if a connection to an Indo-European language like Illyrian or a later local proto-Albanian dialect could be plausibly be made, it would have been made. 

Third, the cult of Afrodite was probably imported to Greece from the Middle East. Ancient writers tell us so and archeological evidence also points to that. It's very plausible that the name, if not Greek, comes from a semitic language (btw naming the planets with the gods of beauty, war etc also seems to have been imported from the Babylonians. That would make naming the goddess with the Albanian equivalent of the planet's name even more implausible)

Fourth, the ancient Greeks didn't hesitate to give credit to other civilizations. They mentioned getting the cult of the goddess from the Phoenicians. If the name was Illyrian they would have known so (there were Greeks who knew Illyrian) and would probably have said so.

No. It was because he was successful in every scheme and plan he had executed leading to his reign over the galaxy. 

That's why he decided to use the unfinished full of weak points death star? Or that he gave the rebels the real plans that showed them the way to the reactor?
He was definitely not ready on Endor and a genius would not be overconfident just because his plans in the past succeeded because of luck and the enemy being stupid.

Turkish migration into Anatolia never becomes a serious issue, and instead the Turks spread into Iraq and Syria, possibly forming new Turkish kingdoms there instead.

The Taurus Mountains were an amazing defensive barrier, it was difficult for anyone to really permanently conquer across them. The Turks were able to do it by migrating their population across, but otherwise I dont see anyone else conquering Anatolia from the South or East. The Mongols were the only power I could see doing it, but historically the Mongols and Byzantines got along fairly well. I think Anatolia remains unconquered.

No Turkish invasion means no call for help from Alexios to the Pope means no Crusades. Western Europe doesn't seize on a holy mission to liberate Jerusalem, and doesn't develop as much of a taste for Middle Eastern goods. That has plenty of major and minor changes that are outside of my scope to answer.

With Anatolia remaining strong and no Crusades, we have no Ottoman push into Europe, no seige of Vienna, and no spread of Islam. There is a patchwork of states in the Balkans dominated by the Austrians, Byzantines, and probably Russia or the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. When the Protestant Reformation happens, the Orthodox Church probably plays referee between the factions.

So there we have it: a relatively stable Byzantine Empire holding Greece and Anatolia while occasionally engaging in various wars and imperial actions. They probably dont have much of a role in colonialism, if it happens similarly. The Empire stands as a shining example of autocracy and absolute rule throughout Europe. Over a millennium of precedent and tradition pass live on in the Empire.

All that tradition and autocracy, however, eventually becomes too much to bear. The Byzantines don't industrialize as quickly as Western Europe, but it does eventually. At some point a millennium of tradition and privilege becomes too much and the people of Byzantinium rise up in revolution.

Federalist Paper No. 29 (Hamilton) ""It requires no skill in the science of war to discern that uniformity in the organization and discipline of the militia would be attended with the most beneficial effects... This desirable uniformity can only be accomplished **by confiding the regulation of the militia to the direction of the national authority**. It is, therefore, with the most evident propriety, that the plan of the convention proposes to empower the Union ""to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, RESERVING TO THE STATES RESPECTIVELY THE APPOINTMENT OF THE OFFICERS, AND THE AUTHORITY OF TRAINING THE MILITIA ACCORDING TO THE DISCIPLINE PRESCRIBED BY CONGRESS.'' (Sorry for the shouting, but the all-caps are his, according to the [Yale source](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed29.asp) where I found the original text. Boldface emphasis is mine, not in the original.)

tl;dr: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist\_No.\_29](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_No._29)  


Another example: [Federalist No. 46](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed46.asp) (Madison)

(speaking of how state militias could defend themselves against a federal army:) ""...a militia amounting to near half a million of citizens with arms in their hands, **officered** by men chosen from among themselves...and **united and conducted by governments possessing their affections and confidence**. ... Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation\*, **the existence of subordinate governments, to which the people are attached, and by which the militia officers are appointed,** forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of. ...were the people to possess the additional **advantages of local governments** chosen by themselves, **who** could collect the national will and **direct** the national force, and of **officers appointed out of the militia, by these governments**, and attached both to them and to the militia, it may be affirmed with the greatest assurance, that the throne of every tyranny in Europe would be speedily overturned..."" \[Emphasis mine, not in the original.\]

So Hamilton and Madison recognized that regular citizens would be armed, and did not have a problem with that, as you say. But they did not leave it up to the random citizen to decide how to conduct himself ‚Äî state governments and militia officers are repeatedly mentioned.

But the facts and statistics speak for themselves. The more a country provides help, doesn't make things harder for homeless/drug addicts (which we do by giving them a criminal record, and or fines), and its made clear drugs/mental health shouldn't be stigmatised, the fewer simply-just-don't-give-a-fuck people you get in a society or see on the streets. 

Sure, you're never going to eradicate it completely, and all the support in the world won't save some people. My issue is I think there are a lot out there who *did* want help, or are probably slipping into it right this very moment, but aren't getting it - then five years from now they're just another person ""content with living in filth"" and all that matters to them is their next needle. A bit of compassion and understanding when people are on a downward slope can go a long way - but as a society I don't think we provide that - and when they're at the very bottom and are on the streets scaring people or being abusive, then it's hard to find any compassion or get them into a position where they'll stick with any help.

The UK has had a *massive* problem with drugs for years now. 1/3 of drug overdoses in the entire UK come from the UK, and the usage statistics are even worse.

Did it, though? Sorry, that's a bit of a jump for me. A lot of people think that the colonists simply went native. I'm sorry to interject like this, but that term is loaded with a great deal of unintentional prejudice - namely, the idea that not living in a European style is a failure. I do not think you mean ill by it, but I do think that we can do better and teach it better.

In this case, I would instead suggest asking, ""What if Roanoke remains an active European colony?"" In this case, I think you get a few notable ripples:

1.In terms of English politics, there's a remote chance that Sir Walter Raleigh is too distracted/powerful to participate in the Main Plot (or, perhaps, too powerful to prosecute as openly and severely as IOT). It's a minor tweak of the balance of power, but one that might have resulted in more power to the monarchy in the long run...maybe.

2.What's more definite is that Raleigh doesn't have the excuse to go looking for survivors of Roanoke, and thus does not engage on his expeditions to find El Dorado. This would hamper English meddling in South America and possibly allow Spain to more effectively hold Guiana/Guyana. This changes the balance of power between the European powers somewhat, although...

3.Given his rocky relationship with James I, I don't see it impossible that, if he had a successful colony in America, he might not just say ""screw you guys"" and start his own little kingdom in Roanoke especially if it has begun to flourish. If so, that obviously reduces English power in America and potentially hampers further colonial exploits. 

4.For all that, though, I'm not sure how much changes with the indigenous population. Jamestown will still happen as it did, unless Raleigh decides to go independent and then courts Jamestown to join him. The Powhatan will still do as they did, and native relations will go south in a hurry as they did. You'll end up with relative antagonism, and even if Roanoke and Jamestown are not of the same country they'll still be culturally similar and thus maintain the Plymouth/Jamestown dichotomy which starts some of the differences between North and South in the US.",True,False,False,,,,0,1599009949,,False,0,{},g3o2wf3,False,t3_ikvvcs,False,False,t3_ikvvcs,/r/HistoryWhatIf/comments/ikvvcs/what_if_roanoke_didnt_fail/g3o2wf3/,False,,1611473361,1,True,False,HistoryWhatIf,t5_35koa,r/HistoryWhatIf,public,,0,[],

Quite the opposite in fact. Most states DO have positive rights. Lots of them. Can you even name one state that doesn't?

Sorry, may have been unclear. Many states give lip-service to positive rights in the same way that the CCP pretends to be communist. For example, its very common for European nations to declare healthcare a right. However, I can't name an example where it is actually protected as a right. The logic being that if healthcare is a right, and I as a doctor fail to provide you a prescribed level of healthcare (with or without compensation) than I have violated your right to healthcare. As far as I know there aren't any nations that protect this idea in practice, and so their support in theory is little more than air. Australia, for example, has a public option for healthcare, but it is not a right. You cannot force anyone to give you healthcare.   


&gt;Also, like I said, if a government is enforcing your right to be left alone, say, by criminals, then that is a positive right. So by defintion most states would have positive rights, and I don't really see it as accurate or helpful to say we ""lose"" rights when we have positive ones. Do criminals lose rights because of the police? Yes, they do, but is that a bad thing? I don't think negative rights are able to be argued as inherently right, or better than positive rights. 

One would have the right to be left alone even if it wasn't enforced by the government, especially if they could enforce it themselves. Its just a lot easier for the function of society if we have the government aid in that defence. 

Yes, criminals lose their rights. Because no magical force exists to protect the rights of individuals they must be protected with force or with the consent (social contract) of those around you. Criminals lose their rights to self-determination when they refuse to respect the same rights in others.  If healthcare were actually ever practised as a right, anyone with any medical expertise would be losing their right to their own labour - as they would be required to provide healthcare.   


&gt;What I am saying though, is that the only way a government can even save your negative rights, is by violating others, and creating positive rights. 

Perhaps the error is mine. I may have poorly explained the dichotomy. Negative rights can exist in the absence of others, positive rights cannot. So I have a negative right to pursue healthcare at all times, but I require others around me to have the positive right to a specific kind/type/instance of healthcare.

&gt;Also, thank you for the reply, but you didn't really explain why property is a right. What makes something yours? 

A product of natural law I suppose. At some point everyone had what they had because they could keep it. When we moved on to negative/positive rights it was largely decided that everyone had what they had now, and if you want what someone else has you need their permission to acquire it.",True,False,False,,,,0,1599010713,,False,0,{},g3o4a8l,False,t3_ikqjsl,False,True,t1_g3o16o0,/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/ikqjsl/i_made_this/g3o4a8l/,False,,1611474045,3,True,False,PoliticalCompassMemes,t5_3ipa1,r/PoliticalCompassMemes,public,,0,[],

Your first airsoft gun is the most important purchase you will make in airsoft. As your only weapon it must be **versatile**, **reliable**, **affordable**, reasonably high-performance, easy to work on, and compatible with as many accessories and upgrades as possible. This means buying an Automatic Electric Gun ('AEG') assault rifle or Sub-Machine Gun ('SMG'); **forget about sniper rifles, pistols, gas guns and other restrictive exotica** until you have more money, more experience, and at least one backup weapon.

System Component | Comment
---|---
Primary Weapon | An AEG assault rifle or SMG.
Magazine | A high-capacity ('hi-cap') magazine can replace numerous medium-capacity ('mid-cap') magazines, and many AEGs are supplied with one. For more information, reply 'airsoftbot magazines'.
Battery | You should have at least two. For more information, reply 'airsoftbot batteries'.
Battery Charger | You may also need a battery tester/balancer.

Again, most airsoft sites will rent you a weapons system, so you don't need to purchase your own until you're ready to commit to airsoft.

Which model of airsoft gun you purchase depends, in decreasing order of importance, on your **budget**, your **location**, and your **preference**. It is important that you understand that small budgets force you to choose from the small range of affordable guns that are not absolutely terrible. We will always recommend that you purchase the best gun that your budget will allow, rather than the cheapest gun that you can get away with: in airsoft, you get what you pay for. Good intermediate guns are better made, higher performance and longer lasting than budget or beginner alternatives. Your location may impose rules, or affect pricing, in a way that makes one gun better than the other. Your preference will be the choice between the guns that best fit your budget and location.

Commonly recommended choices include:

Make &amp; Model | Approximate Price | Comment
---|---|----
CYMA TM-Clone AK | $100 | CYMA's CM028 and CM028S are clones of the original TM AK-47 and AKS-47, and include a hi-cap magazine. These are the cheapest AEG we recommend, and are generally considered reliable, upgradeable, and reasonably versatile. However, their all-Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene ('ABS') plastic construction makes them relatively fragile. For improved robustness we strongly recommend spending slightly more to purchase a Glass-Filled Nylon Polymer ('GFP') AR-15 or a steel AK. To see a loadout built around these guns, reply 'airsoftbot budget loadout'.
CYMA VFC-Clone AK | $150+ | CYMA's VFC-clone AKs are generally considered reliable, reasonably robust, and good value for money. AKs are generally tougher than AR-pattern alternatives. An intermediate equivalent of these would be an LCT or E&amp;L AK. For more information on loadouts built around these guns, reply 'airsoftbot noob ak loadout'.
G&amp;G [Combat Machine AR-15](http://guay2.com/en/product-3-15-14-1) | $140+ | G&amp;G's CM16s are the gold standard of beginner airsoft guns. Built from a surprisingly tough GFP, CM16s are reliable, affordable, accessible and therefore absolutely ubiquitous. If possible, purchase one without G&amp;G's somewhat unreliable electronic trigger control system. An intermediate equivalent of these would be a G&amp;P or ICS AR-15.
Classic Army Polymer AR-15 | $185+ | Classic Army's GFP AR-15s are a relatively new entry to the market, and are equivalent to a slightly upmarket version of G&amp;G's CM16s. An intermediate equivalent of these would be a G&amp;P or ICS AR-15.
Tippman Commando | $160+ | Tippman's GFP AR-15s are a relatively new entry to the market, and are equivalent to G&amp;G's CM16s. An intermediate equivalent of these would be a G&amp;P or ICS AR-15.
Apex Fast Attack | $125+ | OEM'd by Classic Army, Apex's Fast Attack AR-15s are a relatively new entry to the market, and are equivalent to G&amp;G's CM16s. Versions with GFP and metal receivers are available. An intermediate equivalent of these would be a G&amp;P or ICS AR-15.
ICS [CS4 Sportline](http://www.icsbb.com/product-category/electric-gun/electric-gun-cs4/electric-gun-cs4-sport/) | $190+ | ICS' Sportline AR-15s are effectively a re-shell of their excellent regular guns in a GFP receiver. They retain the convenient split gearbox system of the regular guns. An intermediate equivalent of these would be an ICS AR-15.
Specna Arms CORE | $130+ | Largely restricted to the European market, Specna Arms' CORE series of GFP AR-15s are considered to be reliable, robust, and good value for money. Many players now recommend these over CM16s, to which they are roughly equivalent. An intermediate equivalent of these would be a Specna Arms AR-15.

&gt;#Summary
Recently, a number of predominantly German studies have questioned whether driving an electric vehicle emits less green house gas, or wether we must wait for electricity to decarbonise further.

&gt;This report explains these studies have a number of flaws and that proper calculations show electric vehicles already emit less than half the green house gasses of their fossil fueled counterparts.

&gt;If we speculate about a future in which production and driving are done on renewable energy this results in at least ten times less emissions than what is achievable with combustion engines using fossil fuels.

&gt;What follows is a list of the six biggest mistakes in studies that find electric vehicles have similar green house gas emissions as fossil fueled counterparts. The summary concludes with a match up in terms of CO2 emissions of electric vehicles versus fossil fuel vehicles in different segments.

&gt;**1 Exaggerate GHG emissions of battery production**

&gt;Scaling up and smarter engineering (e.g. preserving heat in the manufacturing process) have dramatically lowered the energy that factories require to produce battery cells. At the same time the electricity used is steadily decarbonizing. All this is reducing the EV's 'climate backpack' but many EV-critical studies ignore this.Examples are Buchal, Karl and Sinn, ADAC, √ñAMTCand Joanneum Research that assume battery production will emit175 kg CO2 per kWh of battery. They base this on one highly controversial study from 2017. But this study was updated in 2019 and concluded it was now 85 kg CO2 per kWh of battery which halves the 'climate backpack' of the electric vehicle. Mazda published a paper in 2019 using even older numers. Based on a list of recent publications we assume a range of 40 to 100 kg/kWh with a mean of 75 kg/kWh.

&gt;**2 Underestimate battery lifetime**

&gt;In many studies the battery (e.g. Buchal, Karl and Sinn, ADAC, √ñAMTCand Joanneum Research) the battery is assumed to last only 150 000 km. Buchal, Karl and Sinn even contrast this to a diesel car lasting 300 000 km. However, we have not seen examples where this was based on actual research. Empirical data shows modern batteries will most probably last for more than 500 000 km. New studies claim two million km is possible with current technology. Furthermore, car lifetimes are increasing in Europe and an average modern car can be assumed to last 250 000 km.That is the battery lifetime assumed in this report.

&gt; **3 Assume electricity will not get cleaner over the lifetime of the car**

&gt;All studies that find high EV emissions assume the electric vehicle will drive on the electricity mix it used in its first year. This is understandable since it makes calculations easier and avoid shaving to defend assumptions on developments in the electricity mix. However, it is also unrealistic. Just as the electricity mix has changed dramatically over the past 20 years,it will do so again over the next 20 years.We extrapolate past developments and support our estimates using authorative sources in order to create a future time series containing developments in the electricity mix. This basically means EVs drive cleaner as time goes on. However, this positive effect is partly negated by the fact that cars drive less as they get older. Furthermore, we must add upstream emissions of electricity because of e.g. digging up coal, electricity grid losses which we estimate to be higher than most literature at around 30%. All in all electric vehicles sold in Europe in 2020 should count on 250 g CO2eq/kWh electricity over their lifetime.

&gt;**4 Use laboratory tests paid for by manufacturers themselves**

&gt;Measuring CO2 emissions of cars is deeply problematic in Europe because the official numbers have become political instead of empirical. The test protocol is defined in political negotiations with manufacturers who then choose and sponsor the institutions that conduct the tests for them. This resulted in the succesful application of cheating software and even fully tests using the New European Driving Cycle (NECD) result in emissions 40% lower than reality. Most studies that are critical of EVs still use the NECD. The new WLTP is supposed to be a fresh start but doesn't address any of the aforementioned underlyingproblems so improvements are limited and -we fear -temporary. The WLTP is still useful for determining compliance but should not be be confused with empirical measurements of actual CO2 emissions.In this report we use road measurements (from spritmonitor.de) and independent test measurements with a good track record (from the EPA in the US).

&gt;**5 Exclude or downplay fuel production emissions**

&gt;New research into flaring and other sources of GHG emissions has shown that the emissions related to the production of gasoline and diesel are larger than previously thought. In order to account for the production of fuel, cars driving on gasoline should add 30% to their tailpipe emissions. Cars driving on diesel should add 24%. Emissions per litre are thus 3310 g for diesel and 3140 g for gasoline.

&gt;**6 Ignore the larger system**

&gt;The improvement that can be achieved with combustion engine technology is limited. First because it is a mature technology that only sees small incremental improvements. Second because producing the fuel combustion engines need in a sustainable manner is relatively inefficient and expensive.If we abide by the Paris agreement, the entire supply chain will become low carbon. Predominantly through the use of renewable electricity which will also be used for industrial heating processes using power-to-gas. This means that the 'climate backpack' of both conventional and electric cars becomes very small. What remains is the CO2 emitted while driving. Here the electric vehicle can directly run on renewable electricity and also has the advantage of its on average four times more efficient engine.The end result is that an energy system with enough renewable electricity will lead to electric vehicles that emit at least ten times less CO2 than cars driving on gasoline, diesel or natural gas.",True,False,False,,,,0,1599012143,,False,0,{},g3o6vx9,False,t3_ikt9xd,False,False,t1_g3n898o,/r/technology/comments/ikt9xd/electric_cars_indirectly_emit_much_less_carbon/g3o6vx9/,False,,1611475337,162,True,False,technology,t5_2qh16,r/technology,public,,1,[],

Agreed! My only issues are:

1. When delivery address has changed. I get that it's my responsibility to let companies know I've moved, but thinking about a game company I placed an order with two years ago isn't quite as top-of-mind as gas, electricity, bank etc. To NISA EU's credit, they are CHECKED before sending to see if anything had changed. More of this, please; **and/or**
2. Companies using pre-orders as a quasi-Ponzi schemes for risk-free, interest free working capital, and embedding poor customer outcomes through a combination of terms and conditions and customer FOMO. Not mentioning any names here. Again, NISA EU did not bill be until the order was ready to ship.

Hard to say with concrete numbers, but they are visibly less right now because of Covid and also tighter entry laws for Indian citizens.

&gt; Are they still coming or did the government do anything to stop this problem? 

The Govt (about a year ago) introduced a rule that you can only get a visa-on-arrival as an Indian citizen if your are permanent resident of a few developed countries (like EU, US) or visa from one of those countries, if not, you need to apply for a visa at the embassy. This policy change of course has lessened Indians coming, who before could simply get a 120 visa on arrival and as a ""tourist"" indefinitely renew their visa. Though, I haven't seen information that the indefinite tourist visa renewal has been removed. Indians will still come (tourists, students, and people wanting to migrate) but it's going to much tougher for most now.

&gt; How is the demographic situation in Yerevan? Do you notice a lot of these foreigners there? 

During the summers in the center, yes. Many of the foreigners though are tourists. During the off-season months I wouldn't say one sees so many foreigners, and if you do, most of the time they are tourists. I'm sure in Tbilisi one sees more foreigners everyday that are living there. 

&gt; Are there a lot of non-Armenian immigrants coming from other countries besides India? 

Not really, before Persians were the main non-Armenian immigrants and also many tourists, but their numbers have decreased. 

&gt; How does the average Armenian feel about this problem, especially given the fact that Armenia has a small population and mass immigration would cause a major disruption? 

I'd say many Armenians reacted negatively to the influx of Indians which you could say saw its ""peak"" before the visa rule was changed. The Indians themselves, many were fooled into coming to Armenia promised lucrative jobs or passage to Europe or even thinking Armenia is in the EU. Also, Indians were sometimes hired without being registered by Armenians, which mean undercutting wages of Armenians and not paying the proper taxes for workers. A few Indians were successful in setting up some businesses, but for the most part the dynamic of all that was not good, and I really hope the Govt closes the door on such migration. Indians have for a long time come as students and that is fine, and maybe even if you have a few professional Indians in the IT sector that come for a work program, that could be fine, if filtered carefully, but the type of unimpeded and reckless migration that was taking place before was quite dangerous and bad for Armenia.

""By 1980, Moscow was spending $44 billion a year on its allies (Keeran and Kenny, 2004). It gave $4.5 billion in aid to Warsaw from August 1980 to August 1981 alone to help contain the US-supported Solidarity movement (Schweizer, 1994). Meanwhile, the war in Afghanistan was draining the Soviet treasury to the tune of $3 to $4 billion per year. In other words, the costs of sustaining allies had grown enormous..""



""..in August 1981 Brezhnev informed his pal that after three consecutive poor harvests in the Soviet Union, Moscow would have to shrink oil deliveries to the GDR. State Planning Chairman Gerhard Schurer implored his Soviet counterpart, Nikolai Baibakov: ""I assume that a healthy, stable, socialist GDR plays an important role in the strategic thinking of the USSR. Imperialism stands right at the door of our house with its hate on three television channels."" In addition, said Schurer, complaining of the independent trade union Solidarity, ""now we have counter-revolution in Poland at our backs."" He begged for 3.1 million tons more fuel. ""Should I cut back on oil to Poland?"" Baibakov asked rhetorically. ""Vietnam is starving. We have to help. Should we just give away South East Asia? Angola, Mozambique, Ethiopia, Yemen... we carry them all.""


""Again, clients proved more of  a drain than an asset. The enormous foreign aid effort was consuming 2 per cent of GNP by the early 1980s. Wherever communism was established in the Third World, the Kremlin clung to the doctrine that it should be rendered irreversible and was prepared to squander resources to try to ensure the longevity of converts. In turn, the clients greedily exploited their patron for  subsidies,  which  meant  that their backward  economies  were  never weaned off assistance. Cuba, a Kremlin ally since the early 1960s, was by far the largest recipient, claiming around $6 to $9 billion a year in Soviet aid. Nor,  generally,  did  the  Soviet  Union  pay  any  less  than  Western  market economies  for  imports  of  raw materials  from  favoured  Less  Developed Countries. Indeed, by  1989  the  Soviet  Union  was  left  to  rue  the  fact  that non-European socialist states owed it 45 billion transferable roubles while ‚Äòfriendly‚Äô Third World countries owed a further $79 billion, most of which debt was not recoverable (Janos 2000, 332).""",True,False,False,,,,0,1599016062,,1599016721,0,{},g3oduc4,False,t3_ikih21,False,False,t1_g3mtoxt,/r/ShitLiberalsSay/comments/ikih21/edgy_casual_racism/g3oduc4/,False,,1611478824,8,True,False,ShitLiberalsSay,t5_2ukze,r/ShitLiberalsSay,public,,0,[],

That still doesnt qualify as genocide. Not being as fecund as other groups or bringing in immigrant labour isnt genocide.

Whatever you want to call it, it isn't voluntary.

&gt; And you believe there is some conspiracy to control the populace? What for?

There is nothing crazy with the idea that people would group together to promote their own interests. You can use the word 'conspiracy' to stigmatize it, but it is a completely sensible idea. 

Moving on from that theoretical point, there are organizations that promote Jewish interests and these organizations have influence over our society; whether it's groups like the ADL (re: internet censorship), AIPAC (re: foreign policy), and so on. Beyond that, when Jews have influence, they use it to promote their own interests, which is why the over-representation is important. (In contrast to Whites today, whose power is used largely to accelerate the destruction of the White race!). 

&gt; What interests do they have that you believe conflict with yours?

Resentment towards Christianity and Europeans for historical reasons; support for multiculturalism both out of that resentment and out of a desire to feel safe (if Jews are one of many minorities, they feel safer; if they are the only visible minority, then they are inevitably going to stick out like a sore thumb), and support for liberalism in general. When I say liberalism I don't mean 'support for the environment' or 'protecting workers'. I mean the broader ideological concepts like opposing '''authoritiarianism''', opposing family values etc.

They literally sponsored a study several decades ago, shortly after WW2, called The Authoritarian Personality. The basic idea was: ""We don't want the Holocaust to happen again, so let's look at all the things that correlate with support for fascism and try to nip those in the bud"". And basically all of those things they have spent the entire post-war world undermining, whether it's a wholesome, homogeneous culture, parental authority, high-investment parenting, etc..

If you believe in narratives about White supremacy and White privilege and systemic racism, what is implausible about what I'm saying?

You already believe:

1. Groups can advocate for their interests;
2. People can have 'racist' views towards people that are not in their group;
3. People can internalize views that are against their own interests (e.g. women internalizing sexism, minorities internalizing racist views they were taught from a '''White''' culture, etc.).

There is nothing a priori absurd about anything I've said. 

Not only that, but I cannot understand how it doesn't make intuitive sense. Let's say Whites are in charge. Why would we allow everyone to shit on us constantly? Why would we engineer our own demographic replacement? Why would we make it taboo for us to defend our own interests? If Whites *aren't* actually in charge, then you have to admit: it does resolve all these problems (and it explains why you're not allowed to criticize Jews but you *are* allowed to say whatever you want about Whites).

&gt; How so?

A simple example would be immigration contrasted with foreign policy. The pro-White position is don't invade the middle east and don't let them invade us through immigration. The Jewish position is that we ought to crush all of Israel's enemies, and then as a side benefit, the people fleeing from this devastation get to flood into White countries. Jews get to appear compassionate for supporting the rights of Muslims, but in practice, the entire reason they are fleeing their countries is wars that were done for the benefit of Israel. 

Integration vs. separation is debatable but I do believe that black Americans would have been better off had they been given reparations and greater cultural autonomy in the 1960s instead of simply passing Access to White people legislation and forced integration (busing, etc.).",True,False,False,,,,0,1599017421,,1599019279,0,{},g3og4fy,False,t3_iimbhr,False,True,t1_g3oaydu,/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/iimbhr/what_does_your_vision_of_utopia_look_like/g3og4fy/,False,,1611479969,1,True,False,AskTrumpSupporters,t5_3cr3o,r/AskTrumpSupporters,public,,0,[],

This was 312 less than the previous year and 901 fewer than in 2011. The majority of victims were men (65%).

The assault-related death rate stood at 0.7 per 100 000 inhabitants in 2016 and has been on a steady decline since 2011 (when it stood at 0.9 deaths per 100 000 inhabitants).

**Assault-related death rate highest in the Baltic States, lowest in Luxembourg**

In 2017, among EU Member States, Latvia registered the highest rate of death related to assault at 3.8 deaths per 100 000 inhabitants. Two other Baltic Member States, Lithuania and Estonia, followed with 2.8 and 2.3 assault-related deaths per 100 000 inhabitants respectively. Malta and Romania ranked fourth and fifth-highest, with 1.6 and 1.5 deaths per 100 000 inhabitants respectively.

At the opposite end of the scale, Luxembourg recorded the lowest rate of deaths due to assault (0.2), followed by Germany and Ireland (both 0.4), France (2016 data), Italy and Slovakia (the last three each registered a rate of 0.5).

**Regional patterns for assault-related death rate**

When looking at regional data (NUTS2), Mayotte and French Guiana in France were the most affected regions with 5.3 and 4.3 assault-related deaths per 100 000 inhabitants, according to 2016 data (2017 data are not yet available). These were followed by Madeira in Portugal, which recorded 3.4 deaths due to assault per 100 000 inhabitants in 2017, Central and Western Region in Lithuania (3.3 deaths per 100 000 inhabitants in 2017) and North-East in Romania (2.6 deaths per 100 000 inhabitants in 2017).

[],,[deleted],,,,,,,dark,,,,,[],"For one, the canon of the Bible is a local affair. Each local community kept the books it personally received as inspired. After a while there was more uniformity, because smaller churches would look at what the bigger and main church in the region does, so for instance, in the region of Western Europe, instead of having as many canons as there are local churches, the local churches checked what the head church of that part of the world (the Church of Rome) did and they did the same thing. This principle applied to every other patriarchate as well, although not always.

Then in the Eastern Orthodox churches, a council was held in 692 in Constantinople (the Council in Trullo, considered part of the 6th Ecumenical Council) and, among other things, it recognized several distinct lists of books from the 4th century. The point was to show what is acceptable, not to put all these canons as a single one, but in practice this is what happened. This is the list of books you will find in the Orthodox Study Bible.

The Oriental Orthodox churches still have many different canons. 

I don't think there's specific canonical/critical texts. The Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople uses the Patriarchal Text of 1904 for the NT but nothing specific for the Septuagint. There is a critical edition of the NT of the Peshitta, issued in 1905 by the United Bible Society, but I have no clue if the Syriac Orthodox Church and the Assyrian Church of the East use it.

Think about how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up with good ol' American hot lead. Basilisk? Let's see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes. You aren't looking at it--you're looking at a picture of it.

Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12.

And have you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.

Now I know what you're going to say: ""But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!"" Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies). But which is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger?

Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova.

Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill. I don't think Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after something like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope you have some Essence of Dittany for that fucking chest wound.

I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick his cigarette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series:

1) Your first source is utterly lacking in rigid scholarship. It first claims that Marx, in the essay ""Mathematical Treatment of the Rate of Surplus-Value and Profit"" that Marx argues that the rate of profit could move in any direction. And that on face value is true. But then he says this eliminates the falling rate of profit altogether. Putting aside the fact that just because Marx said something doesn't make it right, he also just straight up misrepresents Marx. Marx, in that very same document, says that while counter-tendencies to the falling rate of profit exist (gutting union protections, cutting taxes, lowering wages, etc.) in the long run it's untenable because once wages are as low as they can possibly get there is no respite from falling profit. Hence why he called it a TENDENCY. It won't be a straight line going down, it'll be a broad trend towards falling profit. The last thing this blog says is that Marx's theory more closely resembles Keynes in that he concludes that ultimately, aggregate demand and the business cycle have far more to do with the crisis than the TRPF. I will agree that he's partially right, in that Marx and Keynes agree on the surface level about the apparent cause of crises being lack of aggregate demand, but whereas Keynes attributes this to the Animal Spirits, Marx attributed it directly to structural decrease in demand. Heinrich critiques this idea as being absurd because ""if the workers were able to buy the product, then there would be no profit."" Aside from this being horribly simplistic, to some degree... Heinrich lays out the exact point Marx is making. If the worker is unable to pay for the product, then they must be having surplus value extracted from them, validating the Law of Value and thus the TRPF. So Heinrich is in a double bind, he either needs to accept the underconsumption theory crucial to Marxist crisis, or he needs to buy Marx's profit formula and invalidate the TRPF consequently. 

I'm not going to refute the profit squeeze theory, because it's dumb and refutable and not what I'm defending, but Heinrich is correct to say that it contradicts under consumption. It's also not what Marx argued for. In conclusion, in spite of being told I will receive theoretical and empirical reasons to reject Marx, I have been given logic inadvertently proving Marxist crisis theory and nothing which contradicts the TRPF as empirically demonstrated by UMass.

2) I'm gonna focus mainly on the articles this links to Heinrich, since that's far more comprehensive, and then touch on the empirical data.  The first general critique is that the ""counter-tendencies"" of Marx's TRPF make it un-falsifiable. Aside from that being utterly untrue, as no Marxist in their right mind thinks counter tendencies could persist for thousands of years, it's just not accurate. Between 1978 and 2008, accounting for rising exploitation, there has been a relatively steady 2.3% consistent fall in the rate of profit. But that's neither here nor there.

Heinrich goes on to argue that the profit equation disproves the TRPF because the increase in productivity necessarily increases the rate of exploitation of surplus value... Which is flat out just wrong because he clearly lacks a genuine understanding of Labor Time. Productivity increases doesn't leave all things equal to expand the rate of exploitation, it necessarily reduces the amount of labor time per unit. That necessitates less labor, consequently more machine labor,  and thus a fall in the rate of profit. To put it in a more pressing and clear manner: full or even partial automation of the US economy would DRASTICALLY reduce the number of jobs available to workers because of just how little labor would actually be needed to keep machines running. In such a world, where wages are near non-existent, demand is literally as low as it could possibly be. As we approach such a future, the rate of profit necessarily must fall as a result of this process.

Heinrich goes on to refute that argument by saying that it would only be true if the amount of capital necessary to employ a small number of workers in an automated economy remained the same as a large number of workers in a non automated economy. The problem is that Heinrich still doesn't understand labor time. Labor done by machines cannot yield surplus value because they represent dead labor, they only have the ability to reduce labor time that must be employed by a firm. So when a firm is reducing the amount of labor time they need through increases in productivity, they aren't retaining the same surplus value they previously had or even expanding the capabilities of a given amount of labor time (in a net sense) they're cutting down on labor time as a component of capital.

And, from a cost analysis, while I agree that costs for wages would go down because machinery would take the place of the prior workers, Heinrich fails to account for the 22 unemployed workers who now lack disposable income and can't patronize firms. Multiply that millions of times across multiple continents and you've got a falling rate of profit. So via Demand Side econ and via Labor theory, the TRPF survives Heinrich's attacks.

Finally, let's analyze the data. Oh wait, I can't. One's in french and the other is no longer listed. Please send me one or the other if you find it... but so far I've seen no empirical evidence against the TRPF or a refutation of the evidence I provided.

3) Okay cool, the rate of profit was high during and after World War 2, I'm sure that had nothing to do either with a wartime economy artificially inflating demand and a decimated Europe that so desperately needed our help to rebuild that the sum total of labor needed in the US exceeded that made redundant by advances in productivity.

In fact, let's analyze the rate of profit prior to and after that period.

Leading into 1929, there was a demonstrable falling rate of profit that could clearly be shown by nearly every conceivable metric. The question remained what could have caused it. As it turns out, Henry Ford himself had the answer. Leading into 1929, he feared that his new productive processes would render large portions of the workforce redundant and reduce total demand for goods and services by lowering disposable income in workers. He even doubled the wages of his workers in an attempt to counterbalance this tendency. But it was to no avail, and from 1925 onwards, unemployment slowly rose, average wages were unable to keep up with productivity, and thus we encountered under-consumption. This isn't just fringe Marxism either, this was all covered by  Bernard Beaudreau in his book  Beaudreau, Bernard ""*Mass Production, the Stock Market Crash and the Great Depression*."" I'd attach it here, but it's not available as a pdf online. You can buy a copy online, if you'd like. Joseph Stiglitz and Bruce Greenwald further corroborate this claim. The fucking NBER even concluded, against what Heinrich previously suggested, that lower production costs were not being transferred into prices for consumers

Concerning the recovery, in the link you cite the rate of profit only began to meaningfully counteract it's pre depression fall in 1942, well into the war. By that point, we'd already mobilized domestic industry to arm, feed, and clothe our friends in Europe. So to use this as ""proof"" that the tendency of the rate of profit to fall is bunk, or that it can be counteracted by boosting aggregate demand, is just a fucking lie, flat out. Read [Michael Roberts](https://thenextrecession.wordpress.com/2012/08/06/the-great-depression-and-the-war/) to learn more.

Following the post-war period, from the 60s to the 80s, even by the metrics of [the Fed](https://thenextrecession.wordpress.com/2016/10/04/the-us-rate-of-profit-1948-2015/) there was a falling rate of profit which was only partially stumped by the Reagan administration, who were able to counterbalance it by gutting union protections (thus allowing for more surplus value extraction with lower wages and longer hours), cutting taxes, etc. all of which Marx acknowledges as counter tendencies. When we control for these variables, it is undeniable that there is a tendency for the rate of profit to fall, as [Kliman, Roberts](https://thenextrecession.wordpress.com/2015/06/01/theres-a-long-term-decline-in-the-rate-of-profit-and-i-am-not-joking/), [Basu, and Manolakos](https://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1098&amp;context=econ_workingpaper) all corroborate.

[],,treefaeller,,,,[],,,,text,t2_6z2qans2,False,False,[],"Let me guess ... your speciality is transactional, perhaps civil, not criminal, nor appellate, right?

From a practical standpoint, item 1 makes it a non-starter. LEO unions would kill it. And never underestimate the power of public employee unions in California. I've been involved in politics in California, and unions such as CSLEA and CTA are very much in charge in Sacramento.

Personally, I'm all in favor of item 2. Not just because it is a sensible tradeoff in getting this passed, but because I think it is the right thing. Guns are very dangerous, and anyone who has access to them (legally, that's called possession) needs to be able to demonstrate that they will most likely act responsibly. This is exactly the model of gun rights that is used in most European countries: You have to work on a lot of preconditions (tests, background, licensing), but once you have jumped these hurdles, you actually end up with more freedom to own guns than what we have here in California. Gun rights in places like Sweden or Switzerland are actually LESS restrictive than what we experience here.

But item 2 is what kills your proposal. Look at it from the viewpoints of the only people who matter, the extremists on both sides. The pro-gun side today is nearly always foaming-at-the-mouth ultra-conservative. They will say that guns are a GOD GIVEN RIGHT, and WHICH PART NOT SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND, and THE TREE OF LIBERTY HAS TO BE REFRESHED WITH ... your blood. Obviously, these people don't have the slightest clue about law, ethics, civil rights, or constitutional jurisprudence. Let's just start with the first word out of their mouth: God is not a entity of constitutional law, end of discussion. OK, I'm getting facetious. There is no way hard-liners would accept licensing. Now let's look on the other side: anti-gun activists would probably dislike your proposal too, because they see it exactly as what it is: the camel's nose under the tent. Once you have licensed and checked people, it just makes sense to expand their gun rights. For example, look at Europe, where licensed shooters can even own machine guns! That would be terribly, since we know (since Al Capone) that machine guns KILL PEOPLE, so we can't have that. Again, I'm getting facetious. But the reality is that once you combine items 2 and 3, it becomes a non-starter for the anti-gun crowd.

And then your item 3. It's purely reactive: you are reacting to the most recent injuries that gun rights have suffered in California. But think a little broader: Once you have stringent licensing (perhaps at multiple levels), very little gun law makes any sense. Really, for someone who has passed POST (which is something I also advocate as a pre-requisite to gun ownership), owning machine guns and silencers is a non-issue. Similarly, someone with that level of training and background can carry, concealed or open. So let's broaden it: most California gun control just doesn't make any sense. At this point, all your item 3 comes down to a very simple argument: strict scrutiny. Restrictive laws (including things like seat belt laws, speeding laws, and well, gun laws) are a good thing, if they are there to serve a strong public interest (such as public safety), they actually do serve that interest (they really do make things safer, in a measurable and sensible way), and they are the least restrictive method to reach that public interest. You could simply replace all of your item 3 with: all gun restrictions have to survive strict scrutiny testing.

I really like the way you think, and the goal. One of the things I've been pushing (including in working with legislators in Sacto) is to use licensing models, for example RAW, or 03FFL+CoE for the 30-day wait and ammo purchases.

But if you phrase it as a ""tit-for-tat"" (remember, I asked about being transactional), it won't work, because the extremists will see that you are horse trading, and they want purity. I think the right way to frame the discussion is: This is the right thing to do. A licensing/capability based model of gun ownership both makes society much safer (by taking guns out of the hands of 90% of the population, who is not interested in being licensed, or would not pass criteria), and that is exactly the 90% that causes trouble.

But once you and me agree on that licensing-based approach, riddle me this: How do you propose to transition to the brave new world of only licensed gun owners? Today, California has at least 30 or 40 million guns in circulation. A significant fraction can not be found, as they are not in any database (black market, or oldies). How do you propose to confiscate that fraction? How do you propose to license the majority of guns? Remember, when registration of assault weapons became mandatory, compliance with registration was probably in the single digit percent!

You're ignoring how flawed the market rate is generated, as can be seen in the multiple real estate bubbles. Besides the (in)famous 2008 bubble in the US, there are ongoing bubbles in strong economies (Australia - Chinese nationals buy houses to secure their wealth from the CCP) as well as developing ones (Romania - after joining the EU in 2007 housing prices jumped 20%), and those are the places where this type of ""architecture"" is thriving.

For architecture (especially on this subject) less really is more. Continuing my example with Belgium, after their 1980-1985 bubble, they managed to modify their building and zoning regulations to contain a series of measures that greatly increased the quality of the built environment (ranging from rent control to reducing maximum population density for areas). That lead to land prices to rise fast, but since the regulations were so draconic (it's fucking Belgium after all) they almost exclusively targeted luxury housing.

Cat despre revizii - am manual de intretinere. Acolo scrie ce si cand se schimba, se verifica, sa nu fiu ""total pe langa"". Atelierul unde merg eu se ocupa sa imi comande cele necesare, si tot ei le si schimba.

La fiecare revizie anuala, se mai uita, si daca e ceva, imi recomanda ei sa schimb.

I think you must have got through the first section (e.g. the diary entries) and are now in the interview section of the book? This is quite long, and sprawling, and jumps around a fair bit. Best advice might be to just go with the flow, and don't feel like you need to keep too much of it in your head as you read onwards through this section. It is likely better to just enjoy each of the stories for what they are, and you might find as you go on it becomes a bit more clear. But it is not an easy book, as its structure is unusual. 

In terms of some context, [this article](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/in-the-labyrinth-a-users-guide-to-bolao) gives a bit of background and a short blurb on each book without giving away spoilers. This is the Bolano book that deals with his own past (as a Chilean writer who spent some time in his youth living in Mexico City, and travelling around Europe--he eventually ended up living in Spain). 

Finally, there is r/robertobolano which you might be interested in subscribing to. I am now trying to get it going as it has been v quiet lately--but hopefully once it picks up a few more subscribers we will have some good discussions/do some readings etc. So do join if that sounds interesting.

Taiwan has changed hands multiple times over the past 400 years... to say it only ""belongs to China"" ignores history and facts.

&gt;and the fact remains that Taiwan is not a real country. Taiwan is not officially recognized by many and is not an official member of the UN (but PRC is). Real facts. They're treated as an independent city, kind of like a city-state. nothing more.

I must ask, do you really believe this? When you examine the facts, do you really think that Taiwan, officially as the ROC, isn't a real country? Or is this something you simply repeat because it makes your country sound stronger than it actually is. I really don't understand why Chinese people feel the need to lie to themselves.

Being a UN member isn't a requirement to be considered an independent state... Switzerland wasn't a UN member until 2002, do you believe Switzerland wasn't a country before that?

Recognition also isn't a requirement to be considered a ""real country""... the most accepted legal definition of an independent state in international law is generally agreed to be the Montevideo Convention: ""The state as a person of international law should possess the following qualifications: (a) a permanent population; (b) a defined territory; (c) government; and (d) capacity to enter into relations with the other states."" Article 3 explicitly states that ""The political existence of the state is independent of recognition by the other states"".

Taiwan has A, B, C and D.

The European Union also specified in the Badinter Arbitration Committee that they also follow the Montevideo Convention in its definition of a state: by having a territory, a population, and a political authority.

One aspect that would have changed the whole dynamic of European history would be how England/Britain would have continued its cultural/economic alignment with the Scandinavian nations rather than be pulled into mainland Europe, as it did. 
You would have found a more isolationist nation, less interested in affecting European affairs, especially regarding France as there wouldn‚Äôt have been any king with a ancestral claim to it. Would France have become a more powerful nation had it not had to suffer the consistent threat of attacks from across the channel? Would that threat come from elsewhere?  
The question then begs, would the resource rich nation of England/Britain become prey for more powerful European nations later?  I think so.  Rome saw England in a very similar light to how England later saw the America‚Äôs; it was a cash cow, a resource hub, and at some point I believe would have been a target for invasion. The problem would have been, akin to Rome‚Äôs attack under Hannibal, that without the constant threat of war, England wouldn‚Äôt have developed militarily to the extent it did, at least not to the level of its mainland European rivals.  Maybe a Scandinavian union would have kept the European nations at bay early on, but as the years and technology progressed, I think the power gap would have widened.
Maybe a greater emphasis placed on that maritime Scandinavian community would have bore out a larger navy, but again, not to the technological level it did historically. 
I do like to think though, that England would have discovered nations like both north and South America much earlier than it did, with a far greater emphasis put on discovery than war.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2019-05-04/five-myths-of-china-s-belt-and-road-initiative

&gt; The one-trillion-dollar figure often seen in headlines likely low-balls projected outlays. But $8 trillion ‚Äî the top end of estimates ‚Äî is pure fantasy. It‚Äôs hard to put a realistic dollar figure on a project that is so spectacularly ill-defined: China has never published a full list of Belt and Road projects. The American Enterprise Institute and Heritage Chinese Global Investment Tracker, which monitors actual Chinese construction and investment (rather than promises), puts the total at roughly¬†$340 billion¬†during the period 2014‚Äì2017. **It‚Äôs safe to say that over the lifetime of the project (another slippery concept since China hasn‚Äôt given an end-date) cumulative spending will be less than what the U.S. squandered on futile wars in the Middle East and Asia in recent decades**. Of course, this is one reason why the U.S. hasn‚Äôt been able to come up with a real counter to the Belt and Road beyond rhetorical barbs. **Washington doesn‚Äôt have the money**

https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/26/opinion/china-belt-road-initiative.html

&gt;China does not publish details about its overseas lending, but the¬†China-Africa Research Initiative¬†at Johns Hopkins University (which I direct) has collected information on¬†more than 1,000 Chinese loans in Africa between 2000 and 2017, totaling more than $143 billion. Boston University‚Äôs¬†Global Development Policy Center¬†has identified and tracked¬†more than $140 billion in Chinese loans to Latin America and the Caribbean since 2005.

&gt;**Based on the findings of both institutes, it seems that¬†the risks of B.R.I. are often overstated or mischaracterized**

&gt;We at the China Africa Research Initiative created debt profiles for those countries based on our data on Chinese loans as well as statistics from the World Bank and the I.M.F. ‚Äî and we discovered that a crowd of global banks and bondholders were involved: notably, in Mozambique, Credit Suisse; or in Chad, the Anglo-Swiss mining giant Glencore. In some of the 17 countries the I.M.F. identified as vulnerable, including Cameroon and Ethiopia, China was the single-largest creditor, but **non-Chinese lenders still held the majority of the debt**. 

&gt;In its 2019 study on China in Latin America and the Caribbean, the Global Development Policy Center concluded that, aside from ‚Äúthe important possible exception of Venezuela,‚Äù financing from China alone **did not appear to be driving borrowers above the I.M.F‚Äôs debt-sustainability thresholds**

https://lawrencefreemanafricaandtheworld.com/2018/11/03/dont-listen-to-propaganda-gossip-follow-the-facts-china-is-not-creating-a-debt-trap-for-africa/

And this is coming from actual Western researchers:

https://liberationschool.org/five-imperialist-myths-about-chinas-role-in-africa/


&gt;Myth 1: Chinese investment merely repeats ‚Äúneo-colonial‚Äù patterns

&gt;**What country in Africa is politically directed from China? Not one**. There is one African country with a Chinese military base, Djibouti, but its politics are not directed from Beijing. While there are arguably examples of ‚Äúdumping‚Äù of Chinese products in some African countries, **no country has been obliged to exclude ‚Äúcompeting products from elsewhere**.‚Äù **China controls no African banking system**. African countries have begun to adopt the Chinese yuan as a foreign currency reserve, but they have done so as a form of diversification away from dependence on the dollar and Euro.

&gt;Myth 2: Chinese enterprises only employ Chinese workers

&gt;After surveying 1,000 Chinese companies in Africa, the McKinsey consulting firm noted: **89 percent of employees were African, adding up to more than 300,000 jobs for African workers**. Scaled up across all 10,000 Chinese firms in Africa, these numbers suggest that Chinese-owned business already employ several million Africans.‚Äù

&gt;According to research conducted by the China Africa Research Initiative, ‚Äú**locals are more than four-fifths of employees at 400 Chinese enterprises and projects in 40-plus African countries**.‚Äù Additionally, ‚Äú**surveys of employment on Chinese projects in Africa repeatedly find that three-quarters or more of the workers are in fact, local**.‚Äù


&gt;Myth 3: China is engaged in massive land grabs

&gt;Deborah Brautigam and her team of researchers investigated this issue as part of a Johns Hopkins University research project on China and Africa, and produced a book, ‚ÄúWill Africa Feed China?‚Äù **They found that China owned or leased ‚Äúfewer than 700,000 acres‚Äù of land in Africa, much less than the 15 million acres the Western press had reported**. Moreover:

&gt;The largest existing Chinese farms were rubber, sugar, and sisal plantations. **None were growing food for export to China**. And while countries like Zambia now host as many as several dozen Chinese entrepreneurs who grow crops and raise chickens for local markets, **we found no villages of Chinese peasants**.

&gt; In further research¬†they found that this process has been highly uneven from country to country.¬†**As of 2016,¬†41¬†percent of China‚Äôs land purchases in Africa were in one country alone**

&gt;Myth 4: China is working to trap African nations in debt

&gt;According to research done by scholars at Boston University and John Hopkins University, from 2000 to 2015 China lent African nations at least $95.5 billion. This is a big number. However, **Chinese debt can only be viewed relative to Africa‚Äôs total debt. Chinese loans from 2000 to 2016 only accounted for 1.8 percent of Africa‚Äôs foreign debts**.

&gt;Research shows that **Chinese loans are not speculative or tied to privatization projects and ‚Äústructural adjustment,‚Äù as IMF loans typically are**. The vast majority of these loans help make up gaps in infrastructure financing. An unusually honest article in the Washington Post explained: ‚ÄúOn a continent where over 600 million Africans have no access to electricity, **40 percent of Chinese loans paid for power generation and transmission. Another 30 percent went to modernizing Africa‚Äôs crumbling transport infrastructure**.‚Äù


&gt;What gets omitted or mystified in most articles on Chinese loans is that **Africa was already in a ‚Äúdebt trap‚Äù from the same countries indicting China: Western imperialist states**.

&gt;The West decimated African nations all throughout the 1980s and 1990s **with neoliberal structural adjustment plans, which pushed austerity onto already poor nations, forced them to take loans that have interest rates impossible to pay back, and moreover, are strapped with conditions that are fundamentally neo-colonial**: they determine what governance is ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúbad,‚Äù holding any and all aid essentially at gunpoint to these African nations.


&gt;Despite the reporting from the Western press, **it was the onerous and accumulating interest rates of Western loans ‚Äî not China‚Äôs ‚Äî that caused Sri Lanka‚Äôs financial crisis**. Sri Lanka had been paying its Chinese loans on time (China represents only 15% of its foreign debt). **In order to not default on its loans to the West, and to escape stringent conditions to receive new IMF loans, Sri Lanka has been seeking new low-interest loans and debt-equity swaps from China and India. This‚Äìand not a predatory debt trap‚Äìis what led to the leasing of the port.**

&gt;In contrast with the West, **China‚Äôs loans in Africa are largely a mix of zero or low-interest loans with sometimes decades-long repayment plans**. Some are concessional and re-negotiable, as well as tied to the actual success and productivity of the projects


&gt;As Tim Hancock writes in a recent story about the Rhodium Group‚Äôs study on 40 cases of Chinese foreign lending: ‚Äú**China‚Äôs leverage remains limited, with many of the renegotiations resolved in favour of the borrower**. Debt write-offs were found in 14 cases, deferments in 11 cases, and refinancing and debt term changes accounting for most other cases.‚Äù


&gt; Myth 5: China targets African states with plentiful natural resources and dictators

&gt;Provided a country recognizes¬†the One-China policy (with respect to Taiwan), **China engages with nearly every single sub-Saharan African nation**.

&gt;Five of the top 10 nations that receive Chinese investment (Egypt, Mauritius, Tanzania, Ethiopia, and Madagascar) **are not ‚Äúresource rich‚Äù countries**. According to a¬†report¬†by the OECD, Chinese foreign direct investment in Africa **‚Äúhas not been particularly skewed towards the natural resources sector in international comparison.‚Äù**


&gt;Since 1964, China‚Äôs Premier Zhou En Lai emphasized¬†that in its dealings with African countries, **it would attach no political conditions** ‚Äî and this is the principle repeated consistently in Chinese newspapers and international conferences today. **China has an interest in modeling this sort of conduct given that it faces constant political interference itself from the West.**

&gt;In a recent speech in New York City,¬†Socialist Party of Zambia leader Cosmas Musumali warned against anti-China xenophobia, explained that a socialist Zambia would need partnerships with China, and reiterated:¬†**‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have a Chinese problem ‚Äî we have a government problem.‚Äù**",True,False,False,,,,1,1599037078,,False,0,{},g3p4rxt,False,t3_il2arg,False,False,t1_g3p3ta9,/r/Coronavirus/comments/il2arg/xi_jinping_promises_to_prioritize_africa_for/g3p4rxt/,False,,1611492175,6,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,r/Coronavirus,public,,0,[],

We had planned to visit my parents in the States before moving to Ireland permanently, and when we decided to cut our trip short the EU travel ban had just been introduced, so getting him checked in for our flight from Vietnam was a nightmare‚Äîalthough he hadn't been in the EU for over two years and as the spouse of a US citizen he should've been exempt from the ban even if he had, the restriction had *just* come into place and it seemed the airline staff (understandably) didn't really know the details. 

It took so much finagling to get them to allow him on the plane, and I expected that when we actually arrived in the US it would be even worse. US immigration officers aren't generally known for their chill at the best of times. But when we got to America, it was the complete opposite. Since Philly wasn't one of the airports accepting flights from Europe, the international terminal was nearly empty. And the immigration officer was super friendly and kind. He asked us where we were staying and when I said with my parents, he asked if they'd be okay having us longer if the lockdown prevented us from leaving on schedule, and he made a few jokes about whether they were the strict type who would make us sleep in separate bedrooms.  

After the stress of deciding whether to cut our trip short, worrying we were going to end up locked down in Vietnam, worrying we wouldn't be able to board the plane in Hanoi, worrying we wouldn't be able to board the plane in Doha, etc. it was such a relief. 

Side story: in normal times, I had to laugh at one of my experiences with Irish immigration when I was still a visitor rather than living here. I'm always nervous so I prepared loads of documentation (departing plane ticket, proof of funds to support myself, approved WHV to New Zealand to show I had a reason to leave, etc.) and the officer said ""How long are you staying?"" and had my passport stamped and back to me before I could even get an answer out.",True,False,False,,,,0,1599038756,,False,0,{},g3p71im,False,t3_il3g1t,False,False,t3_il3g1t,/r/TravelNoPics/comments/il3g1t/what_was_the_most_pleasant_immigration_experience/g3p71im/,False,,1611493248,15,True,False,TravelNoPics,t5_jktgr,r/TravelNoPics,public,,0,[],

Title: **Seeking legal advice for travel industry regulations and private company limitations within them.**

Original Post: 

&gt; Hello.
&gt; Have a question regarding business laws and free market regulations, etc. (I'll avoid names for now in case it may cause problems).
&gt; 
&gt; One of the biggest US based online travel aggregators has a contract term where it states that if the partner (hotel, etc.) doesn't request payments for the sold reservations (via the aggregator) within 12 months, the aggregator don't have to uphold the request and can keep the money.
&gt; 
&gt; To clarify.. customer (traveler) makes reservations via the travel aggregator, to the partner's accommodation/service. The travel aggregator collects the online payment as part of the service, charges their service fee and should pay out the remaining to the partner as normal business practice. 
&gt; Normally, this process would be automatic and payments made monthly (as it is with most other aggregators). Yet this specific travel aggregator has set up a procedure where they need the partner to first request the payment invoice via their digital system. 
&gt; And they have written into a contract that the payment request time is 12 months. Invoicing any older upstanding payments don't carry obligations for them to neither pay the partner or pay back the customer, resulting them just keeping the entire initial customer payment.
&gt; To note here, they don't send a single notification about anything upstanding or about to 'expire'.
&gt; 
&gt; For a European, this whole thing smells a lot like something against fare commercial business practice. 
&gt; 
&gt; I sell my service via some website, the website collects the payment, and if I don't demand it from them within their stated time frame and methods, they won't pay me..?
&gt; 
&gt; What laws are there to regulate this kind of practice? Because it doesn't make sense that any individual company can write up whatever contract they want to, and have no oversight for consumer protection in such cases.
&gt; 
&gt; The aggregator is US based company, the partner is EU based company, the customers are random worldwide (irrelevant in this case).
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you for any info!

I suggest you look. The links between the European far-right and Russia are extensive, have caused the downfall of at least one government, and run to projects totaling billions of Euros being offered on no-tender contracts by Russophile wannabe dictators. 

The French National Front took Russian loans to the value of at least 11 million Euros. Marine le Pen after that supported the annexation of Crimea by Russia. - https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-39478066

The Hungarian government gave the Russians a no-tender contract to build a nuclear reactor in that country, and Victor Orban is consciously modelling his attacks on Hungarian democracy on Putin's precedents. He constantly calls for the lifting of EU sanctions on Russia.

AfD politicians from that far-right German party frequently travel for meetings to Russia, support lifting sanctions and are anti-EU. Leaked Russian documents talk about AfD politicians being controlled by Russia - https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-47822835

My understanding is that the initial data sent cannot be requested again, and the emergency services will still ask you where you are, and if you aren't sure, will try and get you to locate yourself or ask you to use W3W (or in the case of Mountain Rescue, direct you to the SARLOC website which will locate you without installing an app).",True,False,False,,,,0,1599043334,,1599043623,0,{},g3pbjxr,False,t3_iks14u,False,True,t1_g3papcg,/r/MotoUK/comments/iks14u/jewelers_heist_using_motorcycle_to_smash_door_down/g3pbjxr/,False,,1611495597,2,True,False,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,r/MotoUK,public,,0,[],

Soviet Union 

shortly after the end of the war, more than one million ethnic Germans from Russia were in special settlements and labor camps in Siberia and Central Asia. It is estimated that 200,000 to 300,000 died of starvation, lack of shelter, over-work and disease during the 1940s.[5]

 
In the dying days of World War II and during the occupation of Germany, Soviet forces invaded German villages and raped German women en masse. It is believed by historian Antony Beevor that ""a 'high proportion' of at least 15 million women who lived in the Soviet zone or were expelled from Germany's eastern provinces were raped.""[6] Several thousand women committed suicide. On the final day of hostilities, 900 women in one village just east of Berlin took their children and drowned them in the river (followed by their own suicides) as soon as they heard the Russian guns coming. In all, only about 4,000 Soviet soldiers were ever punished for 

1944: The displacement of the majority ethnic Estonian population from the Estonian city of Narva by Soviet occupation authorities.

Yugoslavia 

1944 to 1945: The ethnic cleansing of Hungarians, or the massacres in Baƒçka by Titoist partisans during the winter of 1944‚Äì45; about 40,000 massacred.Afterwards, between 45‚Äì48, internment camps were set which led directly to the death of 70,000 more, of famine, frost, plagues, tortures and executions.
 

1943 to 1960: The Istrian-Dalmatian Exodus involved the diaspora of 350,000, mostly ethnic Italians together with anti-communist Slovene and Croat people, from Istria, Fiume and Dalmatian lands (mainly from the city of Zara), after the collapse of Italian fascist regime

November and December 1944: more than 200,000 Danube Swabians in Yugoslavia were expelled from their homes and interned in starvation and Nazi concentration camps for the old, young and disabled. Some 30,000 workers were expelled to Russia as slave laborers for war reparations.[

 


Ussr Czechoslovakia and Poland 

after the war mainly in Poland Czech Republic and Hungary and former German areas annexed by Poland and Russia such as Prussia or East Pomerania  

1944 to 1948: Flight and expulsion of Germans after World War II. Between 13.5 and 16.5 million German-speakers fled, were evacuated or later expelled from Central and Eastern Europe,[44][45] making this the largest single instance of ethnic cleansing in recorded history. Estimated number of those who died in the process is being debated by historians and estimated between 500,000 and 3,000,000.

[],,[deleted],,,,,,,dark,,,,,[],"&gt; Slovenia is among the few countries in Europe that have experienced a swift downturn in press and media freedom, according to the latest report of the International Press Institute, IPI, a global network of journalists, editors and media executives defending press freedom.

&gt; Jamie Wiseman, Advocacy Officer at IPI, stated in the¬†in-depth report¬†published on Tuesday that the Slovenian government led by Janez Jansa was contributing to an increasingly hostile environment for journalists.

&gt; The IPI report noted that, according to some observers, Jansa has launched ‚Äúvitriolic attacks on reporters on Twitter, enabling a wider increase in digital harassment from online trolls and contributing to an increasingly hostile climate for watchdog journalism‚Äù.

&gt; Jansa, an ally of authoritarian Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, returned for a third stint as prime minister on March 13, a little over a week after Slovenia confirmed its first case of the coronavirus. He replaced Marjan Sarec, whose centre-left coalition fell in January.

&gt; The change of power coincided with what the IPI said is an unprecedented wave of insults and online smear campaigns¬†against journalists in Slovenia.

&gt; Jansa has taken to Twitter to denounce the Slovenian public broadcaster; his government has sought to portray mainstream media outlets as heirs of the Yugoslav-era communist security services, while the government‚Äôs Crisis Headquarters, tasked with coordinating the fight against COVID-19, has retweeted anonymous attacks on the investigative journalist Blaz Zgaga.

&gt; As IPI recalled, in mid-March, a government account retweeted a claim that Zgaga was an ‚Äúescaped psychiatric patient‚Äù. Shortly after that, the reporter began receiving numerous online death threats and smears, drawing condemnation from international organisations.

&gt; Observers and journalists told IPI that ‚Äúanimosity from officials has enabled increasing harassment of journalists online‚Äù, from which neither foreign journalists nor public television journalists were spared.

&gt; Despite reasons for worry, Wiseman wrote that ‚Äúconcerns that Slovenia will become another illiberal democracy akin to Hungary are, for now, premature‚Äù.

&gt; ‚ÄùNonetheless the exporting of Hungarian methods to Slovenia and other states in Central and South-Eastern European countries should worry EU leaders,‚Äù he continued, urging the EU and other organisations to follow developments in Slovenia closely and react strongly if need be.

&gt; ‚ÄúIn the coming weeks, all eyes will be focused on the end of the public consultation into the legislative amendments to the public broadcaster and press agency,‚Äù the report noted, referring to plans by Slovenia‚Äôs government to amend public service media¬†legislation, which some experts see as an attempt to rein in state media.

&gt; On the other hand, the Slovenian Culture Ministry told BIRN in July that nothing in the set of laws indicates that public media will be put under direct state influence. ‚ÄúThe laws are not changing corporate or programming governance of RTV Slovenia, nor do they have provisions to do that,‚Äù it pointed out.

&gt; On August 25, the government¬†responded¬†to an alert on the Council of Europe‚Äôs platform, which monitors press freedom, issued in May, attaching Jansa‚Äôs own essay, ‚ÄúWar with the media‚Äù, and offered additional explanations, insisting that ‚Äúfreedom of expression is a right that belongs to every individual‚Äù.

&gt; ‚ÄúNegative criticism of an individual journalist, publisher or broadcaster by the prime minister, does not automatically render it an attack or an encroachment on media independence,‚Äú the letter said.

&gt; ‚ÄúFinally the World Press Freedom Index, published annually by international non-governmental organization Reporters Without Borders, ranks Slovenia 32nd, which is two places better than in 2019 and the same as in 2018,‚Äù the government observed.",False,False,False,,,,0,1599045429,,False,0,{},g3pds0r,False,t3_il4uwh,False,False,t3_il4uwh,/r/europe/comments/il4uwh/a_new_report_by_the_international_press_institute/g3pds0r/,False,,1611496790,1,True,False,europe,t5_2qh4j,r/europe,public,,0,[],

Like the US store, we cannot generally comment on availability at this time for the EU store.  Availability, however, will not be any sooner than the dates NVIDIA mentioned for each GPU.
HYBRID, HC, and KPE cards will come a bit later than the XC3 and FTW3 cards.  No ETA to give you, which is probably your next question.
HYBRIDs will be 240mm, except for KPE HYBRID, whch will be 360mm.  No plans for a 120mm HYBRID at this time.
HYBRIDs will be 2 Slot.
XC3 cards will all be 2.2 slots.  Length is 11.23in. - 285.37mm / Height is 4.38in. - 111.15 mm.
FTW3 cards will be 2.75 slots.  Length is 11.81in. - 300mm / Height is 5.38in. - 136.75mm.
There will be an EVGA NVLINK.  No ETA at this time.
Since I've seen this mentioned incorrectly, all cards are 3 DisplayPort, 1 HDMI.
PowerLink is expected to work with the XC3 models.  For obvious reasons, it will not work with the 3090/3080 FTW3 cards due to the number of PCIe power connectors.  Either way, we will have the compatibility list updated when the cards are available on the website.
Step-Up will begin when cards are available.  Products will not be listed prior to general availability.  I would expect one of the XC3 models will be listed for availability, but we will make that decision prior to general availability.
I'm not sure why people assume bots are buying cards over regular people.  It was a popular reason for why 20-Series cards were always out of stock, which completely ignored literal supply and demand issues (lots of people wanted them, but there weren't many initially).  Yes, there are per person quantity caps for each card.  Yes, we require captcha to login, which is also required to create a profile.  This should help to comfort some of you.‚Äù",True,False,False,,,,0,1599045736,,False,0,{},g3pe5zj,False,t3_il4ld3,False,True,t1_g3pdzn2,/r/nvidia/comments/il4ld3/what_is_your_favorite_rtx_aib_card_right_now_for/g3pe5zj/,False,,1611496984,1,True,False,nvidia,t5_2rlgy,r/nvidia,public,,0,[],

[],,[deleted],,,,,,,dark,,,,,[],"Sou de BH, mas estava pensando em me mudar pro Rio ou SP porque √© onde eu vou ter mais oportunidades de trabalhar na √°rea. Por enquanto, vou procurar por aqui algo do tipo ou at√© mesmo curso on-line.

Amei as dicas. Por enquanto o que tenho feito √© tentar escrever roteiros porque eu sempre escrevi e quando decidi que queria estudar cinema era o que eu queria fazer, mas interessante sua dica de come√ßar com fotografia, faz sentido e eu tenho a ferramenta, o celular. E aqui em BH tem curso gratuito ou em conta de fotografia, j√° fica mais f√°cil.

J√° tinha ouvido falar do Mubi e tenho interesse sim, mas esse legacy of Brazilian cinema, nunca tinha ouvido falar, vou procurar imediatamente, j√° amei s√≥ pelo nome pq estou atualmente apaixonada por cinema brasileiro.

Vou considerar filme comercial aqueles que s√£o feitos com o intuito de conseguir muita bilheteria, sem compromisso com qualidade, aprofundamento de tema, personagens, etc, ent√£o prefiro filmes art√≠sticos. Eu sempre vi o audiovisual (filme, s√©rie, document√°rio) como uma forma de humanizar as pessoas, olhar para as situa√ß√µes com mais empatia, uma ferramenta de reflex√£o, sempre me inspirei muito em filmes, cresci assistindo e as vezes brinco que alem de ter sido criada pelos meus pais e irm√£os fui criada tamb√©m pelo cinema (e literatura e m√∫sica que tamb√©m sempre foram uma grande parte da minha vida), sinto uma grande influ√™ncia do cinema no meu car√°ter, assistia e me motivava, me identificava e eventualmente escrever sempre foi uma forma que encontrei de me expressar j√° que sempre fui t√≠mida. Acho que essa foi uma resposta longa pra qual tipo de filme eu gosto rsrsrsrs

Adorei a sugest√£o de artes porque na realidade eu adoro arte do general, amo ir em museu, exposi√ß√µes, tenho acompanhado o canal da Vivieuvi no YouTube e vejo uma influ√™ncia muito grande da arte no cinema. Na real, o mais legal do cinema √© ser essa mistura de tudo.

Atualmente me interesso por dire√ß√£o, produ√ß√£o e roteiro, √© o que me vejo fazendo at√© porque sinto que pelo menos dire√ß√£o e produ√ß√£o acaba exercendo um controle criativo sobre tudo. E eu sempre fui muito controladora rsrsrsrs Quando eu estudava, acaba sempre liderando os grupos, at√© por ser muito perfeccionista, eu definia como ia ser os trabalhos, quem ia fazer o que, mas sempre soube ouvir os colegas e tentar encaixar a opini√£o de cada um. Ent√£o me identifico muito com dire√ß√£o e produ√ß√£o, mas eu sempre escrevi e tenho muitas ideias, portanto roteiro tamb√©m √© algo que me identifico.

Assim, n√£o tenho tanto dinheiro, o bom √© que eu sempre juntei um pouquinho do meu sal√°rio (meu irm√£o sempre pegou no meu pe com isso rsrsrs), e agora vou ter o acerto, seguro desemprego e eu n√£o costumo gastar com bobagem, ent√£o vou dar uma olhadinha e ver o que √© vi√°vel pra mim. Obrigada pela dica da Praga Film School, n√£o conhecia. Adoraria ir pra fora mesmo que seja por pouco tempo e tenho muita vontade e coragem de pegar minhas coisas ir pra algum lugar que nunca fui sozinha.

Eu gosto de v√°rios tipos de filmes, drama, document√°rio, fic√ß√£o cient√≠fica, a√ß√£o, aventura, fantasia, comedia, romance, e estou apaixonada por cinema brasileiro que tenho achado dif√≠cil encaixar num g√™nero. Mas acho que depende muito da hist√≥ria, porque tem filmes desses g√™neros que n√£o curto. Eu lembro que n√£o curtia filme de a√ß√£o, at√© achar um com uma hist√≥ria e uma execu√ß√£o que amei, ent√£o sou bem aberta √† todos os g√™neros e tenho tentado assistir filmes de outros pa√≠ses tamb√©m e sempre uma experi√™ncia de outro mundo.

The fact that we probably won't be able to meet climate targets because we did not invest enough in renewable energy R&amp;D in the past but threw it on a technology which may or may not produce something useful in the far far future shows that: YES you indeed can waste money on R&amp;D if you bet on the wrong tech. 

&gt;  it is also worth noting that new designs (so called Generation IV reactors) seem to be able to tackle these problems a lot better.

Where do they seem to be able to do this exactly?

&gt;  Ironically they lack funding though. 

Yeah, they lack funding for a reason.  
The reason is that renewables are cheaper and this won't change anymore. 

&gt; But I‚Äôm still for leaving coal behind first, then nuclear. 

There was never a nuclear vs. coal situation in the first place in Germany. 
The main reason why coal is still there an will be phased out so slowly is because there are poor regions of the country which depend on the jobs in the industry. It's not that we lack energy or something. It's just politicians who don't want to lose voters to the far right party which is pro coal (or rather: anti everything the green party/people want).

Not a single coal plant would have been closed down if we'd have kept nuclear here.  

&gt; Your point of the gird being spread out is of course valid but I doubt it‚Äôs as simple as that, considering potential political and strategic risks that come with being reliant on buying electricity.

Luckily we're all in the EU and the risks are so far fetched that ignoring the real risks of rotting French reactors in favour of those risks seems just ridiculous. 

&gt; Also the biggest renewable source is solar and when it‚Äôs night in Germany, it‚Äôs also night in the rest of Europe...

This is not true.  
The biggest renewable source is [wind](https://i.imgur.com/TIrLhgi.jpeg).

Edit: new numbers for [2019](https://i.imgur.com/bZd6qZR.jpg). Just shares of renewables where wind on sea and land add up to 51,6% of all renewables.

Interestingly enough, I've never met a German I didn't like, but I'm also adamant that the unification of Germany is one of the single worst events in human history. For brevity, I'm going to talk about Germany as an entity in a very simplistic sense, so this doesn't go for every individual German, but rather for the nation when acting as a whole.

I'll try to be relatively concise in my explanation, but the core issue is the prevailing German culture: it values efficiency and getting the job done - whatever that job may be - but doesn't put nearly enough value on caution, forethought, and self-reflection. What this means is that Germany - more than seemingly any other nation in Europe - has a tendency to charge ahead into plans it convinces itself are fantastic ideas, only to realise far too late that it's actually a terrible idea, by which point it's already created a devastating mess which the rest of Europe/the world then has to clean up.

Germany is defined by hubris and autism, essentially: hubris in its apparent belief (ironically, given what's happened in the past) that it can do no wrong, and that either the rest of Europe should go along with its plans, or they're simply wrong; and autism in its consistent failure to understand or to acknowledge the perspectives of those who disagree as valid, or to be effectively self-critical.

The further problem is that Germany today insists it's one of the most self-reflective and self-critical nations in Europe - a conceit which only furthers its arrogance, ironically - but as anyone outside can see, that simply isn't the case. Two examples I can give are:

1. Spearheading the federalisation of Europe, only to be blindsided when the UK decided it didn't want to be a part of that, as Germany apparently forgot that other nations have different values and priorities to them, and that what's good for Germany isn't automatically good for everyone else.

2. Merkel demonstrating this arrogance on an individual level by effectively creating the ongoing migrant crisis through declaring ""the borders of Europe are open"" - without bothering to ask the rest of Europe if that was actually OK with them first. The fact that even she acknowledged that she fucked up on that front is testament to just how monumental the fuck-up was, but that hasn't done much to help out all the other countries that are now having to spend billions of their taxpayers' money to fund people they never wanted to migrate - usually illegally - to them, and who expected to take advantage of our welfare states in the way Merkel promised.

Even as a Brit, I don't hate Germany for historical reasons, so much as because its antics as functional ruler of the EU show that Germany hasn't learnt the most important lessons from its previous fuck-ups: Germany isn't nearly as infallible as it seems to think, and that makes it by far the most dangerous nation in Europe to everyone else, as we're all constantly at risk of being dragged into the next idiotic scheme Germany concocts and enacts long before they've taken a moment to reflect on what the actual consequences of that scheme may be.

When apologists charge skeptics to provide an account of how the testimonial evidence was produced if there was no resurrection it is not hard to come up with answers.   
We have cases throughout history where when the teachings of a charismatic leader are empirically falsified, there are cases where the believers re-interpret the teachings in a non-falsifiable way. I‚Äôll provide one example, from 1844 and the Millerites.

A man named William Miller predicted Jesus would return on March 21, 1844. When that didn‚Äôt happen the prediction was revised to October 22, 1844. This inspired a large movement in the US with many giving up their earthly possessions in anticipation. When it failed the movement coped in different ways, with one being what led to the Seventh Day Adventist denomination which exists to this day. Hiram Edison reinterpreted the ‚Äúcleansing of the sanctuary‚Äù that was predicted to have occurred in heaven, not on earth as the Millerites mistakenly predicted.

So what happened when Jesus died? Perhaps one disillusioned disciple, maybe Peter, had a dream or grief inspired hallucination. The idea that Jesus died for our sins and redeemed us, that he has ascended into heaven. Perhaps they even thought that god gave him a new heavenly body to replace his destroyed one that was thrown in a mass grave.¬†   
Once the story spreads from Peter, others bereaved followers have similar dreams and religious experiences and over time the story grows in the telling.¬† Eventually Paul is stricken with guilt at his violent persecution of the new cult, perhaps even having a seizure and a vision of Jesus. Eventually taken to the Christians and proclaiming his conversion, his sight eventually returns in their care and a new zealot is born.¬†

Over an even longer period the story evolves further into the gospel narratives among Christians in Greece who scour the greek translation of the Hebrew scriptures to find ways Jesus fulfilled the messiah prophecies. Eventually the story is written down by a crude literate follower, which then adapts and evolves to be cleaned up and grows in the telling in the other gospels.   


As for murdered followers or why someone would ‚Äúdie for a lie‚Äù we have even worse evidence that most of the disciples themselves were actually persecuted than we have for the initial miracle claims themselves. For the cases where we do have good evidence of a disciple being killed for their Christian beliefs we can point to plenty of cases where religious believers die for their beliefs. Joseph Smith, the founder of Mormonism was killed by a mob in a jail, after he and his disciples suffered violent persecution continually throughout the United States.¬†

**Skepticism of the Bible**

The point of all this is to show that we have good reasons to be highly skeptical of the early Christian sources who wrote our primary testimonial accounts that serve as ‚Äúevidence‚Äù that Jesus rose from the dead.¬†

This, combined with the fact that when testimonial evidence is presented for non-Christian miracle claims, even Christians will reject that testimonial evidence, even in cases where we can find living witnesses providing testimony of non-Christian miracles.¬† A Christian may claim that their special divine revelation of a properly basic belief in Christianity gives them rational justification for accepting their Christian miracle claims and rejecting other religions miracle claims ‚Äì but then they have to give up the *argument* for the resurrection as being established on historical or any kind of objective grounds.¬†

It doesn‚Äôt make much sense to say that the argument for the resurrection only works if one already believes Jesus rose from the dead based on special divine revelation!

Finally, it‚Äôs important to note that this isn‚Äôt pure atheistic dogma. I‚Äôm not insisting on methodological naturalism being part of how we evaluate historical claims because we must operate as if there was no god in order to be objective.¬†

Even if one is a mere theist, recently converted by apologetic arguments that a god exists, you still would be stuck operating on a kind of methodological naturalism. If you don‚Äôt then you have to give some kind of basis to reject the mountains of testimonial evidence we have for non-Christian miracle claims and yet retain the Christian ones.¬†

Some apologists attempt to give us a basis for doing so, saying that Jesus‚Äôs teachings seem incredibly moral vs. the teachings of other religions, but this is a poor argument. Appealing to things like the morality of the teachings gets Christians nowhere. Morality is often cultural, and culture is awash in traditional religious teachings which is then dependent on the area. In the US and EU, Christianity informs some of our sense of what is moral, or what we consider as ‚Äútraditionally prohibited‚Äù.¬† But in India, Hindu morality would largely impact what one would traditionally think of as moral or immoral. In the middle east, Islam would. In each case of course the teachings of the miracle workers in that area would seem ‚Äúmore moral‚Äù than the teachings of miracle workers of religions dominant in other areas.

The point is, even if apologists could get someone to give up the methodological naturalism I espouse, they‚Äôd be stuck with having to accept the same kinds of evidence for contradictory religions. This then undercuts the entire point of miracle claims ‚Äì they would no longer serve as strong evidence for the truth of a religion‚Äôs theology and philosophy!¬† Imagine believing god raised Jesus from the dead, but not being a Christian, it sounds absurd!

At this point, the only thing left for a Christian to base their religion on isn‚Äôt arguments and evidence, it‚Äôs purely subjective religious experience and supposed divine revelation. The ‚Äúproperly basic belief‚Äù espoused by Christian philosophers and apologists. The justification that works equally as well for any other religion‚Äôs theology and dogma. I‚Äôm not actually arguing against this as a rational justification for belief. What I am arguing is that the argument for the resurrection of Jesus doesn‚Äôt work on its own to convince skeptics or mere theists that Christianity is true. Maybe a Christian will respond that they accept the resurrection argument and reject the other miracle claims because of their ‚Äúproperly basic‚Äù belief that Christianity is true - but they must recognize that what‚Äôs doing the work there is their subjective religious experience, not anything specific to the evidence regarding the resurrection!

The question I leave any believers with is whether or not they actually feel as if they have this special divine revelation from god that their religion is true, especially in a pre-evidential way.¬† Do you *really* have that?¬† And if you do, why should non-believers take your word over the experiences of another religion‚Äôs believer?

I guess my point boils down to this: as a native English speaker you are at an automatic disadvantage when it comes to languages. It's true that America is a melting pot, with a lot of different languages floating around. But aside from a couple Spanish classes in high school, I think you'll agree with me that most people that grew up with only English in their house, only speak English. And that's not saying anything bad about native English speakers: they're in a luxury position (where everybody speaks to them in their native tongue) that comes with a downside (where they have no motivation to learn anything else).
Add to that the fact that pretty much every non-native English speaker, speaks at least two languages: their mother tongue plus English. This does things to your brain that I can't explain or fathom, but it fundamentally influences your outlook on language.
Now, I'm European. Everybody here speaks their own language, plus English, and most of us (at least millenials) have a basic understanding of at least two or three other languages (for me it's German, French and Italian).

Yeah but sometimes things just happen because it's still humans who are responsible and while Chernobyl is pretty much in the middle of nothing a nuclear disaster in the middle of densely populated Europe would be a horrible catastrophe.

&gt; Honestly the biggest problem with peoples hatred for nuclear power is it stops money being invested into it which could improve its efficiency

Nuclear had their chance.  
Decades over decades of R&amp;D money has been drowned with little gain in efficiency and fusion still far far away. Meanwhile renewables exploded. They gain so much from R&amp;D money that it would be simply stupid to drop a single cent on nuclear.   
It takes 10 years to set up a single nuclear reactor. Look at those efficiency levels for this time: https://www.nrel.gov/pv/assets/images/best-research-cell-efficiencies.20200708.png

So please, stop hating on people who have good reasons to not want further nuclear reactors or waste dumps in their backyard. Not even governments or the market [wants](https://www.diw.de/documents/publikationen/73/diw_01.c.742611.de/dwr-20-11-1.pdf) them anymore.

American fascism. Trump fascism. It doesn‚Äôt have to meet the moment the same way it did with Hitler but Trump craves a dictatorship in America. He wants to rule with tyranny. He promotes violence and division. 

‚ÄúIn the wake of the years of virulent anti-immigrant sentiment, including changes in immigration law to bar residents of many Muslim countries from entry to the United States, tirades against the free press, and, most recently, the sending of federal forces into US cities to counter largely peaceful protests in favor of racial justice, more and more politicians and journalists are using the term ‚Äúfascism‚Äù to describe the threat posed by Trump‚Äôs administration.‚Äù

I post quotes because I know you won‚Äôt go read articles. You can try to convince people we aren‚Äôt headed into a point of no return with Trump but you‚Äôre wrong. You‚Äôre not paying attention to the whole picture. You‚Äôre not grasping the danger and you‚Äôre ignoring the red flags. Wake up.

Is the ruling party corrupt - uhh... Yes. As any of the other parties from the last 30 years. After the collapse of communism all of the newly formed parties were created by people of the still exiting communistic background. So the newly formed constitution and laws to benefit them up to this day. 

So, why protesting now - Bulgarian had 30 years to protest. Because it's not about fixing the system it's about elections. In this September there are small local elections but they are a testing ground for the main parliament elections in March 2021. And before any major Bulgarian election there are protests to ""gather"" the voters. And it's better to have them in Summer than in Winter - you know more people. Also the future parliament will be in charge of distributing the EU Coronavirus subsidies. 

But why so many people in the current protests? You see, at the time when the newly formed constitution was created, the newly formed capitalistic economy was created by people ""trusted"" to the com-party with money from the party itself or stolen from the national budget. Usually, when a ruling party want some money they are shaking some of these old oligarchs with connections to the communist party because the Intelligence Service has everything about them. Like people say - Easy Money!

Unfortunately, the ruling party GERB ""stepped on snek"", earlier this year. They tried to shake Vasil Bozhkov a.k.a ""The Skull"". This MF-er is a Marvel Universe level, Kingpin type of villain. In internal correspondence of the US State Department he was described as ""the most infamous gangster in Bulgaria.""[wikipedia quote]. And his brutality equals his education ‚Äì ""Applied Mathematics"" at Sofia University and ""Labor Economics"" at UNWE. Yep, this kind of super-villain exist in the real world.

So, It was no surprise that after he fled to Dubai to avoid prosecution charges of murder, money laundering, tax evasion and rape. We ended with a huge protests. He has enough money to topple the Queen of England.

OK. Cool, but why the escalation of violence in today's protests. Because of the leader of GERB - Boyko Borisov. He is from the same ""trusted"" guys as Vasil Bozhkov from 30 years ago. And after the quit of his firefighting career to start a security firm. He became bodyguard to two of the most corrupted figures in modern Bulgarian history - the ex-dictator Todor Zhivkov and ex-tsar Simeon II. So, he have learned some tricks from these two. See, when the protests started the leaders of the protests used the typical cliche of "" The political system is corrupt we want to take the power so to create a ""People's Assembly"" and change the constitution. Now, the ""People's Assembly"" is a type of National Assembly with the power, you guess it, to change the constitution. Not a single party wants that because it will change the established methods of corruption. You see, you only need your party to be elected into the National Assembly and this opens the option to ""benefit"" from the established roots. That's why this statement cliche works every single time. If there are normal elections the usual suspects will be elected and everything will go back to ""normal"". But if the elections are for ""People's Assembly"" - every politician loses his mind.

So, how Borisov answer this statement? Did he resign? Well... No. He said something like ""Ok, brah you have it. We are preparing for ""People's Assembly"". We can vote the green light earlier on 4 of September"". That's why we have escalation of violence in today's protests. That's why we have posts about this protests in this subreddit.

So the only question which remains is ""Is the ruling party violates the rights of the protestors?"" The answer is ""No"". Everything was peaceful with little or no provocations from both sides.

They don‚Äôt involve death tolls at all, but are instead focused on masks.  Not sure why you did all that work to bring those up when the conversation is entirely on deaths and comorbidities at this point.

The SWPRS link was interesting, and mentions directly that Covid is currently around the same number of deaths as a strong influenza season.  If the lockdown helped prevent that from ballooning to a much larger number, then it succeeded. That was originally published in May, and shows updates up to today, but does not mention what was updated.  One of the graphics lists deaths around 135,000 for covid in the US.  There was no date on that. 

Sweden is insanely low population density compared to the rest of Europe, but shows seven times the covid deaths as Finland and Norway, who locked down and put in place protective measures and are of similar population density.  CoVid is deadly, I agree with this point.  Thanks for backing it up.

Pennsylvania had &lt;4% of their covid deaths removed after review.  Good, they should strive to be accurate.  Doesn‚Äôt change the numbers much if you apply that to the country.  Makes it a little better, but not great.  About 7,000 deaths nationwide may be misassigned to covid according to that statistic.  Leaves the number at potentially as low as 175,000.

Older people are more susceptible.  Known fact.  Not surprising, not sure why you felt the need to emphasize this?  

Still, 183,000 deaths in the US according to the CDC.  One of the highest in the world.

Not even touching the China related ones.  Good propoganda mining?.

Edit:  Those Sweden numbers actually fit the initial predictions you brought up a while ago really well.

The initial story is what creates 80% of the momentum for outrage in these cases.  Literally when you encounter people on Reddit or in the wild pissed about Breona Taylor, they ALWAYS , and I mean ALWAYS repeat a skewed history of events that results from initial inflamed exaggerations of what happened.

&gt; Warrant had a no-knock provision

Yeah but no one disputes that they knocked.  If they knocked what does that matter?

&gt; It's disputed whether they announced themselves

I agree, though I don't know why whether some particular cops were heard while knocking at midnight on some particular house is worthy of national scandal.

&gt; Walker (boyfriend) fired the first shot based on the reasonable fear that it was intruders

Absolutely, but shooting at cops is absolutely something that will result in return fire.  Are you under the impression that in a country with millions of armed people and a reasonably high rate of crime there won't be any mix-ups where innocent people get tangled up into shootings with cops?

&gt; Officer Hankinson was fired for his improper procedure, firing 10 of the 22 total shots blindly into the apartment

Sounds like the process is working?  I am not defending the officers actions here as perfect.  I am saying they don't constitute some national emergency that requires burning shit down.  A shooting this egregious happens to like 5 people a year, out of hundreds of millions.

&gt; There's evidence that Glover (the actual target) was already in custody, making the event unnecessary

Sort of?  It is not remotely clear there was minute to minute communication, it is not clear that two raid conducted 40 minutes? apart across town should be expected to convey information while they are also searching the homes and securing the scene etc.  But maybe it was necessary and they were just looking for drugs. 

&gt; An innocent person was killed, arguably in a very unnecessary fashion. We're also failing to acknowledge that the principal issue is the lack of response, and of charges being brought, of which there seems to be evidence enough to bring.


&gt; Why did LA burn in 1992 over one man being beaten? You're not seeing the forest for the trees.

Yeah that was stupid too.

&gt; It's also a line of events seemingly to a pattern: that policing is not equitable in its enforcement and application of justice.

Yeah society is not perfectly equal in a wide variety of ways?  But the pattern has been that it is rapidly improving.  Moreover the policing not being equal is 80% due to different behaviors of the populations, not racism, but the story being sold people is it is 100% racism.


&gt; Again missing the forest for the trees. It's not that we shoot criminals, it's that we disproportionately arrest, beat, harass, and kill black Americans. 

We really don't.  I think the data is very clear on this other than harassment.

&gt;Additionally, we seem unwilling to address the socioeconomic issues (that also largely stem from systemic racism) that have a proven causative relationship with crime rates.

We are willing to address them, blacks disproportionately receive huge amounts of federal income, food, and housing assistance.  They also receive preferential treatment in hiring and school admissions, and other things.  Is that racism too?  The idea that we aren't ""willing"" to fix issues is just hilarious.  We spend many billions on it each year, and things are WILDLY better than they were 20 years ago, 40, 60, 80, whatever amount you want to pick.

No the US is not some meritocratic utopia (though honestly that would probably be bad for black people which is why BLM is against meritocracy).  But it is a decent approximation.  If you simply wait to have kids until you are married, or graduate college, and particularly if you do both, your kids are basically in the ""background irrelevant"" utopia everyone claims to want.  And whatever your station/background/obstacles those two things are achievable for 90% of people if they simply do it.  This isn't medieval Europe or 1840s USA.  No one is coming and hunting down some poor kid, black or otherwise who wants to better himself and study and make it out.  The path is easy, there are barely any barriers.

 - Then there's Coptic Cairo, which was mainly from the Roman and Byzantine eras, which is full of churches.

 - Then there's Fustat, which was the first Muslim capital, but doesn't contain much anymore - though it does contain Cairo's oldest mosque.

 - Then there's al-Qata'i, which was founded by Ibn Tulun, and contains the Ibn Tulun Mosque.

 - Then there was al-Qahira - from which we get the name Cairo, founded by the Fatimids. That is now known as the old town of Islamic Cairo. It remained the centre of the city for a thousand years or so, and it's where most of the historic buildings are. 

 - Then there's Downtown Cairo, founded by Ismael Pasha in the 1800s, which looks very European.

Also, your blog post (even if you got a few things wrong, and seem to have entirely missed the fact that this whole thing started because you *stole something*) answers most of your questions. 

&gt;	on what legal basis can file-sharing lawyer attackers can ~~bully internet subscribers (offenders)~~ prosecute people who infringe their clients' copyright? 

I fixed your sentence for you. The answer is dead easy: [¬ß106 Urheberrechtsgesetz](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/urhg/__106.html).

&gt;	These private law firms are not mandated by the Government.

No, of course not - this is a civil dispute.

&gt;	I mean precisely on what legal grounds can WF claim such a high fee. 

WF represents the copyright holders, so they are suing you on their behalf.

&gt;	A film movie costs maximum 15‚Ç¨. I imagine a VERY big chunk of the money goes for the so-called lawyer processing fees.

That's irrelevant. You're not being fined for breaking copyright - as you correctly wrote in your blog post, this is an ""out-of-court settlement"": the copyright holders have evidence that you violated their copyright, which they could sue you for. However, trials are expensive and risky (for both parties), so they're offering you a deal: in exchange for them not suing you, you agree to pay them. The amount has nothing to do with the ""damage"" you caused - it's high enough to deter ~~thieves~~ people from ~~stealing~~ breaking copyright in future, but low enough that it doesn't bankrupt people. In the US, such claims are in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. 

&gt;	Streaming is legal as long you only download.

This hasn't been true since 2017, when the European court ruled that it was [clearly illegal](https://www.wbs-law.de/urheberrecht/abmahnung-filesharing/streaming/).

&gt;	I feel all file-sharing cases are ""legal racket"". The lawyer attackers create an industry of imaginary fines and a need for lawyer defenders.

I can‚Äôt follow your reasoning. You broke someone‚Äôs copyright. While the German *Abmahnung* system is definitely not perfect, in this case, it seems to work reasonably well. Small-time offenders like you get a slap on the wrist, which deters them from reoffending, but these fines aren‚Äôt ridiculous like those in the US. 

This is much better than clogging up the court system with tens of thousands of cases, as this would just result even *more* money for the lawyers. In that system, every pirated film would be dragged in front of a court, with lawyers for the media companies and lawyers for the defenders arguing it out. 

I just wish that the media industry understood better that people pirate not just because they‚Äôre cheap, but also because the legal avenues are often fairly consumer-unfriendly. 

I'm going to honest: I don't understand why you went to all this trouble. You clearly violated their copyright, and were caught.

Are you trying to be funny?

Of course the results from experiments change over time to reflect an average. That‚Äôs just how things work. The average acceleration on earth due to gravity is 9.8 m/s but it‚Äôs not constant. 

The average human supposedly has an IQ of 110 in the United States, although what that actually means is not well understood yet. 

You do understand how averages work right? Pick a thing to measure, say height of living humans, and start measuring. Then just keep measuring as long as humans are alive. 

Do you expect the average to stay the same? No. Environmental pressures and societal preferences will alter human height over time. 

Are we most likely moving towards a ‚Äúmore average‚Äù human as globalization continues? Maybe. I don‚Äôt know. Seems likely, and would be beneficial in replenishing genetic diversity in people of European / Asiatic decent. 

While recorded averages will shift over time, they will ultimately ‚Äúsettle‚Äù into larger averages. For example the ‚Äúgravitational constant‚Äù. For general intents and purposes, except the testing of gravitational fluctuation, the acceleration of an object in Earth‚Äôs gravitational field is 9.8m/s

This will remain the same until a large amount of Earth is removed. Only then, assuming we somehow survive, would we be able to measure a new gravitational constant. 

Despite that being a potential I will continue to walk around as though I can expect a gravitational constant of 9.8m/s. 

The weirdness we see in quantum mechanics really doesn‚Äôt matter in day to day life. It doesn‚Äôt appear to be scaleable, meaning the ‚Äúlaws‚Äù we see in the natural world can be expected to continue to function as observed. 

There is no need for an explanation of how the natural world or its laws came to be. One day we may know, but it really isn‚Äôt important in day to day life.

So much of this seems self-evident to me so I didn't feel inclined to provide examples. You can easily search google for countless examples of people being arrested in Europe for hate-speech. People who did not incite violence in anyway. This emerging trend has swept Europe which is very influential on the American left, giving me a reason to believe that it's coming in the US. The officially accepted and only permitted narrative in the US and Europe regarding Islam is that it is a ""religion of peace"". This is unequivocally false and anyone who has read the Quran knows that. The constant use of the term ""racist"" to demonize and shut down people with totally rational critiques of Islam or other religions is what I'm talking about. Anyone who acknowledges the consistently observed empirical reality of IQ disparities between races/ethnicities is demonized as a racist even if they haven't said anything remotely hateful. So much as acknowledging that race exists at all can get you shunned in many academic circles.

---I mean, that's kind of. A non argument isn't it? ""If they had power"" is you putting ideals in their mouths that they didn't. I'm more likely to hear the left protecting the first amendment than the right. I've literally heard the right wing calling for cessation in the first amendment rights of a LOT of people recently, so when I say things like that I can bring up specific examples where highly influential individuals on the right have floated things like making flag burning illegal, or protesting illegal, or restrictions on the press.

It is genuinely mind-blowing to hear anyone say the left is more pro-first amendment. Their incessant use of the term ""hate-speech"" as distinguished from ""speech"" by itself reveals their hostility to ideas they don't want to deal with. You almost never hear American conservatives use this asinine term. You can't deny the pathological over-sensitivity to alternative points of view on college campuses and other forums across the US. If I actually have to give you examples and explain that to you, you will never change your mind. Leftist censorship is absolutely ubiquitous. If I rationally and peacefully criticize or make an off-color joke about Black Lives Matter, Feminism, Islam, Trans people, or other cultures there is a significant chance that my reputation will never recover because I've been dubbed the modern equivalent of a heretic; a racist, misogynist, transphobic, Islamaphobic, xenophobic, violence and hatred-inciting, far-right, fringe extremist. Just for having the wrong opinion I am condemned. So many good people have endured this treatment and you know it. This is entirely a product of the left. 
Give me a single example, that isn't some random person on Facebook, in the last ten years of any popular conservative advocating for genuine restrictions on the press or protesting. I haven't heard anyone in years talk about Flag-Burning as an issue. I'm talking about the right in 2020. I guarantee the vast majority of conservatives, having known them and listened to them my whole life despite not being one, don't care about flag-burning and they consider freedom of the press and the right to protest essential to their American principles. Please give me examples of the right recently threatening free speech, with the admitted exception of trying to limit the criticism of Israel.


""There are a myriad of different opinions that are almost completely forbidden in modern American academia,""

---Like?

Ideas that challenge virtually any aspect of feminism/gender studies, the biological reality that there are fundamentally two sexes, Islam being anything but wonderful and peaceful, the idea that capitalism is a positive thing, the idea that America is not systemically racist, the fact that people of all races can be racist. If you want me to get more specific I could go on for hours.

---Like the American left? Actual leftists? Socialists even? Because they're very underrepresented in popular media except for depictions of authoritarian Communism.

All of the above. The left completely dominates popular media! The advertising industry, Hollywood, internet tech companies, and news media are all wildly statistically left-leaning and constantly talk about the evils of capitalism (while benefiting from it) while almost never mentioning the evils of Socialism/Communism in the last ten years. Why do you think so many young people identify as socialists? 

---Fair enough, what material reasons do you have for that or is it just feelings? If it isn't specific actions or promises, what makes you feel that way? And who stands to benefit from people like you feeling that way?

The blatantly obvious and overwhelming hostility towards peaceful discourse occurring in media and academia. A huge portion of the left's total inability to defend their position and their resulting dependence on mindless character attacks. I'm not suggesting that the right never does this but they are infinitely more civilized and willing to have a conversation than most people in the modern American left. This is abstract and difficult to prove but it seems undeniable to me. All of humanity, including people on the left, stands to benefit from people advocating for freedom of expression and a willingness to listen to others as a social value, and not just a law.

---So it's an issue, ONLY when it happens to people you agree with? That just sounds like tribalism.
---I mean, that's social pressure and has and will exist forever UNLESS you remove people's freedom of speech.

Holy shit dude. You could not have more blatantly mischaracterized what I was saying if you tried. Social shaming is necessary to disincentivize universally undesirable behavior like killing, raping, and stealing. We have to condemn and shame people when they're genuinely evil, but not when they simply hold different opinions. I understand that this is an inescapable part of life but the left's incessant willingness to shame people purely and entirely because they hold different opinions is a relatively recent phenomenon in the US and Europe, places where people formerly had more of a mutual respect for their political opponents. 

---Yup, can't argue with that. Sometimes it's from the left and other times from the right. This kind of social pressure is not unique to either side of the spectrum.

I wasn't talking about social shaming anymore, I'm talking about nearly every major tech company being overwhelmingly left-leaning and censoring thousands of libertarians and conservatives while the left can say literally anything no matter how hateful and dishonest it is as long as it falls in line with their world-view. As private companies they have every legal right to do this, but it's still reprehensible and antithetical to human progress to censor ideas. This is my greatest argument. Youtube, Facebook, Google, Apple, Twitter, and Reddit are all run by admitted left-leaning people that shut down debate and wrongthink all the time, every day. Censorship is a defining characteristic of the modern left. I know from constant experience that people on the right mostly want to dissect and debunk the arguments of their opponents. Of course both sides contain masses of people who have nothing of substance to say at all but I'm talking primarily about thought-leaders, journalists, politicians, analysts, and philosophers. The use of character attacks and baseless social shaming is used a hundred times more by the left. The right definitely uses bullshit manipulative tactics like everyone as you said, but nowhere near as consistently as the left.

---If they don't agree BUT are pro first amendment rights then why don't they speak against them? Isn't it their duty as those in charge of keeping the first amendment safe to make sure that laws like that NEVER come into play?

Yes. It is. I have nothing to say in defense of that law or anyone who supports it. As far as I can tell, that is an anomaly. Leftist censorship is the rule, conservative censorship is the exception. I don't think that specific law is very well known either. I encourage you to ask conservatives if they agree with it.

Russia and China want the war to last a long time so they‚Äôll support any side that‚Äôs losing and that‚Äôll be the dems. Republicans will have the support of Israel, Brazil, The UAE, and all the Eastern European countries. Saudi Arabia will probably also support the republicans. Regardless the Navy will be in republican hands and will blockade the coasts. 

The major issue will be extremist groups like the far left and far right. They‚Äôll spring up in western us democrat controlled areas. Antifa could very well try and take Portland. Atomwaffen and all the other far right groups would probably join together. This chaos would lead to the civil war being more devastating. 

The dems will lose.


As for the election Biden is not going to win. The opinions of reddit are left wing because they are manufactured to be so.

Have you heard Biden talk? Most leftist won‚Äôt support the dems they‚Äôll support actual far left groups like black bloc and Antifa. Antifa doesn‚Äôt like Joe Biden.

-Was everything about his lifestyle 'traditional' in that they hunted/foraged for their own food spending 8+ hours a day walking?

-Did they have access to any post industrialization foods like refined grains, corn fed chicken/pork, vegetable oils?

-Did your friend ever experience any confounding variables like obesity, smoking, drinking, drug-use ect?

Didn't have a chance to clean the mess properly until day 4 in the evening. My ass was sealed shut (not just the hole, but the cheeks) and I had to rip it open inch by inch in the bathtub. Long asshair made it worse.

To add to the misery, I forced myself not to go to toilet for a few days because of this traumatic incident. My bowel hurt like hell and as I finally went to the shitter, the clog almost tore my ass apart.

It was in Europe (Austria) and we were hiking mostly through snowy forests and on mountains, so it was pretty friggin cold.

I had a bad stomach virus a week before, but I thought it was over. Turns out it wasn't over completely, and around 4 to 5 hours after starting the trip, my stomach and anus decided in unity ""WHATEVER IT TAKES, OPEN THE GATES"".

It was very loud and everybody (3 guys and 2 girls, one of which I had a crush on) heard it.
We laughed it off but my head got so hot from the embarrassment that it felt like summer.

First I thought maybe it was just a ""wet fart"", but then I slowly felt that my head wasn't the only thing that got warm.

So what were my options?

Turn back? 
Too far away already and I would get lost alone.

Stop and clean it?
I had one roll of asspaper, it wasn't enough to clean my ass and trousers and the embarrassment would have killed me.

Stop at a river and clean it there? 
I don't hang my balls into icy water, and I didn't want to remove all the diarrhea with my hands. 

So I just moved on with the group.

Fortunately, I had a tent for myself and for some reason nobody smelled anything or brought the topic up again. Maybe they DID smell it but didn't say it?
All those questions in my head led to the decision of doom not to do anything about it the whole trip. It was a nightmare, I couldn't sleep well.

I got rid of the shit-trousers at night (threw them up a tree, took 4 tries). Icing on the cake would have been, if someone asked ""sup with the wack trousers up that tree?"" but nobody seen it.

Not too sure what happened in Portland, the cleanest video I saw is just bizarre. How did they know he was a trump supporter? I saw no red hat. Part of me wonders if there was a shooting at all, if it was random (guy talking about getting paid and licks, which around here means stealing stuff. Makes me think armed robbery), it‚Äôs just odd that no one in the video initially seems to react to a guy firing off a pistol on a relatively busy street. My guess is, dude wanted to rob a guy, robber draws, guy tries to mace him, drawing what the robber thinks is a gun, robber fires. Combined with the Kenosha stuff though, it really all feels intentional to further divide. Hell, Kyle might be CIA with shot placement and presence of mind like that.

&gt;We are not a hivemind. Suffering, as all feeling, happens on the individual level. Let‚Äôs not restrict our imaginations to the struggles faced by a racial group, there are only like five of those and individuals suffer in many ways.

This is a deflection. We can talk about the suffering of othe individuals when the discussion is ABOUT THEM. 

I am disabled and I experience daily pain.

This isn't about me. It's about black people collectively.

Not about individuals it's about groups.  

&gt;It was in this case, but there are many ways it can happen. This is also true in Europe, where they didn‚Äôt have slavery. Just because it started with an injustice doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs an injustice now. Nobody abused your rights if you were born poor, no matter the reason. 

This is a super weird oversimplification. do you mean the UK? Or the EU which includes a myriad of european countries with varying ethno demographics? 

Either way, comparing eurocentric countries and looking at their population and saying ""see there are still poor black people"" is not a great argument and is kind of silly. 

I never made the argument that ""Only slavery causes poverty"" anyway. 

Just that it was a unique cause of inequity among black people in the United States today.

That's true regardless of what's up in Europe.

&gt;I‚Äôm sure you would think that if you didn‚Äôt read anything I said correctly.

I think I've been beyond gracious in reading and responding to your POV. Implying I'm reading it incorrectly is shitty. And I'm not btw. You've moved the goalposts a few times now. 

We started at : 

""Yes black people today face a unique disadvantage because slavery and then years of law"" 

then when challenged you switched to:

""Well it's not unique""

And then

""even if it is everyone has problems."" 

Well which is it? You can't have it every which way. 

If slavery and then years of policy and law don't explain inequity between ethnogroups then what does? 




&gt;Of course they‚Äôd agree, you‚Äôd literally be bribing them to.

Helping people isn't a bribe. Is social security a bribe? Was covid relief a bribe? 

&gt;Inequality is not a crime. Poverty can happen to you because your ancestors were slaves, or because they were immigrants, or because your parents were drug addicts, or because they died. Nobody is owed inheritance, and it is not a ‚Äúproblem‚Äù to be ‚Äúfixed‚Äù that more white people inherit stuff than black people.

&gt;So yes, the origins of this ‚Äúinequality‚Äù do not matter, morally. The birth lottery isn‚Äôt fair in the first place, that it‚Äôs unequal by race is just part and parcel of the game

Never said it was a crime. 

And again, to an individual the cause of poverty might mlbe irrelevant.

 We are talking about a particular GROUP that are the descendents of slaves in the US who gave a unique disadvantage. 

And

Just because an inequity is ""part of the game"" doesn't mean we shouldnt try and fix it.

Do you think government funded ramps for wheelchairs are unfair to everybody else? 

You mentioned welfare. Is welfare somehow unfair to everyone? Or is welfare ""just part of the game"" so it's cool?

How about covid-relief? Many people received assistance? ""Part of the game""? Or no? 

All I'm hearing is that you're fine with picking and choosing what disadvantages YOU think are ok to tackle. What disadvantages YOUVE deemed tragic enough to be ok with our country working towards solving. 

You've been whining about everyone having disadvantages at birth (not the point btw) and that's ""part of the game"" all the while the truth is that we do solve for many of those disadvantages already via socio-economic programs in the US. Are those programs bad now?

&gt;There are way too many factors to say passing gun laws equals a rise/lowering of crime/gun deaths. 

Hey, good strawman. That‚Äôs not what I said. I‚Äôm not attributing correlation to causation. I‚Äôm just going to present some data that shows ‚ÄúHey; your gun laws didn‚Äôt actually do what you claim they did.‚Äù

&gt;So when you say "" After passing their gun laws (in all cases), gun violence, mass violence, and school shootings went up by anywhere from 200% - 450%"". We both know that is complete bullshit. 

No, actually we both don‚Äôt. Because I have the incident list readily available to prove it.

&gt;The main factors of crime (thus gun crime) are social economic factors, with the main cause being poverty. If someone is really poor they are much more willing to do a crime. Which can be seen in my above linked article, where most of the highest gun homicide countries are ones of poorer countries.

I‚Äôm not arguing against socioeconomic factors, in fact I would call you a fool if you believed they didn‚Äôt contribute. I would also call you a fool for insisting that they are the *only* contributing factors.

&gt;The stability of a country matters, except for the USA, most of the top gun homicide countries aren't the most stable country.

So let‚Äôs talk about fair comparisons. When we compare any country with 330m population to a country with 5m population. We aren‚Äôt being honest or arguing in good faith.

It‚Äôs actually much more honest to compare the USA to Europe as a whole. The data is seen in good faith this way. 50 countries, 50 states. Roughly the same population, and also roughly the same coverage of land mass.

When we do the comparison this way, we see that *no*, Europe is not much better than the USA. On *any* problem to be exact.

&gt;Back to your comment of ""passing their gun laws"". What does that even mean? Does that mean mandatory training laws? Or background checks? If you wanting to make sweeping comments of ""gun laws"", then that's going to result in you getting owned by gotcha's.

Well why don‚Äôt we let the data do the talking.

Please stand by. I take no credit for the hard work this individual did to comprise this list or the countless hours he spent compiling it.

Here‚Äôs Germany.

‚ÄúThe 49 Mass Shootings, 41 Mass Murders, and 6 school shootings in Germany since their 2003 gun laws

Using Google, Bing, Murderpedia, a paid subscription to TheLocal.de, Wikipedia's Massacres, terrorism, and familicide pages I was able to find 49 mass shootings since their **2003 Weapons Act**. This law was specifically to address school shootings and rampage\\active shooters in response to the Freising Rampage and Erfurt School Massacre. The new laws included: background check extending into political &amp; foreign affiliation and non-violent offenses, psychological screening, requiring membership in hunting or sport shooting club, testing proficiency, storage &amp; security at home (if allowed), minors handling &amp; training with licensed professionals instead of parents, sport shooters had to be 21 now, sport shooting have to be a member of club for 1 year first, 6 month waiting period in between purchases (maximum 2 at a time). All these shootings have 4 or more victims in one setting, session, incident or incidents without the FBI's ""cooling off period"" in between. And you should all be able to find multiple sources if you Google or Bing them. Many of these are in German so you‚Äôll need to use Google or Bing translate. Hopefully this can aid in correcting the misinformation that Germany is devoid of mass shootings or that the laws they enacted in response to the Erfurt Massacre in 2002 were effective. Feel free to correct any mistakes I've made. Or to let me know of any incidents I've missed.

&amp;#x200B;

Link to downloadable doc of all lists mentioned:    [http://www.filedropper.com/germanymassshootings-copy2](http://www.filedropper.com/germanymassshootings-copy2)

&amp;#x200B;

The most amazing things I found out were:

&amp;#x200B;

\#1 Germany had only 17 mass shootings in the 16 years before, and then 49 after their 2003 laws.

A 188% INCREASE in mass shooting incidents. 

Like Canada, Australia, UK, South Africa, France, and Argentina, Germany rarely had mass shootings before their strict gun laws. Then saw a significant INCREASE after. In each instance they had more mass shootings incidents after implementing strict gun control.   

&amp;#x200B;

\#2 Germany has had 41 mass murders since their **2003 Weapons Act** went into effect, and only had 18 in the 16 years before. 

A 128% INCREASE in mass murder incidents. 

\*\*\*Most of them are not on Wikipedia‚Äôs Massacres pages

&amp;#x200B;

\#3 Germany went from having 4 school shootings in the 16 years before , to having 6 school shootings since 2003. 

A 50% INCREASE in school shooting incidetns.  

&amp;#x200B;

\#4 Like France, when I started searching in German I found exponentially more mass shootings and mass murders. The English speaking media simply does not cover most of these tragedies so it gives the impression that it never happens in Germany or is much more rare than it is.

4A) German media is very different than America, UK, Australia, France, etc‚Ä¶ They go out of their way to not make celebrities of School Shooters, Mass Murderers, Serial Killers, Terrorists, etc‚Ä¶ You don‚Äôt see their faces and their names are not published. In fact, there was outrage in Germany when the UK media put the Winnenden School Shooter‚Äôs face and name everywhere. 

4B) While searching in German, I inadvertently found more mass shootings and mass murders in France. It seems like German and French media often throw shade on one another while portraying their own country as safer and more reasonable. Both cover American tragedies extensively and are very critical of American culture. 

&amp;#x200B;

\#5 I am aware that most of these are not listed in Wikipedia. That‚Äôs one of the primary reasons while I started compiling my own lists. In fact, it‚Äôs kind of the main point. Gun Control advocates and Neutral curious parties are getting the wrong impression from Wikipedia. Mass shootings and school shootings happen outside the USA much more frequently then the media presents. These things are not unique to America. And are in fact not unique or even rare in the developed world at all. Wikipedia does not list most of these and people should know. No matter what side of the debate you‚Äôre on. 

5A) Many of these also only have sources in German. Once again that is the point. That there is no English American or even English speaking media coverage of these events. Thus creating the false impression that they don‚Äôt happen in Germany. 

&amp;#x200B;

\#6 Also like France there were many gruesome instances of men murdering their entire families. Most of them are triple homicides that don‚Äôt rise to the level of mass murder events (4 dead). But many did kill 4 or more people and are included on the Mass Murders list I created. 

6A) Unlike France and much like Australia, there wasn‚Äôt the occasional female perpetrator. 

6B) Often, one family member will be left alive &amp; unharmed. The murders will occur when one sibling or the mother is out or away from home. This is unique compared to other countries. And I can‚Äôt imagine how that would effect the surviving sibling or mother.  

6C) Also like France, but unlike Australia, many of Germany‚Äôs family killings featured a Middle Aged or Elderly man killing his parents then himself. Those were usually triple murders not included on the mass murders list. 

6D) Just like France and Australia, it seems to happen in bunches over the course of a few months to a year. Then goes a way for a couple of years, then happens again. It starts up randomly, then plays out over a few or several months. One after another. There are many articles about it in the German media. There were quite a few Australian articles about it too, and some in the French media. 

6E) I can‚Äôt help but think of the clusters of school and mass shootings that happen in the USA. One killer commits his heinous act and then shortly after another one follows suit. Then yet another and so on. Mass murder appears as a contagion when you list it in sequential order. In the USA people go into schools and do these things. In Australia, France, and Germany these men go home. A man feels like a failure then takes the life of his wife or ex wife and children. Then kills himself most of the time. Is it just like when a young man in USA feels like a failure then goes into his school or ex-school and takes the lives of his classmates? Then kills himself with Death by Cop. It seems remarkably similar. Are the schools of America the equivalent sacred safe space that the family home is in Germany, Australia, or France? In the minds of Schizophrenics or Psychotics, does being a failure as a father &amp; provider in Germany equate to being a high school reject in America? Does Germany provide an effective support system for mentally unstable teenagers and young men that then ceases when they become adults in the work force? Perhaps causing  them to act out much later than struggling American teenagers and young adults.‚Äù

It's been incredible frustrating to watch how politicians have actively worked to create an ethnic under-class saying how it's such a great boon for the country. Outright lies about immigrants education levels (and ignoring false equivalences between the quality of education vis-a-vi Swedish and for example Syrian medical training), the usual semantics game where they claim that there aren't that many immigrants arriving (some of them are refugees, now a days the bulk of the immigration are with family ties, so that's yet another different statistic (according to whoever it gains, that is)). The classic lying by omission. 

Sorry, sort of ranting here, I could probably write a whole book about everything that is rotten in the state of Sweden. 

So I guess what I've been trying to convey is that there are a lot of reasons a gay person in Sweden might support the ""far right"" and that the bulk of the Sweden democrats and other players on the ""far right"" are disillusioned people from both the left and the right, with the bulk coming from the traditional ""conservative party"" (let's say I don't find unchecked (my own hyperbole) immigration with a lax stand on welfare qualification a conservative policy) and almost a many from the social democrats who since long abandoned Swedish workers in favor of high minded international ideals (some sort of international workers solidarity movement that completely went off the rails).

Coveiro segura foto de homem que morreu de coronav√≠rus durante enterro em cemit√©rio de Nova Igua√ßu, no Rio de Janeiro 20/08/2020 REUTERS/Pilar Olivares

O pa√≠s registrou na √∫ltima semana epidemiol√≥gica m√©dia de mortes por Covid-19 inferior a 900 por dia --a menor em tr√™s meses e meio--, sinalizando que pode estar, finalmente, descendo de um prolongado plat√¥ que o colocou como segundo do mundo com maior n√∫mero de √≥bitos pela doen√ßa.

Uma an√°lise dos dados do Minist√©rio da Sa√∫de feita pela Reuters apontou que as 6.212 mortes da semana epidemiol√≥gica encerrada no s√°bado representam o menor n√∫mero semanal desde a semana encerrada em 16 de maio, quando foram notificados 5.006 √≥bitos. Nesse intervalo, o Brasil ingressou em um chamado plat√¥, incluindo 13 semanas consecutivas com m√©dia de mortes semanal ao redor de 1.000 por dia.

Ainda assim, foram quase 890 mortes por dia em m√©dia por Covid-19 na semana, o que demonstra o enorme desafio que o pa√≠s ainda tem pela frente para controlar a epidemia.

‚ÄúEstamos em uma descendente em rela√ß√£o ao plat√¥ alto anterior. Entretanto, ainda s√£o n√∫meros elevados e temos que manter a vigil√¢ncia para que este n√∫mero n√£o volte a crescer‚Äù, alertou o infectologista Roberto Medronho, professor da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade Federal do Rio e Janeiro e l√≠der do Grupo de Trabalho Multidisciplinar para Enfrentamento da Covid-19 da UFRJ.

O decl√≠nio recente decorre, na avalia√ß√£o de especialistas ouvidos pela Reuters, principalmente da pr√≥pria tend√™ncia da epidemia de se estabilizar ap√≥s se espalhar com for√ßa por todas as regi√µes do pa√≠s, a um enorme custo humano no caso do Brasil.

Epidemiologistas avaliam que a situa√ß√£o brasileira √© um alerta para outros pa√≠ses emergentes que enfrentam uma eleva√ß√£o de casos do v√≠rus, como M√©xico e √çndia.

‚ÄúO Brasil √© um caso de alerta‚Äù, disse Albert Ko, professor da Escola de Sa√∫de P√∫blica de Yale, que tem d√©cadas de experi√™ncia sobre o Brasil. Segundo o professor, a epidemia chegou com for√ßa ao Brasil, ‚Äúe interven√ß√µes baseadas em evid√™ncias em muitos lugares n√£o foram implementadas ou feitas corretamente‚Äù.

O isolamento social, apontado como principal ferramenta para conter a dissemina√ß√£o do v√≠rus, uma vez que n√£o existe vacina at√© o momento, tem se mantido baixo, diante da crescente press√£o econ√¥mica pela retomada das atividades.

Uma an√°lise da Reuters de dados de mobilidade do Google, que utiliza informa√ß√µes de movimenta√ß√£o de telefones celulares e as compara com o n√≠vel pr√©-pandemia, mostrou uma queda brusca do distanciamento desde abril.

O n√∫mero de pessoas indo e voltando de locais de trabalho no Brasil, por exemplo, foi de uma redu√ß√£o de 37,8% em abril, na compara√ß√£o com o √≠ndice pr√©-pandemia, para uma diminui√ß√£o de apenas 16% em agosto. O movimento no transporte p√∫blico tamb√©m aumentou significativamente, de acordo com os dados.

‚ÄúTemos que trabalhar, pois pagamos aluguel e o custo de vida √© bem caro aqui no Rio‚Äù, disse a gar√ßonete Patr√≠cia Lima, que depois de ficar tr√™s meses em casa, voltou neste m√™s ao restaurante onde trabalha no centro do Rio de Janeiro.

Com a necessidade de pegar dois √¥nibus para sair de uma comunidade na zona oeste at√© o centro da cidade, ela relata uma jornada marcada pelo medo de ser contaminada.

‚ÄúOnde eu moro demora muito para passar √¥nibus, porque diminu√≠ram na pandemia, e chega sempre super lotado‚Äù, disse. ‚ÄúTenho bastante preocupa√ß√£o, √© muito perigoso, as pessoas ficam sem m√°scara no √¥nibus.‚Äù

A baixa ades√£o ao isolamento √© considerada a principal respons√°vel pela longa dura√ß√£o do plat√¥, na avalia√ß√£o de especialistas, e cenas de aglomera√ß√£o como as registradas em praias do Rio de Janeiro no domingo colocam em risco a tend√™ncia de queda.

As medidas de isolamento voltadas a diminuir a transmiss√£o do v√≠rus foram afrouxadas em praticamente todo o pa√≠s diante da press√£o econ√¥mica e da posi√ß√£o do presidente Jair Bolsonaro, que sempre se mostrou contr√°rio √†s quarentenas e criticou governadores e prefeitos que as decretaram.

Com restaurantes, bares, academias e shoppings abertos, o coronav√≠rus encontrou terreno f√©rtil para avan√ßar pelo pa√≠s, que fica atr√°s apenas dos Estados Unidos como o mais afetado do mundo, com mais de 3,8 milh√µes de casos confirmados e quase 121 mil mortes at√© domingo.

‚ÄúSe a pol√≠tica do governo federal fosse distanciamento social como come√ßou em mar√ßo, os Estados n√£o teriam feito as besteiras que fizeram‚Äù, disse Paulo Lotufo, epidemiologista, professor da Faculdade de Medicina da USP, cr√≠tico da reabertura precoce.

Segundo ele, a epidemia j√° poderia ter sido controlada no pa√≠s se as localidades que n√£o foram impactadas no momento de chegada do v√≠rus, como o interior de S√£o Paulo e os Estados do Sul e do Centro-Oeste, tivessem estabelecido quarentenas r√≠gidas antes de serem afetados.

‚ÄúEsses tr√™s locais basicamente tiveram a pandemia sem precisar ter, se tivessem tomado as medidas corretas, feito um controle adequado e mantido por mais um per√≠odo, teriam evitado e o Brasil estaria em uma situa√ß√£o melhor‚Äù, acrescentou.

Nesta segunda-feira, a Organiza√ß√£o Mundial da Sa√∫de (OMS) alertou que a retomada das atividades econ√¥micas sem ter o v√≠rus sob controle √© a ‚Äúreceita para o desastre‚Äù.

‚ÄúA gente precisa deixar claro que flexibiliza√ß√£o n√£o significa normaliza√ß√£o, volta √† vida anterior sem medidas de preven√ß√£o, com aglomera√ß√£o, sem m√°scara, porque isso √© menosprezar o esfor√ßo de milh√µes de pessoas que est√£o cumprindo o isolamento social h√° meses e, ainda pior, banalizar as milhares de vidas que j√° foram perdidas para a Covid-19‚Äù, disse Alexandre Naime, chefe do departamento de Infectologia da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade Estadual Paulista (Unesp).

Hmmm if you‚Äôre gonna talk about big oil, might as well wonder that just as much as oil, lithium also exists in quantities, you wanna know why lithium is not suitable ? Because to get lithium, you have to go through mining.

So lemme give you an example, your smartphone contains copper, for copper to exist you have to either blow entire sections of the amazon rainforest (in order to mine it), polluting thousands of square kilometers of rainforest, or you gotta exploit Nigerian/African kids to get copper from African dictatorships (I hope it‚Äôs worth virtue signaling through the blood of a smart phone)...

So once again... you wanna lecture me about the impact of climate change while clearly being manipulated by a clearly politicized narrative that conveniently doesn‚Äôt see that the mining industry  and the cosmetics industry (which has to deforest entire regions of Southeast Asia for *very meaningful things like makeup*)  are the biggest responsible for climate change (and funny that you‚Äôre supporting mining industry yet virtue signaling) 

I could care less about oil, it‚Äôs an outdated method that should only be used to make certain plastics... unfortunately, if you‚Äôre gonna complain about big oil, might also complain about ‚Äúbig mining‚Äù something that not even the most crazy critics of big oil even dare to say a word

**East Germany:**  
As mentioned, Germany was allowed to keep Silesia and Pommerania ITTL. To compensate, the Poles were given former Koenigsberg instead of the region becoming part of the USSR proper. The East Germans have their capital in Berlin and have actually fortified this worlds Iron Curtain long ago, due to Soviets having disagreements with their former allies. The Stasi is still a thing here, keeping an eye on the East German population. Economically, the country is doing far better than our GDR, not having lost large parts of it¬¥s industry or population displaced.  


**West Germany:**  
In this world, Frankfurt actually did become the capital of West Germany, as West Berlin never came under combined American/British/French control. Capitalist and nowadays a member of NATO, the allies are propping up it¬¥s military out of paranoia. Relations towards their eastern neighbours are even chillier than in OTL and fears of the Soviets marching across the border are at an all time high. Other than that, the country is relatively free and is experiencing a similar liberalization under British/French supervision.  


**South Germany:**  
Got off really lucky in this universe. Having been formed out of Austria, the American occupation zone and parts of the southern French one, this Germany took on the role of a neutral nation similar to Switzerland. Secretly, they support NATO and are biased towards the capitalist West. Nowadays they are pretty rich, with the capital city of Munich attracting a good amount of tourists again.

And these relationships hardly affect elections until they hit the economy. I am not asking Erdogan or his sisters to insult or threaten people, right? I don't... Almost 60% of Turkey is not voting for him, right? It is... It is a whole country thing now? What I meant is, this problem exists for more than 30 years...

Lots of mistakes we have done... Turks and Greeks... I can count lots of mistakes of Mitsotakis (must be at the beginning 90s) , Andreas &amp; George Papandreou, Konstantinos Simitis, etc. Do you really think that your politicians are angels? Let me give you some examples about politicians and people. If you want more, I can tell you the whole story of the last 25-30 years. And the incidents I have seen.

I am living shores of Aegean sea... I believe you don't remember how you provoked Turks in Imia Crisis all of sudden while there is no problem around and also shot a Turkish F-16 during the incidents.  A fucking idiot (Bill Clinton) made fun of both Turks and Greeks because of that incident... He just told us ""don't just  fight for a few sheep in the rocks."" and that idiot said something more clever than Greek and Turkish politicians.

These problems are not new at all. I am eye-witness most of the incidents last 30 years and I know these problems exist longer than it.  Do you think you didn't threat to Turkey? Your ex-chief of staff just told ""We will destroy Turks"" and such... Panayiotopulos also told that they are ready to resolve the problem with force just recently? Weren't you the one who has crumbled the Turkish flag in the European Parliament... This wasn't disrespect to Turkish politicians though. It was disrespectful to the Turkish people. If you tell me don't blame politicians for such incidents, should I accuse Greek people about it? It doesn't sound nonsense?  There are also more... Do you want older incidents? So I can tell... Want newer, I can also tell them too. However, I can also tell you the mistakes of the Turkish government too that I already told both sides are responsible for it.

Do you think that Turks only one who are violating airspace? You guys keep talking like Turks are always doing it but it is actually mutual. One of my relatives (f 16 pilot) has told me it was something common between Greeks and Turks for years ago. Now you are ONLY accusing Turks with the things that you also keep doing.

I have even heard from my Norwegian friend that you guys told him ""Don't go to Turkey, they are going to rape you and your family there"" just last year in a Greek Island... :D + This is not the only one Greek story I have heard about Turks...

If you think that Turks want a war with Greece, you are wrong. However, instead of hearing stuff from one-sided media, the internet, or TV, I would prefer to read things from the books. If I haven't done it, you will already find a nationalist who blames only the Greek side for it now.

The worst thing about this is that the best parts of capitalism, the efficiency and encouragement for individuals to excel, invent new things, start companies, etc, all break down in a highly unequal system.

The trouble is that, without state intervention, capitalism will naturally degenerate itself to a form where it isn't even functional for it's alleged purpose anyway, like in the USA. Capitalism is based off the idea of efficient markets and rational actors- having a monopolistic market in many sectors and an impoverished, desperate workforce is not exactly an environment overflowing with ""rational, independent actors"".

For the best parts of capitalism to flourish, it has to be properly contained and channeled. If we expect the returns of capitalism to benefit the majority of society, we have to shape a society in which individuals are as close as can be to free, rational actors- well educated, financially stable, free to pick and choose where they live, what they buy, who they work for, whether or not to be entrepreneurs, etc. If individuals are not free to choose these things, due to weak labor laws, inadequate safety nets, low wages and high expenses for daily living....well, you get to where we are now.",True,False,False,,,,0,1599073248,,False,0,{},g3r5q2m,False,t3_il4evc,False,True,t1_g3qb4ll,/r/worldnews/comments/il4evc/china_censors_thomas_pikettys_book_that_touches/g3r5q2m/,False,,1611530892,4,True,False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,r/worldnews,public,,0,[],

See figure 3 on Tom Brown's blog post, where he shows how much baseload plants alone are ill-suited for seasonal demand (starting at ""Take heating:"").

Tom Brown is using questionable assumptions about nuclear. In his study regarding  ""Response to 'Burden of proof: A comprehensive review of the feasibility of 100% renewable-electricity systems"" He dismisses nuclear as an alternative because thermal fission cannot power the world 100%, and says breeder reactors aren't ready. Both silly arguments because no one is purposing 100% nuclear powered world. He also claims nuclear power promotes nuclear proliferation, which is silly as you don't need nuclear power at all to get nuclear weapons. He's in the same league as Jacobson in that regard, and everything he says regarding nuclear should be taken with a huge grain of salt.

&gt; Also note that a mix of renewables and nuclear reduce the capacity factor of nuclear and increases their LCOE. Since Europe will have a large amount of renewables (that's no longer negotiable), this needs to be accounted for.

This applies to renewables as well, also, looking at [system LCOE](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360544213009390) for renewables show a cost doubling at only 30-35% penetration, which is not something you see for nuclear, as the only thing really reducing nuclear revenue will be lower capacity factor caused by load-following.

&gt; The only counter example would be the portion of new renewables that was used to replace German nuclear plants before their end of life. The rest is a net carbon cut.

The added renewable capacity far, far exceeded the nuclear capacity retired - yet you don't see the rapid decarbonisation you talk about - there is no exponential decarbonization going on in Germany now.",True,False,False,,,,0,1599073341,,False,0,{},g3r5zkv,False,t3_ii2ksb,False,False,t1_g3r1t12,/r/Futurology/comments/ii2ksb/bill_gates_nuclear_venture_plans_reactor_to/g3r5zkv/,False,,1611531019,1,True,False,Futurology,t5_2t7no,r/Futurology,public,,0,[],

Oscar was also highly rated when he signed for us. Even Mourinho wanted him. Mata had already exceeded expectations, kinda like Pulisic this season.

Totally agree with you here.

I was in the same boat, but the recent scandals changed that. I was of the mind that at least Boyko was showing some driver for defending Bulgarian interests on the global stage.

Why would you think that? There is more support for DB than ever. They are the only real opposition currently in Bulgaria. And I really believe that most polls are sued against them.

Yes. It all sounds like, smells like and tastes like mafia war. But also it's a distraction. I don't mean that it's not real, but that it doesn't matter. It's not whats important. At least not for the current political crisis.  

&gt;It's just that I focused more on the political sides (which is important  because they'll be the ones forming the next government) than the  people and what they have to protest about.

I genuinely don't think you could find more than 10 within the last month, and more than 100 within the last year ‚Äî keep in mind the pandemic and I still don't think you could get to 100 within the past 12 months. Dog bites man isn't a story, man bites dog is.








Using these outliers to try to make a point is ridiculous because we have access to data which while taking into account all outliers, also takes into account everything else. You have access to the same data I do, you can find it easily ‚Äî so why would you point to outliers instead of the actual data? What's your motivation here?




&gt;We just need to have them means tested so those that can pay do and those that cant dont need to.




We already pay for the care with our taxes. People shouldn't be getting double charged for their healthcare, that's literally part of why America's system is so bad, their tax dollars go to subsidised healthcare that they never get to benefit from it. It's unironically taxation without representation.










&gt;Well then lets hope Trump gets his second term so he can force through his drug price reduction stuff. Hell he already put in an executive order to help diabetics in low income areas get their insulin cheaper. The insurance system doesnt help with the insurers artificially inflating costs and passing them along to the patients via huge copay prices. People that opt to pay cash often spend much much less on procedures than they would spend on the copay for an insurer covered procedure. The US system needs a major overhaul but going fully state funded will just make for more issues overall.






US drug costs are across the board unreasonably high, you could cut them by 75% and they'd still be like 4x more expensive everywhere else. Insurers artificially inflating costs is literally a problem that you can't solve without getting rid of the insurers, or regulating them to the point where they can't take a piss without getting the all clear. In their current form, you can't stop this. Healthcare shouldn't have a profit motive, because when it does your drugs cost more, your child birth costs like 1000% more, random tests cost 1000% more.


Let's make this clear, it's not ""state funded"" it's taxpayer funded. The state isn't paying for my healthcare, I'm paying into the system by working and paying taxes. 




&gt;No Im not. Ive looked at the figures across europe and it rings true in every country.




Any figures you look up on wait times shows that throughout Europe, wait times are either better than the US or essentially the same. There's nothing in what you're saying apart from outliers ‚Äî the outliers represent a problem, but they're not representative of the system.

&gt;No Im not. Youre conflating total beds with beds required. A country can have X beds per capita and require x+y beds while another can have x beds per capita and only require x-y. Total beds also doesnt account for the location of those beds. A rural hospital with more beds than patients means nothing when you see an urban hospital with people left sitting in the corridors because there arent any beds available. The NHS has had this happen a good few times in the last few years from what i hear. Not that I tend to watch the BBC channels so dont get too much of the news. Usually only when its so bad RTE news mentions it.




The vast majority of hospitals are in urbanised areas. You're acting as if hospitals are just built even spaced apart without taking into account population density. The only time I can ever remember a hospital being at capacity was due to covid, and that happened in other countries as well including the US.









&gt;It did see a consistent drop for many years as did places like Amsterdam which became the focal point of european recreational drug use. Portugal has seen a moderate rise in crime since 2015 though and Amsterdam has had its crime rate growing since before that. There is always a drop off where things are settling into the new normal and then it starts to tick up again once everyone finds the new baseline to work from. Thats the main contention I would have with your link about the areas where weed is legal. Most legalised it more recently and havent hit that baseline yet. While drug related crimes will fall it does seem that theft and violent crime in those areas do tend to increase and after a while overtake the overall decline due to declining drug crime rates. Also I would take things that outfits like norml say with a healthy heaping of salt being they are mage biased. 



Yeah Norml looked biased, the data is still there though.


Portugals rise was actually more immediate then went down and leveled off just above where it was before as opposed to not changing then rising years later.


I really haven't seen data which shows that crime increases, but if it were to increase by say 15%~ I think that's the price you pay for increased freedoms, and I'd prefer that. Obviously I support doing what Portugal did, but something I'd add to it is that the penalties for committing a crime under the influence be greatly increased. I feel that this could offset at least some of the crime increase if there were to be one.






&gt;When folk I know say crazy shit thats just wildly innappropriate or downright criminal I call them out. Id expect most folk to do the same. To not do it makes you tacitly complicit in it. I guarantee if they had been discussing how schools need more religion she would have been all over it but getting rid of political rivals after you take over doesnt seem to be an issue for her.

Well, it is true but based on the previous exchange, we can go on and on without reaching a resolution.

&gt;There isn't any voting on national self-determination. That's not a thing. You're trying to argue against some hypothetical based in an alternate universe.

Now, that's obviously not true.  There are many votes on issues of self-determination (or ones that pertain to national self-determination).  Europe was involved deeply in one of those (nominally Brexit).  I can imagine others.  In fact, the rescue packages in certain European countries after the Great Recession (Ireland, Portugal, Greece) required votes on issues of self-determination because in the exercise of these packages, these states surrendered substantial sovereignty to the ESM (which was actually set up as a state).  In these states, matters on that were referred to the equivalent constitutional courts and, in one case, Greece, there was a consultative referendum.  So, this is not a ""alternate universe"" it is real.  And how a right is enabled, depends on the specific enabling laws.  In summary, this is a right that members of the Jewish sect have and one that non-Jews do not have.  

Regarding the conscription of non-Jews: they are not conscripted because the state of Israel does not trust them.  That alone says volumes.

I think this is a very dangerous myth. Right now Sweden is doing fairly well, deaths are down to about 1 or 2 per day. Meanwhile a lot of countries in Europe are seeing more cases and a second wave. at the same time a lot of countries with forced lockdowns are having more deaths per capita.

I do extended 14 day water/salt only fasts once per quarter just to fine tune my physical and mental health.

Short fasts are harder than extended fasts because of the chemical reactions in your body. That hunger pang we feel frequently is generated naturally in your body... it produces a hormone called Ghrelin that notifies you that you ought to eat something. The amount of Ghrelin your body produces is dependent on your diet. If you‚Äôre a sugar and carbohydrates eater... you get lots of Ghrelin. If you are a fat burner... you don‚Äôt get nearly as much. That‚Äôs why ketoer‚Äôs are not ravishingly hungry when eating less calories than they used to. 

During a 48 hour fast... you‚Äôre going to get some slight hunger panes because of the Ghrelin. However... if you go over that 48 hour window with No, Zero, Zilch food, your body detects it‚Äôs not getting any new nutrition so it makes chemical changes to accommodate that fact... it quits producing any Ghrelin at all... and you enter the NO HUNGER ZONE... until you start eating food again.ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ 

That‚Äôs why whenever I do extended fasts I go 7, 10 or 14 days. There‚Äôs no Ghrelin and no hunger.

Instead of hunger that‚Äôs generated in your stomach by the hormone Ghrelin... while you‚Äôre on an extended fast it‚Äôs your long term memory that screws with you. Your brain reminds you everytime you would normally give it food... breakfast, lunch and dinner time. It‚Äôs not like your normal hunger pang... it just pops into your thought process... like a friendly reminder. That‚Äôs easy to deal with though compared to a regular hunger pang. 

Here‚Äôs the info on Ghrelin...

Ghrelin is a circulating hormone produced by enteroendocrine cells of the gastrointestinal tract, especially the stomach, and is often called a ""hunger hormone"" because it increases food intake. Blood levels of ghrelin are highest before meals when hungry, returning to lower levels after mealtimes. Ghrelin may help prepare for food intake by increasing gastric motility and gastric acid secretion. Ghrelin activates cells in the anterior pituitary gland and hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, including neuropeptide Y neurons that initiate appetite. Ghrelin stimulates brain structures having a specific receptor ‚Äì the growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1A. Ghrelin also participates in regulation of reward cognition, learning and memory, the sleep-wake cycle, taste sensation, reward behavior, and glucose metabolism.

Second Russian/Soviet reference‚Äîwhich I found interesting as Roddenberry meant the Klingons as the Soviets, with the Undiscovered Country as when the wall fell‚ÄîI also find the Soviet comparison to the Cardassians to be incoherent, and the US also worked with Nazi (see Operation Paperclip) &amp; Japanese scientists 

&gt;He also observed a similarity between the species, when viewed from such a three-dimensional perspective, and Soviets of the Cold War era. From the viewpoint of the United States, he remarked, ""At the height of the cold war with the Soviet Union, there were sympathetic scientists, people we could work with and talk to."" (Star

Third Soviet reference, except post fall:

&gt;For the same episode, Robert Wolfe used historical reference to base the Cardassians on, modeling them on the Soviets during the era after the fall of the Berlin Wall, when the communist Soviet Union could no longer maintain its rulership following the collapse of the KGB. Unlike with the Soviets, though, the DS9 writers intended for the change to the Cardassians ‚Äì ruled by a ""new civilian government"" ‚Äì to be only temporary. ""We always planned to go back,"" Wolfe emphasized. ""We always planned to make them go military again.""


On the Cardassians as Nazis and Bajorans as Jews‚Äîthe idea of the writers comparing the Dukat to both a Nazi &amp; Sitting Bull is pretty offensive to me, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs something they‚Äôd say if the show were written &amp; produced today: 

&gt;Cardassians as metaphors for the Nazis after World War II, being forced to work with Kira, who represented the Jews in the aftermath of the war. The Cardassians being referred to dismissively by Dukat was based on the American Indians being referred to dismissively by Sitting Bull. 

On the next Nazi comparison, albeit a strained one, as Germany was the second most powerful European military &amp; industrial power, Cardassians
&gt;‚Äùwere getting their asses kicked by everyone's forces"" and that that losing scenario motivated the Cardassians to collaborate with the Dominion, much as some Germans were historically persuaded to support Hitler because they perceived it as a method of escaping Germany's ruinous situation.

The comparison to underestimated forces‚Äîagain, I find this comparison by the writers morally odious, as it more accurately portrays the Bajorans, and the Cardassians were a major military power than fought a full war with the Federation previously: 

&gt;the Cardassians were similar to other opponents who were historically underestimated, such as the Viet Cong and the Native Americans tribes that fought at the Battle of the Little Bighorn

On the explicit fact that the Cardassians were multiple peoples, including Prussians pre Weimar, the Nazis, and the Soviets, &amp; again reinforcing Bajorans as Jews. I find the Soviet comparison incoherent, but the Nazi one coherent, to the extent that Nazi German, British, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Belgian, Italian, and Japanese colonial empires had many features in common:

&gt;Depending on the episode [...] the Cardassians could be Germans, or Russians or several other examples [....] These parallels do enter our discussions and sometimes are more overt than others [....] Blending the experiences of many Earth peoples and races into our storytelling allows us to comment on these subjects without advocating a particular political point of view, while at the same time allowing us to view the topics in a different light without the baggage of contemporary politics."" (AOL chat, 1997) Director Winrich Kolbe stated about the Cardassians, ""They're the Prussians of the universe, always 'kill, kill, kill.'"" (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion, p. 22) On the other hand, episodes such as DS9: ""Duet"" and ""Return to Grace"" used the Cardassians as metaphors for the Nazis (with the Bajorans representing Jews).

**Usually my process for figuring out how to analyze the show is first simply reflect on the show‚Äôs plot, style, symbolism, characters, etc, then simply figure out all the best analogies &amp; references the show makes in &amp; to physics, philosophy, biology, history, sociology, science fiction, literature, art, personal experience, etc. Then I create a theory that renders the show internally consistent, and one which renders the science, history, sociology etc, consistent &amp; correct as much as possible (including creating headcanon ‚Äòlaws‚Äô to explain where the shows physics are totally different). Having done this, I look at what the writers, producers, actors, and others said, reflected on, and intended, and mine from it What‚Äôs most useful &amp; relevant, and try to make my theories consistent with them as much as possible. Then I basically find the Venn diagram of my two or three theories (internally coherent, the real world science, scholarship, history, literature &amp; social science, and the meta-reflections of creators, actors, writers fans, etc), and where they overlap. Anything which sits at the center of the three I basically just consider ‚Äòtrue‚Äô whatever anyone else thinks (my comments on the Bajorans &amp; Dominion fall into this‚ÄîI independently came to the conclusion, its internally consistent to the show, its consistent, albeit it a hybridized manner, with actual reality &amp; history, and it reflects the creators intention).

A primeira etapa n√£o vai detalhar pontos considerados sens√≠veis: remunera√ß√£o de entrada dos servidores, faixas salariais para progress√£o de carreira, lista de fun√ß√µes que ser√£o extintas e defini√ß√£o dos cargos que perder√£o a estabilidade.

 Um dos respons√°veis pela formnula√ß√£o do texto disse √† **Folha**** **que, nesta quinta, ser√° enviada ao Legislativo uma PEC (Proposta de Emenda √† Constitui√ß√£o) que trar√° os comandos gerais da [reforma administrativa](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/reforma-administrativa/).

 A [maior parte dos projetos para regulamentar](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/09/reforma-administrativa-deve-alcancar-todos-os-poderes-diz-presidente-de-frente-no-congresso.shtml) pontos espec√≠ficos ser√° enviada ap√≥s a aprova√ß√£o da medida pelo Congresso. Demais textos que n√£o dependem de mudan√ßa na Constitui√ß√£o podem ser apresentados durante a tramita√ß√£o da PEC.

 A proposta, fechada nesta quarta-feira (2) pelo Pal√°cio do Planalto, define que as contrata√ß√µes no servi√ßo p√∫blico ter√£o tr√™s n√≠veis de estabilidade. Eles permanecer√£o em moldes semelhantes √†s regras atuais, com maior seguran√ßa no cargo, para carreiras t√≠picas de estado, como diplomatas, militares e auditores fiscais.

 A delimita√ß√£o da lista de carreiras, no entanto, deve ser fruto de regulamenta√ß√£o futura. Para o restante dos servidores concursados, haver√° um contrato de trabalho por tempo indeterminado, com estabilidade mais flex√≠vel.

  Ser√° menor a rigidez para o caso de o governo precisar, por exemplo, fazer desligamentos por conta de restri√ß√µes fiscais. Esses postos ter√£o fun√ß√£o mais abrangente, facilitando remanejamento de pessoal para √°reas com maior necessidade.

 No terceiro n√≠vel, [sem estabilidade](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/11/reforma-poe-fim-a-estabilidade-automatica-de-novos-servidores.shtml), trabalhadores poder√£o ser contratados com prazo determinado. A ideia √© usar esses servi√ßos para demandas pontuais e tempor√°rias.

 Cr√≠ticos da medida afirmam que o fim da estabilidade coloca em risco a atua√ß√£o dos servidores, que ficariam mais vulner√°veis a press√µes pol√≠ticas.

 Segundo t√©cnicos do Minist√©rio da Economia, a norma n√£o vai permitir demiss√µes baseadas em crit√©rios arbitr√°rios ou por prefer√™ncias pol√≠tico-partid√°rias.

 O governo tamb√©m pretende promover uma dr√°stica redu√ß√£o do n√∫mero de fun√ß√µes no servi√ßo p√∫blico. Atualmente, s√£o 117 carreiras que abrigam mais de 2.000 cargos diferentes.

 O governo federal trabalha para reduzir o n√∫mero de carreiras para algo entre 20 e 30. No entanto, a lista de postos extintos tamb√©m s√≥ ser√° conhecida em um segundo momento.

 Um dos formuladores da reforma afirma que a PEC n√£o cita carreiras espec√≠ficas. Isso ser√° tratado em normas infraconstitucionais enviadas posteriormente.

 Outro ponto que deve ser apresentado apenas no futuro √© o redesenho das tabelas salariais. O governo quer reduzir os sal√°rios de entrada e criar mais faixas para progress√£o ao longo da carreira. Esses detalhes ser√£o tratados em projeto de lei em outra fase da reforma.

 A proposta que ser√° apresentada nesta quinta-feira pode trazer as bases para as [novas regras de avalia√ß√£o de desempenho,](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/06/servico-publico-deveria-ser-avaliado-como-uber-diz-especialista.shtml) que ficar√£o mais r√≠gidas. As progress√µes autom√°ticas devem ser extintas.

  

  Nos planos da equipe econ√¥mica, esse seria um dos poucos pontos com validade para os atuais servidores. Diante da determina√ß√£o do presidente de que as regras tenham efeito apenas para novos contratados, o funcionalismo em atividade hoje pode ser poupado.

  O processo para efetiva√ß√£o no cargo ap√≥s um concurso e obten√ß√£o de estabilidade tamb√©m deve ficar mais rigoroso e pode durar um per√≠odo maior do que o existente hoje, de tr√™s anos.

 A primeira fase tamb√©m incluir√° proposta para acelerar a privatiza√ß√£o de estatais no pa√≠s. O texto, segundo assessores presidenciais, prev√™ que a venda passaria a ser autorizada caso o Executivo de cada ente federativo n√£o manifeste a inten√ß√£o de preservar a empresa.

 Com isso, a inten√ß√£o do governo √© inverter o processo de privatiza√ß√£o. Deixaria de ser demandado um aval legal para a venda, e passaria a haver uma necessidade legal para impedi-la.

 A proposta tamb√©m ir√° prever que cada unidade federativa defina sal√°rios, aumentos e b√¥nus a servidores p√∫blicos por meio de comit√™s regionais formados por representantes do poder p√∫blico e da sociedade civil.

 O objetivo √© tentar aproximar as remunera√ß√µes do servi√ßo p√∫blico √†s das empresas privadas, levando sempre em considera√ß√£o a situa√ß√£o fiscal do ente. As decis√µes s√≥ ser√£o adotadas quando foram un√¢nimes.

 Na formula√ß√£o final, o presidente deixou de fora o veto √† filia√ß√£o partid√°ria de futuros servidores p√∫blicos. O ponto, proposto pela equipe econ√¥mica, foi retirado ap√≥s forte rea√ß√£o contr√°ria de deputados e senadores.

 Membros do governo afirmam que a PEC pode ter tramita√ß√£o longa e que a implementa√ß√£o integral de todas as etapas da reforma pode demandar debates no Congresso at√© o fim do mandato de Bolsonaro, em 2022.

 Neste ano, o governo conseguiu aprovar no Legislativo medidas que travam sal√°rios de servidores at√© 2021 e limitam as possibilidades de concursos. Com isso, o Executivo ganha tempo para concretizar todas as fases da reforma, que enxuga a m√°quina p√∫blica e reduz gastos com pessoal.

 Ao fatiar a reforma administrativa, o governo deixa pontas soltas na proposta a ser encaminhada nesta quinta. Portanto, a equipe econ√¥mica ter√° que enfrentar novos debates no Congresso sobre pontos espec√≠ficos e pol√™micos da reestrutura√ß√£o do funcionalismo.

 A reforma come√ßou a ser gestada ainda no governo do ex-presidente [Michel Temer (MDB)](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2018/06/proposta-de-reforma-administrativa-vai-reavaliar-300-carreiras-na-uniao.shtml). Apesar de ter uma base de apoio no Congresso mais s√≥lida que Bolsonaro, Temer acabou desistindo de propor mudan√ßas estruturais, como um limite de R$ 5 mil para o sal√°rio inicial de servidores federais do Poder Executivo.

 O receio era gerar desgaste com o funcionalismo p√∫blico -- que tem um forte lobby no Congresso -- e com parlamentares ligados a corpora√ß√µes.

 Apesar de Bolsonaro (ap√≥s idas e vindas) indicar apoio √† reforma administrativa nesta semana, l√≠deres partid√°rios acreditam que a proposta inicial s√≥ deve ser analisada em 2021. Um dos motivos, segundo eles, √© a falta de empenho dos n√∫cleos pol√≠tico e militar do governo.

 A reestrutura√ß√£o do funcionalismo mexe com setores que s√£o base eleitoral do bolsonarismo, como a bancada da seguran√ßa p√∫blica. Al√©m disso, ministros militares integram a articula√ß√£o pol√≠tica do Pal√°cio do Planalto.

 Mesmo com o[ apoio do presidente da C√¢mara](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/08/maia-diz-que-vai-tentar-convencer-bolsonaro-a-enviar-reforma-administrativa.shtml), Rodrigo Maia (DEM-RJ), l√≠deres avaliam que a reforma ter√° dificuldades no Congresso neste ano. Por ser uma PEC, a proposta tem tramita√ß√£o longa e depende de apoio de 60% da C√¢mara e do Senado. Um projeto como esse depende de uma ampla negocia√ß√£o pol√≠tica com partidos.

 Outro fato citado nos bastidores do Legislativo √© que, com a proximidade das elei√ß√µes municipais, o assunto pode gerar desgaste, principalmente a deputados que tentam concorrer a prefeituras.

 Em agosto, o ent√£o secret√°rio Paulo Uebel, que cuidava da elabora√ß√£o da reforma administrativa,[ deixou o cargo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/08/dois-secretarios-de-guedes-pedem-demissao.shtml) alegando insatisfa√ß√£o com a demora para o envio da proposta. Depois disso, o governo correu para n√£o deixar a imagem da agenda de Guedes se desgastar.

 As novas regras para servidores est√£o sendo baseada em tr√™s grandes objetivos: modernizar do Estado, por meio de uma gest√£o com metas; aproximar o setor p√∫blico da realidade brasileira; e possibilitar um Estado financeiramente sustent√°vel.

 Apesar da situa√ß√£o das contas p√∫blicas, o pr√≥prio governo reconhece que os principais benef√≠cios nesse √∫ltimo quesito ficar√£o no longo prazo, porque a reforma n√£o afeta os atuais servidores.

 O gasto com pessoal representa a segunda maior despesa prim√°ria da Uni√£o, atr√°s apenas da Previd√™ncia. De acordo com o governo, apenas no √¢mbito federal, aproximadamente R$ 300 bilh√µes do Or√ßamento ficam comprometidos com pessoal.

 O governo diz que, considerando Uni√£o, estados e munic√≠pios, o pa√≠s destina 13,6% do seu PIB para pagamento da folha dos servidores p√∫blicos, percentual que estaria acima da m√©dia da Uni√£o Europeia (9,9%) ou dos Estados Unidos (9,5%).",True,False,False,,,,0,1599080613,,False,0,{},g3rpyv8,True,t3_ilfkkt,False,True,t3_ilfkkt,/r/brasilnoticias/comments/ilfkkt/sal√°rios_e_cargos_com_estabilidade_ficam_para/g3rpyv8/,False,,1611540550,1,True,False,brasilnoticias,t5_3a1qf,r/brasilnoticias,restricted,,0,[],

Again, not optimal when flying with a toddler. Meanwhile, Dubai is a gateway for flights from Europe to Asia and Oceania (I stopped there on my way from Europe to NZ as well). Direct flight from UK to Canada take between 8 and 13 hours, depending on the destination, as far as I can tell. And seeing as she's been travelling with a toddler, I'd imagine they'd want to take the fastest possible route (and not make a random stop halfway around the world).

[],,[deleted],,,,,,,dark,,,,,[],"If the United States were organized as an SFR, it would not be ""puppet state"", it would be part of the Soviet Union. The ""satellite states"" of Eastern Europe would be the likely model, these were not SSRs or SFRs or part of the Soviet Union but independent states with Communist regimes backed by the Soviet Union. Some of them could be surprisingly independent of the Soviet Union, for instance the early Romanian regime under Ceau»ôescu which refused requests to help put down the Czechoslovak spring, or the polish and Hungarian regimes which implemented market elements into their governments and were notably moderate. However of course if you went too far out of line the Soviet Union would inevitably invade them and put hardliners in place, as they did in Easy Germany in 1953, Hungary in 1956, and Czechoslovakia in 1968.

The Soviet SSRs and SFR were an entirely different deal. The Soviet Union was organized as a federation of ""Republics"". To make things more confusing the Russian SFR was itself a full fledged federation because it was so large, and it itself had ""Republics"" underneath it which had the highest degree of autonomy in the SFR system (usually representing minorities). The modern Russian state actually still had ""Republics"" as one of its subnational divisions. 

It was all technically still one state. Although somewhat bizarrely they managed to get a concession allowing them to send Ukrainian and Belarusian delegates to the United Nations as if they were separate states (the United States maintained its own right to send delegates from two American states at the end of negotiations, theoretically it still retains that right, however due to disputes over precisely which states would get the seats this was never implemented, and in practice its obsolete with the dissolution of the Soviet Union anyway). 

If the United States were absorbed directly into the Soviet Union after a loss in a war it would be strange, the Soviet Union was basically a massive amalgation of most old Russian imperial territory (main exceptions being Finland and Poland). The United States was never part of the old Russian imperial core of course so they'd have no such claim. Likely they would pursue the model of Eastern Europe, hey look we've liberated the poor Americans and set up a workers state to liberate the oppressed American workers. Then they'd funnel hordes of rubles to it to prop up the government from the constant instability it would be threatened with, and also install a giant embassy in Washington DC which operated suspiciously more like an administrative building than a facility for state to state communication and diplomacy. Think of the ginormous American embassy in Iraq which is like the largest embassy in the world and the only one placed in the middle of the green zone with the actual Iraqi government buildings. You need something like that when managing an occupation, and this would be the lord of all occupations.

Even further down the spectrum, the Soviet Union might ignore the actual nature of the American central gov, knowing it would be too difficult to occupy, and just extract a treaty requiring massive reductions in the American sphere of influence, kicking them out of Europe and opening the door to them in Latin America. And America would be subject to Finlandization or something with a pansy central government appeasing the Soviets trying to keep the peace. I mean if you think about it that's about what the Americans did to Russia under the Yeltsin admin after the SU fell. It fell apart badly eventually of course but I would doubt the converse would last either.
