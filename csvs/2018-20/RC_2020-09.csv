It depends on what you like. It can be good or bad. 

&gt;And if I were to move there from the US, how could I be as respectful as possible?

By learning Italian and speaking Italian. But how do you plan to move from the US? Do you have an EU Passport? It's almost impossible to live/work in Italy without EU citizenship. 

Nobody even knows when Americans will be allowed to VISIT Italy again. It depends on when (or if ever) the US gets control of the coronavirus, and it does not look like that will happen any time soon especially with the current administration. 

&gt;What's housing like

Crowded in the cities.

&gt;what does it look like to get a job? 

Difficult even for locals. 

&gt;What's the cost of living compared to minimum wage?

There isn't a ""mininum"" wage in Italy.

&gt;How's the climate 

It varies a lot from North to South.

&gt;how are the people?

Good people, but political correctness is not common like in the US. More backward in the sense that gender roles are very traditional here; a lot of women have never had a job. Still, I think Italians are more relaxed than Americans, and usually enjoy life more.

You haven‚Äôt beaten any of my arguments.
You literally said that they are stakes because the villain will take over the world. So that means that Ronan from guardians of the galaxy is the best villain cause he could destroy an entire planet very easily and that means the villain in Thor the dark work is one of the best too cause he almost took over the world.

Your way of reviewing a movie you honestly sound like a 7 year old who hasn‚Äôt seen many movies. ‚ÄúWow rhinos good cgi‚Äù ‚Äúwow he wants to take over the world‚Äù really bro I‚Äôm pretty sure that you haven‚Äôt even seen movies like The Godfather or taxi driver. Just superhero flicks and bad cgi movies. The cgi in black panther is objectively terrible, if you like the rest of the movie that‚Äôs fine but if you really can‚Äôt see the flaws in the cgi then you‚Äôre blind or you have never seen a movie with gold effects.
I want you to watch James Cameron‚Äôs Avatar or even Jurassic Park. Those have better CGI than black panther. And they came out even before black panther. Iron Man 1 has good cgi even better than black panther.
If you really can‚Äôt see that the special effects in black panther are bad then you‚Äôre a shill from this movie and you like this movie cause it has black oriole, simple as that ‚Äúoh diversity is the best thing cause if I say it‚Äôs bad I might be a racist‚ÄùüòÇüòÇ nah bro worst effects in any marvel movie right next to the Incredible Hulk. 

Killmonger is not intimidating. Like I said before I review films from an adult and intelectual perspective, I‚Äôm the type of guy that agreees with Martin Scorsese that marvel isn‚Äôt real cinema. Killmonger is not intimidating, yes his motivations make sense, I never said that Killmonger is a bad villain but he is just overrated. The biggest problem with killmonger is he doesn‚Äôt feel like an actual character he is just an obstacle for black panther, remember when I said that the plot of this movie is a mess? The first half of this movie is completely different from the second half, Killmongers plan is stupid, why did he wait so long to kill Klaus? Why did we as the audience have to war one hour of chasing a villain that has zero importance to the story besides dying? 
That is because Killmonger sadly isn‚Äôt developed enough to be seen as an actual character for me, he has so little screen time. Compare Killmonger to Joker from the dark knight or Thanos, or even Voldemort, or Bane. All this villain actually feel like real characters and not just obstacles. Just because one is powerful doesn‚Äôt make them good. Killmonger is an obstacle not a character, they tried to make him a character but the script is a mess. 
Secondly do you know why Killmonger is not intimidating? The acting. Michael B Jordan is a good actor but his performance was very weak. First of all Killmonger is a very aggressive character, but Michael B Jordan plays him like his very calm his basically underacting him. If you don‚Äôt know what underacting is it‚Äôs basically when an actor plays a character that‚Äôs very dull and calm but then snaps at any second while still maintaining some level of calmness. For example Gus Fring from Breaking Bad. The actor is underacting the character because it fits with how the script and story want him to be. But Killmonger doesn‚Äôt fit, his always aggressive his accent and tone don‚Äôt fit with Gus Fring at all. This movie can be badly directed at times since the actors don‚Äôt fit the acting with the scene, like when Black Panther arrives from the dead and Killmonger says ‚Äúwassup‚Äù that like is incredibly cringy and stupid, it doesn‚Äôt fit with the character of Killmonger at all. Imagine if Thanos said ‚Äúwassup‚Äù it doesn‚Äôt fit right? Same thing goes with Killmonger. 

They are no stakes because the characters are stupid. So basically black panther agrees to fight Killmonger even if he knows that Killmonger is a psychopath that saved Klaw? When Andy Serkis escape with Killmonger the camera focuses on the necklace and black panther sees it, he knows that Killmonger helped Klaw escaped, so why the fuck is he willing to give up the thrown for a fraudüòÇüòÇ it just feels so forced and it‚Äôs obvious what the writers are trying to do but it‚Äôs so badly written and so predictable it ruins the experience. 

They where no stakes when Killmonger won, zero. You honestly though he was going to win? Bro it‚Äôs a marvel movie for kidsüòÇ and even if he did win the avengers could‚Äôve easily stopped it. Don‚Äôt you think that Thor can‚Äôt battle Wakanda? Thor literally saved Wakanda in avengers infinity war. Or Scarlet Witch or Hulk or Vision or even Iron Man since he is one of the smartest people in the world of the MCU just imagine what he would do with Wakanda technology he would definitely do better than Shuri. 
Oh and now on the subject of vibranium, it has literally become a plot device for vibranium to do whatever you want it to do, wether it‚Äôs heal people from getting shot in the back or even bringing them back from the death. That‚Äôs another reason as to why they are no stakes.

When black panther gets defeated and ‚Äúdies‚Äù and then he comes back the big problem is that he comes back too soon. They should‚Äôve shown his journey and how Killmonger would rule, they should‚Äôve shown more of the ‚ÄúWakanda civil war‚Äù and disagreements between their people, why do people agree with Killmonger just because he wants to take over the world? Is there something deeper. This movie is not deep at all it‚Äôs just very blandly written and so underwhelming cause it could‚Äôve had potential but just another mediocre marvel movie that took itself too seriously. 


Wakanda is one of the stupidest places in the mcu by how dumb it is. Let me give you an example: Imagine if in Thor Ragnarok or Aquaman they included a great, bustling, technologically advanced Hyperborea that was populated exclusively by tall, blonde white people. Where they exclusively practiced ancient Norse/Germanic culture and spoke Proto Indo European, and the head of the kingdom was some kind of Aryan Super Human wielding an axe and shield, riding around in a chariot....
That movie wouldn‚Äôt even find funding. But even if it did the law suits and outrage would prevent it from ever being filmed.  

That concept is exactly what Black Panther is, but because the movie is about a socially accepted race and culture, it was nominated for best picture. That‚Äôs it.

&gt;possible for the United States to rein China back in peacefully or to break it's back in 2020. Are you hoping for a world war? I'm listening if you're willing to try to convince me otherwise.

I'm not hoping for war, I'm saying things could go either way, and avoiding unpleasantries only defers conflict. I'm saying that conflicts should be taken taken head on and situations should be resolved post haste instead of letting them simmer. Like you said, the world waited 40 years, and still no recognition for Taiwan. I say  let's stop patronizing CCP sentiments, recognise Taiwan officially throughout the world, and if CCP takes that excuse to stay a conflict, let's take that head on too.



&gt;difficult proposition but far more likely than the United States coming to save the day

US govt will not poll citizens of China attacks Taiwan. I don't think EU will sit out either.

What is worse than China attacking right now, in my opinion, is China normalising it's aggressive behaviour for, say, a decade and *then* attacking. That will be like Pakistan normalising supporting terrorism in Afghanistan and India for decades, to the extent that their ex-ISI chief can go to Oxford University and openly declare that terrorists in India were ""their men"", so when something like Kargil War happens the international community doesn't bat an eye.

1.) the US would sue for peace rather than attempt a risky and likely costly attack against the newly expanded and strengthened Japanese Empire

2.) the US would recover from Pearl Harbor and attempt offensive operations against Japan. The Americans would then sustain enormous losses that they were unwilling to bear- probably in part through a single decisive fleet battle dominated by battleships- after which they would sue for peace. 

Neither of those things happened, of course. US leaders never for a moment considered negotiations after Pearl Harbor and instead used a combination of industrial power and plain old guts to grind their empire down and ultimately force Japan to capitulate. 

There really is no scenario where Japan grabs it‚Äôs 1942 empire without fighting the US. This was primarily due to the large US presence in the Philippines, and also because many of the territories that Japan wanted were already European colonies, so attacking them would mean attacking US allies.

When I said [other people] could make their own Star Wars stories, we decided that, like Star Trek, we would have two universes: My universe and then this other one.

&gt;‚ÄúFor me and my training here at Lucasfilm, working with George, he and I always thought the Expanded Universe was just that. It was an expanded universe. Basically it‚Äôs stories that are really fun and really exciting, but they‚Äôre a view on Star Wars, not necessarily canon to him.That was the way it was from the day I walked into Lucasfilm with him all through Clone Wars, everything we worked on, he felt the Clone Wars series and his movies were what was actually the reality of it all, the canon, then there was everything else. So it wasn‚Äôt a big dynamic shift for me mentally when there was this big announcement saying the EU is now Legends.

[],,JonstheSquire,1354064651.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_9qcmz,False,False,[],"&gt;Belgium, Croatia, Portugal, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden, Colombia - there's countless examples of countries that have directly benefited from selling their talent to top-five leagues.

Relative to prior generations, none of these countries have benefited in a top-five dominant world relative to their competition.

Denmark won the Euros in 1992 and finished third in 1984.  They have been nowhere near that level in in the post-2000 big five dominant world.

Sweden's golden eras were in the 1950s and and early 1990s.  They have not come close to that level since.

Switzerland have never made it pass the round of 16 in any tournament so 1954, so I am not sure how they are success story.

Colombia is the only team who has been good relative to prior eras post 2000, when they they won and finished fourth in the Copa America in 2001 and 2004.  However, their 2001 Copa America team featured 17 players from the Colombian league and only 1 playing in Europe.  Their 2018 World Cup team that got eliminated in the round of 16 had three players from Colombia.

Again, my point is not that these countries would have been better off by forcing their players to stay.  My point is that the current centralization of talent and financial power in five countries, has benefited those countries more than anyone else.

&gt;Selling clubs don't make their money from fans, they make their money from transfers, which in turn funds the league and incentives the continued production of talent. In the last 20 years, Benfica has had an income of *1.27 billion USD* from outbound transfers, Porto has 1.24b. Ajax? 845m. PSV, 490m. Shaktar Donetsk, 446m, Boca Juniors, 431m.

Everyone of these clubs produced and developed talent prior to the current dominance of five leagues.  They would still be producing talent absent such a development.

If MLS only ever is a development league built on feeding talent to European leagues, it is never going to gain much popularity in this country, which will make it very difficult for soccer generally break through an become part of the American culture.",True,False,False,,,,0,1598924853,,1598925327,0,{},g3jis6x,False,t3_ijyv3s,False,True,t1_g3jhd8a,/r/ussoccer/comments/ijyv3s/if_mls_becomes_a_selling_league_and_stays_that/g3jis6x/,False,,1611392799,0,True,False,ussoccer,t5_2sk2p,r/ussoccer,public,,0,[]

Afterpay is obviously the big player and has the most market reach and is entering the largest number of markets

PayPal does have a huge customer base and can pivot into BNPL with the right plays. It all will depend on ease of use ect..... They have a lot of potential but can also flop. I have seen a BNPL option on PayPal before and didn't look as appealing as the others

The next players is where it comes interesting. There isn't room for SZL SPT and Z1P plus more, Z1P is also clearly the biggest out of the ""others"". Acquisitions will most likely happen and big guys will buy out little ones especially with the demand to invest here and how quickly capital can be raised.

This is all about consumer usage not profitability

But in my opinion we are looking at a Uber/Lyft/Didi kinda situation where everyone competes but unlike this situation I think once a consumer for example chooses afterpay they aren't moving. No customer will move permanently to a smaller BNPL but they may get it as a 2nd option if they can access particular shops that another cannot. However you will see consumer jump from smaller BNPL to a bigger one like APT. So its realistically a 1 way stream (unless they gain some crazy features but bigger players can implement things faster too with bigger development teams)

Most companies are focusing US/UK/AUS but what about the Asian markets? APT is pushing them now too while also coming after the rest of Europe.

They should almost say fk it let them get organic growth in the US/UK/AUS and then push Asian markets harder because they will have no competition there. Its a long way away till z1p szl or spt will enter other markets as they r just coming into US and UK too.

A huge transit system in America would be amazing and save so much traffic on the roads and highways in America and pollution as well. Even when I look at the existing ones like of huge cities like LA I‚Äôm surprised by how sparse it is in comparison to London. In London there‚Äôs a train station like every few roads or 5 minutes walking time. And when you look at the national rail system of America map it literally looks like an uninhabited desert or Siberia with lack of routes and stations. Shocking for the world‚Äôs richest country!

And whatta ya know, Germany putting communists in camps. What do you think he does? I think that Trotsky would plow through Eastern Europe and Scandinavia and invade Germany.

Now think about how this looks to the West. This is before the Holocaust or before Germany could invade anyone. Anti-communist tensions are already very high. All they see is the aggressive Soviet Union trying to take over Europe. Not only that, but this was just the thing Hitler was waiting for. This entire time he was going on about how ‚Äúthe bolshevik jews are trying to destroy Germany‚Äù when suddenly a bolshevik jew tries to destroy Germany. This would look really good for him. Just like how in our timeline capitalism and communism united against fascism, in this alternate timeline democracy and fascism unite against communism.

In this alternate World War II there are of course two sides: The Socialist Powers and the Allied Powers. The Socialist Powers are the Soviet Union, Spain, Mongolia, and Tuva. The Allied Powers are basically the rest of the world, but the big five that you need to worry about are the United States, Britain, France, Germany, and Japan.

Now I know what you‚Äôre thinking: since the Japanese and the Americans are on the same side, and therefore there is no attack on Pearl Harbor, why do the Americans get involved? Keep in mind that the United States, while it was at this time mostly isolationist, was much more willing to get involved in European affairs when it came to stopping the spread of communism. Remember that the United States aided the White Army during the Russian Civil War. So I think that if the Soviet Union invaded the West, the United States would get involved right away.

So how does this war play out? The sheer numbers and brutal tactics of the Red Army along with the harsh geography of the Soviet Union would make this a longer, more drawn-out war than in our timeline. Spain would probably be the first to fall since it‚Äôs surrounded by France and Portugal and cut off from the rest of the Socialist Powers, meanwhile Tuva and Mongolia, while much less powerful, hug right up against the Soviet Union and therefore would be harder to take. Spain wouldn‚Äôt fall right away though. The Soviets would probably send a large amount of support to the Spanish front so it would take a while to wear them down. Spain falls in 1941 when French, Portugese, and American forces take Madrid.

Meanwhile the fighting in Central Europe and Asia is much more dragged out. In Asia, Japan and China are pushing back against the communists in Mongolia and Siberia. In Central Europe, no side is able to push back the other until the United States and Germany develop atomic bombs.

In 1945 Roosevelt and Hitler meet in DC to discuss when and where to drop the first atomic bomb. Hitler wants to drop one right in the middle of Moscow, but Roosevelt and the rest of the delegates agree that that‚Äôs too drastic. They decide to drop an atomic bomb on Tsaritsyn as a warning. The Allies give Trotsky an ultimatum to unconditionally surrender or else they‚Äôll nuke another city. Trotsky refuses. Odessa is nuked. Trotsky, ever-stubborn, still refuses to surrender. The allies as a last resort threaten to nuke Kiev, Leningrad, and Moscow. Trotsky still wants to keep fighting, but at this point the Party is sick of his shit so they throw him out of office and have him imprisoned. The interim Premier agrees to unconditional surrender.

After the war the allies go through the process of dividing up Europe. The Soviet Union is split into independent former Soviet Socialist Republics. Russia is split into four independent states. Everything west of the Ural mountains is split into a North Russia and a South Russia, plus an independent Karelia. Everything east of the Ural mountains becomes an independent Siberia. Spain is split into a North Spain and a South Spain, plus an independent Catalonia and Basque Country. Japan annexes a bit of Siberia and Mongolia, and the US annexes a small chunk of Eastern Siberia since it‚Äôs right next to Alaska. France takes Spain‚Äôs colonies. Germany takes a portion of Poland and Czechoslovakia since they were destroyed by the Red Army anyway and the allies figured Germany had earned it.

The allies set up new governments in the former Socialist Powers and the states that they invaded. Southern Eastern Europe and Asia are under American influence, while Northern Eastern Europe and Central Europe are under German influence. What follows is a Cold War between democracy and fascism.

Much like how in our timeline World War II delegitimized fascism, in this alternate timeline socialism is delegitimized. Left-wing policies are much more unpopular, whereas more nationalist policies become more popular.

[],,TheBluntReport,,,,[],,,,text,t2_4928rncv,False,False,[],"Jack Johnson was the son of ex-slaves and the third of 9 children. His debut came at the age of 20 where he fought ‚Äì and knocked out ‚Äì Charley Brooks, winning him a purse of just $1.50. As Johnson made more of a name for himself, he was unable to challenge for the heavyweight crown as the current title holder Jim Jeffries refused to fight him; something that was common within the boxing world in that era.

As time went on, and due to Johnson‚Äôs obvious skill as well as his bravado and popularity, a chance at the heavyweight title was on the horizon. Johnson made a point to follow the new heavyweight champion Tommy Burns around the globe, taunting him in front of the press for a duration of 2 years, until he finally provoked a match. This title fight occurred in 1908 in Sydney, Australia and the fight was only agreed on by Burns as he was guaranteed a large purse of $30,000. The police stepped in at the 14th round and stopped the fight, with Johnson being declared the winner.

This moment flared up racial animosity, with a portion of whites calling for a ‚ÄúGreat White Hope‚Äù to take the title from Johnson. The New York Times itself even wrote ""If the black man wins, thousands and thousands of his ignorant brothers will misinterpret his victory as justifying claims to much more than mere physical equality with their white neighbors‚Äù. Famously during this racial animosity, Winston Churchill banned a scheduled fight in England, as well as the entrance of Johnson. Whether due to public pressure, or the possibility of a black man beating an English soldier in the heart of the British Empire, Churchill declared that Johnson‚Äôs fight was ‚Äúnot in the best interests of the nation‚Äù. This clearly had a large effect on Johnson, who previously thought of England as the bastion of civilisation, but later stated that the British were hypocrites and no better than Americans.

In 1910, Johnson finally got his chance to fight Jim Jeffries in what was dubbed ‚Äúthe fight of the century‚Äù. This was a humbling moment for Jeffries who, after the loss, declared ‚ÄúI could never have whipped Johnson at my best‚Äù.

Johnson also faced persecution in his life outside of boxing. Notably, he was arrested in 1912 for violating the Mann Act ‚Äì jurisdiction that forbade ‚Äútransporting women across state lines for immoral purposes‚Äù ‚Äì after travelling with his white girlfriend Lucille Cameron. Though this case fell apart, Johnson was later arrested for similar reasons due to his relationship with Belle Schreiber, a relationship that occurred before the Mann Act even existed. In front of an all-white jury, with Kenesaw Landis presiding over the case (the man who fought for disallowing black baseball players, known as the baseball color line), Schreiber testified against Johnson and he was sentenced to prison. Johnson skipped bail and fled with his wife to France. For seven years, they lived in exile across Europe, South America and Mexico, until finally he surrendered himself at the Mexican border.¬†",True,False,False,,,,0,1598939875,,False,0,{},g3k610a,True,t3_ikew4r,False,True,t3_ikew4r,/r/ADifferentEra/comments/ikew4r/this_is_jack_johnson_with_his_wife_etta_terry/g3k610a/,False,,1611404526,3,True,False,ADifferentEra,t5_2xbip,r/ADifferentEra,public,,0,[]

But regardless, NZ history is still caucasian focused. Yes, we learn the treaty of Waitangi, but in literature, we still focus on Shakespeare and in history pre-1700, that of Europe. All of our history classes are in English. I am not saying this is bad a thing, it would be silly to learn Shakespeare in Maori.

Similarly in Inner Mongolia, the only policy change is to teach Literature etc in Mandarin. Maths/Science are still taught in Mongolian. NZ does not go this far at all - I don't know of s single school that conducts physics/maths class in the Maori language.

So my point is before we throw stones at what they're doing in China, we should recognise that it is hardly that extreme. Mongolian culture is as well supported there is Maori is in NZ.

I should note that NZ is also the most progress out of all the colonial countries.

East India Company is also just a trading company but their ships are heavily armed for their time. Besides, we know that the said company recruits from ex-military (just like PMCs of the 21st century) and has access to helicopter gunships that are clearly armed with lethal weapons and mechs designed for combat. That means that at the very least it is a well-trained and funded mercenary group. For comparison, modern day PMCs (like the Russian Wagner Group) have access to T-72 tanks, heavy artillery and helicopter gunships.

&gt;Yeah, thats why they were losing until the planetary intelligence that nobody was really sure existed or cared called in a zerg rush.

These animals are nowhere near as tough as armored vehicles. Considering the fact that the US army in the 1990s has no problem destroying numerically superior Iraqi armored units in the battle of 73 easting (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_73_Easting), I'd say the local wildlife is toast.

&gt;Because they weren't a military with military objectives. They were a mining company with a very limited charter and strict prohibition from engaging in hostilities with the native population.

They are, as I have established above, a well-trained and funded mercenary group commanded by former officers. The security forces is also defiant of other human staff from the same company (like the scientist). This means that there is a clear chain of command and the security forces are treating it as a military operation. 

Additionally, it is shown in the movie that they have access to napalm bombs. I don't think those are designed for mining. Thus, it can be deduced that the mercenaries have access to military grade weapons, which can be used in their operation but they somehow just refuse to use them.

&gt;It was a dozen or two vehicles equivalent to hummers vs hundreds of angry 20+ ton rhino type creatures, and a dozen or two blackhawks vs hundreds of literal dragons, that attacked out of nowhere and gave the humans all of seconds to respond to the threat.

Numerical superiority does not translate to actual strength. Animals can zerg rush the humans, but where is the indirect fire support for the humans? The thing is, if there are hundreds of 20+ ton rhinos running in a dense forest, the movement can easily be spotted and tracked. Long range weapons can be used to deal with them. Also, the humans in the movie clearly had access to unmanned bulldozers, they could have used these heavy vehicles as scouts in front of the main force. Finally, the range of claws and horns is significantly shorter than that of autocannons and rockets. The animals will suffer from heavy casualties before they even reach the human lines. Dead bodies will start to pile up in front of the human gunline, making additional charges significantly more difficult. Finally, humans have actually used animal charges in warfare. Incendiary pigs (pigs doused with combustible pitch, crude oil or resin) were used to break the siege of Megara in 266 BC.

Oh BTW, not a big problem but those helicopters are definitely better armed than pure transports like the blackhawk.

&gt;The movie wasn't Humans vs Navi. It was a small deliberately undergunned mining company vs the Navi.

European colonists are not fully militarized as there are women and children in their ranks. They can still defeat most local tribes in North America.

In 1918, Stalin created the ""[Jewish Section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yevsektsiya)"" (Evsection) of the People's Commissariat for Nationalities. The structure dealt with the problems of settling the Jewish people in the USSR. One of her most important projects was the organization of Jewish agricultural communes. The Bolsheviks managed to get money from Jewish organizations in the United States and Western Europe. For example, the ""Agro Joint"" (James Rosenberg) propagated that ""in the countryside, the urban Jew will lose his nervousness and impatience.""

In 1924, the Bolsheviks created the ""[Komzet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komzet)"". It was planned that even before the end of 1926, approximately 500 thousand Jews would receive 100 thousand hectares of land for cultivation in the Ukrainian SSR and the Crimean ASSR of the RSFSR.

In 1927, the first Jewish national region in the USSR was created in the Kherson region of Ukraine. In 1929, the Novozlatopol Jewish national district arose in the Zaporozhye region, in 1930 - the Stalindorf one in the Dnepropetrovsk region and the Freidorf one in the Crimea. 

The [American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Jewish_Joint_Distribution_Committee) has conducted fundraising throughout the United States in support of Jewish autonomy. For six years (1928-34), the organization donated $ 250 million to the foundation of the Jewish Autonomous Region. In addition, she donated a large amount of agricultural equipment and seeds to future colonists.

In 1930, the Birobidzhan National Region was formed, and on May 7, 1934, the [Jewish Autonomous Region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Autonomous_Oblast) was formed as part of the [Far Eastern Territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_East). Every second Jew returned back in less than a year. Terrible climate, lack of infrastructure and big cities. 

Jewish autonomous regions in the European part of the USSR existed until the Second World War. All Party initiatives were destroyed by Stalin.

There is a lot of information about how Stalin's own entourage was repressed. His daughter from his first marriage ([Svetlana Alliluyeva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svetlana_Alliluyeva)) was in love with a Jew [Aleksei Kapler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksei_Kapler), he was exiled to the GULAG. [Molotov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vyacheslav_Molotov)'s wife [Polina Zhemchuzhina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polina_Zhemchuzhina) was sent to Kazakhstan. Stalin personally read the ""revelation"". He read it on public (and Molotov himself) about how she had group sex with her former assistants. The reason was her friendship with [Mikhoels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Mikhoels) and [Fefer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itzik_Feffer) (actors), her visit to a Moscow synagogue in March 1945, and the fact that after the establishment of diplomatic relations between the USSR and Israel, she approached Ambassador [Golda Meir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golda_Meir) at a reception and spoke to her in Yiddish.",True,False,False,,,,0,1598948258,,False,0,{},g3kefwl,False,t3_ik1gmv,False,True,t1_g3iztdk,/r/PropagandaPosters/comments/ik1gmv/a_delusional_mirageussr_1970/g3kefwl/,False,,1611408978,2,True,False,PropagandaPosters,t5_2rm3n,r/PropagandaPosters,public,,0,[]

Only one in 10 energy suppliers globally has prioritised renewables over fossil fuels, the study finds.

Even those that are spending on greener energy are continuing to invest in carbon heavy coal and natural gas.

The lead researcher says the slow uptake undermines global efforts to tackle climate change.

In countries like the UK and across Europe, renewable energy has taken a significant share of the market, with 40% of Britain's electricity coming from wind and solar last year

But while green energy has boomed around the world in recent years, many of the new wind and solar power installations have been built by independent producers.

Large scale utility companies, including many state and city owned enterprises, have been much slower to go green, according to this new study.

The research looked at more than 3,000 electricity companies worldwide and used machine learning techniques to analyse their activities over the past two decades.

The study found that only 10% of the companies had expanded their renewable-based power generation more quickly than their gas or coal fired capacity.

Most players at the beginning will just run through the Main quest line because it gives you decent gear to start out. You can do the main quest until Valencia 1 for that or do the Kamasilvia/Drieghan Mainquest aswell for some extra gear. If you dont know what im talking about: press o and you will see all your quests, where there is a main quest tab aswell. Once you finished the main quest till Valencia, you can either start really learning the game as you can start grinding more different monster zones now especially for skill points, or you can do side quests to reach Lvl 61 ( search for a tutorial on youtube) 
For your question regarding skills: not all skills are useful, most classes have 2-3 damage skills, some buffs, some skills needed for either PvE or PvP and then some movement skills, its best to hit up a skill guide for your class to see what you need/want.
You can always reset your skills if you are under Lvl 57 or you have a ""secret book of old moon"" running(available through pearl shop or events) there is also another item that you can get that lets you reset your skills, most classes get it after doing their awakening/succession questline, but as archer is different in that regard, i cant tell you when you will get that questline.

Yes, there are lots of quests besides the main quest that you use for different stuff (side quests that give you small amounts of combat exp, daily quests for useful items, questlines with storycontent for different regions, Quests for inventory slots) Scroll a bit through your  quest tab to see more about that.
Also, many people have set their goal to reach 30000 quests, as that gives some really good items(failstacks that are quite useful for enhancing gear)

I would recommend you to play on the season servers as there you will get good starting gear easier and will also receive more info about the game. The season server will start on the 2nd septembre but you can precreate a character for extra loot. Also consider precreating a hashashin(the new class) for extra loot. 

As you can see: the game has a lot to offer and it will be a long run, so stay patient and try to have fun. As for some useful tips i can give you: patch notes and youtube are your best friend, try to use guides to find out how to do stuff and inform yourself about events giving you good loot. If you dont want to be alone, recommend the game to your friends, starting on the same day as season servers, there will be a promotion on twitch where everyone who linked their BDO account with twitch can watch BDO partnered streamers for 5 hours will get the game for free. More info on https://www.blackdesertonline.com/twitch?lang=EN

Other useful info i have for you: in every big city in BDO there is an NPC named Ellie near the stable keeper. She sells you useful items such as buff food, strong starting gear or a compass to help navigate through the desert for only 1 silver each so try finding her

If you have any other questions, feel free to hit me or others on reddit up.

Hope you have fun playing BDO

Edit: forgot to mention: most of the info i gave you is only  important for you if you play on the EU or NA region as some regions will get new content a little bit later than others.",True,False,False,,,,0,1598950522,,1598951246,0,{},g3kggws,False,t3_ikg174,False,False,t3_ikg174,/r/blackdesertonline/comments/ikg174/just_installed_bdo/g3kggws/,False,,1611410034,22,True,False,blackdesertonline,t5_2w6ir,r/blackdesertonline,public,,0,[]

(As far as I understand but it's kind of legal mumbo  jumbo for me.   
What is here to note is that the patent runs out after some time and everyone has access to it, so at first it is established to get some of the investment for development back.   
What also people fail to mention that lots of drugs are developed at univeritys that are founded by the government and companies buy some research off of them to later profit. (yes they have more investing to do after that but it's much cheaper because it shortens their research by quite a few years).

In a few years I predict we'll see a switch in leadership who produces the most APIs because the US are not founding research as much anymore while China is steadily increasing their budget. 

If what the previous comment said was true about European countries not paying enough for reaserach then there would be no more research going on in Europe because the companies wouldn't have the founds.

Patriotism like many others said is not a ""Bad"" word.

Jinogism is like the ""bad"" version of it.

Nationalism to me is more of a political word while the other two are like behavioral descriptors.

Before I give examples I'll just say that racism does come out when people of a mono-ethnic or homogeneous country fear that they're losing their identity or whatever. Japan, China and Canada are like this. This is sold as ""nationalism"" by the gov't but can turn into racism if they're deliberately hampering  immigration from other ethnicities/races with different customs. So yes, there's is overlap but it's not automatic.

\*\*\*Examples\*\*\*

Patriotism: Waving the American flag on July 4th

Jingoism: Proud Boys behavior

Nationalism: Xi Jing Ping or Narendra Modi Behavior(changed this from North Korea)

Ultra-nationalism: Russia/Putin's policies and behavior(usually coincides with dictatorships and authoritarianism. Those two do NOT have to be present for Patriotism)

Racism: KKK

Prejudice: Trump Muslim Ban

Not to mention that NASA has more concerns than SpaceX does: they actively operate space probes all over the solar system, are responsible for astronaut training, have a lot more scientific work to do beyond just launching rockets, and they maintain public outreach and education programmes. Although developments in rocket launch systems are important, getting a rocket off the ground is only the first part of a very long and important mission to learn about the universe.

It also doesn't address other areas of research. There are no privatized institutions for high energy particle physics. Computer science (my field) has stagnated almost to a halt under the domination of the private sector and it's only because of the work of a few people like me who truly love computers and don't work for big companies that anything really important in the area gets done. I'm working on papers and processor architectures that could have been developed 30 or 40 years ago but because almost all of the computer industry is privatized and focused on consumer products it's been the same for decades.

What about my brother's research on quantum-level simulations of lasers interacting with metal plasmas? The computers he uses for that are hugely expensive and there are few to no commercial applications for it yet. What about CERN? What about intensely hypothetical stuff that lives in the far future and that's so massive in scale no private company could feasibly do it like Dyson swarms?

And on a more fundamental level, where will scientists publish their work if not for respected, accredited scientific journals, which are largely funded by universities, which are in turn largely funded by governments? And before even that, who will pay for high schools and primary schools?

Edit: I felt the need to add that where I live in Canada, university research is mostly funded by government programs like NSERC. The majority of university budgets here come from tuition and government funding, with a much smaller minority coming from the private sector. It is the contention of many academics that private companies should not be able to fund university research at all to ensure that results are unbiased, and that's a sentiment I agree with.

As for Libby, she married Andrei to out do her sisters because he is attractive and very manly and he is ‚ÄúEuropean‚Äù which makes her look (in her mind) more cultured.

Aside from that, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve read or at least are aware of the countless articles detailing the characteristics of Fascist rulers, and how many of them apply to Trump and not at all to a populist like Sanders.

I'd say a goat would be cool - petting zoo style wise you have then got range of reindeer, Dall sheep, the goats, llamas.. And sure these aren't walk through but it would allow a more diverse type of zoo/wildlife park in my opinion

I'm terms of Africa dlc, I would be very happy with penguin, meerkat, black/white rhino and whatever else they add in as I think that would really round off typical zoo animals.

 O presidente, por√©m, ""tem desconsiderado as regras do modelo"", escreve Abranches em seu novo livro, ""O Tempo dos Governantes Incidentais"", rec√©m-lan√ßado pela Companhia das Letras.

 Para ele, que posiciona Bolsonaro sob o pano de fundo da ascens√£o de l√≠deres populistas em diversos pa√≠ses em uma d√©cada de vertiginosas mudan√ßas socioecon√¥micas, esse tipo de governante √© ef√™mero, o que n√£o significa que n√£o cause estragos por onde passa.

    *  

 **A aproxima√ß√£o de Bolsonaro em [dire√ß√£o aos partidos do centr√£o](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/08/bolsonaro-faz-almoco-com-centrao-incluindo-parte-dos-acusados-no-quadrilhao-do-pp.shtml) indica que o presidente passou a jogar o jogo do presidencialismo de coaliz√£o? **N√£o, porque o presidencialismo de coaliz√£o √© um modelo transacional. H√° uma troca entre governo e Legislativo no sentido de uma certa transfer√™ncia de poder do Executivo n√£o para o Legislativo, mas para os membros da coaliz√£o. E ele tem uma voca√ß√£o majorit√°ria, √© uma busca de uma alian√ßa para poder governar.

  No caso do Bolsonaro, ele foi na dire√ß√£o do Congresso em busca de imunidade, quando se sentiu amea√ßado pela quest√£o do impeachment, pelo [processo da ""rachadinha"".](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/06/extrato-de-queiroz-e-novos-cheques-a-primeira-dama-abrem-lacunas-sobre-papel-de-bolsonaro-entenda.shtml)

 Agora, na verdade, ele est√° fazendo uma transi√ß√£o do modelo autocr√°tico voluntarista para um modelo autocr√°tico populista. Por isso ele est√° lan√ßando a extens√£o do aux√≠lio emergencial. Isso ele descobriu por acaso, teve que aceitar o aux√≠lio emergencial for√ßado pelo Legislativo. A√≠ viu como oportunidade capturar o aux√≠lio para ele, e ao ver o impacto disso na popularidade, resolveu prolongar.

 Mas ele caiu numa armadilha, porque de um lado, para manter esse grau de satisfa√ß√£o que ele conseguiu com o aux√≠lio, tem que manter no mesmo plano para que n√£o haja perda de renda real. Mas tem uma limita√ß√£o fiscal, ele tem que arrebentar o teto de gastos e se desavir com uma parte do Congresso e com o mercado financeiro que o sustenta.

 **A √∫ltima [pesquisa Datafolha apontou que](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/08/aprovacao-a-bolsonaro-sobe-e-e-a-melhor-desde-o-inicio-do-mandato-diz-datafolha.shtml) Bolsonaro est√° com a melhor avalia√ß√£o desde o in√≠cio de seu mandato. Como o sr. avalia essa queda na rejei√ß√£o ao presidente? **Claramente Bolsonaro se beneficiou do aux√≠lio emergencial e est√° se beneficiando dessa naturaliza√ß√£o da doen√ßa [Covid-19]. Os EUA est√£o discutindo a amea√ßa existencial √† democracia que o Trump representa, e aqui estamos sob a mesma amea√ßa existencial, tanto da democracia como do nosso modo de vida, e a gente n√£o reage da mesma forma. N√£o h√° o n√≠vel de indigna√ß√£o e mobiliza√ß√£o e acho que nem a mesma clareza das lideran√ßas.

 Estava vendo na [coluna do Conrado [H√ºbner Mendes]](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/conrado-hubner-mendes/2020/07/a-constituicao-e-antifascista-mendonca-nao.shtml), ele discutindo esse papel da Advocacia-Geral da Uni√£o, da Procuradoria-Geral da Rep√∫blica e do Minist√©rio da Justi√ßa na [quest√£o do dossi√™ antifascista](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/07/acao-sigilosa-do-governo-mira-professores-e-policiais-antifascistas.shtml).

 Todos os tr√™s fugiram da finalidade das suas institui√ß√µes. E essa √© a maneira pela qual esse novo autoritarismo se firma, carcomendo por dentro as institui√ß√µes de freios e contrapesos e aumentando o poder discricion√°rio do presidente. Vamos ter de pensar rem√©dios para isso.

 Essa √© a quest√£o fundamental do Brasil. A gente ainda n√£o se deu conta de que tem coisas anormais demais acontecendo, amea√ßando a sociedade brasileira, o padr√£o de conviv√™ncia minimamente civilizado que a gente estava construindo, ainda com todos esses problemas que eu falei, e a nossa democracia.**‚Äã**

 **Neste m√™s, o ministro Dias Toffoli passa o comando do STF a Luiz Fux. Qual o legado que Toffoli deixa e o que esperar da nova gest√£o? **O Toffoli deu um p√©ssimo exemplo de como ser presidente do Supremo Tribunal Federal. Ele se envolveu com os chefes do Poder Legislativo e Executivo para fazer pacto de pol√≠ticas p√∫blicas, algo absolutamente impens√°vel pro chefe do Poder Judici√°rio.

 Ele vai analisar a constitucionalidade das pol√≠ticas p√∫blicas. N√£o pode autocraticamente dar um aval, n√£o pode assinar em nome dos outros dez ministros do Supremo um pacto em favor de coisa nenhuma, a n√£o ser a favor da democracia e da Constitui√ß√£o.

 O presidente do Supremo tem que manter uma certa dist√¢ncia cerimoniosa dos chefes dos outros Poderes. N√£o √© que ele deve ser advers√°rio ou n√£o ter uma rela√ß√£o cordial ou n√£o comparecer a cerim√¥nias oficiais, nas quais o protocolo diz que os chefes dos Poderes devem estar juntos. Agora, posse banal de ministro do Executivo, coisa em quartel, n√£o faz o menor sentido.

 Toda democracia precisa de um certo grau de formalismo. Ela requer certas formalidades. O presidente da Rep√∫blica n√£o pode atravessar uma rua e se sentir bem recebido, como amigo, na posse de um procurador-geral da Rep√∫blica.

 Um procurador-geral da Rep√∫blica n√£o pode sair da sede da Procuradoria e fora da agenda, √† noite, ir visitar um presidente para conversar sobre assuntos que ningu√©m fica sabendo quais foram. Isso aconteceu entre a Raquel Dodge e o Temer, n√£o √© s√≥ o Augusto Aras. O Aras entrou pela porta dos fundos, √© um caso muito pior.

 Imagino que o Fux v√° ter um comportamento mais afastado do Executivo porque ele tem mais experi√™ncia de magistratura do que o Toffoli. O Toffoli era um advogado pol√≠tico que virou ministro do Supremo.

 **Enquanto isso, Bolsonaro vem dando sinais de que pode[ reatar com seu antigo partido](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/08/de-olho-em-2022-bolsonaro-reavalia-neutralidade-nas-eleicoes-municipais.shtml), o PSL, depois do fracasso da tentativa de reunir o bolsonarismo no guarda-chuva da Alian√ßa pelo Brasil. √â puro pragmatismo tendo em vista a elei√ß√£o municipal e o fundo eleitoral do PSL ou o sr. enxerga algo mais nisso? **A motiva√ß√£o principal √© grana, √© o dinheiro do fundo, e as elei√ß√µes municipais. Porque, na verdade, essa √© a primeira elei√ß√£o que efetivamente o PSL vai disputar. Ela que vai definir se ele vai virar partido ou n√£o. Porque at√© hoje ele √© uma casca improvisada, inchado.

 A gente j√° viu isso. O PRN do Collor inchou e desinchou rapidamente. Claro que a gente est√° num processo de realinhamento partid√°rio, as bancadas perderam tamanho. Mesmo o PT, que ficou com a maior bancada da C√¢mara dos Deputados, √© metade do que j√° foi.

 Todos os partidos est√£o em teste. Os tradicionais t√™m que mostrar que t√™m capacidade de renova√ß√£o, de revitaliza√ß√£o. E os novos t√™m que demonstrar capacidade de perman√™ncia. Dos novos o que tem mais que provar √© o PSL, inclusive por isso, foi do Bolsonaro, deixou de ser do Bolsonaro, volta a ser do Bolsonaro.

 **O sr. argumenta que a onda populista j√° come√ßou a perder for√ßa em alguns pa√≠ses europeus porque √© inevit√°vel que os eleitores que os elegeram se frustrem ao longo do caminho. Mas para a democracia emergir revigorada √© preciso que, nesse refluxo, alguma intelig√™ncia pol√≠tica seja capaz de recentralizar o sistema. O sr. enxerga sinais dessa intelig√™ncia no horizonte brasileiro num eventual refluxo do bolsonarismo? **Por exemplo, o [Partido Democrata dos EUA](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/08/democratas-apostam-que-americanos-querem-o-alivio-da-normalidade-apos-anos-turbulentos-de-trump.shtml). O fato de lideran√ßas muito jovens, como a [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/lucia-guimaraes/2020/08/o-desafio-da-inclusao-e-destaque-na-convencao-democrata.shtml), e outras j√° experimentadas, como o Bernie Sanders, da esquerda do partido, se unirem para dizer o seguinte: desta vez a gente precisa de um cara como o [Joe Biden](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/08/em-discurso-de-uniao-biden-se-coloca-como-luz-em-epoca-de-escuridao.shtml), porque a gente precisa unir conservadores, moderados e progressistas contra essa amea√ßa √† democracia americana.

 Isso n√£o tem aqui no Brasil. Acho que essa intelig√™ncia tem. H√° lideran√ßas jovens, inclusive no Congresso, que t√™m essa vis√£o, que o Brasil precisa parar de ficar brigando brigas velhas e olhar para frente.

 Parar de fazer pol√≠tica pelo retrovisor, como a gente tem feito desde sempre. A gente fez a Constitui√ß√£o de 1988 olhando para o retrovisor, para evitar o retorno do autoritarismo. Era preciso que algu√©m olhasse mais para frente, mas tinha a hiperinfla√ß√£o. A gente tinha que resolver esse legado.

 A gente vem suprindo os d√©ficits do passado, lutando contra a parte negativa do nosso legado, e deixando de olhar para frente. Enquanto isso o mundo foi mudando de forma vertiginosa. Agora estamos com um dilema na m√£o. Continuamos com os passivos, porque n√£o fomos capazes de resolver nenhum deles, exceto talvez a infla√ß√£o. E mesmo a democracia estamos vendo que n√£o.

 Estamos com o desafio de construir um Brasil que seja vi√°vel no s√©culo 21 e esse desafio √© grave demais para n√£o termos nenhuma lideran√ßa entre as mais experimentadas do pa√≠s com clarivid√™ncia para ver que est√° na hora de buscar essa intelig√™n",True,False,False,,,,0,1598961859,,False,0,{},g3ksfxu,True,t3_ikizya,False,True,t3_ikizya,/r/brasilnoticias/comments/ikizya/bolsonaro_caiu_em_uma_armadilha_com_aux√≠lio/g3ksfxu/,False,,1611416287,1,True,False,brasilnoticias,t5_3a1qf,r/brasilnoticias,restricted,,0,[]

Greece has decided that a more hardliner stance of literalist readings of UNCLOS (in breach of established case law) and trying to develop and leverage allies to force concessions from Turkey is the right way forward. Cyprus' entry into the EU by way of Greek threat of EU veto is among the more successful chapters of this policy.

Turkey has decided that escalation in the face of developing infrastructure and international norms is the right way to maintain the status quo. Until this EEZ business, this had proven fruitful by keeping the status quo, at least in the medium term.

There is unlikely to be a total winner in all this as Greece's web of allies have proven fleeting in the past and Turkey's hard power shows too troubling to ignore not just by Greece but also the rest of the relevant parties.

How can a 20+ ton animals run around in full speed without knocking down every tree in their way? I don't need any advanced sensors to see the trees are being toppled over in the jungle.

&gt;They didn't have long range weapons because the people of earth didn't want them to have long range weapons.

They have rockets and missiles. Modern rockets can reach targets 8,000 m away. Animals charging in 100km/h will 4-5 minutes to cover that distance, even if they are not slowed down by craters and trees. That is more than enough time to kill them.

&gt;They weren't supposed to be an occupying force conducting a war.

Despite the fact that they have military grade mechs. If you are protecting fixed sites, you could have installed a bunch of automatic turrets everywhere instead. Mechs are used as mobile gun platforms that can move up with a large ground force, which is quite offensive in nature.

&gt;The humans only lost when a giant goddamned wall of flesh hit them and overwhelmed them.

As previously mentioned, the wall of flesh can be dealt with using rockets and incendiaries.

&gt;What modified spacecraft?

The humans in the movie can easily modify a transport ship into a make-shift bomber. Why not do the same to a spacecraft instead?

&gt;you keep looking at this from the perspective that they're a properly equipped military force

They are not completely a military force per se, however, they are equipped well-enough to handle such situation. As long as they use sensible tactics, they should have beaten the aliens. Maybe with some casualties but definitely not going to be beaten.

&gt;because the people of earth are very keenly interested in Pandora, and so are very keenly interested in not being invaders.

Not interested in a place does not mean that you want to avoid invading it. Look at the colonial empires in Europe back in 1600s-1800s. They are not particularly interested in invading a specific place but they still invade and enslave the population anyway.

&gt;Even the mine director is exceptionally interested in avoiding conflict the entire time, because he knows any conflict is going to be a PR shitstorm of epic proportions, much less open war. 

Yet they actually attacked the aliens preemptively. They (at least the military commander) decided to launch an open war with little preparation despite the fact that they have time and resources available. Sure, they are under the threat of an all-out attack.

**Platforms**: PC, PS4, BMO

**Hours**: Mostly NA On the PC side. NA and EU on the ps4 side.  

**Focus**:  Fighting for Funcle Drifter and Crazy aunt Eris‚Äôs love.

We are mostly focused on PvE but that doesn‚Äôt stop us from jumping in to some semi sweaty PvP. We are not a group of super tryhards but we also don‚Äôt like to mess around and spend hours in raids doing stuff just for the luls.

**About Us**: We're Seraphim Elite, Born in 2016, we're a community of guardians split over PC and PS4, with a clan for each platform. We have had an ongoing mission of making an active community and not just an active clan. We believe that what you put in is what you will get out. This isn‚Äôt our clan, it‚Äôs your clan. While this community is mostly centered on destiny we are a place where people can come together and joke and talk about anything from video games to sports and life in general. 

**Requirements**: We do NOT provide carries (Unless you are named Omnislash) and we don't provide welfare engrams. Being a good raider isn‚Äôt as important as being a good raid member. We really want to find people that are a good fit in our community. You will be accepted into the clan upon joining our discord but initially as a recruit. We have a process our new people go through so you can get a feel for the clan and our members before you become a full fledged Seraphim.

**Criteria for joining**

1) Be 18+ Physically and mentally 

2) Have a mic/headset. If we can hear your game or it sounds like you are playing inside a helicopter or in the middle of the freeway you will be asked to leave until you can find a proper headset.

3) Be able to communicate and listen. Be honest about your experience level.

4) Be active in **Discord** and in game.

5) No ~~fucking~~ swearing (This is a joke because some people are bad at jokes or understanding jokes. So you can swear if you want, or don‚Äôt swear I am not the swear police)

6) Speaking of jokes we like to have a good time but being edgy, or racist, or homophobic will put you on the fast track to bansville.

7) Have very strong opinions on what kind of toppings are appropriate for pizza. Also Mayo. Also hating Ohio State University (we can still hate them even though they are not playing until the fall)

So come and say hello and get to know us! We'd love to get to know you more and have you be an active part of our community. Participation in our **DISCORD** server is essential. We do check for in game and Discord activity but the requirements of this activity are minimal (speak a few times a month). We are focused on our community and building online friendships so we feel these requirements should be easy to satisfy. 

If you‚Äôre happy to join a bunch of goofs, we‚Äôre happy to have you! We‚Äôre a great set of people to run raids, sweat in Crucible, and grind new content. If all of that sounds bueno, come join up. Follow the link below to our discord server to get started, and if you can't cause the site is down please wait until it's back up to follow the link!

Does the best possible version of capitalism make people too comfortable and complacent to ditch it entirely? Or does the removal of some of the stress capitalism puts on us provide more opportunities (free time, access to education, etc.) for studying leftist theory and eventually pushing society further to the left?

Let me try and share the perspective of someone from a former Yugoslav country. While I'm too young to have lived in socialist Yugoslavia myself (technically I did, but only for the first few months of my life), my parents lived under that system for 50 years. Over the years, I've heard a lot about what life was like back then from them and others in their generation.

As a market socialist country, Yugoslavia was in some ways a mix of what we today call the Nordic model (market economy with a welfare state and wealth re-distribution policies) and socialism (state-owned enterprises managed by councils of workers and a one-party parliamentary system). On paper, I can imagine a Nordic model country non-violently transitioning to socialism to organize in a similar fashion.

It's important to know, however, that Yugoslavia did not arrive at socialism peacefully. It wasn't exactly a violent overthrow of the capitalist class, but it wasn't totally peaceful either. Rather, it was the result of communist partisans emerging as the local victors of WWII, having suppressed their political opponents during the war (a combination of nazi collaborators, monarchists and liberals). Tito's communists were seen as war heroes and socialist ideology appealed to the relatively poor masses, so they had an easy time securing popular support in after the country was liberated from nazi occupation.

Though the reasons why Yugoslavia failed to sustain this model and eventually broke up are complex, I think there are some lessons to be learned about the risks of transitioning from a parliamentary monarchy with a mostly agrarian market economy to socialism. I believe some of those risks could have been avoided had the country been more developed when it changed political systems. This [Jacobin article](https://jacobinmag.com/2017/07/yugoslav-socialism-tito-self-management-serbia-balkans) is a good read on the subject, so I'll quote some points I believe are relevant and that align with what I've been told about the subject locally.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Ironically, Yugoslav workers‚Äô councils tended to empower managers, engineers, and white-collar workers over the lower-skilled working class. As the councils took over complicated accounting, marketing, and management decisions, the more educated and higher-skilled workers consolidated their authority. Combined with the pressures of market competition and a commitment to wage differentials in order to secure skilled labor, self-management actually increased inequality. Goran Musiƒá, for instance, notes that wages in the early years of the planned economy ‚Äúmaintained . . . a ratio of 1:3.5. . . . By 1967, they had reached a disparity of up to 1:20.‚Äù

A more developed country that did not rely as much on low-skilled labor would have probably fared better in this regard as the difference in the level of education and type of work between workers would have been smaller. The central government could have probably put limits on differences between wages, but likely did not want to disrupt the workers self-management model too much as it was popular, at least in the beginning. In general, the Yugoslav communist party was not as heavy-handed in their policy interventions as their Soviet counterpart under Stalin. Though I generally see this as a good thing, it may have prevented them from making decisions that could have produced better outcomes.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Further, anxious not to erode their popular support, the communist leaders rejected Soviet-style industrialization and collectivization. Instead, they promoted gradual and stabilized industrial growth that required the state to restrict the flow of workers into the factories and to concentrate on building the existing labor force‚Äôs efficiency.  
&gt;  
&gt;This preference for intensive growth produced high rates of unemployment. According to Susan Woodward, in 1952, the official unemployment rate in Yugoslavia was ‚Äúat least two points above the 5 percent then considered the normal rate in Western Europe.‚Äù Thirty years later, ‚Äúthe rate surpassed 15 percent, ranging from 1.5 percent in Slovenia to more than 30 percent in Kosovo and Macedonia.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;Inequality and unemployment were not just unfortunate side-effects: self-management‚Äôs efficacy actually required them, at least in the short- to medium-term.

Again, this would have likely been less of an issue had the country been more developed to being with. High employment and efficiency could not both be achieved in parallel because it took time to educate and train the labor force for a transition to a more industrialized economy. So the country had the choice of inefficient over-employment or efficient high unemployment. Though there was a social safety net, it was not enough to allow the unemployed to live decent lives. This too may have been avoided had the country been wealthier.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;More dangerously, the regional variations in inequality and unemployment reflected the country‚Äôs uneven economic development, which grew out of the different historical legacies of the federated nations.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;In the southern republics, party-state leaders feared the turn toward the market system. The incipient extractive industries and heavy manufacturers in the south required high levels of state investment and, in the short term, greater protectionist measures. These republican leaders also supported the federal tax system, which aimed to fund southern industrial growth by redistributing profits from the wealthier northwest.  
&gt;  
&gt;In contrast, leaders in the northwest wanted to implement an export-led growth model. Consequently, they supported greater economic liberalization and integration into foreign markets. They also opposed the tax plan, arguing instead that more profitable enterprises should thrive, unhindered by state intervention.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;As external pressures intensified, the republics closed off against each other more and more. Not only did they therefore develop different specialisations with different markets in the Cold War, but superpower contestation also made the republics a primary site of the superpower struggle for supremacy. . . . The end of the Cold War presented Yugoslavia with an existential challenge that its institutional design proved ill-prepared to meet, as its debt economy found it difficult to re-finance with the threat of the USSR gone.

This issue is a bit more complex as it doesn't only have to do with uneven regional development, but also with the market pressures inherent in trying to integrate a market socialist country in a global capitalist economy. However, here too I believe that the problem would have been less severe had the southern republics enjoyed a level of development that matched the north-western ones.

After all that economic stress and the eventual death of Tito, whose charismatic leadership and cult of personality strengthened a common Yugoslav socialist identity, the federation was weak enough to fall prey to nationalist movements, many of which were later encouraged by imperialists who saw the country's break up as an opportunity to impose capitalism. Once the situation devolved into civil war and attempts at ethnic cleansing, there was no going back.

In summary, while one could fairly blame the failure of Yugoslav market socialism on nationalism, imperialist meddling and the inherent dangers of experimenting with a market-based model of socialism in a mostly capitalist world, my sense is that the country would have been much more resistant to those threats had it started its transformation from a higher and more geographically equal level of development. Yet at the same time, I'm uncertain that it would have made the move to socialism at all, had the workers felt more comfortable under a better version of capitalism.

Tried to post this yesterday but apparently belongs here in this superthread.

Since 2017 I've really wanted to ride a motorcycle. I love driving cars, and the extra freedom from a motorcycle really appeals to me. I also recon it would bring me a lot of joy, which my life unfortunately currently lacks regularly. I love working on machines (which is only bicycles and gardening equipment at the moment), and would love to just be able to drive without a destination (which I currently can't, since I don't own a car).

A couple of months ago I finally became old enough to start lessons for an A2 license, but because of the pandemic this became impossible. I wanted to do a test-lesson to figure out if it was really something I wanted to spend my money on, but due to the pandemic you can only partake in a test-lesson if you bring your own gear (which I don't have).

Other than that I have a couple more concerns. First of all, safety. My parents don't really want me to drive a motorcycle because of the vulnerability, and I completely agree with them that you are way more vulnerable on a motorcycle. Since I am a very careful, relaxed, and already quite experienced car driver (I've worked as a chauffeur the past 2 years), I think I should be a safe motorcyclist as well. However, you are only part of getting to your destination. What are your views on the safety of driving a motorcycle? (specifically in Europe/the Netherlands).

Secondly, costs and usage. I will be studying for at least the coming 2 to 3 years (depending on my academic choices). Public transport for students is free here and it doesn't take me long at all to get to anything study related, so I won't really get to use my motorcycle regularly. I have roughly estimated the following costs for my first year of riding:

License: ¬±‚Ç¨1000  
Clothing: ¬±‚Ç¨850 (¬±‚Ç¨750 2nd hand)  
Bike: ¬±‚Ç¨3200 250-300cc (¬±‚Ç¨3800 lucky CBR500R (dream beginner bike), ¬±‚Ç¨1500 cheapy)  
Road tax: ‚Ç¨120/year  
Insurance: ¬±300/year  
Total: ¬±‚Ç¨2200+Bike (¬±‚Ç¨5400 250-300cc, ¬±‚Ç¨6000 lucky 500cc, ¬±‚Ç¨3700 cheapy)

I am able to afford it since I work a lot (for a student) and spend little, but it would consume roughly 2,5-3 years of my salary (last year earned over ‚Ç¨2500, but currently unemployed). Are these costs accurate/realistic, and what are your views on the expected low usage given my situation?

tl:dr I really wan't to drive a motorcycle. I've never (co-)ridden one. Concerned because of vulnerability. Unsure about high costs and low usage.

However Intel has actually made performance fast for Zen/Zen2 cores by default for at least some of the functions one example being simple matrix multiplication with numpy which is just as fast in MKL 2020.2 as it was with MKL2019+fix.

Issue is not all functions have a Zen code path yet. See:

https://github.com/pytorch/builder/issues/504
https://danieldk.eu/Posts/2020-08-31-MKL-Zen.html

The later also shows an more complex workaround for Linux based systems. It seems that Intel is actually officially implementing functionality for Ryzen. So let's give them the benefit of the doubt.
 On my Ryzen, all basic numpy tests are faster with MKL 2020 than with OpenBLAS, some are a lot faster.

Not sure we can really blame intel. Vendors are to blame as well as AMD, especially on windows. On linux it's fairly simple to get an OpenBLAS alternative or compile yourself. Good luck with that on windows in a corporate environment with little control.
Vendors like Mathworks (matlab) or continuumIO (anaconda) should by default offer a choice which BLAS to use. Especially with windows the situation is dire as many packages simply are not available as OpenBLAS build.

Last but not least AMD should simply invest more in their software. It's their main achilles heel. Their BLIS isn't great and only Linux, their CUDA alternative isn't great and only Linux. No own x86 compiler like intel, many missing software features for their GPUs. Just look how Intel and NV actually make their money, by software for their hardware, CUDA being the most obvious example.

Leaving aside the fact that you're referring to the country's (previous) administration as ""not mine"", the evidence does not appear to support the conclusion. Here are some excerpts:

From [1] which, to note, is an op-ed:

&gt; In fact it was Trump ‚Äî not Obama ‚Äî who ordered the closure of Russian diplomatic properties in San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and New York City that appeared to be a threat to American security.

This is misleading as the article cites a piece by NYT [2] that clearly states the following:

&gt; The administration‚Äôs response had been expected for the past month, since Russia ordered the American Mission to cut its staff by 755 people ‚Äî a sign of its displeasure after Congress imposed sanctions because of Russia‚Äôs meddling in the 2016 presidential election.
&gt; 
&gt; President Trump has kept his distance from the dispute. He expressed gratitude, rather than anger, toward Mr. Putin when was asked about the Russian president‚Äôs action to reduce American diplomatic personnel.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúI want to thank him because we‚Äôre trying to cut down the payroll,‚Äù Mr. Trump said, ‚Äúand as far as I‚Äôm concerned, I‚Äôm very thankful that he let go a lot of a large number of people, because now we have a smaller payroll.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Putin‚Äôs move was also a delayed reaction to President Barack Obama‚Äôs expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats and his seizure of two Russian diplomatic compounds last year. Mr. Obama was acting after American intelligence agencies concluded that Russia attempted to influence the 2016 election. The administration said there was no decision on whether the Russian government would be allowed to take back those facilities.

Here's another claim from the op-ed:

&gt; In August 2017, Trump signed a bill slapping even more sanctions on Russia ‚Äî this time specifically aimed at the country‚Äôs energy and defense industries. Congress made the legislation Trump-proof, meaning that no executive order could ever undo such sanctions; yet Trump signed it anyway.

This excerpt cites a piece from CNBC [3] which states the following:

&gt; Trump and his secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, had expressed concerns about the sanctions‚Äô possible effects on U.S. relations with Russia. The administration has pushed to improve relations with Moscow but has gotten tripped up by the probe into Russian attempts to affect the election and whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin. 
&gt; 
&gt; In a statement after the signing, Trump said he wanted to ‚Äúpunish and deter bad behavior‚Äù by North Korea and Iran. The president wanted to make ‚Äúclear that America will not tolerate interference in our democratic process.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; However, Trump argued that the measure ‚Äúencroaches on executive power, disadvantages American companies and hurts the interests of our European allies.‚Äù Trump needs congressional approval to roll back sanctions under the measure. 

The Washington Post op-ed by Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK) [4] also appears to make some misleading claims with regards to the Pentagon budget. I have not fact checked the entire article however owing to a lack of time so please excuse me on that front.

&gt; More broadly, under Obama, the Pentagon‚Äôs budget was slashed by 25 percent from 2010 to 2016.

This cites a report by the Heritage Foundation [5] that states the following:

&gt; In total, since FY 2010, the defense budget, including overseas contingency operations (OCO) spending, has been cut 25 percent in inflation-adjusted dollars.[10]
&gt; 
&gt; FY 2010 and FY 2011. While the FY 2010 budget slightly increased the defense budget, the department began cancelling major programs that year. For the FY 2010 budget, the department announced:
&gt; 
&gt; - Cancellation of the F-22 Raptor fighter aircraft;
&gt; - Cancellation of the VH-71 presidential helicopter;
&gt; - Cancellation of the vehicle portion of the Future Combat System;
&gt; - Cancellation of missile defense programs, including the Airborne Laser and the Multi-Kill Vehicle;
&gt; - Cancellation of the CSAR-X search and rescue helicopter; and
&gt; - The end of C-17 Globemaster III military transport production at 205 aircraft.[11]
&gt; 
&gt; In FY 2011, the cuts focused on modernization spending:
&gt; 
&gt; - Ending C-17 production at 223. (Congress blocked the first attempt.)
&gt; - Cancelling the F-35 alternate engine program.
&gt; - Cancelling the CG(X) future large cruiser.
&gt; - Cancelling the Navy‚Äôs EP-X future intelligence aircraft.[12]
&gt; 
&gt; In some cases, these cuts were necessary because the program requirements were not a high priority or because the program was too costly. On the other hand, other cancellations have led to serious problems for the military today.

Note that this is also somewhat contentious as this is fails to take into account the fact that the (then) administration started pulling out of Iraq and was also bipartisan, as stated in a fact check by Politifact [6]:

&gt; **Has the military budget dropped under Obama, and if so, who is to blame?**
&gt; 
&gt; Overall spending on national security includes the Pentagon budget as well as spending by other agencies, such as the Energy Department‚Äôs work on nuclear weapons. Spending increased in 2010 and 2011, but it has fallen every year for four years since then by a cumulative 15 percent.
&gt; 
&gt; Other ways of looking at the question show declines as well. National security spending made up 20.1 percent of the federal budget in 2010, but in 2015 it was 15.9 percent. Over the same period, spending fell from 4.6 percent of gross domestic product to 3.3 percent.
&gt; 
&gt; There are two main reasons for the spending drop. The first is the Obama administration‚Äôs decision to start removing U.S. troops from Iraq and Afghanistan. The second has to do with a process known as sequestration.
&gt; 
&gt; Sequestration refers to the framework for automatic, across-the-board cuts to both military and non-military spending that were originally designed to force bipartisan negotiators in Congress to strike a deal in 2011. When negotiations fell apart, the cuts went into effect.
&gt; 
&gt; The bipartisan nature of the sequestration provision means that both parties merit a share of the blame, experts say.
&gt; 
&gt; The most recent Obama budget proposed a 7.8 percent increase in the base Defense Department budget between 2015 and 2016. The spending bill enacted this fall puts the defense budget on a path to start growing in fiscal year 2016, up about 6 percent from the previous year.
&gt; 
&gt; ""It‚Äôs still not quite as much as the president requested, but it‚Äôs much closer,"" said Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Bottom line: do you have any sources which come from foreign policy experts which I could use? I'm not saying you're wrong but simply asking for better data to examine your claim.

Firstly, while some aspects of what you presented previously are true (ritualised rape, as witnessed by Ibn Fadlan) some there's no consensus on academically - Norse society was a society of farmers first and foremostly (albeit with a heavy dose of toxic masculinity).

Secondly, while that does play to your points, to me giving the pre-Christian Norse a stamp of ""not being Westerners"" plays into current far-right versions of Norse reconstructionism, such as groups that consider the West 'decadent' and wish to return to 'traditional' values.

Thirdly, this all hinges very much on a perspective that Catholic = west, which while true in the sense that Western Europe *was* Catholic also carries the implication that religion somehow 'westernises' (going from how you use the phrase, as a way to ""civilise"" the ""uncivilised"") people, historically speaking. That is not the case, or otherwise Johannes Gezelius the Younger would not have described the (now catholicised) Finland ""a land of scorpions and barbarians"". He clearly viewed Finns as uncivilised people, despite their religious affiliations being Catholic aside of Eastern Finland where Orthodoxy reigned supreme (but in the days before nation states, religion deemed nationality so such Finns were labelled as Russians).

Rather, light cavalry was becoming more and more common from the 15th century because of the appearance of gunpowder weapons. Armor, which was and still is extremely expensive, offered ever lesser protection against ever more advanced firearm. Then came the thirty year wars which was the final nails in the coffins for heavy cavalry (at least in my opinion). A common theme of the thirty years war was the inability of state to get enough funding to raise troops, much less to fund them: Wallenstein was a mediocre commander but he was the guy who could make a lot of money to raise a lot of regiment, therefore he became the ""best"" commander of the Imperial force for quite sometimes. Heavy cavalry was expensive and was no longer effective on the battlefield as Francis I learned it the hard way at Pavia. Therefore the old heavy cavalry were subjected to drastic cost cutting and changes in tactic and equipments: they were less armored, carried gun, rarely used the big ol' lance. This had turned them into cuirassiers. And no, they did not forget any light cavalry tactics from before. Light cavalry had always been the staples of European armies ever since Numdian riders shoved their javelins up the Roman's bum hole. Italians fielded Stradiots (who I view as close relative to the Croat), Spain fielded Jinetes, Crusaders used Turcopoles, Polish fielded Uhlan. They had used light cavalry for a long period of time

As for the Croats and a lot of other frontier forces (Russian Cossacks, Hungarian Pandurs, Bosnian Grenadiers...) these guys brought not so much new tactics or equipment to the table. The Croats were quintessential light cavalry. You could basically give a Mongolian horse archer from 13th century an arequebus and a lobster tail helmet and told him to speak Croatian and he basically became no different to a Croat rider of thirty year wars. What made a Croat different from his compatriot was his upbringing: he was brought up on the border zone where life was a constant uphill battle even by medieval standard. His family would be dirt poor, 9/10 of his siblings would die before they reached 10 years old due to every reasons from a simple cold to some Tartars cutting them to ribbons. He would face his first fight at very young age even by the era standard and by the time he was a grown man he would become a hardy veteran not many could match. This experience honed his skill as terrific fighter. He could go on for days in the cold, live off the land, know whether there was an ambush up ahead, scout the area for routes and ambush. This made him absolutely excellent in his role as a light cavalryman whose main task was to scout, forage for supplies, harass the enemy.",True,False,False,,,,0,1598972658,,1598973449,0,{},g3lhcqx,False,t3_iklbma,False,False,t3_iklbma,/r/WarCollege/comments/iklbma/what_was_the_role_of_irregular_light_cavalry/g3lhcqx/,False,,1611428204,12,True,False,WarCollege,t5_39t8u,r/WarCollege,public,,0,[]

2 - como resolver o problema estrutural da falta de amparo dessas pessoas. O problema √© multidisciplinar, passa por v√°rias institui√ß√µes de amparo (centros de refer√™ncia, defensoria, ongs, igrejas, sociedade civil, governo etc.) e √© o ponto que o/a amigo/a est√° enfocando.

The basic idea is that depicted in Fitz Ballantine's Royal Parchment Scroll of a Black King Alpha and Black Queen Omega. It is an idolization of race, with an emphasis on Europeans/""Whites"" being evil. I have even encountered blacks in real life who have told me, without mincing words, that whites are literally Satan. These ideas of black supremacy have so infiltrated the collective African-American consciousness (and even the European-American consciousness for that matter) that it is hard not to see them as having a part in the racial conflicts we are currently witnessing.

In Rasta, they appear as harmless seeds, but as we know in Scripture, [the enemy has sown weeds](https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-24.htm) in the field. Black pride quickly leads to black supremacy, just like any national pride leads to an inflated idea of superiority.

Cherishing your ethnic heritage, having ""roots and culture"" is one thing, but hating on another ethnicity to define your culture is called racism.

How does history conflict with any of this? Many big names of Jamaican reggae all share anti-white views, to the point where it is inculturated into the music itself. Even Bob Marley is propped up as an idol of black supremacy, but he was half-white! Talk about [too much confusion](https://youtu.be/cdcfrl83zaY)!

A key trait of Rasta is its Judaizing elements, and this has carried over to black culture. Black ""Hebrews"" are the most vicious form of this trend, but they were of course predated by black Muslims and the Masonic-Moors. The emphasis is on a *racial* superiority, likened to, or equated with, the Israelite people. In this regard they totally throw out the Gospel and focus on the Old Testament: how many black people have you met who say they don't eat pork? It's gotten out of hand!

Also you have it backwards. Columbus was not from Spain, he was Italian. Spain was not a super power at the time, they were still consolidating power within their own border. Columbus‚Äôs voyage is the primary reason they became a super power on the ensuing 200 years. 

To give some context the main form of currency in China during the early 20th century (400 years after Columbus voyage) was Spanish Silver Pesos. (Silver mined in Mexico/Peru -&gt; Manila for trade -&gt; China)

Also think about how significant Tomatoes are to Italian cuisine, to some African cuisine, to NW Indian cuisine. Think about how chillis are staples of Asian and Indian cuisine. All that is a direct result of Columbus voyage. 

That‚Äôs not even looking at it in terms of empires and imperialism, Columbus voyage triggered the Spanish golden age (funded by silver lol) and knocked the Portuguese below the Spaniards in the international pecking order.

Let's look at Biden's policy proposals:

* $15 minimum wage - this is clearly something progressives want

* Mandatory 12 weeks paid sick and family leave - not sure why progressives wouldn't like this

* Public Option and reduce Medicare general eligibility from 65 to 60 - these are steps towards MFA and are a huge deal for expanding affordable coverage to tens of millions of people

* Federal negotiation of drug prices (like many European countries do) - I work in public health and this is a big one for reducing healthcare costs

* Actual action on climate change including net zero carbon from power generation by 2035 and rejoining international agreements

* Increase corporate taxes and increase the top tax bracket rate on the wealthy

* $640 billion investment in Housing Trust Fund, $100 billion low-income housing tax credit, $15k tax credit for first-time home buyers and Section 8 housing expansion

* Increased public school funding

* Criminal justice reform and police reform

I guess I look at that and though I can understand why people want Medicare For All instead of a Public Option, many of those things look like the sort of things progressives would be very happy with. I mean it's certainly a more progressive platform than Obama ever put forward. I'm of course fine with marijuana legalization but to me it's a much less important issue than many of the proposals listed above.

I would also say that if someone is truly in a position where they are threatened by Donald Trump's administration, they are probably pretty likely to support Biden.

It's all about the way you look at it and one's own experiences.  I'm sure there are some shitty situations in Denmark, too.  It's probably not as warm as I'd like it to be, either.

So you're saying that the US is very accepting of immigrants?   Well that's not what the news media thinks.   From my experience, it is.  My parents were able to get here on an emergency visa when Iran's political situation turned grim and I was by default a US citizen when I came along several years after they arrived here.   They worked hard, had a welcoming community, and were able to be successful.

The US really is the land of opportunity.  However, that doesn't mean that the opportunity is as easy to get.  I had to work my ass off to get scholarships. I didn't have a trust fund.   I worked and got what I could, took out a loan, and then worked and made good decisions to live modestly and within my limits.

You also need to look at the attitude of the US versus other European-like nations.  They're more collectivist while the US is individualistic.   The US actually had a bloody war with its colonial overlords going to individual rights of people.   

The US was, and still is, the land of opportunity, which means that there isn't a government system there that plucks you up.  No, you're going to have to reach for it.  Even after that, you're going to have to make good choices.  It's about individual choice rather than the collective population holding everyone up.   That makes people stronger and think for themselves.

As I said, we do have some problems that we can fix.   I don't fully agree with the price of medical care here compared to what it is in other nations.   I don't like the government subsidizing student loans which cause an inescapable amount of debt while causing tuition rates to skyrocket disproportionately to wages.

In my own words, ""dhyana"" is just the naked state of being, which is what the Zen Masters were talking about. (As MaZu put it: ""Your ordinary/original mind."")

According to Wiki, ""Dhyana"" comes from the Proto-Indo-European root of ""dheie-"" (""to see, to look,"" ""to show"") and later morphed into ""dhyƒÅ (""to contemplate, meditate, think""). Regardless, it's all the same thing.

It is an evolution from what just become apparent to some people, long, long ago.

""Clear vision""

Anyway, in China, ""dhyana"" came to be referred to as ""ch'an"". 

The character, Á¶™, also has an interesting etymology. 

Apparently, it is a [""Phono-semantic compound""  of Á§∫ and (phonetic) ÂñÆ.](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%A6%AA)

Á§∫ comes from [the pictogram of an altar](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%A4%BA#Glyph_origin) and the semantic root [""to show""](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%A4%BA#Etymology_1); and ...

ÂñÆ, although phonetic, comes from the pictogram of a [net to catch animals.](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%96%AE#Glyph_origin)

Makes me wonder if the sanskrit [""yana""](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yana) might have a similar relationship to ""dhyana"" ...


Anyway, the Chinese used the character ""Á¶™"" to speak of ""dhyana"".

BodhiDharma, whoever he was, was at least from the yogacara tradition. 

The Zen lore claims direct lineage to Buddha.

Thus, either or both of these provide a direct link to the tradition of ""dhyana"" as well, it's not just a borrowed name.

And so ... ""Zen"" = ""Ch'an"" = ""Dhyana"" = ""Just a name for ordinary mind"".

As mentioned above, even when ""dhyana"" came about, it was an abstracted label from a personal and real experience.

The rest is just history.

""Ch'an"" became ""Zen"" and *""Zen""* was the term used to import the ""dhyana"" teaching to the West.

Once a few people in r/zen started to actually read the texts, and realized that ""Zen Buddhism"" was full of shit, ""dhyana"" was rediscovered once again.

The name has just been a moniker all along ... plus, this subreddit was not founded upon a legitimate understanding of Zen either ... it evolved into that.

So, ""Zen"" in 21st century American English on an internet forum seems just as good a term as any to just ""slide"" into.

It's like ... when I speak Italian, I call ""Rome"", ""Roma"" ... I don't call it ""Rome"" ... but the inverse is true when I'm speaking English ... I don't suddenly just whip out a trilled-R ""Rrrrroma!"" in the middle of my discourse. (Interestingly enough, that's how you can spot the wannabes).

What's the saying? ... *""When in Rome ... !""*

So for the LoL World Championship this year, the Vietnamese teams (2) won't be able to attend because of Covid-19 precautions. The typically 24-team tournament will now be left with only 22. After the news broke last night, there's been much speculation over the rumor that NA and Korea would get an additional team, bringing them up to 4 along with China and EU.

But instead, Riot has decided that they would rather reformat and reschedule their entire tournament around an uneven number of teams (in terms of head-to-head brackets, 4 groups of 4 for the main group stage) instead of pulling in a few extra teams. They even say themselves, ""**we were unable to find a format that would allow us to run a double round-robin for this many teams and still give teams the chance to compete in a best-of-five series for advancement**"" which is practically an admission that even *they* can't figure out a standard format with the number of teams they have.

And. I don't know. Obviously I get that it's such an unenviable position to be in. I'm just so genuinely shocked that they'd rather turn their biggest tournament of the year into a weird, confusing mess instead of pulling in two extra teams and being done with it.

Anyway.

No, as I say none of this is to say that independence is a bad idea - it's just going to be more painful now that it would have been then

[],,mmmmmmtoes,1544265620.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_2qrlghl6,False,False,[],"I‚Äôll make sure to connect everything to my main point-the KPD and communism in general had the power to stop the rise of the Nazis, and did not (with a final discussion of how the modern day American left has the power to stop Trump, and in some cases is not), because I guess I wasn‚Äôt super clear about it before.

The SPD being socialist pre-WW1 and pre-USSR is irrelevant. With the rise of authoritarian communism (‚Äúcommunism‚Äù) they rebranded themselves as social democrats, and pledged their full support to the Weimar republic. When you look at Iron Front propaganda of the time it literally says ‚Äúagainst Thalmann and against communism.‚Äù You can argue that was targeted at authoritarian communism only but I don‚Äôt think your average German would care. They did not support a complete societal change as the KPD did.

And you claim they used ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù in their propoganda/campaigning- could you cite an imgur link or something? As far as I could find from there were no instances of this that remotely overlapped with the time of the NSDAP. Which, I‚Äôll remind you, is the only relevant timeline- neither the SPD nor KPD can be blamed for the rise of Hitler before the NSDAP existed, obviously.

And the NSDAP absolutely included ‚ÄúSozialistische‚Äù in its name to appeal to socialists, though it was a very ‚Äúredefined‚Äù version of the word. They had a large left wing, which the KPD repeatedly tried to win over. After all they didn‚Äôt refer to socialism as the ultimate enemy but rather ‚ÄúJewish Bolshevism.‚Äù The SPD, on the other hand, attacked all forms of communism, which is why I‚Äôm confused about your claim that they used socialism in their propaganda. Is it possible you‚Äôre referring to the American left‚Äôs definition (socialism is when government does good things) and not to the stepping-stone phase between capitalism and communism?

My point is that the SPD was not ‚Äúsplitting‚Äù the communist vote. The only sense in which this works is to say that, had it not been for the SPD, people would have voted for the KPD, but I disagree and say that as supporters of liberal democracy they would have voted for the Zentrum. You could argue the SPD was splitting the democratic vote, but that‚Äôs another story.

&gt;With all due respect this is ridiculous, Luxemburg and Liebknecht were members of the SPD just a few years prior...

Yes, and they broke off with the other Spartacists. Anyone in the SPD at that point was aware it was the establishment party of the Weimar republic. Rosa and Liebknecht were democrats up until when they tried to start a revolution with base support of only ~10% of the populace.
 
I‚Äôll cut to the chase and get to the base of your argument/belief system. You believe that it was entirely fair and just for the KPD to view liberalism democracy as equal harmful to Fascism, which as I said is irrelevant to discussing who did more to enable the Nazis and only serves to justify why the KPD enabled Nazis - somehow, even though the Nazis were openly in favor of restoring Germany‚Äôs former borders by force, ‚Äúif necessary,‚Äù the KPD figured a democratic (not monarchist) government would find itself in another WW1 sooner or later. I won‚Äôt really argue this belief, because, like I said, it doesn‚Äôt really change what we believe happened, just the reasoning behind it. 

Your second big point is that, had the SPD embraced the revolution its members truly wanted (which, as I‚Äôve discussed, members of the SPD did not) Germany could have been a successful communist project. Now, there are not many revolutions (not civil wars between two regions but revolutions) that succeeded without the majority support of the population. You cite the Russian civil war - this was a case of people fighting for whoever gave them food and didn‚Äôt kill them. Where the White army had control was where they were able to promise food and protection, where the Red army had control was everywhere else. Sure, the success of the civil war convinced many of the merits of communism, but the revolution was only supported because the alternative was to starve. And of course plenty of people starved anyway, but idk how much of a USSR apologist you are so I‚Äôd rather not bother arguing about the Holdomor.

The other revolution you cite is the French revolution. I‚Äôm not nearly as well-read on it but it‚Äôs my understanding the majority of peasants did support it beforehand. And, again, people were starving.

There was no point in the Weimar era where a revolution could have succeeded except for when people were still starving and penniless after WW1, and a revolution was attempted, and failed. The closest the Weimar republic came to being ripe for one was when the depression hit, however then people were not dying of hunger in the street. And even had a revolution been attempted, the militant wing of the NSDAP was extremely powerful already and could have easily siezed power simply by putting it down.  

And furthermore, you say that the KPD were committed democrats. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard this talking point before, but the French revolutionaries - hell, most left-wing revolutionaries - supported elections post-revolution as well. Every time they have  win, it ended in an authoritarian regime, and this is exactly what the members of the SPD feared. 

To be honest I‚Äôm not really sure the KPD really expected to be treated like a party committed to democracy, seeing as they were a member of the Internationale led by a fully authoritarian government.


Now onto my thoughts about the current election. I‚Äôll try to explain why I‚Äôm supporting Biden, and why I would support him even without the hindsight of knowing what damage Trump has done.

Having lived in Germany (German high school is where I learned a lot of what I‚Äôm talking about) I got to see firsthand what capitalism can look like. Populism was limited, and as a result real evidence-supported policies had allowed Germany to advance economically to the point where they could truly guarantee their citizens would be healthy, safe and able to pursue happiness. The same is true across much of Europe. 

This is what Biden, and most democrats, have been working towards their whole lives. It doesn‚Äôt involve just taking billions from billionares - Europe has plenty too - nor does it involve creating a single-payer healthcare system - Germany has a reasonably large private healthcare industry - nor does it involve abolishing a military. Rather, it involves reforms that have been proven to work, like public healthcare options (like the one Obama and Biden tried to pass), better tax systems (Sweden, for example, has relatively low and simple income taxes but a high added value tax) and cheaper education (Biden has promised to subsidize college near-fully for anyone who can‚Äôt afford it). This is what I believe in-bloodless transition into a system similar to that of much of the EU, which can spread its wealth and democracy via capitalism.",True,False,False,,,,0,1598984301,,False,0,{},g3mdf2p,False,t3_ik1by6,False,True,t1_g3m065x,/r/ABoringDystopia/comments/ik1by6/history_repeats_itself/g3mdf2p/,False,,1611443608,1,True,False,ABoringDystopia,t5_3c6l1,r/ABoringDystopia,public,,0,[]

Quando recebi a confirmacao dos Registos Centrais que atribuiram a cidadania portuguesa ao meu filho (isto pode demorar um par de meses...), tive de ir ao Registo Civil local onde me passaram uma declaracao (nao me recordo do nome) que permitiu ao meu filho passar a fronteira e ir a Portugal tratar do Cartao do Cidadao, etc...

1) For the love of god, use the enter key and add paragraphs.  Your wall of texts is *REALLY* irritating.

2) Making it out of groups does *NOT* make you one of the 8 best teams in the world.  Not all groups are created equally, look at the SKT, RNG, FNC group from last year vs the group that Splyce made it out of.  If you're arguing that Splyce was a better team than RNG then I have nothing else to say to you.

3) I never said NA couldn't make it out of groups.  I was commenting on the OP's absurd fiction of 4 NA teams not only making it out of groups when only 1 time have more than one gotten out of groups, but to have them ALL advance to the semifinals for an all-NA top 4.  I'm sorry, but zero percent chance.

&gt; To me its just everyone is already saying they lost before they even try.

That's what happens when a league is clearly at a lower skill level than the international competition.  It's like comparing an NBA team to an NCAA team or one of the European basketball leagues, or comparing an MLS soccer team to a Premier league football club.  There just isn't a realistic level of competition there, and while that doesn't mean the less skilled region could *never* compete the fact of the matter is that they have basically no chance of winning worlds because that requires a sustained level of performance.

&gt; what happens if the meta that we play in na this year happens to be the meta that worlds shifts to. right there is one small instance where na would have a really good shot at making it out.

Give me even *one* example (since s3) where the NA meta was ever in line with international competition.  The problem isn't one of play-style, it's a problem of both mechanics and communication/macro.  Do you honestly think even a favorable meta is going to allow an NA team to beat G2 in a best of five?  The C9 team from two years ago that was a *really* good roster got demolished by FNC and didn't win a single game in a meta where everything had been upended and no one knew how it was going to go.  That's your best-case scenario.

&gt; and i still didnt see any post about the so called washed up people in it for the paycheck that i listed.

It's not even worth going through the list, why would a top-tier talent capable of playing on one of the better teams in EU move to NA to play in a less competitive region domestically and a weaker region internationally?  In addition, most of the people who were still good enough to play on a decent roster (Febiven and Kobbe to name two recent examples) both went to NA and said it was *AWFUL* and made them significantly worse players... both of who came back to EU and immediately had significantly better performance.

It isn't all just ""washed up"" players though, it's people who just aren't good enough to get on a decent EU team like Jizuuke, Nisqe, PowerOfEvil, Froggen, and Broxah (who I think is actually good, he just wasn't getting on a team the caliber of FNC or G2).

So the thing about Antifa is that there is no group ""Antifa"". There are certain political ideologies or tendencies that are very against fascism, and believe that it is necessary to directly oppose the right wing in liberal capitalist states like the USA so that these states don't end up going over to fascism. Considering the consequences of fascism in the past, e.g. the holocaust, you have to admit that they have a point that that's at least as valid as hardcore anti-communists.

It turns out that ""othering"" a group of people does tend to band them together. For instance, in the New World before European contact there were lots of groups, tribes, and states of indigenous people who saw themselves as unique, and often fought each other. In the 20th century, a political trend called the ""American Indian Movement"" showed up, which argued pretty successfully that indigenous groups had the same issues and problems in common because of white colonialism (until the US government stepped in: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Indian_Movemet#Informants_true_and_false). So, when people present evidence of ""Antifa Plans"", ""Antifa Groups"" and ""Antifa Agents"", keep in mind that this evidence exists because they were looking for it.

That leaves us with the question ""Why do people want to turn antifa into a group?"". The answer is that it's a natural side effect of right wing political ideology. Antifa is hated because far right ideology is common in the USA.

Well for one, the notion of a European society didnt really exist back then, and it doesnt even really exist now (outside of a political notion, and even thats sketchy e.g. Brexit). 



Secondly, interest groups are part of assimilation. Assimilation is a 2 way street. 


Thirdly, In the U.S. (and other countries for that matter), assimilation generally entailed bringing your culture as well. The Germans for example brought aspects of their culture that got ""Americanized"" like Christmas trees, hot dogs etc. Which we do see happening incidentally for Somalis.

Meine, unausgereifte, Idee sieht in etwa so aus, dass die EU eine gemeinsame Armee auf die Beine stellt, die nur der Verteidigung dient (und ggf. Katastrophenhilfe und √§hnliches innerhalb der EU). 

Ein wichtiger Aspekt dabei ist, dass ein gro√üer Wert auf Freiwillige gelegt wird, die das f√ºr ein, zwei, drei Jahre machen. Sie werden da in der Landesverteidigung geschult und w√§ren im Notfall recht schnell Abrufbereit. Aber eben nur zur Verteidigung der EU innerhalb der EU, sie m√ºssten sich keine Sorgen machen in Kriegseins√§tze im Nicht-EU-Ausland hineingezogen zu werden. 

Gleichzeitig k√∂nnte das zur europ√§ischen Integration beitragen. Freiwillig Dienende werden ins EU-Ausland versetzt und lernen dort die Sprache. Die Leute werden europ√§ischer und k√∂nnen im Folgenden auch besser zusammenarbeiten.

Neben dieser reinen Verteidigungsarmee g√§be es dann noch eine Armee mit reinen Berufs- und Zeitsoldaten die sich auch explizit f√ºr Auslandseins√§tze bereit erkl√§rt haben.

W√ºnschenswert w√§re es evtl. diese beiden Armeen strikt voneinander getrennt zu haben, so kann man ""ohne schlechtes Gewissen"" in der Verteidigungsarmee dienen ohne das Gef√ºhl zu haben in gewisser Weise auch Auslandseins√§tze gut zu hei√üen oder gar zu unterst√ºtzen. Inwiefern das m√∂glich ist, m√ºsste man aber noch schauen.

I'd been there a year when I finally met Mr. Murphy, who was trying to get the door from the garage to open with a key card he admitted he hadn't used in 'forever'. I walked him through to the building manager who recognized him immediately.

While she got a new card ready we got to chatting and I asked why I never saw anyone in his offices. ""Success"", he says. His customers had once been a bunch of small local manufacturers, but now he was in the big leagues.

It would be more than a year before I saw Mr. Murphy again, and when I did, boy.

Eu as aplica dupa al 10-lea an de viata al masinii un impozit progresiv, fiecare an in plus, +15% la impozitul pe masina, asa ca pe la anul 15 de viata al masinii sa nu mai fie atat de tentant sa iti cumperi un second hand cu drept de vot.

Prost prost foarte prost. Adica masura asta este excelenta pentru orasele mari (sa zicem ce e peste 70.000 de locuitori). Ai transport in comun, te poti folosi de el. 

De»ôi, masina nu e doar ca mergi cu ea 5 km pana la munca. O folosesti si sa mergi la mare, la munte, la strand, intr-un oras in care faci un city break. In mod ideal, ai avea transport in comun pe care l-ai folosi in calatoriile astea, trenul mainly, dar in Romania de multe ori optiunea asta cade, din motive binecunoscute. 

Totusi, daca stai intr-un oras mic, mediu (gen 30k) si stai la vreo 3-4-5 km de centrul orasului ai nevoie neapƒÉratƒÉ de ma»ôinƒÉ ca sa mergi la munca, la cumpƒÉrƒÉturi, sa duci plozii la scoala sau cand se intalnesc cu prietenii lor, etc. Pentru ca transportul in comun intr-un oras de genul e pus la pƒÉm√¢nt. Ca sa nu mai zic de ce se intampla pe sate. Hai ca din corbeanca sau floresti ajungi usor in bucale sau cluj, dar din lunca bradului mai greu ajungi la reghin. 

Si romanii nu au atatia bani sa isi permita masini noi sau aproape noi (pana in 10 ani). Asa ca mi se pare o prostie sa le interzici oamenilor sa nu mai aiba masini (ca practic aia ai face cu masurile alea) cand ei depind de ele. 

Nici nu am vreo idee c√¢t e impozitul pentru o masina in medie. Ma g√¢ndesc ca o fi undeva la 1500 de lei pe an.

**Who are we:**

We are primarily located in NA, with a few members in Europe. We primarily come from PS4, and have just full transitioned into a PC clan. We pride ourselves on being helpful, and accepting, but also having a good time and a lot of fun.

**What are we:**

We are a group that tries to help each other out, and have a good time doing it. We are, at the fundamental level, a group of friends, who games together in destiny, and in other games!

**When and how to do we play?**

We usually play in the afternoon and evening (any time from 6pm until really late eastern) but can, and do play outside of those peak hours. We play all aspects of the game (Raids, Crucible, Dungeons, etc.

**Who are we looking for?**

As it stands now, we are a clan of around 35 players. We are and are searching for specific types of players, namely people who share in our vision. We want to create a community where everyone, regardless of skill level, or how much they are able to play, is able to achieve all of their goals.

By joining Nevermore, you are a person that wants to find a home where you can have fun, while still getting all the loot your heart desires. But you also want to help others out, and join the community as an active member - both in game, and on our server.

**This sounds great, How do I join?**

If we sound like a good fit for you, the first step is to reach out to me. You can do so either by replying to this post, or sending me a DM. Then, you will have to join up in our discord server. Once there, you will be given time to explore our server, and get to know some of the clan members. Once the admin team is confident that you will be an active enough member, and you feel like we are a good fit for you, you will be pulled into the clan itself.

&gt;Then you've got how he encouraged countries and regions to specialise in a few key products, often primary produce, and become dependant on the USSR, rather than encouraging them to be self-sufficient. A genuine socialist country can't be imperialist, but you'd got social-imperialism most notably towards Cuba by that point.

formed in 1949 the COMECON focused on joint planning and making sure Eastern Europe would not be dependent on the USA

Unlike imperalism which underdevelops and blocks development in the third world the Soviet relationship with Eastern Europe was beneficial, in 1960-73 the average GNMP (the Socialist version of GDP) in the six COMECON Nations in Eastern Europe was almost double that of Latin America in the third world and it was also almost double that of the United States furthermore growth was almost identical to that of the USSR (what strange colonies indeed!)

&gt;Seems they had a good system under Stalin.

They did, their productivity problem stemmed from the fact that their investments in the economy focused more extensively on expanding the existing means of production and not on introducing new techniques, the problem was made worse by an extreme shortage of labor because they lost so many people in World War II and population growth had slowed

(Also Khrushchev focusing on light industry to create a ""consumer Paradise"" as seen in the west completely forgetting that such ""consumer Paradises"" are built on the backs of billions of virtual slaves in the colonies did not help)

I've been having a very good time playing these recently. They're technically JRPGs, but I probably spend like 90% of my time reading text/cutscenes. The previous game, Trails of Cold Steel 3 (Sen no Kiseki 4), had a translated text length of equal size to all 7 Harry Potter books combined. My vocabulary and read speed has had notable gains getting through both of these games. There's text backlog too, which is the real godsend for playing games in Japanese.

Difficulty wise, this is probably at least N2+ at the minimum, though I'd still probably recommend N1+ if you want to have a somewhat smooth experience. Vocabulary wise, it's a wild mix of economic, political, military, fantasy, and a lot of more ""literary"" words that you wouldn't use in normal day to day life (I'll find an opportunity to use Êï£ËèØ eventually). Grammar wise, the setting of the game isn't modern Japan, but in a fantasy Europe (?) like continent, so styles of speech and grammar patterns aren't necessarily the ones you'd always expect to hear compared to media that takes place in modern Japan. 

I've been at N1 level for years now, but I came out of Cold Steel 4 with a pretty sizable spreadsheet of words that I looked up on aedict (even if I know the word, if I felt like checking just in case I always add it to the vocab list on the app). If I could find a way to share a Google Sheets without showing any personal information, I'd be willing to share my vocab sheet. Some really dense sections of dialogue ended up being pretty time consuming to get through due to both vocab, grammar, and wanting to be doubly sure I understood due to it being really plot relevant. My play time ended up being 150 hours for a game that's in the 90-100 hour range from my understanding.

As for why the games are fun, that conversation is more fit for /r/jrpg but the short of it is that this game series (Legend of Heroes) has probably the most detailed/well realized world out of any video game. It's also probably the longest running directly continuous canon out of any video game. The story and events build naturally on top of the extensive world building the writers do, which makes it fun to see what happens next.

First of all you are comparing a modern Albanian dialect to a name that is 3000+ years old. 

Second, there has been some considerable effort by scholars to find Indo-European origins to the name (and Afrodite as a goddess). So if a connection to an Indo-European language like Illyrian or a later local proto-Albanian dialect could be plausibly be made, it would have been made. 

Third, the cult of Afrodite was probably imported to Greece from the Middle East. Ancient writers tell us so and archeological evidence also points to that. It's very plausible that the name, if not Greek, comes from a semitic language (btw naming the planets with the gods of beauty, war etc also seems to have been imported from the Babylonians. That would make naming the goddess with the Albanian equivalent of the planet's name even more implausible)

Fourth, the ancient Greeks didn't hesitate to give credit to other civilizations. They mentioned getting the cult of the goddess from the Phoenicians. If the name was Illyrian they would have known so (there were Greeks who knew Illyrian) and would probably have said so.

Lol, every time AMN has played he's been fucking brilliant. Under Emery he was superb and played part in memorable European victories where we destroyed Napoli and Valencia over 2 legs each, 2 points off 3rd in the league when he took the PL spot in January.

This season, minimal gametime given and he's shut down top wingers over and over again. Then he was finally played properly in the FA Cup........ what happened there again?

Just because Bellerin was younger with his breakthrough doesn't give him an automatic pass for remaining the better player. He hasn't kicked on and he's fell off, AMN has comfortably surpassed him.

No. It was because he was successful in every scheme and plan he had executed leading to his reign over the galaxy. 

That's why he decided to use the unfinished full of weak points death star? Or that he gave the rebels the real plans that showed them the way to the reactor?
He was definitely not ready on Endor and a genius would not be overconfident just because his plans in the past succeeded because of luck and the enemy being stupid.


&gt;It didn't. In the canon novelization of a New Hope, they were on the ship for at least a good amount of hours to a day. This is also considered fast because the Falcon was the fastest ship in the galaxy.
