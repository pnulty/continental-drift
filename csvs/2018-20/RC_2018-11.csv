The Legend of Zelda

is an action-adventure video game developed and published by Nintendo and designed by Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka. Set in the fantasy land of Hyrule, the plot centers on a boy named Link, the playable protagonist, who aims to collect the eight fragments of the Triforce of Wisdom in order to rescue Princess Zelda from the antagonist, Ganon. During the course of the game, the player (seeing Link from a top-down perspective) navigates throughout the overworld and several dungeons, defeating enemies and uncovering secrets along the way.The first game of The Legend of Zelda series, it was originally released in Japan as a launch title for the Family Computer Disk System peripheral in 1986. More than a year later, North America and Europe received releases on the Nintendo Entertainment System in cartridge format, being the first home console title to include an internal battery for saving data.

Even the economic system has more going on in it than just capitalism.

&gt;The foundations are capitalism

The foundations are as much feudalistic as they are capitalistic.

&gt;but then we are at ""capitalism misallocates resources"".

No, we aren't. You're still blaming capitalism without a mechanism in mind and without taking other factors into account.

&gt;But that doesn't really cover it, because under capitalism starving people isn't a misallocation of resources if those resources are making a greater profit elsewhere.

Resources don't generate profit, they generate rent. Capital generates profit.

And it would be weird if capital would generate more profit creating luxury goods than creating food for people who are literally starving. Capitalism doesn't seem to provide any explanation for such a weird circumstance.

&gt;because wasted code is a good bit different from wasted food.

Not really. In both cases you have a nominally large amount of production that then gets pared down to an apparently smaller amount of production due to refinement. You end up with a smaller amount of more useful product. As long as the increase in usefulness more than outweighs the reduction in amount, this is efficient to do.

&gt;&gt;What other factors went into creating that state of affairs?

&gt;The drive to maximize profit.

In what sense? Maximize total profit across the entire economy? Maximize the profit of each individual company? Maximize the profitability of capital? And how would it lead to people being unable to afford things? You'd think more profit would be collected in a world where people *could* afford things.

&gt;Yes it is.

No, it isn't. Capitalism is literally not about land.

&gt;Without the theft of land via things like enclosure in Europe, or the forced displacement of native people outside of Europe, Capitalism wouldn't have gotten off the ground.

Why not? Does capital magically lose its usefulness in a world where people can freely access land? I'm not seeing it.

&gt;I don't see why wages necessarily go down as productivity increases

I didn't say 'as productivity increases'. (Productivity of what?) I said 'as civilization advances'. And I explained this pretty thoroughly later in my previous post. ('It's a natural consequence [...]')

&gt;Like a right to life...

A right to *not be killed* would be more precise. Nobody has any obligation to keep you from starving, but they do have an obligation not to stab you in your sleep.

&gt;like a right to a decent wage in return for labor performed?

There is no such right.

You have the right to enjoy the full amount of wealth that your own labor produces. (And 'enjoy' includes being able to invest it and collect whatever profit comes from it, which is why capitalism is morally necessary.) You do *not* have any right to be guaranteed that this amount is above any particular absolute level. If you did, we would be under an obligation to halt the progress of civilization in order to protect the value of labor (see above).

&gt;Yep, even more so really...

I find that doubtful.

&gt;As where you stand now is built on a foundation that comes from people working together.

Division of labor is one thing, but it does not imply people giving up their wealth to others.

&gt;For example, unless you wen't to completely private schools your entire life your education is based on people giving up some of their wealth to help everyone else.

Not necessarily. Maybe public education could be funded using unearned wealth.

&gt;vegetables discarded because they didn't look like how people expected them to look.

Apparently because nobody is willing and able to pay enough to have them *not* discarded.

&gt;Yes, thanks to things like enclosure and such. You, as a private individual, can't just walk out there and throw down a farm wherever you feel like.

Ah, so it's a limitation on land. Once again, this isn't a capitalism problem.

&gt;If you were hungry would you be content to starve?

No, but this is irrelevant. My lack of contentment doesn't create an obligation for anyone else. Only their interference with my life can create an obligation for them. If they have done nothing to stop me from working to sustain my own existence, they are under no moral obligation to help sustain my existence if my efforts fail.

&gt;Evolution is an ""is"" not an ""aught"".

So is survivor bias.

&gt;We are economically invested in everybody's success.

Not to the point of sacrificing our own.

&gt;The tubers collected from a days gathering weren't ""capital"", it was food.

Indeed. But the spears and stone axes were capital.

&gt;Then why isn't that what we see now?

It is what we see now.

&gt;Companies making massive amounts of profit

No. Companies are collecting massive amounts of *rent.* Actual profit margins are not particularly high, and have gone down since the mid 20th century.

&gt;why then does wealth become increasingly concentrated at the top over time.

Because of private landownership and other such rentseeking.

&gt;In a way that maximizes profit, but ignoring externalities when possible.

No. Ignoring the externalities doesn't increase your profits. And across the entire economy it actually decreases profits. It's bad for capital investment.

&gt;The difference there is that the capital investors and the landowners aren't the ones a) doing the work

The workers aren't the ones providing the capital, either. If they were, they would have no need to do business with a capital investor.

&gt;One where the capital investors and the landowners hold all the cards.

No. Capital investors hold the capital card. Landowners hold the land card. Workers hold the labor card. There is no fundamental economic principle guaranteeing that any of these has greater value, and thus bestows greater power, than any other. However, the advancement of civilization tends to increase the value/power of the land card compared to the others.

&gt;Workers, individual, don't have any room to negotiate...

Only because the land has been taken away from them. This is not a capitalism problem. No amount of capital can deny a worker the option of leaving and striking out on his own. Only the unfair control of land can do that.

&gt;No it isn't. It is the company that is choosing to maximize profit over people having clean water.

Denying people clean water doesn't generate profit, it generates rent. Denying people *anything* doesn't generate profit, it generates rent. Profit is a reward for a *productive* activity, namely capital investment, which doesn't take anything away from anybody.

&gt;I'm talking about an increase in rent... the company paying for the consequences of its pollution.

The rent is generated anyway. If the company *doesn't* pay for the consequences of its pollution, that just means it collects the rent.

&gt;But then they'd stop benefiting.

&gt;Sen. Trumbull attempted to assure Senators that Indians were not “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States. Sen. Johnson argued that Sen. Trumbull was in error in regards to the Indian’s not being under the jurisdiction of the United States. This must have raised concerns with Howard because he strongly made it known that he had no intention whatsoever to confer citizenship upon the Indians under his amendment, no matter if born within or outside of their tribal lands.

Yeah, it was not intended to apply to Native Americans.  Again, there is no doubt or debate on that.  But the debate between Cowan and Trumbull certainly made clear it would make the children born of Chinese citizens.

Edgar Cowan Pa: I will ask whether it will not have the effect of naturalizing the children of the Chinese and gypsies born in this country?

Senator Trumbull: Undoubtedly.

Cowan: \[Uses xenophobic fear mongering to suggest that California would soon belong Mongolian or Chinese rather than the Indo-European races.\]

Trumbull: I should like to inquire of my friend from Pennsylvania if the children of Chinese now born in this country are not citizens?

Cowan: I think not.

Trumbull: I understand that under the naturalization laws the children who are born here of parents who have not been naturalized are citizens.  Is not the child born in this country of German parents a citizen?

Cowan: The honorable Senator assumes that which is not the fact.  The children of German parents are citizens; but Germans are not Chinese.

Trumbull: The law makes no such distinction; and the child of an Asiatic is just as much a citizen as the child of a European.

In another interview he asserts that he doesn't have the 'confidence' that Sam has in establishing 'reason' framework in the place of religion and for the masses to adopt such. This has been echoed by Dan Dennett etc throughout the years, and I'd be sure Sam is familiar with this argument.


---


Here's my thoughts on this:


Murray's goal does not run *counter* to Sam's, it's simply a different lane. Murray want's to slow the rollback of Christianity to prevent the insurgence of other religions in its place. He simply isn't as confident Reason will prevail (regardless of if he believes it *should*).


I must say as a hard-and-fast atheist, this has previously seemed unproductive to me, and (similar to you) counter to the cause of Reason. But in more recent years I can see the 'preserving our ethical/traditional roots' argument having a bit more weight to it. That's not to say I support church or prayer, or religious texts or commandments or religiously mandated action. I mean more in a historical sense, not dismissing its impact out of hand, and not being so quick to remove its style/language/traditions. Again as an atheist this feels strange to think this.


---


As a quick finishing analogy:


On census's for a country (in my case Australia) the 'Other' or 'No Religion' status has been rising. Yet these numbers jumping ship from a religion into the atheist/null category are not coming from Eastern religions. They are (I would estimate anyway) coming from Christianity. 


So this is not strictly a global fall in religiosity (though I do believe that is overall happening), but instead a fall of Western religion, making way for the growth of religions like Islam.


That is something to at least note, if not be concerned about, and I believe that analogy extends beyond just religious identity.

“I salute the arrow and the gun.” -Sri Kaal Ji Ki Ustat, Bachitar Natak 


Shastar Naam Mala has 858 verses written in praise of guns. 


Twareekh Guru Khalsa, Gur Pad Prem Parkash, and Suraj Parkash, premier works on the life of Guru Gobind Singh, have numerous references to the tenth masters’ admiration for guns. 


Guru Gobind Singh’s instructions to his army were: 
ਤੀਰੋ ਤੁਫੰਗੋ ਬਡੋ ਰਾਮ ਜੰਗੋ ਧਮਕ ਧਾਰ ਅਣੀਆਰ ਕਮੰਦ ਕੋਰੜਾ॥ ਪੰਜ ਸ਼ਸਤਰ ਪਰਵਾਣ॥
Of the six weapons mentioned here, three: ਤੁਫੰਗੋ, ਬਡੋ ਰਾਮ ਜੰਗੋ, and ਧਮਕ ਧਾਰ are guns. 



Here is further evidence from Twarikh Sikhan written in Farsi by Munshi Khushwaqt Rai in 1811. The following is related to the formation of the Khalsa and Guru Gobind Singh Ji’s transformation :

“ਅਜ਼ਾਂ ਰੋਜ਼ ਜ਼ੁਨਾਰ ਬ ਸ਼ਿਕਸਤ, ਵ ਲਿਬਾਸ ਨੀਲਗੂੰ ਅਖ਼ਤਯਾਰ ਕਰਦ, ਵ ਜ਼ੈਵਰ ਆਹਨੀ ਗੁਜੀਦ, ਵ ਵਜਾੱ ਗ਼ੈਰ ਮੁਕੱਰਰ ਨਮੂਦ,ਨ ਦੋ ਸ਼ਮਸ਼ੈਰ ਬਰ ਕਮਰ ਬਸਤ, ਖ ਕਾਰਦ ਵ ਚੱਕ੍ਰ ਵ ਤਪੰਚਾ ਵ ਕਮਾਣ ਵਗੈਰਾ ਹਰਬਾ ਹਾਇ ਆਹਨੀ ਬਰਖ਼ੁਦ ਆਵੇਖ਼ਤ | ਵਦਸਤਾਰ ਬ-ਕਦਰ ਯਕ ਦਸਤ ਦਰਾਜ਼ ਬਸਤਨ ਆੱਦਤ ਕਰਦ | ”

“From that day the Janeoo was broken. The Blue dress was adorned. Sarbloh (Carbon Steel) ornaments were adorned. A distinct appearance was made. Two gallant baldrics with swords were put on, along with weapons belt, a knife, _Chakram_ (rounded mental quoit), a pistol, bow, and other such weapons and ornaments were adorned. The wearing of an _Ucha Dumalla_ (tall style of Turban) was introduced.”

Not, we could theoretically create a european style football league where each division has 15 teams and you play everyone once, 7 home, 7 away and the top two play for a title or something.

Conversely, driving in Europe was a nightmare to me because they roads were narrower than in California, and there were no proper exits with loop-arounds if you've taken the wrong one or want to go in opposite direction, like how we have 4-loops here.

Instead, roads just forked off into two in the middle like Ys and the ""exit"" could be in either direction - left or right, and the main-road could continue in either direction.

- Attack on Titan (2013) is a dark action series about fighting man eating giants. The anime has incredible animation and an awesome soundtrack I also think it has one of the best first two episodes in anime. One of the most popular anime out there. Lots of mystery and cliffhangers.

[Attack on Titan OP 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvpZHdC80lE)

- My Hero Academia (2016) Is for you if you like the Marvel or DC superhero films a typical underdog rises to the top story but it’s really well executed and has a cast of beloved characters with some good action and a great soundtrack. Also good for newcomers one of the most popular anime out there right now along with OPM and AOT.

[My Hero Academia OP 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu0HjPzFYnY)




- JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012) Generational action shonen that involves multiple characters throughout time. Adapted from an older manga that is still going after decades. Has a very unique sense of style with a really creative battle system that makes it standout from many action shonen. Would give it until episode 12 to know if its for you. (Part 1 is considered the weakest of the 8)

[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 1 OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_vux8N4dy4)

- One Punch Man (2015) This anime has some amazing animation done for it. One Punch Man I think has one of the best fight scenes in anime. It also kind of parodies the battle shonen (basically the tropes present in superhero movies and anime like DBZ).

[One Punch Man OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atxYe-nOa9w)

- Mob Psycho (2016) Similar to OPM in that it is an action comedy (same author) about a psyhic boy and his mentor a con artist fighting other psychics and the various spirits that plague their city.

[Mob Psycho 100] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTvKNoru41Q)

- Redline (2009) Adrenaline the anime.

[Redline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t26m_Q6ENo)

- Death Note (2006) Supernatural crime/detective drama about a book that allows you to kill anyone in the world if you know their face and name. Main character plans to use it to create a utopia vs other main character and detectives who try to stop him. A story of psychological battles and tricks to gain an upper hand. A very well regarded anime.

[Death Note OP 1]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QE9cmfxx4s)


- FMAB (Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood) (2009)A boy makes a Faustian bargain and has to revert the consequences by going on an adventure to find a mystical stone of alchemy the philosopher stone. Deals with imperialism, militarism, redemption, forgiveness, the value of human life and science vs faith and the pros and cons that both have when taken to extreme and not regulated. I would recommend the dub for this one I usually will say watch in subtitles but I like the dub for this anime better. 

[FMAB OP 1]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PusR3agGeio)




- Legend of the Galactic Heroes (OVA 1988-1997) Like Star Wars in a way but with more focus on space battles and politics pitting a corrupt democracy against a virtuous authoritarian state rather than a light vs dark battle with space magic. Some incredible characters and interesting conflicts regarding war, governance and human nature.  Overall a great epic space opera. My personal favorite anime of all time by a large margin. Recent remake not a bad adaptation but it is a bit rushed and only covers the first book OVA covered all 10 plus the prequel Gaiden.

- A Silent Voice (2016 movie release) Deals with redemption group think, bullying and suicide. Film has some awesome shots and a unbelievable soundtrack. One of my favorite redemption stories ever. I would also read the manga after finishing it though as the movie does exclude some side character development. It’s more of a low key romance and does have some comedy but the focus is on the inner turmoil and drama. (still awaiting a legal release of the film in NA manga is available though in NA. Seems like a legal release is coming soon finally sigh)

[Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfK6UgLra7g)


- Shirobako (2014) An anime literally about making anime. (if you enjoy this see Bakuman an anime/manga about making manga)

[Shirobako OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e9S2z3vPhI)

[Bakuman S2 OP2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkEQ58iMmNg)

- Psycho Pass (2012) A cyberpunk detective story and one of the better villains I have seen in anime has some interesting views on society and creating a utopia with some good action as well. I would say it’s like Minority Report if you have seen that movie. 

[Psycho Pass OP 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWBDuVCuiUQ)


- Yona of the Dawn (2014) action/adventure with an Asian low fantasy setting. Lots of character development occurs regarding the main character throughout the series one of my favorite Female MC’s (her journey from spoiled princess to dashing rogue is wonderful). You might have to switch to the manga when you are done with the anime unfortunately. Manga is fairly successful but it’s been awhile since the last season. Author is a fan of LOTOR and it kind of has the epic adventure aspect of that.

[Yona of the Dawn OP 1]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfgNlVdDnxs)

- Haikyuu! (2014) If you want to see a sports anime that definitely keeps you hyped and engaged. Overall has a fairly good and wide range cast that receives some development. Even if you aren't a sports fan I think it’s a great watch. 

[Haikyuu! OP 1]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2---3Iysnqg)

- Saga of Tanya the Evil (2017) While the premise is pretty strange in some ways the main character being the age/gender they are reincarnated in is more to shield her true nature and have people underestimate her. The premise is basically magic World War I (with some WW2 elements) with the author actually throwing in a few historical references here and there. 

[Saga of Tanya the Evil Op](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMwlVyfy3m4)

 - 3-Gatsu no Lion (2016) Is also worth a shot it deals with a pro shogi player (Shogi is like chess though there are a few differences) dealing with depression and overcoming it. This one is another favorite but it’s a slower anime so just be open to the fact. It also has some wonderful side characters and can be quite funny at times. The shogi scenes are also really good even if you don’t know the rules since the focus is on the psychological battle between the two characters and Shaft really did a lot of great work on the imagery.

[3-Gatsu No Lion OP 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKWqPXkLgzY)

- Code Geass (2006) Is another really popular anime deals with the moral complexities of revolution and rebellion. It takes place in an alternate history and it’s also a pretty good intro to the mecha genre. Some great character development and moral dilemmas that the characters face. (mecha shows that involve big giant robots think Transformers but people pilot them)

[Code Geass OP 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ7zQbMxm28)

- Cowboy Bebop (1998) An action space series animation holds up amazing well today also had one of the best endings in anime. Episodic mostly with a few overarching plot lines. One of the more well regarded anime out there and one of my favorites. There is some pretty good humor as well. It’s basically a space Western if you have seen Firefly it’s somewhat of like that. Also recommend the dub for this one.

[Cowboy Bebop OP]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI_8PUXx2A)

- Ghost in the Shell (Movie 1995) (SAC 2002) It’s a cyberpunk action/mystery story with a focus around what human consciousness is. SAC is more focused as a crime action drama. Both are highly praised.

[Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex 2nd GIG 2004 OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQIqgxeNtl0)


- Violet Evergarden (2018) Beautiful animation from Kyoto Animation. Mostly a slice of life series in a post war world (somewhat like post war Europe after world war 1). Focuses on an emotionally stunted child soldier who is learning more about human emotions and how to convey them in words. Mostly a slice of life series though there are more action segments towards the end.

[Violet Evergarden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFVKmVTAHpk)

- Barakamon(2014) A Pro calligrapher named Handa is exiled to an isolated island away from Tokyo to reflect on his actions after attacking a well respected calligrapher after critiquing his work. Story is mostly a comedy/slice of life with various antics with the locals and Handa but can also be fairly introspective and heartwarming.

[Barakamon OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vvL3z3pAs0)



- Vinland Saga(manga only now but anime in production likely late 2019 early 2020) Takes place in the early 11th century towards the end of the Viking Age. A story that can be summed up in one world STRUGGLE. Not just the violence but living day to day in unstable world. Deals with the realities of war, slavery and political chaos that defined Europe after the Fall of the Western Roman Empire. Hopefully it sees a good adaption.

[Vinland Saga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rwiua0hXOVo)


- The Promised Neverland (anime Winter 2019) Anime about children escaping an orphanage after discovering a horrifying secret. Battles of wits and of late has been my favorite Jump title (up to chapter 34 end of volume 4 of the manga).

There’s no chance you’re going to be right one way or the other about which server regions have higher skilled players. And your precious Tfue doesn’t play on EU servers just ErycTriceps doesn’t play on NA. It’s not like players hop around servers looking for the sweatiest lobbies.

Grappler was controversial but eventually embraced by the community as people found ways to counter it. Turbo building crossed the line for a handful of players but ultimately widened the skill cap so players liked that.

So with the election coming up it is important we learn a thing or two about Socialism. Socialism has never worked in history, it didn't in China, in Russia, in India, in Venezuela, in the Middle East, in Africa or any continent on Earth. Instead the only thing it managed to achieve is to set countries back.

Venezuela had a temperate climate, a lush terrain, world's largest oil reserves and a seaside location that makes it easy to deliver its goods ands services all around the world. Venezuela literally won the lottery of geography and could have easily became a paradise in South America. But why did it fail? 

Socialism.

India is a democratic country who thanks to blessed location, geography and natural resources could have became the economic superpower of the world easily with the right guidance. In fact right now thanks to its huge population the Indian Youtube channel TSeries is about to eclipse Pew Die Pie as the largest channel on YouTube. It boasts of a space program that Australia don't have and is predicted to be next economic giant alongside China. But yet why is India today still so poor, why did it only started growing quickly since the 90s?

It's because the IMF forced them to liberalise their economy and get rid of socialism.

The USSR was the superpower of the world, it defeated the Nazi scourage, it sent the first man to space, it developed the AK47 and will forever be known to mankind as the first pioneers of space explorations. But yet why did it fail?

It's because it's people realised a Big Mac tastes better than the lack of food they got under socialism.

China is now one of the economic superpowers of the world, its one of the few countries that have a station in space, it boasts of a high speed rail network and major tech companies like Huawei, Lenovo, Tencent, Alibaba that are amongst the best in the world. But yet how did a country with such potential cause tens of millions of its citizens to starve to death? 

It's because of socialism. And without it a few of my relatives could still be alive. 

Even in the European countries like Norway/Sweden, the models of socialists everywhere did not come at a great cost. Sure they have free unis, hospitals, amazing welfare systems etc, but yet does anything come freely? Nothing ever is free and the price tag is extreme income taxes up to 61.85% just so you can spend more than half your hard earned money to pay for everyone else.

That is the paradise socialism envisioned, and that is the cost you must be willing to pay. Young people of Melbourne, it is up to us and no one else to build a better Australia for our children to live in. If we are to respect the victims of history we must understand them, learn from them and not repeat their mistakes again. 

If we can do that fellow Australians, then the countless victims of socialism did not die in vain.

Do I think a Jew born in 1970 should get reparations for the Holocaust? No, because they didn't go through the Holocaust. Nice try, but it's a swing and a miss, I'm afraid. 

You should put more effort into actually bettering yourself, rather than blaming everyone else.

It's not, it's Poland's fault, because after the iron curtain fell they were more interested in leaving than building the nation up.

Maybe if Poland didn't try to measure its tiny cock, with a destitute military (see, funny thing, Poland was mismanaged before the war), it wouldn't have been fucked quite so roughly.

Ask yourself; what is Huber doing right now during these recent days. What is his title? Who does he report to? Think on that.

The federal reserve, well.. what a beauty! Talk about David and the Goliath. Seems we’ll be going through some hard times soon. Markets indicating something special (signaling **crash**?).

It is too late, IMF will not stop warning about it. Their whole system will collapse and the petro dollar will be no more. Welcome to the new system: a system regulated by congress again, as always intended by our forefathers and Article I of the constitution. And guess who gets to poke and troll the beast the whole way? POTUS. He has been ramping up his hints, have you noticed?


&gt; “If the Fed backs off and starts talking a little more Dovish, I think we’re going to be right back to our 2,800 to 2,900 target range that we’ve had for the S&amp;P 500.” Scott Wren, Wells Fargo.

-DJT Twitter, yesterday 8:53 AM EST.

Drip drip drip, getting the people ready.. tax cuts have bought us time, tax cuts round 2 will buy us more (next week? Watch and see!)

Yet, not right or lefty majorities understand the typhoon about to hit the markets. This is the ultimate goal of the plan. DESTROY what **powers** the cabal; their global central banking slave plantations. **Debt is their power over you**.

Let’s move on to other things;

**Saudi Arabia.** It is true, they have been vile, but **controlled** for many years by the deep state. In order to get their oil in an agreement we made decades ago a trade deal with lesser POTUS’ for military protection and the requirement that they use the USD (the debt note/petro dollar). Now DJT has *signaled* the fall of the Fed again here, but it is missed by people like you who do not look. He does so by telling Salman to start thinking about paying for the military... peculiar? Why no, not to an untrained eye. This looks more like retribution to the common American, unless you know about the historical significance here: said petro dollar deal mentioned before. This is one of the many parts of the world peace plan: Saudi Arabia is also mentioned as ‘Wonderland’ from the leaked HRC emails, and HRC is Alice. What is SA known for? Corruption. Pedophilia. Deep state. Who was arrested Nov 4th 2017? What was Las Vegas shooting really? The SA arrests were the start of the Saudis *own* liberation.

**North Korea,** is it a plus or minus? Congratulations, NK is no longer a threat. Part of the world peace plan of the grand plan.

**European Union**. Is this one not self explanatory? Where do the Rothschilds, Soros, **Payseurs** come from? Why, history is important indeed, agreed? Remember central banks here. This is part of the world peace plan and also involves part of the grand plan to topple their global monetary socialist system of debt slaves: freedom to our world.

**China**. The greatest threat currently to the world, by far. Russia (tried) to be blamed? Event (WAR) needed? Who had access to HRC’s server? WHO was close to Feinstein (think Chinese spy report)? Feinstein was the senator to...? California &gt; Silicon Valley &gt; ‘Silicon Valley of the World’ think her Shenzhen ties. Google in process to build most advanced censorship search engine for China? **DRAGONFLY** - POTUS warns google against acting in Chinese interest and VPOTUS has made statement recently at a certain university laying it all out. Who stole multiple STATE SECRETS from us through HRC server? China. Who really launched the missile from Hawaii? Look at reports regarding China stealing (given) our military launch codes. Many more traitors. This is part of the world peace plan to reign in China.

Deep state? Wait and see, think Huber again. This is part of the JUSTICE plan of the grand plan.

All of these things simultaneously took off at once January 20th 2017. There is so much more.

Once you calm down and start getting your emotions in check, you may want to start thinking things through, even though your feelings feel painful right now. Tears in fact often reflect emotional pain as well as physical pain, so working through the pain is key to your long term personal growth.

Your boss, despite being the paragon of virtue and patience he is, reacted with surprise, sadness, impatience, anger and almost certainly with *criticism*. You may or may not know this, but one of the surest ways of killing enthusiasm in an employee is by criticism. Unless you know whether or not they can benefit from *constructive* criticism or not, it is pure poison.

Prevention would have helped immensely in this situation. But when he called you, it was a *fait accompli*. What did he want? Perhaps wisely, he wanted to make the best of a bad situation, that the situation doesn't end up being a total loss/disaster. 

But did he motivate you? He left you worried, and the worry cooked in your head during the train ride, so that when you reached the store, you were in panic mode (again, how can you go backwards in time?), you burst into tears of regret, humiliation, self blame, fear of inadequacy. In front of an innocent bystander, no less. At least she had the human decency to comfort you. But probably she was more confused rather than uncomfortable. People are not used to the forced intimacy of having to comfort acquaintances, but I imagine that she did her best.

Did he examine the cause of the mix up? Did he make any effort to remove 110% of the blame from your side? Did he agree to the unrealistic promise and commitment you made that ""this will never happen again.""? Are you promising that life doesn't happen, that an unforeseen emergency room situation will *not* take precedence over your irreplaceable presence? He *needs* to bring you back to functionality as a dependable, responsible employee and not as some abject servant groveling before her master. He needs to work on putting you into an ""I'm OK, You're OK"" position, not to keep you in the ""I'm Not OK"" state.

If you work in sales, you may know of a Chinese saying ""A Man Without a Smiling Face Must Never Open a Shop."" When you deal with customers, you should put them at ease, appear to be pleasant and happy to see them, serve them and thank them for their business. Being a manager or an employee is no different. Basic human relations are part and parcel of your professionalism.

Curiously, I decided to comment on your post because [I watched a Youtube video of Yannis Varoufakis talking about his role in the Greek debt crisis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKaPeWoS7PQ). He obliviously admits that he criticized the central bankers, European politicians and diplomats who were trying to help him dig himself out of a hole. He in no way blamed himself or Greece, or searched for a creative solution where his lenders could save face. He actually prefers to be in Omonia Square demonstrating against the powers that be rather than responsibly and pragmatically cooperating with ""the devil himself"", despite the voters having voted the left wing party in by 60%! He admits that Left wing parties not only criticize their opponents but each other!

Only one left wing pundit ever talkes about common human decency and politeness, that would be Slavoj Zizek. Even he brings up Freudian issues, for example that our current civilization oscillates between Perversion and Hyseteria, and other things that would make your mother blush. [Zizek puts a lot of emphasis on politeness as a social imperative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm8NyQwW0OY&amp;t=55m) (polite tolerance between neighbors in his Google talk, the Bartleby quotation ""I would prefer not to"", which I translate as ""Thanks but no thanks""), perhaps because he is still seeking a win win solution for human relations.The idea is to keep on negotiating (or ""struggle"") for personal and social goals, but without antagonizing the ""big Other"". Of course, he sets politeness in opposition to vulgar right wing people like Donald Trump, Sarah Palin, Berlusconi, etc.

To conclude, you've already been advised to keep your emotions in check. That might be impractical advice. Your long term goal (as opposed to the urgent oscillations your emotions are currently experiencing) is to use your god given rational side to 'balance' your emotional side, to examine the facts, verify your 'psychic map' so that it reflects a neutral reality. Make use your close friends and relatives to examine your feelings and map out a practical strategy so that, in the long term, your professionalism, dependability and value are not questioned. 

I myself can be long winded, lose my focus, and forgetful. I use a variety of techniques, including a phone planner (S planner on my Samsung 4) to keep track of both urgent and important reminders. I listen before I speak, so that helps me to *think* before I speak as well. Thinking is a time bending tool that allows us to look at at stars while we steer our ship, and not get distracted with the hubbub on deck.

Uhh, europe? you mean the most leftist continent/most leftist group of nations in the world?  your claim appears completely without merit.

&gt;Bolsanaro is threatening to kill people ""suspected"" of drug trafficking and openly admitted to plans of mass genocide.

Hmmm, for some reason I think the above quoted is exaggerated but still, I will look into it.

It sounds a lot like what Rodrigo Duterte did in the Phillipines.... he decided to take an extremely aggressive stance against drug addicts and drug peddlers, it led to a lot of deaths but it did legitimately take care of a terrible problem that plagued his nation. Being in a nation that is plagued by that same problem, I can't say I sympathize with druggies/drug dealers.

Compared to a leftist, dystopian police state like the U.K. which europe seems to favor, I'd say at least Bolsanaro appears to have the best interest of his nation at heart, even if I strongly disagree with his methods.... the U.K. has arrested people for facebook comments, literally dragging them out of their home in the middle of the night, arrested a man for carrying a potato peeler, arrested a man for a comedy video on youtube, arrested a man for practicing journalism, yet won't arrest actual terrorists like returning ISIS fighters....

The U.K. is much worse.

&gt;in the Philippines Duterte is gunning people down in the streets

I think the reason that is happening is important.... the people being gunned down were terrorists and responsible for a great deal of atrocities. I don't agree with Duterte's methods but I simply cannot sympathize with hardcore criminals.

&gt;the left has hardly any power.

Tigers - Ah yes the almost extinct creature that now only is found in Siberia and parts of India?  Only coming back due to OUR help.

Lions - They occupy the savannah and parts of Africa sparsely populated and thus not in our way, yet still hunted by cattle herders in parts of Africa.

Leopards.  Again those found in Africa, not in our way.  The snow leopard in the Hialayas?  Almost exticnt due to poaching.

Komodo Dragons occupy islands that are not inhabited full time by people.

Crocodiles and Alligators are also widely hunted for their skins.  They also occupy a niche area such as swamps, rivers/oceans in Africa, Americas and Australia that dont directly come into contact with a lot of humans.

Polar Bears - Who the hell lives in the Arctic circle for it to matter?

Bears - Wonder why there are no bear or wolf populations in Europe until recently when reintroduced?  We exterminated them all.  Ireland here for example has had any in centuries.

&amp;#x200B;

So as another user has said, we could wipe them out easily but we dont as they dont always directly come into competition with us, however once they do they get killed.

Humans are the most popularly agreed (of course there are other factors) reason for the Holocene extinction of all Megafauna, that is creatures well beyond our physical size.

Let me give you an example. I play ETQW twice a week; its daily peak is 32 players or less most of the times. However, at the evenings of EU and NA regions, it is quite easy to find a full or near full server to play with people. Moreover, the game is no longer digitally available, you need to get a physical copy from Amazon, eBay, etc. to play online. So, despite the fact 30+ people play the game online everyday, should it be called dead game? No, it should not.

[This view of the 70s is a common misconception.](https://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/how-has-inequality-changed) 1979 is the year in which the UK economy was at its most equal. Since then there has been growing inequality. The decline in inequality also began in the 1940s when taxation was at it's most extreme and then slowed and declined in the 1980s when taxation was most reduced. 

&gt;Hollande tried to introduce it in France several years ago and you know how that went down?

That was mainly because of capital flight. The way to address this is greater co-operation with other nations. If all nations had a higher rate of taxation then this would be less of an issue. 

&gt;Zero of the least wealth inequal countries in the world have supertaxes.

It depends on how you define super-taxes. Sweden, a European country with one of the worlds largest Gini coefficients, has a top tax rate of over 60%. There is also an excessive amount of present mindedness in this conversation. If this discussion was had 50 years ago, then most of the worlds wealthiest nations had a very high level of taxation. Just as the economy has changed in the last 50 years it will likely change again in the next 50. There is nothing final about the current state of affairs.

One of the most important and unique features of our brand is attention to detail and the fit of every piece in our collections. Our designers spend hours working on each style, making it look and feel perfect.

Fitted styles make the femininity, fragility and grace of a woman stand out. A calmer, more flared cut does not constrain the movement. Longer coats are made for a more classic look, whereas short jackets give an outfit a sportier feel.

First of all, the sporty style is determined by the length of the jacket - it is short. Designers of the brand tried to combine sports comfort and elegance. In such a sports jacket it is convenient to drive a car, it does not hinder movement and does not create unnecessary volume. This jacket can be worn in combination with the pants Naumi, jeans and even a skirt. As you understand, the sports style does not necessarily require the presence of sneakers or sweatpants.

Whether you are wearing a classic Naumi coat or a sports jacket - one thing will remain the same - femininity and elegance.

(like a slimport or whatever) 

The short answer is:

* Look for Slimport
* Look for compatibility with Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and 9 which also use Slimport
* There are simple USB-C to Slimport adapters (portable, I take this + a HDMI cable on hotel trips for e.g. watching Netflix or my own trip photos)
* There are Slimport compatible hubs that also feature UTP ethernet and USB ports. The advantage over the simple adapter that with most of these, you can charge the V20 while also using e.g. the HDMI connection. So recommended for longer sessions. Mine (Huawei Matedock - I have 3 of them now) need a Power Delivery (PD) adapter/charger to do that. Qualcomm QuickCharge (QC 2.0/3.0) does not charge the V20 through the hub.

The long answer (will take 1-2 hours to read everything) is to follow all the info and links provided in the post and comments here:

2. I think department store brands like Acne and APC are quality brands - but both have a European sensibility. Many of the Los Angeles based department store brands will be focused on certain washes or stretch/comfort properties to sell their jeans, not necessarily denim quality.

Not planned economy, of course, but recently I've read an interview with a major property developer in my country where the property prices have been skyrocketing recently (and it's worse in other parts of Europe), and the government naturally decided something needs to be done about it, their solution was to try to start building subsidized mass housing (think council estates and those nice suburbs in the UK they built after the war).

Well, turns out the government entering the property market to compete against private companies is prohibited by EU competition law! 

And the construction agencies in individual countries are not allowed to treat government housing construction as any different from the private construction, so ""speeding up"" development, ending the construction land speculation where a private company buys land suitable for large-scale construction and then deliberately holds it for as long as price is increasing, then selling it to property developers, which then increases the price of the final product (housing) - most frequently in lucrative parts of cities where plenty of high volume family housing could be built - is also out of the question!

So for now we're stuck with large construction corporations who apparently couldn't care less about the needs of families just making the prices ever higher, forcing everyone to get bigger and bigger mortgages, for a longer period, which again decreases confidence in young people to start families and have more children.

Now, I live in a large city (and have my own housing there so I'm lucky) but would be fine with moving to a more rural area where housing is completely affordable - many young people are choosing that option but most people want to live in reasonable proximity to cities for work etc. and not sacrifice ""active social life"". 

So the consequence is plenty of young people spending their money on renting very expensive (by standards of what the appropriate price should be) properties, usually two bedroom flats, having little security, with their own housing being unaffordable.

De-urbabization is likely the future, but I am convinced that the governments, instead of spending money on nonsense like development aid should invest into housing and compete against private companies - it doesn't directly hurt private property rights, but it also keeps their financial appetites in check because competition and the market works regardless of who is competing - private vs. private or state vs. private.",True,False,False,,0,1541067769,,1541068052,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e8ua5vu,False,t3_9t7usl,False,t1_e8u8who,/r/The_Donald/comments/9t7usl/white_extinction_is_a_myth_but_we_will_replace/e8ua5vu/,,1544860286,5,True,False,The_Donald,t5_38unr,r/The_Donald,public,

Well that is the whole point that it's NOT.

Lenin oversaw colonialism turn into market imperialism, wherein it was not just resources flowing out of a country but the global burgeoise also moved in to exploit the labor and customers of that area.That is imperialism.

But Lenin, nor Stalin, survived to see Financialization which happened after Bretton Woods and basically the Nixon Shock:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_shock

Which rolled in the casino ponzi scheme economy of global debt, financial instruments and stock brokers.

I read somebody, I don't remember who, who described this perfectly that basically the Financialization is what saved Capitalism from it's lack of growth in the 70's and so on.

Capital must constantly innovate itself and make itself more efficient and more overreaching into society in order to survive, which is what Marx described. 

In the Communist Manifesto he talks about how ""traditional values"" have turned into mere money relations.

So we can see how Capitalism commodifies and exploits every aspect of human life. 

The Financialization was the 2nd extension of Capitalism ,because it saved the dwindling profits from industrial capital and the new profits now are almost exlusively made by gambling (most corporations just rebuy their shares, and do phony financial transctions).

-------------------

But the 3rd expansion is into the digital realm in my opinion especially with copyright, which tries to commodify and privatize speech basically. It will carve up the digital realm into corporate fiefdoms where literally, eventually you will have to pay money to say words (that will be the dystopian effect of it). Notice how common English words are already copyrighted and trademarked. It will only get worse.

&gt; ""Intellectual property"" is a coercive attempt by the bourgeoisie to restrict this copying. 

No it's just expansion of capital into the digital realm, and as with any other form of property it is exlusionary. If a word is trademarked, you can't use it, just as if a farm is owned privately, you can't use it.

It is the next stage of capital expansion which will commodify even the very words which we will speak, it will be truly dystopian.

&gt; And you can also see ordinary people routinely disregarding these laws. 

That is irrelevant, just becaue laws can be dodged that doesn't mean that a lot of people won't become victims of it.

Article 13 of the EU effectively will ban links and memes from the internet, and since most people are on 6-7 major websites, if those companies will comply, which they will, we will lose our free speech in Europe basically.

False,redrhyski,1229419194.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_3blek,False,"The National Crime Agency has launched an investigation into Arron Banks and other people and groups linked to the leave campaign over suspected criminal offences in the Brexit referendum, it has announced.


It came after the Electoral Commission said it had referred the cases to the NCA over suspicions that a “number of criminal offences may have been committed”, and that there were reasonable grounds to suspect that Banks, the insurance millionaire who backed the unofficial leave campaign, was not the “true source” of £8m in loans to it.

An Electoral Commission statement said its investigation focused on £2m reported to have been lent to Better for the Country, a company he used to finance the Leave.EU campaign, and £6m more reportedly given to the organisation, on behalf of Leave.EU, by Banks.

Of this money, £2.9m was used to fund referendum spending on behalf of Leave.EU.

The Electoral Commission statement said: “Due to multiple suspected offences, some of which fall outside the commission’s remit, the commission has referred this matter and handed its evidence to the National Crime Agency.”

The NCA confirmed it had begun an investigation connected to “suspected electoral law offences covered by that referral, as well as any associated offences”.

It said in a statement: “While electoral law offences would not routinely fall within the NCA’s remit, the nature of the necessary inquiries and the potential for offences to have been committed other than under electoral law lead us to consider an NCA investigation appropriate in this instance.”

Banks, formerly a major bankroller of Ukip, has denied any wrongdoing. Andy Wigmore, a spokesperson for Leave.EU, said: “It’s completely to be expected. It will finally bring a head to all these crazy allegations made about us. We’re not worried.”



Those referred to the NCA are Banks, Better for the Country, Leave.EU, Elizabeth Bilney – a long-time Banks associate – and what are described as “other associated companies and individuals”.

The investigation centres on the suspicion Banks “was not the true source” of the £8m of loans made to Better for the Country, and that loans involved funds from a “non-qualifying or impermissible company” based in the Isle of Man.

The Electoral Commission statement said the investigation would look into whether Banks, Bilney and others involved in Better for the Country, Leave.EU and associated companies “concealed the true details of these financial transactions”.

Bob Posner, the Electoral Commission’s director of political finance and regulation, said: “We have reasonable grounds to suspect money given to Better for the Country came from impermissible sources and that Mr Banks and Ms Bilney, the responsible person for Leave.EU, knowingly concealed the true circumstances under which this money was provided.

“This is significant because at least £2.9m of this money was used to fund referendum spending and donations during the regulated period of the EU referendum.

“Our investigation has unveiled evidence that suggests criminal offences have been committed which fall beyond the remit of the commission. This is why we have handed our evidence to the NCA to allow them to investigate and take any appropriate law enforcement action. This is now a criminal investigation.

“The financial transactions we have investigated include companies incorporated in Gibraltar and the Isle of Man.

Much of the public is so enamored of the idea of MAD that they don't really see the ways in which the policy can fail nor the fact that several nuclear powers no longer believe it to be a core philosophy of nuclear doctrine.

Russia for instance has long since adopted the idea of ""Escalate to Deescalate"". The idea being that they know that any protracted conflict with NATO or really any near or peer level power eventually shifts against them due to logistical and technical challenges. In response to this they have developed a doctrine of limited scope in theater nuclear strikes designed to *force* a diplomatic crisis.

They believe that in such a scenario that western powers will freeze momentarily due to fear of nuclear escalation. Thus buying them a brief window in which they can sue for negotiations, ones that will likely be acquiesced to in order to reduce the risk of catastrophic escalation. 

The have become so enamored of this idea that limited use scope nuclear strikes to force compliance have become ingrained in all levels of their strategic thinking both offensively and defensively, across a broad array of scenarios.

These developments have played a large part in influencing U.S. policy in regards to placing missile defense systems in eastern Europe as well as abandoning the INF treaty. 

Missile defense systems are not currently a realistic deterrent to a full scale nuclear exchange, how ever they could certainly be problematic for someone trying to use very limited scope short to moderate range nuclear weapons, particularity given that they would be most likely to be used geographically near to such systems. Thus Russian frustration with the idea of U.S. missile defense systems in Europe, it undercuts a key portion of their doctrine and potentially limits them to conventional conflict which for a multitude of reasons is a losing proposition for them in the long run. 

As regards to the INF treaty, Russia has long abandoned it in pursuit of intermediate and short range, low to moderate yield nuclear weapons. Part of the reason their ""Escalate to Deescalate"" policy makes sense is that for many years the U.S. has had only limited options to respond in kind to such a strike, as our nuclear policy is centered around deterring a large scale exchange. Meaning that we would be more likely to negotiate than respond with a disproportionately large reprisal risking full blown nuclear conflict.

If I didn't manage to catch your angle please give me a heads up. As a disclaimer, I'm German and this is certain to effect my point of view on this topic.

Economically, the EU is between a rock and a hard place. Brexit is going to cost any way. Either one applies the same rules one does to any third country - and thus causing the consequences you mentioned - or one finds an extra accommodating solution. However in doing so one obsoletes the economical part of the EU as the member countries themselves would not see the point in carrying the costs or adhering to the rules of these shared institutions if it is demonstrated, that the benefits can be reaped even without. As such, these institutions would collapse, and that what UK is asking for won't exist in the first place, not to mention the gargantuan loss in both capital and jobs that comes from the collapse of the shared supply infrastructure. Once factoring this in the clear line against UK actually is the one with the lowest losses associated to the EU.


Politically, Barnier is executing the will of the EU27. As such it is his task to try to match any UK proposal against the rule book given to him by the 27. He thus doesn't have the option to be more accommodating than he is at the moment, even if - and I personally doubt it - he personally would be willing to do so. Remember that any deal has to be agreed to by the 27 and not Barnier. 

Additionally, the EU never was a primarily economic union in the first place. The foremost role of it is as a guarantor of peace and democracy on the continent. While certainly not limited to this, this role was an important factor when deciding on expanding the EU to include ex military dictatorships such as Greece - that it wasn't fit economy wise was something that has been discussed at that time already, if you care to search older archives.

Establishing a precedent in taking a pick and thus disassembling the common rules and freedoms would allow other EU states, which if you look east are partially already trying to do so, to justify deriving from the framework that has been established and held true in an attempt to pacify a continent that historically was very used to violence. If you look back the past or so millennium you'll find that the EU is representing one of the longest periods of relative peace there ever was. The UK frankly is not worth it to risk it.

Aproveitando para corrigir a minha hipocrisia inicial, vou também dar-me os parabéns a mim próprio, porque a nossa situação é idêntica nas coisas que mencionaste (pais que pagaram as despesas, e se passasse da ""validade"" era eu que pagava).

Quando digo reality check, era com o intuito de inferir a quantidade (que não é pouca de certeza) de gente com, suponhamos, a média igual ou superior que tu (ou que eu) que não tiveram a hipótese de escolher o teu curso, e o que isso nos beneficia na colocação onde quer que tenhamos entrado. Muitas das médias dos cursos que por aí andam só não são mais altas porque, assim estimado a olho, 1/3 do pessoal que podia tirar um curso tem que entrar no mercado forçosamente aos 18 por razões financeiras, e outro 1/3 por razões sociais (porque escolheram mal no 10º, porque o único curso que queriam não dá, porque seguem negócio da família, porque os pais não vêm benefício no ensino superior, porque os pais emigram...). Era só isso.

Sobre a classe média: Estava a referir-me à classe média na faixa 45-70 anos, ou seja, os pais. Essa não faz ninguém emigrar porque numa situação ideal (e para ideal, vou referenciar tema de discórdia - o sector público) vão tendo redução de horário, vão criando empresas (e emprego) e/ou vão-se reformando. O dinheiro e o trabalho disponível vão sendo libertados duma maneira ou doutra. O problema é ter classe média recém-graduada à espera de salários iguais aos dos pais, e para isso fazerem coisas como exigir acima da média ou criar startups sem nexo para chularem os seus colegas de curso. Não há mais bolsas de mérito porque o estado prefere compensar o excesso de procura com uma barreira económica, do que restringir (ainda mais) o numerus clausus. É um pouco como aumentar os impostos da viatura privada (IUC, IA, combustíveis), em vez de melhorar as condições de transportes públicos e alternativos.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Mas é a classe média que mete os filhos em privadas? Julgava que fosse a alta. E haver mais privadas acabava com ""tanta banalidade com ensino superior concluído""? Julgava que vinham mais banalidades do privado do que do público...

""Olhe que não"". Cada vez há mais filhos da classe média a ocupar as privadas. E sim, veêm mais banalidades das privadas, mas também há, estranhamente, algumas excepções, como também há bons médicos formados na UBI ou bons engenheiros formados num politécnico de Cucujões. E no tema dos politécnicos, cada vez há mais nas cidades pequenas, e estão-se a tornar na nova forma de explorar recém licenciados (caso de Portalegre, Fundão, Viseu, Beja, onde estão a aparecer pólos tecnológicos para dar vazão aos engenheiros, TOCs e designers no desemprego).

Sobre o numerus clausus de medicina, é claramente diferente dos outros numerus clausus. Os limites de vagas em medicina só existem por causa da ordem deles, já os outros existem porque, em muitos casos, têm de ter, mas também porque há certas universidades mais prestigiadas ou desejadas geograficamente. Ainda é raro ver um curso que não seja medicina ou uma engenharia no Técnico, FEUP, Braga que preencha tudo na 1ª fase.

False,Gunnar_Grautnes,1520251986.0,,,[],,4∆,dark,text,t2_kgtfshc,False,"I think there are two main lines of argument against this position, namely appeals to enlightened self-interest and appeals to moral duty.

Appeals to moral duty, in one way or another, point to the duties that we as humans, and, by extension, aggregates of humans such as states, have towards each other. It may well be that we have a primary duty towards some group, family say, and that states likewise have a primary duty towards its own citizens. It is compatible with this to say that states have a duty to help citizens of foreign countries even if they haven't solved all of their internal issues. If you look at the kind of issues which foreign aid usually or at least ostensibly is intended to avail, these issues are a lot more serious than the internal issues of most rich countries. It may well be that a state's pensioners receive insufficient care, or that parts of its infrastructure is in need of repair, or that its educational system is underfunded. Nevertheless, these issues pale in comparison with food shortages threatening to kill millions, or the millions dying of preventable diseases at a young age around the world. Often, in discussing our duties towards the global sufferers, Singer's example of passing by a drowning child is brought up. In this case, we might consider a father whose primary duty is towards his child, who, on his way home to his child's birthday, passes by a drowning child. Surely the duty of the father to save this child takes precedence over his duty to be home in time for his child's birthday, even if the latter forms part of his primary duties. It is not unreasonable to think that something like this holds for states also.

We often think that we have particular duties towards those we have harmed. Through wars, colonialism, pollution, and myriads of ways of ongoing exploitation, most rich countries have contributed to most poor countries being poor, and been a cause behind the issues these countries face. It is not unreasonable to think that most rich states therefore have particular duties towards most poor states. 

Appeals to enlightened self-interest point to the ways in which global issues also tend to birth internal issues, and how foreign aid can be an efficient way to tackle these issues. One might think of how the civil war in Syria has led to a wave of refugees to Europe, or how bad healthcare systems in poor countries can give rise to pandemics which threaten rich countries equally, or how poverty in the Amazon makes chopping down the rainforest more attractive, thus contributing to climate change. To the extent that foreign aid helps reduce these issues, it is also a way to combat internal issues. It may even prove to be a cost-efficient one, given the right implementation.

There's also the kind of self-interest where the 'enlightened'-label sits somewhat awkwardly: That of geopolitical influence. [This is a major motivation behind much of US foreign aid.](https://www.ft.com/content/14400aa2-c743-11e8-ba8f-ee390057b8c9) Countries like Pakistan are paid for their continued support for US foreign policy aims, under the guise of foreign aid. Thus, one should keep in mind that the foreign aid budgets one criticizes typically aren't all devoted to helping solve issues in foreign countries.

Both of these lines of argument leave plenty of room for criticism of the particular ways in which foreign aid is currently being employed with regards to efficiency, corruption, impact on local economies, and so on.",True,False,False,,0,1541082215,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e8ulpbo,False,t3_9t9k5p,True,t3_9t9k5p,/r/changemyview/comments/9t9k5p/cmv_countries_must_solve_its_internal_issues/e8ulpbo/,,1544865676,1,True,False,changemyview,t5_2w2s8,r/changemyview,public,

False,incendiaryblizzard,1465518787.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_yli62,False,"&gt;Indeed. The ""Oslo process"" as you call it began in the early 1990s. The settlement project began in the late 1960s. Construction of the settlements, some thought, would put pressure on the Palestinian side to make peace with Israel because the longer they waited to make peace, the more settlements would be constructed. Instead, the settlements were used as a ""stealing land"" brick in the victim narrative.

This is ahistorical. The settlements were never ever intended to put pressure on the Palestinians to reach a peace deal. They were always intended to 'steal land'. You are rewriting history. You can read what the settlers themselves said. You can read what Netanyahu said about this throughout this period. Its about Jews returning to their ancient home, to the the heart of Israel, the west bank. Its not about pushing for a two state solution and never was. You made this up. 

&gt;The comparison is apt. Like the Germans, the Palestinians launched a war with the goal of taking over a neighboring state, and like the Germans, they were utterly defeated and occupied. But unlike the Germans, they refuse to admit defeat and have instead spun history to make themselves into the victims. 

The Palestinians were not a 'neighbouring state'. Half of the population of the state of Israel (which was created the war started) was Palestinian. They were fighting for their own state, not to take a neighbouring state. And the Palestinians did admit defeat. Thats why they recognized Israel. Thats why they agreed to a state on 22% of mandatory Palestine. Thats called admitting defeat.

&gt;Imagine if the Nazis had done that and the fighting continued until this day. What a terrible place Europe would have been.

The Germans would have absolutely continued fighting if France decided that it would colonize Germany for generations and prevent the Germans from having a state or citizenship in any state. 

&gt;This is not only not true, but a very defeatist and thought terminating idea. Of course Israel wants peace, so does Palestine, they just both want it on their own terms. Demonization of one side does not help anyone. Netanyahu has said multiple times he wants a two state solution of a Jewish state alongside a Palestinian state. It's against the spirit of this sub entirely to claim one side or another 'doesn't want peace.'

Netanyahu says that he wants a state-minus for the Palestinians and at least 40 years of Israeli control over the Palestinian territories. Of course everyone wants peace, but they have other priorities first. The Americans fighting for independence also wanted peace, but independence was a priority and they would rather die than not have it. Its not demonization to say that someone has a priority other than peace. The Palestinians also have priorities that come before peace, for example independence and rights. Likud and Jewish home have the priority to settle the ancient jewish homeland of judea and samaria and all their actions have been to achieve that goal. Bennet wants peace but only in the situation where the Palestinians live in small autonomous zones under Israeli military control and where israelis can settle land around them freely. thats not demonization, thats literally his expressed objective.",True,False,False,,0,1541083854,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e8uniqu,False,t3_9t917c,False,t1_e8ulp3b,/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/9t917c/how_conflicts_end_and_what_makes_israelpalestine/e8uniqu/,,1544866512,9,True,False,IsraelPalestine,t5_2sgz7,r/IsraelPalestine,public,

&gt; Barnier must represent the EU27 and therefore has no flexibility.

Yup, the EU is a massive, monolithic, inflexible (and expensive) government that, by trying to satisfy the needs of everyone satisfies the needs of none. There would have been no referendum and no Brexit if the EU had had just a little bit of flexibility when David Cameron went and begged for changes and the EU said no. 

It's not an organisation I want to be a part of that can only keep members by punishing the ones that try to leave - kind of like the mafia. Agree that there will be massive cost on both sides - that is the point I made in my reply to the OP.

&gt;Additionally, the EU never was a primarily economic union in the first place. The foremost role of it is as a guarantor of peace and democracy on the continent. 

Strongly don't agree. The original inception of the EU was as the European *Economic* Community (EEC). It was supposed to be a trade zone. 

This is what the Brexiters feel strongly about: a massive, undemocratic government and court in Brussels that overrides the national policy of its members on everything from fisheries and agricultural policy, human rights and immigration. 

And it's a government that has stated its goal for ever increasing and centralised power: it's own currency, taxation policy, ever increasing powers for its courts; its own army for Christ's sake.

The lefties in the UK (of which I used to be one) like the EU because it is (supposedly) left wing. But, with the TTIP, policies toward Greece etc., the EU is increasingly neo-liberal and controlled by corporate interests. The point is that an undemocratic government is still undemocratic.

Complicating the decision is a recent attempt, allegedly sanctioned by Iranian government officials, to assassinate an Iranian dissident living in Denmark. The dissident was a branch leader of a movement in Iran known as the Arab separatist movement, or ASMLA. 

This article mentions the irony of Iran responding so harshly to the Khashoggi killing, rhetoric that will surely be used against them by Saudi Arabia and Israel as they're backing the sanctions against Iran.

&gt; Those various off-white groups, Jews, the Irish, Italians, Eastern  Europeans, etc. were whitened over time through the necessities of  anti-blackness. 

Jews are a genetically distinct population and usually identify as not white, so based on those two things I don't think they are white. Irish, Italians, and Eastern Europeans all are closely genetically clustered. Considering Europeans white doesn't necessarily have anything to do with ""anti-blackness"" and has never had that *denotation*. Maybe in some specific areas at some specific time periods it was used that way by some specific people (i.e. had that *connotation)*, but ""White"" and ""Black"" and ""Asian"" etc. are still used in the common parlance and no longer have those connotations.

&gt; The reason whiteness differs from blackness is because of this power relation 

Again, maybe in 1650, but not today. Someone can be proud of being white and have absolutely no thoughts on way or the other about ""blackness"" or non-whites. 

&gt;So having pride in being black stems from  having constructed a culture and an identity in the face of a  commodification system (Slavery) that worked overtime trying to ensure  that you didn't.  Blackness was imposed upon African people who had  their own cultural roots upturned, destroyed, oppressed, and controlled.  
&gt;  
&gt;Celebrating  black pride means you celelbrate the survival of something despite the  rape, pillage, murder, and enslavement of a continent.

Ridiculous just-so story with no evidence that is also factually questionable and misleading. Rewrite history all you want, doesn't make it true.

&gt; Celebrating white pride means you celebrate something made to justify  and defend the rape, pillage, murder and enslavement of a continent. 

This is laughable. White pride has to do with the history, culture, ancestry, etc. of whites, such as creating civilization as we know it and inventing 90% of technologies throughout most of history. I don't speak for everyone but neither do you, it's absurd to say that people who are proud of their White heritage are so because they are celebrating one end of some perceived dichotomy with Africa. 

If someone celebrates Arabic pride, is this also the case, since their slave trade was much bigger and they were generally much more cruel and brutal to their slaves? Oh wait, no, it's not, because they're not white so you'll come up with some story about how it's OK for them to be proud of their ethnicity as well. Rinse and repeat for every group except whites. Throughout history, every group of humans has done things to other groups that we now view as terrible. When you say that Whites can't be proud of who they are *today* because of *historical* cruelty from whites towards other groups, it's clear that you are either historically ignorant of the injustices committed within and among every group on Earth, or (more likely in my opinion) you're anti-White.",True,False,False,,0,1541088944,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e8uti5e,False,t3_9sydxy,True,t1_e8uf0zz,/r/forwardsfromgrandma/comments/9sydxy/fwd_from_grandpa_courtesy_of_my_daughter_my/e8uti5e/,,1544869316,-1,True,False,forwardsfromgrandma,t5_2t776,r/forwardsfromgrandma,public,

 SÃO PAULO (Reuters) - O juiz federal Sérgio Moro, responsável pela primeira condenação do ex-presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, deixará o posto de principal estrela da Lava Jato ao assumir o comando do Ministério da Justiça no governo do presidente eleito Jair Bolsonaro, em uma decisão que dará fôlego a críticos que apontam viés político em sua atuação como magistrado.

  Juiz Sérgio Moro 24/10/2018 REUTERS/Paulo Whitaker

 Moro, de 46 anos, já foi celebrado como herói —inclusive em montagens em que aparece como super-homem e sigla “SM” no peito—, e apontado por parcela significativa da população como ícone do combate à corrupção.

 Um estudioso da Operação Mãos Limpas, que combateu a corrupção na Itália na década de 1990, Moro fez comparações entre a operação italiana e a Lava Jato e, além de sua atuação no caso como juiz, também defendeu mudanças estruturais, incluindo no sistema político, para combater a corrupção.

 Apontado como possível nome para disputar o Palácio do Planalto neste ano, chegou a ter o nome incluído em pesquisas de intenção de voto antes de definidas as candidaturas, negou a possibilidade de entrar na vida política, alegando ter feito uma “opção pela magistratura”.

 “Eu fiz uma opção na minha carreira pela magistratura então não me vejo, e já disse mais de uma vez, e reitero quantas vezes forem necessárias, que não serei candidato, nada disso”, afirmou durante evento em 2017 em São Paulo.

 Ao aceitar o convite de Bolsonaro, no entanto, deixará a magistratura para trás, ao menos por ora, já que o presidente eleito também o apontou como provável indicado a uma vaga no Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF) quando uma das cadeiras ficar vaga, o que deve ocorrer em 2020, com a aposentadoria compulsória do ministro Celso de Mello.

 Especializado em crimes financeiros, Moro foi juiz do caso Banestado no início dos anos 2000, quando o doleiro Alberto Youssef, envolvido na Lava Jato, também foi um dos protagonistas e um dos que firmaram acordo de delação premiada com a Justiça.

 Antes de ganhar notoriedade nacional com a Lava Jato, Moro foi juiz auxiliar da ministra Rosa Weber, do STF, em 2012, durante o julgamento do caso conhecido como mensalão, numa época em que Rosa havia recém chegado ao Supremo oriunda da Justiça do Trabalho.

 Como juiz da Lava Jato, Moro teve embates frequentes durante audiências com a defesa de Lula, que por diversas vezes questionou juridicamente a suposta parcialidade do juiz.

 Em um dos casos, após encerrada a audiência com o zelador do prédio onde fica o tríplex atribuído a Lula, que depôs como testemunha no processo, Moro ironizou o fato de Lula ter processado o procurador da República Deltan Dallagnol, chefe da força-tarefa da Lava Jato em Curitiba, por conta de uma apresentação em power point em que acusou o petista de chefe de organização criminosa, indagando se a defesa processaria a testemunha.

 “Vai entrar com ação de indenização então contra ela (testemunha), doutor?”, perguntou ao advogado Cristiano Zanin Martins, que representa Lula.

 Zanin rebateu que ninguém estava acima da lei e indagou se |Moro estava advogando para o zelador. O juiz respondeu de forma sarcástica.

 “Está bom, doutor. Uma linha de advocacia muito boa”, ironizou. Ao que advogado de Lula respondeu também irônico: “Faço o registro de vossa excelência e recebo como um elogio.”

 O juiz foi alvo de críticas por conta do episódio em que divulgou nos autos do processo interceptações telefônicas de Lula com a então presidente Dilma Rousseff, e com outras autoridades com prerrogativa de foro, como o então ministro Jaques Wagner e o governador do Piauí, Wellington Dias, ação que contribuiu para a desestabilização da petista.

 Também foi novamente acusado de viés político quando tornou públicos trechos da delação premiada do ex-ministro Antonio Paloci a poucos dias do primeiro turno da eleição presidencial. Antes, o magistrado havia adiado o depoimento de Lula no processo do sítio de Atibaia para novembro, sob alegação de que o adiamento visava evitar exploração eleitoral.

 O papel central na Lava Jato também rendeu a Moro fama internacional. Ele foi condecorado por universidades estrangeiras, deu palestras no exterior e estampou capas de revistas internacionais, aclamado como um símbolo do combate à corrupção e ao fim da impunidade de poderosos no Brasil.

 Moro é casado com a advogada Rosangela Wolff Moro, criadora de uma página no Facebook em homenagem ao marido intitulada “Eu Moro com ele” e que comemorou a vitória de Bolsonaro no segundo turno das eleições presidenciais nas redes sociais. O casal tem dois filhos.

If all people got vaccinated, many illnesses would be extinct by now because a virus can't spread if there aren't enough ""hosts"".

&gt;It will probably be harder to get a visa when you don't have a related degree or work experience. Tech salaries are also much lower in Asia and Europe than they are in the US. Even Singapore tech salaries are considerably below US levels. It's probably better to get some experience in Silicon Valley if you end up pursuing a tech career. The tech sector in China is booming even more than the US, but it will difficult if you don't know the language.


Silicon Valley is closing up for those who aren't the absolute top talent. Despite there being dozens of companies coming out of incubators like YComb and others, the fact is these days if you aren't coming out of a top school it feels from the outside looking in absolutely impossible to find a job in the Valley. There's that, and the fact that personally I don't want to live there; it's too car centric and I can't drive.


&gt;Why not just work remotely from Asia? That's what I do. Even in mainland China, it's pretty easy to turn on the VPN and do the same programming work I do in the US. The timezone is a bit more annoying for working with the US, but that gets you the experience in Asia you want. You can also get a part time English teaching job in Asia, and use your extra free time to work on your remote programming work.


I'll definitely keep that idea in the front of my mind. Nominally the reasons I chose the Balkans were because of an easier time difference as well as the absence of lung-destroying pollution. Taiwan or Korea though would be very nice. Korea and Japan are high on my radar but I'm unsure of how I'd go about obtaining clients/local work without knowing the language to near fluency. English teaching in both places seems to be the preferred route to go despite wages being stagnant.

&amp;#x200B;

Tak!

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Lets start with the economy. Germany is the main market for Danish exports: Going off what i remember, we export goods total 58% of the Danish GDP, and Germany is by far the largest export market for us. So a lot of the economy is geared towards Germany - in that regard, Denmark is basically a northern extension of Germany, and in this regard we interact a lot. Far more than with Norway or Sweden, in fact.

&amp;#x200B;

Makes sense.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Then we have tourism: Every summer, countless Germans overrun Denmark (kinda like WW2 but this time with friendly intentions). Once again, they are number one in interaction in this regard. In fact, much [Danish tourist information](http://visitfanoe.dk/da/home/)(especially outside the big cities, such as this small island whose summertime population is more than doubled due to German tourists) has German before English - and a lot of the Danes working in German-favorited areas or close to the German border, speak passable German. Our main draw for the Germans tends to be nature, specifically beaches - we have more than double the coastline of Germany, and since most is within easy driving distance and not at all crowded, its an obvious destination for Germans.

This is mainly a personal observation, but i also think the Germans value the fact that Denmark is a fairly well-run country, just like their native Germany. Not a lot of south-european laissez-faire who-cares-if-youre-late here, but still a more down-to-earth and informal atmosphere than Germany.

&amp;#x200B;

I see.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Bottom line, your impression that Germany has closer interaction with their ""continental"" neighbours is correct, though. A lot of this is geography: We do share a border, yes, but most of the Danish population is actually quite far from the German border - unlike fx NL or CH, where the population centers are almost integrated with each other. The majority of Danes live on the islands, and that does indeed limit how close Germany feels - Sweden might be a quicker drive, even though the only land border is with Germany.

&amp;#x200B;

Makes sense.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Hope this answered your question, feel free to ask if theres more! Always nice to have foreign visitors on the sub.

&amp;#x200B;

It did. And I'll probably check in this sub occasionally to pose more questions in the near future in case I need to know something about Denmark again!

 O ex-árbitro de futebol Gutemberg de Paula Fonseca, que trabalhou na campanha de Wilson Witzel (PSC) para o Governo do Rio de Janeiro - Rafael Andrade - 10.jan.2012/Folhapress A estratégia digital que ajudou o ex-juiz [Wilson Witzel](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/10/ex-juiz-federal-witzel-derrota-paes-e-e-eleito-governador-do-rio-de-janeiro-projeta-datafolha.shtml) (PSC) a se tornar governador do Rio de Janeiro tem por trás outro ex-juiz que nunca usou uma toga.

 O coordenador da campanha digital do candidato, [Gutemberg de Paula Fonseca](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/esporte/19939-gutemberg-mostra-internet-como-prova.shtml), foi árbitro de futebol até 2012, quando abandonou o apito acusando o chefe da Comissão de Arbitragem da CBF (Confederação Brasileira de Futebol), Sérgio Corrêa, de manipular escalas dos juízes e sugerir ajuda ao Corinthians numa partida. O caso foi arquivado na Justiça Desportiva por falta de provas.

 Guto, como é chamado, foi incorporado à equipe do ex-juiz a 20 dias do primeiro turno. Foi o responsável por intensificar a campanha nas plataformas digitais —entre elas redes sociais— a fim de explorar a associação de Witzel com bandeiras do presidenciável Jair Bolsonaro (PSL).

 O candidato do PSC que aparecia num quarto pelotão de candidatos nas pesquisas de intenção de voto [deu uma arrancada na reta final](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/10/ex-juiz-witzel-ameaca-continuismo-de-20-anos-nas-eleicoes-do-rio-de-janeiro.shtml) do primeiro turno e obteve 41,28% dos votos válidos. No segundo, venceu a disputa com o ex-prefeito Eduardo Paes (DEM) com 59,87% dos votos válidos.

 ""Uma das estratégias foi mostrar que ele é da ideologia que o povo busca hoje: família, bons costumes. Ele foi militar, o Jair também. Ele é contra a criminalidade, o Jair também. Tivemos que levar essa informação [ao eleitor]"", afirmou ele.

 Uma das estratégias foi pagar anúncios no Google indicando o site de Witzel a usuários que fizessem buscas com o termo ""Bolsonaro"".

 De 2007 até janeiro de 2012, Guto acumulava funções públicas, tocava sua agência de publicidade e apitava jogos pelo país. Foi quando, após ser retirado do quadro da Fifa, atacou o presidente da Comissão Nacional de Arbitragem da CBF.

 Ele acusou Corrêa de corrupção. Disse que ele pediu, de forma indireta, favorecimento ao Corinthians num jogo do Brasileiro de 2010, e que sua exclusão da Fifa fora uma perseguição motivada pelas críticas que fazia ao comando da arbitragem nacional.

 As denúncias de influência nas arbitragens não se confirmaram. O Superior Tribunal de Justiça Desportiva as considerou ""desprovidas de veracidade e lógica"". Oito meses depois, ele pediu desculpas numa audiência judicial.

 ""No dia da audiência, o Edson Rezende [ex-presidente da comissão] pediu para acabar com isso. 'Deixa isso para lá, vamos seguir a vida'. E eu tenho admiração e respeito por ele. Atendi, pedi desculpas e paguei uma cesta básica"", disse ele, que reafirma a perseguição sofrida.

 Dez anos antes Guto já havia criado sua agência Yxe. Em 2002, atuou na campanha do coronel Heitor José de Souza, do antigo PFL, que acabou não eleito.

 Nos anos posteriores, ocupou cargos no estado na gestão Sérgio Cabral (MDB) em pastas destinadas ao PSC. Foi secretário municipal em Japeri, na Baixada Fluminense, e chefe de gabinete do vereador Fernando Moraes, à época no PR, que se tornou seu último contato com o poder público.

 Guto se aproximou da família Bolsonaro em 2017 por meio do deputado estadual eleito [Rodrigo Amorim](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/10/candidato-que-quebrou-placa-em-homenagem-a-marielle-e-o-mais-votado-para-alerj.shtml) (PSL), amigo de longa data.

 Após a eleição de 2016, em que Amorim foi candidato a vice-prefeito na chapa encabeçada por Flávio Bolsonaro (PSL), foi procurado para ajudar como voluntário na comunicação e imagem do grupo com vistas a esta eleição.

 Neste pleito, estava focado na campanha de Amorim e auxiliava a do senador eleito Flávio. A 20 dias da votação do primeiro turno, foi chamado a integrar a equipe do ex-juiz.

 Paes tentou explorar no segundo turno o fato de Witzel ser pouco conhecido do eleitorado, apesar dos 3,1 milhões de votos que havia obtido. Comparou o adversário ao prefeito Marcelo Crivella (PRB), mal avaliado, apontando a necessidade de experiência para governar o estado.

 ""Esse foi o grande erro dele. O Paes bateu numa tecla que refletia nele. Se fosse uma outra figura, poderia dar certo. O problema é que existem muitos percalços que o Eduardo atravessou que a população naturalmente buscou"", afirmou Guto.

 ""Nessa eleição, quem deu o cartão vermelho foi o eleitor"", disse o ex-árbitro.

For reference, I just started my treatment (day 3, 37 trays, switching every 5 days). Here's what my orthodontist told me: Since the treatment is relatively hands off from an orthodontic perspective (especially 4-6 months in), then it shouldn't be a problem provided you're able to return now and then for check-ups and any additional treatments. In my case, I have family here, so I'd likely be coming back a few times anyway, so I'll just align those visits with my treatment dates. I will also do check-ups via Skype so they can get a sense of how I'm managing and how things are moving. If you don't plan on coming back, that probably changes your options.

I live in the Pacific Northwest and, apparently, treatment like this is not uncommon here. My orthodontist will do Invisalign for fishermen who will be up in Alaska or out-to-sea for extended periods.

Nike at this point isn't even a clothier in my opinion, but more of a supply chain management corporation that happens to make apparel ;) It's really expensive to put stuff together, but what people don't get is that it's better to buy a $300 jacket that's going to last through 3-5 winters than a new $30 hoodie that's going to have to be replaced each season. 

But you're going up against the forces of fast fashion here. People are used to getting stuff on the cheap and getting it fast, but those people aren't going to be your customer. Your customer is going to be someone that understands that the good stuff costs a little more and they're going to be willing to wait a little longer to get it.

The advice I can give you is to acquaint yourself with the differences between Asian cuts and European cuts. You're a bigger guy so you've probably run into what my husband lovingly calls the ""Danny DeVito Problem"". Clothing cut to Asian specifications are made for people with short torsos (and short legs, just short everything which is great for me but horrible for him), so when they size up the cut gets wider but the garment stays short. If you've ever bought something from Europe you've probably noticed that the garment runs long to fit a longer torso, and the arms are longer too! But European cuts can be a bit slim so you're going to have some troubleshooting ahead of you. If you ever get to a point with outsourcing labor make sure you keep an eye on this though, I've seen so many problems with cuts and it can make or break your business.

That's not a valid conclusion, since they could be religious/atheist, have learning disabilities or not, be able-bodied or not, come from broken homes or not, have worked on the side or not, be LGBT or not, be QIA+ or not, etc. Assuming you mean racially diverse, the replacement group might nonetheless happen to be more similar on the whole if their lived experiences are more similar.

There is no proof that whites are a homogenous group, like there is no indication that blondes are, blacks are, or autistic paraplegic latino transwoman lesbians are. It's therefore impossible to prove that racial (or similar) diversification always creates more diverse ideas than diversification based on age, social class, job experience, etc. Claiming that shared traits for population groups based on immutable characteristics outnumber the differences between any two individuals is one or several of bigotry, magical thinking, bias of low expectations, sexism, racism, etc.

&gt;  It's also safe to assume that an algorithm that tagged pictures of black people as gorillas would have been less likely to be released to the general public if it had been worked on by black engineers.

Probably, but it would depend on other factors like QA processes, the amount of inspection done on the algorithm's classifications and the amount of fine-tuning done. I don't know enough about that particular case to decide resoundingly.

&gt; Cool, have you heard of the replication crisis? Turns out it exists in the hard sciences as well.

Whataboutism. The campaign by James Lindsay, Peter Boghossian and Helen Pluckrose I linked shows serious problems with the entire fields of sociology and gender/sex/women's/queer/X studies, which happen to be the ones leading the debate on ""social justice"".

&gt; Undoubtedly a diverse group of people who all went to an Ivy League school will still have had a different experience to a bunch of white guys who went to Ivy League school. 

Diverse does not mean ""not cis-man white hetero"", period.

&gt; The white guys will never have had to experience racism or sexism, for a start.

Words like racism and sexism don't care what race or sex you have. Claiming otherwise is nonsense and ideologically based, as well as ignorant of American history. Racism against Italians and the Irish is well-documented. In a European context, so is the persecution of Jews and Roma (both white). When it comes to sexism, ask men working in nurseries and nursing or going through custody battles or false allegations of domestic abuse. It's not because different groups don't experience discrimination in equal amounts that the least discriminated against suffer none.

Humans are individuals and the cumulative sum of their biology and experiences. Making a value judgement based on just one aspect is oversimplification and bigotry - specialised in racism or sexism as it might be. It's odd that has to be explained nowadays.

Title: **eBay refusing to delete my account**

Original Post: 

&gt; I received an email informing me my account was suspended, but couldn't provide any details, but I would, in the form of driving license bank statement and and utility bills. I called them to clarify as I assumed this was a scam, but, it was in fact correct! so after explaining to them, I would be unable to provide these details (because I don't trust eBay not because I don't have them). I asked them to delete my account, to which I was told we can't do that!!! 
&gt; 
&gt; I was under the impression that EU dictates that when a customer asked for his/her account and details to be permanently deleted they have to by law confirm. 
&gt; 
&gt; I am basically asking if I would be able to go to court to have my account and details removed as they are refusing to do so otherwise. 
&gt; 
&gt; thanks in advance

False,blackmagic70,1263863341.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_3u0to,False,"Aweakness of Brexiteers has been failing to spell out a clear alternative to membership of the European Union. One such option is Norway’s model, outside the eu but inside its single market. Both the government and Parliament have rejected the idea of joining Norway in the European Economic Area (eea). But it has been revived in a new form by Nick Boles, a Tory mp. His “Norway for now” plan is backed by fellow Tories like Nicky Morgan and Labour mps such as Frank Field.

The benefits of the eea lie in keeping the single market but escaping the eu’s farm and fisheries policies and the direct jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. The drawbacks are becoming a rule-taker in that market and accepting free movement of people from the eu, as well as paying into its budget. eea countries can strike third-country trade deals, but as they are not in a customs union with the eu, membership does not by itself remove the need for border controls, which Britain has promised to avoid in Northern Ireland.

Mr Boles is clear that his plan works only if Parliament rejects a Brexit deal put to it by Theresa May. But he puts the probability of the prime minister’s deal failing as high as 50%. And he does not see a parliamentary majority emerging for a second referendum, which Mrs May is firmly against. For all sides, he says, Norway for now would surely be preferable to a no-deal Brexit. He has also changed his original idea of fixing a three-year time limit in the eea before moving towards a Canada-style free-trade deal. Now he talks merely of “temporary” membership while some alternative is negotiated.

His idea faces formidable practical and legal obstacles. Businesses would not welcome having to adapt twice to Brexit. Switching horses this late in the negotiations would be awkward. Brexit is less than 150 days away, but to join the eea requires accession to the European Free Trade Association (efta), a process that could take months or years. Mr Boles reckons there are ways round this, but concedes that his plan may also require a transition. That would only add to the uncertainties facing business.

Temporary membership of the eea would be hard to sell to others. The eea countries have said they would welcome Britain as a permanent member. But as Erna Solberg, Norway’s prime minister, put it diplomatically when she met Mrs May in Oslo this week, joining with the declared intention of leaving a few years later would be “a little bit difficult” for other members.

Then there is the Irish border. efta/eea membership may make it legally hard to be in a customs union with the eu. And that may make it impossible to drop the Northern-Ireland-only backstop that Mrs May is resisting in the Brexit withdrawal deal. Mr Boles suggests that some form of associate membership of the eea could allow the creation of a temporary customs union with the eu, but many in Brussels disagree.

Last is the issue of free movement of people. eea and efta members must accept this as a principle, a big reason why Brexiteers oppose their model. Continued free movement is an argument for doubting if the Norway model is sustainable for Britain in the long run. Yet there are ways to limit free movement, and net migration from eu countries has also fallen sharply since 2016.

Norway for now is under attack from ardent Leavers and Remainers alike. But that could make it a compromise. For all its problems, it would be foolish to rule it out amid the chaos of a parliamentary rejection of a Brexit deal this winter.

You will hear some newer stuff on the radio and Pandora, Spotify, whatever, but sometimes to hear that new Christmas stuff you need to go out and buy Christmas CDs/albums by specific artists. 

Another commenter mentioned that these songs can suck--that's absolutely true. I've heard a few that were really good. Weird Al has done some great ones, with original lyrics, not original music. A lot of it is awful though. We're talking like maybe one or two good songs on an entire album that you paid for. 

John Lennon's Happy Xmas War is Over is an example of a Christmas song that is quite a bit newer(20-ish years or more) than a lot of the Christmas music you traditionally hear on the radio and nothing like traditional Christmas music. A lot of the stuff you hear on the radio comes from the 1950s, Bing Crosby, etc.. 

There is also some sad song that comes on the radio at Christmas time about some kid who wants to buy her dying mother some shoes and doesn't have any money, which is fairly new in the grand scheme of Christmas songs but seems to have become a Christmas staple. 

Some of the traditional Christmas songs are very old, we're talking two and three centuries, maybe even more in cases where we might have carried something over from the middle ages or the era of all those competing composers in Europe, like the songs from Handel's Messiah. We like what's familiar.

Patch 1.8 - Match Making Issues + Thoughts/Ideas
u/TTShazy
This patch is so bad (off to a good start)
****
I disagree. I think this patch is brilliant with the changes. Now is there more work to do like addressing Cassie burst and Strix infinite flare? Yes. But small steps first. If you know game design... you never do everything~ at once since that could lead to unforeseen effects that are then too hard to pinpoint down. 
****
.... in lower elo the only way to carry 4 players playing worse than bots was to use a broken champion like willo, now you reduced the potential of solo carry (or better, the champion pool that can solo carry).
****
Willo is still good though...? 

And you can carry with a majority of damage and flank heroes. Certain supports can also carry such as Furia and potentially Ying and Jenos. 

But there are other heroes to try and you can keep using Willo. Like Viktor had his shrapnel nerf but will that stop people from using him? Nope~ I'm still a Viktor main and that talent is still very strong. 
****
Matchmaking is disgusting and nothing is done about it. I hear people say ""just have fun it's a game"" then they proceed to lock in moji and run it down, die and then hide because they are useless.

You create the dilemma of, Do i pick Moji/Lex because low elo players cant kill them or do i pick androxus/evie to Learn the flanks that have the most of potential? do i pick willo or drogoz? kinessa/strix or tyra/victor?
****
Umm... you pick based on what you're good at or want to play...? In fact if you were decent enough you could play whatever and still carry so this dilemma shouldn't exactly exist. Like say you main Willo and are good enough to influence games. Regardless of who picks what... just go Willo and do well~

This isn't a matchmaking system issue as much as apparently a low elo player issue imo. The matchmaking isn't perfect but it's far from terrible from my experiences. My only complaint is when I queue with my friend who's like half my elo... his elo is ignored and instead we get high elo only while he's the only one with his elo range. I wished it tried to make a mirror of his elo on the enemy team but it's whatever~

But anyway what you described is elo meta issues...? And that's just due to the players themselves and not the game itself. 
****
For The Matchmaking In Ranked (i recommend): RESTRICT RANKED FOR LOW LEVEL PLAYERS + USE OLD METHOD: you gotta be #z LVL and have #x champions over #y LVL to play or something similar (just in case: you must be over lvl 30 and have 15 champs over lvl 12)
****
I don't disagree here and this is a fair point. Maybe increasing requirements might help but~ realize not too many people play ranked so this will hurt that lower number even more. Personally I think it's fine as of now but maybe making rank harder to access might help. Not sure~
****
Put ROLE PREFERENCES like LoL. 3 of them (or more) NOT 2, excample 1) Supp Flank Range 2) Tank Flank Blaster 3)Flank Supp Antifrontline, come up with stuff. Like - You gotta know 3 roles to play ranked?
****
This would help but~ you run into queue time issues plus who's to say the meta is x roles? What if the meta becomes like... 3 damage and no flanks? Or 3 flanks and no damage?

So role queue helps but... roles are super flexible. That or combine the damage and flank role to like... just a damage category. But as you can see that gets tricky. So imo it's fine to not include a role queue. 
****
In casuals: calculate mmr by looking at winrates, kda, dmg output. You say kda means nothing but it means Great Positioning + Understanding Of The Game (ult cooldowns, engage time, etc).
****
Paladins.guru. The game already does that. I have a friend with the same win rate as me or so and yet I'm 2x the elo due to I'm guessing performance differences. So yes... casual elo accounts for other stats. 
****
- Also i wanna point out that, i had 10 game win streak, and the 11th i was queued up with Silvers. How can a 10 game win streak not rise the MMR? what was my mmr before? because that scares me... one time i queue VS Bugzy Tenner and Unbe (they were in a party ,while i was playing solo) and then the other game with silver players?? I get depressed every time due to the ignorance and the uselessness of low elo players and ""have fun guys"".

HOW IS MMR CALCULATED? IS THERE MMR? WHY DO I HAVE GRANDMASTERS FROM NA/BRAZIL IN MY EU SERVER RANK LIST? DO THEY AFFECT MY MATCHMAKING TOO?
****
If you play at a certain time with no players on... the system grabs whoever is left. So that means silver + masters vs silver + masters or bronze and master vs diamonds. 
****
i need awnsers not a new moji skin after nerfing him to the ground nor 4 DJ skins for champions that have alot of skins already. Bugfixes/FPS drop rate fixes for champs isn't fixed + You release a NEW FEATURE where the enemy champions skins will probably MESS UP THE FPS due to unique animated skins! NICE IDEA GUYS, next make hyper animated mounts and increase particles because you know, making us stop playing/lag/buy a 1,5k $ pc is better than fixing tha game is better, right? spend money on artists instead of devs or whatever...
****
Lowest option disables a lot of particle effects. Try that out.

During the Crusades copies of those writing were sent back to Europe.  The vast system of monasteries and proto-universities that the Church had built eagerly translated and dispersed those writings.  
  
The Muslim world took up a lot of the old Hellenic empire of Alexander the Great and they embraced that heritage.  To that end they kept Greek thought.  Early Islam had many scholars and centers of learning like Damascus and Cordoba.  This was because the Muslim world was still largely populated by Christians and the implications of the principles of Islam hadn't been worked out.  
  
But when the Christian world got these writings, they fit right in because Christianity originated in the Greco-Roman world.  Paul would have known them almost as well as he knew Jewish scripture.  The Scholastics synthesized Greek and Christian writing to produce what we call ""The West"".  There was an intellectual explosion both in terms of philosophy/theology and practical technology.  
  
Christians were in constant contact with the Muslim world due to the crusader states, wars, and raids.  The reasoning of theology going in in Christendom prompted the Muslims to answer similar questions.  They answered them differently.  Christians founded science, Muslims embraced occasionalism which undercuts science.  Thus the paths diverged.

**Net Profit: +8.92 Units (4k Starting balance - $100 units)**

**Yesterday's Pick**: **NHL - Pittsburgh Penguins ML @ NY Islanders @ 1.66 - 3 UNITS - 7PM EST L**

Unfortunate loss on Pittsburgh yesterday. Came down to a shootout and the Pens couldn't come through where they normally thrive. We only out shot the Islanders 31-26 this game anyway, so the offense didn't do as much as we hoped for, but Murray definitely bounced back and had a good game. Sorry for the loss boys. On to this next one.

**Today's Pick**: **Soccer - France Ligue 1 - PSG vs Lille - PSG Over 2.5 goals @ 1.72 - 2 UNITS - 3:45 PM EST**

**Pick Explanation:** Although I normally make picks in the NBA/NHL/NFL, I also do follow a little bit of Soccer in European leagues and did some good research on this pick before making it. Currently PSG are obviously 1st overall in Ligue 1 (11W -0D-0L) and Lille are having a stunning season (8W-1D-2L) being second in the table. PSG are averaging over 3.5 goals per game and are absolutely dominating the league. They cannot be stopped - and although Lille have only conceded 8 goals on the season, they haven't even faced a team half as good as PSG. They haven't faced Lyon yet who are one of the better teams below PSG. Also Lille have had some struggles away this season, where PSG are playing in great form at home. The key point to this bet is that Lille's success this season has come from incredible chemistry and performance by their young strikers. Their offense is performing better than ever and when they are faced against a team like PSG who will control the game, that offensive ability will diminish and I don't think they will be able to prevent PSG from scoring 3 goals at the very least. The over on the game in general isn't a bad idea either, but my POTD is just on PSG over 2.5 because I don't trust that Lille will get enough opportunities.

On bnet, there are 4 realms. Us east, us west, Asia, and Europe. the realms have different populations, peak hours, and active game types. Europe has the most, about 3x the population of west or east.

Europe: 1v1 queue is generally &lt;1m whatever time; 2v2 queue &lt;1m during peak hours, able to find a game most other times; 3v3 dead; 4v4 can find game any time of day;

East: 1v1 &lt;2m during peak. Off peak I generally don’t have patience to wait, will queue on Europe with 200 ping;

2v2 - only during peak; 4v4 - can generally find a game at any time

West: Same as above, but 4v4 is also harder to find off peak

False,ScreamOfVengeance,1499780049.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_pcal0y,False,"THE BREXITEERS have become the angry brigade of British politics. Boris Johnson has accused Theresa May of wrapping a suicide vest around Britain. Jacob Rees-Mogg has accused her of being “cowed” by the European Union. And several Tory MPs have used anonymous briefings to savage her in the press. “The moment is coming when the knife gets heated, stuck in her front and twisted,” declared one conspirator who is probably more familiar with “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” than the complete works of Edmund Burke. “She’ll be dead soon.”

The obvious reason for this is that Brexiteers think that Mrs May is wrecking a project that has consumed much of their lives. They are furious that she botched the election of 2017 with a wooden campaign and a shoddy manifesto. This has weakened the government’s hand in dealing not only with recalcitrant Remainers but also with cunning Europeans who are determined to exploit any sign of British weakness. They are equally cross that she is betraying what they consider to be the glorious principles of Lancaster House, the speech in which she laid down various “red lines” about leaving the European Union.

There is a lively debate about why Mrs May has done this. Was she always going to betray them? (She voted to remain before briefly becoming the Boudica of Brexit.) Or was she corrupted by establishment types such as Olly Robbins, the civil servant in charge of the negotiations? Or was she simply ground down by European bureaucrats? That she is a traitor is now taken as a given.

There is also a deeper reason why Brexiteers are so angry. Mrs May represents the reality principle in a political world dominated by fantasy and wish-fulfilment. She didn’t fluff last year’s election only because of a wooden campaign and a botched manifesto. She also fluffed it because a more or less equally divided nation was not willing to give her carte blanche to pursue a hard Brexit. She didn’t blur the red lines of Lancaster House just because she was manipulated and deceived. She blurred them because she is trying to avoid terrible hazards such as a breakdown of trade with the EU or the imposition of a hard border in Ireland. Irving Kristol, the godfather of neo-conservatism, described his tribe as liberals who have been mugged by reality. Brexiteers are Tories who are furious that reality has proved to be more stubborn than they imagined.

They believed that leaving the European Union would be a cake walk. Liam Fox pronounced that “the free-trade agreement that we will have to do with the EU should be one of the easiest in human history.” John Redwood averred that “getting out of the EU can be quick and easy—the UK holds most of the cards in any negotiation.” In fact, leaving the EU is likely to be one of the hardest bureaucratic exercises in post-war history. That is not just because the EU is determined to make it difficult (though it is), but because unravelling 45 years’ worth of trading regulations is inevitably complicated and time-consuming.

The Brexiteers believed that Britain would be able to have all the benefits of the single market while also striking trade deals with the rest of the world—that “there will be no downside to Brexit, only a considerable upside,” as David Davis said, or that Britain would be able to have its cake and eat it, as Mr Johnson pronounced in a phrase that should be carved on his tombstone. But leaving the EU inevitably involves difficult trade-offs. Britain has to choose between maintaining open access to the EU’s single market (which means complying with its rules) or freeing itself to make independent trade deals with the rest of the world (which means losing automatic access to the EU’s market). It may yet have to make an even harder trade-off within its own borders: treating Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK, which would eventually tie the province more closely to the Republic of Ireland, or accepting a soft Brexit.

The Brexiteers further believed that the EU would prove to be a pushover. During the referendum campaign, Michael Gove promised that “the day after we vote to leave we hold all the cards and we can choose the path we want.” In fact, the EU not only has a lot more cards in its pack than Britain—27 member states, including aces such as France and Germany. It also has more experience, as a regulatory superpower that is used to dealing with other superpowers such as China and America. Some Brexiteers also thought that Britain would be the praetorian guard of a revolution against an ossified global order, represented by Brussels. In fact, the EU has arguably been strengthened rather than weakened by Britain’s imminent departure, while pro-Europeanism has gone from being an exotic taste in Britain to a real force. And Britain’s fellow rebels against the old world order consist of such dubious figures as Matteo Salvini and Donald Trump.

The new moaners

There is an element of vanity in this. Many Brexiteers spent decades in the wilderness, being dismissed as “swivel-eyed loons” by senior Tories. They thought that the referendum result would finally turn them into prophets and heroes. But it is increasingly looking as if the establishment types got it right. Preparations for a no-deal Brexit are becoming increasingly ominous, as the government prepares to charter container ships to import food and drugs, and turn a Kent motorway into a giant lorry park.

There are two very different ways that you can react to reality when it turns out to be harsher than you expected. You can recognise reality for what it is, and try to render it a bit more palatable by hard work and careful thought. Or you can rage against it—and bolster your rage with talk about ideals betrayed and simple solutions denied. Mrs May is no one’s model of a perfect prime minister. But it is to her credit that she has tried hard to grapple with a fiendishly difficult problem. And it is to the discredit of Brexiteers that, rather than helping Mrs May to do her duty, they have decided to rage against her.",True,False,False,,0,1541107765,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e8vhp8c,True,t3_9tdp8x,True,t3_9tdp8x,/r/ukpolitics/comments/9tdp8x/brexiteers_are_angry_not_just_with_theresa_may/e8vhp8c/,,1544880623,3,True,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,r/ukpolitics,public,

&gt; Johann (Hans) Hölzel (19 February 1957 – 6 February 1998), better known by his stage name Falco, was an Austrian rap, pop and rock musician and had four #1 Hits - ""Der Kommissar"", ""Rock Me Amadeus"", ""Jeanny"" and ""Coming Home (Jeanny Part 2, Ein Jahr danach)"". 

&gt; He is the only artist to score a #1 Hit in the U.S. with a German language song, and his albums and singles have sold about 60 million copies worldwide.

&gt; 
Early Years

&gt; Born in Vienna, studying at the Vienna Music Conservatory in 1977 which he left after one semester to pursue a career in music, he lived for a short time in West Berlin while singing in a jazz-rock band. When he returned to Vienna he was calling himself ""Falco,"" reportedly in tribute to the East German ski jumper Falko Weißpflog, and playing in the Austrian bands Spinning Wheel and Hallucination Company. En route to becoming an international rock star in his own right, he was bass player in the Austrian hard rock-punk rock band Drahdiwaberl (from 1978 until 1983). With Drahdiwaberl he wrote and performed the song ""Ganz Wien"" which he would also include on his debut solo album Einzelhaft.

&gt; 
Individual success

&gt; Falco's first hit was ""Der Kommissar"" from the 1982 album Einzelhaft. A German language song about drug consumption that combines rap verses with a sung chorus, Falco's record was a number-one success in many countries but failed to break big in the U.S. The song, however, would prove to have a life of its own in two English-language versions. British Rock band After the Fire recorded an English cover version, loosely based on Falco's lyrics and also called ""Der Kommissar"" (with ""uh-oh"" and ""alles klar Herr Kommissar"" the only other lyrics held over from the original). This time, the song shot to number three in the United States (their only major hit there) in 1983, though it failed to crack the UK Top 40. The band - who had been together more than a decade - broke up almost immediately thereafter. That same year, American singer Laura Branigan recorded a version of the song with new English lyrics, under the title ""Deep in the Dark"" on her album Branigan 2.

&gt; After a second album, Junge Roemer, failed to provide a repeat to his debut single's success (outside of Austria and Germany, where the album topped the charts), Falco began to experiment with English lyrics in an effort to broaden his appeal, and chose a new production team. The result would be the most popular album and single of his career.

&gt; Falco recorded ""Rock Me Amadeus"" inspired in part by the Oscar-winning film Amadeus, and the song became a worldwide hit in 1986. This time, his record reached #1 in the U.S. and UK, bringing him the success that had eluded him in that major market a few years earlier. The song remained in the top spot of the Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks and his album, Falco 3, fittingly peaked at the number three position on the Billboard album charts. Unheard of at the time for a white performer, much less a European one, the Austrian rapper's single climbed to the upper reaches of the Billboard Top R&amp;B Singles Chart (only a few years earlier called the ""Black Singles"" chart), peaking at number 6. Falco 3 peaked at number 18 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums charts. Ultimately, ""Rock Me Amadeus"" went to the #1 spot in over a dozen countries including the Soviet Union and Japan. Follow-up single ""Vienna Calling"" was another international pop hit, peaking at #18 of the Billboard Charts and #17 on the U.S. Cash Box Charts in 1986. A double A-side 12"" single featuring remixes of those two hits peaked at #4 on the U.S. Dance/Disco charts.

&gt; ""Jeanny"" the third release from the album Falco 3, brought the performer back to the top of the charts across Europe. Highly controversial when it was released in Germany and the Netherlands, the story of ""Jeanny"" was told from the point of view of a rapist and possible murderer. Several DJs and radio stations refused to play the ballad, which was ignored in the U.S., although it became a huge hit in many European countries, and inspired two sequels on later albums.

&gt; In 1986, the album Emotional was released, produced by Rob and Ferdi Bolland (Bolland &amp; Bolland). On the Album were ""Coming Home (Jeanny Part 2, Ein Jahr danach)""  and the song ""Kamikaze Cappa"" which was written as a tribute to the late photojournalist Robert Capa. ""The Sound of Musik"" was another international success, and a Top 20 U.S. Dance hit, though he failed to make the U.S. pop charts. He also went on ""Emotional-Tour"" which was a world tour where he ended up in Japan at 1987. In 1987, he sang a duet with Brigitte Nielsen ""Body Next to Body"" and the single was a Top 10 hit in the Germanic countries. The Album Wiener Blut was released in 1988 but it did not get much publicity outside Germany and Austria.

&gt; After ""Jeanny,"" there were a number of European hits, but Falco was rarely heard in the U.S. and the UK. His 1992 U.S. comeback attempt, the album Nachtflug with the song ""Titanic"" won a number of awards, but failed to chart in America.

&gt; 
Death

&gt; Falco died of severe injuries received from a collision with a bus in his Mitsubishi Pajero near the city of Puerto Plata, in the Dominican Republic on 6 February 1998, just two weeks before his 41st birthday. While it was initially reported that the autopsy showed high blood levels of alcohol and cocaine, this was disputed. At the time of his death, he was working on a comeback into the music world.
He was buried in the Zentralfriedhof (Central Cemetery) in Vienna, Austria.

&gt; Years active: 1974 -1998

The princes of Germany are who protected Luther and stole the fool away from his last meeting with the Papacy, because the princes knew they would kill him. So the ""kidnapped"" him so to speak, to start the Bible printing process as Reform churches began to spring up in the wake. But, a case in point, the secular reaction was one of ""Enlightenment"" by anything but Christendom religion, that was the  spark of the Renaissance. Thus, where the pieces fall in a reaction to organized heresy in Christendom, is a case study of Europe up to and after the 1500s. You just don't know where the pieces may fall, but it was the end of the 1000 year reign of the Papacy. It was called the ""Dark Ages"" as Catholocism was the ""light"", actually a blackhole that governed them ""Dark Ages"".

I cannot see a situation in which the UK financial sector is stronger outside of EU, they simply have no control over European decisions, but since they still want access to European markets they have to follow their rules.  However, in future anomalies like Euro clearing becoming concentrated outside a euro country, are not going to be tolerated.

Preserving the dominance of London as a financial centre is not a concern of the EU anymore.  Whether Paris or Frankfurt are ever as dominant as London has been is doubtful, but irrelevant.  If there is a bigger slice of the pie to be had at Londons expense, well Britain isn't in the EU anymore to argue against it and wants out of the institution that ensures the UK wasn't penalised for being a non-euro country within said institution, or that the aforementioned institution is actually following its own rules (ECJ).",True,False,False,,0,1541111214,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e8vlshh,False,t3_9t9bx9,True,t1_e8vjllx,/r/ukpolitics/comments/9t9bx9/michel_barnier_misleading_press_articles_today_on/e8vlshh/,,1544882528,2,True,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,r/ukpolitics,public,

Correct. But when there's a bloody great desert that puts the Sahara to shame bordering one of them, one has to wonder if 'northern' might not be somewhat relative.

It has Polish monsters running around, I'll grant you. But I didn't read anyone praying to Thor. So I have to disagree on the 'they share a mythology' statement.

Adaptations change stuff. GoT changed characters' eye colour, hair colour, and - yes - race. LoTR didn't have those with Numenorean blood (Aragorn, Boromir, Faramir etc) running around with raven hair and grey eyes. Hell, they even cut out the rest of the Dunedain.

&gt; skin but most importantly the all of the people living in that medieval era subcontinent should reasonable have the same race

Why? The human civilisation of the Witcher world didn't evolve naturally, it's an outside influence that arrived with the Conjunction of the Spheres. Who's to say who/what mix of ethnicities crossed over?

And who's to say - culturally - that humans of different skin tones wouldn't intermingle? It happened in the Roman era (and the Medieval too, in certain parts of Europe) and that was without numerous other sentient races for us to fight against, instead of turning on ourselves and isolating ourselves.

Polish people especially in Western Europe are constantly discriminated against, half the anti immigration groups in England were set up over negative sentiment towards Eastern European immigrants.

You have an extremely US centric viewpoint. Which Black ethnic group are you talking about? The Zulu, Xhoti , Bantu, Hutu.

False,Wallabystyle,1322584220.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_6c4cy,False,"OP, pelos seus posts você parece ser uma pessoa bem esclarecida e madura, apesar da pouca idade.

Nunca faça o ""elas ou eu"". JAMAIS. Nunca pense nessa possibilidade. Deixe-a livre para que ela faça o que quiser. Sempre que ela for, ela vai voltar pra você. Isso eu te garanto. Jamais fique em posição inferior socialmente. Não implore para que ela volte e não jogue-a contra a parede. Não a force a nada.

Procure sempre dar o exemplo e busque seu próprio desenvolvimento. Incentive-a a também buscar o desenvolvimento pessoal.

A minha experiência mostra que quanto mais a pessoa se desenvolve, mais a pessoa passa a ser deslocada, tanto de suas amizades, quanto junto às pessoas de seu relacionamento - sobretudo se essas não se desenvolvem. 

Assim, considerando que você se desenvolva pessoalmente, seu futuro com ela terá duas hipóteses:

1. Sem o desenvolvimento pessoal dela, o deslocamento entre vocês dois se torna tão grande que um relacionamento entre os dois não será proveitoso para você e nem para ela. - Nesta hipótese, apesar de perder uma companheira e ficar triste inicialmente,  você ficará mais feliz, a longo prazo, de forma que poderá encontrar alguém melhor para você.

2. Ela se desenvolve junto com você e acaba muito deslocada das ""amigas"" que pouco se desenvolveram. Nessa hipótese, a sua namorada automaticamente se distanciará dessas companhias por seu deslocamento e continuará a caminhada com você. 

É muito difícil reencontrar um grande amigo ou uma ex-namorada que você não vê há tempos e perceber que vocês já não têm mais nada em comum. Mas é isso que acontece. Isso é natural.
 quanto mais você lê e estuda, mais insuportável fica de conviver com os idiotas.﻿

Então, você não deve sofrer por medo de perdê-la. Caso ela seja influenciada pelas amigas e termine com você ou resolva te trair, você irá sofrer inicialmente, mas precisa ter mentalidade de que você se livrou daquilo, sobretudo porque a pessoa com quem você namorava não era exatamente a pessoa que você achava que era. Você perderá a admiração e aquilo, de uma forma ou de outra, te beneficiará.

Contudo, de toda forma, a ideia  é você se tornar uma pessoa muito mais valorosa que as amigas. Assim, mantendo a admiração por você e percebendo a distância entre elas e você, a sua namorada automaticamente fará uma escolha que no fim será vantajoso para você.

Nunca se preocupe em demasia com as coisas que você não consegue controlar, apenas siga sua vida.

De toda sorte, caso deseje ""tentar salvar"" a sua namorada das más companhias de forma mais a curto prazo, o que pode não ter tanta eficácia quanto a forma que falei acima, sugiro que você traga-a mais para o seu mundo. Faça atividades juntos, apresente amigos, arrume programas a quatro com um casal de amigos. Faça programas culturais divertidos. Viaje. Traga ela para seus amigos.

Se ela quiser sair com as amigas, deixe-a. Saia com seus amigos ou fique estudando. Não reclame delas e não fique atrás dela. Deixe que ela sinta sua falta e que te veja com valor. Não pegue o celular dela, não se importe com o que as amigas dizem de você, se mostre superior. Apenas mostre posição se perguntado, de forma firme, porém desinteressada.

Reafirme, sempre que ela se mostrar insegura, o seu amor por ela - de forma não necessitada -, mas saiba a hora de deixar ela com medo de te perder.



De toda sorte, se você quer sinceridade, OP, apenas pela sua breve narrativa e pelos seus comentários, eu percebi que você é uma pessoa com muito potencial e com muito valor, enquanto sua namorada está ficando para trás: está se relacionando com ""pessoas âncoras"", cuja amizade pouco vale. Se ela vê algum relacionamento possível com essas pessoas, isso é um indicativo ""red flag"". 
Na minha experiência pessoal e por ter visto muitos amigos meus passando por algo parecido, é bastante provável que, se ela continuar nessa toada, ela acabará terminando, por influência - ela vai querer se relacionar com outras pessoas para ver como é, usará drogas e etc.

Caso ela termine, fale que você a ama muito e que deseja ficar com ela. Explica que as coisas podem ser diferentes, mas deixe-a ir. JAMAIS IMPLORE ou fique atrás dela. Respeite-a. Você vai sofrer. MUITO. Mas vai passar. E, se você não implorou, não ficou atrás, não ficou mandando mensagens ou ligações no meio da noite, e a respeitou é MUITO provável que ela vá querer um dia voltar. Mas talvez fique tarde: você estará em outra. E muito melhor. Caso não seja o caso, vocês se encontrarão no futuro e ficarão juntos novamente.

Em qualquer hipótese, não se preocupe muito com isso. Se preocupe com você.

Again, quit the bullshit. What happens in the rest of the world, is no excuse for the US problem. 

Not to mention the US are negatively impacting the rest of the world.

Other countries have to compete with the US, they can't make too much efforts while the US is doing nothing. International treaties on climate change have failed because of the US. 

&gt;That is by far the largest decline of any country in the world over that timespan and is nearly as large as the 770 million metric ton decline for the entire European Union.

Considering how much more the US emits, this means the US are doing terrible compared to the EU.

Carbon market emissions are not the same as carbon emissions. We have already seen the EU is doing much better in carbon emissions than the US.

An increase in carbon market emissions means the EU is giving more money to support the efforts of other countries.

I think this is a more reasonable approach.  But even this gets difficult as the range of skin color goes from pale ghost to tan to light brown to a very dark brown.  For example, I'm very white but I could prolly tan to become the same skin color as Valerie Jarrett (from the Rossanne controversy) because she's so very light complected, but I'd need to darken skin significantly to pull off Whoopie Goldberg since she's extremely dark.  

&amp;nbsp;

I think we need to go back to context and intent mattering.  Not the context and intent of what people did before any of our lifetimes, but the context and intent of the people doing things now.  

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Also, to be quite blunt, the context of the past is often selectively applied.  Example:  when it comes to slavery and the history of oppression the African people are actually more guilty of this than anyone.  In fact when they were doing apology rounds in Africa for their part in slavery the Ugandan president named Yoweri Museveni went on record saying: ""African chiefs were the ones waging war on each other and capturing their own people and selling them. If anyone should apologies it should be the African chiefs. We still have those traitors here even today"".  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/18/africans-apologise-slave-trade  

You don't hear much about the African involvement in the slave trade though or the millions upon mllions of Europeans they enslaved.  The Barbary Pirates alone enslaved over a million Europeans they sold to North Africa and the Ottoman Empire.  They were based in North Africa.  

&amp;nbsp;

This is not a gotcha, it's not some huge talking point, it's just an example that we focus on some contexts while we let others completely slide by.  I had to do research to learn about all the above and then verify and cross reference it myself, it was never taught or told to me.  

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Maybe it's time we let the blackface stuff fade away by if it's well intentioned with decent context.  Like that German girl who just wanted to cosplay as Michonne from The Walking Dead.  I don't think there should be any problem with someone liking the role played by a black actress so much they wanted to dress up as them.  If anything that should be exactly the sort of bridges we should be trying to build...instead of trying to tear those bridges down.

&amp;nbsp;

And if someone is genuinely being a jerk with it, then yeah vilify them for being a jerk.  Not because of the blackface.  THAT is what it means to move past race IMO and the absolute focus on the blackface instead of the context/intention is what focusing on race looks like IMO.",True,False,False,,0,1541116610,,1541116818,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e8vrqk2,False,t3_9teabz,True,t1_e8von8t,/r/changemyview/comments/9teabz/cmv_being_offended_by_blackface_is_irrational/e8vrqk2/,,1544885291,0,True,False,changemyview,t5_2w2s8,r/changemyview,public,True

The Right Honourable gentleman claims that it would be up to the EU to slap tariffs on the UK, he implies it is a choice. Under such a scenario as created by the folly of the Right Honourable gentleman, they would be legally obligated under GATT to charge MFN tariffs on UK goods.

He then says that all of the customs checks problems will go away because both sides have a ""strong economic interest in keeping trade running smoothly"", that's what a trade deal is Mr Speaker, and he's the one arguing for no deal.

Under a no deal scenario, there is no facilitation for customs, because that is what no deal means. Just as Brexit means Brexit, No Deal means No Deal.

If there's no agreement on sanitary and phytosanitary standards, then it will likely be flat out illegal to export agricultural goods from the UK to the EU. If there's no agreement then there will be no proceedure for confirming compliance of general technical standards to the EU, requiring costly and burdensome preclearance, without which again, exporting becomes illegal.

- Muslims have Muslim countries to live in. America, and Europe (save Bosnia) is not for them. They have to go back!

Yihtzak Rabin was a real person. His election and goals were real. It wasn't so long ago that everyone simply forgot. I believe in a future for Israel where everyone can share the land and its rich deep history equally. Jerusalem is a good start, I personally feel like some of the compromises that are made to prevent certain religions from offending other religions are too restrictive, but it's a start.

Eventually I hope that the model applied to Israel to end the conflict could be applied in other parts of the world to end genocides and displacements of populations. I don't personally believe this will happen for 20 years or more though, after hearing some thoughts of Israelis. It's going to take another generation at least.

When I asked at the end ""who is the bad guy again?"" The rhetorical answer I was going for was ""the West"", for their centuries of anti-Semitism and awfully planned out colonialism that drove Jews to that point. The Sykes-Pichot agreement was before WWI was even over, as a plan for Europe to split up the Ottoman empire with zero consent from the people living there.

People love to make the Jews out to be horrible people in all of this, we're the classic historical scapegoat. But honestly read the history. Ive been trying to read as many perspectives of the history as I can, but it's so difficult to get past propaganda. The Jews in Israel were fighting *against* the British occupying force for God's sake, because it was just more oppression.

&gt;They immigrated to lands that was occupied by people and forced their way in with weapons and support from the West while kicking out the people there.

Early Jewish people immigrating back to Israel certainly wanted to force their way into the status quo, but through normal population growth and land purchases. Violence wasn't their goal. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Aliyah

I've read articles as well about Jewish raids on Arav villages, women and children killed, etc. But this is already after the conflict had begun. These raids were reprehensible and generated anger throughout the region, but were in response to other actions taken against them. It was war at that point.

Remember, when Britain pulled out of Mandatory Palestine, the population in areas like Tzfat was 10% Jewish and 90% Arab. And ""support from the West""??? The police stations were in Arab controlled cities! If anything, Britain supported Palestine far more at the time, because Palestine was the more established population. Jews faught against the British during that time to try to get some freedom instead of the continued oppression they were facing. Jews had less rights, less power, and were facing continued oppression even after WWII. Jews then also returned from WWII to join their compatriots, which is probably what you're thinking of when talking about support from the West.

Modern day government support for Israel simply wasn't there in remotely the same way back during the formation of the country. It was mostly wealthy Western families giving support to the immigrants.

&gt;Imagine Muslims coming to the US with guns and taking a whole state and when we try to defend they throw up a flag and say ""no stop, we're only immigrants"" and then calling us terrorists for shooting back.

The differences here are so vast. Imagine Mexican immigration being huge during the mid to late 1800s, establishing largely Mexican immigrant run areas in the southwest, then imagine Americans rioting and trying to kill them all over the next 40 years until an occupying country took over and policed them both for 20 years. That's more like what happened in Israel. It's simply not comparable.

Edit: I just realized how long and rambling this is. My apologies! I'm trying to build more of a knowledge about the history of the region, and as a Jew I know for certain that I'm getting pretty one sided information. It's almost comical how you can read an article written by an Israeli historian and a Palestinian historian and get two totally different explanations of the event. The peasants revolt is one major example.

I wasn't denying that. In fact, that is why I used the ""-"". They aren't lesser white, they were unjustly seen as that.  

What I'm saying is that non-whites, as a whole, have suffered more of less similar situations.

This is true, but modern Americans or Western Europeans rarely suffer racism at the level of non-white People.

There is nothing different about the current demographic change. Demographic changes have been happening since the founding of the country. Irish, Italian, and Eastern Europeans weren't always seen as white. Heck, even Russians were once not considered white. 

There is nothing remarkable about the current demographic change. There was a time when the tribalistic tensions you mentioned led to the second coming of the Ku Klux Klan. There was also a time when racial tensions made large American cities like New York, Los Angeles, Houston, Chicago, Philadelphia, and others extremely dangerous.

**Improvements:**

\- Ships themselves now have baked in abilities and linked actions (replacing PTL) in many cases, making generics a bit more useful.  Actions/maneuvers that didn't exist until later in the game are added to older ships that need/deserve them (reload on various bombers, s-loops/T-rolls on certain fighters, etc).  **Put differently, the ships themselves are buffed, the pilots and upgrades are nerfed.**

\- Token stacking is an exception, not a norm. 

\- Initiative being from 1 to 6 (with a few ""shoot at i7"" cards/abilities out there) means there's less of a PS war.  It also means that the mid range initiative ships aren't dead weight like they often were as mid level PS ships in 1E.

\- Half points for half damage on all ships

\- Medium base ships

\- Charge tokens limiting use of abilities.  To quote the designers, they found that you could either use something once per game, once per turn, or have it be unlimited.  Now they have some control over how many times in a game you can do it.  Also, this has been placed on all ordnance so when you buy something you can shoot it 2-4 times depending on the missile/torp.

\- Due to rebalancing of ships that were released early in 1E, a game of 2E actually looks like Star Wars, not like a bunch of random EU ships you've only heard of if you played the right video games or read the right comic books (not saying those ships are bad now, just that TIE swarms and X-wings can win tournaments again).  

\- The FORCE!!  Force users can spend force charges to change their eyeballs to hits/evades.  They also take force powers instead of EPTs, which at first I thought was annoying but then I realized was very important for balance.  Don't want someone getting a reroll from predator and then flipping that eyeball to a hit.  Passive mods are kind of dead now.

\- No more 360 degree firing arcs!  All those ships have mobile arcs now (some are two sided bowtie arcs, some are just one).  Rotating the arc costs something, be it an action, a gunner that can do it as part of their ability, etc.

\- Crew has been split into ""gunners"" and ""crew' which limits who can go in what ship.  This is pretty smart from a balance standpoint.

\- Each ship is limited to two attacks per turn, the second being called a bonus attack.  If quickdraw comes back with the same ability, she will no longer be able to double tap twice in a turn, for instance.

\- Rebels/Resistance have been split up, as have the imperials/first order.  This will probably prove smart for balance.

\- Bombs are now dropped before activating.  No more bombs dropped as actions.  

\- The conversion kits themselves.  It's great to have (almost) everything you want as far as upgrades, and the kits are cheaper than buying new ships for ""fix"" cards or other upgrades.

\- FFG have said they will make sure that any upgrade a faction can use appears in a product for that faction.  They've also said there will be a way to get cards so we don't have to go buy the same ships again as they get re-released, but they haven't explained how this will work.

\- For the most part, ""control"" isn't nearly what it used to be.  There are very few cards that punish you for attacking, like R3A2, hotshot copilot,  which has a new name that escapes me right now) is now only when you attack, not when you defend), and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

**Stuff that's not so good:**

\- Although there is less OP nonsense out there, dice variance matters a lot more now.  To the point where I even sometimes say ""I think I only won that because the dice screwed my opponent""  It also means you can spend a load of points on ordnance and have a bad roll followed by a bad reroll (with target lock) and have it go nowhere.  This was always a problem in 1E, but without stuff like guidance chips, expertise, having a focus and a TL easily, etc, it can be frustrating now.

\- Most EPTs are pretty worthless or have a niche role.

\- Although there isn't much of a clear meta just yet, there are a few cards that are definitely annoying that will likely get a cost increase come January.

\- If you like coming up with original, janky ideas, there is a lot less space in which to do that.

\- I actually think games are longer now, based on the fact that we rarely get to squeeze in a third game in our \~4 hour X-wing night at my FLGS.  Some folks say they are shorter, but since it's so hard to get fully modded shots, stuff is harder to kill.  With swarms being more common now, it just takes more time to move around a load of TIEs than a shuttle and two defenders.

&gt;""Getting protected from being offended by what other people say"". Nobody is asking the federal or state government to protect them against hearing opposing viewpoints.

I didn't claim that the tension I identified among feminism's waves was for or against government censorship.  I thought we were talking about SJW's and feminist *social* movements.  If you're not familiar with feminists seeking to protect themselves from disagreeable ideas, then you aren't familiar with feminists on campuses demanding trigger warnings, safe spaces, and disciplinary procedures that eliminate central principles of due process.  Then you aren't familiar with FIRE's superb record at successfully litigating campus speech codes.
https://www.thefire.org/speech-code-litigation-project/

I didn't write that feminists sought protection *by federal and state governments*against being offended, but there is an illiberal branch of modern Progressives who appear envious of European restrictions on ""hate speech.""  Let's also not forget that Democrats (weakly) attempted to amend the 1st Am., as a part of their response to the Citizens United decision.

I'm not making this up this tension within feminism.  Camille Paglia has spoken and written some interesting criticism of modern feminism along these lines. And if you really don't think there are feminists seeking protection from views they find offensive, you should review the reaction to James Damore's Google memo.  Future government censorship is danger posed by this movement, but censorship isn't necessary to demonstrate the present *tension* I accurately described between earlier and later feminist waves.

&gt;As for the party flipping, I'm not going to respond until you do your due diligence and research the topic. 

If you'd rather bow out than defend your repetition of a slur, I'd understand.  Due diligence would include figuring out how much of your own education was the product of Leftist propaganda.  Howard Zinn is an insufficient source.

If you'd like to defend your slur rather than bowing out, I'm amenable to specifying the issues on which you believe the parties flipped, and what evidence you believe supports your belief.  Since this mainly seems to come up regarding racism, I'll note that you offered zero substantive response to my earlier comment.

To Amazon's high paid workers, warehouse employees, monopoly, and delivery truck emissions don't exist.

At Apple, manufacturing slaves and wars for tantalum in the congo don't exist.

At Google, and facebook, the wholesale of people's private data to the oppressive security state and ruthless advertisers doesn't exist.

At Uber, drivers don't exist.

At pharmaceutical companies, opioid addicts and people who can't afford treatments don't exist.

To these companies, 10% of americans and europeans are productive and useful and deserve their fundamental rights and a comfortable life. Everyone else on the planet is cattle to be exploited for every ounce of money and labor you can squeeze out of them, until you've run them dry in which case it's more profitable to let them die.

The wealthy people who work at these companies pay lip-service to abstract causes, but don't dare upset the apple cart. Their concern is a status symbol, and nothing more. Even mentioning organizing around the problems they directly contribute to with their work (to change company policy in a *meaningful* way) is completely unacceptable, the idea is unspeakable and people get angry if you bring it up.

Well, if these countries are going to continue on their course of development continuing to grow their emissions because other countries did in the past, then that means that those countries really don't believe there's a problem. If they did, they'd curb their emissions, no matter what any other countries do or did. 

And the countries that are emitting more than any other country is going to 'take a bit longer'?? We're on about the 10th 'if we don't do something now it'll be too late' scenario. If you believe they can 'take a bit longer', then you don't really believe what the climate scientists are saying about it being too late already.  

&gt;So absolutely tiny countries are irrelevant when it comes to stats like this. 

Yes, and by that logic, the US is irrelevant when it comes to China. Math: 

The difference between what China emits on an annual basis and what the US emits is GREATER than the difference between the US and Curacao. Stop and think about that for a minute. No, really, just think about that. 

&gt;The fact of the matter is though that China hasn't come even close to producing as much CO2 as either the USA

Not yet, but it won't be long now. Currently, China produces more than twice as much as the USA, and the trends suggest that will grow. What will that mean in 10 years? 20 years? 50 years? If you really believe the problem is the rest of this century, then China should be your #1 point of focus. To suggest otherwise ignores math and science in favor of political propaganda.

If there's cars on either side and on the other side of the lot, there isn't enough room to do that entirely so most people just park kinda crooked.

When you reverse in the car pivots way closer to the parking space, and you also don't have cars on either side limiting the movement of the front. So you can line it up in less space and also it makes it easier to leave.

If your car has side view mirrors you can reverse into a spot. I always park my 20 year old CR-V (still a pretty big car by EU standards) by reversing in.

If you have a backup of your local save files (there are two, one with settings and another with data), restore them

Can also try delete local files (make a backup first just in case) and start game; you will get a message indicating that previous data was found on server and if we want to continue playing with that data; we must select ""YES"" (if we select ""No"" we will basically start a new game; and from here there is no way back).

Unfortunately there are various reports with that issue and above options do not solve problem for all.

I also suggest that you contact you local PlayStation Support and post in PS Community Forums (or had a note/comment to ones already there).

OK, lets just take your original point as you intended it. 
You said that the nationalist point of view ultimately leads to ""other things"" which you inferred was tyrany and conquest. The point I was making was that in order to resist tyrany and conquest you need to have a value structure that empowers the individual, you need to combat ideologies who's aim is to seize power. For a lot of people who voted Leave, they see the EU state experiment doing precisely what it is you're referring to - by tyranical. The best way to break up a large, corrupt body, is to fragment it down as far as possible to the point that the individual is empowered. That was the whole point.

Having that said, I personally don't relate at all to this issue. I don't really see this phenomenon in my social circle. I, as well as my friends (who happen to be male) have had plenty of friends (who happen to be female) and no one has ever made a big deal out of it. Of course you can befriend both guys and girls, they're all people, it seems like a no brainer, even though I respect that in a lot of social contexts this still is a hurdle. 


I also can't remember guy friends talking about each others' gfs in an objectifying way, you know, The Room-style ""anyway how's your sex life?"" or frat bro-style bragging about sex. It's all pretty normal stuff ""did you guys have a nice time on holiday"" etc. 


Of course because most of the guys are hetero there is also talk about being attracted to certain women. For example discussing each other's celebrity crushes, ""Jennifer Lawrence /Scarlett Johansson/Gal Gadot was pretty hot in movie X"". The women do that too among eachother I have noticed, I've overheard them talking about the werewolf guy and the vampire dude from Twilight. Also sometimes guys talking among eachother about certain female acquaintances ""well, X is pretty cute"". I'm not sure if that counts as 'objectification', whatever it is, it's an expression of physical attraction which is not the same as reducing an entire gender to their sex appeal. I think. 


I live somewhere in Europe, btw, so I don't know if that makes a difference.

&gt;**EU** **may**[ ...] **withdraw equivalence** [...] **autonomously**

So, in this hypothetical world, our current arrangements are recognised as equivalent to those of the EU. Hardly unsurprising, given that they are those of the EU. 

So, at this point we have one rulebook, followed by and written by both parties.

Then, we leave the EU. Our arrangements continue to be recognised as equivalent to the EU, because they are still from the EU.

So, at this point, we have one rulebook, written and followed by one party, and followed by one party.

Then, we attempt to diverge from the EU's rulebook, which we are following.

So, at this point, we have *two* rulebooks, *one of which is recognised as equivalent by the EU* (the one we were following [The EU's rulebook]), and *the other of which is not recognised as equivalent to the EU (the one we would now be following).

You seem to believe that the EU is *forced* to accept any changes to the rules we make. If the EU decides our rules are not equivalent (if we adjust solvency requirements, for example), then they have a right to cancel their recognition of equivalency.

In which case, we're fucked. The instant crash would ruin us.

Now, the EU is reasonably competent, and would likely warn us that our attempts to ignore the rules would break that recognition. I imagine you can see why our inability to write our own rules because it would destroy our economy might look like vassal statehood.

So, you see, your statement of:

&gt;And the EU will need to follow our rules, and get no say in writing them.

Is only true in the sense that they'll be following 'our' rulebook, which they have full control over.

We are a small semi-casual crew centered mostly in EU and would like to expand our small band of adventurers. Whether you are a veteran or a newcomer, with an advanced grid or a basic one, feel free to join us! A few things to know:


-We enforce no GW contribution quota. We would like everyone to have a good time while in our crew and the will to improve alongside each other. As such during GW you're free to contribute up to your own capability. Advancing is fun and good, burning out isn't.


-As mentioned before, rank, grid etc won't gate you from joinning. Everyone started small and if you wish to improve with our crew we're happy to have you.


-We have Drop Rate, Healing Pots &amp; Charge Bar buffs running 24/7 and a discord server. Feel free to use that or the in-game chat to communicate with the rest of the crew.


-If for whatever reason you need to go inactive, just let us know. We have a 3-weeks-rule when it comes to kicking inactive members that show no sign of existence so new people can join. Three weeks might seem like a long leeway compared to the usual inactivity quotas, but this way everyone has plenty of time to give a heads up if they are unable to play.

David Cameron enjoys a rare distinction: the only prime minister to call a referendum – on a matter of supreme national importance – and then lose it. For this act of hubris, Cameron rightly resigned.


But after more than two years spent writing his memoirs in a garden shed, the former prime minister is reportedly “bored shitless”. Yet rather than, say, taking up a musical instrument, or ploughing through the collected works of Proust, it is claimed that Cameron has set his sights on a bigger prize: the Foreign Office.


The Sun’s political editor Tom Newton Dunn, a reliable source of Cameroon Kremlinology, reports that the former PM “has told friends he is mulling a return to frontline politics, and fancies being foreign secretary”.



Now, admittedly, after the Lilliputian reign of Boris Johnson, it’s not unreasonable for anyone to aspire to lead the Foreign Office. But it would still take a special arrogance for Cameron to believe that he is the man for the job.



History will remember him for little else than Brexit – who now speaks of “the big society”? – but this is merely one of Cameron’s blunders. As prime minister in 2010, it was him, not George Osborne, who made the ultimate decision to impose the austerity that strangled growth and enfeebled the public realm.



Rough sleeping, which fell by three-quarters under the last Labour government, has risen by 169 per cent since 2010. Nearly 1,000 Sure Start children’s centres and 478 libraries are estimated to have closed. Again, so much for “the big society”.


Wherever one looks – the NHS (still recovering from the coalition’s reckless “reorganisation”), the prison system (understaffed and overwhelmed), local government (shrunken councils struggling to meet their legal duties) – the baleful legacy of the Cameron administration is clear.



At the Foreign Office, Cameron, mercifully, would have little sway over domestic policy. But his qualifications for this alternative role are hardly stronger.



He became the first prime minister since Lord North in 1782 to lose a vote on a matter of peace and war after failing to make a compelling case for military action in Syria. In the case of Libya, where the UK did intervene, the Foreign Affairs Select Committee ruled in 2016 that Cameron bears much responsibility for the country’s collapse into civil war. “Through his decision-making in the national security council, former prime minister David Cameron was ultimately responsible for the failure to develop a coherent Libya strategy,” it concluded.

In the European sphere, Cameron heedlessly pandered to Tory Europhobia. He withdrew the Conservatives from the mainstream centre-right EU grouping, aligning his party with assorted far-right nationalists and xenophobes.

Though the pledge helped him secure the Tory leadership in 2005, centre-right leaders were appalled by his opportunism and moral relativism. Angela Merkel, the “auntie” who Cameron hoped would come to his rescue during the Brexit negotiations, felt no compulsion to do so. And when he desperately campaigned for Remain in 2016 – having long derided Brussels as a bureaucratic ogre – few sceptics were prepared to believe him.

Once asked why he wanted to become prime minister, Cameron replied “because I think I’d be good at it”. In his desire to become foreign secretary, this toxic combination of complacency and arrogance has once again asserted itself",True,False,False,,0,1541155764,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e8wl7eb,True,t3_9tiy76,False,t3_9tiy76,/r/ukpolitics/comments/9tiy76/david_camerons_desire_to_become_foreign_secretary/e8wl7eb/,,1544899053,64,True,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,r/ukpolitics,public,

Imagine you have a digital map of the globe at a scale of 1 pixel: 1 metre. You also have a time machine that can unerringly geolocate every single human death since 5000 BC or so. So you can now colour in your map with death - the map starts black, and each death lightens that particular pixel a shade.

As you start the process running forward, you can track human migration and the development of civilization as slightly brighter spots show up. As people concentrate in cities, those areas start to become defined. Areas where civilizations develop become lit with hazy clouds - clouds that spread as the global population increases and moves into previously unsettled areas.

Wars, famines, and natural disasters brighten these clouds, but only slightly - the population isn't large enough yet nor dense enough to really brighten the map.

With time, you can start to make out geographical features as the land grows brighter while the sea stays black. Even the arrival of the age of sail only adds a few dim points of light to the utter blackness that is the ocean.

The still-lightening map reveals the successes and failures of humanity. Better living conditions and dropping infant mortality means more people are born. But as all must die someday, these successes in bringing forth life ultimately add light to the map. Nothing makes this as clear as the rise of the Industrial Revolution, which causes a population boom, but also brightens the picture at ever-increasing rates, especially in areas of constant conflict, like Europe. This comes to a head in the 19-teens, when a ribbon of light slashes through France, and large patches of Western Russia start glowing - followed by a general lightening almost everywhere as the 1919 flu epidemic strikes.

But that pales in comparison to the 1940s.

In the 1940s, six points of light, barely a few dozen pixels in size, burst into view. Astonishingly quickly, they surge in intensity and form blazing stars of pure light - so bright that they wash out nearly the entire map. So piercingly brilliant that other blooms over places like Dresden, Tokyo, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki barely register.

The clock keeps running forward to the present day, and the incredible increase in human population - and their subsequent deaths - lighten the map substantially. But notwithstanding, *nothing* can compete with the constellation of horror located in Poland. *Nothing* in human history approaches the sheer density in deaths per metre as those extermination camps.

Simpler breakfasts. Vegan *desis* often just eat derivatives of their lunch/dinner food as breakfast.

Generally vegetarians and vegans end up having lower grocery expenses. A lot of Indians coming to Germany belong in that category due to religious reasons or religio-cultural background, in case of being atheists.

Communal cooking. Regularly pooling money together and cooking large meals for 7-12 people tends to save money in the long run.

There isn't much variety of *halal* eateries in Germany and many of them are at the lower end of the market (e.g.  Döner shops). So Muslim *desis* either don't eat out often or have to spend little in comparison to others.

#Residence
Desis are much more amenable to the idea of living far off from the university and bear long commutes as long as the rent turns out to be cheaper. Many, especially Indians, try to find landlords who are willing to let multiple individual s live in *relatively cramped* accommodation.

#Clothing:
Many bring clothes in bulk from their home countries. Hence, they find little need to buy clothes in Germany. Often they'll just buy a discounted jacket or upper for winter. We also hesitate to buy clothes since our brain automatically converts the price into Rupees.

#Lifestyle/Recreation/Entertainment Expenses:
Minimal for most. I think this category contributes a lot to differences in monthly expenses between *desis* and *non-desis*.  AFAI recall, a lot of users on this and other forums advise that the 720 Euro monthly estimate, implied by the blocked account, is low and students may require upto 200 extra due to lifestyle costs. This extra expense is something my *desi* brain cannot fathom.

Recreation expenses usually just involve an annual or bi-annual *relatively* cheap trip to a neighboring European country.


x----x

We tend to loosen our purse strings after we get a Hiwi or werkstudent position, but only a bit, not something drastic. 

However, even in the South Asian community there is much variation in expenses. While it as a whole is frugal, I have observed that Indians are more extreme in that regard due to the bulk of their incoming students belonging to a lower socio-economic background (vis a vis Pakistani students) and being burdened by student loans.

""I'll just repeat here my ""improved Chinese theory"". I happen to be very probably the only non-native speaker of a language called Sakao. When I learnt it, 30 years ago, it was spoken by some 1000 natives on the island of Espiritu Santo (now Vanuatu, then New Hebrides). The language has two dialects, BTW. It is fairly complicated compared to other Austronesian languages (internal inflections for instance). If I wanted to keep notes which no-one but myself could read, I would merely make up an idiosyncratic alphabet, and write them in Sakao in that alphabet. To crack my code:

1. You need to crack the alphabet. I'd say you can do that only if you have guessed at the language.

2. To guess at the language, you need to know of the existence of Sakao (and its two dialects), AND you need to have sample texts.

3. I won't elaborate further. I'll just say: this code would be uncrackable, short of an extraordinary stroke of luck.

Flash back. I was born in the 16th century, and travelled to China. Or perhaps I was fascinated with languages and met a Hakka-speaking trader or diplomat in Venice, and set about learning Hakka (or Holo, or any of the hundreds of possible candidates). So I am a 16th-century Venitian, the only non-native Hakka speaker in Europe. It is a pretty sure bet that no-one will ever decipher my notes if I write them in Hakka in my own made-up alphabet. Even a Hakka speaker. Would he imagine that these Latin-looking pages are written in his own language?""

""... the language must necessarily be exotic and unrelated with Europe: it may well be that there are (or there were 600 years ago) European languages with a similar reduplication rate.""

I will not argue that there have never been European languages with a similar reduplication rate, but I am quite sure that after the Celtic, Roman, Germanic and Slavic expansions there are no more such languages in Europe. As evidence here's [page 133](https://savepice.ru/full/2018/11/2/e83be04209262266c1a1a9e8af88bfa0-full.png.html) from The World Atlas of Language Structures edited by Martin Haspelmath, Matthew S. Dryer, David Gil, and Bernard Comrie. ([Hungarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_language) being the only exception.) 

Marco, there is no such European language, known in the 15th C, but now lost, which is completely different from all extant European languages!

""... but this doesn't seem that easy in the context of the early XV Century."" A very important objection, to which I will devote a separate post.

Regarding [Romani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_language), it doesn't fit typologically: 1) has inflectional morphology (we need an agglutinative one); 2) doesn't feature ""... as high a reduplication rate as Voynichese"".

In addition, it seems to me that the language which underlies the Voynich manuscript should belong to a developed by the standards of the 15th century people with its own writing system/tradition, i.e. the [Romani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people) doesn't fit culturally.",True,False,False,,0,1541171990,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e8x0b3j,False,t3_9scmlc,True,t1_e8ppbkq,/r/voynich/comments/9scmlc/voynich_manuscript_written_in_balaibalan_language/e8x0b3j/,,1544906113,2,True,False,voynich,t5_2sq24,r/voynich,public,

That's odd, since it was you who suggested that we should ""just wipe us out now honestly"" if we weren't going to expand beyond the solar system. If either of us can be accused of being down on the value of the nice things we have, it isn't me.

&gt; Europe being interested isn't prerequisite to immigrants being interested. It might not benefit Earth, but that doesn't mean it won't benefit immigrants and their descendants.

But that wasn't the question. The question was whether it would be of the sort of benefit that would motivate a civilization to expend resources on it. Human history shows that human civilizations tend not to be so forward-thinkingly charitable that they would expend a significant amount of resources for the benefit of humans they won't know and can't derive any benefit from. Consequently, *even if it were in itself good*, we shouldn't expect humanity to become an extrasolar race, and insofar as our reasons for doing so are grounded in the natural self-interestedness of civilizations that evolution demands of us, we can reasonably extrapolate these reasons to potential intelligent alien life. The conclusion is then that even if alien life exists, we'll never meet it.

Article 2 of the constitution contains no language authorizing the president to extend or deny US citizenship to anyone - so the question remains, will Trump's Originalists remain true to their principles, or are they strictly political hacks?

If the Supreme Court does end up considering an executive order aimed at denying birthright citizenship to children born on US soil to parents not residing legally in the United States, I think the most likely outcome is that the court blocks the order on the basis that the executive possesses no such authority, constitutionally.

We were hungry and figured there were more late night options in the city than out in our area. My friend claimed to know a 24-hr diner he'd been to with his uncle a couple years before, only he mixed up Division and Diversey. So we get off at Division and head East.

We're sitting at a red light behind another car, and realize over to the side that there's a sign reading ""Cabrini Green""! We're sheltered suburban white kids, and we realize we're in the middle of the most notorious, dangerous public housing development in the country after midnight -- and in my Dad's bright red European car. And there were packs of teens/(gang members? drug dealers?) loitering on the corner. That was the longest damn stop light I'd ever sat at. When it finally went green, I floored it, and I just ran through the next red light... eventually we ended up in Old Town and found Mitchell's diner on North &amp; Clark. He'd intended to get us to the Golden Nugget at Diversey &amp; Elston.

Last night, I went to look for baby formula at Target... at the exact same intersection where we sat at that light that night 25 years ago (Division &amp; Larabee).",True,False,False,,0,1541173704,,1541190776,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e8x2gtw,False,t3_9tl14y,False,t3_9tl14y,/r/chicago/comments/9tl14y/am_i_the_only_one_who_confuses_diversey_and/e8x2gtw/,,1544907131,9,True,False,chicago,t5_2qh2t,r/chicago,public,

Da steht nirgendswo, dass es Bereiche der Computer Science gäbe, die nicht im deutschen Begriff Informatik im Deutschen enthalten wären, was du aber behauptest.

EDIT: Just to be sure, because the last Person posting this article did not get the gist of it at all. It talks about the existing differences between informatics and computer science, a difference that mainly exists in the English speaking world, by using the terms in their English sense while describing it in German language.  At no point does that article state that the German word Informatik does not describe Computer Science.

&amp;#x200B;

To bury a great part of this discussion finally and to have something I can link to should this discussion ever arise again: In English the difference between Computer science and informatics is also not that clear cut and exists mainly due to historical reasons.

&gt;The fact that the term Computer Science is used instead of Informatics in the English language has nothing to do with them having different meanings. The terms Informatics (English) and Informatique (French) were each coined separately, by Walter F. Bauer in the USA and Phillipe Dreyfus in France, in the same month of the same year, March 1962. Bauer and Dreyfus were the founders of the companies Informatics General Corporation and Societe pour L’Informatique et Applique, respectively. In France, the term was adopted a few years later as a French word by the Academie française, and, adapted to local languages (Informática, Informatik, etc.), immediately spread across all of Europe. As part of Bauer’s company name, the English term Informatics was, however, protected by American law. This prevented its use (note that the Association for Computing Machinery applied to Bauer for permission to change its name to Society for Informatics and, on the advice of the company’s lawyers, was refused). In the English-speaking world, then, Computer Science or Computing, which were not protected, became popular and are now the terms in common usage. At any rate, when Bauer’s company went out of business, institutions in English-speaking countries, at the University of Edinburgh (UK), Indiana University (USA) or Flinders University (Australia), for example, began to adopt the name of School of Informatics.

Because you have to place in to schools, while the US has said ""No really, *EVERYONE* needs more college. Just take out some loans or something."" When you're only taking A students, you can afford to give everyone a full ride.

&gt;And do you know how many people are not into manual work at all?

I don't think that really matters. If people aren't really in to work then they're welcome to be homeless. 

I also think that's symptomatic of the same problem I've been describing. American primary education has drifted further and further away from doing anything and closer to being daycare. We used to have music, and home ec, and auto shop, and wood shop, and art history, and language classes.

In fact, any comparison of people right of Barack Obama to Nazi's, fascists, is a very poor metaphor rooted in a significant misunderstanding of history.  The metaphor or comparison is made with the belief that fascism is a belief of the political right.  This is made worse when bigoted nuts such as white supremacists and neo-Nazis embrace the comparison.

Fascism was founded by Giovanni Gentile as the path towards successful Socialism.  Gentile argued that a Liberal Democracy, such as the US or various EU countries, is too individualistic and centered on liberty and personal rights.  Gentile argued for what he called ""True Democracy"" in which individuals voluntarily subordinate themselves to the state. Gentile liked to make metaphors comparing government to the family unit, a common though inaccurate, metaphor still in use by leftists. including as the central theme of the 2012 Democratic National Convention. 
 
Gentile was a man of the political left, and a proponent of socialism.  Gentile believed that the only way that state control of the means of production (socialism) could be achieved and be successful was not only by not only appealing to an individuals class, but also requires appealing to one's group identity.  ""Nazi"" is in fact a contraction of ""National Socialist"" which is exactly what fascism is.

Tomayto tomahto. It’s available, easy, free, and illegal.  All I meant to say is that people are more comfortable with and willing to defend piracy over theft.

&gt; Also; the only recent major study done on software piracy actually showed that it increased rather than decreased sales of the pirated products.

I’ve read studies on piracy, yes. It depends on the ubiquity and utility of a product (Photoshop is the software studied in question I believe).

Some people desire software to do work or to operate their computer, and will pirate to do so. Because these services are universal, they get more publicity and become a mainstay through the sheer massive amount of piracy, which does them well.

A study has been done on video game piracy in the EU which showed that it did not affect sales. I have no issues with this study, but I think it’s only relevant for the products they exampled, which, if I remember correctly, were multiplat flagship titles (CoD, Battlefield, etc.) that were released on PC, and not console exclusives dealing with emulation (or PC exclusive indie titles, for that matter). There’s no evidence for or against the idea that Nintendo suffers from piracy.

The best circumstantial/anecdotal evidence that is does (or at least certain kinds of emulation do, I think emulating old/defunct titles helps give them publicity), that I have, is that Nintendo combats piracy. They are either afraid of shareholders thinking that piracy matters, or have done research that shows it does (Not to say Nintendo hasn’t been wrong about this sort of thing before).",True,False,False,,0,1541178861,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e8x93f8,False,t3_9ti3iv,True,t1_e8x2sp7,/r/Games/comments/9ti3iv/super_mario_odyssey_now_playable_start_to_finish/e8x93f8/,,1544910221,3,True,False,Games,t5_2qhwp,r/Games,public,

But then your definition of ""atonal"" is not really atonal.  The scenario you describe could well include pitched elements, even tonal ones.  

For the foreseeable future, ""popular"" music has to be either (a) danceable, or (b) singable, or ideally both.  Otherwise it won't be ""popular"".   (Obviously things may change when we all become robots... ;-))

A non-pitched percussion-only track could easily be danceable, and it's not too hard to imagine such music gaining a big following.  Naturally rap is almost entirely rhythmic, but still currently includes pitched (even tonal) elements.  Even in sub-Saharan Africa, where rhythm is king, people sing, and they sing in a broadly tonal/modal way.  Atonal music which is pitched is hard to sing, at least for the mass of untrained people, so will never be popular for that reason.

IOW, the fact that a lot of pop has an ambiguous tonal centre doesn't mean that atonality is anywhere on the horizon.  It only means that the idea of major and minor keys - that European classical invention - is (maybe) finally, slowly, going out of fashion.  Other forms of popular music around the world tend to be modal, and popular music has been moving in that direction for some decades.  I still wouldn't say that keys will disappear entirely.  Old-fashioned tonality still has plenty of power.

Title: **EU Schengen visa**

Original Post: 

&gt; Got a rejection on my Schengen visa application, under the clause an EU member state objected due to the applicant being a security risk.
&gt; 
&gt; The EU state embassy that I applied to is not allowed to reveal which EU member state issued the objection, but confirmed that it is indeed an objection from a member state and not due to an incomplete application.
&gt; 
&gt; I have contacted the SIS (Schengen Information System) and they don't have me listed in their database. I am currently contacting every EU member state that I have ever visited to check if I am listed in the police national database... so far nothing, my name isn't listed anywhere. 
&gt; 
&gt; I contacted a law firm, and they informed me that they need to check with a third party to give me a consultation on what to do and asked for a 500 USD negotiation fee.
&gt; 
&gt; Am I missing something? Is going member country by member country to figure this out the only way forward to resolve this issue, or could the law firm consultation actually give a better answer?

Expresses concern about these fears and the preparations of his country.

There is a lot of conflict between the coalition parties. The stability of your government is further enhanced by the

From my understanding the whole point of ffp is not to level the playing field as most fans seem to think, it's to prevent clubs to go bankrupt. 

With that in mind, if a big club (one with a large corpus of money to spend, think of it as having a lot of collateral) seems to spend recklessly do you ask it to stop spending or do you limit it's expenditure till it shows sustainable growth.

For a small club on the other hand the risk involved in reckless expenditure is larger than for a big club.

The correct procedure would be to not go to Europe at all. When Czechoslovak refugees fled the country, they waited in refugee camps in Austria until a third country agreed to relocate them. Syrians have safe countries around them - Libanon, Jordan, Turkey. Many people did stay there, some were resettled, some are still there. 

Of course it's understandable that many decided that they will not wait in those not such good conditions and went to look for a better life on their own, but you simply can't say that these people were fleeing for their lives. They were not, their lives were not in danger at that point.

&gt; Well, that is kinda textbook definition of xenophobia.

Well, duh, Czech people are xenophobic. Specially when it comes to muslims. There are some logical reasons behind it. Of course if we are willing to make massive generalizations, we can say that MENA societies are simply very different from the Czech one. So it's logical to worry that immigrants from these countries might find it difficult to integrate. It's also logical to worry about it, given the issues with muslim communities in Western Europe.

Of course this doesn't mean that every single Syria person would make such troubles in CZ. In fact, particulary those from the secular upper class, if they came in small numbers, would likely not cause any issues at all.

But hey, it is, what it is. Unfortunately not only upper secular class of Syrians was coming into Europe.

First, for u/mionni: I am not a fan of stoicism. Way back in my baby-koopzegel days, I studied Classics and Linguistics in university. Which means I spent endless semester hours translating the stoic philosophers (and then the atomists, and then the platonists, and on and on). I love funchords, and think he’s a real smarty-pants, and I don’t begrudge you an intellectual foray into stoicism, but for me, they’re basically whiny, ancient libertarians. They have some interesting ideas, but they’re not my cup of tea. If I never see “the stoic philosophy of Seneca” ever again in my life, it will still be too soon. But, to each his own. I’m just an over/educated booger-snot. But, I feel you on the jobs. I will have something more interesting to say about it tomorrow. I’m still thinking about my job situation, and what exactly is causing the hang up. 

Second, I need a MFP expert! So, I enter my weight in there every day (after I do so in happy scale), because it needs to know how much I weigh in order for it’s calorie-math-magic to work. Well, spouse and I were having a talk about calories, and we both set our MFP to “maintenance” (mostly because it made our past few months look like utter glorious green bars of daily nutrition, instead of the hodge-podge of calming green punctuated with angry red columns every once in a while that it currently is). Well, I entered my weight this morning (115.whatever, it’s been stuck there for days), and played around with my “goals” (changing it from “lose 0.8 kgs per week” to “maintain my weight”). Then, the fun was over, and I switched it back to “lose 0.8kgs per week. And then you know what happened?! MFP DROPPED MY CALORIE COUNT! From 1560/day to 1520! What gives?!?!? I didn’t update a new weight or anything! Isn’t the point of entering weight in MFP to let it know when to drop your calories? Weirdly enough, it did it to both me and spouse (she’s within 5kgs of me, in terms of weight, although she is a few centimeters taller). We both had 1560 daily allowances that got dropped down to 1520 by the capricious will of the MFP app! ...Should I be fooling around with the “goals” section more often? Do I have to pay attention to MFP to make sure it adjusts my calories as I’m losing weight? Why is this suddenly so confusing??

Anyway, onto my day: 

Calories: 1407/1520, although I know I’m going to have a 200 calorie snack that I really want before I sleep, so a little over. It’s ok. I really wanted it. I knew what I was doing. 

Dutch: got my Duolingo in.

You have completely misunderstood my comment - though I probably wasn't clear enough. I am agreeing that most people wish to be around others that are similar to them. But I am arguing that those people will not necessarily be white English people.

I live in Belgium but I have as little in common with the Belgian toffs and working classes as I have with English toffs and working classes (very broadly speaking). However through my work I get to meet people from all around the world who share my interests and values - this is *my* group. 

Interestingly some on the right (and far-right) have also paradoxically cottoned on to this, and they are working both globally and Europe-wide to build organisations that represent their values. For example, there are many right-wing parties in Europe that are Eurosceptic. More hardline leave voters would have a lot to discuss with the people in those parties - and probably many values in common too.

Un danger pour les doctorants, de plus en plus précaires, et pour l’université elle-même, en tant qu’institution.**



&gt;**Tribune.** Les sciences humaines et sociales sont essentielles à une société. Elles permettent de trouver des réponses aux questions qui surviennent sans cesse, de régénérer les savoirs, d’assurer leur transmission, d’en garder la mémoire. Cependant, nous assistons à une dévalorisation progressive de ce champ du savoir, avec des conséquences néfastes à long terme. L’effectif des doctorants est en baisse continue depuis dix ans, avec -21% de doctorants en sciences de la société et -13% en sciences humaines et humanités. Il se trouve que ce sont également les disciplines les moins financées. Une majorité écrasante de doctorants (70%) ne bénéficie pas d’un contrat doctoral les reliant à l’institution à laquelle ils appartiennent.

&gt;Ces jeunes chercheurs doivent acheter le temps consacré à leurs thèses par le biais d’un autre travail. Ils ne travaillent plus pour s’assurer une existence, mais pour pouvoir travailler. Ils sont, en dehors des laboratoires, des amphithéâtres et des colloques, serveurs, surveillants de lycée, bibliothécaires, baby-sitters, enseignants à domicile, guides touristiques. Plus tragique encore, 10% des doctorants, toute disciplines confondues, n’ont aucune activité rémunérée. Il s’agit de presque 7 500 jeunes chercheurs en France.

&gt;**Les doctorants et le travail gratuit**

&gt;Ce que les statistiques ignorent c’est l’immensité de chaque monde individuel. Ce type de travail «à côté» empêche toute projection vers le futur, car il est sans lien avec la recherche. Les études sociologiques lui opposent le travail d’anticipation. Mais les jeunes chercheurs s’inscrivant dans cette dernière catégorie n’ont pas un meilleur sort. A titre d’exemple, ceux qui assurent une charge de cours à l’université en tant que vacataires sont payés à l’heure, pour un salaire annuel qui équivaut, dans le meilleur des cas, à deux ou trois mois de smic. Même dans ce dernier cas, il arrive trop souvent qu’on ne leur fasse pas signer de contrat. Ils se voient ainsi dans l’impossibilité de fournir une preuve formelle quant à la réalité de leur travail. Ils ne peuvent enseigner qu’à titre secondaire et sont obligés d’avoir un emploi «principal». Ils cumulent ainsi trois activités professionnelles : le travail de recherche (gratuit), l’enseignement (deux ou trois mois de smic par an) et un emploi principal (précaire).

&gt;Cette situation est permise par le flou dans les textes de loi concernant le doctorat. D’un côté, les jeunes chercheurs sont considérés comme des étudiants, de l'autre le doctorat est reconnu comme étant une expérience professionnelle. C’est le détail qui ouvre la voie royale vers la précarité. Ce qui est particulier à la situation des doctorants c’est que l’écart entre l’âge social et l’âge biologique est très important. Non seulement ils ne bénéficient plus d’aucun avantage «jeune» (bourses sur critères sociaux, logements, réductions), mais ce statut les exclut également de la plupart des droits sociaux. Si les contractuels sont considérés comme des salariés, par rapport à un même type de travail de recherche les non-contractuels sont des étudiants. Autrement dit, leur travail est gratuit et bénévole.

&gt;Le travail d’un doctorant n’est pas uniquement un investissement de forces et ressources personnelles dans une activité par le biais de laquelle il ou elle se réalise individuellement, il est également une réalisation collective. C’est l’université elle-même, en tant qu’institution, qui se réalise à travers son travail. Un exemple concret concerne ce que le ministère de l'Enseignement supérieur, de la Recherche et de l'Innovation appelle la «production scientifique». Quand on évalue la performance d’une université, on regarde le nombre de publications. Combien d’articles ont été écrits par des jeunes chercheurs-étudiants et combien le seront encore ?

&gt;**La reproduction des inégalités**

&gt;La recherche est aujourd’hui évaluée en termes de production et de performance. Dans cette logique de capitalisme académique, le doctorant doit terminer sa thèse le plus rapidement possible et être productif. Plus il s’attarde sur son doctorat, moins il publie, plus il se dirige vers les marges du système. Mais sa production et sa performance sont conditionnées par les ressources disponibles, ce qui trace un premier cercle vicieux. Indifféremment du contenu de la thèse, des arguments défendus dans le travail de recherche ou de la qualité de ce travail, dans ce type de système il n’y a «pas de vérité sans argent», comme le notait déjà Lyotard dans la Condition postmoderne. Ceux qui ont eu des ressources auront raison de leur vérité car elle pèsera plus sur le marché du travail et sur le marché des biens symboliques, tandis que le précariat verra ses vérités diminuées par ce même marché.

&gt;De nombreuses études indiquent que l’accès aux ressources dépend des éléments comme l’origine sociale, la nationalité ou le sexe. En France, presque la moitié des doctorants (41%) est de nationalité étrangère. Une diversité qui pourrait entraîner une immense effervescence intellectuelle. Mais ils sont encore plus touchés par la précarité et ont bien moins de chances de se voir attribuer un contrat. Les raisons sont multiples : absence de capital social, manque de familiarité au régime des concours, rareté des ressources. En ce qui concerne la parité dans la recherche, en 2015, les femmes représentaient 27% des chercheurs. Quand les ressources sont rares, on favorise les acteurs qui savent se plier au mieux au savoir et à l’ordre dominant. Dans une logique de marché, la compétition accroît les inégalités et encourage le conformisme. L’université, au lieu de se régénérer en permanence en permettant l’invention, le renouveau et les divergences critiques, se pétrifie.

&gt;Les sciences humaines et sociales ont un rôle primordial dans une société démocratique. Elles pensent le progrès et empêchent les dérives. Elles sont les garants d’un équilibre sain entre des forces critiques contraires. Elles sont l’expression même de la démocratie et le révélateur de l’état de santé d’une société. La précarité dans les sciences humaines et sociales atteint gravement à cet équilibre présent et futur. La contractualisation à terme de tous les jeunes chercheurs est l’unique mesure capable de diminuer les inégalités causées et perpétuées par le sous-financement dans ces disciplines. Quand l’université repose sur un travail gratuit, invisible, aliéné, ce sont ses propres forces qu’elle s’aliène.

False,theinspectorst,1376747479.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_csift,False,"I'd argue that's an oversimplified and incorrect narrative for the UK.

During the recession, *everyone* supported counter-cyclical fiscal expansion. The UK's budget deficit increased by around 7 percentage points of GDP during the recession, from 3% in 2007 to 10% in 2009, with broad-based support across all three parties, on the back of an increase in government spending in same two-year period from 38% of GDP to 44% of GDP. That was a very significant deficit-financed stimulus.

The Coalition came into government afterwards, when the UK was recovering. This also coincided with a European debt crisis; the Coalition was literally formed in the weeks after the first Greek bailout and the months before the Irish bailout. These were difficult volatile times for European sovereign debt.

The Coalition therefore set an early objective to begin a gradual fiscal consolidation in the UK, such that the public finances would be in a fit state to react next time there was a crisis. It's easier to do counter-cyclical fiscal policy when your public finances start in good shape but I would not particularly like to see the UK going into the next crisis with debt-to-GDP starting out around 80%, where it stands now.

The gradualist nature of what the Coalition sought to do also gets drowned out by the British left and certain Americans like Krugman. They paint a picture of a front-loaded 'slashing' of public spending, whereas the reality is that, 8 years in to our fiscal consolidation, government spending has still not quite fallen to its pre-crisis 38% share of GDP.

The Coalition also had a longer-term mission with respect to the public finances though, which is to resolve the structural deficit that the Labour government was running pre-crisis. Improbably, we were running a series of *pro-cyclical* budget deficits at the top of the bubble, of around 3% a year during 2005-2007. That was inexcusable and based on an arrogant belief by the then-Chancellor of the Exchequer that he had personally ended the business cycle (a claim he made repeatedly), so he could merrily increase government spending hand-in-hand with bubble-era tax receipts in the expectation they would continue forever.

If we'd gone in to the recession running a surplus instead of a 3% deficit, we could have achieved the same 7 percentage point fiscal shift by running a much smaller deficit, allowing future governments more options on how and when to reduce it.

But modern events demonstrate that simply isn't true .. the sport is harder than ever now, and championship gymnasts are older and more developed than they ever were in the past. 

But what really happened was that the military-type training of Eastern Europe that worked so well early on only worked on prepubescent girls. The 9hrs/day, 6days a week, working out on broken legs training caused many little girls to fail but made it damn near impossible for an actual woman to compete. 

I remember girls in the 90s leaving Bela Karoyli's gym because after puberty they said their bodies just couldn't take the pounding and the yelling/screaming .. they'd be failing in Bela's gym, but then leave and go to a female coach and then magically they'd be at a more competitive level than they were in Bela's gym 

The coolest thing about this modern era is older gymnasts showing that the 9hrs/day shit isn't necessary. Simone Biles doesn't do the repetitions that the other girls do .. she does significantly fewer reps. The coaching techniques have changed.

GRIPA insa este o boala care trasmite pe cale aeriana. Fie ca tu nu iesi decat pana la mega sau pana in scara blocului. 

E foarte posibil sa nu stii acest lucru: un virus rezista in aer pana la 2 h. Pe suprafete chiar mai mult. Nu ai de unde sa stii cum sau cand il iei. Efectiv nu ai cum.

&gt;Cât despre mutațiile tulpinilor, trebuie să fii naivă să crezi că acestea suferă mutații semnificative doar vara când sunt în vacanță, asta se poate întâmpla prin câteva pasaje succesive, care se produc lejer din noiembrie până prin martie (să zicem).

Eu am senzatia ca ma iei peste picior. Nu e vorba doar de schimbarea pe timpul verii, era doar un exemplu, cat e vorba de schimbarea pe termen mai lung.

Evident, exista si mutatii fix in mijlocul sezonului, cum s-a intamplat in 2016-2017, cu o tulpina neacoperita de vaccin. Anul trecut insa s-a facut un vaccin tetravalent care sa acopere si acest tip de tulpina. Nu am pretins niciodata ca e un vaccin perfect, insa necesitatea lui ramane (Ba din pacate pot spune ca e un vaccin care are o acoperire chiar f mica, dar este o sansa in plus la viata). 
Inclusiv la persoanele sanatoase, care nu merg in zonele aglomerate. Ca ma indoiesc ca pana in luna mai stai inchis in casa, nevizitat de nimeni. Daca da, atunci gripa ar fi cea mai mica problema a ta, intr-adevar.

I was mistaken in what I thought the classification of Sephardic; I had thought that the classification included the Mizrahi, which I have now learned is a separate thing. So, I apologise for the misinformation, and thanks for the opportunity to correct something I was wrong in believing.
Logically speaking, there's a big difference between (paraphrasing here, I'm using my phone and can't see exactly what you said) ""Jews are just whites"" versus ""the typical European/American Jew is [...] white.""
Also ""Ashkenazi"" is specifically used to refer to Jews of proximal European origin, so European Jews would be Ashkenazi by definition.

Thing is, Jews come from a lot of different places, and though the most commonly pictured ""Jew"" is white, that's a bit like saying that the typical Christian in the US is Protestant. While true, there are still a significant number of Christians who are of different denominations.

Daca racesti des poti interveni in stilul de viata pt a creste imunitatea si eventual poti lua suplimente tip zinc daca situatia e asa serioasa. Aparent zincul luat in 24 de h de la debutul racelii ar putea sa ajute cu simptomele. Si mai bine daca e luat din timp. Sa zicem. E o chestie variabila asta insa. Fiecare reactioneaza diferit la raceli, cu sau fara ajutor medicamentos.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15496046

Daca racelile sunt ceva mai grav de un stranut si guturai (adica raceli care se prelungesc mai mult de 10-14 zile) atunci poate problema e alta. O tuse cu expectoratie de culori anormale (verde, galbena), daca mai apare si o otita sau alte minunatii pe langa, atunci nu ar fi rau sa investighezi cand apar acestea, ca sa nu aiba alte cauze (adica sa nu fie de fapt virale, ci bacteriene). Sau sa nu incepi printr-o raceala si apoi sa culegi si alte minunatii cat esti racit, deci sa faci suprainfectii. Pneumococul este un exemplu des intalnit si exista un vaccin pt 13 din cele mai des intalnite  tulpini. Dar vaccinul apara in principiu de complicatii, nu previne infectia cu totul.

Ce mai recomand eu celor care fac suprainfectii, e sa discute cu medicul de familie despre imunomodulatoare. Eu de ex am apelat la Broncho vaxom (altele ar fi Robmunyl, Luivac) ca nu mai reuseam sa ies din boli.

Acestea sunt un fel de ""vaccinuri"" orale, cu bacterii liofizilate, care se iau sub forma de capsule. Bineinteles, la indicatia medicului, daca e necesar. Nu pot sa repet asta suficient. Ce spun eu acum e doar o recomandare, nu o indicatie. 

Tot pe principiul asta al bacteriilor liofilizate s-a mers cand s-a facut Polidinul. Numai ca ala nu era tocmai cel mai sigur produs, nefiind testat suficient.

People wondering why Dončić is so talked about? I will summarise:

He is a hyped, exciting player who is performing up to expectation and is arguably the best performing rookie.

He is also European, and Americans do not trust European players because of players like Bargani and Darko Miličić. So like with Porziņģis him living up to the hype also surprises some. 

Being European he also has many European's rooting for him, particularly those of us from the former Yugoslav countries.

A cultural means of recording miracles (i.e., a historical record) imposes an obvious limit on the miracles we have access to. But even within that historical record we should not expect miracles to be too frequent or too obvious—with very rare exceptions—because of [the importance of divine hiddenness to moral liberty.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThroughAGlassDarkly/comments/6gzgcv/6_the_higher_order_goods_solution_to_the_problem/)

I argue there is [surprisingly good historical evidence for the Resurrection of Jesus](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThroughAGlassDarkly/comments/6n9uwd/31_the_resurrection_of_jesus/). 

Looking at the time and place this occurred, we see a remarkable convergence of fortuitous historical factors. 

As I argue [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThroughAGlassDarkly/comments/6gzuai/21_swinburnes_a_priori_argument_for_the/),

&gt;Given the amount of pain and suffering which God, [though for a good purpose](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThroughAGlassDarkly/comments/6gzg44/5_the_higherorder_goods_solution_to_the_problem/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=ThroughAGlassDarkly&amp;utm_content=t3_6nvjm5), permits us to endure it is very plausible to suppose that he incurs a moral obligation upon himself to share in that suffering; and given that God, being perfectly good, always performs the morally best available action, it is very plausible to suppose that he would discharge that obligation. This could be achieved by means of an incarnation; that is, by becoming human and, “living a life containing much suffering and ending with the great crisis which all humans have to face: the crisis of death.” And one way to ensure that he has shared in the very worst suffering humans must endure is to live a life that ends in a brutal and unjustly imposed execution.

The point is, in order to share in the very worst of our suffering God Incarnate needed to choose a time and place where claiming truthfully to be God Incarnate would lead to a brutal death: First century Judea is one such place.

Look, next, at a timeline of Earth's population, and you will see that this alleged event occurred *just* before [a massive spike in population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_overpopulation#/media/File:Population_curve.svg); in a place at the centre of the ancient world with an existing system of Roman roads; and therefore reached Europe just in time for the discovery of the New World. 

It was the optimal location and time for a message to spread worldwide.

To reply to this,

&gt;Putting the alleged Resurrection of Jesus to one side for a moment, if miracles happen at all, they should happen more often. Therefore, it is unlikely that Jesus was raised from the dead.

is, finally, a very weak counterargument.

Just because everyone does it, doesn't make it ok. If you are speeding 150% unintentionally you are doing something seriously wrong.

&gt;you could lose track of your speed if nobody else is on the road

Lets exclude the obvious excuse of poor road signage for a moment. It's not nearly as prevalent as people make it out to be.
In any case, when you are driving you are obligated to pay attention to all traffic signage and that includes speed indication. If you don't notice it, your at fault.

While I agree it happens to everyone including me. Still not ok. If you don't know what the current speed limit is at all times you where not focusing enough.

Al-Khelaïfi en profite pour réclamer que le montant de l’amende reste confidentiel. « Nous refuserons que l’UEFA annonce le montant et que notre club soit moins bien traité que les autres », écrit-il à Infantino. Pour l’émirat, être sanctionné, même a minima, est une humiliation.

L’affaire remonte au plus haut niveau. Le 11 mai, Blanc appelle Infantino et le « top guy ». Le lendemain, Platini rappelle : le PSG perd sur la publication de l’amende, mais obtient le même deal que Manchester City. L’amende ferme est réduite de 60 à 20 millions d’euros.

Le PSG en veut cependant toujours plus. En Ligue des champions, un club peut aligner 25 joueurs, dont 8 formés dans son pays. Le PSG râle très fort. Et Michel Platini accepte de faire approuver par le comité exécutif de l’UEFA une interprétation des règles, qui limite à 5 le nombre de joueurs formés au pays lorsqu’un club ne peut en aligner que 21.

Bref, l’UEFA cède sur presque tout, ce qui crée visiblement un gros malaise. Le 28 avril 2014, son directeur juridique rédige des éléments de langage : « L’accord amiable n’est en aucune façon un embarras ou une capitulation vis-à-vis du PSG », puisque le Qatar et Abou Dhabi auraient « accepté de se soumettre aux règles du fair-play financier ».

La suite du document est une leçon de réalisme sur les rapports de force dans le foot. Exclure de la Ligue des champions « certains des plus gros clubs et des plus grands joueurs du monde » ne serait pas bon pour le business : « Il faut être raisonnable et essayer de trouver des solutions qui ne nuisent pas à la qualité » de la compétition. « Et il faut raisonnablement reconnaître à qui on a affaire. On parle de clubs (PSG et Manchester City) détenus par des États-nations, qui ne sont pas habitués à changer leur façon de faire du business pour respecter les règles d’une organisation de football comme l’UEFA. » Tout est dit.

Puisque le business passe avant tout, les cadeaux continuent. Un an plus tard, fin mai 2015, Jean-Claude Blanc est furieux. L’UEFA lui a confié une information confidentielle : Manchester City, sanctionné lui aussi pour deux ans en mai 2014, a obtenu que ses sanctions soient levées un an à l’avance, c’est-à-dire immédiatement. « Manchester City est libre d’investir de nouveau sur le marché. […] Ça expliquerait pourquoi ils discuteraient avec la Juventus d’un transfert de Pogba pour 100 millions d’euros avec 12 millions de salaire net par an pour le joueur », fulmine Blanc dans un mail à Al-Khelaïfi. À nouveau, l’honneur du Qatar est en jeu.

Blanc réclame illico le même traitement que le club d’Abou Dhabi. Infantino est gêné : seule la chambre d’instruction a normalement le pouvoir de modifier un accord amiable. Le 19 juin, Nasser Al-Khelaïfi écrit une lettre furibarde à Michel Platini : il menace d’attaquer en justice la légalité du fair-play financier.

Ça marche. Dans les jours qui suivent, Infantino et Blanc élaborent un nouvel arrangement. L’accord de mai 2014 prévoyait que le contrat QTA valait zéro euro pour le passé ? Peu importe. Infantino autorise le PSG à réécrire a posteriori ses comptes afin de valoriser le contrat QTA à 100 millions d’euros dès 2013-2014. Le PSG revient ainsi à l’équilibre un an à l’avance, et les sanctions peuvent être levées sans que l’accord soit modifié.

Cette solution acrobatique est validée le 2 juillet 2015 par le président de la chambre d’instruction, Umberto Lago, au motif que le PSG « a signé un nouveau contrat » avec QTA, qui accorde à l’office du tourisme du Qatar « de nouveaux droits de sponsoring substantiels et exclusifs ». C’est faux. Le PSG a seulement envoyé à l’UEFA, fin 2014, une version préliminaire et non signée du nouveau contrat. Ce document ne sera paraphé que deux ans plus tard…

Autre étrangeté : le nouveau contrat ne s’élève pas à 100 millions par an, mais à 155, puis 145 millions, car c’est le montant dont le PSG a besoin pour atteindre l’équilibre et passer les contrôles de la DNCG, le gendarme financier de la ligue française de football. Par contre, seuls 100 millions seront pris en compte par l’UEFA dans le calcul du fair-play financier. Là encore, la fédération européenne ne moufte pas.

C’est d’autant plus surprenant que si le contrat est passé de 5 à 66 pages, le PSG n’a pas accordé les nouveaux droits « substantiels et exclusifs » pourtant exigés par l’UEFA pour valoriser le contrat à 100 millions par an. QTA n’a obtenu qu’une loge privative de 15 places au Parc des Princes, d’une valeur de 150 000 euros par an, et un déplacement de l’équipe chaque hiver à Doha pour y disputer un match amical, baptisé « Qatar Winter Tour ».

Même ces engagements minimalistes ne sont pas tenus. Comme si le PSG prenait un malin plaisir à humilier QTA, son plus gros pourvoyeur de fonds.

Le 30 octobre 2014, sur ordre personnel de Nasser Al-Khelaïfi, QTA se voit retirer arbitrairement 10 de ses 15 sièges en loge, sans même un courrier d’explication. « Ça a eu un impact important sur nos activités commerciales », se plaint QTA au PSG, en réclamant une confirmation officielle de cette décision.

Deux semaines plus tard, le PSG organise son « Qatar Winter Tour » 2014, avec un match amical de prestige contre l’Inter de Milan à… Marrakech, au Maroc, en violation du contrat avec QTA.

La encore, l’Autorité touristique du Qatar proteste : « Le Maroc n’est pas un marché cible pour nous, donc appeler [le match] Qatar Winter Tour ne nous apporte pas vraiment de bénéfices. » QTA demande que les références au Qatar soient retirées des communiqués offciels, car « il s’agit de la marque d’une tournée au Qatar, elle ne peut pas être attachée à un match qui se joue en dehors du Qatar ». Mais le PSG est inflexible et QTA ne se plaindra plus, même lorsque le PSG organise son Qatar Winter Tour 2016 en Tunisie. En dépit des 145 millions d’euros que QTA lui verse par an.

Les sponsors qataris du PSG (passer la souris sur les blocs pour afficher les chiffres) © Donatien Huet / Mediapart Et qui ne suffisent pas à assurer l’énorme train de vie du PSG. Gianni Infantino a, on s’en souvient, autorisé le PSG en avril 2014 à compenser la baisse du contrat QTA avec de nouveaux sponsors qataris. Le club ne s’en est pas privé, avant même que le numéro 2 de l’UEFA ne donne son feu vert.

Ces contrats sont aussi étranges que celui signé avec QTA. Il y a d’abord leurs montants très généreux, entre 4 et 20 millions par an. Comme tous les clubs, le PSG tient ses plus gros contrats de son sponsor maillot Emirates et de son équipementier Nike qui versent chacun autour de 20 millions par an. Des montants logiques, puisque tous deux sont très bien exposés, sur le devant du maillot.

En revanche, pour les autres sponsors, les prix sont beaucoup plus faibles. Ainsi, Orange, troisième partenaire non qatari du PSG, ne paie que 1,5 million par an. À des années-lumière de ce que versent les sponsors de l’émirat.

Autre incongruité : la plupart des contrats qataris sont à effet rétroactif, ce qui revient pour les sponsors à payer en partie pour rien. La palme revient à la chaîne beIN Sports : son accord de sponsoring du club, signé en septembre 2013 pour 2,8 millions d’euros par an, couvre la saison 2012-2013, qui s’est pourtant terminée trois mois plus tôt.

Avec beIN Sports, qui sponsorise le club, le conflit d’intérêts est évident. Nasser Al-Khelaïfi, président du PSG, dirige aussi beIN Sports et QSI (Qatar Sport Investments), le propriétaire des deux entreprises. Lorsque le contrat est signé, il pourrait signer pour les deux entités. Il est donc demandé à Jean-Claude Blanc de le faire côté PSG.

Par ailleurs, depuis mars 2012, QSI loue au club pour 2,7 millions d’euros par an l’intégralité des 239 sièges de la tribune présidentielle du Parc des Princes, transformée en outil de relations publiques, où le Qatar invite les VIP et les stars de passage à Paris. Le montant est passé à 6 millions par an à l’été 2015. Soit 25 000 € le siège, deux fois plus que ce qui est facturé à d’autres clients du PSG.

Le contrat avec l’académie qatarie de football Aspire passe quant à elle de 1,5 à 5,5 millions par an à l’été 2014, et celui avec beIN Sports de 2,8 à 3,9 millions. Idem pour QNB, la banque nationale du Qatar. Au printemps 2013, les négociations pour renouveler le contrat sont rudes, QNB ne voulant pas aller au-delà de 3 millions par an. Mais la banque accepte subitement en septembre d’en payer 15, en échange de son logo sur la manche des maillots.",True,False,False,,0,1541205267,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e8y6hbz,True,t3_9tprq2,True,t1_e8y6gjg,/r/psg/comments/9tprq2/dopage_financier_platini_et_infantino_ont_couvert/e8y6hbz/,,1544925817,1,True,False,psg,t5_2tbky,r/psg,public,

Allied atrocities should be remember but there were not committed as part of a systematic campaign to exterminate the German people, as the Nazi atrocities were.  

Whether you look at it from a numerical or an intentional perspective, Nazi crimes were objectively worse. By a very generous estimate some 2.5 million German civilians were killed as a result of Allied action during and after WWII – strategic bombing, the occupation, and the post-war expulsions. Compare this to a common estimate of 15-16 million Soviet civilians killed as a result of German action. Add another 5-6 million from the Holocaust and that's 20 million civilians murdered by Nazi Germany – 8 times as many as a generous estimate of German civilian casualties. And that's not even including civilians of other countries killed during the Nazi occupations.  

Morally, Nazi Germany was waging an ideological campaign of conquest and genocide to systematically exterminate the Jewish and Slavic peoples of Europe. The Allies were fighting first to repulse the German invasions and then to dismantle the genocidal apparatus of the Nazi regime. I truly hope you understand that distinction.  

""The Russian occupation of Germany was arguably worse than the German invasion of Russia"" is a morally indefensible statement no matter how you slice it.

Germany has regulated prostitution

Spain has done none of those things

Regulate means legalize. In Spain pimping is supposedly ilegal but the reality is that there are more brothels  than ever. Some political parties (from the ""left"" and right) want to regulate prostitution meaning legalize pimps and turn them into respectable businessmen.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Owning an establishment where prostitution takes place is in itself legal, but the owner cannot derive financial gain from the prostitute or *hire* a person to sell sex because prostitution is not considered a job and thus has no legal recognition. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution\_in\_Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution_in_Spain)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;What *is* totally illegal is a public solicitation for sex, also known as ""street prostitution."" Both the sex worker and his or her client can be prosecuted in some parts of Spain, including Barcelona for soliciting sexual acts in public. Additionally, pimping is expressly illegal in the country, but Catalonia provides government permits ""to gather people to practice prostitute.""

Barcelona is a city with a lot of tourism and its mayor has advocated for the regularization of prostitution.

&amp;#x200B;

From wikipedia

&gt;Local governments differ in their approaches to both indoor and outdoor prostitution, usually in response to community pressure groups, and based on 'public safety'. Most places do not regulate prostitution, but the government of Catalonia offers licenses for persons ""to gather people to practice prostitution"". These licenses are used by brothel owners to open 'clubs', where prostitution takes place (the women are theoretically only 'gathered' to work on the premises not employed by the owner).

But we certainly weren't ""isolationist"". We interfered in Latin America all the damn time, especially after the Spanish American war in 1898.

Know that words are interpreted multiple ways and style dictates subtleness which is often favored. Liberals tend to take words literally to back the ideal hidden in the literal interpretation, I think because of some fundamental difference in humans that causes some people to favor the emotional elation from certain beliefs.

For example I truly think the words on the statue of liberty need to be understood in context and with subtleness. In my opinion, it tells us a story of accepting potentially beneficial citizens because we recognize European society had turned a back on talent and pushed many great people into poverty in favor of tradition. It does not say ""fuck it, blindly give us anyone.""

If you do research, founding fathers well agreed that immigration must be beneficial or it will hurt us, almost tautalogical. Beneficial meaning, looking at hard facts, if new people eat more than they produce, we will be in the negative. 

Back to modern liberals and conservatives and middle grounds. There are liberals who desire to just take any immigrants for any reason, quoting the statue of liberty. Many conservatives just want strong vetting so we know it will be beneficial. Many democrats want the same.

Really what are we arguing about? Looking at radical conservatives while ignoring the equally sized radical liberals?

My point is for people who are saying they are liberal, think we are going in the wrong direction, know that most are middle ground.

Yup there is your problem.You are literally friends with terrorists.Definition of terrorism isn't done by you and  ""until someone is willing to give terrorists what they want"" does definitely not make people freedom fighters.PKK is a terrorist organization by definition and they are a designated terrorist organization by the US (You can check it on FTO list of state.gov) and [EU,Canada,Australia etc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_designated_terrorist_groups) and nothing you say or think can change that.We're talking of an organization that burns hospitals and schools,murders construction workers (Mostly local Kurdish) and anyone who works in a school,hospital etc..An organization that raids villages and mass murders people who don't provide them food and shelter.An organization that murders civillians in various cities with bomb attacks.An organization that burns civillians to death with molotov cocktails.I'm not making any of this up or exaggerating you can find out about these on the internet yourself and I can provide you with sources for all of these if you can't manage to find,I have personally witnessed some of these happening.

If you actually want to gain information and learn about this topic,go read and watch something that is not from straight up terrorists.You can go read pro ISIS sites and talk to people in ISIS and they will tell you that they are love spreading butterflies and they are freedom fighters because they don't have democratic alternative provided for them.If you just want to act like you know about shit to sound like you're pro human rights or sth,go ahead who am I to tell you to stop.",True,False,False,,0,1541224058,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e8ymyt7,False,t3_9tmiqw,True,t1_e8ylm13,/r/news/comments/9tmiqw/khashoggi_body_dissolved_in_acid/e8ymyt7/,,1544933525,1,True,False,news,t5_2qh3l,r/news,public,

Sort of a sensory overload a bit but did the rounds and got to meet some a bunch of fountain pen famous people like the Brian dude from Edison who everyone kept correcting me as being Brian Gray rather than Brian Edison, Richard Binder who seemed to know a bunch about pens but again really didn't live up to the name as the closest thing he had was a whole folio of Platinum Pocket Pens (turns out I shouldn't have said pocket pen, he had a whole bunch of them), the Andersens from Andersen Pens who at least were smart enough require their employees to change their last name to Andersen, and a host of other amazing people which was really just a Turkish dude who had pens that looked older than Miley Cyrus and classier than her four Loko photo shoot.

Picked up some inks from Wahl Eversharp which was nice, so rodeo notebooks, a fountain pen (seemed like a good idea and I hadn't got a new fountain pen since opening the mail this morning so that was long overdue), along with a couple of other small items. Mr. Binder tuned up a couple of pens for me which was awesome.

Anywho, near way out ran into dude named Tim who had a note about coffee on his name tag. Told him I could go for a coffee. He said he was like the official coffee service for it or something to that effect. Didn't have any coffee that I could drink which is ironic that he was right by the guy selling acrylic bars. Just what I need, not yet fountain pens and not ready to drink coffee. We talked shop about coffee roasting which was pretty cool and the coffee smelled really good. Didn't get home until after my coffee cutoff and was already yawning from the two cups at the hotel bar (both excellent) and the cup at Wendy's (burger place from Columbus, also has a really good Asiago Bacon Chicken Sandwich if you're vegan). I think photo has the name of coffee place and name of coffee. He said it was his most popular roast he does and I can totally see why. I love free coffee.

Slightly disappointed no one could ID my pen. Austrian dude everyone said would know. He didn't and kind of scoffed at it and told me to sell it. Told him I kind of liked it so he fixed me up on filling system with was wild to watch and a little nerve wracking as the pen cost me more than Safari and a box of ink cartridges. Thanked him profusely and my friend suggested I ask the nib guy (Binder) to tune it up since it was not perfect by any means. Turkish gentleman kind of scoffed and pulled the nib out and worked some voodoo on it. Said it was good to go. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ saw a really cool pen that was super shiny which he kept saying wasn't a master strike but had some fancy European pronunciation.

Showed off my Lamy Safari Lilac I put a gold nib on because when you go to one of these shows you want to stand out from the crowd and nothing says unique like a Limited Edition Safari. People immediately noticed that it didn't have its original nib which made me a little worried that it is going to harm its resale value. They said it wrote nice which I think could have been just partially seeing someone roll in with a pen of such distinction and having that mental preconception that a pen is nicer just because it's a rare limited edition. You know how pen people are.

No point unless you have a Chinese rifle and want some to match. Apex has European steel surplus magazines for a $12 fairly regularly, $12-$15 is pretty normal now for steel surplus. Also Whatacountry and armsofamerica (to name a couple) also tend to be well stocked on steel surplus mags.

These are out of stock right now but they seem to come back in stock fairly frequently:

and

Also as far as ammo goes, avoid Tula, it's super dirty but more importantly it's under-powered and inconsistent. Also some wolf brand stuff sucks pretty bad too. The pinnacle of steel case 7.62x39 is going to be your Golden tiger (Vympel factory in Russia) and any rebranded Barnaul stuff (Monarch at Academy, Brown Bear, etc). A one stop shop for 7.62x39 ammo online is going to be sgammo.

Some of the Century Arms ""red army standard"" stuff is okay, like their current lot of import from Vympel (theoretically should be the same stuff as Golden Tiger). Another quality option is the Wolf ""mil-spec"" with the green lacquered case and red sealant around the case mouth and primer.

Generally for any sort of long term storage you want steel cased stuff with the green lacquer (the case will look green), and ideally on top of that, some sort of red, purple, green, etc sealant around the case/mouth/bullet and also the primer (this is how the military stuff we can't import anymore came).",True,False,False,,0,1541228797,,1541229218,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e8ypn4q,False,t3_9trzfh,True,t1_e8yp8hf,/r/ak47/comments/9trzfh/hello_rak47_im_new_to_reddit_and_to_the_platform/e8ypn4q/,,1544934771,1,True,False,ak47,t5_2rj35,r/ak47,public,

&gt;it's not that a white guy can't dress up as Prince, but to have the costume include skin color kind of reduces Prince to his skin color

People are reduced to their skin colour if they're a flat character because of it. For example, maybe a character looks different because they're a foreigner. That doesn't mean they're utterly defined by being a foreigner. They can be a totally complex character otherwise. I don't really see how his examples show his case.

For the Prince example, the rest of the costume is still there presumably, right? You're not supposed to think he's Prince just because he's black, but at the same time, I am not sure of I'd actually recognize they were supposed to be Prince based on his description, either. I would personally not wear blackface if I wanted to dress as Prince. I'm just addressing his argument in a vacuum. I think there would be controversy if they changed other things about the look of the character, like her hair colour.

&gt;I say this because if you have no problem with werewolves, vampires, and dryads existing in this universe, but think that if their skin is brown that it is a little too ""unrealistic""

I just think this is a made up argument, personally. The OP didn't make that argument. I've been all over the gutters of the internet, and I've never seen the argument that black people are ""unrealistic"".

I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt and say he probably means a stronger argument, like whether it's ""realistic"" for a medieval country to have people of colour in it, or whether it's internally consistent, or whether it fits the plot.

The thing is, werewolves, vampires, and dryads are all also genuine medieval European beliefs. The premise of this and other fantasy universes is to be set in a version of Europe where all their folklore is true, since that's the Europe people at the time believed they lived in. Those aren't added arbitrarily.

Whatever the point of the universe is, it should act from the perspective of the actual characters. I remember seeing this a few times on /r/skyrim. Some people find it strange the characters find dragons to be strange, mystical animals when they have so many mystical animals already. Some people find it strange they found a dagger embedded in a boulder(bear with me here), but other people said the game has all sorts of magic in it so it makes sense. But of course, in both cases, it's besides the point. It make sense for them to find magical creatures mundane, because in their universe, they are. It doesn't make sense for a dagger to be embedded in a stone, because that particular dagger wasn't magic. Whether it's like reality is totally irrelevant, it's about whether it makes sense from within the universe.

Thirdly, universes and stories have a point. For instance, racism is rampant in the universe of the Witcher, and a lot of the plot is dedicated towards making commentary on it. I don't think you can just recast characters arbitrarily without changing their plots or the plots of the universe. I honestly don't think it's hugely important here, since racism towards other species would be more important, but this goes for any changes at all in adaptations. It might seem like a small detail, but it can totally ruin the themes a story is going for.

 A cada 10 brasileiros que estavam trabalhando no terceiro trimestre deste ano, cerca de 4 atuavam na informalidade, apontam os[ dados da mais recente ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2018/10/desemprego-cai-para-119-no-terceiro-trimestre-e-atinge-125-milhoes.shtml)[Pnad](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2018/10/desemprego-cai-para-119-no-terceiro-trimestre-e-atinge-125-milhoes.shtml) (Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicílios) Contínua, do IBGE (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística).

 Entre junho e setembro, o país registrou 92,6 milhões de pessoas ocupadas.

 Dessas, quase 43%, ou 39,7 milhões de pessoas, não tinham carteira assinada, somando empregados do setor privado e público sem registro, trabalhadores por conta própria sem CNPJ, trabalhadores doméstico sem carteira e quem trabalha em família.

 Esse é o maior percentual trimestral registrado pela Pnad desde que o levantamento começou a separar os conta própria com e sem CNPJ, no fim de 2015.

 A maquiadora Cássia Lins Barbosa Vila Real, 31, que tenta uma vaga formal para trabalhar em meio período - Adriano Vizoni/Folhapress No terceiro trimestre deste ano, a taxa de desemprego no país ficou em 11,9%, 0,5 ponto percentual abaixo da registrada no mesmo período do ano passado.

 O alívio veio com o avanço de 1,5% na população ocupada, resultado da entrada de 1,3 milhão de pessoas no mercado de trabalho —especialmente na informalidade.

 Thiago Xavier, analista da consultoria Tendências, observa que, desse contingente, 601 mil trabalhavam no setor privado sem carteira assinada e outros 585 mil atuavam por conta própria —sendo 236 mil sem registro.

 ""A rota de entrada é a informalidade porque, na comparação anual, o trabalho com carteira [no setor privado] ainda registrou perda de 328 mil pessoas"", afirma.

 Desempregada há sete meses, Cássia Lins Barbosa Vila Real, 31, tem se virado com trabalhos por conta própria de maquiadora para pagar as contas. Ela afirma que o seu rendimento caiu 30% desde que foi demitida, em abril.

 Ela tem conseguido conciliar os trabalhos eventuais com a educação do filho, de uma ano e três meses, mas procura uma oportunidade de voltar para o mercado formal.

 ""Se eu achar algo por meio período, melhor ainda. Só trabalhando por conta própria a renda é muito baixa"", diz.

 Essa não foi a primeira vez que Cássia teve que se reinventar.

 Antes de entrar no mercado de beleza, ela trabalhou oito anos na gigante IBM, na parte de atendimento e também com vendas.

 Em 2014, a empresa fez cortes e, até ela se recolocar, dessa vez na nova profissão, foram dois anos sem trabalho.

 Segundo a maquiadora, além da falta de carteira assinada, os custos do trabalho por conta própria são o que mais dificulta a renda.

 ""Bancar produtos e transporte e não ter o trabalho valorizado, com o pessoal sempre querendo pagar menos, desmotiva, mas vou nessa até conseguir algo formal"", afirma ela, que cobra R$ 150 por cada maquiagem feita.

 Não é só a renda do informal que não avança. O rendimento médio real habitualmente recebido pelos ocupados (R$ 2.222) e a massa salarial (R$ 200,7 bilhões) —soma dos os rendimentos brutos recebidos em todos os trabalhados pelos ocupados— mantiveram-se estáveis no terceiro trimestre, afirma Cimar Azeredo, coordenador de Trabalho e Rendimento do IBGE.

 ""Isso demonstra que as vagas que foram criadas são de baixo impacto salarial"", diz.

 O fenômeno monetário também pode ser observado no Caged (Cadastro de Empregados e Desempregados do Ministério do Trabalho), que capta os números do mercado formal brasileiro.

 Em setembro, o saldo de vagas foi o melhor para o mês em cinco anos, com 137.336 postos positivos entre admitidos e desligados.

 Apesar disso, a média de salário para os trabalhadores admitidos foi a menor dos últimos dez meses: R$ 1.516,89.

 Segundo Clemente Granz Lucio, diretor técnico do Dieese (Departamento Intersindical de Estatística e Estudos Socioeconômicos), há várias possíveis causas para o fenômeno: o acumulado da inflação, a alta rotatividade do mercado, o perfil das vagas que estão contratando --que são mais operacionais no setor de serviços-- e a precarização da mão de obra, com alto número de informais.

 ""O repique da inflação influencia nos salários de admissão. E as funções que mais contratam, que são do setor de serviços, oferecem até 1,5 salário mínimo [R$ 1.431]. Tudo isso ajuda a puxar o salário médio para baixo.""

 O setor de serviços, mencionado por Lucio, foi responsável por 44,3% das contratações em setembro, fechando com um saldo de 60.961 no período, segundo o Caged.

 Maria Andréia Lameiras, técnica de planejamento e pesquisa do Ipea (Instituto de Pesquisa Econômica Aplicada), diz que a queda no salário médio de entrada não é necessariamente ruim.

 ""Um salário alto não significa que o mercado está bombando. Às vezes, ele está muito alto porque tem só um setor que paga mais contratando"", afirma.

 Segundo ela, o dado do Caged é positivo porque demonstra que o mercado está trazendo de volta uma população com qualificação mais baixa, que já estava havia muito tempo desempregada.

 Os especialistas afirmam que um caminho possível seria que, após retornar ao mercado pela informalidade, o trabalhador migrasse para um emprego com carteira.

 Foi o caso do motorista Nivaldo Constantino, 46, que voltou à formalidade após um período sem carteira.

 Ele perdeu o emprego como motorista de uma empresa em junho deste ano e passou a utilizar sua moto para fazer entregas.

 No mês passado, a mesma empresa que o demitiu ofereceu um novo emprego, dessa vez como motorista de motocicleta.

 ""A necessidade me abriu uma nova área de trabalho, e a partir disso pude voltar. Estou feliz, com carteira assinada e recebendo praticamente a mesma coisa que antes"", diz Nivaldo.

 Há ainda quem tenha feito do trabalho por conta própria uma nova profissão.

 O mestre de obras autônomo Marcelo de Almeida, 41, foi exonerado da Polícia Militar de São Paulo há cinco anos e viu na necessidade a oportunidade para iniciar uma nova carreira.

 Ele afirma que desde os 13 anos trabalhava com construção. Deixou as obras para entrar na polícia e, depois de 16 anos, precisou voltar.

 ""Comecei a pegar algumas obras e estou nessa há cinco anos. Não penso em trabalhar com outra coisa.""

 Apesar de ter tanto tempo trabalhando como autônomo, Almeida não pretende abrir uma empresa por causa dos altos custos e da burocracia.

 ""Tenho um contador, pago direitinho o pessoal que trabalha pra mim, mas não tenho como ter uma empresa e assinar carteira. A condição que tenho hoje está boa"", diz.

If Netflix is making something multicultural, there may be evidence they have to suggest people would prefer that.  

The creators can envision a multicultural world or a world where everyone looks vaguely Hispanic, and the only real conflict from the books is that some of the references pulls from Norse mythology/customs.  A strong theme in the Witcher stories is a growing and evolution and clashing of cultures and niches (Geralt is part of a dying class bc there is little demand for witchers, and elves are a dying race for one or 2 big reasons but trolls somehow are finding a place alongside humans) and in all honesty keeping a single race world would not properly reflect that underlying turmoil Geralt is cognizant of.  In fact Ciri is actually the product of a weird mixing of different people from different countries (spoiler yen was aware that ciri was a product of attempts to bring about a child of elder blood and triss wasn't happy about it, but it went back a few generations), it would make sense to make her look mixed in some way.

Which is up for discussion. Indeed, not every criminal acquires a gun the ""legit"" way - but ultimately it makes little difference. Why? Because the fact that guns are so easy to buy in America also means that obtaining a firearm illegally is dozens of times easier and cheaper than in the EU.

&gt;I've got my own ideas of course and I'm fairly sure you're going to blame the ""MSM"" or ""Blairites"" or something, anything but Corbyn but I'm keen to hear anyway. 

I obviously think we lost due to a combination of factors but I think it would make for a poor analysis if we didn't factor in the damage done by the attempted coup &amp; subsequent leadership challenge (we don't have to call them blairites), as well as the role of the media in terms of both their disproportionate attacks on Corbyn and his support, and their upholding of the consensus on austerity. 

I think we saw a massive turnaround in support during the election primarily because Labour put forward a coherent platform opposing austerity. I've gone on about the politics of retrenchment previously, and how Corbyn broke that consensus, but happy to go into more detail if you're not sure what I'm referring to.

I will respond below, but please know that I wasn't actually directing my comments to you directly, favoring instead the plural ""you."" You said to try and debate you. Normally, I might have tried to write a quick retort because, well, who cares? You're not going to change your mind. But, hey,  we're only a few days from the 6th, and I have to have faith in something, right?

1. You may be right about your parents, but there is a pattern in any community to assume the median ideals of your own community are the median ideals of the world. This is principally wrong no matter who you are, but it can and should be put forward that the United States is one of the most conservative nations in the first world. We're fighting fights and arguing over things people settled decades ago in other countries. Maybe your parents were centrists in America, but that's pretty far right in most other functioning democracies. Hell, a significant chunk of the dems are probably right of center. That brings me to my continuing theme of education. Not just knowledge from school, but knowledge from travel, from experiencing different ecosystems and environments, experiencing different people with different cultures and customs, different governments.

2. I'm glad we agree on that. Hopefully, when I get to number four, we can assume your religious convictions have nothing to do with your pro-life opinion. Because if you believed abortion is wrong due to religious convictions, that would mean you're invalidating other's beliefs based on your own beliefs being ""righter.""

3. My sophomore comment refers to the movement by name. Capital L Libertarian. Excuse me for that indistinction. Pure libertarianism built an idealism more fantastical than communism and only slightly less than all out anarchy. That being said, not all regulations are good. Some are outdated. Some attempt to solve one problem while creating another. Some were created purely out of political strategy. But a belief that the number of regulations is in any way an indication of liberty is nonsense. I have known a handful of self professed libertarians, and they're always obsessed with the quantity of laws, as if that gives you any more than an indirect bearing on freedom in a country. For a crappy example, the land of Nod has the following laws and sentences:

No nose picking ($30 fine)

No iced tea on Sundays (1 month in jail)

All pairs of shoes must be purchased separately (6 weeks community service)

The neighboring land of Goober has only one law and sentence:

Do not breathe (death by wild boar)

Where would you rather live? The point is regulations are sometimes good and sometimes bad. It is nuanced and libertarianism scoffs at nuance. And that nuance exists in every area. Economic issues. Social issues. Environmental issues. You believe (as do I) that we need to protect our natural resources and wild birds and stuff. But I also believe that we need to protect people from others who seek to take advantage of them, be they some guys robbing a 7-eleven or a billionaire with similar intent. It's all about nuance. And, as I mentioned before, there's no way to learn nuance like learning about the struggles of both sides of an argument. If you come from a viewpoint that nobody is fully evil, this is much easier to do. I'll get to the evil thing in number four again.

4. I'll try and touch on your points one at a time:

Conservative economics: This can mean a lot of things. Laissez faire business practices, trickle down economics, cutting government spending, etc. To begin with, trickle down has never worked and it will never work on any large scale. If libertarians believe that human nature drives growth and his business practices, then they must also admit that human nature is to hold onto what money you get. What is greed if not fear that you won't have enough later? Government bailouts, tax cuts, etc. I'm sure you've seen the numbers that show what a tiny percent of that ends up on the pockets of we, the normals, compared to giant corporations. They say it will lead to more jobs, but the layoffs continue. Sometimes it's nut even their fault. You can't stop automation and you can't stop environmental improvements. But rather than try and simulate spending to keep these people happy and healthy, this keeping the economy happy and healthy, we give giant checks to the companies that just lasted of 4000 workers. Meanwhile, since money doesn't grow on trees and must come from somewhere, our national debt grows. Despite talk of cutting spending and lessening the national debt, every republican presidency since Reagan has increased the national debt. Only one democratic president has failed at lessening it, and he inherited the worst recession since 1929 from a republican president (1929, btw, republican president and congress). Lastly on the topic of the economy, a little thought on cutting government spending: this usually means an end to ""entitlements."" This one is just can't stand to argue because it's a clear as glass case of ignorance or racism. Yes, people take advantage. No, not nearly as many as any republican candidate has ever indicated. What's more important, the combined cost of assisting those advantage takers is significantly less than giant companies manage to steal from taxpayers every year. If the goal is to save money, why aren't we going after the bigger, meaner fish first? Why are we going after the broke of their ass (or, if they're lying, nearly broke off their ass) fish? Perhaps, in an ideal world, where everybody was kind and considerate, conservative economic ideas could be effective. Note that this is the same world wherein communism could be effective. However, we don't live in that world, and if your ideals lean towards conservative economics, then the republicans are not your party.


Cracking down on illegal immigration: Yeah. This whole issue is the result of spin. The vast majority of democrats are for ending illegal immigration. Nobody wants people here who are dangerous or have nothing to contribute. The Rs will tell you we want open borders. Some do, but very very few. It's like the wall. A pipe dream that is just impossible in 2018. In a world with 8 billion people There will never be a FUNCTIONING wall on the southern border of the US and there will never be open borders. I ask you, who should be let in? That ""caravan"" that republicans wasn't so badly for you to have nightmares about are mostly people, just like you, born in a land where they are in constant danger of murder, kidnapping, rape, our themselves being forced into a life of crime. They seek asylum. A safe place to not be murdered. Sure, some are lying. Some aren't nice (though absolutely none are middle eastern terrorists lol). It's a shit situation for everyone. On one hand, it's not like we can just drop every central American into southern Texas and assume the country will function as normal. But on the other hand, what do you do to a few thousand each year? If a woman runs into the shop you own, begging you to let her hide from her abusive boyfriend, what do you do? You risk that she may have bad intentions or you basically send her back into the hands of violence. What we actually need to fix in this country is our legal immigration process. It's insane. I have a poor friend who has been trying to become citizen for years. I have a wealthy friend who immigrated for work from western Europe and took the oath within a week of landing on US soil. Lastly, I'll mention that the strong consensus among almost all economists is that immigration helps the US economy. Immigrant job thieving is a myth. Native English language skills will always give you an edge, not to mention that about 60% of us come into this world in the middle class or higher, meaning there will always be a huge leg up. Ask and I'll post some studies.


Freedom of speech: I'll admit, I'm mostly with you on this one. I think it's ironic that conservatives are pretending that they haven't essentially been the speech police in America for a hundred years, but young people are a little too sensitive and that's a big problem. I honestly believe we are in an adjustment period. With #metoo and Trump in the Whitehouse coming together at a time when women and minorities are finally seeing their day in politics, everyone is a little crazy right now. Unfortunately, I think balance can't really be achieved without rocking the boat. Sometimes the boat rocks too far. But I hope that as much as we both hate political correctness and identity politics, we can both admit that republicans are not the party of free speech. They are the party of the MPAA. Of Joe freaking McCarthy. This is a real example of the both sides argument. Hopefully the dems come back soon, but the republicans never changed.

Why? If Parliament wants it, then they can pass such an Act.

O interessante é que, antes de ser candidato, Trump era querido por todos, inclusive por muitas celebridades que hoje o atacam, mas antes disputavam a tapa convites para suas festas.

Quando ele entrou na campanha e se mostrou um candidato viável contra o establishment, aí toda a grande imprensa começou a atacá-lo. Ele passou a ser chamado de racista, sexista, fascista, etc, com mais de 90% de cobertura negativa.

&amp;#x200B;

And exactly that is why it is discouraged. We have tough standards because we need them. Dutch traffic compared to US traffic is more hectic: the cars are smaller, roads more narrow, there is less room for everybody. We do not use the keep your lane system that the US does use, which makes our highways a little more complex to navigate. Our signs are less far apart and less frequent in repetition, it is much easier to miss an exit here than in the states, changing lanes, entry and exit ramps are shorter.  In addition to this we have lots and lots of different types of road users: more pedestrians, bikes, motorbikes, with their own rules. Bikelanes, pedestriancrossings that take prevalence over cars here, where cars rule in the US. And then: there is the town layout: the US was planned in a time when carts and coaches were already in use: so they are accomodating to wheeled traffic, roads in Europe started when the dinosaurs roamed the earth so they tend to twist and bend with the landscape. This makes Dutch roads erratic and unpredictable where US roads are nice and straight in a predictable grid pattern.

Then we add to this that a Dutch driverslicense takes oodles and oodles of experience and classes and practical training to obtain, while a US driverslinsense can be picked up almost free with 2 packets of butter....leading to the idea that some US drivers, while in posession of a valid US license, might nog be proficient enough to tackle european traffic. 

And after all this we add the tendency to drive stick-shift in The Netherlands and automatic in the US, potentially adding yet another layer of complexity to a rental car.

False,BlackBeardManiac,1395083387.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_fqjud,False,"Not sure what to think of this article. Maybe it's the outside perspective that made some parts a bit ""strange"" to read. I feel like some important bits that put things into perspective are missing and others are presented as more important than they really are.


First, while it mentions that Helmut Kohl was her mentor, it fails to get the scope of his support accross. 
Merkel was positioned by him to get where she got and she ""inherited"" his political network and most of his allies. 
Kohl made sure she could rely on the base he had build for himself. That's doesn't mean she got everything handed to her, she won her constituency (Vorpommern) in the first election right after the reunification and kept winning it for a long time. 
But after 14 years ""era Kohl"", his influence on every branch and aspect of the german government should not be underestimated. He wanted her to succeed him and made sure she did.


The article also only glances over the fact that she grew up in the GDR (DDR), studied physics there and went into politics roughly at the same time Germany reunited (successfully so right from the start). 
I think that says a lot about her. About her intelligence and her ability to adapt. She will naturally have a good understanding of the present day russian position and perspective because of her upbringing. While this isn't relevant to the topic of the article, I think it increases her value as a politician in general given the current state of world affairs. The article brings it up, yes, but it's easy to miss.



&gt; she publicly took Kohl to task for his misdoings. [...] but then she acts in a decisive manner (as she did in turning on Kohl).

She didn't really ""turn on Kohl"". Helmut Kohl suffered the ""Schwarzgeldkonten"" scandal back then. He had substantial financial donations of anonymous origin hidden on accounts not associated with him or the party. She had to distance herself from him to save her career. It was well known to the public that Kohl supported Merkel and she had to avoid damage from the scandal to fall on her, too. I don't remember anything she personally did to ""take Kohl to task"". It was the legislative (Edit: I meant judiktive of course, not legislative) that dealt with Kohl on its own. He never explained in court where the money came from, btw, didn't go to jail for it or suffered any notable punishment. If anything, I would speculate she helped behind the scenes to get him out of it all with just a black eye. The article makes it sound a bit as if she backstabbed her mentor, I really don't think that's the correct way to look at it.



&gt; one thing has played virtually no role in her political ascent: a true political vision of her own.

Now that really irks me. Her vision, as that of her mentor, is obviously peace, stability and prosperity in Europe through the EU. Also, Germany at the center of that EU and she committed a lot, german tax money and often all her political weight, to the ""vision"" EU. I find it hard to not see that. Even more so when the article later talks about immigrants and her ""decision to open the doors"" in 2015.



&gt; Merkel’s “decision” to “open the doors” [...] has often been portrayed as a courageous strategy borne out of proudly humanitarian values. The truth is rather more complicated. As an ever-growing number of refugees reached the continent [...] 2015, Merkel initially refused to comment.

Europe simply wasn't prepared. The fault for that can be attributed to every EU member and the EU itself. The EU isn't a coherent block but souvereign countries that make their own decisions and have their own budget. Before 2015, nobody even contemplated to divert substantial finances to the EU border police, Frontex, to turn it into something that could reliably control the outer EU. So the outer EU border was controled/protected by the police of every single state on its own in 2015, no unified concept or strategy at all. The inner EU borders were/are open, physical checkpoints have long been demolished and there are only signs at the side of the road telling you that you've crossed into another EU country.

It was obvious if thousands of migrants *want* to get into the EU, they would. And after that, nothing is stopping them from moving further inwards, from Italy to France, from Greece to Germany, the roads are open and there are no controls in place. 
According to the Dublin Accord in 2015, migrants had to be registered in the EU country they first arrive at and apply for asylum, and stay for the time being, in that country.
The countries that would have had to process tens of thousands of migrants arriving every week, housing and feeding them and on top of that were responsible that these migrants don't cross the next (wide open) border, simply weren't up to the task and also financially already on a tight budget.

Merkel's ""open borders"" policy, wasn't a policy she chose, it was simply a reality the saw comming with no way to stop it at the time. The alternative to her ""refugees welcome"" policy, and the suspension of the Dublin Accords, would have been pictures of woefully inadequate police and security forces, failing to enforce EU law onto thousands of migrants who illegaly cross EU outer and inner borders as they please, going around the world.

Imagine the loss of trust and respect the EU would have suffered from this.

So no...

&gt; Virtually as soon as Merkel had figured out which way the crowd was headed—and rushed forward shouting, “Follow me!”—the mood in the country shifted.

... her decision wasn't due to what the polls showed would please the biggest part of the electorate. It was, IMHO, a very sound strategic decision that is still holding up, even in hindsight today. While she posed for selfies with the ""first"" refugees from Syria, behind the scenes, she quietly closed the Balkan Route and negotiated the deal with Turkey.

If you look at it from some distance, she really did everything right. At first, she bought time and prevented the EU looking like a joke, then she brought the situation under control with temprorary measures like the deal with Turkey (Turkey pretty much stopped most migrants off camera and we didn't really ask how), and presently it's all about cleaning up the mess so to say and to prepare the EU to handle the next migrant waves better.

She's getting a lot of critizism, from both sides, but she handled an impossible situation extremely well all things considered.

And she risked her own standing for it all as she must have known her ""refugees welcome"" would make her the one that gets the blame for every crime, every bad press the migrants create (like cologne new years eve, every rape, every theft, every murder.... it's all on her now).

So, the AFD, a party that pretty much wouldn't exist if it weren't for the migrant crisis, of course exxaggerated where possible and pushed that narrative that Merkel has to go because she has some evil, anti-german agenda. And it worked so far. 
But the AFD has concentrated so much on the ""Merkel muss weg!"" slogan (Merkel has to go!), that I assume most of the votes the AFD got are more anti-Merkel votes and less pro-AFD votes. 

Now that Merkel has announced that she'll step down completely, she has robbed the AFD of what the party defined itself by the most. The AFD is the anti-immigration and anti-Merkel party. That's what the AFD stands for and why people gave them their vote. I bet the next elections will see the AFD marginalized like its right predecessors, the Republikaner, NPD, DVU etc etc.




&gt; And yet I increasingly fear that history will judge Merkel rather more harshly [...] (because) she has failed to mount a satisfactory response to the three major crises Europe has faced over the past decade. [...]
Her reluctance to reform the European Union in response to the euro crisis prolonged southern Europe’s economic pain and leaves the single currency vulnerable to future economic crises.

Yes, but Merkel doesn't control the EU. She can't just reform away and Germany has to be careful not to appear as if it has too much control over the EU. Many already believe Germany is too powerful in the EU and feel threatened by it. Economic reforms or changes to the monetary union are better to be addressed by France. 
And most important, but I won't go into detail with that, some EU members have to get their house in order.



&gt; And her unwillingness to confront authoritarian populists in Poland and Hungary has weakened democracy in central Europe

What is she supposed to do? Seriously. How is Germany, or Merkel supposed to confront the populists in Poland or Hungary? They would immediately turn critizism from Germany into political capital at home anyway. Germany is tolerated at best in many parts of Eastern Europe. German money is welcome of course, but german advice or influence is not.


That got a bit longer than I intended. But I really felt like Merkel deserves a bit better than this article.

My last post was about how my husband and I have begun the process of discussing adoption because IUI was as far as we were ever willing to go seeing as were in the US and don’t have any coverage for infertility. Well, my husbands already amazing job (he’s paid handsomely and his employer pays his portion of his monthly insurance premium) is not an American company. They are a European company with an American based department. 

Anyway, yesterday they sent out a memo and packet for the new insurance they’ve decided to offer their American employees. They’ll still pay for all costs associated to the premium. It’s Aetna. There’s two plans to choose from; ones a high deductible plan and ones a regular PPO (don’t know exactly what that means) The high deductible offers $50,000 lifetime max of fertility treatments and ART. Under art was listed Ivf, infra-fallopian embryo something or other and something about zygote transfer procedure. 

Anyway, now my husband and I have a whole other conversation to have. Last night I just showed him the paperwork and literally said “ well I guess we have some stuff to decide”.  This is dizzying. I feel like someone just handed us 50k and said if you toss in 5600 (the high deduc and the 10% coinsurance) you can give it a shot. I’m beyond grateful for the insurance and his job but I never thought in a million years I’d ever even have to decide if IVF was for us. I’m sorry if this seems silly to anyone.

The EU is a monetary union but not a fiscal one. You also have EU members not in the monetary union but of a broader European Union. It becomes very complicated in that, while the EU is integrated, in many areas, it's less integrated than Canada &amp; the US are. So, there are a lot of instances where financial instruments are traded across member states which would touch numerous fiscal and regulatory regimes that often differ significantly. For any single person, it would be grossly complicated to manage this, so bearer securities make sense. Europe has a much lower rate of stock ownership by average people (compared to the US, and even Canada), and a way to circumvent the often cumbersome regulation is to enable the use of bearer securities.

You are saying that the U.S., which conquered ""Babylon"" in the war with Iraq and was therefore ""grafted"" into the namesake, means that the U.S. is now considered Babylon, and we shall fall if we don't change our currency.

Those from overseas who ship their wares to us to buy will weep when smoke arises from the United Nations in New York, where nations debated and bankers demanded them to hide their irreconcilable differences for profit's sake. New York will be attacked (again) and burn.

False,kommuni,1469565554.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_zu3am,False,"Popular is not the same thing as competitive and lucrative is not the same thing as either of those 2. The US has an unusual league system for most of its sports that doesn't encourage competition in the same way that European soccer does. It also doesn't encourage loyalty in quite the same way either. LA has one of the most popular basketball teams (the Lakers) but having lived there for a while I can tell you that half the city stopped watching basketball and the other half switched to supporting their derby rivals, the Clippers, when the Lakers went through a period of being terrible. A ton of locals stopped watching basketball entirely and switched over to watching the Kings playing NHL instead. This is a really bizarre concept to European clubs, which sometimes have centuries of history and are deeply tied to local communities. I can't even imagine a local Manchester United supporter suddenly flipping to supporting City. Rivalries mean something very different outside of the US.   

But wait, it gets weirder! The Lakers were not native to Los Angeles, the entire franchise started in Minnesota. The Lakers are popular because basketball is the most locally popular sport they're doing well and because they're native to a massive city with tons of money that lionizes stars in that sport. Similarly, Dallas is a massively wealthy oil city in a state that loves American football above all else. Juventus don't reside in cities with astronomical wealth in quite the same way that these the Lakers and Cowboys do but their fan base is much more loyal. When Juventus got slapped by the league most of the fans stuck around and they were able to claw their way back to prominence gradually. If the same thing were to happen to the Cowboys or Lakers the fans would simply move onto another team or another sport. This has been a long winded way of saying that, yes, sports with franchise systems are popular in the US but the teams don't inspire the same kind of loyalty or even general interest. It's more about watching ""a game"" in a sport you like rather than ""my team"" play. In my opinion this helps explain why American football is a niche sport outside of the US. The US population in the US is roughly half that of all of Europe combined but it has massive cities with vast disposable income. This means that local franchises for rich teams stay rich: those teams have a ton of wealthy fans that keep the coffers full. I don't think European soccer teams in the proposed league would have the same draw as American football teams in the NFL because the fan base has weaker geographical loyalty.

Nudity is still somewhat ""sexy"" in many places in Europe, but it isn't nowhere near as big a taboo as it is in America, where there can literally be debates about public breastfeeding. I've made the comparison in the past that European programming (specifically, German) censors gory violence - which is actually people being malicious to each other - but is fairly tolerant about bared breasts and tobacco/alcohol use, both of which are individual choices that America condemns due to what I'd call outdated moralistic reasons (Prohibition and Puritanism). America is the opposite. You can show some pretty violent stuff in TV crime dramas, but you gotta censor that nipple!

And, even if the taboo were lifted off women being topless entirely, it's not like America will become some nudist haven.

I love firearms themselves for the mechanics and the history. I don't much care for motorcycles, but can nonetheless understand why one would be enamored with those death machines (talk to an EMT for more gruesome detail)!

If America is going to become like the other developed nations aren't there other things we need first? Infrastructure, education reforms, public transit in cities like LA that are disgusting nightmares? These things also decrease violence, but in a way that also benefits everyone by providing safety and a way forward to a better life, and America is falling behind. If the democrats reversed on the gun issue perhaps they would get enough support from single issue voters (which for guns there are plenty) so they could start flipping more places.

Included below is also my refutation to the common complaint that gun violence is a crazy epidemic, when in reality it is very very low.

The thing is that gun violence in the US is extremely low, even if it is proportionally somewhat higher than Europe, I think its a reasonable trade for both diversity of population and free ownership of firearms.

The Guardian reports here that 33,000 people are killed per year, so when compared with a population of 330,000,000 its 0.01% of the population. For comparison France, where firearm ownership is ostensibly ""banned with exemptions"" there were 1,745 deaths to a population of 66,000,000 resulting in a percentage of 0.001. A much lower figure, but I think it highlight how much of a relative non issue this is when we could be focused on reforming our healthcare and education systems (which I believe will have a large impact in bringing gun violence down as well).

Here are my sources so you can take a look.

Hydraulics (from Greek: Υδραυλική) is a technology and applied science using engineering, chemistry, and other sciences involving the mechanical properties and use of liquids. At a very basic level, hydraulics is the liquid counterpart of pneumatics, which concerns gases. Fluid mechanics provides the theoretical foundation for hydraulics, which focuses on the applied engineering using the properties of fluids. In its fluid power applications, hydraulics is used for the generation, control, and transmission of power by the use of pressurized liquids.

**Greek language**

Greek (Modern Greek: ελληνικά [eliniˈka], elliniká, ""Greek"", ελληνική γλώσσα [eliniˈci ˈɣlosa] ( listen), ellinikí glóssa, ""Greek language"") is an independent branch of the Indo-European family of languages, native to Greece and other parts of the Eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea. It has the longest documented history of any living Indo-European language, spanning 34 centuries (3,400 years) of written records. Its writing system has been the Greek alphabet for the major part of its history; other systems, such as Linear B and the Cypriot syllabary, were used previously. The alphabet arose from the Phoenician script and was in turn the basis of the Latin, Cyrillic, Armenian, Coptic, Gothic and many other writing systems.

***

**Applied science**

Applied science is the application of existing scientific knowledge to practical applications, like technology or inventions.

Within natural science, disciplines that are basic science, also called pure science, develop basic information to 

predict and perhaps explain and understand phenomena in the natural world. Applied science is the use of scientific processes and knowledge as the means to achieve a particular practical or useful result. This includes a broad range of applied science related fields from engineering, business, medicine to early childhood education.

***

**Engineering**

Engineering is the creative application of science, mathematical methods, and empirical evidence to the innovation, design, construction, operation and maintenance of structures, machines, materials, devices, systems, processes, and organizations for the benefit of humankind. The discipline of engineering encompasses a broad range of more specialized fields of engineering, each with a more specific emphasis on particular areas of applied mathematics, applied science, and types of application. See glossary of engineering.

The term engineering is derived from the Latin ingenium, meaning ""cleverness"" and  ingeniare, meaning ""to contrive, devise"".

***

**Chemistry**

Chemistry is the scientific discipline involved with compounds composed of atoms, i.e. elements, and molecules, i.e. combinations of atoms: their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other compounds. Chemistry addresses topics such as how atoms and molecules interact via chemical bonds to form new chemical compounds.

***

**Liquid**

A liquid is a nearly incompressible fluid that conforms to the shape of its container but retains a (nearly) constant volume independent of pressure. As such, it is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid, gas, and plasma), and is the only state with a definite volume but no fixed shape. A liquid is made up of tiny vibrating particles of matter, such as atoms, held together by intermolecular bonds. Water is, by far, the most common liquid on Earth.

In that it's about people immigrating, yes, but all the finer points are nothing alike. If anything the better historical allegory is probably the viking invasions and the general Norse migration, where half of them wanted to plunder and the other half wanted to trade. The only issue there is the moonrace never quite figured out how trade works, so they end up in this clusterfuck of a situation where they are conquerors pussyfooting around conquering. They never actually figure out how to come to a mutually beneficial arrangement.

On the topic of American immigration though, when people make the argument that these people are humans too, they don't realize they are implicitly arguing that being human means being American (or European, since that's just as much an issue). Never mind that these people usually start on the lowest rung of society, it's being ""human"" that really matters. The number of times I've heard a progressive globalist say something to the effect of ""we need these people to scrub our toilets"" should clue you in that this has nothing to do with thinking these people are human.

&gt;World War II prompted the largest displacement of human beings the world has ever seen—although today's refugee crisis is starting to approach its unprecedented scale. But even with millions of European Jews displaced from their homes, the United States had a poor track record offering asylum. Most notoriously, in June 1939, the German ocean liner St. Louis and its 937 passengers, almost all Jewish, were turned away from the port of Miami, forcing the ship to return to Europe; more than a quarter died in the Holocaust.

We must never forget that the horrors that man does to man can darken any door even our own. If you think that your world is safe think again. 

Additionally, the US government used the same national security defense of infiltrators and spies that it's using now. With that history now firmly put into context; history has judged the leaders that turned away the Jews as being wrong.

HD linkHello everyone, here we are with a fresh update.This time we want to tell you about something completely different, something very important in every game: animations.As suggested by the community, we need to do something about the animations, as they are extremely important for immersion. That is how we see the subject. It’s the reason why we are developing all- new animations for human models. We don’t want to keep animations for humans from the older game; everything has to go! We will make a start with this for EA and complete it in the full version development cycle and beyond.The translation of “we want better animations” is that we want toMake soldiers look organic in their motion.Make animations fluent so they don’t break up or look buggy, eg. moving their hands about at Mach 3 when they loop or switch animations, Prevent soldiers from starting oscillations of animation strings that makes them look like they are ‘dancing the samba’. Make soldiers look realistic when they are idle - they will squat down to get some rest, switch their weapon from one hand to the other, look around every now and again (facing forward ALL the time is not how a soldier is instructed to behave, situational awareness for the AI will now be better).Give humans realistic movement limitations. In previous games released for ‘Gem2’ game engine, soldiers INSTANTLY rotate and shoot at the enemy without aiming. In GoH, the swivelling of head/ hip/ arm/ legs takes time, soldiers are no longer instant turn- and- shoot machines.Introduce AI reaction time (current setup is 0.2-0.5 seconds for the soldiers to analyze and “react” to sudden events).Make soldiers have custom animations for boarding or unloading of vehicles, so they move around the vehicle much more naturally.It’s obviously nice to know what you want, but let’s complete this thought with what we really do not want to see: Robotic-looking animations and weird posturesSoldiers that look like statues pointing their rifles in general directions all the timeThe cliché that for a strategy game ‘a basic set of animations will do’Soldiers disappearing in the middle of nowhere as they enter vehicles because they use a generic boarding animation that does not match the hatch/ door positions of the vehicle, so the animation finishes halfway outside the tank as the soldiers vanish.We’re quite sure you will have seen these odd things in some games; in due time we will make them become a thing of the past….GameplayAnimations and behaviour have quite an impact on gameplay; besides the fact that we will make sure the animations look better, obviously, gameplay will improve considerably on a number of counts.For vehicles we have strong improvements in the pipeline, too. We are working to have custom animations for every individual vehicle (in the full version, not in EA), something that has rarely been done in any game before. This is a very long process, which will take years to complete, so a lot of animation work will be done post-release. We want to make soldiers synchronize seamlessly with the motion of vehicle doors/hatches and avoid “floating” soldiers or the like. One cosmetic feature we are working on are animations for boarding vehicles. Soldiers will holster/ unholster their weapons, ready to go for a drive when they board a vehicle, or ready go into action immediately after getting out. For soldiers we will have a more natural reaction to changes in every situation; players will need to adjust to different reaction times. Your troops need to react + turn + aim at the target before shooting. Having one soldier taking care of your flank might not be enough to stop a sneaking raid. You will be able to discover a sneaking raid earlier than before, due to soldiers looking around every now and again to observe the surroundings will make it much harder for you to sneak past them. These are very ambitious plans, and we want to become even more ambitious if we have the resources for it from our publisher; however, it takes a lot of time to make animations look good and we have to do a lot of them, so we won’t be finished any time soon.Note that the less aimbot-like characteristics, swivelling times for human rotations, and other features spoken previously in devblogs, such as progressive aiming (zeroing), all knit together to create a slower-paced but more realistic gameplay style. In this slower environment there is more time for the player to emphasize the use of the features of our game engine that make it so unique: Scavenging inventories, resupplying your guns, having a look around; And in the case of Gates of Hell: Completing secret objectives.So here is a small collection of animations we’re working on. NOTE: all of this is work in progress in alpha/ beta stage and will be subject of improvement:https://youtu.be/a1KttCjW6TkWith this video there are 2 footnotes:1) Weapon animations for infantry do not move weapon mechanisms as of now. We will very soon address this problem and come back to you in the next blog with the results of our work.2) The bayonet attack features a voice callout, re-used from old resources. We are looking for Russian voice actors to re- record the remaining 33% of the Soviet faction. Interested? Apply here: http://barbed-wire.eu/join/Future animation plans (After Early Access):We intend to include quite a number of new infantry animations in the EA package, and a fair number of fully-finished vehicle infantry animations. After EA it evolves into the full release (6-12 months after day one of EA), and we will continue to produce new sets of animations. One possible extension of our plans would be weapon-based animations for each individual firearm, or a group of them; for instance, reloading the Sten gun with the sideways-facing magazine should not play the same animation as reloading an MP40; likewise, reloading a belt-fed MG-42 shouldn’t look the same as replacing a DP-27 pan-shaped magazine. Whether we manage to complete this or not depends on how well received the changes are, and we would be achieving these features with joint efforts with our publisher Best Way.As you can see, the ambition is there; we are pushing like hell! Which brings us to the question: are you the animator which can help us speed up the process? Check out the vacancy on our website.Did you know?The Sten gun was prone to clip the little finger of the soldier firing it, if the firing action made the top of the little finger slip into the slot on the side of the body where the cocking knob ran.The magazine of the Sten gun was a direct copy of the German Erma MP38 magazine.Soviet troops, especially behind enemy lines, enjoyed utilising german ‘Schmeissers’ for their low weight and controllable bursts. On the other hand, German frontline soldiers often looked for Soviet PPsH submachine guns, which very rarely jammed.That is it for the moment. Tell us what you think; are we on the right track?

Yet stop I did: in fact I often do,    
And always end much at a loss like this,      
Wondering what to look for; wondering, too,    
When churches fall completely out of use    
What we shall turn them into, if we shall keep    
A few cathedrals chronically on show,   
Their parchment, plate, and pyx in locked cases,    
And let the rest rent-free to rain and sheep.    
Shall we avoid them as unlucky places?     

Or, after dark, will dubious women come    
To make their children touch a particular stone;    
Pick simples for a cancer; or on some   
Advised night see walking a dead one?    
Power of some sort or other will go on   
In games, in riddles, seemingly at random;   
But superstition, like belief, must die,   
And what remains when disbelief has gone?   
Grass, weedy pavement, brambles, buttress, sky,
