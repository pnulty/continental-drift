The Legend of Zelda

is an action-adventure video game developed and published by Nintendo and designed by Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka. Set in the fantasy land of Hyrule, the plot centers on a boy named Link, the playable protagonist, who aims to collect the eight fragments of the Triforce of Wisdom in order to rescue Princess Zelda from the antagonist, Ganon. During the course of the game, the player (seeing Link from a top-down perspective) navigates throughout the overworld and several dungeons, defeating enemies and uncovering secrets along the way.The first game of The Legend of Zelda series, it was originally released in Japan as a launch title for the Family Computer Disk System peripheral in 1986. More than a year later, North America and Europe received releases on the Nintendo Entertainment System in cartridge format, being the first home console title to include an internal battery for saving data.

Even the economic system has more going on in it than just capitalism.

&gt;The foundations are capitalism

The foundations are as much feudalistic as they are capitalistic.

&gt;but then we are at ""capitalism misallocates resources"".

No, we aren't. You're still blaming capitalism without a mechanism in mind and without taking other factors into account.

&gt;But that doesn't really cover it, because under capitalism starving people isn't a misallocation of resources if those resources are making a greater profit elsewhere.

Resources don't generate profit, they generate rent. Capital generates profit.

And it would be weird if capital would generate more profit creating luxury goods than creating food for people who are literally starving. Capitalism doesn't seem to provide any explanation for such a weird circumstance.

&gt;because wasted code is a good bit different from wasted food.

Not really. In both cases you have a nominally large amount of production that then gets pared down to an apparently smaller amount of production due to refinement. You end up with a smaller amount of more useful product. As long as the increase in usefulness more than outweighs the reduction in amount, this is efficient to do.

&gt;&gt;What other factors went into creating that state of affairs?

&gt;The drive to maximize profit.

In what sense? Maximize total profit across the entire economy? Maximize the profit of each individual company? Maximize the profitability of capital? And how would it lead to people being unable to afford things? You'd think more profit would be collected in a world where people *could* afford things.

&gt;Yes it is.

No, it isn't. Capitalism is literally not about land.

&gt;Without the theft of land via things like enclosure in Europe, or the forced displacement of native people outside of Europe, Capitalism wouldn't have gotten off the ground.

Why not? Does capital magically lose its usefulness in a world where people can freely access land? I'm not seeing it.

&gt;I don't see why wages necessarily go down as productivity increases

I didn't say 'as productivity increases'. (Productivity of what?) I said 'as civilization advances'. And I explained this pretty thoroughly later in my previous post. ('It's a natural consequence [...]')

&gt;Like a right to life...

A right to *not be killed* would be more precise. Nobody has any obligation to keep you from starving, but they do have an obligation not to stab you in your sleep.

&gt;like a right to a decent wage in return for labor performed?

There is no such right.

You have the right to enjoy the full amount of wealth that your own labor produces. (And 'enjoy' includes being able to invest it and collect whatever profit comes from it, which is why capitalism is morally necessary.) You do *not* have any right to be guaranteed that this amount is above any particular absolute level. If you did, we would be under an obligation to halt the progress of civilization in order to protect the value of labor (see above).

&gt;Yep, even more so really...

I find that doubtful.

&gt;As where you stand now is built on a foundation that comes from people working together.

Division of labor is one thing, but it does not imply people giving up their wealth to others.

&gt;For example, unless you wen't to completely private schools your entire life your education is based on people giving up some of their wealth to help everyone else.

Not necessarily. Maybe public education could be funded using unearned wealth.

&gt;vegetables discarded because they didn't look like how people expected them to look.

Apparently because nobody is willing and able to pay enough to have them *not* discarded.

&gt;Yes, thanks to things like enclosure and such. You, as a private individual, can't just walk out there and throw down a farm wherever you feel like.

Ah, so it's a limitation on land. Once again, this isn't a capitalism problem.

&gt;If you were hungry would you be content to starve?

No, but this is irrelevant. My lack of contentment doesn't create an obligation for anyone else. Only their interference with my life can create an obligation for them. If they have done nothing to stop me from working to sustain my own existence, they are under no moral obligation to help sustain my existence if my efforts fail.

&gt;Evolution is an ""is"" not an ""aught"".

So is survivor bias.

&gt;We are economically invested in everybody's success.

Not to the point of sacrificing our own.

&gt;The tubers collected from a days gathering weren't ""capital"", it was food.

Indeed. But the spears and stone axes were capital.

&gt;Then why isn't that what we see now?

It is what we see now.

&gt;Companies making massive amounts of profit

No. Companies are collecting massive amounts of *rent.* Actual profit margins are not particularly high, and have gone down since the mid 20th century.

&gt;why then does wealth become increasingly concentrated at the top over time.

Because of private landownership and other such rentseeking.

&gt;In a way that maximizes profit, but ignoring externalities when possible.

No. Ignoring the externalities doesn't increase your profits. And across the entire economy it actually decreases profits. It's bad for capital investment.

&gt;The difference there is that the capital investors and the landowners aren't the ones a) doing the work

The workers aren't the ones providing the capital, either. If they were, they would have no need to do business with a capital investor.

&gt;One where the capital investors and the landowners hold all the cards.

No. Capital investors hold the capital card. Landowners hold the land card. Workers hold the labor card. There is no fundamental economic principle guaranteeing that any of these has greater value, and thus bestows greater power, than any other. However, the advancement of civilization tends to increase the value/power of the land card compared to the others.

&gt;Workers, individual, don't have any room to negotiate...

Only because the land has been taken away from them. This is not a capitalism problem. No amount of capital can deny a worker the option of leaving and striking out on his own. Only the unfair control of land can do that.

&gt;No it isn't. It is the company that is choosing to maximize profit over people having clean water.

Denying people clean water doesn't generate profit, it generates rent. Denying people *anything* doesn't generate profit, it generates rent. Profit is a reward for a *productive* activity, namely capital investment, which doesn't take anything away from anybody.

&gt;I'm talking about an increase in rent... the company paying for the consequences of its pollution.

The rent is generated anyway. If the company *doesn't* pay for the consequences of its pollution, that just means it collects the rent.

&gt;But then they'd stop benefiting.

&gt;Sen. Trumbull attempted to assure Senators that Indians were not “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States. Sen. Johnson argued that Sen. Trumbull was in error in regards to the Indian’s not being under the jurisdiction of the United States. This must have raised concerns with Howard because he strongly made it known that he had no intention whatsoever to confer citizenship upon the Indians under his amendment, no matter if born within or outside of their tribal lands.

Yeah, it was not intended to apply to Native Americans.  Again, there is no doubt or debate on that.  But the debate between Cowan and Trumbull certainly made clear it would make the children born of Chinese citizens.

Edgar Cowan Pa: I will ask whether it will not have the effect of naturalizing the children of the Chinese and gypsies born in this country?

Senator Trumbull: Undoubtedly.

Cowan: \[Uses xenophobic fear mongering to suggest that California would soon belong Mongolian or Chinese rather than the Indo-European races.\]

Trumbull: I should like to inquire of my friend from Pennsylvania if the children of Chinese now born in this country are not citizens?

Cowan: I think not.

Trumbull: I understand that under the naturalization laws the children who are born here of parents who have not been naturalized are citizens.  Is not the child born in this country of German parents a citizen?

Cowan: The honorable Senator assumes that which is not the fact.  The children of German parents are citizens; but Germans are not Chinese.

Trumbull: The law makes no such distinction; and the child of an Asiatic is just as much a citizen as the child of a European.

In another interview he asserts that he doesn't have the 'confidence' that Sam has in establishing 'reason' framework in the place of religion and for the masses to adopt such. This has been echoed by Dan Dennett etc throughout the years, and I'd be sure Sam is familiar with this argument.


---


Here's my thoughts on this:


Murray's goal does not run *counter* to Sam's, it's simply a different lane. Murray want's to slow the rollback of Christianity to prevent the insurgence of other religions in its place. He simply isn't as confident Reason will prevail (regardless of if he believes it *should*).


I must say as a hard-and-fast atheist, this has previously seemed unproductive to me, and (similar to you) counter to the cause of Reason. But in more recent years I can see the 'preserving our ethical/traditional roots' argument having a bit more weight to it. That's not to say I support church or prayer, or religious texts or commandments or religiously mandated action. I mean more in a historical sense, not dismissing its impact out of hand, and not being so quick to remove its style/language/traditions. Again as an atheist this feels strange to think this.


---


As a quick finishing analogy:


On census's for a country (in my case Australia) the 'Other' or 'No Religion' status has been rising. Yet these numbers jumping ship from a religion into the atheist/null category are not coming from Eastern religions. They are (I would estimate anyway) coming from Christianity. 


So this is not strictly a global fall in religiosity (though I do believe that is overall happening), but instead a fall of Western religion, making way for the growth of religions like Islam.


That is something to at least note, if not be concerned about, and I believe that analogy extends beyond just religious identity.

“I salute the arrow and the gun.” -Sri Kaal Ji Ki Ustat, Bachitar Natak 


Shastar Naam Mala has 858 verses written in praise of guns. 


Twareekh Guru Khalsa, Gur Pad Prem Parkash, and Suraj Parkash, premier works on the life of Guru Gobind Singh, have numerous references to the tenth masters’ admiration for guns. 


Guru Gobind Singh’s instructions to his army were: 
ਤੀਰੋ ਤੁਫੰਗੋ ਬਡੋ ਰਾਮ ਜੰਗੋ ਧਮਕ ਧਾਰ ਅਣੀਆਰ ਕਮੰਦ ਕੋਰੜਾ॥ ਪੰਜ ਸ਼ਸਤਰ ਪਰਵਾਣ॥
Of the six weapons mentioned here, three: ਤੁਫੰਗੋ, ਬਡੋ ਰਾਮ ਜੰਗੋ, and ਧਮਕ ਧਾਰ are guns. 



Here is further evidence from Twarikh Sikhan written in Farsi by Munshi Khushwaqt Rai in 1811. The following is related to the formation of the Khalsa and Guru Gobind Singh Ji’s transformation :

“ਅਜ਼ਾਂ ਰੋਜ਼ ਜ਼ੁਨਾਰ ਬ ਸ਼ਿਕਸਤ, ਵ ਲਿਬਾਸ ਨੀਲਗੂੰ ਅਖ਼ਤਯਾਰ ਕਰਦ, ਵ ਜ਼ੈਵਰ ਆਹਨੀ ਗੁਜੀਦ, ਵ ਵਜਾੱ ਗ਼ੈਰ ਮੁਕੱਰਰ ਨਮੂਦ,ਨ ਦੋ ਸ਼ਮਸ਼ੈਰ ਬਰ ਕਮਰ ਬਸਤ, ਖ ਕਾਰਦ ਵ ਚੱਕ੍ਰ ਵ ਤਪੰਚਾ ਵ ਕਮਾਣ ਵਗੈਰਾ ਹਰਬਾ ਹਾਇ ਆਹਨੀ ਬਰਖ਼ੁਦ ਆਵੇਖ਼ਤ | ਵਦਸਤਾਰ ਬ-ਕਦਰ ਯਕ ਦਸਤ ਦਰਾਜ਼ ਬਸਤਨ ਆੱਦਤ ਕਰਦ | ”

“From that day the Janeoo was broken. The Blue dress was adorned. Sarbloh (Carbon Steel) ornaments were adorned. A distinct appearance was made. Two gallant baldrics with swords were put on, along with weapons belt, a knife, _Chakram_ (rounded mental quoit), a pistol, bow, and other such weapons and ornaments were adorned. The wearing of an _Ucha Dumalla_ (tall style of Turban) was introduced.”

Not, we could theoretically create a european style football league where each division has 15 teams and you play everyone once, 7 home, 7 away and the top two play for a title or something.

Conversely, driving in Europe was a nightmare to me because they roads were narrower than in California, and there were no proper exits with loop-arounds if you've taken the wrong one or want to go in opposite direction, like how we have 4-loops here.

Instead, roads just forked off into two in the middle like Ys and the ""exit"" could be in either direction - left or right, and the main-road could continue in either direction.

- Attack on Titan (2013) is a dark action series about fighting man eating giants. The anime has incredible animation and an awesome soundtrack I also think it has one of the best first two episodes in anime. One of the most popular anime out there. Lots of mystery and cliffhangers.

[Attack on Titan OP 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvpZHdC80lE)

- My Hero Academia (2016) Is for you if you like the Marvel or DC superhero films a typical underdog rises to the top story but it’s really well executed and has a cast of beloved characters with some good action and a great soundtrack. Also good for newcomers one of the most popular anime out there right now along with OPM and AOT.

[My Hero Academia OP 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu0HjPzFYnY)




- JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012) Generational action shonen that involves multiple characters throughout time. Adapted from an older manga that is still going after decades. Has a very unique sense of style with a really creative battle system that makes it standout from many action shonen. Would give it until episode 12 to know if its for you. (Part 1 is considered the weakest of the 8)

[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 1 OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_vux8N4dy4)

- One Punch Man (2015) This anime has some amazing animation done for it. One Punch Man I think has one of the best fight scenes in anime. It also kind of parodies the battle shonen (basically the tropes present in superhero movies and anime like DBZ).

[One Punch Man OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atxYe-nOa9w)

- Mob Psycho (2016) Similar to OPM in that it is an action comedy (same author) about a psyhic boy and his mentor a con artist fighting other psychics and the various spirits that plague their city.

[Mob Psycho 100] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTvKNoru41Q)

- Redline (2009) Adrenaline the anime.

[Redline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t26m_Q6ENo)

- Death Note (2006) Supernatural crime/detective drama about a book that allows you to kill anyone in the world if you know their face and name. Main character plans to use it to create a utopia vs other main character and detectives who try to stop him. A story of psychological battles and tricks to gain an upper hand. A very well regarded anime.

[Death Note OP 1]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QE9cmfxx4s)


- FMAB (Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood) (2009)A boy makes a Faustian bargain and has to revert the consequences by going on an adventure to find a mystical stone of alchemy the philosopher stone. Deals with imperialism, militarism, redemption, forgiveness, the value of human life and science vs faith and the pros and cons that both have when taken to extreme and not regulated. I would recommend the dub for this one I usually will say watch in subtitles but I like the dub for this anime better. 

[FMAB OP 1]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PusR3agGeio)




- Legend of the Galactic Heroes (OVA 1988-1997) Like Star Wars in a way but with more focus on space battles and politics pitting a corrupt democracy against a virtuous authoritarian state rather than a light vs dark battle with space magic. Some incredible characters and interesting conflicts regarding war, governance and human nature.  Overall a great epic space opera. My personal favorite anime of all time by a large margin. Recent remake not a bad adaptation but it is a bit rushed and only covers the first book OVA covered all 10 plus the prequel Gaiden.

- A Silent Voice (2016 movie release) Deals with redemption group think, bullying and suicide. Film has some awesome shots and a unbelievable soundtrack. One of my favorite redemption stories ever. I would also read the manga after finishing it though as the movie does exclude some side character development. It’s more of a low key romance and does have some comedy but the focus is on the inner turmoil and drama. (still awaiting a legal release of the film in NA manga is available though in NA. Seems like a legal release is coming soon finally sigh)

[Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfK6UgLra7g)


- Shirobako (2014) An anime literally about making anime. (if you enjoy this see Bakuman an anime/manga about making manga)

[Shirobako OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e9S2z3vPhI)

[Bakuman S2 OP2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkEQ58iMmNg)

- Psycho Pass (2012) A cyberpunk detective story and one of the better villains I have seen in anime has some interesting views on society and creating a utopia with some good action as well. I would say it’s like Minority Report if you have seen that movie. 

[Psycho Pass OP 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWBDuVCuiUQ)


- Yona of the Dawn (2014) action/adventure with an Asian low fantasy setting. Lots of character development occurs regarding the main character throughout the series one of my favorite Female MC’s (her journey from spoiled princess to dashing rogue is wonderful). You might have to switch to the manga when you are done with the anime unfortunately. Manga is fairly successful but it’s been awhile since the last season. Author is a fan of LOTOR and it kind of has the epic adventure aspect of that.

[Yona of the Dawn OP 1]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfgNlVdDnxs)

- Haikyuu! (2014) If you want to see a sports anime that definitely keeps you hyped and engaged. Overall has a fairly good and wide range cast that receives some development. Even if you aren't a sports fan I think it’s a great watch. 

[Haikyuu! OP 1]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2---3Iysnqg)

- Saga of Tanya the Evil (2017) While the premise is pretty strange in some ways the main character being the age/gender they are reincarnated in is more to shield her true nature and have people underestimate her. The premise is basically magic World War I (with some WW2 elements) with the author actually throwing in a few historical references here and there. 

[Saga of Tanya the Evil Op](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMwlVyfy3m4)

 - 3-Gatsu no Lion (2016) Is also worth a shot it deals with a pro shogi player (Shogi is like chess though there are a few differences) dealing with depression and overcoming it. This one is another favorite but it’s a slower anime so just be open to the fact. It also has some wonderful side characters and can be quite funny at times. The shogi scenes are also really good even if you don’t know the rules since the focus is on the psychological battle between the two characters and Shaft really did a lot of great work on the imagery.

[3-Gatsu No Lion OP 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKWqPXkLgzY)

- Code Geass (2006) Is another really popular anime deals with the moral complexities of revolution and rebellion. It takes place in an alternate history and it’s also a pretty good intro to the mecha genre. Some great character development and moral dilemmas that the characters face. (mecha shows that involve big giant robots think Transformers but people pilot them)

[Code Geass OP 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ7zQbMxm28)

- Cowboy Bebop (1998) An action space series animation holds up amazing well today also had one of the best endings in anime. Episodic mostly with a few overarching plot lines. One of the more well regarded anime out there and one of my favorites. There is some pretty good humor as well. It’s basically a space Western if you have seen Firefly it’s somewhat of like that. Also recommend the dub for this one.

[Cowboy Bebop OP]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI_8PUXx2A)

- Ghost in the Shell (Movie 1995) (SAC 2002) It’s a cyberpunk action/mystery story with a focus around what human consciousness is. SAC is more focused as a crime action drama. Both are highly praised.

[Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex 2nd GIG 2004 OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQIqgxeNtl0)


- Violet Evergarden (2018) Beautiful animation from Kyoto Animation. Mostly a slice of life series in a post war world (somewhat like post war Europe after world war 1). Focuses on an emotionally stunted child soldier who is learning more about human emotions and how to convey them in words. Mostly a slice of life series though there are more action segments towards the end.

[Violet Evergarden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFVKmVTAHpk)

- Barakamon(2014) A Pro calligrapher named Handa is exiled to an isolated island away from Tokyo to reflect on his actions after attacking a well respected calligrapher after critiquing his work. Story is mostly a comedy/slice of life with various antics with the locals and Handa but can also be fairly introspective and heartwarming.

[Barakamon OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vvL3z3pAs0)



- Vinland Saga(manga only now but anime in production likely late 2019 early 2020) Takes place in the early 11th century towards the end of the Viking Age. A story that can be summed up in one world STRUGGLE. Not just the violence but living day to day in unstable world. Deals with the realities of war, slavery and political chaos that defined Europe after the Fall of the Western Roman Empire. Hopefully it sees a good adaption.

[Vinland Saga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rwiua0hXOVo)


- The Promised Neverland (anime Winter 2019) Anime about children escaping an orphanage after discovering a horrifying secret. Battles of wits and of late has been my favorite Jump title (up to chapter 34 end of volume 4 of the manga).

There’s no chance you’re going to be right one way or the other about which server regions have higher skilled players. And your precious Tfue doesn’t play on EU servers just ErycTriceps doesn’t play on NA. It’s not like players hop around servers looking for the sweatiest lobbies.

Grappler was controversial but eventually embraced by the community as people found ways to counter it. Turbo building crossed the line for a handful of players but ultimately widened the skill cap so players liked that.

So with the election coming up it is important we learn a thing or two about Socialism. Socialism has never worked in history, it didn't in China, in Russia, in India, in Venezuela, in the Middle East, in Africa or any continent on Earth. Instead the only thing it managed to achieve is to set countries back.

Venezuela had a temperate climate, a lush terrain, world's largest oil reserves and a seaside location that makes it easy to deliver its goods ands services all around the world. Venezuela literally won the lottery of geography and could have easily became a paradise in South America. But why did it fail? 

Socialism.

India is a democratic country who thanks to blessed location, geography and natural resources could have became the economic superpower of the world easily with the right guidance. In fact right now thanks to its huge population the Indian Youtube channel TSeries is about to eclipse Pew Die Pie as the largest channel on YouTube. It boasts of a space program that Australia don't have and is predicted to be next economic giant alongside China. But yet why is India today still so poor, why did it only started growing quickly since the 90s?

It's because the IMF forced them to liberalise their economy and get rid of socialism.

The USSR was the superpower of the world, it defeated the Nazi scourage, it sent the first man to space, it developed the AK47 and will forever be known to mankind as the first pioneers of space explorations. But yet why did it fail?

It's because it's people realised a Big Mac tastes better than the lack of food they got under socialism.

China is now one of the economic superpowers of the world, its one of the few countries that have a station in space, it boasts of a high speed rail network and major tech companies like Huawei, Lenovo, Tencent, Alibaba that are amongst the best in the world. But yet how did a country with such potential cause tens of millions of its citizens to starve to death? 

It's because of socialism. And without it a few of my relatives could still be alive. 

Even in the European countries like Norway/Sweden, the models of socialists everywhere did not come at a great cost. Sure they have free unis, hospitals, amazing welfare systems etc, but yet does anything come freely? Nothing ever is free and the price tag is extreme income taxes up to 61.85% just so you can spend more than half your hard earned money to pay for everyone else.

That is the paradise socialism envisioned, and that is the cost you must be willing to pay. Young people of Melbourne, it is up to us and no one else to build a better Australia for our children to live in. If we are to respect the victims of history we must understand them, learn from them and not repeat their mistakes again. 

If we can do that fellow Australians, then the countless victims of socialism did not die in vain.

Do I think a Jew born in 1970 should get reparations for the Holocaust? No, because they didn't go through the Holocaust. Nice try, but it's a swing and a miss, I'm afraid. 

You should put more effort into actually bettering yourself, rather than blaming everyone else.

It's not, it's Poland's fault, because after the iron curtain fell they were more interested in leaving than building the nation up.

Maybe if Poland didn't try to measure its tiny cock, with a destitute military (see, funny thing, Poland was mismanaged before the war), it wouldn't have been fucked quite so roughly.

Ask yourself; what is Huber doing right now during these recent days. What is his title? Who does he report to? Think on that.

The federal reserve, well.. what a beauty! Talk about David and the Goliath. Seems we’ll be going through some hard times soon. Markets indicating something special (signaling **crash**?).

It is too late, IMF will not stop warning about it. Their whole system will collapse and the petro dollar will be no more. Welcome to the new system: a system regulated by congress again, as always intended by our forefathers and Article I of the constitution. And guess who gets to poke and troll the beast the whole way? POTUS. He has been ramping up his hints, have you noticed?


&gt; “If the Fed backs off and starts talking a little more Dovish, I think we’re going to be right back to our 2,800 to 2,900 target range that we’ve had for the S&amp;P 500.” Scott Wren, Wells Fargo.

-DJT Twitter, yesterday 8:53 AM EST.

Drip drip drip, getting the people ready.. tax cuts have bought us time, tax cuts round 2 will buy us more (next week? Watch and see!)

Yet, not right or lefty majorities understand the typhoon about to hit the markets. This is the ultimate goal of the plan. DESTROY what **powers** the cabal; their global central banking slave plantations. **Debt is their power over you**.

Let’s move on to other things;

**Saudi Arabia.** It is true, they have been vile, but **controlled** for many years by the deep state. In order to get their oil in an agreement we made decades ago a trade deal with lesser POTUS’ for military protection and the requirement that they use the USD (the debt note/petro dollar). Now DJT has *signaled* the fall of the Fed again here, but it is missed by people like you who do not look. He does so by telling Salman to start thinking about paying for the military... peculiar? Why no, not to an untrained eye. This looks more like retribution to the common American, unless you know about the historical significance here: said petro dollar deal mentioned before. This is one of the many parts of the world peace plan: Saudi Arabia is also mentioned as ‘Wonderland’ from the leaked HRC emails, and HRC is Alice. What is SA known for? Corruption. Pedophilia. Deep state. Who was arrested Nov 4th 2017? What was Las Vegas shooting really? The SA arrests were the start of the Saudis *own* liberation.

**North Korea,** is it a plus or minus? Congratulations, NK is no longer a threat. Part of the world peace plan of the grand plan.

**European Union**. Is this one not self explanatory? Where do the Rothschilds, Soros, **Payseurs** come from? Why, history is important indeed, agreed? Remember central banks here. This is part of the world peace plan and also involves part of the grand plan to topple their global monetary socialist system of debt slaves: freedom to our world.

**China**. The greatest threat currently to the world, by far. Russia (tried) to be blamed? Event (WAR) needed? Who had access to HRC’s server? WHO was close to Feinstein (think Chinese spy report)? Feinstein was the senator to...? California &gt; Silicon Valley &gt; ‘Silicon Valley of the World’ think her Shenzhen ties. Google in process to build most advanced censorship search engine for China? **DRAGONFLY** - POTUS warns google against acting in Chinese interest and VPOTUS has made statement recently at a certain university laying it all out. Who stole multiple STATE SECRETS from us through HRC server? China. Who really launched the missile from Hawaii? Look at reports regarding China stealing (given) our military launch codes. Many more traitors. This is part of the world peace plan to reign in China.

Deep state? Wait and see, think Huber again. This is part of the JUSTICE plan of the grand plan.

All of these things simultaneously took off at once January 20th 2017. There is so much more.

Once you calm down and start getting your emotions in check, you may want to start thinking things through, even though your feelings feel painful right now. Tears in fact often reflect emotional pain as well as physical pain, so working through the pain is key to your long term personal growth.

Your boss, despite being the paragon of virtue and patience he is, reacted with surprise, sadness, impatience, anger and almost certainly with *criticism*. You may or may not know this, but one of the surest ways of killing enthusiasm in an employee is by criticism. Unless you know whether or not they can benefit from *constructive* criticism or not, it is pure poison.

Prevention would have helped immensely in this situation. But when he called you, it was a *fait accompli*. What did he want? Perhaps wisely, he wanted to make the best of a bad situation, that the situation doesn't end up being a total loss/disaster. 

But did he motivate you? He left you worried, and the worry cooked in your head during the train ride, so that when you reached the store, you were in panic mode (again, how can you go backwards in time?), you burst into tears of regret, humiliation, self blame, fear of inadequacy. In front of an innocent bystander, no less. At least she had the human decency to comfort you. But probably she was more confused rather than uncomfortable. People are not used to the forced intimacy of having to comfort acquaintances, but I imagine that she did her best.

Did he examine the cause of the mix up? Did he make any effort to remove 110% of the blame from your side? Did he agree to the unrealistic promise and commitment you made that ""this will never happen again.""? Are you promising that life doesn't happen, that an unforeseen emergency room situation will *not* take precedence over your irreplaceable presence? He *needs* to bring you back to functionality as a dependable, responsible employee and not as some abject servant groveling before her master. He needs to work on putting you into an ""I'm OK, You're OK"" position, not to keep you in the ""I'm Not OK"" state.

If you work in sales, you may know of a Chinese saying ""A Man Without a Smiling Face Must Never Open a Shop."" When you deal with customers, you should put them at ease, appear to be pleasant and happy to see them, serve them and thank them for their business. Being a manager or an employee is no different. Basic human relations are part and parcel of your professionalism.

Curiously, I decided to comment on your post because [I watched a Youtube video of Yannis Varoufakis talking about his role in the Greek debt crisis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKaPeWoS7PQ). He obliviously admits that he criticized the central bankers, European politicians and diplomats who were trying to help him dig himself out of a hole. He in no way blamed himself or Greece, or searched for a creative solution where his lenders could save face. He actually prefers to be in Omonia Square demonstrating against the powers that be rather than responsibly and pragmatically cooperating with ""the devil himself"", despite the voters having voted the left wing party in by 60%! He admits that Left wing parties not only criticize their opponents but each other!

Only one left wing pundit ever talkes about common human decency and politeness, that would be Slavoj Zizek. Even he brings up Freudian issues, for example that our current civilization oscillates between Perversion and Hyseteria, and other things that would make your mother blush. [Zizek puts a lot of emphasis on politeness as a social imperative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm8NyQwW0OY&amp;t=55m) (polite tolerance between neighbors in his Google talk, the Bartleby quotation ""I would prefer not to"", which I translate as ""Thanks but no thanks""), perhaps because he is still seeking a win win solution for human relations.The idea is to keep on negotiating (or ""struggle"") for personal and social goals, but without antagonizing the ""big Other"". Of course, he sets politeness in opposition to vulgar right wing people like Donald Trump, Sarah Palin, Berlusconi, etc.

To conclude, you've already been advised to keep your emotions in check. That might be impractical advice. Your long term goal (as opposed to the urgent oscillations your emotions are currently experiencing) is to use your god given rational side to 'balance' your emotional side, to examine the facts, verify your 'psychic map' so that it reflects a neutral reality. Make use your close friends and relatives to examine your feelings and map out a practical strategy so that, in the long term, your professionalism, dependability and value are not questioned. 

I myself can be long winded, lose my focus, and forgetful. I use a variety of techniques, including a phone planner (S planner on my Samsung 4) to keep track of both urgent and important reminders. I listen before I speak, so that helps me to *think* before I speak as well. Thinking is a time bending tool that allows us to look at at stars while we steer our ship, and not get distracted with the hubbub on deck.

Uhh, europe? you mean the most leftist continent/most leftist group of nations in the world?  your claim appears completely without merit.

&gt;Bolsanaro is threatening to kill people ""suspected"" of drug trafficking and openly admitted to plans of mass genocide.

Hmmm, for some reason I think the above quoted is exaggerated but still, I will look into it.

It sounds a lot like what Rodrigo Duterte did in the Phillipines.... he decided to take an extremely aggressive stance against drug addicts and drug peddlers, it led to a lot of deaths but it did legitimately take care of a terrible problem that plagued his nation. Being in a nation that is plagued by that same problem, I can't say I sympathize with druggies/drug dealers.

Compared to a leftist, dystopian police state like the U.K. which europe seems to favor, I'd say at least Bolsanaro appears to have the best interest of his nation at heart, even if I strongly disagree with his methods.... the U.K. has arrested people for facebook comments, literally dragging them out of their home in the middle of the night, arrested a man for carrying a potato peeler, arrested a man for a comedy video on youtube, arrested a man for practicing journalism, yet won't arrest actual terrorists like returning ISIS fighters....

The U.K. is much worse.

&gt;in the Philippines Duterte is gunning people down in the streets

I think the reason that is happening is important.... the people being gunned down were terrorists and responsible for a great deal of atrocities. I don't agree with Duterte's methods but I simply cannot sympathize with hardcore criminals.

&gt;the left has hardly any power.

Tigers - Ah yes the almost extinct creature that now only is found in Siberia and parts of India?  Only coming back due to OUR help.

Lions - They occupy the savannah and parts of Africa sparsely populated and thus not in our way, yet still hunted by cattle herders in parts of Africa.

Leopards.  Again those found in Africa, not in our way.  The snow leopard in the Hialayas?  Almost exticnt due to poaching.

Komodo Dragons occupy islands that are not inhabited full time by people.

Crocodiles and Alligators are also widely hunted for their skins.  They also occupy a niche area such as swamps, rivers/oceans in Africa, Americas and Australia that dont directly come into contact with a lot of humans.

Polar Bears - Who the hell lives in the Arctic circle for it to matter?

Bears - Wonder why there are no bear or wolf populations in Europe until recently when reintroduced?  We exterminated them all.  Ireland here for example has had any in centuries.

&amp;#x200B;

So as another user has said, we could wipe them out easily but we dont as they dont always directly come into competition with us, however once they do they get killed.

Humans are the most popularly agreed (of course there are other factors) reason for the Holocene extinction of all Megafauna, that is creatures well beyond our physical size.

Let me give you an example. I play ETQW twice a week; its daily peak is 32 players or less most of the times. However, at the evenings of EU and NA regions, it is quite easy to find a full or near full server to play with people. Moreover, the game is no longer digitally available, you need to get a physical copy from Amazon, eBay, etc. to play online. So, despite the fact 30+ people play the game online everyday, should it be called dead game? No, it should not.

[This view of the 70s is a common misconception.](https://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/how-has-inequality-changed) 1979 is the year in which the UK economy was at its most equal. Since then there has been growing inequality. The decline in inequality also began in the 1940s when taxation was at it's most extreme and then slowed and declined in the 1980s when taxation was most reduced. 

&gt;Hollande tried to introduce it in France several years ago and you know how that went down?

That was mainly because of capital flight. The way to address this is greater co-operation with other nations. If all nations had a higher rate of taxation then this would be less of an issue. 

&gt;Zero of the least wealth inequal countries in the world have supertaxes.

It depends on how you define super-taxes. Sweden, a European country with one of the worlds largest Gini coefficients, has a top tax rate of over 60%. There is also an excessive amount of present mindedness in this conversation. If this discussion was had 50 years ago, then most of the worlds wealthiest nations had a very high level of taxation. Just as the economy has changed in the last 50 years it will likely change again in the next 50. There is nothing final about the current state of affairs.

One of the most important and unique features of our brand is attention to detail and the fit of every piece in our collections. Our designers spend hours working on each style, making it look and feel perfect.

Fitted styles make the femininity, fragility and grace of a woman stand out. A calmer, more flared cut does not constrain the movement. Longer coats are made for a more classic look, whereas short jackets give an outfit a sportier feel.

First of all, the sporty style is determined by the length of the jacket - it is short. Designers of the brand tried to combine sports comfort and elegance. In such a sports jacket it is convenient to drive a car, it does not hinder movement and does not create unnecessary volume. This jacket can be worn in combination with the pants Naumi, jeans and even a skirt. As you understand, the sports style does not necessarily require the presence of sneakers or sweatpants.

Whether you are wearing a classic Naumi coat or a sports jacket - one thing will remain the same - femininity and elegance.

(like a slimport or whatever) 

The short answer is:

* Look for Slimport
* Look for compatibility with Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and 9 which also use Slimport
* There are simple USB-C to Slimport adapters (portable, I take this + a HDMI cable on hotel trips for e.g. watching Netflix or my own trip photos)
* There are Slimport compatible hubs that also feature UTP ethernet and USB ports. The advantage over the simple adapter that with most of these, you can charge the V20 while also using e.g. the HDMI connection. So recommended for longer sessions. Mine (Huawei Matedock - I have 3 of them now) need a Power Delivery (PD) adapter/charger to do that. Qualcomm QuickCharge (QC 2.0/3.0) does not charge the V20 through the hub.

The long answer (will take 1-2 hours to read everything) is to follow all the info and links provided in the post and comments here:

2. I think department store brands like Acne and APC are quality brands - but both have a European sensibility. Many of the Los Angeles based department store brands will be focused on certain washes or stretch/comfort properties to sell their jeans, not necessarily denim quality.

Not planned economy, of course, but recently I've read an interview with a major property developer in my country where the property prices have been skyrocketing recently (and it's worse in other parts of Europe), and the government naturally decided something needs to be done about it, their solution was to try to start building subsidized mass housing (think council estates and those nice suburbs in the UK they built after the war).

Well, turns out the government entering the property market to compete against private companies is prohibited by EU competition law! 

And the construction agencies in individual countries are not allowed to treat government housing construction as any different from the private construction, so ""speeding up"" development, ending the construction land speculation where a private company buys land suitable for large-scale construction and then deliberately holds it for as long as price is increasing, then selling it to property developers, which then increases the price of the final product (housing) - most frequently in lucrative parts of cities where plenty of high volume family housing could be built - is also out of the question!

So for now we're stuck with large construction corporations who apparently couldn't care less about the needs of families just making the prices ever higher, forcing everyone to get bigger and bigger mortgages, for a longer period, which again decreases confidence in young people to start families and have more children.

Now, I live in a large city (and have my own housing there so I'm lucky) but would be fine with moving to a more rural area where housing is completely affordable - many young people are choosing that option but most people want to live in reasonable proximity to cities for work etc. and not sacrifice ""active social life"". 

So the consequence is plenty of young people spending their money on renting very expensive (by standards of what the appropriate price should be) properties, usually two bedroom flats, having little security, with their own housing being unaffordable.

De-urbabization is likely the future, but I am convinced that the governments, instead of spending money on nonsense like development aid should invest into housing and compete against private companies - it doesn't directly hurt private property rights, but it also keeps their financial appetites in check because competition and the market works regardless of who is competing - private vs. private or state vs. private.",True,False,False,,0,1541067769,,1541068052,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e8ua5vu,False,t3_9t7usl,False,t1_e8u8who,/r/The_Donald/comments/9t7usl/white_extinction_is_a_myth_but_we_will_replace/e8ua5vu/,,1544860286,5,True,False,The_Donald,t5_38unr,r/The_Donald,public,

Well that is the whole point that it's NOT.

Lenin oversaw colonialism turn into market imperialism, wherein it was not just resources flowing out of a country but the global burgeoise also moved in to exploit the labor and customers of that area.That is imperialism.

But Lenin, nor Stalin, survived to see Financialization which happened after Bretton Woods and basically the Nixon Shock:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_shock

Which rolled in the casino ponzi scheme economy of global debt, financial instruments and stock brokers.

I read somebody, I don't remember who, who described this perfectly that basically the Financialization is what saved Capitalism from it's lack of growth in the 70's and so on.

Capital must constantly innovate itself and make itself more efficient and more overreaching into society in order to survive, which is what Marx described. 

In the Communist Manifesto he talks about how ""traditional values"" have turned into mere money relations.

So we can see how Capitalism commodifies and exploits every aspect of human life. 

The Financialization was the 2nd extension of Capitalism ,because it saved the dwindling profits from industrial capital and the new profits now are almost exlusively made by gambling (most corporations just rebuy their shares, and do phony financial transctions).

-------------------

But the 3rd expansion is into the digital realm in my opinion especially with copyright, which tries to commodify and privatize speech basically. It will carve up the digital realm into corporate fiefdoms where literally, eventually you will have to pay money to say words (that will be the dystopian effect of it). Notice how common English words are already copyrighted and trademarked. It will only get worse.

&gt; ""Intellectual property"" is a coercive attempt by the bourgeoisie to restrict this copying. 

No it's just expansion of capital into the digital realm, and as with any other form of property it is exlusionary. If a word is trademarked, you can't use it, just as if a farm is owned privately, you can't use it.

It is the next stage of capital expansion which will commodify even the very words which we will speak, it will be truly dystopian.

&gt; And you can also see ordinary people routinely disregarding these laws. 

That is irrelevant, just becaue laws can be dodged that doesn't mean that a lot of people won't become victims of it.

Article 13 of the EU effectively will ban links and memes from the internet, and since most people are on 6-7 major websites, if those companies will comply, which they will, we will lose our free speech in Europe basically.

False,redrhyski,1229419194.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_3blek,False,"The National Crime Agency has launched an investigation into Arron Banks and other people and groups linked to the leave campaign over suspected criminal offences in the Brexit referendum, it has announced.


It came after the Electoral Commission said it had referred the cases to the NCA over suspicions that a “number of criminal offences may have been committed”, and that there were reasonable grounds to suspect that Banks, the insurance millionaire who backed the unofficial leave campaign, was not the “true source” of £8m in loans to it.

An Electoral Commission statement said its investigation focused on £2m reported to have been lent to Better for the Country, a company he used to finance the Leave.EU campaign, and £6m more reportedly given to the organisation, on behalf of Leave.EU, by Banks.

Of this money, £2.9m was used to fund referendum spending on behalf of Leave.EU.

The Electoral Commission statement said: “Due to multiple suspected offences, some of which fall outside the commission’s remit, the commission has referred this matter and handed its evidence to the National Crime Agency.”

The NCA confirmed it had begun an investigation connected to “suspected electoral law offences covered by that referral, as well as any associated offences”.

It said in a statement: “While electoral law offences would not routinely fall within the NCA’s remit, the nature of the necessary inquiries and the potential for offences to have been committed other than under electoral law lead us to consider an NCA investigation appropriate in this instance.”

Banks, formerly a major bankroller of Ukip, has denied any wrongdoing. Andy Wigmore, a spokesperson for Leave.EU, said: “It’s completely to be expected. It will finally bring a head to all these crazy allegations made about us. We’re not worried.”



Those referred to the NCA are Banks, Better for the Country, Leave.EU, Elizabeth Bilney – a long-time Banks associate – and what are described as “other associated companies and individuals”.

The investigation centres on the suspicion Banks “was not the true source” of the £8m of loans made to Better for the Country, and that loans involved funds from a “non-qualifying or impermissible company” based in the Isle of Man.

The Electoral Commission statement said the investigation would look into whether Banks, Bilney and others involved in Better for the Country, Leave.EU and associated companies “concealed the true details of these financial transactions”.

Bob Posner, the Electoral Commission’s director of political finance and regulation, said: “We have reasonable grounds to suspect money given to Better for the Country came from impermissible sources and that Mr Banks and Ms Bilney, the responsible person for Leave.EU, knowingly concealed the true circumstances under which this money was provided.

“This is significant because at least £2.9m of this money was used to fund referendum spending and donations during the regulated period of the EU referendum.

“Our investigation has unveiled evidence that suggests criminal offences have been committed which fall beyond the remit of the commission. This is why we have handed our evidence to the NCA to allow them to investigate and take any appropriate law enforcement action. This is now a criminal investigation.

“The financial transactions we have investigated include companies incorporated in Gibraltar and the Isle of Man.

Much of the public is so enamored of the idea of MAD that they don't really see the ways in which the policy can fail nor the fact that several nuclear powers no longer believe it to be a core philosophy of nuclear doctrine.

Russia for instance has long since adopted the idea of ""Escalate to Deescalate"". The idea being that they know that any protracted conflict with NATO or really any near or peer level power eventually shifts against them due to logistical and technical challenges. In response to this they have developed a doctrine of limited scope in theater nuclear strikes designed to *force* a diplomatic crisis.

They believe that in such a scenario that western powers will freeze momentarily due to fear of nuclear escalation. Thus buying them a brief window in which they can sue for negotiations, ones that will likely be acquiesced to in order to reduce the risk of catastrophic escalation. 

The have become so enamored of this idea that limited use scope nuclear strikes to force compliance have become ingrained in all levels of their strategic thinking both offensively and defensively, across a broad array of scenarios.

These developments have played a large part in influencing U.S. policy in regards to placing missile defense systems in eastern Europe as well as abandoning the INF treaty. 

Missile defense systems are not currently a realistic deterrent to a full scale nuclear exchange, how ever they could certainly be problematic for someone trying to use very limited scope short to moderate range nuclear weapons, particularity given that they would be most likely to be used geographically near to such systems. Thus Russian frustration with the idea of U.S. missile defense systems in Europe, it undercuts a key portion of their doctrine and potentially limits them to conventional conflict which for a multitude of reasons is a losing proposition for them in the long run. 

As regards to the INF treaty, Russia has long abandoned it in pursuit of intermediate and short range, low to moderate yield nuclear weapons. Part of the reason their ""Escalate to Deescalate"" policy makes sense is that for many years the U.S. has had only limited options to respond in kind to such a strike, as our nuclear policy is centered around deterring a large scale exchange. Meaning that we would be more likely to negotiate than respond with a disproportionately large reprisal risking full blown nuclear conflict.

If I didn't manage to catch your angle please give me a heads up. As a disclaimer, I'm German and this is certain to effect my point of view on this topic.

Economically, the EU is between a rock and a hard place. Brexit is going to cost any way. Either one applies the same rules one does to any third country - and thus causing the consequences you mentioned - or one finds an extra accommodating solution. However in doing so one obsoletes the economical part of the EU as the member countries themselves would not see the point in carrying the costs or adhering to the rules of these shared institutions if it is demonstrated, that the benefits can be reaped even without. As such, these institutions would collapse, and that what UK is asking for won't exist in the first place, not to mention the gargantuan loss in both capital and jobs that comes from the collapse of the shared supply infrastructure. Once factoring this in the clear line against UK actually is the one with the lowest losses associated to the EU.


Politically, Barnier is executing the will of the EU27. As such it is his task to try to match any UK proposal against the rule book given to him by the 27. He thus doesn't have the option to be more accommodating than he is at the moment, even if - and I personally doubt it - he personally would be willing to do so. Remember that any deal has to be agreed to by the 27 and not Barnier. 

Additionally, the EU never was a primarily economic union in the first place. The foremost role of it is as a guarantor of peace and democracy on the continent. While certainly not limited to this, this role was an important factor when deciding on expanding the EU to include ex military dictatorships such as Greece - that it wasn't fit economy wise was something that has been discussed at that time already, if you care to search older archives.

Establishing a precedent in taking a pick and thus disassembling the common rules and freedoms would allow other EU states, which if you look east are partially already trying to do so, to justify deriving from the framework that has been established and held true in an attempt to pacify a continent that historically was very used to violence. If you look back the past or so millennium you'll find that the EU is representing one of the longest periods of relative peace there ever was. The UK frankly is not worth it to risk it.

Aproveitando para corrigir a minha hipocrisia inicial, vou também dar-me os parabéns a mim próprio, porque a nossa situação é idêntica nas coisas que mencionaste (pais que pagaram as despesas, e se passasse da ""validade"" era eu que pagava).

Quando digo reality check, era com o intuito de inferir a quantidade (que não é pouca de certeza) de gente com, suponhamos, a média igual ou superior que tu (ou que eu) que não tiveram a hipótese de escolher o teu curso, e o que isso nos beneficia na colocação onde quer que tenhamos entrado. Muitas das médias dos cursos que por aí andam só não são mais altas porque, assim estimado a olho, 1/3 do pessoal que podia tirar um curso tem que entrar no mercado forçosamente aos 18 por razões financeiras, e outro 1/3 por razões sociais (porque escolheram mal no 10º, porque o único curso que queriam não dá, porque seguem negócio da família, porque os pais não vêm benefício no ensino superior, porque os pais emigram...). Era só isso.

Sobre a classe média: Estava a referir-me à classe média na faixa 45-70 anos, ou seja, os pais. Essa não faz ninguém emigrar porque numa situação ideal (e para ideal, vou referenciar tema de discórdia - o sector público) vão tendo redução de horário, vão criando empresas (e emprego) e/ou vão-se reformando. O dinheiro e o trabalho disponível vão sendo libertados duma maneira ou doutra. O problema é ter classe média recém-graduada à espera de salários iguais aos dos pais, e para isso fazerem coisas como exigir acima da média ou criar startups sem nexo para chularem os seus colegas de curso. Não há mais bolsas de mérito porque o estado prefere compensar o excesso de procura com uma barreira económica, do que restringir (ainda mais) o numerus clausus. É um pouco como aumentar os impostos da viatura privada (IUC, IA, combustíveis), em vez de melhorar as condições de transportes públicos e alternativos.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Mas é a classe média que mete os filhos em privadas? Julgava que fosse a alta. E haver mais privadas acabava com ""tanta banalidade com ensino superior concluído""? Julgava que vinham mais banalidades do privado do que do público...

""Olhe que não"". Cada vez há mais filhos da classe média a ocupar as privadas. E sim, veêm mais banalidades das privadas, mas também há, estranhamente, algumas excepções, como também há bons médicos formados na UBI ou bons engenheiros formados num politécnico de Cucujões. E no tema dos politécnicos, cada vez há mais nas cidades pequenas, e estão-se a tornar na nova forma de explorar recém licenciados (caso de Portalegre, Fundão, Viseu, Beja, onde estão a aparecer pólos tecnológicos para dar vazão aos engenheiros, TOCs e designers no desemprego).

Sobre o numerus clausus de medicina, é claramente diferente dos outros numerus clausus. Os limites de vagas em medicina só existem por causa da ordem deles, já os outros existem porque, em muitos casos, têm de ter, mas também porque há certas universidades mais prestigiadas ou desejadas geograficamente. Ainda é raro ver um curso que não seja medicina ou uma engenharia no Técnico, FEUP, Braga que preencha tudo na 1ª fase.

False,Gunnar_Grautnes,1520251986.0,,,[],,4∆,dark,text,t2_kgtfshc,False,"I think there are two main lines of argument against this position, namely appeals to enlightened self-interest and appeals to moral duty.

Appeals to moral duty, in one way or another, point to the duties that we as humans, and, by extension, aggregates of humans such as states, have towards each other. It may well be that we have a primary duty towards some group, family say, and that states likewise have a primary duty towards its own citizens. It is compatible with this to say that states have a duty to help citizens of foreign countries even if they haven't solved all of their internal issues. If you look at the kind of issues which foreign aid usually or at least ostensibly is intended to avail, these issues are a lot more serious than the internal issues of most rich countries. It may well be that a state's pensioners receive insufficient care, or that parts of its infrastructure is in need of repair, or that its educational system is underfunded. Nevertheless, these issues pale in comparison with food shortages threatening to kill millions, or the millions dying of preventable diseases at a young age around the world. Often, in discussing our duties towards the global sufferers, Singer's example of passing by a drowning child is brought up. In this case, we might consider a father whose primary duty is towards his child, who, on his way home to his child's birthday, passes by a drowning child. Surely the duty of the father to save this child takes precedence over his duty to be home in time for his child's birthday, even if the latter forms part of his primary duties. It is not unreasonable to think that something like this holds for states also.

We often think that we have particular duties towards those we have harmed. Through wars, colonialism, pollution, and myriads of ways of ongoing exploitation, most rich countries have contributed to most poor countries being poor, and been a cause behind the issues these countries face. It is not unreasonable to think that most rich states therefore have particular duties towards most poor states. 

Appeals to enlightened self-interest point to the ways in which global issues also tend to birth internal issues, and how foreign aid can be an efficient way to tackle these issues. One might think of how the civil war in Syria has led to a wave of refugees to Europe, or how bad healthcare systems in poor countries can give rise to pandemics which threaten rich countries equally, or how poverty in the Amazon makes chopping down the rainforest more attractive, thus contributing to climate change. To the extent that foreign aid helps reduce these issues, it is also a way to combat internal issues. It may even prove to be a cost-efficient one, given the right implementation.

There's also the kind of self-interest where the 'enlightened'-label sits somewhat awkwardly: That of geopolitical influence. [This is a major motivation behind much of US foreign aid.](https://www.ft.com/content/14400aa2-c743-11e8-ba8f-ee390057b8c9) Countries like Pakistan are paid for their continued support for US foreign policy aims, under the guise of foreign aid. Thus, one should keep in mind that the foreign aid budgets one criticizes typically aren't all devoted to helping solve issues in foreign countries.

Both of these lines of argument leave plenty of room for criticism of the particular ways in which foreign aid is currently being employed with regards to efficiency, corruption, impact on local economies, and so on.",True,False,False,,0,1541082215,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e8ulpbo,False,t3_9t9k5p,True,t3_9t9k5p,/r/changemyview/comments/9t9k5p/cmv_countries_must_solve_its_internal_issues/e8ulpbo/,,1544865676,1,True,False,changemyview,t5_2w2s8,r/changemyview,public,

False,incendiaryblizzard,1465518787.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_yli62,False,"&gt;Indeed. The ""Oslo process"" as you call it began in the early 1990s. The settlement project began in the late 1960s. Construction of the settlements, some thought, would put pressure on the Palestinian side to make peace with Israel because the longer they waited to make peace, the more settlements would be constructed. Instead, the settlements were used as a ""stealing land"" brick in the victim narrative.

This is ahistorical. The settlements were never ever intended to put pressure on the Palestinians to reach a peace deal. They were always intended to 'steal land'. You are rewriting history. You can read what the settlers themselves said. You can read what Netanyahu said about this throughout this period. Its about Jews returning to their ancient home, to the the heart of Israel, the west bank. Its not about pushing for a two state solution and never was. You made this up. 

&gt;The comparison is apt. Like the Germans, the Palestinians launched a war with the goal of taking over a neighboring state, and like the Germans, they were utterly defeated and occupied. But unlike the Germans, they refuse to admit defeat and have instead spun history to make themselves into the victims. 

The Palestinians were not a 'neighbouring state'. Half of the population of the state of Israel (which was created the war started) was Palestinian. They were fighting for their own state, not to take a neighbouring state. And the Palestinians did admit defeat. Thats why they recognized Israel. Thats why they agreed to a state on 22% of mandatory Palestine. Thats called admitting defeat.

&gt;Imagine if the Nazis had done that and the fighting continued until this day. What a terrible place Europe would have been.

The Germans would have absolutely continued fighting if France decided that it would colonize Germany for generations and prevent the Germans from having a state or citizenship in any state. 

&gt;This is not only not true, but a very defeatist and thought terminating idea. Of course Israel wants peace, so does Palestine, they just both want it on their own terms. Demonization of one side does not help anyone. Netanyahu has said multiple times he wants a two state solution of a Jewish state alongside a Palestinian state. It's against the spirit of this sub entirely to claim one side or another 'doesn't want peace.'

Netanyahu says that he wants a state-minus for the Palestinians and at least 40 years of Israeli control over the Palestinian territories. Of course everyone wants peace, but they have other priorities first. The Americans fighting for independence also wanted peace, but independence was a priority and they would rather die than not have it. Its not demonization to say that someone has a priority other than peace. The Palestinians also have priorities that come before peace, for example independence and rights. Likud and Jewish home have the priority to settle the ancient jewish homeland of judea and samaria and all their actions have been to achieve that goal. Bennet wants peace but only in the situation where the Palestinians live in small autonomous zones under Israeli military control and where israelis can settle land around them freely. thats not demonization, thats literally his expressed objective.",True,False,False,,0,1541083854,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e8uniqu,False,t3_9t917c,False,t1_e8ulp3b,/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/9t917c/how_conflicts_end_and_what_makes_israelpalestine/e8uniqu/,,1544866512,9,True,False,IsraelPalestine,t5_2sgz7,r/IsraelPalestine,public,

&gt; Barnier must represent the EU27 and therefore has no flexibility.

Yup, the EU is a massive, monolithic, inflexible (and expensive) government that, by trying to satisfy the needs of everyone satisfies the needs of none. There would have been no referendum and no Brexit if the EU had had just a little bit of flexibility when David Cameron went and begged for changes and the EU said no. 

It's not an organisation I want to be a part of that can only keep members by punishing the ones that try to leave - kind of like the mafia. Agree that there will be massive cost on both sides - that is the point I made in my reply to the OP.

&gt;Additionally, the EU never was a primarily economic union in the first place. The foremost role of it is as a guarantor of peace and democracy on the continent. 

Strongly don't agree. The original inception of the EU was as the European *Economic* Community (EEC). It was supposed to be a trade zone. 

This is what the Brexiters feel strongly about: a massive, undemocratic government and court in Brussels that overrides the national policy of its members on everything from fisheries and agricultural policy, human rights and immigration. 

And it's a government that has stated its goal for ever increasing and centralised power: it's own currency, taxation policy, ever increasing powers for its courts; its own army for Christ's sake.

The lefties in the UK (of which I used to be one) like the EU because it is (supposedly) left wing. But, with the TTIP, policies toward Greece etc., the EU is increasingly neo-liberal and controlled by corporate interests. The point is that an undemocratic government is still undemocratic.

Complicating the decision is a recent attempt, allegedly sanctioned by Iranian government officials, to assassinate an Iranian dissident living in Denmark. The dissident was a branch leader of a movement in Iran known as the Arab separatist movement, or ASMLA. 

This article mentions the irony of Iran responding so harshly to the Khashoggi killing, rhetoric that will surely be used against them by Saudi Arabia and Israel as they're backing the sanctions against Iran.

&gt; Those various off-white groups, Jews, the Irish, Italians, Eastern  Europeans, etc. were whitened over time through the necessities of  anti-blackness. 

Jews are a genetically distinct population and usually identify as not white, so based on those two things I don't think they are white. Irish, Italians, and Eastern Europeans all are closely genetically clustered. Considering Europeans white doesn't necessarily have anything to do with ""anti-blackness"" and has never had that *denotation*. Maybe in some specific areas at some specific time periods it was used that way by some specific people (i.e. had that *connotation)*, but ""White"" and ""Black"" and ""Asian"" etc. are still used in the common parlance and no longer have those connotations.

&gt; The reason whiteness differs from blackness is because of this power relation 

Again, maybe in 1650, but not today. Someone can be proud of being white and have absolutely no thoughts on way or the other about ""blackness"" or non-whites. 

&gt;So having pride in being black stems from  having constructed a culture and an identity in the face of a  commodification system (Slavery) that worked overtime trying to ensure  that you didn't.  Blackness was imposed upon African people who had  their own cultural roots upturned, destroyed, oppressed, and controlled.  
&gt;  
&gt;Celebrating  black pride means you celelbrate the survival of something despite the  rape, pillage, murder, and enslavement of a continent.

Ridiculous just-so story with no evidence that is also factually questionable and misleading. Rewrite history all you want, doesn't make it true.

&gt; Celebrating white pride means you celebrate something made to justify  and defend the rape, pillage, murder and enslavement of a continent. 

This is laughable. White pride has to do with the history, culture, ancestry, etc. of whites, such as creating civilization as we know it and inventing 90% of technologies throughout most of history. I don't speak for everyone but neither do you, it's absurd to say that people who are proud of their White heritage are so because they are celebrating one end of some perceived dichotomy with Africa. 

If someone celebrates Arabic pride, is this also the case, since their slave trade was much bigger and they were generally much more cruel and brutal to their slaves? Oh wait, no, it's not, because they're not white so you'll come up with some story about how it's OK for them to be proud of their ethnicity as well. Rinse and repeat for every group except whites. Throughout history, every group of humans has done things to other groups that we now view as terrible. When you say that Whites can't be proud of who they are *today* because of *historical* cruelty from whites towards other groups, it's clear that you are either historically ignorant of the injustices committed within and among every group on Earth, or (more likely in my opinion) you're anti-White.",True,False,False,,0,1541088944,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e8uti5e,False,t3_9sydxy,True,t1_e8uf0zz,/r/forwardsfromgrandma/comments/9sydxy/fwd_from_grandpa_courtesy_of_my_daughter_my/e8uti5e/,,1544869316,-1,True,False,forwardsfromgrandma,t5_2t776,r/forwardsfromgrandma,public,

 SÃO PAULO (Reuters) - O juiz federal Sérgio Moro, responsável pela primeira condenação do ex-presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, deixará o posto de principal estrela da Lava Jato ao assumir o comando do Ministério da Justiça no governo do presidente eleito Jair Bolsonaro, em uma decisão que dará fôlego a críticos que apontam viés político em sua atuação como magistrado.

  Juiz Sérgio Moro 24/10/2018 REUTERS/Paulo Whitaker

 Moro, de 46 anos, já foi celebrado como herói —inclusive em montagens em que aparece como super-homem e sigla “SM” no peito—, e apontado por parcela significativa da população como ícone do combate à corrupção.

 Um estudioso da Operação Mãos Limpas, que combateu a corrupção na Itália na década de 1990, Moro fez comparações entre a operação italiana e a Lava Jato e, além de sua atuação no caso como juiz, também defendeu mudanças estruturais, incluindo no sistema político, para combater a corrupção.

 Apontado como possível nome para disputar o Palácio do Planalto neste ano, chegou a ter o nome incluído em pesquisas de intenção de voto antes de definidas as candidaturas, negou a possibilidade de entrar na vida política, alegando ter feito uma “opção pela magistratura”.

 “Eu fiz uma opção na minha carreira pela magistratura então não me vejo, e já disse mais de uma vez, e reitero quantas vezes forem necessárias, que não serei candidato, nada disso”, afirmou durante evento em 2017 em São Paulo.

 Ao aceitar o convite de Bolsonaro, no entanto, deixará a magistratura para trás, ao menos por ora, já que o presidente eleito também o apontou como provável indicado a uma vaga no Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF) quando uma das cadeiras ficar vaga, o que deve ocorrer em 2020, com a aposentadoria compulsória do ministro Celso de Mello.

 Especializado em crimes financeiros, Moro foi juiz do caso Banestado no início dos anos 2000, quando o doleiro Alberto Youssef, envolvido na Lava Jato, também foi um dos protagonistas e um dos que firmaram acordo de delação premiada com a Justiça.

 Antes de ganhar notoriedade nacional com a Lava Jato, Moro foi juiz auxiliar da ministra Rosa Weber, do STF, em 2012, durante o julgamento do caso conhecido como mensalão, numa época em que Rosa havia recém chegado ao Supremo oriunda da Justiça do Trabalho.

 Como juiz da Lava Jato, Moro teve embates frequentes durante audiências com a defesa de Lula, que por diversas vezes questionou juridicamente a suposta parcialidade do juiz.

 Em um dos casos, após encerrada a audiência com o zelador do prédio onde fica o tríplex atribuído a Lula, que depôs como testemunha no processo, Moro ironizou o fato de Lula ter processado o procurador da República Deltan Dallagnol, chefe da força-tarefa da Lava Jato em Curitiba, por conta de uma apresentação em power point em que acusou o petista de chefe de organização criminosa, indagando se a defesa processaria a testemunha.

 “Vai entrar com ação de indenização então contra ela (testemunha), doutor?”, perguntou ao advogado Cristiano Zanin Martins, que representa Lula.

 Zanin rebateu que ninguém estava acima da lei e indagou se |Moro estava advogando para o zelador. O juiz respondeu de forma sarcástica.

 “Está bom, doutor. Uma linha de advocacia muito boa”, ironizou. Ao que advogado de Lula respondeu também irônico: “Faço o registro de vossa excelência e recebo como um elogio.”

 O juiz foi alvo de críticas por conta do episódio em que divulgou nos autos do processo interceptações telefônicas de Lula com a então presidente Dilma Rousseff, e com outras autoridades com prerrogativa de foro, como o então ministro Jaques Wagner e o governador do Piauí, Wellington Dias, ação que contribuiu para a desestabilização da petista.

 Também foi novamente acusado de viés político quando tornou públicos trechos da delação premiada do ex-ministro Antonio Paloci a poucos dias do primeiro turno da eleição presidencial. Antes, o magistrado havia adiado o depoimento de Lula no processo do sítio de Atibaia para novembro, sob alegação de que o adiamento visava evitar exploração eleitoral.

 O papel central na Lava Jato também rendeu a Moro fama internacional. Ele foi condecorado por universidades estrangeiras, deu palestras no exterior e estampou capas de revistas internacionais, aclamado como um símbolo do combate à corrupção e ao fim da impunidade de poderosos no Brasil.

 Moro é casado com a advogada Rosangela Wolff Moro, criadora de uma página no Facebook em homenagem ao marido intitulada “Eu Moro com ele” e que comemorou a vitória de Bolsonaro no segundo turno das eleições presidenciais nas redes sociais. O casal tem dois filhos.

If all people got vaccinated, many illnesses would be extinct by now because a virus can't spread if there aren't enough ""hosts"".

&gt;It will probably be harder to get a visa when you don't have a related degree or work experience. Tech salaries are also much lower in Asia and Europe than they are in the US. Even Singapore tech salaries are considerably below US levels. It's probably better to get some experience in Silicon Valley if you end up pursuing a tech career. The tech sector in China is booming even more than the US, but it will difficult if you don't know the language.


Silicon Valley is closing up for those who aren't the absolute top talent. Despite there being dozens of companies coming out of incubators like YComb and others, the fact is these days if you aren't coming out of a top school it feels from the outside looking in absolutely impossible to find a job in the Valley. There's that, and the fact that personally I don't want to live there; it's too car centric and I can't drive.


&gt;Why not just work remotely from Asia? That's what I do. Even in mainland China, it's pretty easy to turn on the VPN and do the same programming work I do in the US. The timezone is a bit more annoying for working with the US, but that gets you the experience in Asia you want. You can also get a part time English teaching job in Asia, and use your extra free time to work on your remote programming work.


I'll definitely keep that idea in the front of my mind. Nominally the reasons I chose the Balkans were because of an easier time difference as well as the absence of lung-destroying pollution. Taiwan or Korea though would be very nice. Korea and Japan are high on my radar but I'm unsure of how I'd go about obtaining clients/local work without knowing the language to near fluency. English teaching in both places seems to be the preferred route to go despite wages being stagnant.

&amp;#x200B;

Tak!

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Lets start with the economy. Germany is the main market for Danish exports: Going off what i remember, we export goods total 58% of the Danish GDP, and Germany is by far the largest export market for us. So a lot of the economy is geared towards Germany - in that regard, Denmark is basically a northern extension of Germany, and in this regard we interact a lot. Far more than with Norway or Sweden, in fact.

&amp;#x200B;

Makes sense.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Then we have tourism: Every summer, countless Germans overrun Denmark (kinda like WW2 but this time with friendly intentions). Once again, they are number one in interaction in this regard. In fact, much [Danish tourist information](http://visitfanoe.dk/da/home/)(especially outside the big cities, such as this small island whose summertime population is more than doubled due to German tourists) has German before English - and a lot of the Danes working in German-favorited areas or close to the German border, speak passable German. Our main draw for the Germans tends to be nature, specifically beaches - we have more than double the coastline of Germany, and since most is within easy driving distance and not at all crowded, its an obvious destination for Germans.

This is mainly a personal observation, but i also think the Germans value the fact that Denmark is a fairly well-run country, just like their native Germany. Not a lot of south-european laissez-faire who-cares-if-youre-late here, but still a more down-to-earth and informal atmosphere than Germany.

&amp;#x200B;

I see.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Bottom line, your impression that Germany has closer interaction with their ""continental"" neighbours is correct, though. A lot of this is geography: We do share a border, yes, but most of the Danish population is actually quite far from the German border - unlike fx NL or CH, where the population centers are almost integrated with each other. The majority of Danes live on the islands, and that does indeed limit how close Germany feels - Sweden might be a quicker drive, even though the only land border is with Germany.

&amp;#x200B;

Makes sense.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Hope this answered your question, feel free to ask if theres more! Always nice to have foreign visitors on the sub.

&amp;#x200B;

It did. And I'll probably check in this sub occasionally to pose more questions in the near future in case I need to know something about Denmark again!

 O ex-árbitro de futebol Gutemberg de Paula Fonseca, que trabalhou na campanha de Wilson Witzel (PSC) para o Governo do Rio de Janeiro - Rafael Andrade - 10.jan.2012/Folhapress A estratégia digital que ajudou o ex-juiz [Wilson Witzel](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/10/ex-juiz-federal-witzel-derrota-paes-e-e-eleito-governador-do-rio-de-janeiro-projeta-datafolha.shtml) (PSC) a se tornar governador do Rio de Janeiro tem por trás outro ex-juiz que nunca usou uma toga.

 O coordenador da campanha digital do candidato, [Gutemberg de Paula Fonseca](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/esporte/19939-gutemberg-mostra-internet-como-prova.shtml), foi árbitro de futebol até 2012, quando abandonou o apito acusando o chefe da Comissão de Arbitragem da CBF (Confederação Brasileira de Futebol), Sérgio Corrêa, de manipular escalas dos juízes e sugerir ajuda ao Corinthians numa partida. O caso foi arquivado na Justiça Desportiva por falta de provas.

 Guto, como é chamado, foi incorporado à equipe do ex-juiz a 20 dias do primeiro turno. Foi o responsável por intensificar a campanha nas plataformas digitais —entre elas redes sociais— a fim de explorar a associação de Witzel com bandeiras do presidenciável Jair Bolsonaro (PSL).

 O candidato do PSC que aparecia num quarto pelotão de candidatos nas pesquisas de intenção de voto [deu uma arrancada na reta final](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/10/ex-juiz-witzel-ameaca-continuismo-de-20-anos-nas-eleicoes-do-rio-de-janeiro.shtml) do primeiro turno e obteve 41,28% dos votos válidos. No segundo, venceu a disputa com o ex-prefeito Eduardo Paes (DEM) com 59,87% dos votos válidos.

 ""Uma das estratégias foi mostrar que ele é da ideologia que o povo busca hoje: família, bons costumes. Ele foi militar, o Jair também. Ele é contra a criminalidade, o Jair também. Tivemos que levar essa informação [ao eleitor]"", afirmou ele.

 Uma das estratégias foi pagar anúncios no Google indicando o site de Witzel a usuários que fizessem buscas com o termo ""Bolsonaro"".

 De 2007 até janeiro de 2012, Guto acumulava funções públicas, tocava sua agência de publicidade e apitava jogos pelo país. Foi quando, após ser retirado do quadro da Fifa, atacou o presidente da Comissão Nacional de Arbitragem da CBF.

 Ele acusou Corrêa de corrupção. Disse que ele pediu, de forma indireta, favorecimento ao Corinthians num jogo do Brasileiro de 2010, e que sua exclusão da Fifa fora uma perseguição motivada pelas críticas que fazia ao comando da arbitragem nacional.

 As denúncias de influência nas arbitragens não se confirmaram. O Superior Tribunal de Justiça Desportiva as considerou ""desprovidas de veracidade e lógica"". Oito meses depois, ele pediu desculpas numa audiência judicial.

 ""No dia da audiência, o Edson Rezende [ex-presidente da comissão] pediu para acabar com isso. 'Deixa isso para lá, vamos seguir a vida'. E eu tenho admiração e respeito por ele. Atendi, pedi desculpas e paguei uma cesta básica"", disse ele, que reafirma a perseguição sofrida.

 Dez anos antes Guto já havia criado sua agência Yxe. Em 2002, atuou na campanha do coronel Heitor José de Souza, do antigo PFL, que acabou não eleito.

 Nos anos posteriores, ocupou cargos no estado na gestão Sérgio Cabral (MDB) em pastas destinadas ao PSC. Foi secretário municipal em Japeri, na Baixada Fluminense, e chefe de gabinete do vereador Fernando Moraes, à época no PR, que se tornou seu último contato com o poder público.

 Guto se aproximou da família Bolsonaro em 2017 por meio do deputado estadual eleito [Rodrigo Amorim](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/10/candidato-que-quebrou-placa-em-homenagem-a-marielle-e-o-mais-votado-para-alerj.shtml) (PSL), amigo de longa data.

 Após a eleição de 2016, em que Amorim foi candidato a vice-prefeito na chapa encabeçada por Flávio Bolsonaro (PSL), foi procurado para ajudar como voluntário na comunicação e imagem do grupo com vistas a esta eleição.

 Neste pleito, estava focado na campanha de Amorim e auxiliava a do senador eleito Flávio. A 20 dias da votação do primeiro turno, foi chamado a integrar a equipe do ex-juiz.

 Paes tentou explorar no segundo turno o fato de Witzel ser pouco conhecido do eleitorado, apesar dos 3,1 milhões de votos que havia obtido. Comparou o adversário ao prefeito Marcelo Crivella (PRB), mal avaliado, apontando a necessidade de experiência para governar o estado.

 ""Esse foi o grande erro dele. O Paes bateu numa tecla que refletia nele. Se fosse uma outra figura, poderia dar certo. O problema é que existem muitos percalços que o Eduardo atravessou que a população naturalmente buscou"", afirmou Guto.

 ""Nessa eleição, quem deu o cartão vermelho foi o eleitor"", disse o ex-árbitro.

For reference, I just started my treatment (day 3, 37 trays, switching every 5 days). Here's what my orthodontist told me: Since the treatment is relatively hands off from an orthodontic perspective (especially 4-6 months in), then it shouldn't be a problem provided you're able to return now and then for check-ups and any additional treatments. In my case, I have family here, so I'd likely be coming back a few times anyway, so I'll just align those visits with my treatment dates. I will also do check-ups via Skype so they can get a sense of how I'm managing and how things are moving. If you don't plan on coming back, that probably changes your options.

I live in the Pacific Northwest and, apparently, treatment like this is not uncommon here. My orthodontist will do Invisalign for fishermen who will be up in Alaska or out-to-sea for extended periods.

Nike at this point isn't even a clothier in my opinion, but more of a supply chain management corporation that happens to make apparel ;) It's really expensive to put stuff together, but what people don't get is that it's better to buy a $300 jacket that's going to last through 3-5 winters than a new $30 hoodie that's going to have to be replaced each season. 

But you're going up against the forces of fast fashion here. People are used to getting stuff on the cheap and getting it fast, but those people aren't going to be your customer. Your customer is going to be someone that understands that the good stuff costs a little more and they're going to be willing to wait a little longer to get it.

The advice I can give you is to acquaint yourself with the differences between Asian cuts and European cuts. You're a bigger guy so you've probably run into what my husband lovingly calls the ""Danny DeVito Problem"". Clothing cut to Asian specifications are made for people with short torsos (and short legs, just short everything which is great for me but horrible for him), so when they size up the cut gets wider but the garment stays short. If you've ever bought something from Europe you've probably noticed that the garment runs long to fit a longer torso, and the arms are longer too! But European cuts can be a bit slim so you're going to have some troubleshooting ahead of you. If you ever get to a point with outsourcing labor make sure you keep an eye on this though, I've seen so many problems with cuts and it can make or break your business.

That's not a valid conclusion, since they could be religious/atheist, have learning disabilities or not, be able-bodied or not, come from broken homes or not, have worked on the side or not, be LGBT or not, be QIA+ or not, etc. Assuming you mean racially diverse, the replacement group might nonetheless happen to be more similar on the whole if their lived experiences are more similar.

There is no proof that whites are a homogenous group, like there is no indication that blondes are, blacks are, or autistic paraplegic latino transwoman lesbians are. It's therefore impossible to prove that racial (or similar) diversification always creates more diverse ideas than diversification based on age, social class, job experience, etc. Claiming that shared traits for population groups based on immutable characteristics outnumber the differences between any two individuals is one or several of bigotry, magical thinking, bias of low expectations, sexism, racism, etc.

&gt;  It's also safe to assume that an algorithm that tagged pictures of black people as gorillas would have been less likely to be released to the general public if it had been worked on by black engineers.

Probably, but it would depend on other factors like QA processes, the amount of inspection done on the algorithm's classifications and the amount of fine-tuning done. I don't know enough about that particular case to decide resoundingly.

&gt; Cool, have you heard of the replication crisis? Turns out it exists in the hard sciences as well.

Whataboutism. The campaign by James Lindsay, Peter Boghossian and Helen Pluckrose I linked shows serious problems with the entire fields of sociology and gender/sex/women's/queer/X studies, which happen to be the ones leading the debate on ""social justice"".

&gt; Undoubtedly a diverse group of people who all went to an Ivy League school will still have had a different experience to a bunch of white guys who went to Ivy League school. 

Diverse does not mean ""not cis-man white hetero"", period.

&gt; The white guys will never have had to experience racism or sexism, for a start.

Words like racism and sexism don't care what race or sex you have. Claiming otherwise is nonsense and ideologically based, as well as ignorant of American history. Racism against Italians and the Irish is well-documented. In a European context, so is the persecution of Jews and Roma (both white). When it comes to sexism, ask men working in nurseries and nursing or going through custody battles or false allegations of domestic abuse. It's not because different groups don't experience discrimination in equal amounts that the least discriminated against suffer none.

Humans are individuals and the cumulative sum of their biology and experiences. Making a value judgement based on just one aspect is oversimplification and bigotry - specialised in racism or sexism as it might be. It's odd that has to be explained nowadays.

Title: **eBay refusing to delete my account**

Original Post: 

&gt; I received an email informing me my account was suspended, but couldn't provide any details, but I would, in the form of driving license bank statement and and utility bills. I called them to clarify as I assumed this was a scam, but, it was in fact correct! so after explaining to them, I would be unable to provide these details (because I don't trust eBay not because I don't have them). I asked them to delete my account, to which I was told we can't do that!!! 
&gt; 
&gt; I was under the impression that EU dictates that when a customer asked for his/her account and details to be permanently deleted they have to by law confirm. 
&gt; 
&gt; I am basically asking if I would be able to go to court to have my account and details removed as they are refusing to do so otherwise. 
&gt; 
&gt; thanks in advance

False,blackmagic70,1263863341.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_3u0to,False,"Aweakness of Brexiteers has been failing to spell out a clear alternative to membership of the European Union. One such option is Norway’s model, outside the eu but inside its single market. Both the government and Parliament have rejected the idea of joining Norway in the European Economic Area (eea). But it has been revived in a new form by Nick Boles, a Tory mp. His “Norway for now” plan is backed by fellow Tories like Nicky Morgan and Labour mps such as Frank Field.

The benefits of the eea lie in keeping the single market but escaping the eu’s farm and fisheries policies and the direct jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. The drawbacks are becoming a rule-taker in that market and accepting free movement of people from the eu, as well as paying into its budget. eea countries can strike third-country trade deals, but as they are not in a customs union with the eu, membership does not by itself remove the need for border controls, which Britain has promised to avoid in Northern Ireland.

Mr Boles is clear that his plan works only if Parliament rejects a Brexit deal put to it by Theresa May. But he puts the probability of the prime minister’s deal failing as high as 50%. And he does not see a parliamentary majority emerging for a second referendum, which Mrs May is firmly against. For all sides, he says, Norway for now would surely be preferable to a no-deal Brexit. He has also changed his original idea of fixing a three-year time limit in the eea before moving towards a Canada-style free-trade deal. Now he talks merely of “temporary” membership while some alternative is negotiated.

His idea faces formidable practical and legal obstacles. Businesses would not welcome having to adapt twice to Brexit. Switching horses this late in the negotiations would be awkward. Brexit is less than 150 days away, but to join the eea requires accession to the European Free Trade Association (efta), a process that could take months or years. Mr Boles reckons there are ways round this, but concedes that his plan may also require a transition. That would only add to the uncertainties facing business.

Temporary membership of the eea would be hard to sell to others. The eea countries have said they would welcome Britain as a permanent member. But as Erna Solberg, Norway’s prime minister, put it diplomatically when she met Mrs May in Oslo this week, joining with the declared intention of leaving a few years later would be “a little bit difficult” for other members.

Then there is the Irish border. efta/eea membership may make it legally hard to be in a customs union with the eu. And that may make it impossible to drop the Northern-Ireland-only backstop that Mrs May is resisting in the Brexit withdrawal deal. Mr Boles suggests that some form of associate membership of the eea could allow the creation of a temporary customs union with the eu, but many in Brussels disagree.

Last is the issue of free movement of people. eea and efta members must accept this as a principle, a big reason why Brexiteers oppose their model. Continued free movement is an argument for doubting if the Norway model is sustainable for Britain in the long run. Yet there are ways to limit free movement, and net migration from eu countries has also fallen sharply since 2016.

Norway for now is under attack from ardent Leavers and Remainers alike. But that could make it a compromise. For all its problems, it would be foolish to rule it out amid the chaos of a parliamentary rejection of a Brexit deal this winter.

You will hear some newer stuff on the radio and Pandora, Spotify, whatever, but sometimes to hear that new Christmas stuff you need to go out and buy Christmas CDs/albums by specific artists. 

Another commenter mentioned that these songs can suck--that's absolutely true. I've heard a few that were really good. Weird Al has done some great ones, with original lyrics, not original music. A lot of it is awful though. We're talking like maybe one or two good songs on an entire album that you paid for. 

John Lennon's Happy Xmas War is Over is an example of a Christmas song that is quite a bit newer(20-ish years or more) than a lot of the Christmas music you traditionally hear on the radio and nothing like traditional Christmas music. A lot of the stuff you hear on the radio comes from the 1950s, Bing Crosby, etc.. 

There is also some sad song that comes on the radio at Christmas time about some kid who wants to buy her dying mother some shoes and doesn't have any money, which is fairly new in the grand scheme of Christmas songs but seems to have become a Christmas staple. 

Some of the traditional Christmas songs are very old, we're talking two and three centuries, maybe even more in cases where we might have carried something over from the middle ages or the era of all those competing composers in Europe, like the songs from Handel's Messiah. We like what's familiar.

Patch 1.8 - Match Making Issues + Thoughts/Ideas
u/TTShazy
This patch is so bad (off to a good start)
****
I disagree. I think this patch is brilliant with the changes. Now is there more work to do like addressing Cassie burst and Strix infinite flare? Yes. But small steps first. If you know game design... you never do everything~ at once since that could lead to unforeseen effects that are then too hard to pinpoint down. 
****
.... in lower elo the only way to carry 4 players playing worse than bots was to use a broken champion like willo, now you reduced the potential of solo carry (or better, the champion pool that can solo carry).
****
Willo is still good though...? 

And you can carry with a majority of damage and flank heroes. Certain supports can also carry such as Furia and potentially Ying and Jenos. 

But there are other heroes to try and you can keep using Willo. Like Viktor had his shrapnel nerf but will that stop people from using him? Nope~ I'm still a Viktor main and that talent is still very strong. 
****
Matchmaking is disgusting and nothing is done about it. I hear people say ""just have fun it's a game"" then they proceed to lock in moji and run it down, die and then hide because they are useless.

You create the dilemma of, Do i pick Moji/Lex because low elo players cant kill them or do i pick androxus/evie to Learn the flanks that have the most of potential? do i pick willo or drogoz? kinessa/strix or tyra/victor?
****
Umm... you pick based on what you're good at or want to play...? In fact if you were decent enough you could play whatever and still carry so this dilemma shouldn't exactly exist. Like say you main Willo and are good enough to influence games. Regardless of who picks what... just go Willo and do well~

This isn't a matchmaking system issue as much as apparently a low elo player issue imo. The matchmaking isn't perfect but it's far from terrible from my experiences. My only complaint is when I queue with my friend who's like half my elo... his elo is ignored and instead we get high elo only while he's the only one with his elo range. I wished it tried to make a mirror of his elo on the enemy team but it's whatever~

But anyway what you described is elo meta issues...? And that's just due to the players themselves and not the game itself. 
****
For The Matchmaking In Ranked (i recommend): RESTRICT RANKED FOR LOW LEVEL PLAYERS + USE OLD METHOD: you gotta be #z LVL and have #x champions over #y LVL to play or something similar (just in case: you must be over lvl 30 and have 15 champs over lvl 12)
****
I don't disagree here and this is a fair point. Maybe increasing requirements might help but~ realize not too many people play ranked so this will hurt that lower number even more. Personally I think it's fine as of now but maybe making rank harder to access might help. Not sure~
****
Put ROLE PREFERENCES like LoL. 3 of them (or more) NOT 2, excample 1) Supp Flank Range 2) Tank Flank Blaster 3)Flank Supp Antifrontline, come up with stuff. Like - You gotta know 3 roles to play ranked?
****
This would help but~ you run into queue time issues plus who's to say the meta is x roles? What if the meta becomes like... 3 damage and no flanks? Or 3 flanks and no damage?

So role queue helps but... roles are super flexible. That or combine the damage and flank role to like... just a damage category. But as you can see that gets tricky. So imo it's fine to not include a role queue. 
****
In casuals: calculate mmr by looking at winrates, kda, dmg output. You say kda means nothing but it means Great Positioning + Understanding Of The Game (ult cooldowns, engage time, etc).
****
Paladins.guru. The game already does that. I have a friend with the same win rate as me or so and yet I'm 2x the elo due to I'm guessing performance differences. So yes... casual elo accounts for other stats. 
****
- Also i wanna point out that, i had 10 game win streak, and the 11th i was queued up with Silvers. How can a 10 game win streak not rise the MMR? what was my mmr before? because that scares me... one time i queue VS Bugzy Tenner and Unbe (they were in a party ,while i was playing solo) and then the other game with silver players?? I get depressed every time due to the ignorance and the uselessness of low elo players and ""have fun guys"".

HOW IS MMR CALCULATED? IS THERE MMR? WHY DO I HAVE GRANDMASTERS FROM NA/BRAZIL IN MY EU SERVER RANK LIST? DO THEY AFFECT MY MATCHMAKING TOO?
****
If you play at a certain time with no players on... the system grabs whoever is left. So that means silver + masters vs silver + masters or bronze and master vs diamonds. 
****
i need awnsers not a new moji skin after nerfing him to the ground nor 4 DJ skins for champions that have alot of skins already. Bugfixes/FPS drop rate fixes for champs isn't fixed + You release a NEW FEATURE where the enemy champions skins will probably MESS UP THE FPS due to unique animated skins! NICE IDEA GUYS, next make hyper animated mounts and increase particles because you know, making us stop playing/lag/buy a 1,5k $ pc is better than fixing tha game is better, right? spend money on artists instead of devs or whatever...
****
Lowest option disables a lot of particle effects. Try that out.

During the Crusades copies of those writing were sent back to Europe.  The vast system of monasteries and proto-universities that the Church had built eagerly translated and dispersed those writings.  
  
The Muslim world took up a lot of the old Hellenic empire of Alexander the Great and they embraced that heritage.  To that end they kept Greek thought.  Early Islam had many scholars and centers of learning like Damascus and Cordoba.  This was because the Muslim world was still largely populated by Christians and the implications of the principles of Islam hadn't been worked out.  
  
But when the Christian world got these writings, they fit right in because Christianity originated in the Greco-Roman world.  Paul would have known them almost as well as he knew Jewish scripture.  The Scholastics synthesized Greek and Christian writing to produce what we call ""The West"".  There was an intellectual explosion both in terms of philosophy/theology and practical technology.  
  
Christians were in constant contact with the Muslim world due to the crusader states, wars, and raids.  The reasoning of theology going in in Christendom prompted the Muslims to answer similar questions.  They answered them differently.  Christians founded science, Muslims embraced occasionalism which undercuts science.  Thus the paths diverged.

**Net Profit: +8.92 Units (4k Starting balance - $100 units)**

**Yesterday's Pick**: **NHL - Pittsburgh Penguins ML @ NY Islanders @ 1.66 - 3 UNITS - 7PM EST L**

Unfortunate loss on Pittsburgh yesterday. Came down to a shootout and the Pens couldn't come through where they normally thrive. We only out shot the Islanders 31-26 this game anyway, so the offense didn't do as much as we hoped for, but Murray definitely bounced back and had a good game. Sorry for the loss boys. On to this next one.

**Today's Pick**: **Soccer - France Ligue 1 - PSG vs Lille - PSG Over 2.5 goals @ 1.72 - 2 UNITS - 3:45 PM EST**

**Pick Explanation:** Although I normally make picks in the NBA/NHL/NFL, I also do follow a little bit of Soccer in European leagues and did some good research on this pick before making it. Currently PSG are obviously 1st overall in Ligue 1 (11W -0D-0L) and Lille are having a stunning season (8W-1D-2L) being second in the table. PSG are averaging over 3.5 goals per game and are absolutely dominating the league. They cannot be stopped - and although Lille have only conceded 8 goals on the season, they haven't even faced a team half as good as PSG. They haven't faced Lyon yet who are one of the better teams below PSG. Also Lille have had some struggles away this season, where PSG are playing in great form at home. The key point to this bet is that Lille's success this season has come from incredible chemistry and performance by their young strikers. Their offense is performing better than ever and when they are faced against a team like PSG who will control the game, that offensive ability will diminish and I don't think they will be able to prevent PSG from scoring 3 goals at the very least. The over on the game in general isn't a bad idea either, but my POTD is just on PSG over 2.5 because I don't trust that Lille will get enough opportunities.

On bnet, there are 4 realms. Us east, us west, Asia, and Europe. the realms have different populations, peak hours, and active game types. Europe has the most, about 3x the population of west or east.

Europe: 1v1 queue is generally &lt;1m whatever time; 2v2 queue &lt;1m during peak hours, able to find a game most other times; 3v3 dead; 4v4 can find game any time of day;

East: 1v1 &lt;2m during peak. Off peak I generally don’t have patience to wait, will queue on Europe with 200 ping;

2v2 - only during peak; 4v4 - can generally find a game at any time

West: Same as above, but 4v4 is also harder to find off peak

False,ScreamOfVengeance,1499780049.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_pcal0y,False,"THE BREXITEERS have become the angry brigade of British politics. Boris Johnson has accused Theresa May of wrapping a suicide vest around Britain. Jacob Rees-Mogg has accused her of being “cowed” by the European Union. And several Tory MPs have used anonymous briefings to savage her in the press. “The moment is coming when the knife gets heated, stuck in her front and twisted,” declared one conspirator who is probably more familiar with “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” than the complete works of Edmund Burke. “She’ll be dead soon.”

The obvious reason for this is that Brexiteers think that Mrs May is wrecking a project that has consumed much of their lives. They are furious that she botched the election of 2017 with a wooden campaign and a shoddy manifesto. This has weakened the government’s hand in dealing not only with recalcitrant Remainers but also with cunning Europeans who are determined to exploit any sign of British weakness. They are equally cross that she is betraying what they consider to be the glorious principles of Lancaster House, the speech in which she laid down various “red lines” about leaving the European Union.

There is a lively debate about why Mrs May has done this. Was she always going to betray them? (She voted to remain before briefly becoming the Boudica of Brexit.) Or was she corrupted by establishment types such as Olly Robbins, the civil servant in charge of the negotiations? Or was she simply ground down by European bureaucrats? That she is a traitor is now taken as a given.

There is also a deeper reason why Brexiteers are so angry. Mrs May represents the reality principle in a political world dominated by fantasy and wish-fulfilment. She didn’t fluff last year’s election only because of a wooden campaign and a botched manifesto. She also fluffed it because a more or less equally divided nation was not willing to give her carte blanche to pursue a hard Brexit. She didn’t blur the red lines of Lancaster House just because she was manipulated and deceived. She blurred them because she is trying to avoid terrible hazards such as a breakdown of trade with the EU or the imposition of a hard border in Ireland. Irving Kristol, the godfather of neo-conservatism, described his tribe as liberals who have been mugged by reality. Brexiteers are Tories who are furious that reality has proved to be more stubborn than they imagined.

They believed that leaving the European Union would be a cake walk. Liam Fox pronounced that “the free-trade agreement that we will have to do with the EU should be one of the easiest in human history.” John Redwood averred that “getting out of the EU can be quick and easy—the UK holds most of the cards in any negotiation.” In fact, leaving the EU is likely to be one of the hardest bureaucratic exercises in post-war history. That is not just because the EU is determined to make it difficult (though it is), but because unravelling 45 years’ worth of trading regulations is inevitably complicated and time-consuming.

The Brexiteers believed that Britain would be able to have all the benefits of the single market while also striking trade deals with the rest of the world—that “there will be no downside to Brexit, only a considerable upside,” as David Davis said, or that Britain would be able to have its cake and eat it, as Mr Johnson pronounced in a phrase that should be carved on his tombstone. But leaving the EU inevitably involves difficult trade-offs. Britain has to choose between maintaining open access to the EU’s single market (which means complying with its rules) or freeing itself to make independent trade deals with the rest of the world (which means losing automatic access to the EU’s market). It may yet have to make an even harder trade-off within its own borders: treating Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK, which would eventually tie the province more closely to the Republic of Ireland, or accepting a soft Brexit.

The Brexiteers further believed that the EU would prove to be a pushover. During the referendum campaign, Michael Gove promised that “the day after we vote to leave we hold all the cards and we can choose the path we want.” In fact, the EU not only has a lot more cards in its pack than Britain—27 member states, including aces such as France and Germany. It also has more experience, as a regulatory superpower that is used to dealing with other superpowers such as China and America. Some Brexiteers also thought that Britain would be the praetorian guard of a revolution against an ossified global order, represented by Brussels. In fact, the EU has arguably been strengthened rather than weakened by Britain’s imminent departure, while pro-Europeanism has gone from being an exotic taste in Britain to a real force. And Britain’s fellow rebels against the old world order consist of such dubious figures as Matteo Salvini and Donald Trump.

The new moaners

There is an element of vanity in this. Many Brexiteers spent decades in the wilderness, being dismissed as “swivel-eyed loons” by senior Tories. They thought that the referendum result would finally turn them into prophets and heroes. But it is increasingly looking as if the establishment types got it right. Preparations for a no-deal Brexit are becoming increasingly ominous, as the government prepares to charter container ships to import food and drugs, and turn a Kent motorway into a giant lorry park.

There are two very different ways that you can react to reality when it turns out to be harsher than you expected. You can recognise reality for what it is, and try to render it a bit more palatable by hard work and careful thought. Or you can rage against it—and bolster your rage with talk about ideals betrayed and simple solutions denied. Mrs May is no one’s model of a perfect prime minister. But it is to her credit that she has tried hard to grapple with a fiendishly difficult problem. And it is to the discredit of Brexiteers that, rather than helping Mrs May to do her duty, they have decided to rage against her.",True,False,False,,0,1541107765,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e8vhp8c,True,t3_9tdp8x,True,t3_9tdp8x,/r/ukpolitics/comments/9tdp8x/brexiteers_are_angry_not_just_with_theresa_may/e8vhp8c/,,1544880623,3,True,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,r/ukpolitics,public,

&gt; Johann (Hans) Hölzel (19 February 1957 – 6 February 1998), better known by his stage name Falco, was an Austrian rap, pop and rock musician and had four #1 Hits - ""Der Kommissar"", ""Rock Me Amadeus"", ""Jeanny"" and ""Coming Home (Jeanny Part 2, Ein Jahr danach)"". 

&gt; He is the only artist to score a #1 Hit in the U.S. with a German language song, and his albums and singles have sold about 60 million copies worldwide.

&gt; 
Early Years

&gt; Born in Vienna, studying at the Vienna Music Conservatory in 1977 which he left after one semester to pursue a career in music, he lived for a short time in West Berlin while singing in a jazz-rock band. When he returned to Vienna he was calling himself ""Falco,"" reportedly in tribute to the East German ski jumper Falko Weißpflog, and playing in the Austrian bands Spinning Wheel and Hallucination Company. En route to becoming an international rock star in his own right, he was bass player in the Austrian hard rock-punk rock band Drahdiwaberl (from 1978 until 1983). With Drahdiwaberl he wrote and performed the song ""Ganz Wien"" which he would also include on his debut solo album Einzelhaft.

&gt; 
Individual success

&gt; Falco's first hit was ""Der Kommissar"" from the 1982 album Einzelhaft. A German language song about drug consumption that combines rap verses with a sung chorus, Falco's record was a number-one success in many countries but failed to break big in the U.S. The song, however, would prove to have a life of its own in two English-language versions. British Rock band After the Fire recorded an English cover version, loosely based on Falco's lyrics and also called ""Der Kommissar"" (with ""uh-oh"" and ""alles klar Herr Kommissar"" the only other lyrics held over from the original). This time, the song shot to number three in the United States (their only major hit there) in 1983, though it failed to crack the UK Top 40. The band - who had been together more than a decade - broke up almost immediately thereafter. That same year, American singer Laura Branigan recorded a version of the song with new English lyrics, under the title ""Deep in the Dark"" on her album Branigan 2.

&gt; After a second album, Junge Roemer, failed to provide a repeat to his debut single's success (outside of Austria and Germany, where the album topped the charts), Falco began to experiment with English lyrics in an effort to broaden his appeal, and chose a new production team. The result would be the most popular album and single of his career.

&gt; Falco recorded ""Rock Me Amadeus"" inspired in part by the Oscar-winning film Amadeus, and the song became a worldwide hit in 1986. This time, his record reached #1 in the U.S. and UK, bringing him the success that had eluded him in that major market a few years earlier. The song remained in the top spot of the Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks and his album, Falco 3, fittingly peaked at the number three position on the Billboard album charts. Unheard of at the time for a white performer, much less a European one, the Austrian rapper's single climbed to the upper reaches of the Billboard Top R&amp;B Singles Chart (only a few years earlier called the ""Black Singles"" chart), peaking at number 6. Falco 3 peaked at number 18 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums charts. Ultimately, ""Rock Me Amadeus"" went to the #1 spot in over a dozen countries including the Soviet Union and Japan. Follow-up single ""Vienna Calling"" was another international pop hit, peaking at #18 of the Billboard Charts and #17 on the U.S. Cash Box Charts in 1986. A double A-side 12"" single featuring remixes of those two hits peaked at #4 on the U.S. Dance/Disco charts.

&gt; ""Jeanny"" the third release from the album Falco 3, brought the performer back to the top of the charts across Europe. Highly controversial when it was released in Germany and the Netherlands, the story of ""Jeanny"" was told from the point of view of a rapist and possible murderer. Several DJs and radio stations refused to play the ballad, which was ignored in the U.S., although it became a huge hit in many European countries, and inspired two sequels on later albums.

&gt; In 1986, the album Emotional was released, produced by Rob and Ferdi Bolland (Bolland &amp; Bolland). On the Album were ""Coming Home (Jeanny Part 2, Ein Jahr danach)""  and the song ""Kamikaze Cappa"" which was written as a tribute to the late photojournalist Robert Capa. ""The Sound of Musik"" was another international success, and a Top 20 U.S. Dance hit, though he failed to make the U.S. pop charts. He also went on ""Emotional-Tour"" which was a world tour where he ended up in Japan at 1987. In 1987, he sang a duet with Brigitte Nielsen ""Body Next to Body"" and the single was a Top 10 hit in the Germanic countries. The Album Wiener Blut was released in 1988 but it did not get much publicity outside Germany and Austria.

&gt; After ""Jeanny,"" there were a number of European hits, but Falco was rarely heard in the U.S. and the UK. His 1992 U.S. comeback attempt, the album Nachtflug with the song ""Titanic"" won a number of awards, but failed to chart in America.

&gt; 
Death

&gt; Falco died of severe injuries received from a collision with a bus in his Mitsubishi Pajero near the city of Puerto Plata, in the Dominican Republic on 6 February 1998, just two weeks before his 41st birthday. While it was initially reported that the autopsy showed high blood levels of alcohol and cocaine, this was disputed. At the time of his death, he was working on a comeback into the music world.
He was buried in the Zentralfriedhof (Central Cemetery) in Vienna, Austria.

&gt; Years active: 1974 -1998

The princes of Germany are who protected Luther and stole the fool away from his last meeting with the Papacy, because the princes knew they would kill him. So the ""kidnapped"" him so to speak, to start the Bible printing process as Reform churches began to spring up in the wake. But, a case in point, the secular reaction was one of ""Enlightenment"" by anything but Christendom religion, that was the  spark of the Renaissance. Thus, where the pieces fall in a reaction to organized heresy in Christendom, is a case study of Europe up to and after the 1500s. You just don't know where the pieces may fall, but it was the end of the 1000 year reign of the Papacy. It was called the ""Dark Ages"" as Catholocism was the ""light"", actually a blackhole that governed them ""Dark Ages"".

I cannot see a situation in which the UK financial sector is stronger outside of EU, they simply have no control over European decisions, but since they still want access to European markets they have to follow their rules.  However, in future anomalies like Euro clearing becoming concentrated outside a euro country, are not going to be tolerated.

Preserving the dominance of London as a financial centre is not a concern of the EU anymore.  Whether Paris or Frankfurt are ever as dominant as London has been is doubtful, but irrelevant.  If there is a bigger slice of the pie to be had at Londons expense, well Britain isn't in the EU anymore to argue against it and wants out of the institution that ensures the UK wasn't penalised for being a non-euro country within said institution, or that the aforementioned institution is actually following its own rules (ECJ).",True,False,False,,0,1541111214,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e8vlshh,False,t3_9t9bx9,True,t1_e8vjllx,/r/ukpolitics/comments/9t9bx9/michel_barnier_misleading_press_articles_today_on/e8vlshh/,,1544882528,2,True,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,r/ukpolitics,public,

Correct. But when there's a bloody great desert that puts the Sahara to shame bordering one of them, one has to wonder if 'northern' might not be somewhat relative.

It has Polish monsters running around, I'll grant you. But I didn't read anyone praying to Thor. So I have to disagree on the 'they share a mythology' statement.

Adaptations change stuff. GoT changed characters' eye colour, hair colour, and - yes - race. LoTR didn't have those with Numenorean blood (Aragorn, Boromir, Faramir etc) running around with raven hair and grey eyes. Hell, they even cut out the rest of the Dunedain.

&gt; skin but most importantly the all of the people living in that medieval era subcontinent should reasonable have the same race

Why? The human civilisation of the Witcher world didn't evolve naturally, it's an outside influence that arrived with the Conjunction of the Spheres. Who's to say who/what mix of ethnicities crossed over?

And who's to say - culturally - that humans of different skin tones wouldn't intermingle? It happened in the Roman era (and the Medieval too, in certain parts of Europe) and that was without numerous other sentient races for us to fight against, instead of turning on ourselves and isolating ourselves.

Polish people especially in Western Europe are constantly discriminated against, half the anti immigration groups in England were set up over negative sentiment towards Eastern European immigrants.

You have an extremely US centric viewpoint. Which Black ethnic group are you talking about? The Zulu, Xhoti , Bantu, Hutu.

False,Wallabystyle,1322584220.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_6c4cy,False,"OP, pelos seus posts você parece ser uma pessoa bem esclarecida e madura, apesar da pouca idade.

Nunca faça o ""elas ou eu"". JAMAIS. Nunca pense nessa possibilidade. Deixe-a livre para que ela faça o que quiser. Sempre que ela for, ela vai voltar pra você. Isso eu te garanto. Jamais fique em posição inferior socialmente. Não implore para que ela volte e não jogue-a contra a parede. Não a force a nada.

Procure sempre dar o exemplo e busque seu próprio desenvolvimento. Incentive-a a também buscar o desenvolvimento pessoal.

A minha experiência mostra que quanto mais a pessoa se desenvolve, mais a pessoa passa a ser deslocada, tanto de suas amizades, quanto junto às pessoas de seu relacionamento - sobretudo se essas não se desenvolvem. 

Assim, considerando que você se desenvolva pessoalmente, seu futuro com ela terá duas hipóteses:

1. Sem o desenvolvimento pessoal dela, o deslocamento entre vocês dois se torna tão grande que um relacionamento entre os dois não será proveitoso para você e nem para ela. - Nesta hipótese, apesar de perder uma companheira e ficar triste inicialmente,  você ficará mais feliz, a longo prazo, de forma que poderá encontrar alguém melhor para você.

2. Ela se desenvolve junto com você e acaba muito deslocada das ""amigas"" que pouco se desenvolveram. Nessa hipótese, a sua namorada automaticamente se distanciará dessas companhias por seu deslocamento e continuará a caminhada com você. 

É muito difícil reencontrar um grande amigo ou uma ex-namorada que você não vê há tempos e perceber que vocês já não têm mais nada em comum. Mas é isso que acontece. Isso é natural.
 quanto mais você lê e estuda, mais insuportável fica de conviver com os idiotas.﻿

Então, você não deve sofrer por medo de perdê-la. Caso ela seja influenciada pelas amigas e termine com você ou resolva te trair, você irá sofrer inicialmente, mas precisa ter mentalidade de que você se livrou daquilo, sobretudo porque a pessoa com quem você namorava não era exatamente a pessoa que você achava que era. Você perderá a admiração e aquilo, de uma forma ou de outra, te beneficiará.

Contudo, de toda forma, a ideia  é você se tornar uma pessoa muito mais valorosa que as amigas. Assim, mantendo a admiração por você e percebendo a distância entre elas e você, a sua namorada automaticamente fará uma escolha que no fim será vantajoso para você.

Nunca se preocupe em demasia com as coisas que você não consegue controlar, apenas siga sua vida.

De toda sorte, caso deseje ""tentar salvar"" a sua namorada das más companhias de forma mais a curto prazo, o que pode não ter tanta eficácia quanto a forma que falei acima, sugiro que você traga-a mais para o seu mundo. Faça atividades juntos, apresente amigos, arrume programas a quatro com um casal de amigos. Faça programas culturais divertidos. Viaje. Traga ela para seus amigos.

Se ela quiser sair com as amigas, deixe-a. Saia com seus amigos ou fique estudando. Não reclame delas e não fique atrás dela. Deixe que ela sinta sua falta e que te veja com valor. Não pegue o celular dela, não se importe com o que as amigas dizem de você, se mostre superior. Apenas mostre posição se perguntado, de forma firme, porém desinteressada.

Reafirme, sempre que ela se mostrar insegura, o seu amor por ela - de forma não necessitada -, mas saiba a hora de deixar ela com medo de te perder.



De toda sorte, se você quer sinceridade, OP, apenas pela sua breve narrativa e pelos seus comentários, eu percebi que você é uma pessoa com muito potencial e com muito valor, enquanto sua namorada está ficando para trás: está se relacionando com ""pessoas âncoras"", cuja amizade pouco vale. Se ela vê algum relacionamento possível com essas pessoas, isso é um indicativo ""red flag"". 
Na minha experiência pessoal e por ter visto muitos amigos meus passando por algo parecido, é bastante provável que, se ela continuar nessa toada, ela acabará terminando, por influência - ela vai querer se relacionar com outras pessoas para ver como é, usará drogas e etc.

Caso ela termine, fale que você a ama muito e que deseja ficar com ela. Explica que as coisas podem ser diferentes, mas deixe-a ir. JAMAIS IMPLORE ou fique atrás dela. Respeite-a. Você vai sofrer. MUITO. Mas vai passar. E, se você não implorou, não ficou atrás, não ficou mandando mensagens ou ligações no meio da noite, e a respeitou é MUITO provável que ela vá querer um dia voltar. Mas talvez fique tarde: você estará em outra. E muito melhor. Caso não seja o caso, vocês se encontrarão no futuro e ficarão juntos novamente.

Em qualquer hipótese, não se preocupe muito com isso. Se preocupe com você.

Again, quit the bullshit. What happens in the rest of the world, is no excuse for the US problem. 

Not to mention the US are negatively impacting the rest of the world.

Other countries have to compete with the US, they can't make too much efforts while the US is doing nothing. International treaties on climate change have failed because of the US. 

&gt;That is by far the largest decline of any country in the world over that timespan and is nearly as large as the 770 million metric ton decline for the entire European Union.

Considering how much more the US emits, this means the US are doing terrible compared to the EU.

Carbon market emissions are not the same as carbon emissions. We have already seen the EU is doing much better in carbon emissions than the US.

An increase in carbon market emissions means the EU is giving more money to support the efforts of other countries.

I think this is a more reasonable approach.  But even this gets difficult as the range of skin color goes from pale ghost to tan to light brown to a very dark brown.  For example, I'm very white but I could prolly tan to become the same skin color as Valerie Jarrett (from the Rossanne controversy) because she's so very light complected, but I'd need to darken skin significantly to pull off Whoopie Goldberg since she's extremely dark.  

&amp;nbsp;

I think we need to go back to context and intent mattering.  Not the context and intent of what people did before any of our lifetimes, but the context and intent of the people doing things now.  

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Also, to be quite blunt, the context of the past is often selectively applied.  Example:  when it comes to slavery and the history of oppression the African people are actually more guilty of this than anyone.  In fact when they were doing apology rounds in Africa for their part in slavery the Ugandan president named Yoweri Museveni went on record saying: ""African chiefs were the ones waging war on each other and capturing their own people and selling them. If anyone should apologies it should be the African chiefs. We still have those traitors here even today"".  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/18/africans-apologise-slave-trade  

You don't hear much about the African involvement in the slave trade though or the millions upon mllions of Europeans they enslaved.  The Barbary Pirates alone enslaved over a million Europeans they sold to North Africa and the Ottoman Empire.  They were based in North Africa.  

&amp;nbsp;

This is not a gotcha, it's not some huge talking point, it's just an example that we focus on some contexts while we let others completely slide by.  I had to do research to learn about all the above and then verify and cross reference it myself, it was never taught or told to me.  

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Maybe it's time we let the blackface stuff fade away by if it's well intentioned with decent context.  Like that German girl who just wanted to cosplay as Michonne from The Walking Dead.  I don't think there should be any problem with someone liking the role played by a black actress so much they wanted to dress up as them.  If anything that should be exactly the sort of bridges we should be trying to build...instead of trying to tear those bridges down.

&amp;nbsp;

And if someone is genuinely being a jerk with it, then yeah vilify them for being a jerk.  Not because of the blackface.  THAT is what it means to move past race IMO and the absolute focus on the blackface instead of the context/intention is what focusing on race looks like IMO.",True,False,False,,0,1541116610,,1541116818,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e8vrqk2,False,t3_9teabz,True,t1_e8von8t,/r/changemyview/comments/9teabz/cmv_being_offended_by_blackface_is_irrational/e8vrqk2/,,1544885291,0,True,False,changemyview,t5_2w2s8,r/changemyview,public,True

The Right Honourable gentleman claims that it would be up to the EU to slap tariffs on the UK, he implies it is a choice. Under such a scenario as created by the folly of the Right Honourable gentleman, they would be legally obligated under GATT to charge MFN tariffs on UK goods.

He then says that all of the customs checks problems will go away because both sides have a ""strong economic interest in keeping trade running smoothly"", that's what a trade deal is Mr Speaker, and he's the one arguing for no deal.

Under a no deal scenario, there is no facilitation for customs, because that is what no deal means. Just as Brexit means Brexit, No Deal means No Deal.

If there's no agreement on sanitary and phytosanitary standards, then it will likely be flat out illegal to export agricultural goods from the UK to the EU. If there's no agreement then there will be no proceedure for confirming compliance of general technical standards to the EU, requiring costly and burdensome preclearance, without which again, exporting becomes illegal.

- Muslims have Muslim countries to live in. America, and Europe (save Bosnia) is not for them. They have to go back!

Yihtzak Rabin was a real person. His election and goals were real. It wasn't so long ago that everyone simply forgot. I believe in a future for Israel where everyone can share the land and its rich deep history equally. Jerusalem is a good start, I personally feel like some of the compromises that are made to prevent certain religions from offending other religions are too restrictive, but it's a start.

Eventually I hope that the model applied to Israel to end the conflict could be applied in other parts of the world to end genocides and displacements of populations. I don't personally believe this will happen for 20 years or more though, after hearing some thoughts of Israelis. It's going to take another generation at least.

When I asked at the end ""who is the bad guy again?"" The rhetorical answer I was going for was ""the West"", for their centuries of anti-Semitism and awfully planned out colonialism that drove Jews to that point. The Sykes-Pichot agreement was before WWI was even over, as a plan for Europe to split up the Ottoman empire with zero consent from the people living there.

People love to make the Jews out to be horrible people in all of this, we're the classic historical scapegoat. But honestly read the history. Ive been trying to read as many perspectives of the history as I can, but it's so difficult to get past propaganda. The Jews in Israel were fighting *against* the British occupying force for God's sake, because it was just more oppression.

&gt;They immigrated to lands that was occupied by people and forced their way in with weapons and support from the West while kicking out the people there.

Early Jewish people immigrating back to Israel certainly wanted to force their way into the status quo, but through normal population growth and land purchases. Violence wasn't their goal. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Aliyah

I've read articles as well about Jewish raids on Arav villages, women and children killed, etc. But this is already after the conflict had begun. These raids were reprehensible and generated anger throughout the region, but were in response to other actions taken against them. It was war at that point.

Remember, when Britain pulled out of Mandatory Palestine, the population in areas like Tzfat was 10% Jewish and 90% Arab. And ""support from the West""??? The police stations were in Arab controlled cities! If anything, Britain supported Palestine far more at the time, because Palestine was the more established population. Jews faught against the British during that time to try to get some freedom instead of the continued oppression they were facing. Jews had less rights, less power, and were facing continued oppression even after WWII. Jews then also returned from WWII to join their compatriots, which is probably what you're thinking of when talking about support from the West.

Modern day government support for Israel simply wasn't there in remotely the same way back during the formation of the country. It was mostly wealthy Western families giving support to the immigrants.

&gt;Imagine Muslims coming to the US with guns and taking a whole state and when we try to defend they throw up a flag and say ""no stop, we're only immigrants"" and then calling us terrorists for shooting back.

The differences here are so vast. Imagine Mexican immigration being huge during the mid to late 1800s, establishing largely Mexican immigrant run areas in the southwest, then imagine Americans rioting and trying to kill them all over the next 40 years until an occupying country took over and policed them both for 20 years. That's more like what happened in Israel. It's simply not comparable.

Edit: I just realized how long and rambling this is. My apologies! I'm trying to build more of a knowledge about the history of the region, and as a Jew I know for certain that I'm getting pretty one sided information. It's almost comical how you can read an article written by an Israeli historian and a Palestinian historian and get two totally different explanations of the event. The peasants revolt is one major example.

I wasn't denying that. In fact, that is why I used the ""-"". They aren't lesser white, they were unjustly seen as that.  

What I'm saying is that non-whites, as a whole, have suffered more of less similar situations.

This is true, but modern Americans or Western Europeans rarely suffer racism at the level of non-white People.

There is nothing different about the current demographic change. Demographic changes have been happening since the founding of the country. Irish, Italian, and Eastern Europeans weren't always seen as white. Heck, even Russians were once not considered white. 

There is nothing remarkable about the current demographic change. There was a time when the tribalistic tensions you mentioned led to the second coming of the Ku Klux Klan. There was also a time when racial tensions made large American cities like New York, Los Angeles, Houston, Chicago, Philadelphia, and others extremely dangerous.

**Improvements:**

\- Ships themselves now have baked in abilities and linked actions (replacing PTL) in many cases, making generics a bit more useful.  Actions/maneuvers that didn't exist until later in the game are added to older ships that need/deserve them (reload on various bombers, s-loops/T-rolls on certain fighters, etc).  **Put differently, the ships themselves are buffed, the pilots and upgrades are nerfed.**

\- Token stacking is an exception, not a norm. 

\- Initiative being from 1 to 6 (with a few ""shoot at i7"" cards/abilities out there) means there's less of a PS war.  It also means that the mid range initiative ships aren't dead weight like they often were as mid level PS ships in 1E.

\- Half points for half damage on all ships

\- Medium base ships

\- Charge tokens limiting use of abilities.  To quote the designers, they found that you could either use something once per game, once per turn, or have it be unlimited.  Now they have some control over how many times in a game you can do it.  Also, this has been placed on all ordnance so when you buy something you can shoot it 2-4 times depending on the missile/torp.

\- Due to rebalancing of ships that were released early in 1E, a game of 2E actually looks like Star Wars, not like a bunch of random EU ships you've only heard of if you played the right video games or read the right comic books (not saying those ships are bad now, just that TIE swarms and X-wings can win tournaments again).  

\- The FORCE!!  Force users can spend force charges to change their eyeballs to hits/evades.  They also take force powers instead of EPTs, which at first I thought was annoying but then I realized was very important for balance.  Don't want someone getting a reroll from predator and then flipping that eyeball to a hit.  Passive mods are kind of dead now.

\- No more 360 degree firing arcs!  All those ships have mobile arcs now (some are two sided bowtie arcs, some are just one).  Rotating the arc costs something, be it an action, a gunner that can do it as part of their ability, etc.

\- Crew has been split into ""gunners"" and ""crew' which limits who can go in what ship.  This is pretty smart from a balance standpoint.

\- Each ship is limited to two attacks per turn, the second being called a bonus attack.  If quickdraw comes back with the same ability, she will no longer be able to double tap twice in a turn, for instance.

\- Rebels/Resistance have been split up, as have the imperials/first order.  This will probably prove smart for balance.

\- Bombs are now dropped before activating.  No more bombs dropped as actions.  

\- The conversion kits themselves.  It's great to have (almost) everything you want as far as upgrades, and the kits are cheaper than buying new ships for ""fix"" cards or other upgrades.

\- FFG have said they will make sure that any upgrade a faction can use appears in a product for that faction.  They've also said there will be a way to get cards so we don't have to go buy the same ships again as they get re-released, but they haven't explained how this will work.

\- For the most part, ""control"" isn't nearly what it used to be.  There are very few cards that punish you for attacking, like R3A2, hotshot copilot,  which has a new name that escapes me right now) is now only when you attack, not when you defend), and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

**Stuff that's not so good:**

\- Although there is less OP nonsense out there, dice variance matters a lot more now.  To the point where I even sometimes say ""I think I only won that because the dice screwed my opponent""  It also means you can spend a load of points on ordnance and have a bad roll followed by a bad reroll (with target lock) and have it go nowhere.  This was always a problem in 1E, but without stuff like guidance chips, expertise, having a focus and a TL easily, etc, it can be frustrating now.

\- Most EPTs are pretty worthless or have a niche role.

\- Although there isn't much of a clear meta just yet, there are a few cards that are definitely annoying that will likely get a cost increase come January.

\- If you like coming up with original, janky ideas, there is a lot less space in which to do that.

\- I actually think games are longer now, based on the fact that we rarely get to squeeze in a third game in our \~4 hour X-wing night at my FLGS.  Some folks say they are shorter, but since it's so hard to get fully modded shots, stuff is harder to kill.  With swarms being more common now, it just takes more time to move around a load of TIEs than a shuttle and two defenders.

&gt;""Getting protected from being offended by what other people say"". Nobody is asking the federal or state government to protect them against hearing opposing viewpoints.

I didn't claim that the tension I identified among feminism's waves was for or against government censorship.  I thought we were talking about SJW's and feminist *social* movements.  If you're not familiar with feminists seeking to protect themselves from disagreeable ideas, then you aren't familiar with feminists on campuses demanding trigger warnings, safe spaces, and disciplinary procedures that eliminate central principles of due process.  Then you aren't familiar with FIRE's superb record at successfully litigating campus speech codes.
https://www.thefire.org/speech-code-litigation-project/

I didn't write that feminists sought protection *by federal and state governments*against being offended, but there is an illiberal branch of modern Progressives who appear envious of European restrictions on ""hate speech.""  Let's also not forget that Democrats (weakly) attempted to amend the 1st Am., as a part of their response to the Citizens United decision.

I'm not making this up this tension within feminism.  Camille Paglia has spoken and written some interesting criticism of modern feminism along these lines. And if you really don't think there are feminists seeking protection from views they find offensive, you should review the reaction to James Damore's Google memo.  Future government censorship is danger posed by this movement, but censorship isn't necessary to demonstrate the present *tension* I accurately described between earlier and later feminist waves.

&gt;As for the party flipping, I'm not going to respond until you do your due diligence and research the topic. 

If you'd rather bow out than defend your repetition of a slur, I'd understand.  Due diligence would include figuring out how much of your own education was the product of Leftist propaganda.  Howard Zinn is an insufficient source.

If you'd like to defend your slur rather than bowing out, I'm amenable to specifying the issues on which you believe the parties flipped, and what evidence you believe supports your belief.  Since this mainly seems to come up regarding racism, I'll note that you offered zero substantive response to my earlier comment.

To Amazon's high paid workers, warehouse employees, monopoly, and delivery truck emissions don't exist.

At Apple, manufacturing slaves and wars for tantalum in the congo don't exist.

At Google, and facebook, the wholesale of people's private data to the oppressive security state and ruthless advertisers doesn't exist.

At Uber, drivers don't exist.

At pharmaceutical companies, opioid addicts and people who can't afford treatments don't exist.

To these companies, 10% of americans and europeans are productive and useful and deserve their fundamental rights and a comfortable life. Everyone else on the planet is cattle to be exploited for every ounce of money and labor you can squeeze out of them, until you've run them dry in which case it's more profitable to let them die.

The wealthy people who work at these companies pay lip-service to abstract causes, but don't dare upset the apple cart. Their concern is a status symbol, and nothing more. Even mentioning organizing around the problems they directly contribute to with their work (to change company policy in a *meaningful* way) is completely unacceptable, the idea is unspeakable and people get angry if you bring it up.

Well, if these countries are going to continue on their course of development continuing to grow their emissions because other countries did in the past, then that means that those countries really don't believe there's a problem. If they did, they'd curb their emissions, no matter what any other countries do or did. 

And the countries that are emitting more than any other country is going to 'take a bit longer'?? We're on about the 10th 'if we don't do something now it'll be too late' scenario. If you believe they can 'take a bit longer', then you don't really believe what the climate scientists are saying about it being too late already.  

&gt;So absolutely tiny countries are irrelevant when it comes to stats like this. 

Yes, and by that logic, the US is irrelevant when it comes to China. Math: 

The difference between what China emits on an annual basis and what the US emits is GREATER than the difference between the US and Curacao. Stop and think about that for a minute. No, really, just think about that. 

&gt;The fact of the matter is though that China hasn't come even close to producing as much CO2 as either the USA

Not yet, but it won't be long now. Currently, China produces more than twice as much as the USA, and the trends suggest that will grow. What will that mean in 10 years? 20 years? 50 years? If you really believe the problem is the rest of this century, then China should be your #1 point of focus. To suggest otherwise ignores math and science in favor of political propaganda.

If there's cars on either side and on the other side of the lot, there isn't enough room to do that entirely so most people just park kinda crooked.

When you reverse in the car pivots way closer to the parking space, and you also don't have cars on either side limiting the movement of the front. So you can line it up in less space and also it makes it easier to leave.

If your car has side view mirrors you can reverse into a spot. I always park my 20 year old CR-V (still a pretty big car by EU standards) by reversing in.

If you have a backup of your local save files (there are two, one with settings and another with data), restore them

Can also try delete local files (make a backup first just in case) and start game; you will get a message indicating that previous data was found on server and if we want to continue playing with that data; we must select ""YES"" (if we select ""No"" we will basically start a new game; and from here there is no way back).

Unfortunately there are various reports with that issue and above options do not solve problem for all.

I also suggest that you contact you local PlayStation Support and post in PS Community Forums (or had a note/comment to ones already there).

OK, lets just take your original point as you intended it. 
You said that the nationalist point of view ultimately leads to ""other things"" which you inferred was tyrany and conquest. The point I was making was that in order to resist tyrany and conquest you need to have a value structure that empowers the individual, you need to combat ideologies who's aim is to seize power. For a lot of people who voted Leave, they see the EU state experiment doing precisely what it is you're referring to - by tyranical. The best way to break up a large, corrupt body, is to fragment it down as far as possible to the point that the individual is empowered. That was the whole point.

Having that said, I personally don't relate at all to this issue. I don't really see this phenomenon in my social circle. I, as well as my friends (who happen to be male) have had plenty of friends (who happen to be female) and no one has ever made a big deal out of it. Of course you can befriend both guys and girls, they're all people, it seems like a no brainer, even though I respect that in a lot of social contexts this still is a hurdle. 


I also can't remember guy friends talking about each others' gfs in an objectifying way, you know, The Room-style ""anyway how's your sex life?"" or frat bro-style bragging about sex. It's all pretty normal stuff ""did you guys have a nice time on holiday"" etc. 


Of course because most of the guys are hetero there is also talk about being attracted to certain women. For example discussing each other's celebrity crushes, ""Jennifer Lawrence /Scarlett Johansson/Gal Gadot was pretty hot in movie X"". The women do that too among eachother I have noticed, I've overheard them talking about the werewolf guy and the vampire dude from Twilight. Also sometimes guys talking among eachother about certain female acquaintances ""well, X is pretty cute"". I'm not sure if that counts as 'objectification', whatever it is, it's an expression of physical attraction which is not the same as reducing an entire gender to their sex appeal. I think. 


I live somewhere in Europe, btw, so I don't know if that makes a difference.

&gt;**EU** **may**[ ...] **withdraw equivalence** [...] **autonomously**

So, in this hypothetical world, our current arrangements are recognised as equivalent to those of the EU. Hardly unsurprising, given that they are those of the EU. 

So, at this point we have one rulebook, followed by and written by both parties.

Then, we leave the EU. Our arrangements continue to be recognised as equivalent to the EU, because they are still from the EU.

So, at this point, we have one rulebook, written and followed by one party, and followed by one party.

Then, we attempt to diverge from the EU's rulebook, which we are following.

So, at this point, we have *two* rulebooks, *one of which is recognised as equivalent by the EU* (the one we were following [The EU's rulebook]), and *the other of which is not recognised as equivalent to the EU (the one we would now be following).

You seem to believe that the EU is *forced* to accept any changes to the rules we make. If the EU decides our rules are not equivalent (if we adjust solvency requirements, for example), then they have a right to cancel their recognition of equivalency.

In which case, we're fucked. The instant crash would ruin us.

Now, the EU is reasonably competent, and would likely warn us that our attempts to ignore the rules would break that recognition. I imagine you can see why our inability to write our own rules because it would destroy our economy might look like vassal statehood.

So, you see, your statement of:

&gt;And the EU will need to follow our rules, and get no say in writing them.

Is only true in the sense that they'll be following 'our' rulebook, which they have full control over.

We are a small semi-casual crew centered mostly in EU and would like to expand our small band of adventurers. Whether you are a veteran or a newcomer, with an advanced grid or a basic one, feel free to join us! A few things to know:


-We enforce no GW contribution quota. We would like everyone to have a good time while in our crew and the will to improve alongside each other. As such during GW you're free to contribute up to your own capability. Advancing is fun and good, burning out isn't.


-As mentioned before, rank, grid etc won't gate you from joinning. Everyone started small and if you wish to improve with our crew we're happy to have you.


-We have Drop Rate, Healing Pots &amp; Charge Bar buffs running 24/7 and a discord server. Feel free to use that or the in-game chat to communicate with the rest of the crew.


-If for whatever reason you need to go inactive, just let us know. We have a 3-weeks-rule when it comes to kicking inactive members that show no sign of existence so new people can join. Three weeks might seem like a long leeway compared to the usual inactivity quotas, but this way everyone has plenty of time to give a heads up if they are unable to play.

David Cameron enjoys a rare distinction: the only prime minister to call a referendum – on a matter of supreme national importance – and then lose it. For this act of hubris, Cameron rightly resigned.


But after more than two years spent writing his memoirs in a garden shed, the former prime minister is reportedly “bored shitless”. Yet rather than, say, taking up a musical instrument, or ploughing through the collected works of Proust, it is claimed that Cameron has set his sights on a bigger prize: the Foreign Office.


The Sun’s political editor Tom Newton Dunn, a reliable source of Cameroon Kremlinology, reports that the former PM “has told friends he is mulling a return to frontline politics, and fancies being foreign secretary”.



Now, admittedly, after the Lilliputian reign of Boris Johnson, it’s not unreasonable for anyone to aspire to lead the Foreign Office. But it would still take a special arrogance for Cameron to believe that he is the man for the job.



History will remember him for little else than Brexit – who now speaks of “the big society”? – but this is merely one of Cameron’s blunders. As prime minister in 2010, it was him, not George Osborne, who made the ultimate decision to impose the austerity that strangled growth and enfeebled the public realm.



Rough sleeping, which fell by three-quarters under the last Labour government, has risen by 169 per cent since 2010. Nearly 1,000 Sure Start children’s centres and 478 libraries are estimated to have closed. Again, so much for “the big society”.


Wherever one looks – the NHS (still recovering from the coalition’s reckless “reorganisation”), the prison system (understaffed and overwhelmed), local government (shrunken councils struggling to meet their legal duties) – the baleful legacy of the Cameron administration is clear.



At the Foreign Office, Cameron, mercifully, would have little sway over domestic policy. But his qualifications for this alternative role are hardly stronger.



He became the first prime minister since Lord North in 1782 to lose a vote on a matter of peace and war after failing to make a compelling case for military action in Syria. In the case of Libya, where the UK did intervene, the Foreign Affairs Select Committee ruled in 2016 that Cameron bears much responsibility for the country’s collapse into civil war. “Through his decision-making in the national security council, former prime minister David Cameron was ultimately responsible for the failure to develop a coherent Libya strategy,” it concluded.

In the European sphere, Cameron heedlessly pandered to Tory Europhobia. He withdrew the Conservatives from the mainstream centre-right EU grouping, aligning his party with assorted far-right nationalists and xenophobes.

Though the pledge helped him secure the Tory leadership in 2005, centre-right leaders were appalled by his opportunism and moral relativism. Angela Merkel, the “auntie” who Cameron hoped would come to his rescue during the Brexit negotiations, felt no compulsion to do so. And when he desperately campaigned for Remain in 2016 – having long derided Brussels as a bureaucratic ogre – few sceptics were prepared to believe him.

Once asked why he wanted to become prime minister, Cameron replied “because I think I’d be good at it”. In his desire to become foreign secretary, this toxic combination of complacency and arrogance has once again asserted itself",True,False,False,,0,1541155764,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",e8wl7eb,True,t3_9tiy76,False,t3_9tiy76,/r/ukpolitics/comments/9tiy76/david_camerons_desire_to_become_foreign_secretary/e8wl7eb/,,1544899053,64,True,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,r/ukpolitics,public,
